CC my guest this week is Paul Coxon Paul

23
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,400
has been working with plants since 2008

24
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,960
his love for plants was a lifelong

25
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,969
passion that developed and grew through

26
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:22,349
the Nebraska Master Gardener program and

27
00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:24,629
through his involvement with human nurse

28
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:26,669
nursery Paul received his Bachelors of

29
00:01:24,629 --> 00:01:28,349
Science from NC State during which time

30
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,629
he published five journal articles

31
00:01:28,349 --> 00:01:32,759
received the International Society for

32
00:01:30,629 --> 00:01:34,949

33
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:37,859
science young minds award say that ten

34
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,540
times fast published over 20 extension

35
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:41,790
and outreach publications and published

36
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,829
three ebooks Paul has a passion for

37
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:45,600
scientific investigation with the end

38
00:01:43,828 --> 00:01:48,029
goal of providing growers and producers

39
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:49,798
with applicable and impactful production

40
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:51,420
knowledge and practices Paul is

41
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:53,490
currently pursuing his master's of

42
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:56,040
science and horticulture at NC State

43
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:59,429
under the direction of dr. Brian he whip

44
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:02,159
ker hey Paul thanks for coming on the

45
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:04,380
show today hey thanks for having me I

46
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,630
really appreciate this

47
00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:08,818
yeah let's go ahead and start off giving

48
00:02:06,629 --> 00:02:10,829
listeners a little bit of your

49
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:12,738
background and how you came into this

50
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:17,520
role that you have at the university

51
00:02:12,739 --> 00:02:20,009
yeah for sure so I have always been

52
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,069
interested in plants ever since I was a

53
00:02:20,009 --> 00:02:24,689
kid they were a passion of mine and that

54
00:02:22,068 --> 00:02:26,579
passion just kind of grew and evolved

55
00:02:24,689 --> 00:02:29,120
over my life I was involved in the

56
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:33,239
Master Gardener program went to numerous

57
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:35,580
extension events and just through kind

58
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:38,159
of a roundabout way ended up at North

59
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:42,000
Carolina State University and I actually

60
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:44,370
got my bachelor's here and it started

61
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
working with plants under dr. Brian whip

62
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:50,730
Kerr doing floriculture work with him

63
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,659
and continued working with him through

64
00:02:50,729 --> 00:02:53,879
my bachelors

65
00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:56,370
and the opportunity came for me to sign

66
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:59,549
on with the Masters for him and I'm

67
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:02,009
currently you're into that and it's been

68
00:02:59,549 --> 00:03:05,840
one wild ride and never expected to be

69
00:03:02,009 --> 00:03:07,979
doing work with cannabis but here we are

70
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,079
yeah you told me a little bit about that

71
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:11,639
off air how you guys applied for a

72
00:03:10,079 --> 00:03:14,370
license and we're able to get one and

73
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:17,789
have started doing some research with

74
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:19,379
cannabis or more specifically hemp do

75
00:03:17,789 --> 00:03:21,269
you want to talk a little about some of

76
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:22,289
the papers that you there's some of the

77
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:27,810
research that's happened at your

78
00:03:22,289 --> 00:03:29,759
university yeah sure so yeah it's the

79
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:33,269
way that we got involved in cannabis

80
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:34,590
it's kind of a roundabout story dr.

81
00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:36,450
Witter and I were just kind of talking

82
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:39,719
one day in the greenhouse just you know

83
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:41,578
shooting the breeze and I joked with him

84
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:44,069
and said you know hey let's you know

85
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:45,930
work in him because hemp had just become

86
00:03:44,069 --> 00:03:48,180
legalized in our state you know he kind

87
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:50,159
of laughed at it and then two months

88
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,569
later he contacted me is like hey I've

89
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:54,180
just applied for a license we're gonna

90
00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:56,699
be doing work with him and you know ever

91
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:58,680
since then it's been just one crazy

92
00:03:56,699 --> 00:04:00,719
research project after another and it's

93
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,629
opened a lot of amazing doors for us so

94
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:05,310
we're really glad that we got into it

95
00:04:02,629 --> 00:04:10,829
but as far as some of the work that

96
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:13,590
we've done we got into cannabis and you

97
00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:15,900
know normally when you are looking at

98
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:16,769
researching a new area you know you jump

99
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,750
on

100
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:19,949
and you'll do a literature review and

101
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:22,168
look at you know published literature

102
00:04:19,949 --> 00:04:24,000
and you know I got on and jumped on

103
00:04:22,168 --> 00:04:28,889
Google Scholar and typed in either

104
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:31,228
cannabis sativa and I think I used the

105
00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:34,620
all in title function and I got 12

106
00:04:31,228 --> 00:04:38,758
results and it was then that I knew that

107
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:41,908
we were in for one wild ride so we

108
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:44,759
basically had to start at the foundation

109
00:04:41,908 --> 00:04:46,800
as far as research goes because you know

110
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:50,120
we wanted to establish some baselines

111
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:55,889
for nutrients for lighting for growing

112
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:59,098
pH work etc so that's that's kind of how

113
00:04:55,889 --> 00:05:01,379
we got started I can go more into the

114
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:04,319
specific projects that we've done if

115
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:07,370
you'd like yeah let's do it why don't

116
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:09,930
you tell us about your first foray into

117
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:12,418
indie cannabis research and just for

118
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:13,680
listeners to let them know I do have one

119
00:05:12,418 --> 00:05:15,839
of your papers in front of me the

120
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,189
characterization of nutrient disorders

121
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:19,019
of cannabis sativa so we'll probably

122
00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:20,490
spend a little more time on that I'm

123
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:22,439
gonna be kind of flying blind on

124
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:25,379
questions is I don't have the access to

125
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:26,668
the other papers at this time but yeah

126
00:05:25,379 --> 00:05:28,620
if you want to kind of describe some of

127
00:05:26,668 --> 00:05:29,908
the research that you've done and what

128
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,490
some of your findings we're I'd love to

129
00:05:29,908 --> 00:05:33,110
kind of go through that in a little more

130
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:36,538
detail

131
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:40,199
yeah for sure um so one of the first

132
00:05:36,538 --> 00:05:42,990
things that we did was look starting

133
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:46,110
from the ground up basically or the soil

134
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:50,098
up the two first projects that we

135
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:54,389
started doing we were looking at optimal

136
00:05:50,098 --> 00:05:57,959
rooting through clonal cuttings because

137
00:05:54,389 --> 00:05:59,460
we realized quickly that sourcing

138
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:01,739
through seed was just not the way to go

139
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:04,918
so we started cloning propagating

140
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:10,379
everything but we were experiencing a

141
00:06:04,918 --> 00:06:14,310
huge variety of rooting habits and

142
00:06:10,379 --> 00:06:17,519
successes when trying to clone root

143
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:19,228
cannabis clonally and in the flora

144
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:21,269
culture industry we've had a long time

145
00:06:19,228 --> 00:06:23,370
to kind of standardize things so that

146
00:06:21,269 --> 00:06:25,379
variability that we're seeing really

147
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:27,509
intrigued us so one of the first two

148
00:06:25,379 --> 00:06:29,670
studies we did we did a reading study

149
00:06:27,509 --> 00:06:32,270
and that has been published

150
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:35,100
we looked at these a bottom heat and

151
00:06:32,269 --> 00:06:38,490
also the diameter of the cutting the

152
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:40,590
caliper looking at how those two factors

153
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:44,759
would impact routing vigor and routing

154
00:06:40,589 --> 00:06:47,129
success and then the next piece of work

155
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:50,399
that we did was looking at optimal

156
00:06:47,129 --> 00:06:53,519
substrate PHS and that was in tandem

157
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:57,479
with another lab here at NC State doing

158
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:59,099
work there the substrates lab so those

159
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:02,280
were the kind of the foundation that we

160
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:04,920
did and then from there we kind of went

161
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:06,750
into the nutrient deficiency work that

162
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,460
you have in front of you trying to

163
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:10,829
characterize nutrients and nutrient

164
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:15,239
deficiencies and then we've also had

165
00:07:10,829 --> 00:07:18,449
another study published where we went

166
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:20,639
into lighting and photo period a bit

167
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:22,649
we're looking at daylight extension

168
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:25,379
lighting regimes versus nine

169
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:26,879
interruption of lighting regimes and I

170
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:30,680
guess I should back up the very first

171
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:34,740
study that we did was a baseline hemp

172
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:36,930
nutrients leaf tissue survey because we

173
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:38,610
had no idea what optimal nutrients were

174
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:41,430
so we traveled around the state to

175
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:43,080
different growers operations and we took

176
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:49,079
samples off of their plants and sent

177
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:51,569
them into the lab here in CDA and got

178
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:53,609
some values back and established the

179
00:07:51,569 --> 00:07:57,060
baseline and that work has also been

180
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:58,379
published well I kind of want to talk

181
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,280
about the findings from each of these

182
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:02,939
because I think they're all really

183
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:04,199
interesting but let's start with what

184
00:08:02,939 --> 00:08:06,000
you were just describing they're

185
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:11,060
incurred of just surveying and

186
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:15,720
establishing sort of ranges for cannabis

187
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:16,589
using tissue tissue analysis what can

188
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,630
you talk about the sort of the

189
00:08:16,589 --> 00:08:21,539
methodology of that and that process and

190
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:25,290
how you determined what a healthy plant

191
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:28,230
look like in terms of those ranges yes

192
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:31,110
so this was kind of the dirty mucky

193
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:34,500
science that very few scientists will

194
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:38,310
actually want to reveal it's very

195
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:41,460
foundational work most of the time when

196
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:43,559
you're dealing with a new crop or a new

197
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:46,710
discovered crop it's kind of

198
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:49,169
shotgun approach so one of the reasons

199
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:52,800
that we went through multiple different

200
00:08:49,169 --> 00:08:54,509
locations to try and find healthy plants

201
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:56,370
is because you know fertilizer types

202
00:08:54,509 --> 00:08:59,539
were different and growing conditions

203
00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:02,129
were different and you know the kind of

204
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:04,049
you know management strategies were

205
00:09:02,129 --> 00:09:05,610
different the irrigation was different

206
00:09:04,049 --> 00:09:07,019
and that that introduced a lot of

207
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:09,840
variability so we were trying to

208
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:13,799
homogenize the landscape by taking a

209
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:16,500
general survey and that is not to be

210
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:18,299
used as kind of like the golden rule of

211
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,950
you know this is what adequate leaf

212
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:23,279
tissue parts per million

213
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:25,500
looks like the survey was just meant to

214
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:28,409
be more of an informational guideline to

215
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:31,110
growers saying that you know these

216
00:09:28,409 --> 00:09:34,139
plants which appeared healthy and were

217
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:36,570
growing vigorously had adequate nutrient

218
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:39,779
ranges and from what we can infer from

219
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:43,050
other crops they appear to be within the

220
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:45,629
healthy range and that work that kind of

221
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:48,059
springboarded into the nutrient

222
00:09:45,629 --> 00:09:52,679
disorders work which is getting closer

223
00:09:48,059 --> 00:09:56,549
to establishing fertility guidelines for

224
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:57,809
cannabis got it so what you're

225
00:09:56,549 --> 00:09:59,609
essentially what you're saying is you

226
00:09:57,809 --> 00:10:02,069
don't want people to draw too many

227
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:05,490
conclusions from your preliminary work

228
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:07,290
there or that paper other than to see

229
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:10,950
that there may be a possible range here

230
00:10:07,289 --> 00:10:13,019
of a tissue of elements in the tissue

231
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:15,540
that maybe allow you to grow what

232
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:17,970
appears to be a healthy plant correct

233
00:10:15,539 --> 00:10:19,889
yeah so science is a very additive

234
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:22,470
process and the more and more

235
00:10:19,889 --> 00:10:24,679
experiments you do in a specific

236
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:28,200
research direction or research question

237
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:31,409
they begin to add together to form the

238
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:33,990
whole picture and from that then you can

239
00:10:31,409 --> 00:10:35,850
start inferring and making guidelines so

240
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:39,960
we're getting close with some of the

241
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:42,180
work that we've done but it's like like

242
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:44,940
I said cannabis is still very new for

243
00:10:42,179 --> 00:10:46,939
research and so we're still just you

244
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:50,820
know beginning to green gained traction

245
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:52,770
with the research I think that's a

246
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:56,030
really good point that you're making

247
00:10:52,769 --> 00:10:57,240
there so that people will consider how

248
00:10:56,029 --> 00:10:59,009
you know

249
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,899
this may point them in in sort of a

250
00:10:59,009 --> 00:11:02,700
direction of a trend but there's still

251
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:05,039
so much research than needs to be done I

252
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:06,810
mean if you were talking about a you

253
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,189
know an established crop like corn you'd

254
00:11:06,809 --> 00:11:11,369
find thousands of papers just on

255
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:12,750
nitrogen that could discuss this and a

256
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:14,519
lot of tissue work that's been done

257
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:17,220
across a variety of different scenarios

258
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:20,610
and environments to where you you can

259
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:22,290
start really drawing strong correlations

260
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:25,649
but we just don't have any of that work

261
00:11:22,289 --> 00:11:28,819
so it's it's still very preliminary like

262
00:11:25,649 --> 00:11:32,370
you'd like you mentioned exactly yes I

263
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:36,990
did want to you mention propagation I

264
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:40,669
did have Dr Kaplan Darren Kaplan on from

265
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:42,990
the Guelph he did work with dr. Zhang on

266
00:11:40,669 --> 00:11:45,208
propagation already now I don't know did

267
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:48,600
your work come before or after their

268
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:51,389
paper which was released in I think May

269
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:53,879
of 2018 and is there any correlation

270
00:11:51,389 --> 00:11:55,769
there or any anything that you found

271
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:58,350
that sort of fit or didn't fit with the

272
00:11:55,769 --> 00:12:02,309
work that they did yes

273
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:05,610
so Kathleen's work came before ours ours

274
00:12:02,309 --> 00:12:09,629
was just published at the end of I

275
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:13,169
believe it was 2018 is when ours came

276
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:16,740
out so his work came before ours and as

277
00:12:13,169 --> 00:12:18,708
far as the the correlations between the

278
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:21,419
two works there were some similarities

279
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:24,028
but for the most part we were also

280
00:12:21,419 --> 00:12:25,349
exploring slightly different things you

281
00:12:24,028 --> 00:12:28,350
know for example he used rooting

282
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:30,240
hormones and he his work and we did not

283
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:35,490
look at rooting hormones we were looking

284
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:37,500
more at the caliper and bottom heat so

285
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:38,669
when you say caliper just for people who

286
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:42,240
may not be familiar with the term you're

287
00:12:38,669 --> 00:12:49,519
talking about the measurement of the

288
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:51,899
diameter of the stem and when you say

289
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:54,000
sorry so you were measuring you're

290
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:56,250
measuring the caliper in terms of the

291
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,129
routing success of that particular

292
00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:02,929
cutting is that correct yeah so

293
00:12:59,129 --> 00:13:07,259
basically when floriculture

294
00:13:02,929 --> 00:13:09,809
when you're trying to establish a more

295
00:13:07,259 --> 00:13:13,919
vigorous cutting

296
00:13:09,809 --> 00:13:15,899
a vegetative cutting you'll apply heat

297
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:17,610
to the bottom of the tray or bottom of

298
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:20,250
the bench or close to the bottom and

299
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:22,850
that increases the temperature of the

300
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:26,970
substrate and what that does is it helps

301
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:30,600
speed up the routing across us in some

302
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:32,100
species in others that will have little

303
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,080
to no effect so we were trying to

304
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:35,670
explore that and then the other area

305
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:38,550
that we were exploring is the caliper

306
00:13:35,669 --> 00:13:41,219
which when you take a tip cutting from

307
00:13:38,549 --> 00:13:43,019
another stock plant and you kind of take

308
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,250
the tip portion and you point it away

309
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:46,230
from yourself and you look at the end

310
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:47,789
that you cut it and then you were to

311
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:51,930
measure the diameter of that that would

312
00:13:47,789 --> 00:13:54,209
be the caliper and the theory was that a

313
00:13:51,929 --> 00:13:56,909
thicker caliper could potentially have

314
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:59,430
more surface area for the callus to

315
00:13:56,909 --> 00:14:02,100
increase route proliferation and a

316
00:13:59,429 --> 00:14:05,278
thicker caliper could also potentially

317
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:09,240
have more reserves so more photosynthate

318
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:12,389
etc that the plant could draw on to help

319
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:13,919
with the healing and reading process was

320
00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:18,659
kind of the line of thinking that we

321
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:22,199
went down and did your research support

322
00:14:18,659 --> 00:14:26,370
your hypothesis yes so what we found

323
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:30,120
that was that we divided calipers into 3

324
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:32,700
differents sizes small medium and large

325
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:34,169
as far as the caliper was concerned and

326
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:36,089
we did find that there was a

327
00:14:34,169 --> 00:14:42,509
statistically significant difference in

328
00:14:36,089 --> 00:14:44,880
routing between the the small caliper

329
00:14:42,509 --> 00:14:47,309
and the large caliper but not between

330
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:50,189
the small in the medium or the meteor in

331
00:14:47,309 --> 00:14:52,949
the large caliper and so what that means

332
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:55,740
is that when we actually looked at the

333
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:57,629
date of routing the bigger routing and

334
00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:00,450
we actually then screened the routing

335
00:14:57,629 --> 00:15:04,250
through a visual scale that the larger

336
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:07,110
caliper produced more vigorous roots

337
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:10,500
rather than when compared to the small

338
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:12,230
caliper and when you say large I assume

339
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:16,259
you're still talking about fairly

340
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:18,420
immature vegetative plants I do know

341
00:15:16,259 --> 00:15:21,059
that cannabis can develop a woody or

342
00:15:18,419 --> 00:15:23,819
stem over time which can it appears to

343
00:15:21,059 --> 00:15:25,769
inhibit cloning or

344
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:27,690
propagation I can you talk a little bit

345
00:15:25,769 --> 00:15:30,029
about your how you established your

346
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:32,670
experiment and what what you really were

347
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:37,230
comparing there yeah so to answer your

348
00:15:32,669 --> 00:15:41,689
question how we kind of went along the

349
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:44,909
lines of exploring how to quantify the

350
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:47,610
size of the cutting or the caliper we

351
00:15:44,909 --> 00:15:50,879
actually went in to mother stock plants

352
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:53,879
we took some other stock plants and we

353
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:56,189
took vegetative kind of things off of

354
00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:58,169
those and the paper goes into a little

355
00:15:56,190 --> 00:16:00,510
more detail on how we quantified that I

356
00:15:58,169 --> 00:16:03,209
won't bore you with the details here but

357
00:16:00,509 --> 00:16:05,250
we divided all of the cuttings kind of

358
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:07,290
did a survey and looked at the different

359
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:11,610
calipers and the different caliper pools

360
00:16:07,289 --> 00:16:14,819
and from that we came up with the sizes

361
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:20,190
that we used for our study and the small

362
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:21,990
size was 1.7 to 2 millimeters medium

363
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:24,720
size was two point three to two point

364
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:26,700
six millimeters and the large caliper

365
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:30,060
was two point nine to three point two

366
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:33,500
millimeters and so that's that's kind of

367
00:16:30,059 --> 00:16:34,649
the general process of how we approached

368
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:38,129
categorizing

369
00:16:34,649 --> 00:16:41,039
what a typical caliper would be on an

370
00:16:38,129 --> 00:16:43,139
arm other stock plants that we were

371
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:44,059
managing and then how we divided them up

372
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:46,860
through the study

373
00:16:44,059 --> 00:16:49,979
now did you look at where on the plant

374
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:51,810
itself that the cutting was taken from

375
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:54,629
in terms of from near the top of the

376
00:16:51,809 --> 00:16:56,699
plants near the base of the plant

377
00:16:54,629 --> 00:17:01,139
was that something that was factored in

378
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:04,410
it all in this particular study yeah so

379
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:07,709
we only took from secondary tertiary and

380
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:11,720
quaternary branches and basically what

381
00:17:07,709 --> 00:17:14,100
that means is you have the central stalk

382
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:16,470
from which all the other branches come

383
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:18,688
off so that's considered the primary and

384
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:20,970
so any branch that comes off of that

385
00:17:18,689 --> 00:17:22,019
would be secondary any consecutive

386
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:25,350
branch that comes off of that would be

387
00:17:22,019 --> 00:17:27,750
tertiary so on and so forth and like I

388
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:32,369
said the paper which is freely available

389
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:35,549
through Murray State University the

390
00:17:32,369 --> 00:17:37,189
Journal of agriculture agricultural hemp

391
00:17:35,549 --> 00:17:40,069
research

392
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:41,920
has a wonderful diagram in there on how

393
00:17:40,069 --> 00:17:45,319
we actually took the cuttings and

394
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:48,470
quantified the branches but as far as

395
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:50,899
looking at say an interior canopy

396
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:55,220
cutting versus an exterior canopy

397
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:57,860
cutting we were only taking shoot tips

398
00:17:55,220 --> 00:18:01,180
from the exterior portion of the canopy

399
00:17:57,859 --> 00:18:05,209
and what I mean by a shoot tip is only

400
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:08,120
the terminal growing portion of a

401
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:11,870
cutting so it terminated in a growing

402
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:13,279
tip that makes sense yeah so you weren't

403
00:18:11,869 --> 00:18:15,319
you weren't taking more than one cutting

404
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:17,359
off of that that branch so in theory you

405
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:20,389
could go down another few inches and

406
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:22,879
take another cutting but you didn't do

407
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:25,190
that for this experiment okay I get were

408
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:28,220
saying were there any other findings

409
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:30,350
from this particular study that you

410
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:32,269
wanted to share besides what you just

411
00:18:30,349 --> 00:18:37,579
shared regarding caliper larger caliper

412
00:18:32,269 --> 00:18:40,339
reading better than smaller caliper yes

413
00:18:37,579 --> 00:18:41,960
so like I said that there was a

414
00:18:40,339 --> 00:18:44,269
statistically significant difference

415
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:50,150
between the small caliper and the large

416
00:18:44,269 --> 00:18:53,509
caliper and as far as the percentage of

417
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:57,290
cuttings that had rooted at 14 days

418
00:18:53,509 --> 00:19:00,019
versus 28 days there was a statistical

419
00:18:57,289 --> 00:19:02,329
difference in this study between adding

420
00:19:00,019 --> 00:19:05,389
root zone heating or bottom heating

421
00:19:02,329 --> 00:19:08,689
versus not utilizing about a bottom

422
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:11,300
heating so that was another interesting

423
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:14,269
question interesting finding from the

424
00:19:11,299 --> 00:19:16,849
study rather what was your control

425
00:19:14,269 --> 00:19:19,220
temperature and then what did you raise

426
00:19:16,849 --> 00:19:22,549
it to with the the root zone - with the

427
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:25,610
bottom heating and how statistically

428
00:19:22,549 --> 00:19:31,059
significant are we talking across adding

429
00:19:25,609 --> 00:19:34,219
that heat matter heat source yeah so the

430
00:19:31,059 --> 00:19:36,919
what we did is we measured the substrate

431
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:38,960
temperature so the substrate temperature

432
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:42,410
was twenty seven point eight degrees

433
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:47,480
centigrade without root zone heating and

434
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:50,120
then it was sorry that was with root

435
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,900
zone heating and the average temperature

436
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:55,099
was 25

437
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:58,670
six degrees centigrade without so we

438
00:19:55,099 --> 00:20:02,329
increased the root zone temperature by

439
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:04,070
roughly two degrees centigrade okay just

440
00:20:02,329 --> 00:20:06,980
to save all of us Americans who are

441
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:08,809
terrible at Celsius I'm gonna do this

442
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:11,269
calculation for people so twenty eight

443
00:20:08,809 --> 00:20:13,669
point seven Celsius is eighty three

444
00:20:11,269 --> 00:20:15,710
point six six degrees Fahrenheit that

445
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:20,980
was your heated temperature what was

446
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:22,480
your sorry what was the control again

447
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:25,160
yes

448
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:28,400
sorry that's twenty seven point eight

449
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:30,980
degrees centigrade for the treatment

450
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,970
oh okay so the treatment was twenty

451
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:37,789
seven points so 82 degrees Fahrenheit

452
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:40,089
correct and then for the control it was

453
00:20:37,789 --> 00:20:45,019
twenty five point six degrees centigrade

454
00:20:40,089 --> 00:20:48,589
or 78 degrees Fahrenheit okay so not a

455
00:20:45,019 --> 00:20:51,309
dramatic rise in temperature but you

456
00:20:48,589 --> 00:20:54,669
still found statistically significant

457
00:20:51,309 --> 00:20:57,109
statistically significant better routing

458
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:59,300
correct that's actually surprising to me

459
00:20:57,109 --> 00:21:02,779
that I would just that few of a degrees

460
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:05,750
could raise your rooting success that

461
00:21:02,779 --> 00:21:10,009
that much that's really interesting yeah

462
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:11,690
so when when doing a study like this you

463
00:21:10,009 --> 00:21:13,640
don't want to raise the temperature the

464
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:15,680
root zone temperature too much because

465
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:19,580
you don't want to potentially desiccate

466
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:23,150
or damage any roots that are forming or

467
00:21:19,579 --> 00:21:25,639
even the catalyst as it forms so that's

468
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:30,950
why the temperature differential wasn't

469
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:32,930
overly large yeah I would have thought

470
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:37,400
that maybe the control temperature might

471
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:39,799
have been lower rather than the heated

472
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:43,910
temperature be higher but no that's

473
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:46,819
great yeah we this experiment was

474
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:49,820
conducted during the summer so we were

475
00:21:46,819 --> 00:21:52,879
in a poly house and the cooling

476
00:21:49,819 --> 00:21:55,849
coefficient on a poly house is much less

477
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:58,100
so that's why the temperatures were a

478
00:21:55,849 --> 00:22:01,369
little higher for the control that makes

479
00:21:58,099 --> 00:22:03,949
sense that makes sense okay great so

480
00:22:01,369 --> 00:22:07,759
let's move on to another one of the

481
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:08,929
papers that you mentioned prior to you

482
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:14,230
know prior to talking about this

483
00:22:08,929 --> 00:22:17,659
nutrient disordered paper okay are used

484
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:19,460
the substrate pH work the other one that

485
00:22:17,659 --> 00:22:21,679
we did kind of on that ground-up

486
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:23,419
approach we're still in the process of

487
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:25,909
publishing on paper so that one has

488
00:22:23,419 --> 00:22:29,120
happened at least yet those results will

489
00:22:25,909 --> 00:22:33,130
be forthcoming okay I understand so

490
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:35,209
maybe we do dive right into the nutrient

491
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:41,120
nutrient disorder paper that you wrote

492
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:43,220
or co-authored okay now one of the

493
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:45,009
things you talked about with this paper

494
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:47,750
was that you guys really are a team

495
00:22:45,009 --> 00:22:49,759
there at the university is there any

496
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:51,349
anything you want to mention prior to

497
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:52,490
starting talking about or did you want

498
00:22:51,349 --> 00:22:54,288
to kind of as we go through the paper

499
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:57,980
mention the people that were involved in

500
00:22:54,288 --> 00:22:58,548
different aspects of this work yeah

501
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:03,860
that'd be great

502
00:22:58,548 --> 00:23:05,778
yeah so in our lab we have been really

503
00:23:03,859 --> 00:23:08,869
blessed to have a group of fantastic

504
00:23:05,778 --> 00:23:10,548
researchers and collaborators that we've

505
00:23:08,869 --> 00:23:12,199
worked with on all of these projects

506
00:23:10,548 --> 00:23:16,069
both the projects that we have completed

507
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:19,669
have published and are doing so yeah

508
00:23:16,069 --> 00:23:21,648
Gaby Barajas Patrick needs the David

509
00:23:19,669 --> 00:23:24,950
Logan Matthew Davis

510
00:23:21,648 --> 00:23:26,959
Kimberly McAllister our collaborator dr.

511
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:30,649
Michelle Schroeder Moreno our other

512
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:33,889
collaborator dr. Brian Jackson and my

513
00:23:30,648 --> 00:23:36,158
major professor dr. Brian Becker we all

514
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:38,269
form a fantastic team of collaborators

515
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:39,710
some of these people have been involved

516
00:23:38,269 --> 00:23:41,750
on all the projects others are

517
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:44,090
collaborators on some projects but

518
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:47,750
research definitely does not take place

519
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:49,788
in a vacuum and as far as the research

520
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:51,700
process goes we've been really blessed I

521
00:23:49,788 --> 00:23:56,089
have some amazing collaborators and

522
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:58,580
people in our lab that's great I mean it

523
00:23:56,089 --> 00:24:00,109
really does take a team and I think it's

524
00:23:58,579 --> 00:24:02,028
important to recognize that when you see

525
00:24:00,109 --> 00:24:03,939
a name on a paper that's not the full

526
00:24:02,028 --> 00:24:06,589
story of the work that went into it so

527
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:07,639
thanks for highlighting that now this

528
00:24:06,589 --> 00:24:09,678
paper itself

529
00:24:07,638 --> 00:24:11,869
it's called characterization of nutrient

530
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:14,028
disorders of cannabis sativa it was

531
00:24:11,869 --> 00:24:16,369
brought to my attention recently I mean

532
00:24:14,028 --> 00:24:17,559
it's only was published in October 18th

533
00:24:16,369 --> 00:24:19,509
of 2009

534
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:22,029
tene do you want to give a quick

535
00:24:19,509 --> 00:24:23,500
highlight or sort of a rough idea of

536
00:24:22,029 --> 00:24:25,720
what the abstract was with this paper

537
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:30,130
and what your goals were when you first

538
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:31,720
started doing this research yeah so like

539
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:35,470
I said the first paper that we published

540
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:37,150
was that general survey paper and that

541
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:39,220
one is published and that's meant to be

542
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:41,350
kind of a shotgun approach to guidelines

543
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:42,819
you know these were the ranges we saw in

544
00:24:41,349 --> 00:24:46,929
multiple different cultivars across

545
00:24:42,819 --> 00:24:48,759
different growing conditions this one is

546
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:54,190
trying to be a little more targeted and

547
00:24:48,759 --> 00:24:57,309
kind of narrow in on optimal fertility

548
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:58,870
recommendations for him and trying to

549
00:24:57,309 --> 00:25:01,750
figure out what kind of fertility

550
00:24:58,869 --> 00:25:05,309
cannabis plants need in order to balance

551
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:10,420
the nutrient cost input to growers and

552
00:25:05,309 --> 00:25:11,919
maximize the you know CBD content and

553
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:16,960
flower content depending on what you're

554
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:19,539
growing for so for this specific work we

555
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:22,029
were looking at nutrient deficiencies so

556
00:25:19,539 --> 00:25:27,490
what that means is we were trying to

557
00:25:22,029 --> 00:25:30,129
stress the plants down to a level where

558
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:33,549
we could visually see symptoms of

559
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:38,410
nutrient stress and then we could take

560
00:25:33,549 --> 00:25:41,740
foliar leaf tissue and send that off to

561
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:44,860
lab and compare that to plants that we

562
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:47,259
grew with a complete fertility machine

563
00:25:44,859 --> 00:25:49,569
and that complete fertility regime is

564
00:25:47,259 --> 00:25:53,859
based off of what's called a modified

565
00:25:49,569 --> 00:25:57,819
Hoagland solution it's a standard

566
00:25:53,859 --> 00:26:00,369
hydroponic water-soluble nutrient

567
00:25:57,819 --> 00:26:02,470
fertilizer regime that basically

568
00:26:00,369 --> 00:26:06,099
balances all of the cations and anions

569
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:08,289
and is supposed to provide a plant with

570
00:26:06,099 --> 00:26:10,299
everything that it needs as far as its

571
00:26:08,289 --> 00:26:13,659
macro and micronutrients are concerned

572
00:26:10,299 --> 00:26:17,799
so we were trying to withhold an element

573
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:20,050
from a plant from that recipe to induce

574
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:22,799
our deficiency and they compared those

575
00:26:20,049 --> 00:26:25,690
visual symptoms and the leaf tissue

576
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:27,609
analyses back to that plant and that

577
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:31,000
plant that received everything was our

578
00:26:27,609 --> 00:26:31,490
control now are there is there research

579
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,960
out there

580
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:39,558
showing and success and growing with

581
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:42,350
this Hoagland solution or a formula with

582
00:26:39,558 --> 00:26:43,819
cannabis or were you kind of going into

583
00:26:42,349 --> 00:26:46,189
a little bit of new territory with that

584
00:26:43,819 --> 00:26:51,649
in terms of is making pulling from other

585
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:53,808
crops yeah so dr. wicker myself

586
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:59,600
numerous other scientists have used the

587
00:26:53,808 --> 00:27:03,049
solution to provide fertility for a wide

588
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:07,129
array of plants so as far as specific to

589
00:27:03,049 --> 00:27:09,169
cannabis no we were the first to kind of

590
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:12,740
pioneer a Hoagland solution with

591
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:14,980
cannabis but as far as the general

592
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:17,450
literature is concerned it has been

593
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:19,460
tested on numerous different plants

594
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:24,289
numerous different crops and proved to

595
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:24,950
be adequate okay so and just out of

596
00:27:24,289 --> 00:27:26,450
curiosity

597
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:28,490
so as you started growing with this

598
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:31,850
toquyen solution is this baseline for

599
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:34,269
fertility just anecdotally you found

600
00:27:31,849 --> 00:27:37,129
that it seemed to be providing

601
00:27:34,269 --> 00:27:38,808
appropriate nutrient levels across the

602
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:44,330
board for macro and micro nutrients for

603
00:27:38,808 --> 00:27:46,730
for cannabis correct yes and so kind of

604
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:49,189
how the research logic goes is we took a

605
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:51,740
broad survey approach that was our first

606
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:54,340
paper and then we kind of wanted to see

607
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:57,109
what would happen if we took away a

608
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:58,970
singular nutrient from the plant and

609
00:27:57,109 --> 00:28:01,399
what that would do to the leaf tissue

610
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:04,429
value is compared to the survey that we

611
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:06,290
had and what that would do to the you

612
00:28:04,429 --> 00:28:09,170
know control plant that was receiving

613
00:28:06,289 --> 00:28:10,940
adequate fertility that has been proven

614
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:14,990
to the adequate for multiple different

615
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:16,610
crop species and then currently what

616
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:19,000
we're doing and I know we're getting off

617
00:28:16,609 --> 00:28:21,500
track a bit but currently we are then

618
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,869
modifying the Hoagland solution the

619
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:27,049
solution for all macro and

620
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:32,899
micronutrients at different rates to try

621
00:28:27,049 --> 00:28:35,329
and get a fully relief tissue curve if

622
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:38,960
that makes sense so from you know say

623
00:28:35,329 --> 00:28:41,599
like zero parts per million into 2.5 so

624
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:45,410
on and so forth to try and establish a

625
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:49,849
curve for fertility as far

626
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:53,180
as fullier analyses are concerned okay

627
00:28:49,849 --> 00:28:55,009
yeah that makes sense yeah I was just I

628
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:57,350
was just kind of curious where you came

629
00:28:55,009 --> 00:28:58,460
up with this for you know a baseline for

630
00:28:57,349 --> 00:29:02,869
your control because I think that's

631
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:04,009
important for people to understand when

632
00:29:02,869 --> 00:29:05,209
you start talking about what you're

633
00:29:04,009 --> 00:29:09,079
removing it's good to know where you

634
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:11,660
were starting that's all okay I want to

635
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:13,220
get into a little bit of the methodology

636
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:15,019
here but just I had a couple things in

637
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:16,819
the introduction that you guys mentioned

638
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:17,839
in terms of relating back to prior work

639
00:29:16,819 --> 00:29:19,460
that had been done that I thought was

640
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:21,139
kind of interesting and I didn't know

641
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:23,569
maybe it's something you can touch on

642
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:25,280
maybe it's just something that pretty

643
00:29:23,569 --> 00:29:26,569
much the sentences that you put in there

644
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:29,779
say at all but I kind of wanted to bring

645
00:29:26,569 --> 00:29:32,029
him bring him out in hemp fiber in hemp

646
00:29:29,779 --> 00:29:33,710
fiber varieties Bosca itaú reported

647
00:29:32,029 --> 00:29:36,799
higher levels of nitrogen increased

648
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:39,640
plant leaf weight and decreased leaf THC

649
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:44,649
content presumably due to THC dilution

650
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:47,810
can you touch on that at all yeah so

651
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:50,600
that work in particular like I said once

652
00:29:47,809 --> 00:29:52,159
when I actually went into this and was

653
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:53,929
doing a literature review and trying to

654
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:57,320
get a good feel for the kind of research

655
00:29:53,930 --> 00:30:02,019
that had been done there was not much

656
00:29:57,319 --> 00:30:04,669
out there so this introduction is quite

657
00:30:02,019 --> 00:30:07,970
bare-bones when it comes to a normal

658
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:09,980
introduction and literature review but

659
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:12,740
essentially what we're trying to say

660
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:15,230
there I think what the article was

661
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:16,940
trying to get out is first I would like

662
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:20,089
to draw your attention to the fact that

663
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:24,230
this is a fiber variety so we were

664
00:30:20,089 --> 00:30:26,029
growing a high CBD clone so the growth

665
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:28,099
habit and growth parameters are

666
00:30:26,029 --> 00:30:29,660
different for fiber varieties you want

667
00:30:28,099 --> 00:30:31,069
them to be very tall you're trying to

668
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:33,470
get you know plant them very densely

669
00:30:31,069 --> 00:30:35,750
they're in a field condition typically

670
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:37,370
in the CBD variety is that we were

671
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:39,920
growing you know you want those big

672
00:30:37,369 --> 00:30:42,529
beautiful flowers they're more compact

673
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:46,820
they were grown in a greenhouse but

674
00:30:42,529 --> 00:30:48,889
essentially what we're what we're trying

675
00:30:46,819 --> 00:30:53,269
to get at here is to draw on previous

676
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:56,840
work showing that nitrogen increased the

677
00:30:53,269 --> 00:30:58,789
total production of leaf biomass and

678
00:30:56,839 --> 00:31:01,579
that's important when looking at least

679
00:30:58,789 --> 00:31:04,970
analyses you know because you're

680
00:31:01,579 --> 00:31:07,759
comparing how much nitrogen is in that

681
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:09,589
leaf it's a larger leaf you know you can

682
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:12,619
potentially have a dilution effect and

683
00:31:09,589 --> 00:31:16,000
also that increased plant size could

684
00:31:12,619 --> 00:31:19,429
have resulted in a THC dilution effect

685
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:22,970
so if you have a larger bud but the same

686
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:25,130
amount of THC in it because most things

687
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:27,190
are calculated off of a percentage dry

688
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:31,760
weight you can have an artificially low

689
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:33,529
dilution effect however I am unsure I

690
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:36,529
can't recall off the top of my head

691
00:31:33,529 --> 00:31:40,519
which methodology I actually used to

692
00:31:36,529 --> 00:31:42,470
test THC in this study whether it was a

693
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:45,250
percentage dry weight or a percentage

694
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:47,390
concentration so on and so forth that

695
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:50,839
could be really interesting for people

696
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:54,590
in growing hemp that are looking to stay

697
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:57,589
below a given THC percentage in order to

698
00:31:54,589 --> 00:31:59,689
have a legal crop I'd be curious to see

699
00:31:57,589 --> 00:32:03,559
more research coming out on that around

700
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:05,330
nitrogen levels yeah I would - any

701
00:32:03,559 --> 00:32:07,940
research at this point is just gonna

702
00:32:05,329 --> 00:32:09,679
help that additive scientific effect so

703
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:13,130
that we can get a clearer picture for

704
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:14,420
what's going on ok so one thing one

705
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:15,530
other thing I want to ask you about was

706
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:17,180
at the end your introduction you

707
00:32:15,529 --> 00:32:18,799
mentioned that no visual guides of

708
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:21,019
nutrient deficiency in cannabis

709
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:22,909
supported with leaf tissue analysis and

710
00:32:21,019 --> 00:32:25,369
documenting a progression of symptoms

711
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:27,980
have been published so essentially what

712
00:32:25,369 --> 00:32:30,469
you're saying there is when I go online

713
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:32,539
on Google Images and type in you know

714
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:34,100
nitrogen deficiency cannabis or whatever

715
00:32:32,539 --> 00:32:36,920
a particular element I'm looking for

716
00:32:34,099 --> 00:32:39,439
there's no research that's been

717
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:41,180
published that actually correlates that

718
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,190
with a tissue test the leaf tissue

719
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:45,140
analysis to show that that truly is the

720
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:48,039
deficiency is that correct along with

721
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:52,130
symptom ology so different stages

722
00:32:48,039 --> 00:32:55,039
correct as far as I know and have seen

723
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:57,170
and was able to tease out in the work

724
00:32:55,039 --> 00:33:00,619
that I did there have been some leaf

725
00:32:57,170 --> 00:33:03,920
tissue analyses reported I believe the

726
00:33:00,619 --> 00:33:07,849
plant analysis handbook has some tissue

727
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:11,060
values for cannabis sativa but as far as

728
00:33:07,849 --> 00:33:12,319
correlating those visual symptoms with

729
00:33:11,059 --> 00:33:15,619
an actual

730
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:18,109
leaf tissue test and what I mean by

731
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:23,648
actually correlating I don't mean just

732
00:33:18,109 --> 00:33:26,000
providing low fertility when we withheld

733
00:33:23,648 --> 00:33:30,168
nitrogen from the plant the plant

734
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:33,288
received no nitrogen of any form so we

735
00:33:30,169 --> 00:33:36,200
can say with relative certainty that the

736
00:33:33,288 --> 00:33:39,950
symptom ology that we saw based on the

737
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:42,460
leaf tissue analysis is truly nitrogen

738
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:47,870
deficiency because the plant received

739
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:50,509
absolutely no nitrogen fertility let's

740
00:33:47,869 --> 00:33:51,258
dive right into nitrogen I'm not going

741
00:33:50,509 --> 00:33:53,000
to get into too much into your

742
00:33:51,259 --> 00:33:56,778
methodology it's all there in the paper

743
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:59,659
people want to read it it's it seems

744
00:33:56,778 --> 00:34:00,888
fairly straightforward to me let's just

745
00:33:59,659 --> 00:34:02,778
talk about what your findings were

746
00:34:00,888 --> 00:34:04,908
related in nitrogen so traditionally

747
00:34:02,778 --> 00:34:07,490
when you think of nitrogen deficiencies

748
00:34:04,909 --> 00:34:09,260
you think of a yellowing on the lower

749
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:11,599
leaves the plants putting more energy

750
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:14,599
into its upper leaves lighter greening

751
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:16,309
overall of the plants what I mean you

752
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:17,809
have some actual photos here so people

753
00:34:16,309 --> 00:34:19,909
can see initial intermediate and

754
00:34:17,809 --> 00:34:22,099
advanced stages of nitrogen deficiencies

755
00:34:19,909 --> 00:34:26,500
but can you talk all about about those

756
00:34:22,099 --> 00:34:30,349
findings relating in nitrogen yeah so

757
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:35,539
exploring nutrient deficiencies is kind

758
00:34:30,349 --> 00:34:40,309
of a fun I guess you could call it a bit

759
00:34:35,539 --> 00:34:43,759
of a puzzle certain elements within

760
00:34:40,309 --> 00:34:45,828
plants are mobile and what that means is

761
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:48,500
the plant has the ability to remove

762
00:34:45,829 --> 00:34:51,740
those from certain tissues and portions

763
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:54,710
and translocate them to other portions

764
00:34:51,739 --> 00:34:55,428
of the plant so for example nitrogen is

765
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:57,199
Noble

766
00:34:55,429 --> 00:35:00,440
so what that means is when the plant is

767
00:34:57,199 --> 00:35:02,719
nitrogen stressed it will draw nitrogen

768
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:05,750
from those lower leaves which is why we

769
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:07,848
kind of you know drew upon the fact that

770
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:10,789
the symptomology developed first on the

771
00:35:07,849 --> 00:35:13,190
lower portion of the plant and it will

772
00:35:10,789 --> 00:35:17,420
translate locate that to the you know

773
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:19,369
other portions of the plant that you

774
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:21,289
know need that nitrogen you know for

775
00:35:19,369 --> 00:35:24,380
example the meristematic region as it's

776
00:35:21,289 --> 00:35:26,090
developing new leaves and putting on new

777
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:29,360
shoots

778
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:32,059
and like you said typical symptom ology

779
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:34,849
of nitrogen deficiency is going to be

780
00:35:32,059 --> 00:35:38,179
like yellowing or paling specifically at

781
00:35:34,849 --> 00:35:41,029
the lower foliage other elements that we

782
00:35:38,179 --> 00:35:42,919
looked at you know are immobile which

783
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:47,540
means you're going to see symptom ology

784
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:50,659
on the newer leaves shoots near portions

785
00:35:47,539 --> 00:35:52,190
of the plant yeah that's a really good

786
00:35:50,659 --> 00:35:55,579
point regarding mobile and immobile

787
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:57,889
nutrients how related is that to the

788
00:35:55,579 --> 00:36:03,949
hydrology in terms of your watering

789
00:35:57,889 --> 00:36:08,989
habits nutrient mobility or nutrients

790
00:36:03,949 --> 00:36:11,899
that are mobile yeah so the the whole

791
00:36:08,989 --> 00:36:14,239
flow and dynamics and flux of nutrients

792
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:16,309
within the plant as is much more

793
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:18,739
complicated than we went into in this

794
00:36:16,309 --> 00:36:20,360
paper like I said we're trying to get

795
00:36:18,739 --> 00:36:24,349
some more foundational knowledge out

796
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:29,390
there but yes so for example some plants

797
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:31,579
are tran taken up by the plant through a

798
00:36:29,389 --> 00:36:35,719
process called mass flow and that's very

799
00:36:31,579 --> 00:36:38,989
much related to how much water

800
00:36:35,719 --> 00:36:42,709
essentially the roots can absorb into

801
00:36:38,989 --> 00:36:44,149
the plant and get those nutrients in and

802
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:47,240
then there's other ways that the plant

803
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:50,450
can obtain nutrients scavenge nutrients

804
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:53,329
etc so as far as through this study and

805
00:36:50,449 --> 00:36:55,699
all of the plants were on an automatic

806
00:36:53,329 --> 00:36:59,779
irrigation system and received the same

807
00:36:55,699 --> 00:37:02,809
amount of liquid at the same intervals

808
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:05,330
throughout the day the only thing that

809
00:37:02,809 --> 00:37:06,949
changed was which nutrients we were

810
00:37:05,329 --> 00:37:12,409
supplying to those plants in that

811
00:37:06,949 --> 00:37:13,639
solution okay and one of your one of the

812
00:37:12,409 --> 00:37:16,009
things I want to point out before we

813
00:37:13,639 --> 00:37:19,039
dive too far into any one element or

814
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:20,780
nutrient here is in a traditional

815
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:24,710
cannabis growing environment you're

816
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:27,620
gonna see multiple symptoms typically

817
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:29,750
it's not ever just a nitrogen deficiency

818
00:37:27,619 --> 00:37:31,489
or a phosphorus deficiency it's usually

819
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:33,199
related to your watering or your

820
00:37:31,489 --> 00:37:36,259
environment community your temperature

821
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:38,719
your lighting intensity insect pressure

822
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:41,000
there's so many variables so

823
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:43,250
I hope listeners will keep that in mind

824
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,769
when they're utilizing a guide like this

825
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:47,059
that it's not as simple as just picking

826
00:37:45,769 --> 00:37:49,070
out one of the photos and saying that

827
00:37:47,059 --> 00:37:51,199
looks the closest to like my plant and

828
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:53,210
so that's what's going on you have to

829
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:54,618
have a little more history into how that

830
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:57,740
plants being grown and what's going on

831
00:37:54,619 --> 00:38:00,920
in the room but just wanted to throw in

832
00:37:57,739 --> 00:38:03,289
that little caveat so sorry getting back

833
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:04,789
to it when you talk about nitrogen one

834
00:38:03,289 --> 00:38:06,650
of your findings was the plants growing

835
00:38:04,789 --> 00:38:08,869
in nitrate deficient conditions produce

836
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:11,240
50% less biomass when compared to the

837
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:12,710
control I thought this was an

838
00:38:11,239 --> 00:38:14,569
interesting finding I mean it seems

839
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:17,059
expected the plant doesn't have nitrate

840
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:18,740
it's not gonna be able to grow as as

841
00:38:17,059 --> 00:38:20,150
efficiently but you didn't find that

842
00:38:18,739 --> 00:38:23,899
across all of the different elements

843
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:25,250
that you were testing was so is there

844
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:29,450
anything in relation to nitrogen that

845
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:33,619
you want to touch on regarding that yeah

846
00:38:29,449 --> 00:38:36,289
so we have done numerous nutrient

847
00:38:33,619 --> 00:38:40,070
efficiency studies with multiple

848
00:38:36,289 --> 00:38:41,630
different crops and this trend of dry

849
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:44,930
weights being variable in their

850
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:47,599
statistical significance kind of holds

851
00:38:44,929 --> 00:38:52,338
true across most of those studies a lot

852
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:55,190
of it is just dependent upon the plants

853
00:38:52,338 --> 00:38:57,108
and how they have take nutrients how

854
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:59,088
they utilize those nutrients their

855
00:38:57,108 --> 00:39:01,848
growth habits you know you can imagine

856
00:38:59,088 --> 00:39:03,920
something that stays in a rosette form

857
00:39:01,849 --> 00:39:06,440
is going to have very different nutrient

858
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:09,409
needs and utilizations than something

859
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:12,349
that has a very upright and leggy growth

860
00:39:09,409 --> 00:39:15,170
habits but as far as nitrogen is

861
00:39:12,349 --> 00:39:17,599
concerned we expected to see a

862
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:19,338
statistical significance between no

863
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:22,369
nitrogen and nitrogen supplied

864
00:39:19,338 --> 00:39:25,070
treatments specifically because nitrogen

865
00:39:22,369 --> 00:39:30,410
is a macro nutrient and what that means

866
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:32,330
is the plant uses more nitrogen and

867
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:34,299
other macronutrients in greater

868
00:39:32,329 --> 00:39:37,190
quantities than say the micronutrients

869
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:40,070
both macro and micro are still needed by

870
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:43,880
the plants but as far as the amounts

871
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:46,730
that they need it means much much much

872
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:50,030
more nitrogen than safety even

873
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:51,769
phosphorus or potassium or calcium and

874
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:52,519
that's one of the reasons why there was

875
00:39:51,769 --> 00:39:54,610
such a

876
00:39:52,519 --> 00:39:58,639
strong statistically significant

877
00:39:54,610 --> 00:40:04,010
decrease in plant dry weight when

878
00:39:58,639 --> 00:40:06,799
compared to the control now in this test

879
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:08,330
you're you were just dealing with

880
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,640
vegetative plants correct so you never

881
00:40:08,329 --> 00:40:12,650
really looked at cannabinoid content THC

882
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:16,250
percentage any of those things is that

883
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:19,369
correct that is correct the current work

884
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:22,070
that we're doing we are looking at like

885
00:40:19,369 --> 00:40:25,099
I said the nutrient rates for all macro

886
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:28,430
and micro nutrients across the plants

887
00:40:25,099 --> 00:40:31,579
different life stages so the experiment

888
00:40:28,429 --> 00:40:35,029
that we are doing now we're looking at

889
00:40:31,579 --> 00:40:37,519
leaf tissue nutrient concentrations in

890
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:41,060
the vegetative state we then again

891
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:43,340
sample once we have turned off our

892
00:40:41,059 --> 00:40:47,329
lighting and initiated those shorter

893
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:49,220
days to start flowering and we harvest

894
00:40:47,329 --> 00:40:50,809
at pre flower which is typically a week

895
00:40:49,219 --> 00:40:54,049
to two weeks after we shut our lights

896
00:40:50,809 --> 00:40:56,449
off and then we're waiting until they go

897
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:59,210
into full flower maturity which we're

898
00:40:56,449 --> 00:41:00,949
targeting about eight weeks for full

899
00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:03,079
flower maturity and then were again

900
00:41:00,949 --> 00:41:07,039
sampling leaf tissue so we're getting

901
00:41:03,079 --> 00:41:10,730
this nice not only nutrient rate curve

902
00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:13,279
but also total plant life cycle and how

903
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:16,280
the nutrients are changing accumulating

904
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:19,490
moving within the plant this isn't an

905
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:24,080
uptake study or a translocation study

906
00:41:19,489 --> 00:41:25,969
it's a nutrient rate study over time but

907
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:27,349
like I said there's this additive effect

908
00:41:25,969 --> 00:41:30,549
so that's kind of the next step that

909
00:41:27,349 --> 00:41:32,179
we're going on to so on and so forth

910
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:36,050
yeah I think that'll be really

911
00:41:32,179 --> 00:41:37,869
interesting because it's it's fairly

912
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:41,150
easy I think to grow a healthy

913
00:41:37,869 --> 00:41:43,009
vegetative cannabis plant but as you get

914
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:49,610
further into flower as the plant starts

915
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:52,310
senesce income much much more apparent

916
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:54,620
so even though as we move through some

917
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:56,509
of these elements in your in your study

918
00:41:54,619 --> 00:41:59,239
here and you said you note that there

919
00:41:56,510 --> 00:42:02,080
isn't statistical significance in

920
00:41:59,239 --> 00:42:04,399
biomass I think as we move into flower

921
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:05,460
that'll become a lot more apparent in

922
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:09,119
terms of the

923
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:12,599
those deficiencies reflecting either a

924
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:16,108
loss of THC or cannabinoid percentages

925
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:19,830
or terpene values or even overall yield

926
00:42:16,108 --> 00:42:22,588
of flower biomass so I'm really excited

927
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:26,069
to see that work as you guys come out

928
00:42:22,588 --> 00:42:28,009
with it yeah and kind of going back to

929
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:31,109
what you were saying with the

930
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:35,820
statistically not the statistical non

931
00:42:31,108 --> 00:42:38,039
significance in the plant dry weights so

932
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:40,470
for example for phosphorus while we did

933
00:42:38,039 --> 00:42:43,710
not see a statistical significance in

934
00:42:40,469 --> 00:42:45,779
dry weight between the plants that did

935
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:49,019
not receive phosphorus versus the plants

936
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:51,089
that did you can look at the leaf tissue

937
00:42:49,019 --> 00:42:53,190
values and see that they were

938
00:42:51,088 --> 00:42:55,650
statistically significant and very

939
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:58,349
statistically significant actually so

940
00:42:55,650 --> 00:43:00,570
even though that phosphorus treatment

941
00:42:58,349 --> 00:43:03,210
may not have produced a smaller plant

942
00:43:00,570 --> 00:43:05,280
per per se it definitely had less

943
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:07,309
phosphorus which means that it will be

944
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:09,890
stressed and won't be as healthy and

945
00:43:07,309 --> 00:43:16,309
consequently could potentially produce

946
00:43:09,889 --> 00:43:18,118
you know a bud that would be suboptimal

947
00:43:16,309 --> 00:43:20,429
sure that makes sense

948
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:23,970
and you know I'm of the opinion that

949
00:43:20,429 --> 00:43:27,059
most most growers over apply phosphorus

950
00:43:23,969 --> 00:43:32,009
in flower I'd be curious are you going

951
00:43:27,059 --> 00:43:35,880
to look at what sort of what sufficient

952
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:38,849
sea levels are needed for phosphorus in

953
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:41,220
flower versus the overabundance that I

954
00:43:38,849 --> 00:43:43,588
think is applied throughout the cannabis

955
00:43:41,219 --> 00:43:49,739
industry in general when it comes to

956
00:43:43,588 --> 00:43:52,019
phosphorus yeah so one of the things

957
00:43:49,739 --> 00:43:55,079
that we'll be looking at is when we take

958
00:43:52,019 --> 00:43:57,599
that final leaf tissue harvest so we're

959
00:43:55,079 --> 00:43:59,819
going to be looking at okay at the end

960
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:03,059
of the plant's life how much phosphorus

961
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:04,859
did it accumulate over these different

962
00:44:03,059 --> 00:44:08,608
rates but then we will also be looking

963
00:44:04,858 --> 00:44:12,150
at cannabinoids cannabinoids however you

964
00:44:08,608 --> 00:44:17,069
want to say it and how that can

965
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:19,450
potentially relate back to the different

966
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:22,870
rates that were applying so

967
00:44:19,449 --> 00:44:25,509
for example in our phosphorus provided

968
00:44:22,869 --> 00:44:31,630
at let's say hypothetically ten parts

969
00:44:25,510 --> 00:44:34,420
per million what would that bud total

970
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:39,760
dry mass be but then what would also be

971
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:43,570
the you know level of THC or CBD CBG in

972
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:45,040
that flower very cool I can't wait to

973
00:44:43,570 --> 00:44:48,010
see that research that's I think really

974
00:44:45,039 --> 00:44:50,650
exciting I would love to have you back

975
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:52,140
on once you have you know gotten a

976
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:54,130
little further along and published that

977
00:44:52,139 --> 00:44:58,690
yeah we'd love to

978
00:44:54,130 --> 00:45:00,099
we'd love to do that cool so let's let's

979
00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:01,539
move on to calcium it looks like that's

980
00:45:00,099 --> 00:45:03,940
the next nutrient that you talked about

981
00:45:01,539 --> 00:45:07,269
here I did notice that you put in

982
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:10,079
dolomite lime into your substrate to get

983
00:45:07,269 --> 00:45:12,639
some calcium and magnesium in there

984
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:13,960
Keith can you touch on that and then

985
00:45:12,639 --> 00:45:21,089
also what your findings were with

986
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:24,039
calcium yeah absolutely so for the

987
00:45:21,090 --> 00:45:26,260
rooting substrate that we use because

988
00:45:24,039 --> 00:45:28,929
these were vegetative cuttings yes some

989
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:31,680
of that did have delimited climb amended

990
00:45:28,929 --> 00:45:34,289
in it but those levels would be

991
00:45:31,679 --> 00:45:37,000
negligible on the scale that we're

992
00:45:34,289 --> 00:45:39,489
looking at especially as the plants

993
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,650
continue to grow and there's you know

994
00:45:39,489 --> 00:45:44,529
more biomass and consequently less

995
00:45:41,650 --> 00:45:46,840
calcium and you can see that in the

996
00:45:44,530 --> 00:45:48,730
statistically significant results from

997
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:52,990
the leaf tissue concentration that we

998
00:45:48,730 --> 00:45:56,199
saw but as far as symptomology for

999
00:45:52,989 --> 00:45:58,359
calcium goes calcium is an immobile

1000
00:45:56,199 --> 00:46:00,609
element so when you're looking to see

1001
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:02,050
calcium stress or deficiency on your

1002
00:46:00,610 --> 00:46:04,050
plants you're going to be looking at the

1003
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:06,190
growing tips the newly expanded leaves

1004
00:46:04,050 --> 00:46:09,400
the portions of the plants that are

1005
00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:11,470
actively growing and expanding so

1006
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:14,380
calcium the plant isn't able to

1007
00:46:11,469 --> 00:46:16,209
requisition any calcium reserves from

1008
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:17,800
old cells or old plant parts and

1009
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:20,970
translocated so that's why you're

1010
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:23,920
looking at these new portions and

1011
00:46:20,969 --> 00:46:29,519
another thing with calcium is that it's

1012
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:33,338
involved in cell wall stability and

1013
00:46:29,519 --> 00:46:35,349
basically what happens when a plant

1014
00:46:33,338 --> 00:46:38,858
through a calcium deficiency is it

1015
00:46:35,349 --> 00:46:42,880
cannot adequately develop so you'll see

1016
00:46:38,858 --> 00:46:44,978
this severe distortion and stunting that

1017
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:48,219
we saw and you can see in the photos as

1018
00:46:44,978 --> 00:46:50,169
they progress and that's one of the

1019
00:46:48,219 --> 00:46:51,579
reasons that we were able to see such

1020
00:46:50,170 --> 00:46:54,759
beautiful

1021
00:46:51,579 --> 00:46:56,440
I say beautiful but if you're seeing the

1022
00:46:54,759 --> 00:47:00,039
symptom ology it's not beautiful when it

1023
00:46:56,440 --> 00:47:02,979
grew up but beautiful symptomology that

1024
00:47:00,039 --> 00:47:06,369
we induced it's quite dramatic it's it's

1025
00:47:02,978 --> 00:47:07,778
very apparent which i think is is what

1026
00:47:06,369 --> 00:47:09,099
you're referring to there and it is

1027
00:47:07,778 --> 00:47:12,728
great to see and you can't see it it

1028
00:47:09,099 --> 00:47:15,479
just it almost looks like it had a lot

1029
00:47:12,728 --> 00:47:18,608
of light stress I think in a lot of ways

1030
00:47:15,478 --> 00:47:19,868
it's it's I was quite shocked with just

1031
00:47:18,608 --> 00:47:22,150
how dramatic it is because it's funny

1032
00:47:19,869 --> 00:47:24,940
because in the in the cannabis industry

1033
00:47:22,150 --> 00:47:28,358
there's sort of this old mantra that if

1034
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:30,429
your plant looks at all sick or

1035
00:47:28,358 --> 00:47:32,139
deficient you just apply Cal meg and

1036
00:47:30,429 --> 00:47:33,429
it's kind of become a running joke in

1037
00:47:32,139 --> 00:47:35,379
the cannabis industry I've just you know

1038
00:47:33,429 --> 00:47:39,068
put more Cal mag on that product but in

1039
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:40,930
reality I think it's rare we see these

1040
00:47:39,068 --> 00:47:43,900
sorts of calcium deficiencies that they

1041
00:47:40,929 --> 00:47:45,998
do occur at least I don't see them as

1042
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:48,818
much with the growers that I work with I

1043
00:47:45,998 --> 00:47:52,748
tend to see more nitrogen or potassium

1044
00:47:48,818 --> 00:47:54,579
deficiencies but yeah I really like

1045
00:47:52,748 --> 00:47:57,159
seeing those photos so that was really

1046
00:47:54,579 --> 00:47:58,479
great to see was there anything else

1047
00:47:57,159 --> 00:48:00,190
about calcium that you want to add I

1048
00:47:58,478 --> 00:48:02,259
love that you're kind of describing a

1049
00:48:00,190 --> 00:48:03,818
little bit of how these nutrients work

1050
00:48:02,259 --> 00:48:08,259
in a plant because I think that's really

1051
00:48:03,818 --> 00:48:09,548
important so I appreciate that too what

1052
00:48:08,259 --> 00:48:10,748
if you're okay with it let's move on to

1053
00:48:09,548 --> 00:48:14,619
sulfur and you can talk a little about

1054
00:48:10,748 --> 00:48:17,498
that too yeah I'd like to touch on one

1055
00:48:14,619 --> 00:48:19,690
more thing on calcium real quick okay so

1056
00:48:17,498 --> 00:48:21,399
calcium and boron will have very silver

1057
00:48:19,690 --> 00:48:25,028
similar symptom ology and they're both

1058
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:27,719
in mobile elements but one of the

1059
00:48:25,028 --> 00:48:32,199
reasons and we have completed the

1060
00:48:27,719 --> 00:48:34,690
micronutrients experiment run for that

1061
00:48:32,199 --> 00:48:36,338
nutrient rates by lifecycle portion so I

1062
00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:39,489
can talk a little bit about some of the

1063
00:48:36,338 --> 00:48:41,288
symptomology and results not true

1064
00:48:39,489 --> 00:48:45,749
results yet we haven't run statistics on

1065
00:48:41,289 --> 00:48:47,140
the full study but because cannabis

1066
00:48:45,748 --> 00:48:49,419
wants it and

1067
00:48:47,139 --> 00:48:51,900
it's its reproductive phase that growing

1068
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:54,130
tip will become the flowering portion

1069
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:56,889
calcium and boron are extremely

1070
00:48:54,130 --> 00:49:01,599
important in that development because

1071
00:48:56,889 --> 00:49:03,219
you know when they finally are initiate

1072
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:05,440
the reproductive cycle and start

1073
00:49:03,219 --> 00:49:08,108
producing that flower bud it's going to

1074
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:10,690
be at that growing tip that you see

1075
00:49:08,108 --> 00:49:13,598
across the plant so if you do have

1076
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:15,759
calcium or boron deficiencies you will

1077
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:17,559
not have a properly developing flower

1078
00:49:15,759 --> 00:49:21,248
bud because you won't have a properly

1079
00:49:17,559 --> 00:49:24,249
developing an expanding growing region

1080
00:49:21,248 --> 00:49:28,088
and so you know we saw that with our

1081
00:49:24,248 --> 00:49:34,028
boron plants you know we had almost no

1082
00:49:28,088 --> 00:49:36,130
flowers produced on our boron 0r8 once

1083
00:49:34,028 --> 00:49:39,009
we initiated flowering just because

1084
00:49:36,130 --> 00:49:41,460
there the plant was physiologically

1085
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:44,199
incapable of expanding and growing

1086
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:46,900
because it did not have the structural

1087
00:49:44,199 --> 00:49:51,009
components needed to build those cells

1088
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:52,960
and expand those cells that's really

1089
00:49:51,009 --> 00:49:56,528
interesting and people can go and view

1090
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:59,528
these photos to see what what Paul is

1091
00:49:56,528 --> 00:50:01,179
describing here on on the paper itself

1092
00:49:59,528 --> 00:50:03,818
there's some great photos associated

1093
00:50:01,179 --> 00:50:06,998
with every one of these elements yeah so

1094
00:50:03,818 --> 00:50:08,889
you wanted to move on to sulphur next is

1095
00:50:06,998 --> 00:50:10,389
that correct yeah we'll just keep

1096
00:50:08,889 --> 00:50:11,699
working our way through I think this is

1097
00:50:10,389 --> 00:50:16,449
great thank you

1098
00:50:11,699 --> 00:50:21,879
wonderful yeah so for sulphur again it

1099
00:50:16,449 --> 00:50:24,759
was one of those elements where we did

1100
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:28,289
not see a statistically significant

1101
00:50:24,759 --> 00:50:30,789
difference in the dry weight between the

1102
00:50:28,289 --> 00:50:33,759
plants that did not receive any sulphur

1103
00:50:30,789 --> 00:50:34,960
versus the control however when you

1104
00:50:33,759 --> 00:50:38,099
actually look at the leaf tissue

1105
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:41,559
concentration it was statistically

1106
00:50:38,099 --> 00:50:44,650
significant so the plants that received

1107
00:50:41,559 --> 00:50:48,180
no sulphur had much much lower leaf

1108
00:50:44,650 --> 00:50:53,019
tissue concentrations than plants that

1109
00:50:48,179 --> 00:50:56,018
received an adequate level of sulfur

1110
00:50:53,018 --> 00:50:58,498
fertility and again I want to kind of go

1111
00:50:56,018 --> 00:51:00,848
back to what you said a bit earlier on

1112
00:50:58,498 --> 00:51:04,238
you know making sure that you take

1113
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:07,298
holistic approach to diagnostics in your

1114
00:51:04,239 --> 00:51:10,749
plants you know I that was great that he

1115
00:51:07,298 --> 00:51:13,659
said that leaf tissue analysis is just

1116
00:51:10,748 --> 00:51:15,969
one way of trying to tease out problems

1117
00:51:13,659 --> 00:51:17,409
that you may experience you know it's

1118
00:51:15,969 --> 00:51:18,818
like you said it's this holistic

1119
00:51:17,409 --> 00:51:21,728
approach that you have to take it could

1120
00:51:18,818 --> 00:51:24,548
be another abiotic stress you know it

1121
00:51:21,728 --> 00:51:28,118
could be ozone damage it could be water

1122
00:51:24,548 --> 00:51:30,699
stress you know so taking those leaf

1123
00:51:28,119 --> 00:51:32,798
tissue concentrations from your plant

1124
00:51:30,699 --> 00:51:36,009
actually going in taking the leaf tissue

1125
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:38,170
samples sending it off to a lab ensuring

1126
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:40,298
that you can do that and that the lab is

1127
00:51:38,170 --> 00:51:42,068
licensed and that the laws and

1128
00:51:40,298 --> 00:51:44,949
legalities in your state allow you to do

1129
00:51:42,068 --> 00:51:47,768
that to gain this information will be

1130
00:51:44,949 --> 00:51:50,259
extremely valuable if you think you have

1131
00:51:47,768 --> 00:51:53,919
a nutrient deficiency you always want to

1132
00:51:50,259 --> 00:51:56,579
go that extra step if possible and check

1133
00:51:53,920 --> 00:52:02,759
to ensure that what you're seeing

1134
00:51:56,579 --> 00:52:05,969
visually is also reflected in the plant

1135
00:52:02,759 --> 00:52:08,498
yeah that's an interesting topic because

1136
00:52:05,969 --> 00:52:11,619
because cannabis is federally illegal we

1137
00:52:08,498 --> 00:52:13,058
cannot ship any leaf samples even if

1138
00:52:11,619 --> 00:52:16,960
there have a vegetative plant with zero

1139
00:52:13,059 --> 00:52:18,400
THC content in the mail so most cannabis

1140
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:21,489
facilities are very limited in their

1141
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:25,298
ability to do tissue testing so a lot of

1142
00:52:21,489 --> 00:52:26,978
what we do is sow testing because we're

1143
00:52:25,298 --> 00:52:31,268
primarily working with organic soil

1144
00:52:26,978 --> 00:52:35,018
growers where we where we have certain

1145
00:52:31,268 --> 00:52:36,939
levels of mineral content in every soil

1146
00:52:35,018 --> 00:52:38,258
mix that we're working with in native

1147
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:39,849
soil and then it's just a matter of

1148
00:52:38,259 --> 00:52:43,228
trying to balance those based off of

1149
00:52:39,849 --> 00:52:45,818
like a male ik3 test which is not ideal

1150
00:52:43,228 --> 00:52:49,568
I'm fully aware of that but it's one of

1151
00:52:45,818 --> 00:52:51,518
the limit limitations within the

1152
00:52:49,568 --> 00:52:53,679
cannabis research at least from a

1153
00:52:51,518 --> 00:52:56,588
facility perspective because we are

1154
00:52:53,679 --> 00:52:59,949
limited not only just in the ability to

1155
00:52:56,588 --> 00:53:01,298
mail leaf samples to reach a lab to even

1156
00:52:59,949 --> 00:53:02,919
find a lab that's willing to look at a

1157
00:53:01,298 --> 00:53:04,869
cannabis sample and then also just the

1158
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:08,369
cost associated with testing for

1159
00:53:04,869 --> 00:53:11,170
businesses is is really tough so it's

1160
00:53:08,369 --> 00:53:14,380
great that the university is doing work

1161
00:53:11,170 --> 00:53:16,389
like this to at least allow

1162
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:19,480
growers to have access to some of this

1163
00:53:16,389 --> 00:53:23,109
information yeah that's that's a great

1164
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:25,710
insight and again you know we're we're

1165
00:53:23,110 --> 00:53:28,780
learning as much as we possibly can so

1166
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:31,030
honestly the exchanges that we get with

1167
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:32,800
growers and the kind of challenges that

1168
00:53:31,030 --> 00:53:35,560
they're experiencing it only helps us do

1169
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:38,800
better research so who knows maybe down

1170
00:53:35,559 --> 00:53:40,570
the road we're going to look at possibly

1171
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:42,789
correlating some of you know the

1172
00:53:40,570 --> 00:53:45,070
nutrient work that we're doing to you

1173
00:53:42,789 --> 00:53:47,469
know some of those soil tests I know

1174
00:53:45,070 --> 00:53:49,809
that there's researchers out there who

1175
00:53:47,469 --> 00:53:53,439
do a lot of work with that and I think

1176
00:53:49,809 --> 00:53:56,980
they jump at the opportunity to do some

1177
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:58,210
work like that if it's needed yeah

1178
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:59,710
that'd be great I mean I'd love to see

1179
00:53:58,210 --> 00:54:01,510
more correlation there between like the

1180
00:53:59,710 --> 00:54:03,909
may like three and saturated pace tests

1181
00:54:01,510 --> 00:54:08,410
with these tissue tests so we have a

1182
00:54:03,909 --> 00:54:10,569
better idea of how we're of nutrient

1183
00:54:08,409 --> 00:54:12,009
availability in these soils because the

1184
00:54:10,570 --> 00:54:13,450
other challenge there too is how much of

1185
00:54:12,010 --> 00:54:15,940
those those nutrients are really

1186
00:54:13,449 --> 00:54:18,009
available to a plant and and how well is

1187
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:19,059
the biology it's cycling those nutrients

1188
00:54:18,010 --> 00:54:20,860
so if we're talking about organic

1189
00:54:19,059 --> 00:54:24,699
systems there's so many variables

1190
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:26,410
involved and it gets quite complex and I

1191
00:54:24,699 --> 00:54:30,339
think it's gonna be a long time before

1192
00:54:26,409 --> 00:54:33,099
we have all those answers but by using

1193
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:34,450
you know chemical nutrients or mineral

1194
00:54:33,099 --> 00:54:36,989
salts like you guys are you're really

1195
00:54:34,449 --> 00:54:39,639
able to isolate out these various

1196
00:54:36,989 --> 00:54:41,469
minerals or nutrients which really makes

1197
00:54:39,639 --> 00:54:43,659
a difference in seeing these these

1198
00:54:41,469 --> 00:54:46,750
symptoms so that we can we can still

1199
00:54:43,659 --> 00:54:49,299
apply some of this knowledge towards you

1200
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:54,159
know are more complex organic soil

1201
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:56,320
systems yeah the one thing I will say

1202
00:54:54,159 --> 00:54:58,029
with sulfur that I see is I tend to see

1203
00:54:56,320 --> 00:55:00,490
it in very high levels in organic soils

1204
00:54:58,030 --> 00:55:03,100
primarily because people either applying

1205
00:55:00,489 --> 00:55:05,769
sulfates or gypsum as a way of

1206
00:55:03,099 --> 00:55:09,819
mitigating the alkalinity of a lot of

1207
00:55:05,769 --> 00:55:11,590
the cations in in soils so I tend to see

1208
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:14,019
like excessively high sulfur levels

1209
00:55:11,590 --> 00:55:15,340
however from all the research I found

1210
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:18,940
it's very hard to reach sulfur

1211
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:21,100
toxicities in soils or more specifically

1212
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:23,349
in cannabis plants to where I haven't

1213
00:55:21,099 --> 00:55:26,440
really seen it be a big issue it's been

1214
00:55:23,349 --> 00:55:29,230
one of the best tools for lowering pH

1215
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:30,820
that I've found in soils is anything you

1216
00:55:29,230 --> 00:55:36,190
want to add you mean you in touch on

1217
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:42,690
regarding that comment yeah it's very

1218
00:55:36,190 --> 00:55:45,490
difficult to produce a sulphur toxicity

1219
00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:49,380
and without going too much into the

1220
00:55:45,489 --> 00:55:53,549
details of physiology of that

1221
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:56,829
essentially the plant is very good at

1222
00:55:53,550 --> 00:56:00,010
requisitioning utilizing or excluding

1223
00:55:56,829 --> 00:56:03,400
sulphur within the soil one thing that

1224
00:56:00,010 --> 00:56:05,650
you can see and some things that have

1225
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:07,450
come out of literature is that elevated

1226
00:56:05,650 --> 00:56:10,480
sulphur level is just like any other

1227
00:56:07,449 --> 00:56:13,589
element being elevated above others in

1228
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:16,240
the soil profile can potentially impact

1229
00:56:13,590 --> 00:56:20,170
and I will call it qualify that by

1230
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:22,779
saying can potentially impact the

1231
00:56:20,170 --> 00:56:24,639
microbial community and especially in

1232
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:28,540
say an organic system like what you're

1233
00:56:24,639 --> 00:56:31,690
working with you know looking at how

1234
00:56:28,539 --> 00:56:33,279
those microbes can take those nutrients

1235
00:56:31,690 --> 00:56:36,039
and turn them into you know a

1236
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:38,200
mineralized four form that is plants

1237
00:56:36,039 --> 00:56:40,599
available you know that relationship

1238
00:56:38,199 --> 00:56:43,179
between the organic matter the microbes

1239
00:56:40,599 --> 00:56:45,460
and then the production of those mineral

1240
00:56:43,179 --> 00:56:49,259
plant available forms is a very

1241
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:52,720
important Network and web to be

1242
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:55,859
maintaining and monitoring so down the

1243
00:56:52,719 --> 00:56:59,319
road maybe there could be more work done

1244
00:56:55,858 --> 00:57:02,500
specifically with regard to microbes and

1245
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:06,160
say elevated sulfur levels and nutrient

1246
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:07,510
cycling and organic systems yeah it was

1247
00:57:06,159 --> 00:57:10,179
really what I would like to see

1248
00:57:07,510 --> 00:57:12,880
regarding sulfur is information on how

1249
00:57:10,179 --> 00:57:16,358
sulfur impacts of biology cuz when we

1250
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:17,710
talk about sulfur it comes in a lot of

1251
00:57:16,358 --> 00:57:19,719
different forms so when we talk about a

1252
00:57:17,710 --> 00:57:22,630
sulfate form or it's you know we talked

1253
00:57:19,719 --> 00:57:25,209
about potassium sulfate calcium sulfate

1254
00:57:22,630 --> 00:57:28,570
in the case of gypsum it appears to have

1255
00:57:25,210 --> 00:57:30,699
in this is anecdotal very little minor

1256
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:32,769
impact on overall soil biology and

1257
00:57:30,699 --> 00:57:34,839
nutrient cycling but I've heard when

1258
00:57:32,769 --> 00:57:37,719
using agricultural so for which is

1259
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:39,880
associated with lowering pH

1260
00:57:37,719 --> 00:57:42,098
it can have a more dramatic input impact

1261
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:44,079
on soil biology but I haven't I haven't

1262
00:57:42,099 --> 00:57:46,890
seen enough research and I haven't seen

1263
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:49,598
enough data to really show how much

1264
00:57:46,889 --> 00:57:53,858
sulfur would need to be added to lower a

1265
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:56,530
pH level this much in a given volume of

1266
00:57:53,858 --> 00:57:58,029
soil and how that impacts so about those

1267
00:57:56,530 --> 00:57:59,740
are things that I would love answers to

1268
00:57:58,030 --> 00:58:00,910
down the road or if that research exists

1269
00:57:59,739 --> 00:58:04,358
someone send it to me because I haven't

1270
00:58:00,909 --> 00:58:06,670
seen it yeah some research like that one

1271
00:58:04,358 --> 00:58:09,840
would be fantastic especially with

1272
00:58:06,670 --> 00:58:12,789
regards to organic forms of sulfur

1273
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:17,800
there's like you said there's definitely

1274
00:58:12,789 --> 00:58:20,050
very much need for more information to

1275
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:24,490
help perpetuate that adequate of

1276
00:58:20,050 --> 00:58:26,109
scientific process okay but let's go

1277
00:58:24,489 --> 00:58:28,539
back and and why don't you tell us a

1278
00:58:26,108 --> 00:58:32,348
little bit more about magnesium I know I

1279
00:58:28,539 --> 00:58:35,858
got off topic there for a second yes so

1280
00:58:32,349 --> 00:58:40,260
magnesium deficiency magnesium is

1281
00:58:35,858 --> 00:58:44,409
involved with chlorophyll and

1282
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:46,359
essentially what a plant will when a

1283
00:58:44,409 --> 00:58:48,069
plant experiences magnesium deficiency

1284
00:58:46,358 --> 00:58:51,088
chlorophyll essentially doesn't function

1285
00:58:48,070 --> 00:58:54,250
in the way that it's supposed to and

1286
00:58:51,088 --> 00:58:56,139
what that means for the plant is if you

1287
00:58:54,250 --> 00:58:58,059
have a magnesium deficiency the

1288
00:58:56,139 --> 00:59:01,329
photosynthetic activity of the plant

1289
00:58:58,059 --> 00:59:04,690
could be much lower and that will impact

1290
00:59:01,329 --> 00:59:07,838
the resources and photosynthate that the

1291
00:59:04,690 --> 00:59:11,530
plant has and is able to then throw at

1292
00:59:07,838 --> 00:59:14,170
the developing bud and other developing

1293
00:59:11,530 --> 00:59:17,190
portions of the plant so if you think

1294
00:59:14,170 --> 00:59:20,108
about it and a typical life cycle you

1295
00:59:17,190 --> 00:59:23,139
know every organism wants to reproduce

1296
00:59:20,108 --> 00:59:27,219
and especially in plants as you touched

1297
00:59:23,139 --> 00:59:29,848
on a lot of times with the reproductive

1298
00:59:27,219 --> 00:59:33,579
stage of the plant you'll experience

1299
00:59:29,849 --> 00:59:34,960
much more pronounced stressors and that

1300
00:59:33,579 --> 00:59:36,579
will be when you start seeing those

1301
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:38,980
symptom ologies for nutrient

1302
00:59:36,579 --> 00:59:40,509
deficiencies or you know other stresses

1303
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:42,579
that the plant may be experiencing

1304
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:45,550
because it's dumping so many of those

1305
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:48,549
resources into that developing flower

1306
00:59:45,550 --> 00:59:52,500
bud with the end goal of trying to

1307
00:59:48,550 --> 00:59:58,150
reproduce and so especially my

1308
00:59:52,500 --> 01:00:01,300
magnesium you can potentially have huge

1309
00:59:58,150 --> 01:00:03,730
impacts to your yield and again like I

1310
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:06,660
said we have not explored the full rates

1311
01:00:03,730 --> 01:00:12,010
and lifecycle analysis yet of this

1312
01:00:06,659 --> 01:00:13,839
element throughout the plant but it's

1313
01:00:12,010 --> 01:00:17,110
one of those that you want to keep a

1314
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:18,160
specific eye on given its importance to

1315
01:00:17,110 --> 01:00:22,120
plant health overall

1316
01:00:18,159 --> 01:00:25,839
and then also touching on the the

1317
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:29,139
symptomology by location on the leaf and

1318
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:31,269
how it develops and progresses like you

1319
01:00:29,139 --> 01:00:33,789
said they're very similar magnesium and

1320
01:00:31,269 --> 01:00:37,119
potassium deficiency symptoms are very

1321
01:00:33,789 --> 01:00:39,909
similar and so understanding that leaf

1322
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:42,909
anatomy and how it progresses you know

1323
01:00:39,909 --> 01:00:45,699
is important in the visual diagnostic

1324
01:00:42,909 --> 01:00:50,099
checklist that you kind of go through

1325
01:00:45,699 --> 01:00:53,199
and obviously in an ideal world we would

1326
01:00:50,099 --> 01:00:56,699
identify my initiating deficiency early

1327
01:00:53,199 --> 01:00:59,529
before it gets to these advanced stages

1328
01:00:56,699 --> 01:01:02,079
so that you know we don't have to wait

1329
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:04,210
until it we see advanced entomology to

1330
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:08,019
determine you know magnesium versus

1331
01:01:04,210 --> 01:01:09,550
potassium deficiency yeah now I'm

1332
01:01:08,019 --> 01:01:12,599
excited to talk about potassium because

1333
01:01:09,550 --> 01:01:14,830
I think potassium is one of the most

1334
01:01:12,599 --> 01:01:18,940
important elements when we're talking

1335
01:01:14,829 --> 01:01:21,940
about cannabis and I don't have the data

1336
01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:24,070
to support this yet at least I mean I

1337
01:01:21,940 --> 01:01:26,740
have you know hundreds of soil tests

1338
01:01:24,070 --> 01:01:29,320
I've looked at relat relat into overall

1339
01:01:26,739 --> 01:01:32,469
plant growth but they're not I haven't

1340
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:35,610
had any plant tissue analysis but the

1341
01:01:32,469 --> 01:01:40,559
trend that I think I'm seeing is that

1342
01:01:35,610 --> 01:01:43,780
potassium deficiencies occur at a much

1343
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:46,690
higher rate in cannabis as in they need

1344
01:01:43,780 --> 01:01:50,230
more potassium than most agricultural

1345
01:01:46,690 --> 01:01:55,500
crops and I think potassium has a high

1346
01:01:50,230 --> 01:01:59,340
correlation with bud density and overall

1347
01:01:55,500 --> 01:02:02,909
weight so essentially talking yield

1348
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:04,820
based on the soil tests that I see

1349
01:02:02,909 --> 01:02:06,739
correlating with

1350
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:09,559
plants the plants that appear to be our

1351
01:02:06,739 --> 01:02:12,229
soils that appear to be K deficient or

1352
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:14,869
even just case sufficient like barely

1353
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:21,250
sufficient tend to produce lower yield

1354
01:02:14,869 --> 01:02:23,659
and lower wait yeah lower weight and

1355
01:02:21,250 --> 01:02:25,820
overall lower yield and lower bud

1356
01:02:23,659 --> 01:02:28,639
density than these then plants that have

1357
01:02:25,820 --> 01:02:31,070
what most we consider an excess of

1358
01:02:28,639 --> 01:02:33,889
potassium but I'd be curious to have you

1359
01:02:31,070 --> 01:02:35,480
talk on it and also talk about what your

1360
01:02:33,889 --> 01:02:41,210
findings were with potassium in this

1361
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:44,480
particular paper yeah so the interesting

1362
01:02:41,210 --> 01:02:47,420
thing about potassium especially with

1363
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:50,900
regards to on say a soil profile as

1364
01:02:47,420 --> 01:02:52,670
opposed to some of the you know soluble

1365
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:57,829
fertilizers that we were using here is

1366
01:02:52,670 --> 01:03:01,930
it's a mono valent ion which means it's

1367
01:02:57,829 --> 01:03:04,670
charge is it essentially has a charged

1368
01:03:01,929 --> 01:03:08,899
positive charge a singular positive

1369
01:03:04,670 --> 01:03:10,970
charge so typically what happens say you

1370
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:14,119
have a heavy rain event those mono

1371
01:03:10,969 --> 01:03:16,939
valent ions will be leached through the

1372
01:03:14,119 --> 01:03:20,569
soil profile they're readily then say

1373
01:03:16,940 --> 01:03:24,760
you're diving lint and so that means

1374
01:03:20,570 --> 01:03:28,010
that potassium can move into a plant

1375
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:30,380
relatively easily but it also moves

1376
01:03:28,010 --> 01:03:34,430
through the soil profile relatively

1377
01:03:30,380 --> 01:03:37,579
easily as well but that's kind of a side

1378
01:03:34,429 --> 01:03:40,849
note and as far as the research findings

1379
01:03:37,579 --> 01:03:43,099
that we found we also found that you

1380
01:03:40,849 --> 01:03:48,500
know limiting potassium had a huge

1381
01:03:43,099 --> 01:03:50,539
impact on the the obviously it had an

1382
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:52,730
impact on how much potassium was update

1383
01:03:50,539 --> 01:03:54,710
was taken into the plant because there

1384
01:03:52,730 --> 01:03:57,230
was none supplied but once it was

1385
01:03:54,710 --> 01:04:03,369
supplied the potassium levels were quite

1386
01:03:57,230 --> 01:04:08,809
high in the plant and we referenced our

1387
01:04:03,369 --> 01:04:13,190
survey values in the paper as well and

1388
01:04:08,809 --> 01:04:15,980
those were within the reference values

1389
01:04:13,190 --> 01:04:17,510
that we had in our initial study but I

1390
01:04:15,980 --> 01:04:19,010
would agree with you that more work

1391
01:04:17,510 --> 01:04:22,190
definitely needs to be done in pitaya

1392
01:04:19,010 --> 01:04:25,700
Sam as far as its role in the

1393
01:04:22,190 --> 01:04:30,260
developments and etc as you touched upon

1394
01:04:25,699 --> 01:04:33,019
I am uncomfortable addressing that given

1395
01:04:30,260 --> 01:04:36,290
you know we have not yet explored the

1396
01:04:33,019 --> 01:04:39,050
potassium rates and the lifecycle once

1397
01:04:36,289 --> 01:04:42,259
we do that's definitely something that I

1398
01:04:39,050 --> 01:04:44,150
will be specifically looking for and

1399
01:04:42,260 --> 01:04:47,180
comparing in our study so that's

1400
01:04:44,150 --> 01:04:49,400
extremely helpful I can't wait to see

1401
01:04:47,179 --> 01:04:50,659
that because what I so I'll get from a

1402
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:52,519
grower a male like three tests for

1403
01:04:50,659 --> 01:04:54,379
example at the beginning of the grow

1404
01:04:52,519 --> 01:04:58,070
cycle and then one at the end and what I

1405
01:04:54,380 --> 01:04:59,990
find is in terms of how far the

1406
01:04:58,070 --> 01:05:02,809
nutrients have dropped in the soil

1407
01:04:59,989 --> 01:05:06,349
you know nitrogen and potassium are the

1408
01:05:02,809 --> 01:05:08,630
two that see that typically appear to

1409
01:05:06,349 --> 01:05:10,549
drop the most and as you mentioned they

1410
01:05:08,630 --> 01:05:12,230
are very mobile they could be being

1411
01:05:10,550 --> 01:05:13,820
leached out of the soil from a flooding

1412
01:05:12,230 --> 01:05:16,789
event but a lot of the guys that were

1413
01:05:13,820 --> 01:05:19,550
working with - are using blue mats which

1414
01:05:16,789 --> 01:05:22,400
are essentially an automated watering

1415
01:05:19,550 --> 01:05:24,530
system that only waters as that soil

1416
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:27,200
dries out so it's it's controlled

1417
01:05:24,530 --> 01:05:31,400
through osmotic pressure by the soil

1418
01:05:27,199 --> 01:05:34,189
itself and so we tend to not have a lot

1419
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:37,099
of leaching going on through that bed so

1420
01:05:34,190 --> 01:05:38,869
in theory if nothing's leaching out the

1421
01:05:37,099 --> 01:05:40,309
bottom of the bed then that that

1422
01:05:38,869 --> 01:05:42,109
potassium is being taken up into the

1423
01:05:40,309 --> 01:05:45,259
plant and as we see potassium levels

1424
01:05:42,110 --> 01:05:49,490
drop to let's say around five percent or

1425
01:05:45,260 --> 01:05:53,360
lower of the total cation exchange CC of

1426
01:05:49,489 --> 01:05:55,429
the death of total the total plant or

1427
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:58,550
sorry total of what's available in the

1428
01:05:55,429 --> 01:06:00,769
soil I start to see smaller buds lower

1429
01:05:58,550 --> 01:06:02,360
yield that sort of thing so I'd love to

1430
01:06:00,769 --> 01:06:04,639
see research on that and see what really

1431
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:07,760
is going on there in the leaf tissue

1432
01:06:04,639 --> 01:06:09,980
itself that's actually really

1433
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:12,050
interesting I have to keep that in mind

1434
01:06:09,980 --> 01:06:13,730
when looking at the study when we run

1435
01:06:12,050 --> 01:06:15,530
the micronutrients like I said we ran

1436
01:06:13,730 --> 01:06:18,289
the micronutrients we have yet to run

1437
01:06:15,530 --> 01:06:22,700
the macro nutrients so I'd love to talk

1438
01:06:18,289 --> 01:06:24,559
more with you just off air about that

1439
01:06:22,699 --> 01:06:26,539
that's actually very fascinating

1440
01:06:24,559 --> 01:06:32,449
especially if they're using a blue mat

1441
01:06:26,539 --> 01:06:34,250
system that could potentially mean well

1442
01:06:32,449 --> 01:06:35,750
we can talk later we can we can

1443
01:06:34,250 --> 01:06:38,588
speculate about that later I appreciate

1444
01:06:35,750 --> 01:06:41,599
you hearing me out let's move on to your

1445
01:06:38,588 --> 01:06:44,078
micronutrient disorders coz you had some

1446
01:06:41,599 --> 01:06:49,519
interesting stuff going on there too

1447
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:51,200
yeah so like I said one of the nutrients

1448
01:06:49,519 --> 01:06:55,599
that I'd like to specifically highlight

1449
01:06:51,199 --> 01:07:00,230
would be boron and again that is

1450
01:06:55,599 --> 01:07:03,079
involved in the essentially cell wall

1451
01:07:00,230 --> 01:07:05,240
development and stabilization and so

1452
01:07:03,079 --> 01:07:08,710
especially if you experience a boron

1453
01:07:05,239 --> 01:07:11,239
deficiency and then you're close to your

1454
01:07:08,710 --> 01:07:13,940
initiation of reproduction and you don't

1455
01:07:11,239 --> 01:07:16,519
remedy that like I said one thing that

1456
01:07:13,940 --> 01:07:18,559
we saw is we have little to no flower

1457
01:07:16,519 --> 01:07:20,929
bud formation due to the fact that

1458
01:07:18,559 --> 01:07:23,929
meristematic region was not able to

1459
01:07:20,929 --> 01:07:29,328
properly develop and expand into the

1460
01:07:23,929 --> 01:07:31,969
developing flower bud and as far as I

1461
01:07:29,329 --> 01:07:33,380
guess we can cut talk about how copper

1462
01:07:31,969 --> 01:07:36,319
was their specific one that you want I

1463
01:07:33,380 --> 01:07:37,910
do address no I think what your your the

1464
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:40,160
overview you're giving is great I will

1465
01:07:37,909 --> 01:07:41,750
just caution listeners that when we're

1466
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:43,909
talking about these micronutrients we're

1467
01:07:41,750 --> 01:07:46,760
talking about very very small amounts

1468
01:07:43,909 --> 01:07:49,399
typically parts per million you don't

1469
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:51,829
need a lot of boron for a plant to be

1470
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:53,450
sufficient so you know don't go out

1471
01:07:51,829 --> 01:07:55,130
there and buy borax and apply a bunch to

1472
01:07:53,449 --> 01:07:56,809
your soil and think you're fixing a

1473
01:07:55,130 --> 01:07:58,760
deficiency because you'll probably kill

1474
01:07:56,809 --> 01:08:00,019
your plant I just want to highlight that

1475
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:01,780
for people when we talk about

1476
01:08:00,019 --> 01:08:04,159
micronutrients we're talking about

1477
01:08:01,780 --> 01:08:07,940
typically pretty small levels of

1478
01:08:04,159 --> 01:08:11,358
nutrient that's actually needed yeah

1479
01:08:07,940 --> 01:08:11,539
that's a fantastic point and to add to

1480
01:08:11,358 --> 01:08:14,500
that

1481
01:08:11,539 --> 01:08:17,088
in this experiment we added a boron

1482
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:19,548
toxicity treatment so essentially what

1483
01:08:17,088 --> 01:08:21,890
we did is we took that modified Poland

1484
01:08:19,548 --> 01:08:24,738
solution we took the boron levels and we

1485
01:08:21,890 --> 01:08:28,160
increase them tenfold of what the

1486
01:08:24,738 --> 01:08:31,759
Hoagland solution requires and we did

1487
01:08:28,159 --> 01:08:33,349
that with manganese as well and the

1488
01:08:31,759 --> 01:08:36,409
reason we do that is because we often

1489
01:08:33,350 --> 01:08:38,600
see like you said it's very easy to over

1490
01:08:36,409 --> 01:08:41,149
apply a micronutrient so we also wanted

1491
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:44,029
to try and capture some of those

1492
01:08:41,149 --> 01:08:46,009
toxicity some phonologies because not

1493
01:08:44,029 --> 01:08:47,360
every nutrient in

1494
01:08:46,010 --> 01:08:49,070
shew that you run into will be a

1495
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:51,289
deficiency sometimes you're over

1496
01:08:49,069 --> 01:08:53,059
applying something or something is too

1497
01:08:51,289 --> 01:08:55,489
available or the plant is taking up too

1498
01:08:53,060 --> 01:08:57,710
much of something or you know another

1499
01:08:55,489 --> 01:08:59,899
element may be in such high quantities

1500
01:08:57,710 --> 01:09:04,850
that it's causing another element to be

1501
01:08:59,899 --> 01:09:06,049
plant unavailable yeah and it's what's

1502
01:09:04,850 --> 01:09:08,960
interesting I'm looking through these

1503
01:09:06,050 --> 01:09:12,289
photos right now a boron initial boron

1504
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:15,289
toxicity looks almost exactly like your

1505
01:09:12,289 --> 01:09:19,239
initial potassium deficiency they're

1506
01:09:15,289 --> 01:09:22,069
very close correct and I think that's

1507
01:09:19,239 --> 01:09:23,719
interesting for people because I've seen

1508
01:09:22,069 --> 01:09:25,309
people walk into a grow room look at a

1509
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:27,050
plant and immediately say oh that's

1510
01:09:25,310 --> 01:09:30,380
nitrogen though that's potassium oh

1511
01:09:27,050 --> 01:09:33,710
whatever and that always makes me

1512
01:09:30,380 --> 01:09:35,569
nervous because there are there's so

1513
01:09:33,710 --> 01:09:38,359
many variables associated with this I

1514
01:09:35,569 --> 01:09:39,829
mean a lot of especially in soils a lot

1515
01:09:38,359 --> 01:09:41,899
of your nutrient deficiencies in

1516
01:09:39,829 --> 01:09:43,609
excesses can be related to hydrology or

1517
01:09:41,899 --> 01:09:45,319
the way that you're watering by just

1518
01:09:43,609 --> 01:09:47,210
under watering your plant you can cause

1519
01:09:45,319 --> 01:09:48,409
a lot of nutrient deficiencies because

1520
01:09:47,210 --> 01:09:50,840
the microbes aren't able to cycle

1521
01:09:48,409 --> 01:09:54,229
nutrients effectively due to a lack of

1522
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:55,880
water so or due to lack of osmotic

1523
01:09:54,229 --> 01:09:57,139
pressure move those nutrients throughout

1524
01:09:55,880 --> 01:10:00,409
the plant so I think that's really

1525
01:09:57,140 --> 01:10:01,730
important to highlight I just want to

1526
01:10:00,409 --> 01:10:04,939
point that out while we're while we're

1527
01:10:01,729 --> 01:10:06,889
on the topic yeah I think that's a great

1528
01:10:04,939 --> 01:10:08,689
point I find one of the most helpful

1529
01:10:06,890 --> 01:10:12,920
things you can ask any grower of any

1530
01:10:08,689 --> 01:10:16,309
crop is first and foremost for a crop

1531
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:18,829
history because most of the times you're

1532
01:10:16,310 --> 01:10:21,410
seeing something that is an issue that

1533
01:10:18,829 --> 01:10:26,090
was created sometime in the past it is

1534
01:10:21,409 --> 01:10:29,119
now manifesting and so that's a

1535
01:10:26,090 --> 01:10:31,190
fantastic point and I'm glad to see that

1536
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:33,170
there's other people out there who are

1537
01:10:31,189 --> 01:10:35,539
you know stopping and thinking and

1538
01:10:33,170 --> 01:10:39,380
taking a more holistic approach to you

1539
01:10:35,539 --> 01:10:40,369
know diagnosing issues yeah was there

1540
01:10:39,380 --> 01:10:42,529
anything else you want to touch on

1541
01:10:40,369 --> 01:10:44,630
regarding the manganese or boron

1542
01:10:42,529 --> 01:10:47,929
toxicities that you saw or either of

1543
01:10:44,630 --> 01:10:52,489
those elements in general in relation to

1544
01:10:47,930 --> 01:10:55,039
plant growth or plant health yeah one

1545
01:10:52,489 --> 01:10:57,289
thing I will say is when looking at

1546
01:10:55,039 --> 01:10:59,960
toxicities and you can see this in the

1547
01:10:57,289 --> 01:11:01,969
photos and I hope that this photo also

1548
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:05,480
gets posted so the listeners can

1549
01:11:01,969 --> 01:11:08,750
reference it you will often see that

1550
01:11:05,479 --> 01:11:10,309
toxicity sent rhinology regardless of

1551
01:11:08,750 --> 01:11:12,738
element follows a very specific

1552
01:11:10,310 --> 01:11:17,180
progression where you see that you know

1553
01:11:12,738 --> 01:11:19,789
marginal chlorosis so that yellowing of

1554
01:11:17,180 --> 01:11:22,460
the margin first and then it will

1555
01:11:19,789 --> 01:11:26,510
progress to the marginal necrosis which

1556
01:11:22,460 --> 01:11:29,239
is that burning or that the browning of

1557
01:11:26,510 --> 01:11:31,159
the leaf margin and you'll see that and

1558
01:11:29,238 --> 01:11:33,309
you can see that in you know the

1559
01:11:31,159 --> 01:11:36,380
comparison image that we have between

1560
01:11:33,310 --> 01:11:39,710
manganese toxicity and boron toxicity

1561
01:11:36,380 --> 01:11:42,250
you know that the marginal symptomology

1562
01:11:39,710 --> 01:11:44,689
is very pronounced in almost any

1563
01:11:42,250 --> 01:11:48,050
toxicity so just kind of as a side note

1564
01:11:44,689 --> 01:11:50,079
you know being careful and cautious when

1565
01:11:48,050 --> 01:11:52,539
you know dealing with the leaf margin

1566
01:11:50,079 --> 01:11:57,050
especially if it's going chlorotic or

1567
01:11:52,539 --> 01:11:59,149
necrotic yeah that's that's excellent

1568
01:11:57,050 --> 01:12:01,010
advice I that wasn't something I was

1569
01:11:59,149 --> 01:12:02,960
aware of or had really ever thought of

1570
01:12:01,010 --> 01:12:05,390
honestly when I think of toxicities so

1571
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:06,859
I'm glad you pointed that out yeah did

1572
01:12:05,390 --> 01:12:10,039
you want to touch on did you want to

1573
01:12:06,859 --> 01:12:14,199
move on to your what looks like iron and

1574
01:12:10,039 --> 01:12:22,159
zinc were the next two on in your paper

1575
01:12:14,199 --> 01:12:24,529
yeah so again as I stated magnesium

1576
01:12:22,159 --> 01:12:27,019
toxicity or magnesium deficiency

1577
01:12:24,529 --> 01:12:29,059
manganese deficiency iron deficiency

1578
01:12:27,020 --> 01:12:32,120
they all kind of have this intervene all

1579
01:12:29,060 --> 01:12:36,410
chlorosis symptom symptoms that develop

1580
01:12:32,119 --> 01:12:38,779
on the foliage and so you know doing

1581
01:12:36,409 --> 01:12:41,569
work like this we're trying as best we

1582
01:12:38,779 --> 01:12:44,238
can to develop these criterias and

1583
01:12:41,569 --> 01:12:46,429
checklist suppose visually and with leaf

1584
01:12:44,238 --> 01:12:48,619
tissue to help people diagnose things

1585
01:12:46,430 --> 01:12:51,710
but a lot of times the symptom ologies

1586
01:12:48,619 --> 01:12:53,869
are very similar so being careful that

1587
01:12:51,710 --> 01:12:56,529
when you're looking at these that you're

1588
01:12:53,869 --> 01:12:59,000
taking again a holistic approach and

1589
01:12:56,529 --> 01:13:02,259
trying to utilize the tools that are

1590
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:06,890
available to you to help diagnose these

1591
01:13:02,260 --> 01:13:09,619
the iron deficiency again you'll get the

1592
01:13:06,890 --> 01:13:12,770
severe inner vein of chlorosis and those

1593
01:13:09,619 --> 01:13:13,488
more advanced symptoms and hopefully you

1594
01:13:12,770 --> 01:13:15,440
know we can

1595
01:13:13,488 --> 01:13:18,738
identifying remedy iron before it gets

1596
01:13:15,439 --> 01:13:20,268
this level but letting the plants go out

1597
01:13:18,738 --> 01:13:23,629
this far that's one of the reasons that

1598
01:13:20,269 --> 01:13:26,059
we allowed you know the plants to grow

1599
01:13:23,630 --> 01:13:27,679
in these deficient conditions for so

1600
01:13:26,059 --> 01:13:30,079
long so that we'd have that gradient the

1601
01:13:27,679 --> 01:13:39,679
beginning I mean in advanced entomology

1602
01:13:30,078 --> 01:13:42,380
and as far as iron is concerned it is

1603
01:13:39,679 --> 01:13:44,748
another immobile element so for this

1604
01:13:42,380 --> 01:13:47,900
particular opponent if you're seeing

1605
01:13:44,748 --> 01:13:50,090
symptomology on the new expanding leaves

1606
01:13:47,899 --> 01:13:51,408
the growing portions the plants that the

1607
01:13:50,090 --> 01:13:53,119
portions of the plant that are actively

1608
01:13:51,408 --> 01:13:55,670
growing this is where you're going to be

1609
01:13:53,118 --> 01:13:59,689
seeing that you know intervene or

1610
01:13:55,670 --> 01:14:02,118
chlorosis and so looking at where on the

1611
01:13:59,689 --> 01:14:04,368
plant these symptoms are occurring will

1612
01:14:02,118 --> 01:14:06,380
help you identify and you know kind of

1613
01:14:04,368 --> 01:14:08,448
utilize that as a checklist you know is

1614
01:14:06,380 --> 01:14:11,659
this iron or is this you know a mobile

1615
01:14:08,448 --> 01:14:13,748
element and there's some wonderful

1616
01:14:11,658 --> 01:14:18,319
charts online that you all can utilize

1617
01:14:13,748 --> 01:14:20,899
if you just look at nutrient mobility in

1618
01:14:18,319 --> 01:14:22,279
plants it will tell you which there's

1619
01:14:20,899 --> 01:14:24,589
some charts out there that have you know

1620
01:14:22,279 --> 01:14:28,300
don't categorize mobile elements versus

1621
01:14:24,590 --> 01:14:32,920
in mobile elements and will help you

1622
01:14:28,300 --> 01:14:35,929
identify more it's it's a tool a

1623
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:40,960
diagnostic tool that you can utilize to

1624
01:14:35,929 --> 01:14:43,690
figure out which element you may be

1625
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:48,908
experiencing which nutrient may be

1626
01:14:43,689 --> 01:14:52,178
limiting in your fertility reading

1627
01:14:48,908 --> 01:14:54,469
that's great yeah I think you covered it

1628
01:14:52,179 --> 01:14:57,230
anything you want to touch on regarding

1629
01:14:54,469 --> 01:15:00,559
zinc or I see you mentioned even

1630
01:14:57,229 --> 01:15:02,178
molybdenum I have done zero work on the

1631
01:15:00,559 --> 01:15:05,659
lib to them I really don't know much

1632
01:15:02,179 --> 01:15:07,609
about it overall there's everything you

1633
01:15:05,658 --> 01:15:13,359
want to share in particular relating to

1634
01:15:07,609 --> 01:15:18,408
either of those yeah we utilized

1635
01:15:13,359 --> 01:15:22,069
molybdenum because it is a plant

1636
01:15:18,408 --> 01:15:25,279
essential micronutrients but as far as

1637
01:15:22,069 --> 01:15:27,289
plants that often display symptom ology

1638
01:15:25,279 --> 01:15:31,699
and molybdenum

1639
01:15:27,289 --> 01:15:33,470
see it's kind of hit or miss most of the

1640
01:15:31,699 --> 01:15:38,119
time I lived in them is more important

1641
01:15:33,470 --> 01:15:44,180
for Naja lating plants so plants that

1642
01:15:38,119 --> 01:15:47,090
will form associations with bacteria to

1643
01:15:44,180 --> 01:15:50,840
form root nodules to fix atmospheric

1644
01:15:47,090 --> 01:15:52,850
nitrogen such as your lagoons but for

1645
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:55,520
example poinsettias poinsettias will

1646
01:15:52,850 --> 01:15:57,320
often display a molybdenum deficiency so

1647
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:59,480
it was kind of hit or miss we kind of

1648
01:15:57,319 --> 01:16:03,889
threw it in just for fun to kind of see

1649
01:15:59,479 --> 01:16:06,500
what would happen but like I said and

1650
01:16:03,890 --> 01:16:07,150
you can look at the the composite

1651
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:10,699
picture

1652
01:16:07,149 --> 01:16:15,439
not much symptom ology occurred and we

1653
01:16:10,699 --> 01:16:18,529
did not have statistically significant

1654
01:16:15,439 --> 01:16:22,879
differences in dry weights even though

1655
01:16:18,529 --> 01:16:25,219
we did receive a statistically

1656
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:28,489
significant difference and leave tissue

1657
01:16:25,220 --> 01:16:30,409
concentration of molybdenum so basically

1658
01:16:28,489 --> 01:16:32,689
there was more molybdenum in the leaf

1659
01:16:30,409 --> 01:16:34,779
tissue in your treatment versus the

1660
01:16:32,689 --> 01:16:37,909
control however that didn't display

1661
01:16:34,779 --> 01:16:41,050
visually or in terms of your overall

1662
01:16:37,909 --> 01:16:43,220
biomass when you measure the two plants

1663
01:16:41,050 --> 01:16:45,619
it sounds like from what I'm from what

1664
01:16:43,220 --> 01:16:48,199
I'm getting one thing I will say is

1665
01:16:45,619 --> 01:16:50,930
because we use you know kelp things like

1666
01:16:48,199 --> 01:16:52,309
kelp meal and rock dust I have never

1667
01:16:50,930 --> 01:16:54,050
really worried about molybdenum I figure

1668
01:16:52,310 --> 01:16:55,280
we're picking some up through those

1669
01:16:54,050 --> 01:16:57,320
because they contain some of those

1670
01:16:55,279 --> 01:16:59,630
elements but I'll be curious to see as

1671
01:16:57,319 --> 01:17:01,069
you move through flower looking at

1672
01:16:59,630 --> 01:17:03,430
molybdenum if you start to see

1673
01:17:01,069 --> 01:17:06,429
sophistical e significant differences in

1674
01:17:03,430 --> 01:17:09,200
overall yield or cannabinoid content

1675
01:17:06,430 --> 01:17:10,490
that that might be interesting because

1676
01:17:09,199 --> 01:17:11,989
I'd like to maybe start playing around

1677
01:17:10,489 --> 01:17:15,229
with the addition of molybdenum to see

1678
01:17:11,989 --> 01:17:18,849
if it makes it has a real any real and

1679
01:17:15,229 --> 01:17:18,849
growth impact or plant health impact

1680
01:17:18,909 --> 01:17:27,279
yeah that's definitely something that

1681
01:17:22,939 --> 01:17:29,479
we'll be looking at with regard to our

1682
01:17:27,279 --> 01:17:31,219
statistical analysis on the

1683
01:17:29,479 --> 01:17:33,319
micronutrients study that we just

1684
01:17:31,220 --> 01:17:38,060
completed the raid over life cycle

1685
01:17:33,319 --> 01:17:40,219
experiment that all all of these

1686
01:17:38,060 --> 01:17:41,090
micronutrients it's going to be very

1687
01:17:40,220 --> 01:17:43,190
interesting just

1688
01:17:41,090 --> 01:17:47,230
see what happens with the different

1689
01:17:43,189 --> 01:17:47,229
rates over the life cycle of the plant

1690
01:17:47,469 --> 01:17:52,520
cool well I think you covered all my

1691
01:17:50,149 --> 01:17:55,129
questions I know there's some of the

1692
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:56,510
discussion explains some of your

1693
01:17:55,130 --> 01:17:57,710
findings which really fits with a lot I

1694
01:17:56,510 --> 01:17:59,659
think we already covered most of that

1695
01:17:57,710 --> 01:18:01,609
just in our discussion of the elements

1696
01:17:59,658 --> 01:18:05,210
but was there anything else you wanted

1697
01:18:01,609 --> 01:18:09,920
to add regarding this research before we

1698
01:18:05,210 --> 01:18:13,010
sign off yeah just again to reiterate

1699
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:14,779
that one of the most valuable things you

1700
01:18:13,010 --> 01:18:17,150
can do whenever you're looking at a

1701
01:18:14,779 --> 01:18:19,579
problem is utilizing the tools that you

1702
01:18:17,149 --> 01:18:21,259
have available to you you know looking

1703
01:18:19,579 --> 01:18:24,260
at what you did in the past to try and

1704
01:18:21,260 --> 01:18:26,929
figure out you know is for example you

1705
01:18:24,260 --> 01:18:29,960
used water am i providing enough water

1706
01:18:26,929 --> 01:18:33,949
and is that causing a nutrient issue de

1707
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:37,158
facto or you know did I apply something

1708
01:18:33,948 --> 01:18:39,259
that may now be in interacting and a

1709
01:18:37,158 --> 01:18:42,769
negative effect in the soil profile and

1710
01:18:39,260 --> 01:18:46,909
causing another element to be plant

1711
01:18:42,770 --> 01:18:49,280
unavailable and again this this work

1712
01:18:46,908 --> 01:18:51,019
where we're still in a process we're

1713
01:18:49,279 --> 01:18:53,979
learning we're producing science it's an

1714
01:18:51,020 --> 01:18:56,360
additive process so this is you know

1715
01:18:53,979 --> 01:19:00,229
visual symptom ology is correlated to

1716
01:18:56,359 --> 01:19:03,079
leaf tissue and you know these these

1717
01:19:00,229 --> 01:19:04,819
pictures are very helpful and useful but

1718
01:19:03,079 --> 01:19:07,939
again some of the symptomatology is

1719
01:19:04,819 --> 01:19:09,670
similar so looking at you know the

1720
01:19:07,939 --> 01:19:11,629
progression of the symptom ology

1721
01:19:09,670 --> 01:19:14,329
comparing that to the pictures and then

1722
01:19:11,630 --> 01:19:16,789
also looking at where on the plant those

1723
01:19:14,329 --> 01:19:20,630
symptoms are occurring will be extremely

1724
01:19:16,789 --> 01:19:22,609
useful oh I look forward to seeing

1725
01:19:20,630 --> 01:19:25,159
further research out of your University

1726
01:19:22,609 --> 01:19:27,348
and and you personally and I'm really

1727
01:19:25,158 --> 01:19:28,488
grateful for your time today and I look

1728
01:19:27,349 --> 01:19:30,590
forward to staying in touch and

1729
01:19:28,488 --> 01:19:32,029
hopefully we'll get to have you or

1730
01:19:30,590 --> 01:19:33,949
someone when your colleagues back on

1731
01:19:32,029 --> 01:19:36,819
soon to talk about some of the latest

1732
01:19:33,948 --> 01:19:37,969
research and use some of your findings

1733
01:19:36,819 --> 01:19:39,859
absolutely

1734
01:19:37,969 --> 01:19:41,349
yeah we're definitely very excited for a

1735
01:19:39,859 --> 01:19:44,059
lot of the research we're doing and

1736
01:19:41,349 --> 01:19:47,199
definitely even more excited to continue

1737
01:19:44,060 --> 01:19:50,719
talking with growers and producers to

1738
01:19:47,198 --> 01:19:51,049
you know understand the needs that they

1739
01:19:50,719 --> 01:19:53,689
have

1740
01:19:51,050 --> 01:19:54,920
as far as research is concerned it's

1741
01:19:53,689 --> 01:19:58,039
very much a to ace

1742
01:19:54,920 --> 01:20:00,529
treat what the industry needs and does

1743
01:19:58,039 --> 01:20:03,350
and the issues that they're experiencing

1744
01:20:00,529 --> 01:20:05,630
help us do better research that's more

1745
01:20:03,350 --> 01:20:09,010
applicable and helps the industry as a

1746
01:20:05,630 --> 01:20:11,480
whole so this bilateral exchange is

1747
01:20:09,010 --> 01:20:13,719
extremely important and definitely is

1748
01:20:11,479 --> 01:20:17,329
something that needs to continue in

1749
01:20:13,719 --> 01:20:18,920
greater quantity for all researchers

1750
01:20:17,329 --> 01:20:33,350
that are going to be doing work in hemp

1751
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:34,489
or cannabis that was Paul Coxon and you

1752
01:20:33,350 --> 01:20:36,230
were listening to the cannabis

1753
01:20:34,488 --> 01:20:38,659
cultivation and science podcast

1754
01:20:36,229 --> 01:20:56,678
