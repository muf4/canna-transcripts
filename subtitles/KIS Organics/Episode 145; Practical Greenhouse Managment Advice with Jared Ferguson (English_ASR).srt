Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and

3
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,320
Science podcast. I'm your host, Tad

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Hussy of Kiss Organics. This is the

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,760
podcast where we discuss the cutting

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
edge of growing from a science-based

7
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,519
perspective and draw top experts from

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,679
around the industry to share their

9
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:35,920
wisdom and knowledge. Before starting

10
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:37,439
the podcast, I wanted to share about an

11
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,280
exciting new conference that we are

12
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:41,920
hosting in conjunction with Collective

13
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,679
Elevation in Bosezeman, Montana. I've

14
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,840
been talking to Suzanne Wayright Evans,

15
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:48,159
the bug lady, about hosting a conference

16
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,000
for years, and Adam at Collective

17
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:52,398
graciously offered to open up his doors

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,399
and let us host it on his property. The

19
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:57,920
event is happening September 5th through

20
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:59,759
the 7th, 2025. And I'm super excited. We

21
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:03,198
are kicking it off with workshops from

22
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:05,438
the bug lady Suzanne and Dr. Nadia Saba,

23
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:07,519
also known as Dr. Greenhouse, followed

24
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:09,679
by a facility tour and then a bunch of

25
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:12,640
excellent speakers and networking events

26
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:15,200
over the next three days. Then on the

27
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,040
7th, the Montana Living Soil Alliance is

28
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,640
hosting a tasting event that will be

29
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,640
included in the price of the conference

30
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,879

31
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,960
private event with cannabis donated by

32
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:27,199
the Living Soil Alliance as a way to

33
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:29,599
have an amazing sensory experience and

34
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,478

40
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,759
called the Cannabis Cultivation and

41
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,759
Science Conference. In honor of the

42
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,759
conference, I wanted to do an interview

43
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,920
series with some of the amazing folks at

44
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,599
Collective Elevation to give a grower's

45
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,519
perspective and share some of what

46
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:57,839
they've been able to accomplish. I've

47
00:01:55,519 --> 00:02:00,000
already had Adam Arnold on the podcast

48
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,000
and you can view also view a tour of

49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
their facility at the Kiss Organics

50
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,519
YouTube

51
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,519
page. My guest this week is Jared

52
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:09,439
Ferguson, the greenhouse manager at

53
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:11,439
Collective Elevation. He's been at

54
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:13,199
Collective for over four years now, but

55
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:15,359
prior to that, he studied environmental

56
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:18,318
horiculture at Montana State University

57
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,560
in Bosezeman, during which he worked for

58
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:22,799
the university's greenhouse facility and

59
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,199
research farm, where he got his first

60
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,360
experiences in mixing soil, amending

61
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:30,839
plants, managing irrigation, and

62
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,040
conducting IPM processes. Now, on to the

63
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,120
show. Jared, thanks for coming on the

64
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:37,199
show. Yeah, no problem. Thank you for

65
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,959
having me, Ted.

66
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:40,560
Yeah. So, you uh you've been with

67
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:44,039
Collective Elevation for a little while

68
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:46,239
now and you are the fertility uh

69
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:49,280
manager. I don't What is your exact

70
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:51,360
title? Uh greenhouse manager is what

71
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:55,318
I've been going with and no one's told

72
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:57,840
me no, so I going with that. Um yeah.

73
00:02:55,318 --> 00:02:59,759
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I do the uh fertility

74
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,158
management and kind of the irrigation

75
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:04,079
management and basically just uh taking

76
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:05,919
care of the green houses once we got

77
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,719
plants in there through their veg cycle

78
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:10,958
and uh flower cycle.

79
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:13,439
Yes. And as you know, irrigation and

80
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:16,000
fertility are tied very closely

81
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:17,519
together. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Can you just

82
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,598
tell me a little bit about your

83
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,080
experiences and what you've learned uh

84
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:24,318
since starting here at Collective?

85
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,640
Yeah, I've learned a ton. Um, so I came

86
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:27,839
from uh the academic background. So I

87
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:29,759
went to school at Montana State

88
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,400
University, got a horiculture degree

89
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:33,919
there. Um, and kind of the biggest thing

90
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,439
from transitioning from that over to

91
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:39,119
here was just kind of figuring out how

92
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:40,959
to take the big picture ideas of soil

93
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,080
fertility and doing your soil math and

94
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:46,080
everything from kind of a turf grass

95
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,680
management perspective like large scale

96
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,080
agriculture, vegetable farms, kind of

97
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,920
figuring out how to combine all of that

98
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:55,120
to a system that's going to work good in

99
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:57,518
a soilless media in a greenhouse. Um, so

100
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,000
yeah, I learned a lot specifically when

101
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,280
I initially trans transitioned over just

102
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,318
um about the plant itself because I

103
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,400
hadn't really worked with cannabis

104
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:07,359
before. So learning photo periods, all

105
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:10,400
that stuff. Um, yeah, and then from then

106
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,959
on just kind of dialing in the nutrient

107
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,158
program over time after I I kind of gone

108
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,040
through and figured out how I wanted to

109
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:18,478
be doing the soil math. Um, slowly kind

110
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,919
of figuring out what works best for us

111
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,279
in our our green houses because

112
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:23,359
obviously every growing system is a

113
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,879
little bit different. So figuring out

114
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,360
like how to adapt what I learned through

115
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:30,639
other people for our specific situation.

116
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:33,919
Um yeah, I was able to do the uh the

117
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:35,680
soil doctor cons uh his soil fertility

118
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:37,439
course um a few years ago and that was

119
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,560
super helpful just kind of like giving

120
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:43,519
me a a path to kind of figure out how to

121
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:46,319
bridge that gap there. But yeah,

122
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:47,599
yeah, Bryant Bryant Mason's course is a

123
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:49,759
good resource for people who are

124
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,240
interested in learning how to do their

125
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,319
own soil fertility. Um, it's well it's

126
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,160
well worth it. We do actually. Yeah. No,

127
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:57,199
it was

128
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,280
Oh, I was just going to throw out a

129
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,040
shameless plug. If you type in Kiss

130
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:04,638
Organics, all one word, I think you get

131
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:06,879
a discount on it, too. So, um, there is

132
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,960
that. But, uh, yeah, getting back to it.

133
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:10,879
So, when you when you first got here,

134
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:14,319
how were how were you guys managing

135
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:16,399
fertility in the green houses?

136
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:18,319
Um, so when I initially started, um, I

137
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:21,198
got hired on as an assistant kind of to

138
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:22,560
start out. Um, and then we had a

139
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,360
fertility manager who was kind of

140
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,478
transitioning out at that point. Um, he

141
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,680
had his own method of kind of doing

142
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:29,279
things. I think he was using the soil

143
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,280
doctor class as well as kind of a guide

144
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:34,719
as far as our targets and everything go.

145
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:36,239
Um, and so we had kind of that like

146
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,360
framework that we were using, but we

147
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,918
were really once he left, we were kind

148
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:44,720
of basically taking old soil amendment

149
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:46,399
plans that he had created and still soil

150
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,039
testing and everything and like looking

151
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:51,359
at those with their the soil test they

152
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:53,120
were referencing. Um, and then kind of

153
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,720
using our current soil tests and kind of

154
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,038
trying to extrapolate off of that and

155
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,800
figure out like, okay, well, he did this

156
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:01,439
for this case, so how do we adjust that

157
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,840
for our current situation? Um there was

158
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:06,000
a period where we were kind of we're

159
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:08,239
using a fertilizer mix and so we were

160
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,319
just kind of broadly targeting all

161
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,639
nutrients making sure we had fertility

162
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,960
in every area there. Um which was good

163
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,360
for a while but I do feel like it ended

164
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:18,719
up with us kind of adding too much. We

165
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,759
were getting into situations where we

166
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,759
had high sulfur or high magnesium and we

167
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,199
didn't have a way to with this mix to

168
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:29,919
apply nitrogen without also adding that

169
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:31,759
in. So from then we kind of started to

170
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:33,279
transition. My first summer was about

171
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,479
like that where we were doing the using

172
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:37,038
the fertilizer mix and kind of

173
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:38,800
extrapolating old data. And then going

174
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:41,839
into the winter I was able to go through

175
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,199
that course and with that just kind of

176
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:45,839
figure out how to start targeting

177
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,120
specific nutrients. Um and from there

178
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:49,758
figuring out how to bridge the gap with

179
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,879
my soil math to make it match up for

180
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,199
what I want to be doing for like a

181
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,879
soilless media because obviously there's

182
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,800
huge differences between the soilless

183
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:59,199
media versus an actual soil outdoors.

184
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,280
And so figuring out what I need to take

185
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:04,800
into account, disregard and stuff for

186
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:05,879
our uh container grown plants. Um at one

187
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,478
point we

188
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:10,399
did we sent some soil tests off to both

189
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:12,560
you and the soil doctor and I kind of

190
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:14,000
did my own like amendment plan for it

191
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,399
and then compared them with the two and

192
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,959
was like, "Okay, well I'm not 100%

193
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:20,399
accurate, but I'm not super far off." So

194
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:21,519
use that to kind of double check some

195
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:24,478
work and everything and keep like

196
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:26,000
building up from there. Um, yeah. And

197
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:28,000
that was about the that's kind of the

198
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,759
initial stage.

199
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,399
Yeah. So, uh, for people who are

200
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:35,598
unfamiliar, uh, I just want to back up

201
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:38,079
on a couple things and state that, yeah,

202
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:39,839
Collective Elevation, if you want to see

203
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:42,399
the facility that we're talking about,

204
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:44,478
there is a YouTube tour on our Kiss

205
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:47,439
Organics YouTube channel that people can

206
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:49,519
go back and watch. And then uh, this a

207
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:51,038
lot of the soil that you have is our

208
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:53,439
commercial growers mix. That's what was

209
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:55,839
in the beds. But you guys got that in

210
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:58,719
years ago now. Yes. I think even before

211
00:07:55,839 --> 00:08:01,359
you were at Collective, so it's really

212
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,520
your soil at this point. Yeah. Yeah. It

213
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,240
was about right when I started. We were

214
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:07,758
um so we had two Nexus green houses that

215
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,960
have had soil in them for about I think

216
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,960
it's about seven years old at this

217
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:13,519
point. It's very old soil. Um that was

218
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:16,399
prekiss soil. Um I think they mix that

219
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:17,918
up themselves. Um, and then as I started

220
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:19,758
that summer, we were building out our

221
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:21,198
NextG facilities, and those are the ones

222
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,879
that we filled with the Kiss soil. So,

223
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:25,478
those were kind of my first fall here

224
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:28,000
was my first uh cycle through with Kiss

225
00:08:25,478 --> 00:08:30,439
soil. Um, but yeah, and so even within

226
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,958
that, it's really cool to see just

227
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:34,958
like wide differences between the two

228
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:36,559
soils. Um, and even between the green

229
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:38,478
houses with that kiss soil in it because

230
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:40,079
over time we just get through

231
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,360
microclimates and everything within the

232
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,200
greenhouse, we start to just see

233
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,639
different trends based off which our

234
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,040
north greenhouse versus our south

235
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:48,559
greenhouse with how they're lined up.

236
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:50,000
Um, a lot of small microclimates within

237
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:52,079
the green houses themselves just in the

238
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,839
beds and everything and kind of like

239
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,200
getting to spend the time in there to be

240
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,200
able to observe that and actually notice

241
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,720
it has been super super helpful. And

242
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,920
then we've started to kind of tailor

243
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,360
each amendment plan towards each

244
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:05,360
greenhouse and then our season and

245
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,000
everything as well.

246
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,839
That's that's really interesting. Um

247
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
yeah, so one thing that when you when

248
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,640
you mention soilless media being

249
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,799
different than actual soil, what you're

250
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:19,199
referencing is actually this kiss soil.

251
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:21,759
So what we're calling living soil

252
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,000
indoors is not actual soil. It doesn't

253
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:26,399
have sand, salt, and clay. Yes. In it.

254
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,320
Yes, it's it what aronomists would call

255
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,000
soilless media. I just in case people

256
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,480
are confusing the the terminology

257
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,958
because it is confusing. Um I just

258
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,959
wanted to add that. But uh I want to ask

259
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:38,879
you so you mentioned that you're soil

260
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:41,439
testing. What does that actually look

261
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:43,360
like in reality? Like take me through

262
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,760
when in the cycle you take those tests,

263
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,159
when you get them back, and then how you

264
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:50,159
use that interpretation in your as a

265
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:52,958
guidance for what you're doing. Yeah.

266
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:55,600
Um, so as far as the timing on it, we're

267
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:57,039
taking it about day 56 of flower is kind

268
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,720
of the latest I can take it and still

269
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:00,240
get them back reason in reasonable

270
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,879
enough time for us to do our amendment

271
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,320
before our next cycle. So it's hard

272
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:05,679
because obviously I' I'd rather wait

273
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,600
later, take them right at the end of the

274
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:09,199
cycle. But um, being commercial

275
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,399
production, we kind of got to keep that

276
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,080
going. So obviously they're a little

277
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:16,240
less accurate with taking them earlier.

278
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:18,639
But um, that process itself is we have a

279
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,120
soil core probe thing that we're taking

280
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:23,600
the test with. Um, I'm taking I usually

281
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,799
go about every 8 ft in a room. I'll take

282
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,879
a sample. Your your soil test is only as

283
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:30,719
good as your sample is representative of

284
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:32,559
your room. So, trying to get the most

285
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,000
representative sample as I can, which is

286
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:35,759
obviously you're never going to get that

287
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,399
unless you tested the entirety of your

288
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:39,759
soil volume, but making sure that I'm

289
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,278
taking a wide range of tests from all

290
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:43,360
over in the greenhouse so that I can

291
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:46,639
have as as representative of a sample as

292
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:49,120
possible. Um, sending those off to Logan

293
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:50,159
Labs. Great lab. um usually get our

294
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,360
results back super quickly and

295
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:53,519
everything from them and I just like the

296
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,839
layout of their how they uh present the

297
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,919
data and everything on it. We are

298
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,720
typically doing I think it's their

299
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:02,799
complete test but it is a standard mic 3

300
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,120
soil test a saturated pace test where

301
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:06,879
we're sending our own water in with it

302
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,560
um and then they give us like our

303
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,919
micronutrients and like our silica and

304
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:12,958
our nitrate numbers and everything on

305
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:14,639
that as well.

306
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:16,559
Yeah. And one thing that I've noticed,

307
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:21,360
and I've talked to Bryant about this,

308
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:23,439
uh, is we've had guys test every bed

309
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,839
individually and then also test the

310
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,079
entire room, you know, maybe so maybe

311
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:30,320
like 20 tests as composed of like one

312
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:32,000
composite test that's that's mixed of

313
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,240
all those and they all tend to be fairly

314
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,120
similar unless we have like one real

315
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:39,278
outlier bed. Uh, has your experience

316
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,078
sort of agreed with that? And how many

317
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:44,639
tests do you do per greenhouse? How big

318
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:46,559
approximately is your greenhouse? So,

319
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:48,958
we're doing composite tests with them.

320
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:50,399
In the past, we have done individual

321
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:52,719
beds and sent those off and we kind of

322
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,839
found the same thing where we were like

323
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,600
within 10 to 20% at the most difference

324
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:59,519
between beds. And it really is would be

325
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,360
like we're testing a bed that is

326
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,480
absolutely getting less light versus one

327
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,839
that gets a ton of light. And that's

328
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,399
where we're seeing like the slight

329
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,399
differences. Um, so for the most part,

330
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:11,600
we're sending off a composite sample for

331
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:13,600
our green houses. Um, so we have four

332
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,720
houses altogether. I don't know the

333
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,800
exact square footage of the house

334
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:20,560
itself, but we have in our smaller ones,

335
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:24,479
we have four rows of what is it? 84 feet

336
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:26,638
by 4 feet wide by about 2 feet deep. Um,

337
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:30,399
and then in our larger green houses, we

338
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:32,159
have six rows of 88 feet at about a foot

339
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:35,519
and a half deep probably. So, a little

340
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:38,480
bit different volume there. Um, yeah.

341
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:40,000
Yeah. And so you found that one test

342
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,360
gives you a pretty good idea of what's

343
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,120
going on in the room. And that saves a

344
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,720
ton of money as a grower. So if you are

345
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,720
thinking about going this route, don't

346
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,639
feel like you have to test every bed.

347
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,000
Yeah. You don't. Yeah. No, I think it

348
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,120
gives you a pretty good composite. And I

349
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,159
would say if you if you feel like you

350
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,480
have something going on in the room,

351
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:55,759
like if there's a bed that's wildly

352
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,519
behaving differently than others, then

353
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:59,120
you can look into that. And then at that

354
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,639
point, tissue testing as well, just to

355
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,519
know what's going on inside your plants.

356
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,959
Actually, um, we tissue test

357
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,078
periodically. We don't do it every

358
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:07,599
single round. It's something I'd like to

359
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:09,439
do every single round, but at a certain

360
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,000
point, you're you got to balance the how

361
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,720
much data are we getting and using um

362
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,240
kind of there. But, uh yeah, the tissue

363
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,160
testing can be really helpful if you're

364
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,519
in a situation like that. Um and in the

365
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:20,799
past, we've done that. Typically, when

366
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,120
we have a greenhouse where it's like

367
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:25,439
something seems off, we'll do that and

368
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,200
it's usually been pretty representative

369
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,480
of what our saturated pace test is kind

370
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:32,240
of reading. Um, as long as you are

371
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,079
getting adequate or getting not just

372
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,519
adequate water, but getting a good

373
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:37,278
watering program to where your plants

374
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,480
are able to take up those plant

375
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:39,919
available nutrients that you're seeing

376
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,278
in that saturated paste test, it's

377
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:45,360
usually pretty representative.

378
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:47,278
Yeah, that's a that's a great point

379
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,000
touching on the watering. I will just

380
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:52,399
add one note that taking one test for a

381
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,320
room is sort of predicated on the idea

382
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:56,078
that you're treating all the beds

383
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,639
exactly the same. So if you start

384
00:13:56,078 --> 00:14:01,198
amending all the beds individually

385
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,879
different, I think then you're kind of

386
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:06,159
forcing your hand into having to test

387
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:08,720
them all. Exactly. Yeah.

388
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:10,519
Um but how does how does water play a

389
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,360
role in

390
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:14,560
um well I mean I was going to say how

391
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,240
does water play a role in terms of

392
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:20,638
nutrient availability but I know that's

393
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:23,360
kind of a obvious one. Um, how do you

394
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:26,399
have a real life example though of how

395
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:28,480
uh irrigation changes have impacted

396
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,399
available fertility in your beds where

397
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,480
maybe you had sufficient fertility but

398
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:35,919
it was too cold or you weren't watering

399
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,600
properly? Um, yeah. So, just with the

400
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:39,679
the microclimates kind of in the

401
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,879
greenhouse in general. Um, our nexus

402
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:45,278
green houses we have they are east to

403
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:46,799
west facing the east end of the wall

404
00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:49,360
gets shaded out in the morning time.

405
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:50,639
There is a solid like about six foot

406
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,159
section of that bed that gets

407
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:55,039
considerably less light for the first

408
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:56,719
few hours of the day in those beds which

409
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:58,000
again I guess this isn't just directly

410
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,399
water and that's also bringing light

411
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,919
into account but in those beds they are

412
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,519
they always are holding water like those

413
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:05,278
sections are holding water significantly

414
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:08,799
longer than the rest of the bed itself

415
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:10,399
and just that row. Um and with those we

416
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:12,479
will see a lot more kind of towards the

417
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,320
end of flowering like plants that look

418
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,320
not as far along as the rest of the row.

419
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,519
So plants that don't look as developed,

420
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,639
they maybe are still a little too dark

421
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,879
green. They almost look like they have

422
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,240
too much nitrogen at the time, they

423
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:23,679
haven't been like processing as much

424
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,600
because they just haven't been taking up

425
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:28,399
as much water due to not having as much

426
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:31,199
light and also just um and just having a

427
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:33,600
more saturated environment around them.

428
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:35,759
Um and then we've also seen the case too

429
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,320
where with underwatering as well, you

430
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:39,519
kind of develop those same

431
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:41,278
like things that look like nutrient

432
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,879
deficiencies, but the soil itself might

433
00:15:41,278 --> 00:15:44,799
not be deficient. the plant is just not

434
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:46,879
getting it because you don't have the

435
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:49,919
proper environment around the plant for

436
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:51,679
it to uptake those nutrients. Um, we

437
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:53,278
kind of see that just seasonal

438
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:54,879
differences. We have areas in the

439
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:57,278
summertime that just get blasted by

440
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:59,679
sunlight and they are like at least a

441
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:01,439
touchup water almost every day and then

442
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:02,958
down to the winter time we have rooms

443
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,560
sometimes where we'll go like four days

444
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:06,000
without watering it. So, it just really

445
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:08,479
is there's a lot of huge seasonal

446
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,519
variability here. Um, and that's kind of

447
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:13,759
the best representation

448
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:15,278
of how water and water like uh

449
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,959
availability kind of plays a role in

450
00:16:15,278 --> 00:16:20,879
that. So you're not treating the whole

451
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:22,719
greenhouse uh the exact same way when it

452
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:24,838
comes to irrigation. You're basing it on

453
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,839
Yeah. the beds. And how are you

454
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:31,279
measuring that? So we measure both

455
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:33,279
through we have a uh a blue lab um pulse

456
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:35,600
which does volutric water content. We

457
00:16:33,278 --> 00:16:38,958
that's not our main source. We use um

458
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,720
the arometer probes uh the tensometers

459
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:42,879
um and so we use those. I feel like that

460
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,320
gives us a more accurate kind of idea of

461
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:46,919
what the plant itself is going through

462
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:49,920
because uh the volutric water content is

463
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:51,519
great but the number kind of if you're

464
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:52,958
doing a certain number dryback on that

465
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,639
it's really only applicable to that

466
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:57,439
specific room that you found that number

467
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,799
is like a good one for. Um once you

468
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,959
start looking at because we do have

469
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:03,039
different soils in different rooms,

470
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:05,359
let's say 15% dryback in some of our

471
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:06,879
zones is a lot different stress than 15%

472
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:09,519
dryback would be in some other ones just

473
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,120
because we have older soils, smaller

474
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:12,639
pore space. It's holding on to that

475
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:15,359
water a lot more. So it might have the

476
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,880
same volutric water content, but that um

477
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,639
the tension that it actually takes the

478
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,240
roots to pull that in is a lot more and

479
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,959
it's a lot more just osmotic stress on

480
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,880
the roots. Um but yeah, this the main

481
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,360
way we're going about it is using um we

482
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,960
have barometers in every greenhouse um

483
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:31,279
kind of checking those and watering

484
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,798
based off of uh certain kpa numbers. And

485
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:34,798
now we are transitioning into where

486
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:36,639
we're going to start testing out some

487
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:38,879
volutric water content probes that we'll

488
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,799
bury in the beds as well. And then kind

489
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,880
of the process with that is going to be

490
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:44,798
putting a a probe in the bed and then

491
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,919
also putting an arometer next to it,

492
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:49,519
watching what finding out what 20 kpa on

493
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,120
our arometer actually is as far as

494
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:53,599
dryback for our plants and kind of

495
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:55,439
adjusting our numbers based off that for

496
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:58,399
each room specifically rather than just

497
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,519
the whole grow. Yeah, that's very cool.

498
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,759
Very cool. And I like the way you

499
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:04,160
explained that. Um that's a very good

500
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:06,558
point. I I like the blue lab pulse

501
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,400
meter. I mean, we sell them at Kiss. I I

502
00:18:06,558 --> 00:18:10,960
think they're a really cool tool. They

503
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,360
give you a very fast number and I like

504
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,759
that I can correlate a photo in the app

505
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:17,678
with the moisture notes and everything

506
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:20,240
too. Yeah. But I totally agree the

507
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,759
arometers are going to be more accurate.

508
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,240
And I just want to highlight where you

509
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:26,879
said you can't take the same percentage

510
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:30,240
on that um volutric reading on the pulse

511
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:32,960
lab the pulse meter and uh use it across

512
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,640
different media. Um

513
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,319
and expect to get the same results I

514
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:39,200
guess. Yeah, that that was a really good

515
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:41,200
point. So, thanks for having Yeah. Yeah,

516
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,360
for sure. One other thing that you

517
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,360
mentioned around your when you time your

518
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:47,119
soil test that I wanted to add because I

519
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:49,918
happen to just know this that you guys

520
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:52,239
keep all the amendments that you use on

521
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,000
site so that when you go to remend, you

522
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,400
don't have to place an order with a

523
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,640
company to like or run somewhere to go

524
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,880
get these amendments. You have them all

525
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,640
on on site and ready to go. So, once you

526
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,679
get results back, you can amend right

527
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,520
away. Yeah. And uh yeah, we basically we

528
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,919
have half a fertilizer store essentially

529
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:11,759
in our pole barn. Um I maybe have gone a

530
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:13,280
little crazy in my ordering in the past

531
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:14,798
and gotten really hyped about some

532
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:16,079
specific nutrients and ordered a lot of

533
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:18,960
them and then realized I didn't need

534
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:21,519
that much. So what are your what are

535
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,360
your go-tos and what do you see yourself

536
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:25,359
using? I guess the same question. What

537
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:27,279
do you using the most your in terms of

538
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:30,798
your favorite amendments and I guess

539
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:32,319
trends in your soul fertility uh

540
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:35,038
amendments?

541
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:36,639
So, um, it's developed, it's changed a

542
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:38,919
lot since over the last few years, just

543
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:42,720
as I'm kind of figuring more stuff out.

544
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:44,960
Um, my main kind of idea is I want to

545
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,679
have for every nutrient we have, I want

546
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:50,079
to have a two different sources for it

547
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:52,798
if I can. That way, like say calcium for

548
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:54,639
example, if I'm only feeding gypsum and

549
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:56,160
I'm also feeding potassium sulfate and

550
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,600
maybe magnesium sulfate, I'm probably

551
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,440
going to get too high a sulfur at some

552
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:01,038
point. So, making sure I also have like

553
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,440
something like an axill so that I can

554
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:05,599
switch off or not an axil, a glassite

555
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,919
for for the calcium so I can switch off

556
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:11,038
and like add calcium in a different form

557
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:12,480
and kind of not take anything out of out

558
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:14,960
of where I want it to be just to get

559
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,679
other nutrients in there. Um, I would

560
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,519
say as far as historically our main

561
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:23,120
amendments have been we've used a lot of

562
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:27,599
fish meal, soybean meal, insect frra,

563
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:31,038
gypsum, sulfate of pot ash um as like

564
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:32,959
rock dust as well as a more recently um

565
00:20:31,038 --> 00:20:34,640
kind of currently right now we're

566
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,440
shifting some of our nitrogen toward

567
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:39,200
using uh blood meal feathermeal as kind

568
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,200
of our main nitrogen sources just so we

569
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,200
have that like

570
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:44,798
standalone 1300 rather than having the

571
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,519
phosphorus or the potassium attached to

572
00:20:44,798 --> 00:20:48,720
it. Um, and the thing I'm playing with

573
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:50,119
right now that I'm really excited about

574
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,798
is I'm kind of trying

575
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:54,239
to I'm taking my nitrogen goal and I'm

576
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:55,759
breaking it up into portions with

577
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:59,200
different breakdown rates for my

578
00:20:55,759 --> 00:21:01,839
fertilizer. So, I'm doing like a 25%

579
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,440
portion of kind of a blood meal, which

580
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:05,439
is a quicker breakdown so that they have

581
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,200
it more more available earlier. Then

582
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,440
like the middle section, I'm doing like

583
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:12,159
a moderate breakdown at about 50% of our

584
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:14,320
nitrogen goal and then a slow breakdown

585
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,600
as the last like 25%. So we're getting

586
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:17,038
like kind of a broad spectrum of

587
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:18,798
different nitrogen sources in there

588
00:21:17,038 --> 00:21:20,480
that'll be available at different times

589
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:22,480
as the plant needs it too. So kind of

590
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,240
trying to frontload our nitrogen

591
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,839
availability a bit, but then also have

592
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,519
enough for them to taper through their

593
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:30,639
cycle without like plummeting down to

594
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:32,319
like 10 ppm or something like that.

595
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:36,640
Yeah, nitrogen is definitely the

596
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:40,639
trickiest uh mineral to manage because a

597
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:42,400
huge pool of what our nitrogen is in in

598
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,640
these soils or in soil in general is

599
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:48,480
organic nitrogen which you can't really

600
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,759
see on these tests. So, um yeah. Yeah,

601
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,679
nitrogen is all a little bit guessing

602
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:53,359
game and I totally agree with you. Uh we

603
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:54,880
always with our recommendations want to

604
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:57,599
have at least two to three sources of

605
00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:00,640
nitrogen. I really like organic alalfa

606
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:01,918
meal even though it's not a big nitrogen

607
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,080
source. I just think it has a lot of

608
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:06,240
good like microbial benefits and other

609
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:09,279
things that it does that uh I like to

610
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,480
use it. But um yeah, that's that's

611
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:12,240
that's a really good point that you

612
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,000
brought up around having multiple

613
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,599
sources for different different

614
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,880
amendments.

615
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:19,119
Yeah, we definitely went through a phase

616
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,880
where we used a lot of alalfa meal. Um

617
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:22,239
and I I use it in all our tees and

618
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,080
everything as part of that recipe and

619
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,359
when we do do some like supplemental

620
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:28,000
feedings throughout the cycle, I'll use

621
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:29,199
it there. Um but yeah, as you were

622
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,480
saying, it's really really really low

623
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,400
nitrogen percentage, but you do get

624
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,519
carbon from it. Um it's a very good

625
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,240
carbon source and everything and just

626
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:37,440
organic source for the plants. Um yeah,

627
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,120
and we've used a lot of kelp meal as

628
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,798
well. There's we've used basically most

629
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:44,239
of the organic inputs you can think of.

630
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:46,079
We have a few bags of them out there. So

631
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,000
um yeah, kind of gone through a lot of

632
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:49,199
different sources. We walin's one that

633
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,558
we've been using a lot more recently

634
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,840
just because we were getting high sulfur

635
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:54,399
in some green houses and I was like all

636
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:55,918
right I need to figure out how to go

637
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,120
around this and not keep adding sulfur

638
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,480
because at at a certain point you're

639
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:00,079
just creating osmotic stress for your

640
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,440
plants and it's just going to create a

641
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:03,038
more stressful environment for them and

642
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,640
we want to we have enough other

643
00:23:03,038 --> 00:23:07,038
stressors that I want to try to limit as

644
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:10,320
much of that as possible on my end. Um

645
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:11,759
it's hard to kind of use stress to like

646
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:14,000
try to do crop steering if they're

647
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:16,079
always stressed. So trying to figure out

648
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,480
how to yeah keep them in a good spot and

649
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:20,480
make sure that again whatever I'm

650
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,038
amending I've got multiple options so I

651
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,839
can really kind of per soil test kind of

652
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:27,440
customize what we're doing each time.

653
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:31,359
Yeah, sulfur is an interesting one

654
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:34,159
because uh typically I find with our

655
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:36,158
soil tests is we tend to range more

656
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:37,840
alkaline because of the our in a lot of

657
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:39,200
our inputs are cat ions. you know, we're

658
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:43,359
using a lot of calcium, a lot of

659
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:45,360
potassium. Um, and so we we tend to push

660
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:48,079
the pH tends to be high. So, the sulfur

661
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:49,439
really helps balance that. But what and

662
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:52,720
we don't really see any issues with

663
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:54,080
sulfur toxicities per se, but you you

664
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,960
brought up the big issue with sulfur,

665
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:58,960
which is um essentially when you have

666
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,880
very excessive levels, you know, and

667
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:04,000
I've seen thousands of ppm of sulfur on

668
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:06,480
soil tests, what what can happen is uh

669
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,400
your soluble salt, the EC of your soil

670
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,558
becomes higher and then it's harder for

671
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:13,200
the plant to essentially acquire those

672
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:16,960
nutrients because of the osmotic

673
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:18,720
pressure around the roots. So, um, yeah,

674
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,600
just wanted to further explain what you

675
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,480
were talking about because I think

676
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:26,879
that's a really fascinating concept. So,

677
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:29,120
as as a soil, uh, you know, fertility

678
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:32,919
manager, you're always doing this dance

679
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:35,678
of balance with your nutrients.

680
00:24:32,919 --> 00:24:37,360
Um, that being said, something that that

681
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:39,120
uh Bryant always said that I really

682
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:40,879
appreciate and I take the same

683
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:44,079
philosophy is we always start with I

684
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:45,919
always start with sufficiency and then

685
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:49,038
balance. What has sort of been your

686
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:51,799
approach with with this whole process? I

687
00:24:49,038 --> 00:24:53,919
would say very similar as well like

688
00:24:51,798 --> 00:24:55,679
um taking into account both the

689
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,679
saturated and the standard tests um

690
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:59,600
trying to make sure that we have

691
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:01,200
obviously sufficient available nutrients

692
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:04,319
to the plants but then making sure that

693
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:06,480
we're in a situation where if I am

694
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:09,200
wildly out of whack on my cat ions like

695
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:11,519
if my ratios are not down in there if I

696
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,600
have like nuclear high which this hasn't

697
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:14,960
happened too much but um if I have out

698
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:16,719
of whack like calcium or anything like

699
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,720
that where it's kind of sitting high as

700
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:21,038
in as far as like our ratios of the rest

701
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,640
of the cat ions. It maybe makes me kind

702
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:24,480
of pause for a second about adding to

703
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,400
try to up my saturated pace test because

704
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,759
if we are at a high situation there then

705
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,000
we do have it in the soil. It's just

706
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:31,919
about getting it um plant plant plant

707
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,880
available and like uh mineralized over

708
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:36,159
and everything or demineralized.

709
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:38,360
Um, yeah. So, it's definitely kind of

710
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:41,520
sufficiency first is

711
00:25:38,359 --> 00:25:43,599
the main idea and then without

712
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:45,038
completely like disregarding what's

713
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:46,558
going on in our standard test and making

714
00:25:45,038 --> 00:25:48,720
sure we're not getting into a situation

715
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:50,639
where we're going to run into issues

716
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:54,480
with nutrients being tied up and not

717
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:58,320
become plant available. Um, yeah.

718
00:25:54,480 --> 00:26:02,480
Nice. Nice. And uh do you have any

719
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:04,480
examples of where you saw something on a

720
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:07,278
soil test that was then reflected in the

721
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:09,200
plant that you were able to address or

722
00:26:07,278 --> 00:26:12,159
correct in a way that increased yields

723
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:15,120
or fertility or plant health? High

724
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:16,720
nitrogen at harvest. I have definitely

725
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:18,399
put too much when I first started kind

726
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,440
of uh running the nutrient program.

727
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,919
There's a period where I was definitely

728
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:24,120
throwing too much nitrogen in there. Um,

729
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:26,559
we're seeing still plants that weren't

730
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:27,759
fully they're full not fully green, but

731
00:26:26,558 --> 00:26:29,519
they were still a lot greener than we

732
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:31,359
wanted them to be at the end. Um, and

733
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:33,440
then coming back on our soil test around

734
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:35,519
like 50 ppm of nitrate at the end of it,

735
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,200
which isn't where I want to be. Um,

736
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:39,119
trying to shoot more towards ending at

737
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,679
like 20 to 30 has been what I've seen

738
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:43,359
like do really well for us. Um, and then

739
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:46,159
just kind of lowering that top end

740
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:48,158
nitrogen goal down a bit to try to ease

741
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:49,919
us into that lower finishing at that

742
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:51,159
lower area. Um, that's been a really big

743
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:53,919
thing in winter

744
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:55,840
specifically just because we go from

745
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:57,840
having such intense sunlight in the

746
00:26:55,839 --> 00:26:59,519
summertime to when we're in January,

747
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:01,199
February here, if we got curtains closed

748
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:02,720
up, we're we're sitting maybe a little

749
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,120
bit under what we should be with light

750
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,798
by a few hundred PAR. Um, and so we're

751
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:08,639
definitely processing less nitrogen. And

752
00:27:06,798 --> 00:27:10,480
so I I have to change my thinking for

753
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:13,360
sure on our summertime runs versus our

754
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,640
wintertime runs. And now I'm kind of uh

755
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:16,479
coming up with different sets of

756
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,919
parameters for the two of them. um

757
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,839
treating the summers a lot differently,

758
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:21,200
pushing more nitrogen, um kind of

759
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:22,079
pushing just more nutrients in general

760
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,000
because we're going to go through more

761
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:25,599
of them. And then in the winter time,

762
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,519
just having a really light hand there,

763
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:30,158
just like getting them up to what I feel

764
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:33,119
like sufficiency is and trying to just

765
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:34,880
write it out and watch the plants.

766
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:36,719
Yeah, I know Bryant has talked about how

767
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:40,240
nitrogen availability, especially

768
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:42,480
outdoors, is is tied fairly closely with

769
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,720
temp with soil temperature and in

770
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,079
indoors even, I would assume in your

771
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,079
green houses, it's a little bit colder

772
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:49,599
in the winter than it is in the summer

773
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:53,119
naturally. And so, you probably would

774
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:55,759
have less nitrogen cycling. And um you

775
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:58,398
know, we routinely see soil tests where

776
00:27:55,759 --> 00:28:00,960
you're at, you know, one, two, three ppm

777
00:27:58,398 --> 00:28:03,678
of nit nitrate at the end of the cycle.

778
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,679
And conversely, those plants, it's like

779
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:07,600
I I know you left some yield on the

780
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:09,360
table and definitely some plant health

781
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:11,278
because the plant completely ran out of

782
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:14,079
nitrogen. So, hitting that sweet spot,

783
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:18,119
which I'd agree with you, 20 30 ppm is a

784
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:21,439
great finishing spot for for nitrates.

785
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:22,959
Um it makes a huge difference in overall

786
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,640
yield.

787
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,919
Yes. Yeah. I know, like you said, it's

788
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,360
kind of like it's threading that needle

789
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:29,360
where it's um you have to find that

790
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:30,678
balance to where you're not ending too

791
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:33,119
completely

792
00:28:30,679 --> 00:28:34,320
like just zapped out of nitrogen. Like

793
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:36,158
you have to end with a certain amount

794
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:37,839
still to where you're not getting you

795
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:39,120
don't ever or for me personally like I

796
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:41,038
don't ever want to see I want to see

797
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:42,479
actual natural scinessence from the

798
00:28:41,038 --> 00:28:44,640
plants where they are fading because of

799
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:47,440
their age and because of their maturity

800
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,960
level, not yellowing out because they're

801
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,240
depleted of nitrogen towards the end of

802
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,600
their cycle. We've definitely had

803
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,839
periods of that too where it's like

804
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:55,439
intense sun and everything and they they

805
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:57,359
process through that nutrient quicker

806
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:00,080
than we maybe expected them to and we

807
00:28:57,359 --> 00:29:01,439
start to see maybe instead of two weeks

808
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:03,278
before harvest where we start to see

809
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,278
color changes happen. We start to see

810
00:29:03,278 --> 00:29:07,679
that happen three or four weeks before

811
00:29:05,278 --> 00:29:09,278
like some yellowing start. Um and so

812
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:11,038
definitely figuring out over time like

813
00:29:09,278 --> 00:29:13,200
my initial first year here we had a lot

814
00:29:11,038 --> 00:29:14,879
of a lot of high nutrients, a lot of low

815
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:19,038
nutrients and it's just been trying to

816
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:21,520
slowly just bring that to balance. um

817
00:29:19,038 --> 00:29:23,359
over time. But yeah,

818
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:26,480
that's very that's very uh honest of you

819
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:28,000
to admit that. Yeah, it was it's a

820
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,679
learning process for sure. And anyone

821
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,440
that's like, "Oh, I for sure know the

822
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:34,559
100% correct way to do this." is

823
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:36,480
probably projecting a bit. But yeah,

824
00:29:34,558 --> 00:29:38,398
these soil tests are not always 100%

825
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,558
accurate, too. So, you kind of have to

826
00:29:38,398 --> 00:29:42,319
take them with a grain of salt. And I

827
00:29:40,558 --> 00:29:44,398
always like to air a little bit low

828
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:47,759
because you can always add more, but you

829
00:29:44,398 --> 00:29:49,519
can't really take away. So, yeah. What

830
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:51,599
is your approach if you know you are

831
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:53,359
midcycle and you realize that you're low

832
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:56,158
in and we can just stay with nitrogen

833
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:59,719
just to keep it simple. Um what's your

834
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:02,960
approach to combating that?

835
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:05,360
So especially for midcycle it's very

836
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:07,360
very like I'm being very cautious with

837
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:09,038
how much I'm trying to add um through

838
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:10,319
that. We add a bit through te's and

839
00:30:09,038 --> 00:30:11,839
stuff but it's it's a pretty small

840
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:15,038
amount so it's hard to account for too

841
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:17,199
much with that. Um but we've been more

842
00:30:15,038 --> 00:30:18,798
recently we worked with uh David Peron

843
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,720
um and he kind of introduced us to this

844
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:23,119
like whole slurry method of applying

845
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,839
nutrients down. So more recently um over

846
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:27,519
the summertime we had been

847
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:30,158
applying just with water through a pump

848
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:32,000
and through a hose um some nitrogen

849
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:33,679
early into flower like the first week of

850
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,919
flower or so if we felt like we needed

851
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:37,519
it to kind of give them that bump. But

852
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:39,440
it's really hard. there's a really short

853
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:42,079
window where once you're into flower,

854
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:45,200
you got a few weeks to where you can

855
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:47,519
amend and not be too far along into it.

856
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:50,319
So, it's a really kind of delicate time

857
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:51,918
frame for the plants. Um, typically it's

858
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:53,200
been in the past before we started doing

859
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,960
the slurries, it was just kind of like

860
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,840
top dressing some fish meal and stuff.

861
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:59,679
But again, that's

862
00:30:56,839 --> 00:31:01,678
like for me if if you're seeing if

863
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:03,278
you're seeing a deficiency and then

864
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:05,440
applying nutrients, it's almost too late

865
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:07,038
because for me, I feel like it's you're

866
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,278
waiting until you're seeing like kind of

867
00:31:07,038 --> 00:31:11,119
the uh the negative side effect of not

868
00:31:09,278 --> 00:31:12,880
having something before adjusting it.

869
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:14,719
And so, yeah, for the most part, I try

870
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,080
to stay like proactive rather than

871
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:19,000
reactive with that. But again, there's

872
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:21,199
the needle that you got to thread there.

873
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,798
Um, and then again, if you're top

874
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,319
dressing a nutrient, then it's you still

875
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:25,599
have to wait for that to break down,

876
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:26,960
become available to the plants. So,

877
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:28,558
there's still kind of even once you

878
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,159
amend, there's like a little few more

879
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:32,319
days at a minimum of time where it's

880
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:33,600
still not getting that yet. So, I think

881
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:35,359
the slurry has been really good as far

882
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:37,038
as just helping us kind of disperse our

883
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:39,759
nutrients a lot easier with a lot less

884
00:31:37,038 --> 00:31:42,158
like manual labor put into it. Um, as

885
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:44,558
far as our like flips go, our in between

886
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:46,159
cycles, um, kind of a remend process

887
00:31:44,558 --> 00:31:48,879
between cycles, we've taken that from

888
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:51,120
being like a four or five person job

889
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:54,240
that takes about the same amount of

890
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:55,518
hours down to a just me job that takes

891
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,399
about three hours. So, it's been really

892
00:31:55,519 --> 00:32:01,278
helpful in that regard. Um, and then

893
00:31:58,398 --> 00:32:03,439
obviously too kind of not exposing as

894
00:32:01,278 --> 00:32:04,798
many people to the dust and everything

895
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,798
that comes off of these. Like even if

896
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:09,359
you're wearing good PPE and everything,

897
00:32:06,798 --> 00:32:10,480
if you're exposing yourself to last

898
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:12,879
night and stuff like that on the

899
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,640
regular, it's not great for you. So

900
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,760
trying to kind of limit it's I'm

901
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,480
basically the only one working with

902
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:19,679
nutrients now. I know the proper PPE I

903
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,599
need to be wearing when I'm working with

904
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:24,399
them and everything. And so it's kind of

905
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:28,398
helped to simplify that a lot.

906
00:32:24,398 --> 00:32:30,079
That's that's great. So what does what

907
00:32:28,398 --> 00:32:32,719
does your process look like for

908
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:35,519
remending? Because you mentioned you you

909
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:37,519
top dress. Are you mixing the nutrients

910
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:39,519
into the soil when you remend or are you

911
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:41,519
top just top dressing them? How does the

912
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:44,480
slurry method describe that a little

913
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:47,278
more too and for people familiar? Yeah.

914
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,558
So, um, previous to using that method,

915
00:32:47,278 --> 00:32:49,919
we were just kind of applying the

916
00:32:48,558 --> 00:32:51,558
nutrients to the top of the soil and

917
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:53,759
then we would usually just kind of

918
00:32:51,558 --> 00:32:55,038
like we just call it like a scratching

919
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:56,079
them in basically where we're kind of

920
00:32:55,038 --> 00:32:57,679
trying to make sure we're not we're

921
00:32:56,079 --> 00:33:00,480
getting them mixed in with the top three

922
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:02,320
inches of the soil layer. Um, about once

923
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,679
a year we usually take some soil out and

924
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:05,439
add some Pete Moss back in or something

925
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:07,759
and then we'll do like a more of a full

926
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,960
like kind of till at that point. But for

927
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:10,398
the most part, we were just scratching

928
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,159
into the top surface making sure we

929
00:33:10,398 --> 00:33:14,639
weren't having things kind of cake up.

930
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:17,679
Um, with the slurry itself, it works

931
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:19,600
really good at kind of like dispersing

932
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:21,278
it on its own already. A lot of our

933
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:23,439
soluble nutrients just kind of get moved

934
00:33:21,278 --> 00:33:25,599
throughout the soil. Um, and then

935
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:27,200
there's a lot less. We again basically

936
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:28,879
just come by and scratch it into that

937
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,038
first little top layer after doing the

938
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,799
slurry amendment. Um, but for the

939
00:33:31,038 --> 00:33:35,919
process itself, it's kind of I get the

940
00:33:32,798 --> 00:33:37,918
soil test back. Um, go through, analyze

941
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:39,679
them, obviously like look at, right, do

942
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:41,038
I need to leech these beds first off

943
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:42,320
before anything else? if I don't need a

944
00:33:41,038 --> 00:33:44,319
leech or anything. If we're looking good

945
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:45,918
there, then it's looking at pH

946
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:47,200
adjustments or like soil structure

947
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:48,799
adjustments if we need to do anything

948
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,600
like adding any other media or anything

949
00:33:48,798 --> 00:33:53,000
to it. Um, and then kind of going down

950
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:56,158
and just looking

951
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,640
at our obviously our macronutrients, our

952
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:00,559
NPK, looking at calcium, magnesium,

953
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,480
sulfur, and everything. Um, those are

954
00:34:00,558 --> 00:34:03,519
the ones I'm like most focused on.

955
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:06,480
Obviously, those are the ones that have

956
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:08,760
the biggest impact. Um, really making

957
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:11,039
sure we sh up those holes.

958
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:12,560
Um, and also taking into account our

959
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:14,320
micronutrients and our trace minerals.

960
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:16,078
Those are just ones where I'm very wary

961
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,879
to make adjustments because you mess

962
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:22,359
that up and you mess the soil up. So,

963
00:34:18,878 --> 00:34:24,398
um, Absolutely. Yeah. So, and then,

964
00:34:22,358 --> 00:34:26,000
uh, kind of now what we've been doing

965
00:34:24,398 --> 00:34:27,118
recently too is adding a bit of biochar

966
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,639
in between each round, adding some

967
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:31,440
compost in between each round to try to

968
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:32,639
just add a little more back into the

969
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,679
soil from what we're taking out

970
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:37,358
throughout that cycle.

971
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:39,358
Couple questions. So, uh, question

972
00:34:37,358 --> 00:34:43,199
number one. If you're just scratching it

973
00:34:39,358 --> 00:34:44,719
in and not, uh, you know, well, I guess

974
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:46,078
we'll use the word tilling because,

975
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:48,319
yeah, that's what people are familiar

976
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:50,159
with. Um,

977
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,559
what about the bulk density of the soil?

978
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:54,398
So, over time with water, with

979
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:56,719
everything, that soil is compressing

980
00:34:54,398 --> 00:34:58,719
down. That's why when we, you know, if

981
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:59,759
you put soil out, fresh soil out in your

982
00:34:58,719 --> 00:35:01,199
garden bed at the beginning of this

983
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,800
garden season, you come back out the end

984
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:05,279
and it's dropped four inches and you're

985
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:07,920
like, where did that soil go? it's it's

986
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:10,000
compressing in bulk density which limits

987
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:12,880
the amount of air and water that the

988
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,079
pore space essentially in that soil. Do

989
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:17,599
you find that to be an issue at all with

990
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:21,119
uh your method or just you get like an

991
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:23,599
annual reset? We so with that we do kind

992
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:26,640
of a once a year we pull some soil add

993
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:28,240
some Pete moss typically back in um add

994
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:29,838
some irration in if we feel like we need

995
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:31,679
it and stuff too and then we do a big

996
00:35:29,838 --> 00:35:33,759
massive kind of full bed till that

997
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:35,039
usually helps up the soil volume just

998
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,880
from incorporating that air and

999
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:39,519
everything back into it and then we

1000
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:41,760
definitely do see like a settling um for

1001
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:43,199
the most part a lot of our like I'll use

1002
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,560
zones one and two for example those are

1003
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:46,960
the ones without the kiss soil those

1004
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:48,078
ones have been processed so much that at

1005
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,519
a certain point it almost looks like

1006
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:51,920
we're just growing in worms castings.

1007
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:54,960
So, we have a lot of kind of bigger pore

1008
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:56,800
space in those. Um, we definitely do see

1009
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:59,119
settling still and everything, but I

1010
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:01,280
feel like we reset it on a quick enough

1011
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:02,800
bas or on a regular enough basis to

1012
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,800
where we're not getting too many issues

1013
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,760
with large amount of compaction. Like,

1014
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,000
we're still getting good root

1015
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,280
penetration and everything. um still

1016
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,960
getting good water penetration and

1017
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,640
stuff, but it definitely it's definitely

1018
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,480
not ideal obviously to have like that

1019
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:16,319
that soil get super compact, but I feel

1020
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,159
like we're kind of on a good schedule to

1021
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,519
where

1022
00:36:17,159 --> 00:36:21,879
we're while balancing the amount of

1023
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:25,440
labor we're putting into it and also

1024
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:27,200
balancing kind of trying to not disturb

1025
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,400
too much of the soil structure since we

1026
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:31,118
do have a lot of fungus and everything

1027
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,720
growing within our beds. Um I feel like

1028
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:34,960
we're on a good middle ground of not

1029
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:36,559
fully like no till, but not fully

1030
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,760
complete till every time. So, kind of

1031
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:41,119
trying to shoot that gap where it's

1032
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:44,240
like do what's best for our soil

1033
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:46,400
structure and balance out also our labor

1034
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:49,598
costs and everything with it. And also

1035
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:51,760
trying to uh give the soil time to

1036
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:53,039
establish itself as kind of more of a

1037
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,599
obviously it's not the same as an

1038
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:58,000
outdoor soil but as more of an ecosystem

1039
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:59,440
within itself. Yeah. No, that makes

1040
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,679
sense. You don't want to disturb the

1041
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:04,559
microorganisms. I know that's the big

1042
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:06,960
reason people don't like to tilling or

1043
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:10,199
soil disturbance on any level. So, and

1044
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:12,320
I'm kind of I'm

1045
00:37:10,199 --> 00:37:14,399
like I'm in the middle on that because

1046
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,400
I'm not sure like how much it it it

1047
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,760
would take a lot of monitoring and

1048
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,200
testing things to see how much that

1049
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:22,240
actually messes with us. Like we would

1050
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:23,519
have to not till some beds till some

1051
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:24,799
beds and kind of see what happens over

1052
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:26,639
time. I definitely feel like we get

1053
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,920
better root penetration after we do our

1054
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:29,679
big turn and everything and after we

1055
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:31,280
lighten that soil up. Um, and I think

1056
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:33,279
it's good too just as far as like the

1057
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,160
stratification of our nutrients and

1058
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,920
everything in there because you don't

1059
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:37,199
want to get to the point where you have

1060
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,960
if you don't till it ever you're going

1061
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:40,399
to end up getting layers of nutrients

1062
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,838
that are more and less mobile than the

1063
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:44,480
other ones. And so I think it is good to

1064
00:37:41,838 --> 00:37:46,400
kind of just refresh the soil, mix that

1065
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:49,519
all back up and kind of redisperse all

1066
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:51,440
those nutrients as well.

1067
00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:54,880
Yeah, I mean I'm a big fan of soil

1068
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:56,480
disturbance as you probably know. Um, so

1069
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,800
we've t I've talked about it on this

1070
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,159
podcast. Um, I think these microbes are

1071
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:04,560
more resilient than people give them

1072
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:06,960
credit for. I do as well. Yeah. But I I

1073
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:09,519
see really happy plants in soil that is

1074
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:12,400
grown in noil indoor beds as well as

1075
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:13,759
soil that's been highly disturbed. So,

1076
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,440
um, I think there's a lot of ways to

1077
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,440
grow this plant. And, uh, I think you

1078
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:20,358
kind of bridge a good gap there of of

1079
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:22,800
kind of maybe addressing both ways. And

1080
00:38:20,358 --> 00:38:26,159
so now what you're doing, you're saying

1081
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:28,400
is uh maybe less soil disturbance

1082
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:30,559
because you're taking your soil

1083
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,920
recommendations that you've you've set

1084
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:34,320
based on your targets. You're taking

1085
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:37,760
that, you know, fish meal gypsum last

1086
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:41,838
night combo of inputs, putting them into

1087
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:44,720
like a giant vat, uh agitating it, and

1088
00:38:41,838 --> 00:38:47,358
then essentially just putting it all out

1089
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:50,239
with water in the form of a slurry over

1090
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:53,039
those beds. Is that accurate? Yeah,

1091
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:54,719
pretty accurate. Um, yeah. Yeah, that's

1092
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:56,079
that's essentially the process. And and

1093
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:57,838
through doing it, we've al obviously

1094
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:00,640
like I've found something some nutrients

1095
00:38:57,838 --> 00:39:02,320
work better with it, some don't. Like if

1096
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:04,480
I'm using soft rock phosphate, it's hard

1097
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,838
to get that to not settle on the bottom.

1098
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,519
Um there's definitely a carrying

1099
00:39:05,838 --> 00:39:08,920
capacity too for the size of the tanks

1100
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:11,599
that we have and

1101
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:13,039
um how many how much fertilizer we can

1102
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:16,079
put in with a certain amount of water.

1103
00:39:13,039 --> 00:39:17,679
So it's like been finding that out. Um,

1104
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:19,200
and again like like alpha alpha for

1105
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:20,719
example, we ended up just a lot of it

1106
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:22,239
would just kind of float to the top and

1107
00:39:20,719 --> 00:39:23,358
so then we wouldn't get very much. We

1108
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:25,118
would get a lot of like what looked like

1109
00:39:23,358 --> 00:39:26,719
alphalfpha stems coming out initially

1110
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:27,838
and then we would get no alphalfpha kind

1111
00:39:26,719 --> 00:39:29,199
of coming out for a while and then as

1112
00:39:27,838 --> 00:39:32,159
the tank emptied we'd start to get more

1113
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:33,279
of the kind of lighter material. So kind

1114
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:35,440
of going through that and figuring out

1115
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,880
which which nutrients are better for it

1116
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,639
and not. And there's some things that we

1117
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:41,358
apply like dry still like I apply rock

1118
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:42,799
dust um still just by like putting it

1119
00:39:41,358 --> 00:39:44,598
out dry and everything. And same with

1120
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,880
like if I am using soft rock phosphate.

1121
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:48,960
Um yeah. And so just kind of figuring

1122
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,400
out it's not it's not a full it's not

1123
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,838
like every single fertilizer is going to

1124
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,920
work great with it. And obviously we

1125
00:39:51,838 --> 00:39:55,679
could probably do some of our heavier

1126
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:58,480
amendments if we had less total

1127
00:39:55,679 --> 00:40:00,000
amendments in there with the water. Um

1128
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,838
yeah, for the most part that's it's been

1129
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,358
really helpful just being able to kind

1130
00:40:01,838 --> 00:40:05,759
of get that done a lot quicker. And

1131
00:40:03,358 --> 00:40:07,598
again, it's a I feel like it's a more

1132
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,920
even process as long as we have the

1133
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:11,440
appropriate agitation in our tanks. Um,

1134
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,559
it's been a trial and error process of

1135
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,320
just kind of figuring out it's like, all

1136
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:15,759
right, do I need one pump, two pumps

1137
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:17,440
during this? Which way do I need to

1138
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:21,119
orient them and like all the little

1139
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:22,480
things that go into that stuff?

1140
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,800
Yeah. So, you kind of addressed a couple

1141
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:27,039
of my questions like how do you some

1142
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,400
things just aren't great to use with

1143
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:29,920
this method and you have to plan

1144
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:32,079
separately. So, that that was question

1145
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,920
number one. Uh question number two was

1146
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:35,599
sort of like you said you feel like it's

1147
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:37,200
more even and in my head I was thinking

1148
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:40,720
about well if you're only taking one

1149
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:42,159
soil test then how would you know if

1150
00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:43,759
it's even or not for the you know

1151
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:46,159
aggregate for the whole room you

1152
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:48,320
wouldn't know if your fertility is even

1153
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:50,679
but I've also seen your rooms and your

1154
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:53,760
plants look very

1155
00:40:50,679 --> 00:40:55,279
uh evenly fertilized. I mean the they

1156
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,240
look very homogeneous in terms of the

1157
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,599
amount of fertility that they're

1158
00:40:56,239 --> 00:40:59,199
getting. I don't see like, oh, there's

1159
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:02,160
still a ton of potassium here and none

1160
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:05,118
over here based on plant response. So,

1161
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:07,440
it must be working. Um, how do you

1162
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:10,000
manage like uh how long do you water a

1163
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:11,358
certain bed? Like, do you just go do you

1164
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,239
count to five and then go to the next

1165
00:41:11,358 --> 00:41:16,318
bed and or next walk 10 steps or Yeah.

1166
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:19,598
How do you get that part of an even flow

1167
00:41:16,318 --> 00:41:21,679
rate out onto the bed? So, just watching

1168
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:23,519
we have a it's more just going by gallon

1169
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:25,440
markers on the tanks themselves. Um, and

1170
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:28,159
we're applying a lot. So, per row I'm

1171
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:31,280
applying about 100 gallons of water

1172
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:33,759
overall per row. Um, and those are the

1173
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:36,640
84 foot rows to 88 foot depending on

1174
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:38,240
which greenhouse we're in. Um, and so

1175
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:39,598
typically just checking back in making

1176
00:41:38,239 --> 00:41:41,279
seeing where my numbers at on that and

1177
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:43,280
everything. Um, and it definitely is not

1178
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,720
uh it's not 100% like I know I got

1179
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,319
exactly the same amount spread across

1180
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:47,919
the whole room, but it's just about kind

1181
00:41:46,318 --> 00:41:50,559
of minimizing as much difference as we

1182
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:52,880
can there. Um, yeah. And then just

1183
00:41:50,559 --> 00:41:54,078
making sure basically I'm going by the

1184
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:56,240
gallon numbers. is I've got a pretty

1185
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:57,599
consistent for the first two and a half

1186
00:41:56,239 --> 00:42:00,000
years for when I started here I was

1187
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:01,838
handwatering everything and I got pretty

1188
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,440
good pace down on my handwater whereas

1189
00:42:01,838 --> 00:42:06,159
like I move at about the same speed with

1190
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:08,318
everything. So it's uh just kind of

1191
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:09,759
keeping that same pace with it. Um

1192
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:14,079
making sure you're trying to distribute

1193
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:15,920
it as evenly as possible. Um yeah.

1194
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:17,359
So you're you're just finishing up with

1195
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,880
your tank right as you hit the end of

1196
00:42:17,358 --> 00:42:21,759
the row kind of at the the end of the

1197
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:25,760
bed. Yep. at the end. Uh, so I I use

1198
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:28,000
like one 250 galon or one 200-galon

1199
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:30,560
tank. Um, it's 250 gallons, but I

1200
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,280
usually fill it up to 200 per like two

1201
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:36,719
beds or two rows essentially. And so I

1202
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:38,240
can kind of do one up, one back on one

1203
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:39,598
row, and then one up, one back on the

1204
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:42,000
next row. And that's usually right about

1205
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:45,440
at the end of the 200. And that saves

1206
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:48,159
you a ton of time and labor. Tons. Yes.

1207
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:49,920
Application. Awesome. Well, cool. Yeah,

1208
00:42:48,159 --> 00:42:53,199
that's a very handy tip that people can

1209
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:55,280
experiment with. Yeah. Yeah, definitely

1210
00:42:53,199 --> 00:42:56,879
a lot of trial and error with it. Um, we

1211
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:58,240
have to use a giant hose for it, so

1212
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,519
that's that's one thing where if you try

1213
00:42:58,239 --> 00:43:01,519
to use a regular garden hose, I think

1214
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:02,960
you'd get it get clogged up pretty

1215
00:43:01,519 --> 00:43:04,239
easily. So, yeah, just finding the right

1216
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:06,559
equipment and everything. And then a

1217
00:43:04,239 --> 00:43:08,639
thing, we currently have like square

1218
00:43:06,559 --> 00:43:10,318
totes that we're doing it in. If I had

1219
00:43:08,639 --> 00:43:12,239
my my dream setup for it, it' probably

1220
00:43:10,318 --> 00:43:14,159
be a round tank just to help minimize

1221
00:43:12,239 --> 00:43:15,759
settling in corners and everything.

1222
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:17,559
Yeah. Um, but yeah, it's it's it's

1223
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:20,400
helped reduce a ton of labor.

1224
00:43:17,559 --> 00:43:22,000
Um, it's help and mostly for like the

1225
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,440
rest of the cultivation crew, all the

1226
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,559
guys that have to clean the greenhouse

1227
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,159
right after they just got done

1228
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:29,199
harvesting, got to pull root balls and

1229
00:43:26,159 --> 00:43:31,199
everything, that's already a very long

1230
00:43:29,199 --> 00:43:33,039
labor intensive process. So, if we can

1231
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:34,559
take away days a day of packing

1232
00:43:33,039 --> 00:43:37,358
nutrients and tilling beds, that's

1233
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:38,799
that's super helpful for them. Um, yeah,

1234
00:43:37,358 --> 00:43:41,279
so being able to take that kind of like

1235
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:42,720
off their plates and then I I I like

1236
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,480
having the control and it being able to

1237
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:47,199
apply it myself because at least then if

1238
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:48,800
something goes wrong, I did it. So, we

1239
00:43:47,199 --> 00:43:51,118
know we know what happened with it where

1240
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:52,640
in the past we've had like had some hot

1241
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:53,760
spots in beds where it's like some beds

1242
00:43:52,639 --> 00:43:56,239
are mixed really really well and then

1243
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:57,760
you find a whole pile of gypsum in one

1244
00:43:56,239 --> 00:43:59,679
bed that's just barely under the soil

1245
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:01,760
surface that's turned into a giant cake.

1246
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:04,239
So, yeah, make it just as far as a

1247
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:07,280
uniform application. Um, yeah, I feel

1248
00:44:04,239 --> 00:44:09,519
like it's really helpful.

1249
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:11,119
Awesome. Awesome. Well, I really

1250
00:44:09,519 --> 00:44:13,599
appreciate your your time today. Was

1251
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:16,000
there any other uh any other things you

1252
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:18,720
wanted to chat about here?

1253
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,519
for sure. Nothing that comes to mind too

1254
00:44:18,719 --> 00:44:22,639
much.

1255
00:44:20,519 --> 00:44:24,400
Um, yeah, I guess that's that's just

1256
00:44:22,639 --> 00:44:26,598
essentially kind of how the the process

1257
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:29,639
has developed over time.

1258
00:44:26,599 --> 00:44:32,400
Um, see anything else with

1259
00:44:29,639 --> 00:44:34,000
that? No, I guess I think that kind of

1260
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,519
covers it. We've um we've gone through

1261
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,199
different iterations of what we've been

1262
00:44:35,519 --> 00:44:38,440
doing. We've gone through I think the

1263
00:44:37,199 --> 00:44:41,358
main thing is just

1264
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:43,280
like trial and error is a very important

1265
00:44:41,358 --> 00:44:44,880
uh process of figuring out if you're

1266
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,400
doing things right. And like we varied

1267
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,760
all the way from like teeing, for

1268
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,280
example, at one point we were teeing

1269
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:51,599
once a week all the way down to only

1270
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:53,680
four times a cycle. And so just like

1271
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:55,599
figuring out having the freedom to be

1272
00:44:53,679 --> 00:44:56,879
able to like test different things and

1273
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:59,920
see what's working best for you and

1274
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:01,599
adjust it and not having kind of a like

1275
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,639
don't be stuck to one thing is I think

1276
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:05,280
the biggest thing that's been really

1277
00:45:02,639 --> 00:45:06,118
helpful for me. Um I feel like there's a

1278
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:08,560
lot

1279
00:45:06,119 --> 00:45:09,838
of there's a lot in the cannabis

1280
00:45:08,559 --> 00:45:12,400
industry where it's like you have to do

1281
00:45:09,838 --> 00:45:14,239
this this way or you're entirely wrong.

1282
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:15,519
Every single grow is different. There's

1283
00:45:14,239 --> 00:45:17,598
a thousand different ways to grow

1284
00:45:15,519 --> 00:45:20,318
plants. It all comes down to what is

1285
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:21,920
aligning with you ethically, what aligns

1286
00:45:20,318 --> 00:45:23,920
with your business and everything. And

1287
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:25,039
just um in your specific rooms

1288
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:27,599
themselves because again, if you're

1289
00:45:25,039 --> 00:45:29,519
growing under in a room with HPS's

1290
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:32,079
versus in a room with LEDs versus in a

1291
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:34,159
greenhouse with natural sun, like those

1292
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:36,400
are those by themselves, just light is

1293
00:45:34,159 --> 00:45:37,838
such a big change in environment that

1294
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,200
there is going to be a whole domino

1295
00:45:37,838 --> 00:45:41,838
effect of everything else. So just

1296
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:43,919
really having an open mind to kind of

1297
00:45:41,838 --> 00:45:45,119
tailoring your system to your specific

1298
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,800
growth I think is really really

1299
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:49,280
important and not being stuck on

1300
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,800
specific ideas.

1301
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:53,440
That did bring up two other questions

1302
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:55,760
that I had I want to get in before you

1303
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:57,760
sign off now. Uh you've brought up tease

1304
00:45:55,760 --> 00:46:01,680
a few times in this conversation. Can

1305
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:05,200
you just explain uh what that means?

1306
00:46:01,679 --> 00:46:08,000
Yeah, so just a micro tea. So just um

1307
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:11,679
essentially mixing we use a mix of worm

1308
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:14,000
castings and uh compost mixing those

1309
00:46:11,679 --> 00:46:16,078
with water a food source we use molasses

1310
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,480
so like a sugar source. I typically add

1311
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:20,640
in some hydraulicate just to help with

1312
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:22,318
kind of the bubbling and everything. Um

1313
00:46:20,639 --> 00:46:24,318
as well and food for the microbes as

1314
00:46:22,318 --> 00:46:26,960
well and then some kelp and alalfa. And

1315
00:46:24,318 --> 00:46:29,199
essentially the idea is we're taking the

1316
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:30,960
microbes from our compost and from our

1317
00:46:29,199 --> 00:46:32,639
worm castings. We're giving them a food

1318
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:35,039
source. We're airrating them in a liquid

1319
00:46:32,639 --> 00:46:36,639
to help them just reproduce kind of up

1320
00:46:35,039 --> 00:46:38,639
the concentration of how many microbes

1321
00:46:36,639 --> 00:46:40,318
we have in that tea and then we're

1322
00:46:38,639 --> 00:46:42,960
watering it into the into the beds to

1323
00:46:40,318 --> 00:46:45,119
help apply it into the beds to help

1324
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:46,480
speed up our process of uh kind of

1325
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:48,160
cycling our nutrients and everything and

1326
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:50,719
make them more plant available. And

1327
00:46:48,159 --> 00:46:53,199
again, we've gone I'm not still not sure

1328
00:46:50,719 --> 00:46:54,399
what the right right ratio is to how

1329
00:46:53,199 --> 00:46:56,960
many you're doing throughout a cycle,

1330
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:58,559
but we've gone everything from once a

1331
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:00,760
week when I first started down to like

1332
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:03,519
four times a cycle and just kind

1333
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:05,119
of been messing with that and testing it

1334
00:47:03,519 --> 00:47:06,719
and seeing how we've also changed tea

1335
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:08,559
recipes, but just uh messing with it and

1336
00:47:06,719 --> 00:47:10,799
seeing like what that affects in the

1337
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:12,480
plants. Um yeah, so just basically

1338
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:14,160
giving the plants a boost of microbes to

1339
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:16,559
help kind of process those nutrients in

1340
00:47:14,159 --> 00:47:18,559
the soil a little quicker.

1341
00:47:16,559 --> 00:47:21,838
So, you're making uh airrated compost

1342
00:47:18,559 --> 00:47:24,159
tees. Yes. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. And uh

1343
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:26,239
long-winded way of saying it. Yeah. No,

1344
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:28,078
I people might not be familiar with the

1345
00:47:26,239 --> 00:47:30,239
term or the difference between that and

1346
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:33,280
say a compost extract. I'm literally

1347
00:47:30,239 --> 00:47:35,279
staring at my microscope here. And uh

1348
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:37,280
don't let me forget when I come out for

1349
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:38,800
the conference, if I drive out in

1350
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:40,880
September for the conference that we're

1351
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:43,200
putting on at your facility, I will

1352
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:46,559
bring my microscope and we can uh look

1353
00:47:43,199 --> 00:47:48,318
at the TE's and uh maybe make some make

1354
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:49,920
some recipe adjustments at that point,

1355
00:47:48,318 --> 00:47:51,519
too. Yeah. See what's No, that'd be

1356
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:53,358
great because Yeah, because again, it's

1357
00:47:51,519 --> 00:47:54,480
uh we think we're doing the right thing.

1358
00:47:53,358 --> 00:47:56,078
We hope we're doing the right thing by

1359
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:57,599
applying the TE's, but unless you scope

1360
00:47:56,079 --> 00:48:00,160
it and are able to actually identify

1361
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:01,760
what's in there, it's kind of it's kind

1362
00:48:00,159 --> 00:48:03,838
of a mystery. So, yeah, that'd be that'd

1363
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:06,000
be helpful. That'd be fun. All right.

1364
00:48:03,838 --> 00:48:07,400
Well, hey, thanks again, Jared. Oh, last

1365
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,239
question.

1366
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:14,079
Uh, you disappeared. Oh, you're still

1367
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:17,078
there. Oh, you're back. Okay. Okay. Um,

1368
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:20,480
last question was, uh, your outdoor

1369
00:48:17,079 --> 00:48:22,318
runs. Um, yes. Yeah. You guys do those

1370
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:24,559
in you handle your fertility a little

1371
00:48:22,318 --> 00:48:26,239
different on those, right? Yes. Yeah.

1372
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:27,839
Yeah, for sure. Omin. It really depends

1373
00:48:26,239 --> 00:48:30,799
on which zone we're in outside because

1374
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:33,279
we have we have everything from plants

1375
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:35,519
in pots to plants in beds that have

1376
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:36,960
soilless media on top of the soil in the

1377
00:48:35,519 --> 00:48:39,759
ground and then all the way to just

1378
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:42,159
growing in the field um in just straight

1379
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:44,720
up soil. So yeah, we kind of tailor it

1380
00:48:42,159 --> 00:48:46,879
to each zone. Um we test all those as

1381
00:48:44,719 --> 00:48:48,159
well. Um yeah, definitely kind of

1382
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:50,480
approaching the amendments differently

1383
00:48:48,159 --> 00:48:52,719
there. I'm upping my nitrogen quite a

1384
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:54,358
bit since we are in like a full sun,

1385
00:48:52,719 --> 00:48:56,799
full season setting.

1386
00:48:54,358 --> 00:48:58,880
Um but again that's kind of determined

1387
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:00,720
by our pot size too. With some of our if

1388
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:02,480
we're growing in 25 gallon pots, we end

1389
00:49:00,719 --> 00:49:05,039
up having to feed them a little more

1390
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:07,280
often throughout the cycle. But um with

1391
00:49:05,039 --> 00:49:08,558
our inbed plants and with our inground

1392
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:10,960
plants, we can usually get through the

1393
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:12,720
season off of one kind of initial

1394
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:15,318
feeding and then just monitoring them

1395
00:49:12,719 --> 00:49:18,159
from then on. But yeah, definitely

1396
00:49:15,318 --> 00:49:20,318
um definitely upping our fertility

1397
00:49:18,159 --> 00:49:22,078
overall with a focus on upping our

1398
00:49:20,318 --> 00:49:24,558
nitrogen to kind of the high end of what

1399
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:26,079
I would ever apply. And uh yeah, it's

1400
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:27,599
been it's been we're dialing things in

1401
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:29,119
still, but it's it's been working well.

1402
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:31,760
We've been getting getting better crops

1403
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:34,160
each year. So, now that we're growing uh

1404
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:37,280
we're growing kind of a big a big field

1405
00:49:34,159 --> 00:49:38,318
of autoflowers, um definitely have to

1406
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,359
treat those a little bit differently

1407
00:49:38,318 --> 00:49:40,960
than everything else because they're

1408
00:49:39,358 --> 00:49:42,400
kind of queuing into flower immediately.

1409
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:44,720
So, it's not necessar you don't

1410
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:46,160
necessarily need as much of the

1411
00:49:44,719 --> 00:49:49,199
nutrients you'd be focusing on for like

1412
00:49:46,159 --> 00:49:51,440
a longer veg period. Um and then also,

1413
00:49:49,199 --> 00:49:53,519
we're amending soil. So I got to take in

1414
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:56,400
to take into account the cation exchange

1415
00:49:53,519 --> 00:49:58,239
capacity. The organic matter is actual

1416
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:00,400
organic matter in this case where it's

1417
00:49:58,239 --> 00:50:01,919
been broken down over thousands of years

1418
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:06,000
not just like organic matter in the form

1419
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:07,559
of pete. Um but yeah so a lot more to

1420
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:11,358
take into account with the outdoor soils

1421
00:50:07,559 --> 00:50:12,960
but yeah kind of same process still.

1422
00:50:11,358 --> 00:50:14,719
Nice. I just I remember coming out and

1423
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:18,280
seeing your outdoor plants and they

1424
00:50:14,719 --> 00:50:18,279
looked uh phenomen

1425
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:23,440
they got too big. Yeah, it was uh it was

1426
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:24,960
fun to see though. So, awesome. Well,

1427
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:27,440
thank you so much for your time. I

1428
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:28,880
really appreciate uh on the show. We'll

1429
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:32,318
talk soon. No, I appreciate it. Yeah,

1430
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:32,318
thank you. See you soon. Yes.
