00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:30,279
growing from a science-based perspective

7
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:31,840

podcast I wanted to let listeners know

11
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:39,558
of a couple of things first off we have

12
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:41,479
a new Bloom booster that we've been

13
00:00:39,558 --> 00:00:44,159
formulating and testing for the past 2

14
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:45,799
years it's now available on our website

15
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:48,198
and is the cleanest organic Bloom

16
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:50,319
booster on the market we also have a new

17
00:00:48,198 --> 00:00:52,439
soil blend using a new compost Source

18
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,679
from SE Coast compost that is the lowest

19
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:56,640
heavy metals with the highest fertility

20
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:59,079
and beneficial biology of any of our

21
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,878
mixes so if you're in a tight regulatory

22
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:04,079
State please reach out because I think

23

YouTube I highly suggest checking it out

48
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,520
it's one of the nicest facilities I've

49
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:59,920
ever seen in person and I'm honored that

50
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:02,399
they've been using our soils in their

51
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,118
green houses for over a few years now

52
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,359

like to see the facility that we're

61
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:27,560
talking about we did put out a YouTube

62
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,360
video last year when I got to tour the

63
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,239
facility in person that's on YouTube

64
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,720
already can just search for it and it's

65
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:38,000
a it's a great uh example of a wonderful

66
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:39,439
Greenhouse operation in Montana but all

67
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,080
right Adam take it away tell me a little

68
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:43,120
bit about uh Collective

69
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:46,080
elevation yeah Collective elevation

70
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,080
we're um the largest living soil

71
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,800
facility in Montana probably one of the

72
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,959
largest cultivation facilities

73
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,000
singularly we are the largest

74
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:59,400
cultivation facility in Montana and

75
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:02,400
um we evolved from in the early days of

76
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:05,680
Montana medical program like 2011 and 12

77
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:09,039
we were um my business partner was a

78
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:11,400
hydr grower and I was a living soil hoop

79
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:13,560
house off-grid grower I had a place out

80
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:17,080
in the boonies that was just all solar

81
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,598
powered and we when we started our first

82
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,680
Dispensary after a couple years of

83
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:24,679
knowing each other we basically saw that

84
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,879
uh my style was producing more Cannabis

85
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,159
Cup winners we were actually winning

86
00:03:25,878 --> 00:03:30,560
more Awards with the living soil and

87
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:32,919
off-grid approach than we were with like

88
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:36,280
uh fancy dosatrons and and hydro and

89
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:37,958
salt-based systems and then also it was

90
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:40,759
just far more profitable as well so we

91
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:43,039
had kind of like stumbled upon this um

92
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:44,959
one of these rare win-win wins in the

93
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:47,039
world of that doesn't happen very much

94
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,759
in business where it's uh something is a

95
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:51,120
better product that's better for the

96
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:54,239
planet and once you have a knowledgeable

97
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,200
group of uh or a team you've got

98
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,920
something that's also cheaper to produce

99
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:59,958
and that just that's we stumbled upon

100
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:02,039
something that was uh yeah like said

101
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:06,079
rare in business and so we kind of ran

102
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:07,759
with it um and as we bought this new

103
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:09,159
facility I I also did see the

104
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:11,560
limitations of having an off-grid

105
00:04:09,158 --> 00:04:13,280
facility you can't really run year round

106
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:16,160
you can't have beautiful mom rooms you

107
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,399
can't you just as much as we want to be

108
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,600
sustainable you got to have proper

109
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:22,959
electricity and a and connection to the

110
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:26,280
grid uh also I needed to be closer to

111
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:27,918
town to have access to labor so that I

112
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:29,478
could build the team of my dreams so

113
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:32,159
that it wasn't just all on my shoulders

114
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:35,519
and just you know stoking wood stove so

115
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:39,840
basically in 2012 2013 I was stoking

116
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:43,240
wood stoves at midnight 3:00 a.m. 6:00

117
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:45,399
a.m. in the fall running a trim crew all

118
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,280
day you know working 16 hour days with

119
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:49,679
breaks and and the whole time I was just

120
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:51,599
like daydreaming about my dream

121
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,800
Greenhouse we knew that utilizing the

122
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,080
sun uh especially in Montana and the

123
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,439
summer it has huge benefits to not only

124
00:04:56,079 --> 00:05:00,599
like you know turpine profiles and

125
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:03,719
quality but also from a a electricity

126
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:07,160
cost so having that

127
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,320
off-grid background really put some

128
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,280
ideas in my head but I was just

129
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:11,519
daydreaming of my dream facility you

130
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:13,559
know how am I going to build it it's

131
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:15,319
going to be run from an app I'll be able

132
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,720
to control everything from my phone

133
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:19,879
which led us to this Wadsworth system

134
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:22,199
I'll have a team that I can rely on that

135
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:24,319
has a specialist in every category and

136
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:27,199
basically I was daydreaming and planning

137
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:30,199
um my dream facility while working way

138
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:34,000
way too many hours in the old days and

139
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:36,840
in 2017 the Cannabis industry in Montana

140
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
changed such that you had to have a

141
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:42,198
dispensary and produce everything on

142
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,600
your own you couldn't do any um third

143
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:47,120
party uh sales or anything like that and

144
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,479
also they forced us to basically have to

145
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,360
have a dispensary if we're going to have

146
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:52,560
a grow so we started our first

147
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,520
dispensary um that year there was also a

148
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,439
Cannabis Cup uh where we entered a bunch

149
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:59,680
of our products in the Montana State

150
00:05:56,439 --> 00:06:02,199
providers cup and we really dominated

151
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,879
that particular competition and uh the

152
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:07,160
the rest is kind of History it also

153
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:09,360
reset the industry in that the biggest

154
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,000
providers in the state at that time got

155
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,240
set back to three patients there was

156
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,879
some court cases and

157
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:18,360
essentially us little guys and the big

158
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:20,038
guys all got set back to the Finish or

159
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,038
to the start line again and we got to

160
00:06:20,038 --> 00:06:24,439
all start with three patients and once

161
00:06:22,038 --> 00:06:27,439
that court case went through the people

162
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:28,918
who had a 5year head start on me were

163
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:30,800
down to the same amount of patients as

164
00:06:28,918 --> 00:06:33,000
me and and we were Off to the Races and

165
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,598
we had a you know really good product

166
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,038
and that ended up being one of the best

167
00:06:35,598 --> 00:06:41,120
jump starts for our our business to be

168
00:06:38,038 --> 00:06:43,680
able to build so we also bought a 38

169
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,560
acre property here in Boseman that year

170
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,560
and started designing it from scratch

171
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:50,199
the very first Greenhouse we built was

172
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:52,478
just um treated lumber and kind of a

173
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:53,759
little house style that we that had

174
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:55,918
worked really well as far as light

175
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,520
deprivation manual light tarping on on

176
00:06:55,918 --> 00:07:00,598
my old farm and we built that to tide us

177
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:04,680
over while we brought power in and did

178
00:07:00,598 --> 00:07:06,279
everything and I started working on

179
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,840
getting a hold of Nexus which was our

180
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:10,638
first uh automated light depth system

181
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:13,638
green houses and Nexus were the first

182
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:16,160
two and now we've got two 3,000 ft

183
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:18,319
nexuses or 12,000 ft Nexus facility and

184
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,639
we've got another 12,000 ft NextGen

185
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:23,400
facility that we built in

186
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:25,918
2021 and we basically just started

187
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:28,159
building and because we were on a budget

188
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:31,478
and we had to build the first 3,000 ft

189
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:34,400
greenhouse and a uh mom room and

190
00:07:31,478 --> 00:07:38,839
Warehouse head house connected to it

191
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:40,598
that forced us to design as we went and

192
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:42,519
while in many ways that was a hindrance

193
00:07:40,598 --> 00:07:43,918
because we had to build on a budget in

194
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:46,359
other ways we were able to learn a lot

195
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:48,639
of lessons as we uh expanded our

196
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:51,158
facility and we did actually leave our

197
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:53,598
footprint um blank enough that we could

198
00:07:51,158 --> 00:07:55,120
expand into it and yet learn from our

199
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:56,360
mistakes as we went and that was a huge

200
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:00,360
benefit because if you would have given

201
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:02,479
me $8 million in 2018 and said hey build

202
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,840
out this facility today I think I would

203
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:05,598
have made a lot more mistakes it was

204
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:08,478
actually a really big benefit for us to

205
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:10,560
just um build and design and evolve as

206
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:12,199
we go um so first we started building

207
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:16,038
the facility at the same time we started

208
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:18,720
building our team and the dream facility

209
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:20,038
coupled with what is now the Dream Team

210
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,159
you know the first one of the first

211
00:08:20,038 --> 00:08:24,519
employees I ever hired was Danny uh on

212
00:08:22,158 --> 00:08:26,439
the cultivation side and you know you've

213
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:29,240
met Danny you know his ability to

214
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:31,158
innovate and design and you know he

215
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:33,080
picked up where I left off as far as I

216
00:08:31,158 --> 00:08:34,718
had lots of great ideas but my welding

217
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,719
skills were maybe a little weak or my

218
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:39,399
ability to form unistra

219
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,800
into anything in the world so like that

220
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:48,200
was the beginning of like the Dream Team

221
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:49,958
and as we moved on we grew and hired on

222
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,320
at the time it wasn't even Specialists

223
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:53,759
what we really learned from that was in

224
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,360
many ways it's better to have a blank

225
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:59,159
slate somebody without a ton of grow

226
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,959
experience um because a lot of times all

227
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:03,000
they've built is bad habits especially

228
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:05,199
in the days of misinformation and you

229
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,200
know big ego and bad habits don't make

230
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:11,519
for

231
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:15,519
um receptive uh Innovative team a good

232
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:17,720
team is one that is humble and can um

233
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,399
see the error of their ways or change

234
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:22,200
their minds when presented with new

235
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:24,399
information and so uh not that we don't

236
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,560
have some Growers uh some experienced

237
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:29,839
Growers on the team but a lot of

238
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:32,479
them they had that that quality of uh

239
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,880
humility and and willingness to learn

240
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,399
and change especially because a lot of

241
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:37,799
them came from the hydro background with

242
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:41,679
that being said they also brought some

243
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:44,479
good Innovation to my side to from a uh

244
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:45,799
dosatrons and plumbing and you know

245
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:51,560
basically

246
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:53,838
having good uh Sops and some cleanliness

247
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:57,078
and some some facility management system

248
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:59,399
so I guess that really helped form the

249
00:09:57,078 --> 00:10:01,799
Dream Team uh there was a short period

250
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:03,720
where I was getting some good employees

251
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:05,759
from another facility that ran a pretty

252
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,040
tight ship but uh at the time my motto

253
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:08,759
was you train them we retain them

254
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:11,958
because we were nicer people and and a

255
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:15,360
lot of people really enjoyed the enjoyed

256
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:17,159
the uh living soil concept and even just

257
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,759
not working in indoor rooms which at

258
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:20,879
that time was all High Press sodium you

259
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:22,838
know what I mean like it it messes with

260
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:26,039
your eyes it's not as fun versus on a

261
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:28,440
nice on a 40 below winter day when it's

262
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:30,399
cloudy being in a nice Greenhouse or or

263
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:34,720
sunny for that matter and being at 80°

264
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:36,799
is wonderful and also on a 95° summer

265
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,360
day like today my team's in there and

266
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:41,120
it's 78 degrees and both of those things

267
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,680
are kind of just it's it's nice they

268
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,360
they appreciate working in living soil

269
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:47,479
working the way these plants have

270
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:49,919
evolved so

271
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,039
yeah well you dropped a lot of gems

272
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:53,120
there that I want to go back and

273
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:56,759
highlight uh first off though big shout

274
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,200
out to Danny he uh he's amazing um I'm

275
00:10:56,759 --> 00:11:00,480
so glad he's part of your team it was

276
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:02,399
wonderful to meet him and you uh both of

277
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,600
your Innovation and what you guys have

278
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:08,278
brought to this to Collective elevation

279
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:10,040
is really really fun to see and uh I

280
00:11:08,278 --> 00:11:11,639
want to highlight a couple things that

281
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:13,439
you mentioned in there that I think

282
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:15,959
listeners really should should pay

283
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,320
attention to the first being uh that you

284
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:21,759
said that you built out the facility as

285
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:23,639
you went um I think that is huge because

286
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:25,439
you know when I built out my farm

287
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:27,360
granted it was a a little bit different

288
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,519
type of farm you know we were doing we

289
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,919
had an edible nursery and we did have a

290
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,759
greenhouse and things like that um I

291
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:35,719
made a ton of mistakes because it was my

292
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:39,039
first time doing it and there are a lot

293
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:42,920
of things that we learned that first

294
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:45,799
iteration that as we grew I was able to

295
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:47,958
improve on and I see a lot of facilities

296
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:50,359
that want to go big and they have these

297
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:52,919
massive you know aspirations which is

298
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:55,320
awesome um but they try to do it too

299
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:57,559
fast and I think starting small and

300
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:59,480
scaling as you learn where your pinch

301
00:11:57,559 --> 00:12:01,078
points are and where you know mistakes

302
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,320
happen and there's there's so many I can

303
00:12:01,078 --> 00:12:06,239
think of and I'm sure you probably have

304
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:08,800
a pretty long list too um I I think

305
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,560
that's a really good idea trial

306
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:12,439
something you may find that living soil

307
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:14,479
is not the way that you want to grow

308
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,480
because of you know for some reason or

309
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,839
another or you may find that uh you know

310
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,079
you set have a whole facility for

311
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,560
Hydroponics and then decide to go an

312
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:24,278
entirely different method of growing and

313
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:26,879
now a lot of your equipment is obsolete

314
00:12:24,278 --> 00:12:28,240
you know I've seen that more than once

315
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:30,000
too you know where these places will

316
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,839
have hundreds of thousands or even

317
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,159
millions of dollars worth of obsolete

318
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,920
equipment because they completely

319
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:37,240
changed the technology and the way they

320
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:38,479
were growing so I think that's a really

321
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:42,600
good point did you want to add anything

322
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:44,039
to that yeah I think that um two things

323
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,839
we also built the facility when the

324
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:49,278
gting was good in the Cannabis industry

325
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:51,360
it was very profitable from 2017 to 2020

326
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:53,399
ironically during the medical days and

327
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,120
because my goal wasn't to make a million

328
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:57,078
dollars my goal was to design my dream

329
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,799
facility because I was passionate about

330
00:12:57,078 --> 00:13:01,399
cannabis that that was a perfect

331
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:04,240
combination of like not being some

332
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:06,519
corporate entity I wanted the best

333
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,278
Greenhouse facility in the world that's

334
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:10,120
that's literally was the core driver

335
00:13:08,278 --> 00:13:12,639
more than yeah more than money or

336
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:14,440
anything else just so we could get the

337
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,039
perfect facility and and so that we

338
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,920
could grow so that basically we could

339
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:20,519
scale without ever sacrificing quality

340
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:24,120
because I knew there was some like happy

341
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:26,120
medium there and um another thing that

342
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:28,720
really helped was I have an old living

343
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:32,720
soil facility shop that's kind of my

344
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:36,199
beater car my R&amp;D facility and that has

345
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:38,000
really uh helped a lot in that I've

346
00:13:36,198 --> 00:13:39,919
never bought anything or enacted

347
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,600
anything large scale at the farm because

348
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:43,399
it's very expensive to make mistakes or

349
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,680
convert over or you don't even get good

350
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:48,399
accurate tests but I have some of the

351
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:50,120
first uh Grassroots living soil 4x4 beds

352
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:54,159
that they ever made went into that

353
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:56,639
facility in 2016 or 15

354
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:59,159
and that was of the first tester of

355
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:01,879
going from uh pots or inground wooden

356
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:03,919
beds to you know like Grassroots fabric

357
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:05,799
beds and that helped like oh well what

358
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:07,319
if we had a liner on here so that it

359
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:08,919
didn't dry out on the edges so much and

360
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:11,240
that helped we can give feedback to

361
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:12,838
these companies so there's a lot of same

362
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,720
with LED lights we never bought a single

363
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:16,720
LED light without first running a light

364
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,720
in my for light rooms so I have seven

365
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:22,240
forl light rooms there and being able to

366
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:24,040
test any new things and I don't care if

367
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,839
That's genetics we never brought new

368
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:28,319
genetics we we never took clones into

369
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,040
the farm uh in the old days even now I

370
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:33,040
Almost Do all feno hunting but we make

371
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:34,679
seeds there we make fenos hunting we do

372
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:36,559
all our feno hunting there if we get new

373
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:38,679
lights we test them there on a small

374
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:42,119
scale if we get new beds new soil

375
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:44,679
additions um new microbial products

376
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:47,639
literally everything is tested at that

377
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:50,319
R&amp;D facility uh first and that is fully

378
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:52,839
indoors so it's a little bit more um

379
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,720
less subject to seasonal variations and

380
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:57,680
and stuff like that so it really gives

381
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,879
you a good control and by no means are

382
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:02,479
we uh Advanced science scientists but

383
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:05,000
it's amazing what you can do with just

384
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,800
experimental room and and it's you know

385
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
it's it's cheap like I said it's the

386
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:10,519
beater car that we try everything before

387
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,600
we bring it to the farm and that's every

388
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:14,320
every single strain that's helped our

389
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,879
facility so

390
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:20,360
much I love that so it's functioning as

391
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:22,559
an R&amp;D space for you to trial anything

392
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:25,120
um I was just on the phone yesterday

393
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:29,359
with a a grower in Michigan and they

394
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:33,240
were getting some uh 250 gallon totes of

395
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:36,680
hydrate and one tote allows them to do

396
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:40,560
two applications on their plants uh on

397
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:42,599
scale it's expensive um to enact

398
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:43,919
something so you have to really and I

399
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,560
realize if you're a home grower in a

400
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:49,240
tent you know like the cost per plant is

401
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:51,679
is not as much of a factor but I think

402
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:54,639
thinking about this in the same manner

403
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:56,479
allows you to be more efficient um you

404
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,560
know you can spend your money spend your

405
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,959
time doing other things and maybe those

406
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:02,679
other things or scouting your plants um

407
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:04,879
or maybe it's just enjoying your room

408
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:06,239
but um having to spend your time on

409
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:09,919
labor doing things that you don't

410
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:11,720
necessarily want to do um you know or or

411
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:14,719
having to make more applications of

412
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:16,160
whatever is is time and on scale I know

413
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,120
especially for you that just doesn't

414
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:21,039
work so having testing things out and

415
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,240
then also having a quarantine space

416
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:24,439
essentially is what you're using that

417
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:27,000
for for all genetics and things like

418
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:30,199
that is is an awesome suggestion we

419
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,759
recommend it to every facility I look at

420
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:34,479
when I see a design like where where is

421
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:37,159
your your you know your quarantine space

422
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:40,680
um and offsite is even better so that's

423
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:41,679
that's a really good point um the other

424
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:43,198
thing I want to highlight is you

425
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:45,799
mentioned that you like hiring blank

426
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:47,679
slates and I I love that I think getting

427
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:49,599
people with a Horticultural or botney

428
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:52,879
background but maybe not in cannabis

429
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:55,920
allows you to really uh shape them to

430
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:57,838
what uh you know what you want what your

431
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:59,679
goal or vision is at Collective because

432
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,000
I see too many ego in this industry

433
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:03,639
where people come in and they they want

434
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,199
to change things and add a lot of

435
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:08,720
variables and uh it makes it challenging

436
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,558
I think I think we can all learn from

437
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,679
each other but at the same time you know

438
00:17:11,558 --> 00:17:16,318
they've got to be able to enact your

439
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:21,038
vision you know in a in a with a

440
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:22,798
positive attitude yeah y 100% that's

441
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:25,359
that's been crucial building that team

442
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:27,679
and and when you build that team even

443
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:29,759
having uh We've we've over the last few

444
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,798
years become an EOS company which is uh

445
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:32,599
that's more of a business thing

446
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:34,279
entrepreneurial operating system it's an

447
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:36,918
operating system for our business and

448
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:39,038
that that highlights a first of all

449
00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:40,919
there's a accountability chart so that

450
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:42,919
it lines out who's in charge of what

451
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:45,440
particular task uh within the facility

452
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:47,038
because you don't get to this scale uh

453
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,840
by running everything yourself or being

454
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:51,240
able to uh micromanage every single

455
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:54,000
aspect at a certain point you have to

456
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:55,400
trust people and even if you trust them

457
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,919
and they're amazing you still need to

458
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:00,960
have a really good outline of their

459
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:01,799
expectations and duties and one of the

460
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,600
first things you do on that

461
00:18:01,798 --> 00:18:04,759
accountability chart is you you write

462
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:06,240
out the seat you write out all the

463
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:08,759
duties associated with that seat and

464
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:11,480
then you find out does this person uh

465
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:13,759
get it want it and have the capacity to

466
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:16,200
do that particular task and if they

467
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:17,919
don't then what you have is a sacred cow

468
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,360
um and when you get to that sacred cow

469
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,880
mentality you know like too many sacred

470
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:23,479
cows that are basically not contributing

471
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:25,039
to the greater good not on the same path

472
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:27,679
and then also getting your team to

473
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:29,599
actually understand what your one three

474
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,519
and five year goals as a company are cuz

475
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:33,359
so many people they're just winging it

476
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:35,639
they're just out here surviving and and

477
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:37,639
I don't blame them because compliance

478
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:40,159
and economics and taxes it beats you

479
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:42,559
down I spend I I mean all I want to do

480
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:45,280
is go grow cannabis too and I spend 80%

481
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:47,440
of my time now doing meetings with

482
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:49,678
accountants and and you know but and my

483
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:53,000
team as well um but we have five

484
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:54,840
dispensaries and a lot of my stuff even

485
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,839
though where I came from as cannabis and

486
00:18:54,839 --> 00:19:01,158
growing is now business and Retail and

487
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:04,240
really stuff that it's hard for me to be

488
00:19:01,159 --> 00:19:07,960
passionate about so building out that

489
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:09,640
team um showing them what you expect and

490
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,960
that so many people are so used to like

491
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,559
oh I came from this other girl and we

492
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,360
just do dabs all day where's your dab

493
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:17,240
table are you kidding me no there's no

494
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:19,279
smoking in this facility we're we are a

495
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:22,400
a lean mean professional machine and

496
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:24,399
that's you don't become the best by like

497
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,960
just kind of limping your way through

498
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:30,000
life so like actually having high

499
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:33,480
expectations and uh duties and

500
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,440
putting people uh pairing their skills

501
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:37,839
with the seat in your company and when

502
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:40,200
it's small when you have good people

503
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:42,959
they have uh awesome positions to grow

504
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:45,120
into and as you get bigger then you know

505
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,960
all those seats are dialed all their

506
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:49,038
expectations are there but just like

507
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,759
having a little bit of intention and

508
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:53,519
getting your entire team paddling in the

509
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:55,319
right direction um you know and and at

510
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:57,879
any given time they actually know like

511
00:19:55,319 --> 00:20:00,798
what our plan is and what our goals are

512
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:03,640
what our mission is a company is and um

513
00:20:00,798 --> 00:20:04,720
what our values are and that no matter

514
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,280
what happens we're not going to break

515
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,480
our ethics we are a living soil

516
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:11,359
sustainable organic facility

517
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:14,440
so everything else being equal we don't

518
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:16,479
break that we don't um any time where

519
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:18,919
there's a cost benefit analysis run and

520
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:21,798
maybe there's something that's real

521
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:23,720
questionable whether it's um really

522
00:20:21,798 --> 00:20:25,359
worth it ties always going to go to

523
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:27,159
sustainability in the environment if

524
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:30,759
we're using you know these new cubes

525
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:32,159
that we trial and we get 5% better

526
00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:33,599
results out of them this like PR

527
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,640
preforma cubes which we've been recently

528
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:36,959
running the side by side with they are

529
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,840
they're great they're pre-charge are

530
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,759
wonderful but they come in plastic trays

531
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:44,199
every single one and 3,000 take up a

532
00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:47,720
whole pallet instead of taking up uh a

533
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:50,200
little box versus like rocker Peak Cube

534
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:51,720
so basically having the team on board

535
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:54,519
with what your ethics are and what your

536
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:55,720
goals are really really helps everyone

537
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:57,519
helps you steer the ship away from

538
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:59,120
icebergs and and it's more important now

539
00:20:57,519 --> 00:21:01,679
than ever because it's tight out there

540
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:03,639
you know in the Cannabis

541
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:06,400
industry yeah and I have to give you a

542
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:09,480
compliment there um there's very few

543
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,440
people that I I've met in this journey

544
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:13,960
you know through this industry that can

545
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:16,720
that can transition from being a grower

546
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:18,519
to running a running a business

547
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,480
essentially a corporation at this at

548
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:23,240
this scale uh I personally found I don't

549
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:26,079
have that skill I'm not good at managing

550
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:27,640
Personnel um when I had a farm as it

551
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:30,000
grew larger things got a lot more

552
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:32,000
scattered because I didn't have the the

553
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,720
staff couldn't see that Vision because I

554
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,720
hadn't uh you know elucidated it very

555
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:39,360
well um they didn't have delineated

556
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:42,880
tasks there was just kind of a list of

557
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:44,158
tasks so having that that accountability

558
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,080
and that

559
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:49,880
transparency and that Vision all really

560
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:53,278
well L laned out is is I think one of

561
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:55,799
the key components to a successful

562
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:57,079
company um and I I think that it's

563
00:21:55,798 --> 00:21:59,319
amazing that you're able to do that a

564
00:21:57,079 --> 00:22:01,439
lot of times I found with small

565
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:02,879
businesses you have to bring in someone

566
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,798
for that next stage of growth it's

567
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,400
rarely the founder that's able to

568
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:08,359
continue on because they don't have

569
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,000
those same skills like you could be an

570
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:12,479
incredible grower but you may not be

571
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,759
good at managing you know 100 people uh

572
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:18,519
they're very different skill sets so um

573
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:19,798
kudos to you in that regard um did you

574
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:21,759
want to add to that because I I was

575
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:25,359
going to trange change topics here and

576
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:27,038
start talking about uh climate and the

577
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:28,639
weather in Montana but did you want to

578
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:31,960
add anything else around personnel

579
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:34,720
before we move on um as far as building

580
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:36,960
a team um no I

581
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,360
mean that's that's the core thing is

582
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,319
just keep an open mind have good

583
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:42,639
expectations and yeah those were um that

584
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:45,038
transition that you just mentioned were

585
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,559
expensive lessons I'll say that it I had

586
00:22:45,038 --> 00:22:50,038
to uh learn the hard way and thank God

587
00:22:47,558 --> 00:22:52,319
that the getting was good as we our

588
00:22:50,038 --> 00:22:54,400
timing was just at a certain point lucky

589
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:57,720
because I could do the exact same thing

590
00:22:54,400 --> 00:23:01,159
I I used to work a lot physically now I

591
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:03,120
work just a lot and not physically and I

592
00:23:01,159 --> 00:23:04,520
could have the same exact mentality now

593
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:06,558
and try and be doing the same thing that

594
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:08,679
I was doing 10 years ago and I wouldn't

595
00:23:06,558 --> 00:23:10,038
stand a chance today you couldn't evolve

596
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:12,120
fast enough and you couldn't overcome

597
00:23:10,038 --> 00:23:13,879
those mistakes so like there's some luck

598
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:15,719
involved there too um you got to really

599
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:17,919
really care and at a certain point now

600
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:20,759
I'm dug in this is my life I'm in so I'm

601
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:22,240
not like if I have to evolve to save

602
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:24,879
everything to the company like that's

603
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:27,400
what you do um but but there's some luck

604
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,960
there and you just recognize that timing

605
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:31,600
was crucial for us

606
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,200
but no that's it that's all and and I

607
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:34,879
just to add one last point there is I

608
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,558
think treating your staff really really

609
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,320
well if you get the right person um

610
00:23:37,558 --> 00:23:41,319
taking care of them and making sure that

611
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:42,918
they're that you they they're sharing

612
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:45,960
your passion for the work that they're

613
00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:47,799
doing and that they are uh enjoying

614
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:50,278
their life that that they're creating at

615
00:23:47,798 --> 00:23:52,879
this facility I think is is a huge part

616
00:23:50,278 --> 00:23:55,000
of the success and just the overall

617
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,039
mentality and energy around the farm and

618
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,319
I saw that when I was there yeah yeah

619
00:23:57,038 --> 00:24:00,960
our culture is amazing and now really

620
00:23:59,319 --> 00:24:02,759
has been and a little bit that was luck

621
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,480
a little bit of that was passion and

622
00:24:02,759 --> 00:24:08,000
also because we live in Boseman Montana

623
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:09,640
so like I definitely want my people to

624
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,720
enjoy their life on their days off if

625
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:13,840
they're out there skiing uh or mountain

626
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:16,440
biking or camping or whitewater rafting

627
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:18,079
they're more likely to come into uh if

628
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,440
you're stoked on life you're more likely

629
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:20,839
or passionate about life or getting

630
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:24,278
after it you're a lot more likely to be

631
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:26,359
passionate about your job as well and so

632
00:24:24,278 --> 00:24:29,200
it's a little bit harder to uh maintain

633
00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:30,959
that for me now as like to some degree

634
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,759
the crews start keep staying the same

635
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:36,159
age and I'm I'm like uh now I've got a

636
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:37,839
family and uh you know I I have the the

637
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:40,360
core team that has come with me the

638
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:41,839
whole way but like you know there's a

639
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:43,558
little bit more turnover in trimmers and

640
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:46,038
butt tenders and whatever and

641
00:24:43,558 --> 00:24:47,398
you I I'm not like having beers with the

642
00:24:46,038 --> 00:24:49,599
crew or partying with the crew after

643
00:24:47,398 --> 00:24:52,199
work as much as because I have two kids

644
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:53,678
in a family and I try and like so it's a

645
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,759
little harder to maintain that culture

646
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:57,798
but luckily I think that my team my

647
00:24:55,759 --> 00:25:01,038
leadership team does a good job of

648
00:24:57,798 --> 00:25:04,119
carrying that torch and that culture has

649
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:06,038
has carried us a long ways um and and

650
00:25:04,119 --> 00:25:08,119
it's awesome that you can recognize that

651
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:10,200
because it's like it's essential and you

652
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:12,639
can't buy that you can't buy that magic

653
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:15,000
um something goes wrong at 4M on a

654
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,840
Friday you find a spot of mil do does

655
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,558
your IPM guy go home and tell you on

656
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:21,079
Monday or does he roll up his sleeves

657
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:22,839
stay late and and uh deal with that

658
00:25:21,079 --> 00:25:25,000
problem right now before it's a huge

659
00:25:22,839 --> 00:25:26,278
huge problem like you can't buy that

660
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,398
kind of accountability and that's where

661
00:25:26,278 --> 00:25:30,159
you lay out those core values uh are

662
00:25:28,398 --> 00:25:31,959
team has core values and one of them is

663
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:33,520
like accountability doing the right

664
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:35,079
thing with no one when no one is looking

665
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:37,798
and sustainability is a core value of

666
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:40,000
our company and when people know that

667
00:25:37,798 --> 00:25:43,720
you can you can I mean we hire and Fire

668
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,440
based off of our core values um and part

669
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:47,919
of that is Passion you know anyways

670
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,679
that's that's all awesome no that's

671
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:51,960
great advice I love that and I hope uh I

672
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:54,399
hope other people can have the same

673
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:57,079
success in that regard too because I do

674
00:25:54,398 --> 00:26:00,000
I I do I I can walk into a facility and

675
00:25:57,079 --> 00:26:02,759
usually tell pretty quickly just from a

676
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:06,119
few hos and and handshakes what the

677
00:26:02,759 --> 00:26:08,000
energy and the uh culture is at that

678
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:09,918
facility and and no one wants to work

679
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,919
somewhere where it's you know dark and

680
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:13,640
gloomy and the owner's always pissed off

681
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:16,240
and you know no one's happy with the

682
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:18,120
yields and so it all ties together and I

683
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,599
think creating a good environment goes a

684
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:22,119
long way to creating good plants so

685
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:24,480
that's that's a really good point about

686
00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:25,678
the human component um but let you you

687
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,558
talk you mentioned Boseman let's talk

688
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:30,600
about Boseman what's the weather like

689
00:26:27,558 --> 00:26:34,240
there year round um I think of Montana I

690
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:36,639
just think of harsh extreme climate what

691
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:39,440
uh what are you guys dealing with there

692
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:44,960
yeah it's interesting today's I think 97

693
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:46,840
degrees uh and what probably 10% R it'll

694
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:50,880
be or or even maybe a little drier than

695
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:52,759
that at the peak um we had a 100 mph

696
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,278
wind storm roll through Missoula last

697
00:26:52,759 --> 00:26:56,200
night luckily it didn't hit Boseman or

698
00:26:54,278 --> 00:26:58,480
my outdoor crop would have been

699
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:01,720
annihilated so uh we that actually just

700
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:04,558
missed us but that's touch and go um

701
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:07,079
last winter we had a week of uh it hit I

702
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:10,798
think 48 Below in Boseman 50 Below in

703
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:13,720
Montana so we have a 150 degree

704
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:17,038
differential um and that is a huge

705
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:18,720
challenge for us as far as um we have

706
00:27:17,038 --> 00:27:20,359
basically of the Four Seasons we have

707
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,519
three distinct ones as far as in the

708
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:24,359
green houses are concerned and that's uh

709
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:27,398
you know spring and fall are very

710
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:30,000
similar as far as the challenges we Face

711
00:27:27,398 --> 00:27:32,398
uh summer and winter and all of those

712
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,200
three distinct um phases have different

713
00:27:32,398 --> 00:27:38,158
settings and parameters for the brain on

714
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,880
our Wadsworth and that forces us you

715
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:43,200
know like Danny's been working on like a

716
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:44,799
master facilities calendar of when do we

717
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,240
close up our wet wall when do we start

718
00:27:44,798 --> 00:27:47,960
using in the middle of summer I'm not

719
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,200
using the roof vents because I don't

720
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:52,319
want bugs to come in but in the spring

721
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,880
and fall and winter that's hopefully the

722
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:57,398
bulk of what I'm using to vent the

723
00:27:53,880 --> 00:28:00,320
greenhouse so that 150° differential

724
00:27:57,398 --> 00:28:02,798
adds a ton of I would say excitement but

725
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:06,558
I don't it's not that fun for me

726
00:28:02,798 --> 00:28:09,398
anymore yeah what are some of the the

727
00:28:06,558 --> 00:28:12,000
key points that you like things that

728
00:28:09,398 --> 00:28:14,239
that you have to deal with when you have

729
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,278
say let's just start since it's summer

730
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,558
right now what what are the challenges

731
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:18,759
and how do you overcome them with this

732
00:28:17,558 --> 00:28:20,879
heat and low

733
00:28:18,759 --> 00:28:23,599
humidity you mentioned a wet wall for

734
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:26,559
example yeah one of my biggest fears is

735
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:28,119
just uh power outage on the hottest day

736
00:28:26,558 --> 00:28:30,278
of summer or the coldest night of winter

737
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:32,158
winter um those are those things are

738
00:28:30,278 --> 00:28:34,240
very scary to me because it doesn't take

739
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,720
long so one of the first or best

740
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,919
insurance policies we finally just

741
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:40,720
hooked up a a large uh natural gas power

742
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:42,399
generator backup generator now it

743
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,960
doesn't run the whole facility but it

744
00:28:42,398 --> 00:28:47,918
runs all the crucial

745
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:50,240
functions to limp us through uh 40 below

746
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:52,038
night at midnight for eight hours you

747
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,880
know I.E all the heaters and the mom

748
00:28:52,038 --> 00:28:57,278
room lights and you know a couple of you

749
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:59,320
know just the the skeleton Essentials of

750
00:28:57,278 --> 00:29:01,558
survival and it will also run the light

751
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:03,079
depth curtains so that I can close the

752
00:29:01,558 --> 00:29:04,720
curtains and run a couple of exhaust

753
00:29:03,079 --> 00:29:06,678
fans with a wet wall on the hottest day

754
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,440
of the year so the wet wall is

755
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:10,000
absolutely essential I mean our our

756
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:14,480
green houses are

757
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:17,278
basically 78 to 83 degrees year round

758
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,839
summer and winter and um you know

759
00:29:17,278 --> 00:29:21,240
there's a moving Target there where

760
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:22,720
you're you're actually in the summer all

761
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,480
summer you're doing a cooling mechanism

762
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:27,319
so you let it get up to 81 and then you

763
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:30,319
cool it down to 78 versus in the winter

764
00:29:27,319 --> 00:29:32,079
you let it heat up naturally to 83 and

765
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:35,158
then you just exhaust it so basically

766
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:36,879
you're you're heating up versus cooling

767
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:39,679
down and you're letting it rebound

768
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:41,240
naturally in the summer back up and in

769
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:42,759
the winter you're heating it up and

770
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:44,399
letting it cool naturally down and all

771
00:29:42,759 --> 00:29:45,919
you can never really hit not only do we

772
00:29:44,398 --> 00:29:49,000
have a ton of microclimates Within These

773
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:50,240
green houses um which is a challenge in

774
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,558
and of itself and something that's kind

775
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,919
of hard to understand or even like

776
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:56,960
really measure because usually our

777
00:29:54,919 --> 00:29:58,759
Wadsworth brain system just measures a

778
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:01,079
few key points in the green it doesn't

779
00:29:58,759 --> 00:30:03,558
have uh that's one of our future goals

780
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:05,240
is to have eight parameter points where

781
00:30:03,558 --> 00:30:07,398
you can actually measure that

782
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:09,880
differential in microclimates throughout

783
00:30:07,398 --> 00:30:11,678
the whole greenhouse and and we've made

784
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:14,360
some progress there in the past and then

785
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:17,320
like life gets busy so in the summer you

786
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:20,079
know that temperature is a huge uh issue

787
00:30:17,319 --> 00:30:22,480
right now Danny's actually hooking up um

788
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:24,240
misters as well because one of our our

789
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:27,079
big goals in all of our transitional

790
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:30,159
periods from the Clone room to the vedro

791
00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:32,119
um you want to Mass those parameters for

792
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:33,919
a couple of days as you transfer down so

793
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:36,599
if you've got 90% humidity in the Clone

794
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:38,840
room you want to have 85% humidity on

795
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:41,439
day one as you transplant those clones

796
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:43,959
and slowly phase it down a little bit

797
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,880
and then get it down to that you know

798
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:48,440
70% in the vegro well then you need to

799
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:50,360
have as you transplant into the greenh

800
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:51,960
houses you want to have a super high

801
00:30:50,359 --> 00:30:54,038
humidity in there to basically reduce

802
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:56,798
any opportunities for transplant shock

803
00:30:54,038 --> 00:30:58,839
so one thing in the summer that we found

804
00:30:56,798 --> 00:31:01,200
now for the most part it's amazing how

805
00:30:58,839 --> 00:31:03,398
living soil is so

806
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,440
um has it provides such a wonderful

807
00:31:03,398 --> 00:31:06,959
buffer um you'd be amazed at how many

808
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,558
times my hoop houses that don't have

809
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:12,480
very much control at all uh it almost

810
00:31:09,558 --> 00:31:15,638
seems like VPD isn't that important when

811
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:18,319
you have a big deep living soil bed

812
00:31:15,638 --> 00:31:19,879
because those plants can just absorb 5%

813
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:22,798
humidity and they'll be praying I've

814
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:24,120
I've regularly outperformed my really

815
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:26,519
really nice green houses with all the

816
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:28,239
bells and whistles with a simple hoop

817
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:29,919
house and just natural summer and it

818
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,079
doesn't make any sense cuz your VPD is

819
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:35,559
way off but but that living soil buffers

820
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:38,158
that to an incredible degree um

821
00:31:35,558 --> 00:31:39,638
but if you're talking about you know

822
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:41,720
really getting down to the economics of

823
00:31:39,638 --> 00:31:45,240
it and if you're trying to shave days

824
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:46,240
off your cycle um for example we in the

825
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,880
Clone room they're going to spend you

826
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,240
know 11 to 14 days in the bedroom

827
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:51,799
they're going to spend 14 to 18 days and

828
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:54,038
then we're going to transplant them from

829
00:31:51,798 --> 00:31:56,480
the bedroom into our flowering green

830
00:31:54,038 --> 00:32:00,200
houses they're going to have like um 10

831
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:02,880
to 14 days in in a vegetative growth in

832
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:05,720
that Greenhouse well if I want it 10 and

833
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:08,840
not 14 I need to have the least amount

834
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:10,200
of um stress involved in that transition

835
00:32:08,839 --> 00:32:14,038
so that they can hit the ground running

836
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:16,000
so little things like having misters to

837
00:32:14,038 --> 00:32:17,679
you know match the proper VPD that they

838
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,038
were at is going to really shave that

839
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:22,038
off and and for a while there this is

840
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:23,798
actually something that David Peron uh

841
00:32:22,038 --> 00:32:25,558
when we finally brought in a consultant

842
00:32:23,798 --> 00:32:28,240
uh kind of helped me think before I was

843
00:32:25,558 --> 00:32:30,000
always thinking um

844
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:33,120
can I afford this should I spend

845
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,240
$112,000 on uh these systems and he kind

846
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:36,079
of helped me think because a lot of

847
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,558
times I don't have anyone to B bounce

848
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:39,798
the financial aspects off of that's kind

849
00:32:38,558 --> 00:32:41,119
of what the buck ends here as far as

850
00:32:39,798 --> 00:32:43,079
being an owner before you're talking

851
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:44,398
about quality consistency labor

852
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:47,398
reduction with your crew but you're not

853
00:32:44,398 --> 00:32:49,278
talking about like yeah the the cost

854
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:52,119
benefit analysis of it and David helped

855
00:32:49,278 --> 00:32:54,398
me like all right I'm thinking can I

856
00:32:52,119 --> 00:32:56,879
afford $10,000 right now for a Mis

857
00:32:54,398 --> 00:32:58,678
system well if you shave five days off

858
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,639
of your veg cycle in your flowering

859
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:03,600
greenhouse and you've got four green

860
00:33:00,638 --> 00:33:05,558
houses and you've got so basically four

861
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:08,319
and a half Cycles a year you're looking

862
00:33:05,558 --> 00:33:10,638
at shaving um you know 20 days you're

863
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:12,240
getting 20 extra days of of utilization

864
00:33:10,638 --> 00:33:15,678
and flowering in a greenhouse times four

865
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:18,440
greenh houses that $10,000 could equal

866
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:20,200
80 $90,000 a year you can't afford not

867
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:22,360
to do that and and just like flipping

868
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:24,558
that mentality on its head of

869
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:25,918
like oh boy I don't want to spend 10

870
00:33:24,558 --> 00:33:29,759
grand right now but I don't want to lose

871
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:31,639
out on um 20 days of of productive

872
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:33,558
growth over the course of the year so

873
00:33:31,638 --> 00:33:35,359
like like just changing your mindset of

874
00:33:33,558 --> 00:33:38,480
how to think about these things has been

875
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:41,038
really um extremely helpful to

876
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:43,759
me yeah the biggest place I see that is

877
00:33:41,038 --> 00:33:45,759
with uh upgrading lights from HPS to

878
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:50,119
LEDs people are like oh man I can get

879
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:52,679
these HPS so cheaply um and when you

880
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:54,158
switch over to LEDs a lot of times when

881
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:57,000
we do the math with some of these

882
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:58,320
Growers it's like your your savings on

883
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,720
the electrical bill

884
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:02,079
within two three Cycles will have

885
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,000
covered the cost of the lights and now

886
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:07,638
you're just saving you're just saving

887
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,159
money um but it's that mentality switch

888
00:34:07,638 --> 00:34:11,759
like you said of you know what you're

889
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:13,760
currently doing what's looking ahead at

890
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,599
the future and looking at your cost you

891
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,280
know cost benefit analysis I think is

892
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:20,320
really important yeah that's that's a

893
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:22,760
great Point um going way back you

894
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:24,320
mentioned wet walls can you describe a

895
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:26,560
wet wall though for people who may not

896
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,960
be familiar with the term I wasn't

897
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:30,838
familiar with it uh you know coming from

898
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:33,639
the Seattle area it's nothing that I had

899
00:34:30,838 --> 00:34:35,679
ever had to incorporate into my

900
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:37,440
Greenhouse yeah it's essentially a

901
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:42,000
radiator for a car what it does is it

902
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:45,119
it's a cardboard wall that uh runs water

903
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,519
uh through this cardboard wall and it

904
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:49,879
draws air across it so all of our green

905
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:51,838
houses are staged to have you know your

906
00:34:49,878 --> 00:34:53,398
first exhaust fan going to go on at this

907
00:34:51,838 --> 00:34:54,878
temperature and then one degree higher

908
00:34:53,398 --> 00:34:58,799
your second exhaust fan is going to go

909
00:34:54,878 --> 00:35:00,118
on then your third uh step is that water

910
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,119
is going to start your pad pump will

911
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:03,358
turn on which will run water through so

912
00:35:02,119 --> 00:35:05,599
basically this is just a cooling

913
00:35:03,358 --> 00:35:08,159
mechanism it's um a lot of people refer

914
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:11,200
to them of as a swamp cooler it's a you

915
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:13,838
know it's just a air conditioning uh

916
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:15,919
it's a swamp cooler is what it is so and

917
00:35:13,838 --> 00:35:19,078
they don't work everywhere now Seattle

918
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:22,400
Florida you know basically the Montana

919
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:24,560
is absolutely perfect for wet walls the

920
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,720
higher your temperature and the lower

921
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:28,920
your humidity the more cooling benefits

922
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:31,039
you're going to get so I can have 108°

923
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:33,200
here and I can have my Greenhouse I bet

924
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:34,960
I could get it down to like maybe even

925
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:38,480
into the 60s you know what I mean I can

926
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:40,280
have a 30 30 plus degree temperature

927
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:42,559
differential just because of that wet

928
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:44,160
wall um now I think combined with

929
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:45,559
misters I know a few other green houses

930
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:47,719
here in Montana that don't have wet

931
00:35:45,559 --> 00:35:50,599
walls but they have misters and they

932
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:51,919
also use shade curtains um which there's

933
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:53,800
don't give me I don't think that's the

934
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:56,639
best method but the mis's also uh

935
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:57,880
combined to help with that Cooling and

936
00:35:56,639 --> 00:36:00,838
of course increasing the humidity and

937
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:03,680
getting your VPD in check but um the

938
00:36:00,838 --> 00:36:06,400
hotter it is and the drier it is the

939
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:08,358
more effective your uh wet wall is going

940
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:12,480
to be but Montana is literally the dream

941
00:36:08,358 --> 00:36:14,480
climate for wet wall efficacy so that

942
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,519
that's what a wet wall is and and it's

943
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,719
crucial otherwise our green houses I I

944
00:36:16,519 --> 00:36:20,559
guess I shouldn't say crucial because I

945
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:23,159
do have hoop houses without wet walls

946
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:25,078
that are probably 100 degrees right now

947
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:26,358
and man they're happy too um but that's

948
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:28,280
because of living soil if I was in a

949
00:36:26,358 --> 00:36:29,838
hydro system they would not be happy

950
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:32,480
with having hot Roots like that you know

951
00:36:29,838 --> 00:36:34,318
what I mean um and we have found that

952
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,199
not having or having raised beds that

953
00:36:34,318 --> 00:36:39,519
tap into the ground in in a hoop house

954
00:36:36,199 --> 00:36:41,000
will really even um improve that the

955
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:42,440
more they can like the more those roots

956
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,920
can be cool the more they can handle

957
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:47,358
those um high temperature and low

958
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:49,760
humidities but the wet wall is is not

959
00:36:47,358 --> 00:36:51,920
only crucial to our operation but it

960
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:54,520
also in increases your humidity a little

961
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:57,159
bit so that brings you closer to VPD

962
00:36:54,519 --> 00:36:58,400
with that being said there's you know

963
00:36:57,159 --> 00:37:00,159
too much out of the Year where I don't

964
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,079
stand a chance of keeping VPD and that

965
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:04,078
is like you know that July August time

966
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:05,880
where I can't get it humid enough

967
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:08,280
although if you check back when those

968
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:09,119
misters are in I might finally be there

969
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:13,400
we'll

970
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:15,559
see cool cool that's awesome um one

971
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:17,720
thing that I thought of as you were

972
00:37:15,559 --> 00:37:22,920
explaining that and talking about uh the

973
00:37:17,719 --> 00:37:26,519
wet wall was the um the the the tubing

974
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:29,599
that you use to to move large volumes of

975
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:31,599
Air ac across the entire beds I came

976
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:33,079
back to myig grow and people have asked

977
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:36,079
me like hey what are those tubes that

978
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:38,599
you have in the bottom of your beds and

979
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:41,680
I'm using Greenhouse convection tubing

980
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:43,280
um you actually are using a commercial

981
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:47,000
product I couldn't get that commercial

982
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:49,319
product um on the scale of you know an

983
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,920
R&amp;D room uh they just don't sell you

984
00:37:49,318 --> 00:37:53,679
know 10 foot sections of it uh at an

985
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,240
affordable price so I'm using Greenhouse

986
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:57,039
convection tubing for anyone listening

987
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:59,000
but can you talk a little bit about that

988
00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:01,039
the uh I think they duck socks was the

989
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,599
name of the company that you went with

990
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:05,838
yeah I believe that's correct um that

991
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:09,440
was another this is kind of the

992
00:38:05,838 --> 00:38:11,799
beautiful uh you know props to Danny for

993
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:13,760
coming up with that because that was

994
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:15,960
another scenario where I was using floor

995
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:18,359
fans to increase air flow uh sometimes

996
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:20,920
during the winter with microclimates we

997
00:38:18,358 --> 00:38:23,559
were having mildew issues and so I was

998
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:25,559
just adding more floor fans and more

999
00:38:23,559 --> 00:38:27,279
dehumidifiers the first year and when

1000
00:38:25,559 --> 00:38:29,679
times were good I was just adding um

1001
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:31,000
yeah basically oh let's put up another

1002
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:32,279
dehumidifier well at a certain point you

1003
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,639
got to stop throwing money at it and you

1004
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:36,200
got to start like really addressing the

1005
00:38:33,639 --> 00:38:38,199
root of the problem um which is doesn't

1006
00:38:36,199 --> 00:38:40,439
matter how many dehes I put in here I

1007
00:38:38,199 --> 00:38:42,639
don't seem to be fixing this issue and

1008
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:46,599
the issue was airf flow

1009
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:49,679
and so at that time we had a higher

1010
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:53,760
plant count per canopy we were doing um

1011
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:55,118
I think 12 or nine plants per 4x4 bed

1012
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,560
and we basically had a middle row of

1013
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:59,720
plants so we had three on the either

1014
00:38:57,559 --> 00:39:02,358
side and then three down the middle well

1015
00:38:59,719 --> 00:39:04,879
we reduced our plant count we found that

1016
00:39:02,358 --> 00:39:07,679
we didn't actually lose any um time on

1017
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:09,160
our veg cycle and that also opened up a

1018
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:11,078
little aisle down the middle the idea

1019
00:39:09,159 --> 00:39:14,159
was that we needed a little bit more we

1020
00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:16,079
and we also increased our um

1021
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:18,199
pre-transplant pruning or our

1022
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:22,200
post-transplant pruning and our 21-day

1023
00:39:18,199 --> 00:39:24,598
leafing and and pruning events to reduce

1024
00:39:22,199 --> 00:39:26,799
transpiration uh increase under canopy

1025
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:28,519
air flow and it still wasn't quite

1026
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:31,000
enough it did help solve the problem but

1027
00:39:28,519 --> 00:39:34,400
we were still having like I think dead

1028
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:36,079
spots Under The Canopy and so you know I

1029
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,039
once again you POS the problem to the

1030
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:40,440
team and Danny's like well what about

1031
00:39:38,039 --> 00:39:41,719
these I was like uh we were originally

1032
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:43,720
thinking about putting those kind of in

1033
00:39:41,719 --> 00:39:44,879
the upper parts of the the greenhouse

1034
00:39:43,719 --> 00:39:46,559
but then they block light and there's

1035
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:49,480
all these issues with that

1036
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:51,559
and with our new lowered plant CR and

1037
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:53,318
our increased pruning there's a

1038
00:39:51,559 --> 00:39:55,159
beautiful aisle right there under the

1039
00:39:53,318 --> 00:39:57,639
green houses it was like all you know so

1040
00:39:55,159 --> 00:40:00,559
Danny kind of came up with that uh cep

1041
00:39:57,639 --> 00:40:02,239
and design and another potential

1042
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:03,960
subsidiary benefit of that is because

1043
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:06,879
those uh and if you want we could post a

1044
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:10,240
picture and the um and exactly what

1045
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:11,519
company those are uh on this website if

1046
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:13,439
you remind me I'll have Danny get you

1047
00:40:11,519 --> 00:40:16,039
all that information so people know but

1048
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:18,599
it's also sucking up air right off the

1049
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:20,480
ground so if the CO2 is sinking in there

1050
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:23,119
you're actually kind of running like CO2

1051
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:26,159
Rich uh fresh air through those duck

1052
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:27,920
socks and you're getting nice even um

1053
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:31,960
air flow all the way through the lower

1054
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:33,800
canopy and I would say that took us

1055
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:35,559
another a good chunk of the way to

1056
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:37,240
solving our problem and it was actually

1057
00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:38,599
a pretty cheap and Innovative solution

1058
00:40:37,239 --> 00:40:40,199
that that was a that was a really nice

1059
00:40:38,599 --> 00:40:44,680
one it worked really

1060
00:40:40,199 --> 00:40:46,838
well yeah I know um going back in time

1061
00:40:44,679 --> 00:40:48,639
here from talking to Clack ofis cute if

1062
00:40:46,838 --> 00:40:50,719
when he was talking about his favorite

1063
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:53,239
facility design it would be air moving

1064
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:57,439
upwards from the ground up and then from

1065
00:40:53,239 --> 00:41:00,239
talking to Dr Nadia SAA uh Dr Green

1066
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:03,119
house really the airflow expert in the

1067
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:06,519
industry she had also talked about how

1068
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:08,200
using uh airf flow like this so these so

1069
00:41:06,519 --> 00:41:12,599
picture for people who are listening

1070
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:14,759
picture like a 8 or 12 in uh ducting

1071
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:17,318
like you would use you know to to duct

1072
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:20,280
your your house or your your grow and

1073
00:41:17,318 --> 00:41:23,119
then make it out of fabric or in my case

1074
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:26,599
make it out of plastic with two 45°

1075
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:27,760
holes angled up and then a a big 8 in or

1076
00:41:26,599 --> 00:41:30,359
12-in fan

1077
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:33,599
moving the air through that giant tube

1078
00:41:30,358 --> 00:41:37,960
so it's it's diffusing a large amount of

1079
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:43,039
air across across a large area Under The

1080
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:47,960
Canopy uh at a very high volume but low

1081
00:41:43,039 --> 00:41:50,199
uh velocity um and so you don't get um

1082
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:51,838
calcium issues in terms of like too much

1083
00:41:50,199 --> 00:41:54,279
evapo transpiration but you like you

1084
00:41:51,838 --> 00:41:56,078
said you're getting the CO2 pushed back

1085
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:59,200
up into the stomata which is where you

1086
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:00,960
want it um and it gives you it removes a

1087
00:41:59,199 --> 00:42:05,000
lot of those micro Pockets it has a lot

1088
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:06,280
of potential benefits so I hope that

1089
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,159
describes it and we can we can post

1090
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:11,119
photos for sure yep that yeah that that

1091
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:12,559
microclimate it definitely helped uh

1092
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:13,920
eliminate microclimates within the

1093
00:42:12,559 --> 00:42:16,400
greenhouse because anytime you have a

1094
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:18,079
big room it's not all consistent all the

1095
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:20,119
way across it's colder near the wet wall

1096
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:22,640
or the intakes and it's hotter on the

1097
00:42:20,119 --> 00:42:24,920
other side and you uh you know you're

1098
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:26,519
going to have a harder time getting your

1099
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:28,000
dehumidified air which you know

1100
00:42:26,519 --> 00:42:29,318
obviously isn't a this time of year but

1101
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,318
in the winter you've got different

1102
00:42:29,318 --> 00:42:33,880
cycles and different needs uh summer to

1103
00:42:31,318 --> 00:42:35,838
Winter getting that dehumidified air

1104
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:38,119
evenly spread out across the greenhouse

1105
00:42:35,838 --> 00:42:40,920
is a whole uh I mean that's a whole

1106
00:42:38,119 --> 00:42:43,559
Topic in and of itself and then like you

1107
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:45,480
said uh it does it makes those Leaf St

1108
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:48,519
just perfectly not so that you're over

1109
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:50,838
transpiring or or getting dry spots but

1110
00:42:48,519 --> 00:42:52,599
also so that every plant is getting that

1111
00:42:50,838 --> 00:42:54,558
fresh air and hopefully CO2 enriched

1112
00:42:52,599 --> 00:42:57,480
fresh air because those beds produce so

1113
00:42:54,559 --> 00:43:00,000
much CO2 um and the the where they draw

1114
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:02,519
it uh that's another thing too is before

1115
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:06,358
we actually put more dehes in and before

1116
00:43:02,519 --> 00:43:09,199
we put those duck socks in we switched

1117
00:43:06,358 --> 00:43:10,960
from vaf fans to HF fans in a circular

1118
00:43:09,199 --> 00:43:12,639
manner that was like the actually

1119
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:14,838
backing up even before any of that the

1120
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:18,719
first thing we did was reconfigure our

1121
00:43:14,838 --> 00:43:21,279
airf flow uh with oad fans so vertical

1122
00:43:18,719 --> 00:43:23,318
vaf is vertical air flow and HF is

1123
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:24,680
horizontal airf flow can you just touch

1124
00:43:23,318 --> 00:43:27,000
on that for people who may not be

1125
00:43:24,679 --> 00:43:29,159
familiar with these Greenhouse terms

1126
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,239
yeah yeah so the those vaf fans they

1127
00:43:29,159 --> 00:43:33,239
they basically suck up in a mushroom

1128
00:43:31,239 --> 00:43:34,279
cloud if you were to use a fog machine

1129
00:43:33,239 --> 00:43:36,118
which I've always daydreamed about

1130
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:37,680
renting a party fogger and just watching

1131
00:43:36,119 --> 00:43:40,838
the air flow in my green houses and we

1132
00:43:37,679 --> 00:43:43,239
never really we use our our dram fogger

1133
00:43:40,838 --> 00:43:46,558
but it doesn't quite produce a drastic

1134
00:43:43,239 --> 00:43:49,479
enough um you know it's it's not drastic

1135
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:51,000
enough that we can like really uh watch

1136
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:52,880
but I've always rent thought about just

1137
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,920
getting a good party fogger and really

1138
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:57,480
nailing down where there's dead spots in

1139
00:43:54,920 --> 00:44:00,200
your Greenhouse you know what I mean but

1140
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:02,639
sucks up and through and creates this

1141
00:44:00,199 --> 00:44:05,639
mushroom and the idea is as the air

1142
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:07,400
comes from the in our case I guess the

1143
00:44:05,639 --> 00:44:09,519
West the East Side the air is coming in

1144
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:11,838
from the intakes and it's getting

1145
00:44:09,519 --> 00:44:14,679
circulated in this mushroom pattern

1146
00:44:11,838 --> 00:44:16,960
slowly across the greenhouse uh touching

1147
00:44:14,679 --> 00:44:18,480
every single leaf surface but not so

1148
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:21,280
much that any single plant is getting

1149
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:23,760
blasted uh HF is just like you know like

1150
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:26,480
a standard uh box fan and we don't have

1151
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:29,359
standard box fans of course but um

1152
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:32,199
they're they're big circular airflow

1153
00:44:29,358 --> 00:44:33,639
fans and they're all positioned uh kind

1154
00:44:32,199 --> 00:44:36,239
of in a circular pattern around the

1155
00:44:33,639 --> 00:44:37,879
greenhouse so you've got three just

1156
00:44:36,239 --> 00:44:40,199
slightly offset on the north side of the

1157
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:41,960
greenhouse that blow to the west and

1158
00:44:40,199 --> 00:44:43,719
then there's three on the east side that

1159
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:46,318
blow to the East and it creates this big

1160
00:44:43,719 --> 00:44:48,639
circular pattern above the canopy once

1161
00:44:46,318 --> 00:44:52,519
again not lasting anything like a

1162
00:44:48,639 --> 00:44:55,279
racetrack exactly um now in a perfect

1163
00:44:52,519 --> 00:44:57,639
world I have recently seen a a seed

1164
00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:00,400
potato Farmers Nexus Greenhouse where he

1165
00:44:57,639 --> 00:45:04,519
actually put his wet wall below the

1166
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:07,039
greenhouse his entire Greenhouse was um

1167
00:45:04,519 --> 00:45:09,039
metal grading uh his floor his entire

1168
00:45:07,039 --> 00:45:11,358
floor was metal grading so he's got a

1169
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:14,079
wet wall and then you have roof Vents

1170
00:45:11,358 --> 00:45:15,880
and and vaf fans vertical air flow so

1171
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:19,079
basically your wet wall is going in

1172
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:21,599
under the floor it's percolating up

1173
00:45:19,079 --> 00:45:24,119
through the entire canopy slowly because

1174
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:25,680
heat rises as a air flow is Heating and

1175
00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:27,400
then it's just going out the roof vent

1176
00:45:25,679 --> 00:45:30,960
and it was like oh my God if I could

1177
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:33,960
redesign I might consider that you know

1178
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:35,920
um it's it's a pretty neat uh concept

1179
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:37,159
you know I don't know as to its efficacy

1180
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:41,119
I don't have any experience with it but

1181
00:45:37,159 --> 00:45:44,199
it was a cool design liked it a lot

1182
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:45,680
um we basically in the winter we

1183
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:47,279
typically are doing a little bit more so

1184
00:45:45,679 --> 00:45:48,558
we have two green houses that are vaf

1185
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:51,839
fans and we have two green houses that

1186
00:45:48,559 --> 00:45:52,960
are HF and you know there's kind of two

1187
00:45:51,838 --> 00:45:54,920
schools of thought there either you're

1188
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:58,079
mixing and stirring it in that racetrack

1189
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:59,599
pattern or you're just letting the warm

1190
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:01,480
air percolate up nicely through the

1191
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:03,280
leaves and then out the roof fence and

1192
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:04,519
you know jur is still out they both work

1193
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:06,920
neither is

1194
00:46:04,519 --> 00:46:08,400
wrong um but I haven't found strong

1195
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:11,358
enough evidence to like convert the

1196
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:13,000
other ones over from my original design

1197
00:46:11,358 --> 00:46:15,719
also it's a slightly smaller Greenhouse

1198
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:18,280
that's another uh problem that popped up

1199
00:46:15,719 --> 00:46:21,480
is I built the two new green houses to

1200
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:22,920
be 4200 square fet and that actually

1201
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:25,318
that bigger Greenhouse that wider

1202
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:27,599
designed made it harder for me to get

1203
00:46:25,318 --> 00:46:28,838
that dehumidified air over to the other

1204
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:30,400
side of the greenhouse but if I put the

1205
00:46:28,838 --> 00:46:32,039
dehumidifiers on that side then that

1206
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:34,200
blocks out that Southern Exposure sun

1207
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:36,880
and in the middle of winter you need

1208
00:46:34,199 --> 00:46:39,118
every bit of sun you can possibly get um

1209
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:40,960
so there's all these little uh every

1210
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:42,440
time you increase your scale or increase

1211
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:43,639
the size of facility you come up with

1212
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:47,240
completely new problems that you

1213
00:46:43,639 --> 00:46:48,759
couldn't possibly have foreseen um yep

1214
00:46:47,239 --> 00:46:50,919
hence why it's better to build out

1215
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:52,720
slowly

1216
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:55,280
exactly

1217
00:46:52,719 --> 00:46:58,959
um yeah so one of the things you

1218
00:46:55,280 --> 00:47:00,160
mentioned was Co 2 let's talk about that

1219
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:02,720
because you mentioned their beds are

1220
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:04,519
creating an incredible amount of CO2 how

1221
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:06,919
do you manage

1222
00:47:04,519 --> 00:47:09,358
CO2 in your green

1223
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:12,079
houses yeah

1224
00:47:09,358 --> 00:47:14,759
so first this is a kind of an

1225
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:17,160
interesting thing so living soil facil

1226
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:20,920
we do have a CO2 burner in every single

1227
00:47:17,159 --> 00:47:24,480
one of our green houses they maybe get

1228
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:27,079
used two months a year um for the most

1229
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:28,920
part we rely on the CO2 that the

1230
00:47:27,079 --> 00:47:30,920
microbial action in the soil is

1231
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:33,559
producing so when we have an empty

1232
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:36,358
Greenhouse when I harvest I will get

1233
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:38,720
over a thousand parts per million um

1234
00:47:36,358 --> 00:47:41,920
built up in there and we get super high

1235
00:47:38,719 --> 00:47:44,279
nighttime co2's CO2 concentrations

1236
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:48,159
because that soil is producing so much

1237
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:49,880
CO2 on its own um now during the day two

1238
00:47:48,159 --> 00:47:51,879
things in the summertime there's no

1239
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:54,160
point in running uh we have an influence

1240
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:57,039
set with our wwor system our our control

1241
00:47:54,159 --> 00:47:59,358
system our Greenhouse controller so that

1242
00:47:57,039 --> 00:48:01,119
when an exhaust fan turns on the CO2

1243
00:47:59,358 --> 00:48:02,759
burner turns off because there's no

1244
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:04,960
reason at a certain point you're it's a

1245
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:06,720
drop in the ocean if you have the amount

1246
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:09,039
of uh exchange rate that our greenh

1247
00:48:06,719 --> 00:48:11,039
houses have on a hot summer day um as

1248
00:48:09,039 --> 00:48:12,800
far as like uh freshening the air it's

1249
00:48:11,039 --> 00:48:14,480
probably got new air in it every minute

1250
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:17,880
so you're not um there's really no

1251
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:19,358
reason to run CO2 there um and at that

1252
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:20,960
point even whether the soil is keeping

1253
00:48:19,358 --> 00:48:24,039
up so basically in the summer we're not

1254
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:25,920
running any CO2 at all um in the winter

1255
00:48:24,039 --> 00:48:27,639
we were running CO2 for a long time

1256
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:30,159
using those CO2 burners but what we

1257
00:48:27,639 --> 00:48:31,838
actually found was during the coldest

1258
00:48:30,159 --> 00:48:34,199
month of the year in Montana when we

1259
00:48:31,838 --> 00:48:35,279
actually have the least um par levels

1260
00:48:34,199 --> 00:48:37,879
from the

1261
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:40,079
sun we might be just a little underlit

1262
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:42,800
with our LED lights um in the winter see

1263
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:44,519
I'm trying to Stage it to the lowest

1264
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,920
common denominator now I have too much

1265
00:48:44,519 --> 00:48:47,679
light in the summer and I don't have

1266
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:49,559
quite enough light as if as compared to

1267
00:48:47,679 --> 00:48:51,798
If I Were a full indoor grow room in the

1268
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:54,839
wintertime but I usually am able to

1269
00:48:51,798 --> 00:48:56,199
utilize the sunshine 90% of the summer

1270
00:48:54,838 --> 00:49:00,039
my lights are completely off and I'm

1271
00:48:56,199 --> 00:49:02,480
only using the Sun and 40 or 50% of the

1272
00:49:00,039 --> 00:49:06,079
winner that's the same as

1273
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:09,880
well what basically ends up happening

1274
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:12,119
there is if I run CO2 too much in the

1275
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:13,760
winter time when I actually have it's

1276
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:17,079
that limiting factor you know what's

1277
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:18,480
that um what it maso's law the the the

1278
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:19,839
bucket concept have you ever seen the

1279
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:22,159
barrel analogy of there's always going

1280
00:49:19,838 --> 00:49:24,159
to be some limiting factor there and

1281
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:26,879
yeah your plants can only perform to

1282
00:49:24,159 --> 00:49:28,798
their highest uh potential based on

1283
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:30,798
whatever the limiting factor is and so a

1284
00:49:28,798 --> 00:49:36,039
lot of times in the winter when I feel

1285
00:49:30,798 --> 00:49:37,920
like I need the um CO2 I actually am a

1286
00:49:36,039 --> 00:49:40,199
little bit underlit especially for that

1287
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:45,519
January February run and that's kind of

1288
00:49:40,199 --> 00:49:47,239
like um using nitrous when your car is a

1289
00:49:45,519 --> 00:49:48,599
old jalape you know what I mean you're

1290
00:49:47,239 --> 00:49:50,078
you're not ready to really hit the gas

1291
00:49:48,599 --> 00:49:51,480
and you actually end up getting some we'

1292
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:53,240
we've actually Rec called you with some

1293
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:54,358
problems a few years ago where I

1294
00:49:53,239 --> 00:49:56,679
couldn't figure out I was having some

1295
00:49:54,358 --> 00:49:58,159
unusual uh Fox tailing and growth

1296
00:49:56,679 --> 00:49:59,519
patterns and I believe it was because I

1297
00:49:58,159 --> 00:50:03,199
was

1298
00:49:59,519 --> 00:50:05,199
essentially using CO2 when I was

1299
00:50:03,199 --> 00:50:06,719
underlit and therefore the plants

1300
00:50:05,199 --> 00:50:10,039
weren't really like Max know you don't

1301
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:12,598
need uh a th000 parts per million CO2 if

1302
00:50:10,039 --> 00:50:16,239
your par is too low uh it doesn't really

1303
00:50:12,599 --> 00:50:17,559
uh make sense there so we do use CO2 in

1304
00:50:16,239 --> 00:50:21,598
the winter but a lot of times it's

1305
00:50:17,559 --> 00:50:28,040
actually more that um November December

1306
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:29,640
when it's sunny and spring um before the

1307
00:50:28,039 --> 00:50:31,400
before it heats up for the day before

1308
00:50:29,639 --> 00:50:34,400
the exhaust bands are on those first

1309
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:36,400
couple hours of the morning in say March

1310
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:38,838
April that's when we're actually turning

1311
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:40,720
the CO2 burners on I haven't even seen

1312
00:50:38,838 --> 00:50:42,679
that much uh Effectiveness there I

1313
00:50:40,719 --> 00:50:43,798
believe basically I could run my CO2

1314
00:50:42,679 --> 00:50:45,879
burners and I could even get my

1315
00:50:43,798 --> 00:50:50,280
Greenhouse up to a thousand my my living

1316
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:52,599
soil beds outperform a CO2 burner on co2

1317
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:54,400
production um when there's a greenhouse

1318
00:50:52,599 --> 00:50:55,880
that's empty you can never quite tell

1319
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:58,680
CO2 production when the greenhouse is

1320
00:50:55,880 --> 00:51:00,559
full because those plant PL are actively

1321
00:50:58,679 --> 00:51:02,879
uh you know breathing it as you go so

1322
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:06,079
you can't really ever

1323
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:08,200
tell yeah so uh I had to double check it

1324
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:09,640
was it's Lee Big's law of the minimum

1325
00:51:08,199 --> 00:51:11,318
that's there we go that's the one you

1326
00:51:09,639 --> 00:51:14,798
were thinking of and and people if you

1327
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:17,519
can imagine a bucket with a bunch of

1328
00:51:14,798 --> 00:51:19,199
holes in it and basically you're you're

1329
00:51:17,519 --> 00:51:21,920
plugging the holes to figure out what

1330
00:51:19,199 --> 00:51:23,598
the limiting factor is and so if it's

1331
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:25,720
lighting don't worry about your

1332
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:27,519
fertility fix your lighting if it's your

1333
00:51:25,719 --> 00:51:29,199
VPD then you got to fix that before you

1334
00:51:27,519 --> 00:51:30,679
look at you know fertility or lighting

1335
00:51:29,199 --> 00:51:33,358
and so all of these things are related

1336
00:51:30,679 --> 00:51:35,239
and you're constantly as a grower trying

1337
00:51:33,358 --> 00:51:38,239
to figure out what your limiting factor

1338
00:51:35,239 --> 00:51:39,399
is it's a really good uh perspective

1339
00:51:38,239 --> 00:51:40,959
when you approach a grow and it's

1340
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:42,200
something I always do when I walk into a

1341
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:44,519
new grow is I think about what's the

1342
00:51:42,199 --> 00:51:47,118
limiting factor is it the watering the

1343
00:51:44,519 --> 00:51:49,400
fertility the lights the VPD the air

1344
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:52,440
flow all of these things so yeah that's

1345
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:56,798
a good point um getting back to the CO2

1346
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:59,639
though uh do you find that you need to

1347
00:51:56,798 --> 00:52:02,400
vent CO2 during nighttime hours in order

1348
00:51:59,639 --> 00:52:08,000
to not get excessively high

1349
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:10,400
CO2 no I we this this was an uh ongoing

1350
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:13,798
argument about four years ago whether it

1351
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:16,240
was worth um what well in the winter

1352
00:52:13,798 --> 00:52:17,880
time is when that happens um and in the

1353
00:52:16,239 --> 00:52:20,078
summer it doesn't seem to happen quite

1354
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:22,720
as much because I guess I just don't

1355
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:23,920
know why it just doesn't really um I

1356
00:52:22,719 --> 00:52:25,279
guess probably because also in the

1357
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:26,960
summertime we're still exhausting some

1358
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:28,160
air at night anyways but but typically

1359
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:30,599
in the winter

1360
00:52:28,159 --> 00:52:32,039
time I don't want to ever lose any of my

1361
00:52:30,599 --> 00:52:34,798
heat you know what I mean I don't want

1362
00:52:32,039 --> 00:52:38,239
to ever exhaust so I have uh limit set

1363
00:52:34,798 --> 00:52:39,838
with my Wadsworth system where you know

1364
00:52:38,239 --> 00:52:43,078
depending on the if you're in veg or

1365
00:52:39,838 --> 00:52:44,599
flower but so after 7 P.M I my exhaust

1366
00:52:43,079 --> 00:52:48,079
fans are all locked out for the night

1367
00:52:44,599 --> 00:52:50,920
they won't exhaust um for a while there

1368
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:52,400
um a former cultivator of mine Chad

1369
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:54,599
who's a really really knowledgeable guy

1370
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:56,039
we were having this ongoing discussion

1371
00:52:54,599 --> 00:52:59,640
or maybe argument about whether we

1372
00:52:56,039 --> 00:53:02,679
should be exhausting that CO2 at night

1373
00:52:59,639 --> 00:53:03,879
and for a while I did but what ends up

1374
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:05,639
happening is Technically when your

1375
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:08,358
heaters run they're producing some CO2

1376
00:53:05,639 --> 00:53:10,719
too you know I mean so like basically

1377
00:53:08,358 --> 00:53:12,159
I'd exhaust it out and because nothing's

1378
00:53:10,719 --> 00:53:14,159
transpiring but the green houses are

1379
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:15,920
still it just replaces it right away but

1380
00:53:14,159 --> 00:53:18,000
then I'm running my heaters and I'm just

1381
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:19,559
exhausting warm air which you know our

1382
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:23,000
utility bills are high enough in the

1383
00:53:19,559 --> 00:53:26,640
winter I never saw any evidence that a

1384
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:29,119
th000 PPM CO2 at night um had any

1385
00:53:26,639 --> 00:53:32,440
negative issues and then watching like

1386
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:34,559
um j plant speaker or argue with people

1387
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:36,400
on Instagram years ago where he was like

1388
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:38,200
turning them on an hour or two in the

1389
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:40,000
dark he's turning on a CO2 burner so

1390
00:53:38,199 --> 00:53:41,358
that that first hour or two of morning

1391
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,639
when those plants are starting to

1392
00:53:41,358 --> 00:53:46,920
transpire they have this high CO2 I've

1393
00:53:44,639 --> 00:53:50,759
never seen any evidence that like the

1394
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:53,599
kind of CO2 that living soil produces at

1395
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:56,000
night um has had any negative impacts to

1396
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:57,519
me but I haven't done a ton of extensive

1397
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,798
research on it because it's also pretty

1398
00:53:57,519 --> 00:54:01,960
costly and we have great at the end of

1399
00:53:59,798 --> 00:54:04,679
the day if I have a great harvest then I

1400
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:06,280
don't worry about like those it's it's

1401
00:54:04,679 --> 00:54:08,598
only when I start to have bad

1402
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:11,280
experiences that I start to like look

1403
00:54:08,599 --> 00:54:12,960
for the problem and if if it it's that's

1404
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:15,559
never been the common denominator is

1405
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:17,639
nighttime CO2 so I don't worry about it

1406
00:54:15,559 --> 00:54:19,000
and I don't exhaust it at night anymore

1407
00:54:17,639 --> 00:54:20,078
um I just assume that first thing in the

1408
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,679
morning those plants are going to have

1409
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:23,640
really good CO2 levels until the first

1410
00:54:21,679 --> 00:54:27,318
exhaust bands KCK

1411
00:54:23,639 --> 00:54:29,358
gone that's that's great I have seen

1412
00:54:27,318 --> 00:54:32,400
excessively high CO2 and I'm not talking

1413
00:54:29,358 --> 00:54:34,920
a th000 PPM I'm talking thousands of PPM

1414
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:40,160
2,000 3,000 PPM of

1415
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:41,480
CO2 um in some indoor facilities that uh

1416
00:54:40,159 --> 00:54:46,279
they were getting

1417
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:48,559
weird weird growth and um the one thing

1418
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:50,400
that did fix it was a nighttime venting

1419
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:54,160
again indoor facility different

1420
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:56,440
environment um alog together but um that

1421
00:54:54,159 --> 00:54:57,679
was and you know the size of the room

1422
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:59,798
relative to the amount of soil is

1423
00:54:57,679 --> 00:55:01,798
probably a big factor there too as well

1424
00:54:59,798 --> 00:55:04,639
as how much respiration you're getting

1425
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:06,000
yeah so volume of soil um so I just want

1426
00:55:04,639 --> 00:55:07,400
to bring it to people's attention as

1427
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,039
something maybe to look for but I think

1428
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:12,200
that's really great that you don't have

1429
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:15,000
to do that and in your case because you

1430
00:55:12,199 --> 00:55:17,519
are greenhouse in the winter and you are

1431
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:19,440
sacrificing all that heat you know you

1432
00:55:17,519 --> 00:55:20,639
you do have to make a a decision as to

1433
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:22,079
whether or not it's worth it in this

1434
00:55:20,639 --> 00:55:24,838
case it doesn't sound like it is so

1435
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:27,480
that's that's really good to hear

1436
00:55:24,838 --> 00:55:28,960
um yeah so I I just want to share a

1437
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:30,679
Counterpoint of a different experience

1438
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:31,960
but again this is why every every

1439
00:55:30,679 --> 00:55:33,960
facility is a little bit different and

1440
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:36,559
everyone has um everyone needs to look

1441
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:38,960
at their own facility specifically and

1442
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:40,480
figure out what what the requirements

1443
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:44,720
are there to be most successful because

1444
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:47,159
it is it is always a constant uh balance

1445
00:55:44,719 --> 00:55:50,480
there so on one hand you need to you

1446
00:55:47,159 --> 00:55:53,199
want to maintain at least ambient CO2

1447
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:56,480
what 420 PPM is sort of your our current

1448
00:55:53,199 --> 00:55:58,159
ambient air CO2 um so you need that air

1449
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:59,838
flow exchange otherwise if you're not

1450
00:55:58,159 --> 00:56:01,920
getting enough CO2 from your beds or

1451
00:55:59,838 --> 00:56:03,279
let's say you're not running living soil

1452
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:05,240
those plants are not going to have

1453
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:07,880
sufficient CO2 especially if you're

1454
00:56:05,239 --> 00:56:09,759
running your ppfd at you know a thousand

1455
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:12,400
or higher there's no point if there's no

1456
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:14,039
CO2 in the room so there you need that

1457
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:15,358
air exchange but if you're exchanging it

1458
00:56:14,039 --> 00:56:17,960
with really cold air and now you're out

1459
00:56:15,358 --> 00:56:19,719
of VPD range uh that's creating a

1460
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:20,838
different problem so as a grower you

1461
00:56:19,719 --> 00:56:22,358
kind of have to think through these

1462
00:56:20,838 --> 00:56:24,400
things and really decide what makes the

1463
00:56:22,358 --> 00:56:27,199
most sense in your environment and in

1464
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:29,000
your case it sounds like um

1465
00:56:27,199 --> 00:56:30,919
the environment is probably the biggest

1466
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,639
Factor limiting factor for you because

1467
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:36,400
you are forced to deal with these such

1468
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:38,558
extreme conditions like how do

1469
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:40,358
you I mean do you do you have a lung

1470
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:42,680
room or you just force you don't really

1471
00:56:40,358 --> 00:56:43,679
have the ability to uh you know

1472
00:56:42,679 --> 00:56:46,199
condition the

1473
00:56:43,679 --> 00:56:47,879
air in the winter I assume in the summer

1474
00:56:46,199 --> 00:56:50,038
you're conditioning the air a little bit

1475
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:53,318
possibly um through through the use of

1476
00:56:50,039 --> 00:56:56,039
your wet wall but what do you do in

1477
00:56:53,318 --> 00:56:57,880
terms of the air conditioning ideally in

1478
00:56:56,039 --> 00:56:59,960
the winter time I try and bring in as

1479
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:03,280
little cold air as possible you know

1480
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:04,480
like it's it's like this either for one

1481
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,359
thing it does create a little bit of a

1482
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:08,798
microclimate and some of the early

1483
00:57:06,358 --> 00:57:10,318
designs there so my wet wall is

1484
00:57:08,798 --> 00:57:12,719
completely sealed up so part of this

1485
00:57:10,318 --> 00:57:14,079
master facilities calendar is uh

1486
00:57:12,719 --> 00:57:16,279
sometime around November when the

1487
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:19,599
hottest you know when you no longer have

1488
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:21,839
temperatures above say 45 or 50 degrees

1489
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:23,920
will go and we will put uh black white

1490
00:57:21,838 --> 00:57:26,599
black or you know double wall plastic

1491
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:30,960
over all the wet walls um and we'll and

1492
00:57:26,599 --> 00:57:33,240
all the um black blackout uh breathable

1493
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:36,280
walls on the other side of the Breezeway

1494
00:57:33,239 --> 00:57:38,919
so we also do have a Breezeway on the

1495
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:40,920
exhaust side of every room that so that

1496
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:42,318
I'm not just sucking all that warm air

1497
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:45,880
out I'm actually putting it into the

1498
00:57:42,318 --> 00:57:47,440
Breezeway first um then you use your

1499
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:50,240
smallest denominator fan so in the

1500
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:53,159
winter time I might only use um roof

1501
00:57:50,239 --> 00:57:54,879
venting for my next gens and that's it

1502
00:57:53,159 --> 00:57:57,480
the only exhaust I don't bring any air

1503
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:58,760
in I mean except for what obviously when

1504
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:00,079
whenever you let air out some's going to

1505
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:01,319
get sucked in but it just gets sucked in

1506
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:03,000
through the cracks like you're just

1507
00:58:01,318 --> 00:58:05,279
exhausting hot air you're not actually

1508
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:08,119
bringing cold air in um some of the

1509
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:09,839
early designs of our so this is all a

1510
00:58:08,119 --> 00:58:12,798
staging question

1511
00:58:09,838 --> 00:58:14,239
so when it gets too warm and this is

1512
00:58:12,798 --> 00:58:15,798
there's three distinct Seasons like I

1513
00:58:14,239 --> 00:58:18,759
said summer fall count is one for the

1514
00:58:15,798 --> 00:58:20,280
greenhouse winter and summer the very

1515
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:22,280
first thing to come on is our condensate

1516
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:24,039
fan which is a very upper smallest fan

1517
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:27,640
in the greenhouse and that's like above

1518
00:58:24,039 --> 00:58:29,400
the blackout curtains so

1519
00:58:27,639 --> 00:58:32,400
we've implemented so many different

1520
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:34,200
trials to so first the condensate fan

1521
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:36,119
will come on and that's way up there and

1522
00:58:34,199 --> 00:58:37,879
it has an opportunity it's above the vaf

1523
00:58:36,119 --> 00:58:41,119
fans so it has the opportunity to come

1524
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:42,920
in and slowly stir a little at a time so

1525
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:44,200
that you're not getting like super cold

1526
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:46,240
on one side of the greenhouse and then

1527
00:58:44,199 --> 00:58:48,239
super hot on the other second if it's

1528
00:58:46,239 --> 00:58:50,078
too warm so you can you can have a zero

1529
00:58:48,239 --> 00:58:51,399
degree day and if it's sunny you're

1530
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:54,000
still exhausting air and you're bringing

1531
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:55,519
in cold air second the after that

1532
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,119
condensate fan has exhausted its

1533
00:58:55,519 --> 00:58:59,440
potential which very rarely happens in

1534
00:58:57,119 --> 00:59:01,400
the winter you'll go to the Gable

1535
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:03,720
exhaust fan that's stage two it gets to

1536
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:06,599
83 degrees in the winter time Gable

1537
00:59:03,719 --> 00:59:08,399
exhaust fan comes on um the big exhaust

1538
00:59:06,599 --> 00:59:11,000
fans are now disabled for the winner you

1539
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:13,920
never have to use those so when the

1540
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:15,440
Gable exhaust fan comes on uh we have a

1541
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:17,400
little uh ramp it looks like a

1542
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:21,079
drawbridge and that's so that the Gable

1543
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:22,798
exhaust fan kind of gets um jumped

1544
00:59:21,079 --> 00:59:25,039
essentially you picture this draw

1545
00:59:22,798 --> 00:59:27,480
drawbridge from a castle halfway up as

1546
00:59:25,039 --> 00:59:29,319
it comes in it gets kind of like guided

1547
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:31,119
up into the upper parts of the

1548
00:59:29,318 --> 00:59:33,358
greenhouse and then once again

1549
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:35,318
distributed via vaf fan so it doesn't

1550
00:59:33,358 --> 00:59:37,159
just sink right on and make those plants

1551
00:59:35,318 --> 00:59:39,318
closest to the Gable exhaust band uh

1552
00:59:37,159 --> 00:59:41,038
really cold um which also can lead to

1553
00:59:39,318 --> 00:59:42,960
like condensation and therefore Bud rot

1554
00:59:41,039 --> 00:59:45,319
you know when you have these really cold

1555
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:49,079
um and then a really hot heater kick on

1556
00:59:45,318 --> 00:59:51,440
there's also um settings so that my

1557
00:59:49,079 --> 00:59:54,280
exhaust fan can't be on at the same time

1558
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:56,480
as my heater is on and my team has to be

1559
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:58,480
trained to we should be to have a

1560
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:00,358
conversation in the greenhouse and

1561
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:01,760
within five minutes if a exhaust fan

1562
01:00:00,358 --> 01:00:03,960
kicks on and then five minutes later a

1563
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:06,400
heater kicks on someone on my team needs

1564
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:08,119
to have that sick sense of like oh that

1565
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:11,039
shouldn't be happening we should expand

1566
01:00:08,119 --> 01:00:14,280
our um differential you know we can make

1567
01:00:11,039 --> 01:00:17,200
our heaters kick on at 76 degrees or 77

1568
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:19,079
and we won't have an exhaust until 83 or

1569
01:00:17,199 --> 01:00:22,000
even 84 if it's the middle of winter

1570
01:00:19,079 --> 01:00:23,839
therefore you get this nice yo-yo effect

1571
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,559
where ideally depending on the

1572
01:00:23,838 --> 01:00:27,159
temperatures depending on the season the

1573
01:00:25,559 --> 01:00:29,640
heater will kick on and an exhaust band

1574
01:00:27,159 --> 01:00:31,038
will never kick on um that didn't fully

1575
01:00:29,639 --> 01:00:34,000
solve all of our problems we had

1576
01:00:31,039 --> 01:00:35,920
Wadsworth designed us a burp feature so

1577
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,798
on those coldest days of the year where

1578
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:39,440
you're not getting any sun um or you're

1579
01:00:37,798 --> 01:00:41,000
not getting any power from the Sun so

1580
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:43,240
now your light depth curtains are

1581
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:44,838
closing and it's acting as a basically

1582
01:00:43,239 --> 01:00:48,078
an indoor facility now and you're just

1583
01:00:44,838 --> 01:00:49,960
running 100% lights when those lights

1584
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:52,440
actually the lights in the dehumidifiers

1585
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:54,000
combined actually produce an amazing

1586
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:57,599
amount of heat even when they're LED

1587
01:00:54,000 --> 01:01:00,960
lights and for 10 months out of the year

1588
01:00:57,599 --> 01:01:03,280
we really don't use heaters too much at

1589
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:04,679
all or maybe a few times to heat it up

1590
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:06,640
in the morning you know what I mean and

1591
01:01:04,679 --> 01:01:08,919
get to temperature but for the bulk of

1592
01:01:06,639 --> 01:01:10,798
the day our equipment is producing

1593
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:12,639
enough heat that we're not venting that

1594
01:01:10,798 --> 01:01:14,519
it's carrying it so one of our first

1595
01:01:12,639 --> 01:01:17,239
steps on those cold days like when it's

1596
01:01:14,519 --> 01:01:19,480
we're talking 40 below during the day

1597
01:01:17,239 --> 01:01:20,919
and I don't care how much Sunshine we

1598
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:23,039
have when it's 40 below those curtains

1599
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:25,519
are closed I'm not taking that par

1600
01:01:23,039 --> 01:01:28,839
because I I'm heating too much in order

1601
01:01:25,519 --> 01:01:30,400
to to uh get that part so we had

1602
01:01:28,838 --> 01:01:32,599
Wadsworth and they're pretty awesome

1603
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:34,079
about just like oh what's your problem

1604
01:01:32,599 --> 01:01:36,559
no one's ever had that before let's do

1605
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:39,160
it they built us in a burp feature so

1606
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:42,240
what'll happen is the curtains

1607
01:01:39,159 --> 01:01:45,399
themselves will burp 5% they'll open 5%

1608
01:01:42,239 --> 01:01:47,118
when it gets to 83 degrees or 84 degrees

1609
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:49,280
and they'll just let a little bit of air

1610
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:52,278
up into that upper canopy above and then

1611
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:54,720
the then it just naturally um cools

1612
01:01:52,278 --> 01:01:56,358
because there's enough um heat loss

1613
01:01:54,719 --> 01:01:58,598
because it's a greenhouse

1614
01:01:56,358 --> 01:02:00,400
um that so that burp feature has given

1615
01:01:58,599 --> 01:02:03,680
us one more step in our there's a

1616
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:05,720
staging process of the the lowest

1617
01:02:03,679 --> 01:02:08,038
minimum tool for the job so it's first

1618
01:02:05,719 --> 01:02:10,639
it's a roof vent then it would be like a

1619
01:02:08,039 --> 01:02:12,240
condensate fan then a Gable fan um and

1620
01:02:10,639 --> 01:02:15,159
if the curtains are closed and all these

1621
01:02:12,239 --> 01:02:16,759
things have override so they don't um

1622
01:02:15,159 --> 01:02:19,000
interact with each other I don't want if

1623
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:20,799
my Gable exhaust vanand kicks on my roof

1624
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,599
vent needs to close it means the roof R

1625
01:02:20,798 --> 01:02:25,199
is not doing the job we've got too much

1626
01:02:22,599 --> 01:02:28,000
light coming in or too much um passive

1627
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:31,759
solar gain coming so and what I don't

1628
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:33,440
want is my roof vent sucking my Gable

1629
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:34,920
exhaust B kicks on and then sucks air

1630
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:36,400
through my roof V now that could one

1631
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:39,240
suck in bugs probably not because it's

1632
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:41,960
winter time but also I'm not sucking air

1633
01:02:39,239 --> 01:02:44,159
across the room anymore I'm short circu

1634
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:45,960
short circuiting all of this and I might

1635
01:02:44,159 --> 01:02:47,719
be just sucking air from the roof end on

1636
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:49,278
the west side to the fan on the west

1637
01:02:47,719 --> 01:02:51,239
side and I'm actually not cooling at all

1638
01:02:49,278 --> 01:02:55,000
you know what I mean so so it's all the

1639
01:02:51,239 --> 01:02:57,000
staging system with the Wadsworth having

1640
01:02:55,000 --> 01:03:00,278
um parameters and set points and what we

1641
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:03,079
call you know they um it's a what's the

1642
01:03:00,278 --> 01:03:05,920
word I'm looking for it's a a lockout

1643
01:03:03,079 --> 01:03:09,798
essentially uh Wadsworth will actually

1644
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:11,559
program in so that like just like my

1645
01:03:09,798 --> 01:03:13,199
exhaust fan can't be on at the same time

1646
01:03:11,559 --> 01:03:15,720
as my heater if an exhaust F opens the

1647
01:03:13,199 --> 01:03:17,679
heater turns off if a roof vent is open

1648
01:03:15,719 --> 01:03:19,798
and an exhaust van kicks on the roof

1649
01:03:17,679 --> 01:03:22,038
vent will close so there there and it's

1650
01:03:19,798 --> 01:03:24,920
a series of staging and all of this has

1651
01:03:22,039 --> 01:03:28,520
taken years and you could take my exact

1652
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:30,240
uh Sops for what my green houses are and

1653
01:03:28,519 --> 01:03:32,038
you could give them to someone and all a

1654
01:03:30,239 --> 01:03:33,439
sudden it's summertime well it's a

1655
01:03:32,039 --> 01:03:34,960
completely different mechanism and it's

1656
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:36,798
completely different Sops or you could

1657
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:38,960
give it to someone in Oregon or

1658
01:03:36,798 --> 01:03:41,119
Washington or Florida and none of that

1659
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:43,559
would make any sense at all um it has to

1660
01:03:41,119 --> 01:03:45,960
be very much specifically tailored to

1661
01:03:43,559 --> 01:03:47,119
Montana and then Montana's Seasons

1662
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:49,960
that's one of the biggest challenges we

1663
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:51,920
face is that you know we have some

1664
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:54,240
incredible sunlight in the summer and

1665
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:55,838
incredible temperatures and then

1666
01:03:54,239 --> 01:03:59,118
everything is opposite in the winter and

1667
01:03:55,838 --> 01:04:01,798
just like um in many ways indoor rooms

1668
01:03:59,119 --> 01:04:04,440
controllability and and stability makes

1669
01:04:01,798 --> 01:04:05,719
growing easy but it also makes your

1670
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:07,200
power bill High because a lot of these

1671
01:04:05,719 --> 01:04:09,519
guys I know are running air conditioners

1672
01:04:07,199 --> 01:04:11,118
in Montana in the winter time not us you

1673
01:04:09,519 --> 01:04:13,798
know what I mean our lights right now I

1674
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:15,519
bet you there's except for the mom room

1675
01:04:13,798 --> 01:04:17,519
and the vedro there's hardly a light on

1676
01:04:15,519 --> 01:04:21,000
in my whole facility right now today my

1677
01:04:17,519 --> 01:04:23,278
power bill per unit is incredibly low

1678
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:26,719
compared to any of my competitors here

1679
01:04:23,278 --> 01:04:28,838
in Montana and even my heating bill um I

1680
01:04:26,719 --> 01:04:30,759
think I only had a $800 natural gas

1681
01:04:28,838 --> 01:04:32,400
heating bill I shouldn't say only

1682
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:34,799
because it's still expensive but for a

1683
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:37,240
facility of this size in January when we

1684
01:04:34,798 --> 01:04:40,239
had a week of 50 below or a week of 40

1685
01:04:37,239 --> 01:04:42,239
plus below weather uh that's like

1686
01:04:40,239 --> 01:04:44,519
unbelievable and it shows you that my

1687
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:46,239
both my light depth curtains work really

1688
01:04:44,519 --> 01:04:47,559
well and my equipment everyone's

1689
01:04:46,239 --> 01:04:49,959
equipment produces a lot more heat than

1690
01:04:47,559 --> 01:04:52,200
they think even when it's LEDs dehes and

1691
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:54,920
and LEDs produce a ton of

1692
01:04:52,199 --> 01:04:58,038
heat so investing in the right

1693
01:04:54,920 --> 01:05:00,920
infrastructure has saved you a ton of

1694
01:04:58,039 --> 01:05:03,200
money and the right systems over the

1695
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:05,318
last you know few years since you've

1696
01:05:03,199 --> 01:05:06,838
since youve build out this facility and

1697
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:09,639
the other thing that I really want to

1698
01:05:06,838 --> 01:05:11,159
highlight is this idea of Sops because

1699
01:05:09,639 --> 01:05:12,920
people ask like what's the SOP for

1700
01:05:11,159 --> 01:05:15,440
growing you know and whether that's

1701
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:18,760
around IPM or in this case the

1702
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:21,400
greenhouse or uh fertility all of these

1703
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:23,760
things um what you said is really

1704
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:25,760
accurate you know every facility every

1705
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:27,559
space has different challenges different

1706
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:29,440
environment different things and so they

1707
01:05:27,559 --> 01:05:30,798
really need to be tailored customed to

1708
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:32,240
that space you can't just take someone's

1709
01:05:30,798 --> 01:05:33,759
sop and run with it and think you're

1710
01:05:32,239 --> 01:05:35,919
going to have a successful grow it just

1711
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:38,640
doesn't work that way there's no perfect

1712
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:40,960
method or grow setup it's extremely

1713
01:05:38,639 --> 01:05:42,879
customized and part of that EOS ENT

1714
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:44,519
operating system we were talking about

1715
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:47,599
not only do we have Sops but we have

1716
01:05:44,519 --> 01:05:49,798
like a core processes uh that this this

1717
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:52,559
all integrates the C the master calendar

1718
01:05:49,798 --> 01:05:54,079
with the core processes the Sops but the

1719
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:56,440
core processes had a little bit more

1720
01:05:54,079 --> 01:05:58,720
room for um

1721
01:05:56,440 --> 01:06:01,079
philosophy and like you know like if

1722
01:05:58,719 --> 01:06:03,118
this then that you just uh you know

1723
01:06:01,079 --> 01:06:06,599
here's I just need to teach you the

1724
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:08,119
concept and I also that also ties back

1725
01:06:06,599 --> 01:06:09,760
into having an amazing team that not

1726
01:06:08,119 --> 01:06:12,119
only can

1727
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:13,440
understand they have the capacity to

1728
01:06:12,119 --> 01:06:16,240
understand like what is what are we

1729
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:19,599
going for here not just this is the SOP

1730
01:06:16,239 --> 01:06:21,798
because the SOP changes from December to

1731
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:23,599
July so drastically that my team has to

1732
01:06:21,798 --> 01:06:25,880
actually understand like what are we

1733
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:27,519
going for here and then and then I mean

1734
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:30,240
that's That's essential but yeah Sops

1735
01:06:27,519 --> 01:06:32,318
are very much different summer to Winter

1736
01:06:30,239 --> 01:06:35,199
and of course the other common

1737
01:06:32,318 --> 01:06:37,199
denominator there is um I had to obsess

1738
01:06:35,199 --> 01:06:38,838
over it for years I mean literally at

1739
01:06:37,199 --> 01:06:41,358
before when I was stoking wood stoves at

1740
01:06:38,838 --> 01:06:44,278
midnight 3 and 6:00 a.m. well on that 40

1741
01:06:41,358 --> 01:06:45,558
below night uh in January you better

1742
01:06:44,278 --> 01:06:47,639
believe if I wake up and go to the

1743
01:06:45,559 --> 01:06:50,240
bathroom I am looking at my app and I'm

1744
01:06:47,639 --> 01:06:51,838
watching that I I unfortunately can

1745
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:54,879
never quite shed that and there's also

1746
01:06:51,838 --> 01:06:58,038
alarms built in so if the facility

1747
01:06:54,880 --> 01:07:00,680
temperature drops below 55° myself and

1748
01:06:58,039 --> 01:07:02,599
Danny get an alarm on our phones and the

1749
01:07:00,679 --> 01:07:05,519
alarm company actually calls us if it

1750
01:07:02,599 --> 01:07:07,798
gets above 88 we get a text then a phone

1751
01:07:05,519 --> 01:07:09,519
call um you know as soon and you don't

1752
01:07:07,798 --> 01:07:12,038
you want to set it so

1753
01:07:09,519 --> 01:07:13,358
that you know one wet wall is clogged

1754
01:07:12,039 --> 01:07:15,760
for one minute I don't need to get phone

1755
01:07:13,358 --> 01:07:18,480
calls all the time the second it hits 85

1756
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:19,920
degrees but you set it just below that

1757
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:23,039
parameter where it should never be which

1758
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:25,559
is like I said 55 and 88 if it's we got

1759
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:28,119
a problem and two of us are getting

1760
01:07:25,559 --> 01:07:30,000
phone calls after we get a text if

1761
01:07:28,119 --> 01:07:33,599
there's an issue and we're also like

1762
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:35,599
prepping for during that 40 below week

1763
01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:37,480
you're watching the weather and we're

1764
01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:39,838
also putting in backups we're testing

1765
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:41,240
our now now that we finally have a good

1766
01:07:39,838 --> 01:07:43,038
uh backup generator we're going to be

1767
01:07:41,239 --> 01:07:46,118
testing that but also we're going to

1768
01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:47,799
have staged out sunflower heaters with

1769
01:07:46,119 --> 01:07:49,480
propane next to every Greenhouse so that

1770
01:07:47,798 --> 01:07:51,400
in the off chance that the power does go

1771
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:53,318
out and the backup generator doesn't

1772
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:55,519
turn on you better believe I'll be there

1773
01:07:53,318 --> 01:07:57,079
at 3: in the morning and hopefully my

1774
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:58,480
team set me up for Success cuz I'm not

1775
01:07:57,079 --> 01:08:00,318
trying to call them at 3: in the morning

1776
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:02,679
I'll be there and I'll be lighting

1777
01:08:00,318 --> 01:08:04,599
heaters in those green houses and

1778
01:08:02,679 --> 01:08:06,118
hopefully those heaters are set there

1779
01:08:04,599 --> 01:08:09,200
and staged and ready that's like your

1780
01:08:06,119 --> 01:08:12,160
insurance policy you know what I

1781
01:08:09,199 --> 01:08:13,719
mean yeah yeah it's it's a lot and

1782
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:16,838
honestly one of the things as a business

1783
01:08:13,719 --> 01:08:18,559
owner that uh is really challenging that

1784
01:08:16,838 --> 01:08:20,960
no one really talks about is the fact

1785
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:22,520
that you never really get to shut off

1786
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:24,000
even if you're on vacation even if

1787
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:25,000
you're at home you know using the

1788
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,079
bathroom at 2: in the morning you're

1789
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,079
you're still thinking about your

1790
01:08:26,079 --> 01:08:30,000
business you're thinking about your

1791
01:08:27,079 --> 01:08:31,759
plants and uh you never really get that

1792
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:33,759
mental break and I think that's that's

1793
01:08:31,759 --> 01:08:35,399
hard and a lot of people don't consider

1794
01:08:33,759 --> 01:08:38,759
that when they think about setting up a

1795
01:08:35,399 --> 01:08:41,079
new uh a new business like this or being

1796
01:08:38,759 --> 01:08:42,640
a business owner it's well and and

1797
01:08:41,079 --> 01:08:44,679
trying to explain that to the crew

1798
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:48,000
because every day I would look at it as

1799
01:08:44,679 --> 01:08:49,600
I wake up and I take um basically I'm

1800
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,920
going to get my butt kicked three times

1801
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:52,920
I'm going to get three pieces of bad

1802
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:55,560
news today I guarantee they could be

1803
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:57,480
somewhere between $1,000 P pieces of bad

1804
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:59,440
news or $10,000 pieces of bad news but

1805
01:08:57,479 --> 01:09:01,039
I'm getting the news and you can absorb

1806
01:08:59,439 --> 01:09:02,559
the first one even if it's the 10,000 or

1807
01:09:01,039 --> 01:09:04,319
the 1,000 you're like it's good it's all

1808
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:06,560
good this was beyond your control

1809
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:07,920
nobody's fault here um how do we solve

1810
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:09,960
this how do we not have this happen

1811
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:13,119
again but by the third one even if it's

1812
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:15,279
the smallest one like all of your

1813
01:09:13,119 --> 01:09:17,278
ability to absorb bad news has now been

1814
01:09:15,279 --> 01:09:19,040
taken up and keeping your cool and and

1815
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:20,120
having them understand that's also why

1816
01:09:19,039 --> 01:09:22,039
it's good that they know you because

1817
01:09:20,119 --> 01:09:23,838
they know that yeah sometimes you're oh

1818
01:09:22,039 --> 01:09:25,880
he's a dick today he's pissed off like

1819
01:09:23,838 --> 01:09:27,880
well geez you guys look of these three

1820
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:30,440
things that happened to me today and I I

1821
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:32,279
lost my ability to absorb it's my shock

1822
01:09:30,439 --> 01:09:34,039
absorbers you know what I mean it's all

1823
01:09:32,279 --> 01:09:35,960
good I'm in a great mood it's 9:00 a.m.

1824
01:09:34,039 --> 01:09:38,479
got some bad news no worries don't worry

1825
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:39,960
about it but by like 3 o'clock piece

1826
01:09:38,479 --> 01:09:42,759
number five you're like are you kidding

1827
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:44,520
me wait what happened it's so hard to

1828
01:09:42,759 --> 01:09:48,198
but having your crew actually know you

1829
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:49,600
as a person and hopefully empathize with

1830
01:09:48,198 --> 01:09:51,000
that and then a little bit of that is

1831
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:53,798
like actually telling them what you're

1832
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:56,880
going through and of course apologizing

1833
01:09:53,798 --> 01:09:58,760
as best you can when um

1834
01:09:56,880 --> 01:10:00,199
when that does happen you're like hey

1835
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:01,520
here's what was happening here's why

1836
01:10:00,198 --> 01:10:03,039
that happened here's what we're going to

1837
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:05,880
do to fix that problem so it doesn't

1838
01:10:03,039 --> 01:10:07,319
happen again and now um rather than me

1839
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:08,640
be responsible for that I'm going to

1840
01:10:07,319 --> 01:10:09,759
assign that to one of my team members

1841
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:11,560
this is going out the accountability

1842
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:12,960
chart and now this is your job and so I

1843
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:14,480
want you to worry about it so that I

1844
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:18,319
don't have to because I can only worry

1845
01:10:14,479 --> 01:10:20,839
about so many things um and now our team

1846
01:10:18,319 --> 01:10:23,639
with the evolution of our core processes

1847
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:25,679
our Sops a team that truly cares and

1848
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:27,000
just we have just such an amazing team

1849
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:28,679
and somebody in each department that

1850
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:31,439
cares and is accountable for all this

1851
01:10:28,679 --> 01:10:34,199
stuff but back in the old days the first

1852
01:10:31,439 --> 01:10:35,559
few years you could track all of our I

1853
01:10:34,198 --> 01:10:37,000
don't want to say we ever had anything

1854
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:39,199
catastrophic happen but all of our

1855
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:41,079
biggest disasters you could track them

1856
01:10:39,198 --> 01:10:43,319
for the first three years with they

1857
01:10:41,079 --> 01:10:44,880
lined up directly with my vacations the

1858
01:10:43,319 --> 01:10:47,519
first time I ever was in Alaska on a

1859
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:50,199
camping trip out of reception literally

1860
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:52,520
they it was like clockwork and and

1861
01:10:50,198 --> 01:10:55,519
that's no one's fault per se it was that

1862
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:58,440
we didn't have systems in place and even

1863
01:10:55,520 --> 01:11:00,080
then the team cared but I didn't explain

1864
01:10:58,439 --> 01:11:01,479
to them those little things that I was

1865
01:11:00,079 --> 01:11:05,359
paying attention to in the middle of the

1866
01:11:01,479 --> 01:11:07,519
night or or even the concept of like oh

1867
01:11:05,359 --> 01:11:09,198
so many times the Cure is or the The

1868
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:12,239
Cure is worse than the disease like oh

1869
01:11:09,198 --> 01:11:14,399
no we found aphid so we root drenched

1870
01:11:12,238 --> 01:11:17,238
everything with insecticidal soap like

1871
01:11:14,399 --> 01:11:18,879
wait we what now um You didn't do it we

1872
01:11:17,238 --> 01:11:21,759
did a new treatment on an entire

1873
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:23,400
Greenhouse without triing it in a small

1874
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:25,560
section

1875
01:11:23,399 --> 01:11:28,198
first who gave the go- ahead on that

1876
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:30,880
while you were out of town [ __ ] okay now

1877
01:11:28,198 --> 01:11:32,678
it goes in the SOP anytime something new

1878
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:33,760
happens and now at a certain point I

1879
01:11:32,679 --> 01:11:35,000
keep saying this and this keeps not

1880
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:36,079
happening at this point my team's

1881
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,880
probably just rolling their eyes but

1882
01:11:36,079 --> 01:11:39,559
like eventually there won't be any new

1883
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:41,719
problems to have we'll have had all the

1884
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:45,239
problems and so someone will know whose

1885
01:11:41,719 --> 01:11:48,439
job it is and we'll have a quiver of

1886
01:11:45,238 --> 01:11:50,079
options to solve that and eventually and

1887
01:11:48,439 --> 01:11:52,759
this is already happening as I've uh

1888
01:11:50,079 --> 01:11:55,600
phased into office life now I still do

1889
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:57,560
my daily walkthrough every single day

1890
01:11:55,600 --> 01:12:00,159
but unless there's an emergency or a

1891
01:11:57,560 --> 01:12:02,039
large scale problem I'm into the office

1892
01:12:00,158 --> 01:12:04,119
and onto accounting and my team can

1893
01:12:02,039 --> 01:12:06,600
handle all of this stuff but back in the

1894
01:12:04,119 --> 01:12:09,399
old days it was two to three to four

1895
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:11,840
hours of me being this now I have a

1896
01:12:09,399 --> 01:12:13,638
sawyer my IPM manager he's doing The

1897
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:15,639
Scouting he's got the eye you can't buy

1898
01:12:13,639 --> 01:12:17,960
the eye you have to have the eye and the

1899
01:12:15,639 --> 01:12:21,639
only way to get the eye is years and

1900
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:23,719
years of like developing the now I have

1901
01:12:21,639 --> 01:12:25,880
some people uh Jared too my the guy who

1902
01:12:23,719 --> 01:12:29,039
does all our soil fertility and stuff

1903
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:30,319
um he came from you know a school

1904
01:12:29,039 --> 01:12:33,238
background and didn't have a ton of

1905
01:12:30,319 --> 01:12:35,799
cannabis experience but now just

1906
01:12:33,238 --> 01:12:38,198
recently he's been impressing Me by

1907
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:39,840
finding stuff before I find it he's got

1908
01:12:38,198 --> 01:12:42,198
the eye now too you know what I mean

1909
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:44,400
like I said you can't like um you can't

1910
01:12:42,198 --> 01:12:47,079
even you can teach it but you can't

1911
01:12:44,399 --> 01:12:50,158
teach it today you can't put it in an so

1912
01:12:47,079 --> 01:12:51,920
the eye has to come with time um yeah so

1913
01:12:50,158 --> 01:12:55,359
that's where

1914
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:57,560
uh now I finally feel comfortable not

1915
01:12:55,359 --> 01:13:00,639
spending 3 hours a day talking to

1916
01:12:57,560 --> 01:13:03,840
everybody about uh theoretical growing

1917
01:13:00,639 --> 01:13:05,319
conceptual stuff if this then that um

1918
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:07,840
that's another thing is the Instinct

1919
01:13:05,319 --> 01:13:09,079
that um you know if you listen to all of

1920
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:12,279
the people that you've had on your

1921
01:13:09,079 --> 01:13:13,960
podcast you have an amazing resume of

1922
01:13:12,279 --> 01:13:15,920
some of the best people not just in this

1923
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:18,600
industry but in the world from a science

1924
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:20,840
perspective like it's unmatched

1925
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:22,679
unparalleled me nor none of my people on

1926
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:25,400
my team can hold the candle to those

1927
01:13:22,679 --> 01:13:27,440
guys' specific things but first first of

1928
01:13:25,399 --> 01:13:30,359
all they're willing to learn and listen

1929
01:13:27,439 --> 01:13:32,039
to what those guys are saying and then

1930
01:13:30,359 --> 01:13:33,759
there's something to be said about not

1931
01:13:32,039 --> 01:13:36,920
only that Steady Hand but there's an

1932
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:38,320
instinct there's a this plant is healthy

1933
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:40,679
and I know it and I don't care what you

1934
01:13:38,319 --> 01:13:41,960
say about uh if a Praying plant you guys

1935
01:13:40,679 --> 01:13:44,199
can argue all you want about whether

1936
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:46,198
praying is bad or stressful for plants

1937
01:13:44,198 --> 01:13:47,238
but I know what it does to yield and I

1938
01:13:46,198 --> 01:13:49,879
don't really care about the science

1939
01:13:47,238 --> 01:13:53,000
behind it at a certain point I feel and

1940
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:54,359
have seen and know the results um and

1941
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,760
that's something that you can't really

1942
01:13:54,359 --> 01:13:58,000
like um

1943
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:59,719
College doesn't teach that that standing

1944
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:02,158
in a room with someone and being like

1945
01:13:59,719 --> 01:14:03,880
does it feel too humid in here you

1946
01:14:02,158 --> 01:14:06,719
that's like a feeling it's that six

1947
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:09,760
sense it's that magic the ninja [ __ ]

1948
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:12,639
that you cannot buy or or train into

1949
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:15,079
people except by spending tens of

1950
01:14:12,639 --> 01:14:16,679
thousands of hours in a greenhouse and

1951
01:14:15,079 --> 01:14:18,198
and overcoming all these problems and

1952
01:14:16,679 --> 01:14:20,199
that's like my

1953
01:14:18,198 --> 01:14:22,638
team either they're there or they're

1954
01:14:20,198 --> 01:14:25,839
almost there I

1955
01:14:22,639 --> 01:14:29,039
hope yeah I love that uh and I think to

1956
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:31,400
a team member that finds a problem and

1957
01:14:29,039 --> 01:14:32,880
then brings it to you along with some

1958
01:14:31,399 --> 01:14:35,599
potential

1959
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:36,840
Solutions is worth a million times more

1960
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:40,320
than a team member that just comes to

1961
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:44,079
you with a problem um as as a business

1962
01:14:40,319 --> 01:14:45,158
owner that is priceless um and you may

1963
01:14:44,079 --> 01:14:46,719
not go with their solution and they need

1964
01:14:45,158 --> 01:14:48,119
to be okay with that because you may

1965
01:14:46,719 --> 01:14:49,279
have more information that they may not

1966
01:14:48,119 --> 01:14:51,039
have access to or you may have

1967
01:14:49,279 --> 01:14:53,000
experience in your facility that you

1968
01:14:51,039 --> 01:14:55,158
know they haven't had but being able to

1969
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:57,719
talk it through with them and for them

1970
01:14:55,158 --> 01:14:59,920
to be able to bring insight to the

1971
01:14:57,719 --> 01:15:01,880
problem that you don't have is

1972
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:05,279
absolutely the I think one of the most

1973
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:08,760
important uh aspects of a of a team

1974
01:15:05,279 --> 01:15:10,119
member you're 100% te and then you you

1975
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:12,199
have to have people obviously who are

1976
01:15:10,119 --> 01:15:14,279
smart competent and you know have common

1977
01:15:12,198 --> 01:15:17,158
sense but then even teaching them how to

1978
01:15:14,279 --> 01:15:18,800
think uh with that mentality and and

1979
01:15:17,158 --> 01:15:20,238
even throwing that throwing those

1980
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:22,639
problems back to them like all right

1981
01:15:20,238 --> 01:15:24,759
well there's no easy solutions but yeah

1982
01:15:22,639 --> 01:15:26,840
come to me with these Sol just exactly

1983
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:28,800
what said that's super essential is and

1984
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:29,960
it also is empowering to them because

1985
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:31,960
now they're not going to come to you

1986
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:33,679
next time with just a problem they're

1987
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:34,920
going to come with a couple of solutions

1988
01:15:33,679 --> 01:15:37,119
like you said you don't have to do it

1989
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:40,279
but you've now empowered them uh

1990
01:15:37,119 --> 01:15:42,079
retrained them how to think and and

1991
01:15:40,279 --> 01:15:43,599
eventually they've already walked

1992
01:15:42,079 --> 01:15:46,119
through this system this process that

1993
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:47,679
you've done a million times and and now

1994
01:15:46,119 --> 01:15:49,119
they do it without we don't even have to

1995
01:15:47,679 --> 01:15:51,840
bother him this time because he's busy

1996
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:53,880
today because we only have three options

1997
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:56,119
and it's either it's because of the

1998
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:58,400
Season or the severity of the problem

1999
01:15:56,119 --> 01:16:00,439
but we know that this is our go-to this

2000
01:15:58,399 --> 01:16:01,920
is our first step this is our second

2001
01:16:00,439 --> 01:16:04,439
step if this problem progresses and then

2002
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:05,880
this is our third step and they and then

2003
01:16:04,439 --> 01:16:07,479
hopefully as long as you're evolving

2004
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:09,760
your Sops and core

2005
01:16:07,479 --> 01:16:11,559
processes you should write that new

2006
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:14,880
problem in every time that is an issue

2007
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:17,679
you got to like um not only fix it but

2008
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:19,639
what if that person is um incapacitated

2009
01:16:17,679 --> 01:16:22,440
for a day what if they're sick that day

2010
01:16:19,639 --> 01:16:24,319
like you got to have like you got to

2011
01:16:22,439 --> 01:16:27,158
continue to evolve your Sops they don't

2012
01:16:24,319 --> 01:16:31,079
just stay put you have to to update them

2013
01:16:27,158 --> 01:16:33,319
regularly yes yes um all right the last

2014
01:16:31,079 --> 01:16:35,840
thing I want to touch on in this call is

2015
01:16:33,319 --> 01:16:38,119
the praying leaves thing because I think

2016
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:39,600
um I I had no idea I was opening such a

2017
01:16:38,119 --> 01:16:41,760
can of worms and basically what happened

2018
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:44,199
for people who missed it is on uh

2019
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:47,480
Instagram I posted a photo of one of my

2020
01:16:44,198 --> 01:16:49,279
plants and it was praying what we call

2021
01:16:47,479 --> 01:16:52,919
praying leaves so let's call it a 45

2022
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:55,840
degree maybe 60° Leaf Angle an upward

2023
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:58,719
trajectory and I was I was speculating

2024
01:16:55,840 --> 01:17:01,239
that this might be a less than optimal

2025
01:16:58,719 --> 01:17:03,079
angle for like a solar panel for you

2026
01:17:01,238 --> 01:17:06,799
know photosynthesis and why would a

2027
01:17:03,079 --> 01:17:08,600
plant do this uh and everyone uh not

2028
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:10,079
everyone a lot of people jumped on me

2029
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:11,639
for that saying you know praying leaves

2030
01:17:10,079 --> 01:17:15,158
means your plant's healthy it's it's

2031
01:17:11,639 --> 01:17:17,159
related to uh the turer the pressure in

2032
01:17:15,158 --> 01:17:20,879
the leaf in the stem that creates that

2033
01:17:17,158 --> 01:17:23,119
angle and I wasn't arguing that it was

2034
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:25,000
bad I was just trying to get behind the

2035
01:17:23,119 --> 01:17:27,079
mechanism of what might cause it and

2036
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:29,039
basically what I learned in that process

2037
01:17:27,079 --> 01:17:32,238
is that many of the mechanisms around it

2038
01:17:29,039 --> 01:17:33,760
related to like hydrology and and things

2039
01:17:32,238 --> 01:17:36,638
like that are actually quite positive so

2040
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:39,639
it can be a sign of a healthy plant but

2041
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:42,079
I also have found that it may be a sign

2042
01:17:39,639 --> 01:17:43,960
of low CO2 and that plant is trying to

2043
01:17:42,079 --> 01:17:48,559
raise the leaf angle as a way of getting

2044
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:50,399
more uh CO2 to the stomata or um I've

2045
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:52,600
seen it with plants that are quite

2046
01:17:50,399 --> 01:17:54,359
unhealthy with tissue tests that show

2047
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:56,800
they're very low infertility yet they're

2048
01:17:54,359 --> 01:17:58,799
still PR pring uh which just I think I

2049
01:17:56,800 --> 01:18:01,159
think the big consensus I came to was

2050
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:04,600
that it's not

2051
01:18:01,158 --> 01:18:06,960
necessarily um there's many there's many

2052
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:09,320
modes of action that can cause this

2053
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:11,119
turgidity in the leaf many of which are

2054
01:18:09,319 --> 01:18:15,119
beneficial and many of which could be a

2055
01:18:11,119 --> 01:18:17,279
sign of plant stress so I think my big

2056
01:18:15,119 --> 01:18:18,679
takeaway was it's not necessarily a good

2057
01:18:17,279 --> 01:18:20,479
or bad thing it's a thing a plant does

2058
01:18:18,679 --> 01:18:22,920
in response to certain environmental

2059
01:18:20,479 --> 01:18:25,279
factors many of which are beneficial

2060
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:27,920
some of which could be detrimental

2061
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:30,000
but um yeah yeah I didn't mean to throw

2062
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:32,800
you under the bus or open it was a good

2063
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:35,439
chance to explain it yeah I just want to

2064
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:37,199
like yeah sometimes because every grow

2065
01:18:35,439 --> 01:18:40,158
is different and everything you

2066
01:18:37,198 --> 01:18:42,759
know the soil doctor cannot give me or

2067
01:18:40,158 --> 01:18:45,000
you for that matter either exactly a

2068
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:48,159
recipe for what my plants need in my

2069
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:49,800
specific area at a certain point and

2070
01:18:48,158 --> 01:18:51,759
also if you bring in somebody who's way

2071
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:53,400
more knowledgeable they can only do so

2072
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:56,560
much if your plants don't have Baseline

2073
01:18:53,399 --> 01:18:58,039
Health well okay there's like 10 steps

2074
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:59,159
we got to do before we even get to there

2075
01:18:58,039 --> 01:19:01,840
what are we going to progress but the

2076
01:18:59,158 --> 01:19:05,158
point is like there's no one gun quiver

2077
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:08,360
there's no uh prescription to that fits

2078
01:19:05,158 --> 01:19:09,799
everything and sometimes I have to take

2079
01:19:08,359 --> 01:19:12,359
stuff that people that are far more

2080
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:15,119
knowledgeable than me tell me with a

2081
01:19:12,359 --> 01:19:16,839
grain of salt like this plant might have

2082
01:19:15,119 --> 01:19:18,039
uh this this and this deficiencies and

2083
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:19,800
you can tell because its leaves are

2084
01:19:18,039 --> 01:19:21,238
yellow but that doesn't mean the soil is

2085
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:23,800
deficient that just actually means that

2086
01:19:21,238 --> 01:19:25,519
we underwatered it this last week and

2087
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:27,239
it's not available you know you see all

2088
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:28,560
this like we'll sit there and argue to

2089
01:19:27,238 --> 01:19:32,039
we blue in the face about what's wrong

2090
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:33,960
with this plant and actually it's dry

2091
01:19:32,039 --> 01:19:36,519
you know could uptake the nutrients in

2092
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:38,560
the soil that's a good point so I've

2093
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:40,600
already taken a lot of your time I feel

2094
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:42,159
like we could we could talk for hours I

2095
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:43,760
would love to get you back on because I

2096
01:19:42,158 --> 01:19:45,920
just made a list of topics of things we

2097
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:48,679
didn't even get to like fertility

2098
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:50,760
irrigation drying curing genetics your

2099
01:19:48,679 --> 01:19:53,279
marketing and branding and also your IPM

2100
01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:55,280
those are all things I would love to get

2101
01:19:53,279 --> 01:19:56,599
uh a little bit of insight from you on

2102
01:19:55,279 --> 01:19:58,800
because I think what you shared today

2103
01:19:56,600 --> 01:20:00,679
was really great well and if that's the

2104
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:03,279
case I'd love to uh get the team on

2105
01:20:00,679 --> 01:20:05,639
there because so my IPM manager has now

2106
01:20:03,279 --> 01:20:08,519
taken this picked up where I left off a

2107
01:20:05,639 --> 01:20:10,560
few years ago and not that I'm not um

2108
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:13,000
involved in the weekly meetings and

2109
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:15,840
conversations of what's going on but

2110
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:18,079
he's really you know Jared has taken the

2111
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:20,679
soil prescriptions and the soil tests

2112
01:20:18,079 --> 01:20:23,279
and he's taken it to the next level from

2113
01:20:20,679 --> 01:20:26,199
where I left off uh Danny obviously has

2114
01:20:23,279 --> 01:20:30,479
always taken the design engineering and

2115
01:20:26,198 --> 01:20:32,839
and um in Innovative nature of

2116
01:20:30,479 --> 01:20:35,359
facilities design

2117
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:37,440
and not that him and I don't go back and

2118
01:20:35,359 --> 01:20:40,839
forth more than anyone on what we're

2119
01:20:37,439 --> 01:20:42,000
doing but uh he's really got I if if

2120
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:43,880
we're going to do that I'm happy to

2121
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:46,198
bring on different members of the team

2122
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:47,880
or even parts of it uh you know what

2123
01:20:46,198 --> 01:20:50,519
what Connor's done in my propagation

2124
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:53,480
Department uh what Alejandro and and

2125
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:55,400
Kyle have done for the uh leafing and

2126
01:20:53,479 --> 01:20:57,479
harvests and efficiency and reducing

2127
01:20:55,399 --> 01:21:00,599
touch points and stuff like that and

2128
01:20:57,479 --> 01:21:02,799
then just all of them are I mean if you

2129
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:04,520
think about it like Connor takes more

2130
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:07,800
clones in a month than I've ever taken

2131
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:10,120
in my entire life and yet you know I've

2132
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:11,679
now grown I guess I don't know if you

2133
01:21:10,119 --> 01:21:14,840
don't necessarily give me credit for it

2134
01:21:11,679 --> 01:21:17,480
but tens of thousands of pounds of weed

2135
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:19,360
but I haven't taken a clone that's not

2136
01:21:17,479 --> 01:21:21,599
true I do at my R&amp;D shop a little bit

2137
01:21:19,359 --> 01:21:25,599
but you know the point is like each of

2138
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:28,320
my teammates or team members have done

2139
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:29,920
each of their individual tasks a hundred

2140
01:21:28,319 --> 01:21:31,559
times more than me now and the only

2141
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:34,199
thing that I do is

2142
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:35,840
like keep tabs and stay informed on it

2143
01:21:34,198 --> 01:21:37,479
so if we want to get in depth on any one

2144
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:38,840
of those topics I need to like bring on

2145
01:21:37,479 --> 01:21:41,079
the team because that's how you evolve a

2146
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:42,520
facility like this is by letting and

2147
01:21:41,079 --> 01:21:44,279
just like any good businessman will tell

2148
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:45,520
you you hire people that are better than

2149
01:21:44,279 --> 01:21:48,198
you and I'm not even saying all of them

2150
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:50,320
were better but they are now holy cows

2151
01:21:48,198 --> 01:21:52,158
they're you know these guys are are you

2152
01:21:50,319 --> 01:21:54,920
know like I said they're snipers they're

2153
01:21:52,158 --> 01:21:56,960
rock stars and

2154
01:21:54,920 --> 01:21:58,679
they've got a lot of practice and I but

2155
01:21:56,960 --> 01:22:00,399
I would love to talk about like the R&amp;D

2156
01:21:58,679 --> 01:22:03,560
facility because I do a lot of cool

2157
01:22:00,399 --> 01:22:06,039
breeding projects and honestly a lot of

2158
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:08,840
this other stuff is kind of it gets

2159
01:22:06,039 --> 01:22:09,719
monotonous compliance and the world and

2160
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:11,920
stuff

2161
01:22:09,719 --> 01:22:13,679
all yeah people get into growing weed

2162
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:15,480
because they think like oh I Love Weed

2163
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:17,840
let's do it and it is it's exciting it's

2164
01:22:15,479 --> 01:22:21,879
fun but like there's still a ton of

2165
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:23,520
repetition um my R&amp;D facility I still

2166
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:26,000
get excited about going there every

2167
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:27,880
single morning and check in and it's

2168
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:31,079
still fun I still get to do the parts of

2169
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:33,319
the job that I love cuz it the it's hard

2170
01:22:31,079 --> 01:22:34,719
to quantify or make that facility pencil

2171
01:22:33,319 --> 01:22:36,399
out even though it's pretty cheap to run

2172
01:22:34,719 --> 01:22:37,840
you know I might spend 150 or 200 Grand

2173
01:22:36,399 --> 01:22:39,920
a year with you know the salary the

2174
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:43,239
power the rent

2175
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:45,119
everything but God it puts a smile on my

2176
01:22:43,238 --> 01:22:47,519
face just like doing new breeding

2177
01:22:45,119 --> 01:22:51,399
projects and making seeds and and seeing

2178
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:53,360
new fenos and and and also it doesn't um

2179
01:22:51,399 --> 01:22:55,079
beat me down oh we had a hermy and that

2180
01:22:53,359 --> 01:22:56,960
whole room got seated

2181
01:22:55,079 --> 01:22:58,439
Ah that's what it's for blast it you

2182
01:22:56,960 --> 01:23:01,119
know what I mean it doesn't you know

2183
01:22:58,439 --> 01:23:04,158
versus catastrophic failure in a large

2184
01:23:01,119 --> 01:23:05,679
scale Greenhouse so yeah uh I'm happy to

2185
01:23:04,158 --> 01:23:07,238
continue this conversation but I would

2186
01:23:05,679 --> 01:23:08,920
like to maybe bring on the individual

2187
01:23:07,238 --> 01:23:11,238
team members to give them their credit

2188
01:23:08,920 --> 01:23:15,199
and also so that you can actually go

2189
01:23:11,238 --> 01:23:17,000
down the rabbit hole um just even you

2190
01:23:15,198 --> 01:23:18,879
can't keep track of every single

2191
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:20,920
treatment and every single thing at this

2192
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:22,520
scale I I mean I can give you the

2193
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:24,960
overview and the master calendar and I

2194
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:27,040
can do everything but my people have now

2195
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:29,198
really taking it to the next level and

2196
01:23:27,039 --> 01:23:31,238
and that's where you got to bring them

2197
01:23:29,198 --> 01:23:33,198
in or do like 15 minute segments with

2198
01:23:31,238 --> 01:23:34,638
each person or something of that nature

2199
01:23:33,198 --> 01:23:36,759
I I would love to set that up that would

2200
01:23:34,639 --> 01:23:40,000
be great yeah I mean it's been it's been

2201
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:42,360
a pleasure working with you um over the

2202
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:45,560
last few years and I don't even know

2203
01:23:42,359 --> 01:23:47,319
when we first started talking but um

2204
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:48,800
getting to come out and see the facility

2205
01:23:47,319 --> 01:23:50,960
meet the team meet a lot of the people

2206
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:52,600
in the Boseman area and the community I

2207
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:53,920
I loved the community there when I came

2208
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:56,120
out and the fact you were you know you

2209
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:58,158
gave tours and everything and really are

2210
01:23:56,119 --> 01:23:59,519
opened it up to even competitors to come

2211
01:23:58,158 --> 01:24:01,479
and see what you guys were doing I

2212
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:03,560
thought was really uh really

2213
01:24:01,479 --> 01:24:05,198
commendable thank you we appreciate that

2214
01:24:03,560 --> 01:24:07,320
and that that's a step in the right

2215
01:24:05,198 --> 01:24:08,719
direction too we have a right now we've

2216
01:24:07,319 --> 01:24:11,639
got a living soil Alliance here in

2217
01:24:08,719 --> 01:24:13,480
Montana so uh that's kind of a all of us

2218
01:24:11,639 --> 01:24:14,319
living soil Growers trying to band

2219
01:24:13,479 --> 01:24:17,439
together

2220
01:24:14,319 --> 01:24:18,880
to uh educate the consumers so that look

2221
01:24:17,439 --> 01:24:20,279
if you're shopping at the co-op but you

2222
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:22,880
don't care what's in your

2223
01:24:20,279 --> 01:24:26,079
weed you you just don't know any better

2224
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:27,560
if we can educate the consumers to uh as

2225
01:24:26,079 --> 01:24:29,439
far as I'm concerned and for a while we

2226
01:24:27,560 --> 01:24:30,960
used to have that same mentality of like

2227
01:24:29,439 --> 01:24:32,799
Secrets let's keep everything guarded

2228
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:34,239
let's not tell everyone what we're doing

2229
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:36,719
and then for after a while it's like you

2230
01:24:34,238 --> 01:24:38,599
know what first of all imitation is a

2231
01:24:36,719 --> 01:24:40,639
form of flattery second if the whole

2232
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:42,840
world grew with living soil Su grown

2233
01:24:40,639 --> 01:24:44,560
cannabis Well we'd all be better off

2234
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:47,159
from a carbon footprint standpoint and

2235
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:49,760
so would I be jealous about that hell no

2236
01:24:47,158 --> 01:24:50,960
I wouldn't um Might Sting for a second

2237
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:52,679
because someone copied you but then

2238
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:54,719
you're like no what's that's not what

2239
01:24:52,679 --> 01:24:56,440
this is all about this is all about like

2240
01:24:54,719 --> 01:24:58,118
sustain my my degrees are in

2241
01:24:56,439 --> 01:24:59,759
conservation biology natural resource

2242
01:24:58,118 --> 01:25:01,799
ecology Wilderness management I was a

2243
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:03,679
Wilderness Ranger for 10 years like this

2244
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:05,480
is a core tenant a principle of the

2245
01:25:03,679 --> 01:25:07,639
foundation of this company was

2246
01:25:05,479 --> 01:25:11,079
sustainability and it's easy to forget

2247
01:25:07,639 --> 01:25:13,520
that when you're drowning in compliance

2248
01:25:11,079 --> 01:25:16,198
and day-to-day and bookkeeping and all

2249
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:18,679
the nonsense but every once in a while

2250
01:25:16,198 --> 01:25:20,719
you do remember that like man that's a

2251
01:25:18,679 --> 01:25:22,800
that's a founding principle of our

2252
01:25:20,719 --> 01:25:23,920
company so first of all I'd love to do

2253
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:24,840
that again if you're ever back in

2254
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:26,319
Montana

2255
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:28,319
um and I was talking about just doing

2256
01:25:26,319 --> 01:25:30,679
that having like a living soil Alliance

2257
01:25:28,319 --> 01:25:31,759
day and doing the same thing and opening

2258
01:25:30,679 --> 01:25:35,520
up the

2259
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:37,320
facility and also you know what it it it

2260
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:38,600
took the edge off for so long all of our

2261
01:25:37,319 --> 01:25:40,118
competitors we were just competing

2262
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:41,920
against each other but like yeah let's

2263
01:25:40,118 --> 01:25:44,519
bring it in we are a community we're all

2264
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:46,399
facing the same struggles like let's

2265
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:48,440
talk about them and and it's liberating

2266
01:25:46,399 --> 01:25:50,399
in a sense like hey here's the problems

2267
01:25:48,439 --> 01:25:52,079
I have today look here's a spot of

2268
01:25:50,399 --> 01:25:53,759
mildew here's what I'm doing to address

2269
01:25:52,079 --> 01:25:54,880
it here's what I've done in the past to

2270
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:57,199
address it

2271
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:59,480
uh not be like don't tell anyone that I

2272
01:25:57,198 --> 01:26:02,079
had some mildew oh my God you know and

2273
01:25:59,479 --> 01:26:04,039
of course as you know when you post that

2274
01:26:02,079 --> 01:26:06,279
stuff online then the closet Growers

2275
01:26:04,039 --> 01:26:07,880
come out in full force about I'd be more

2276
01:26:06,279 --> 01:26:09,960
worried about that purple stem if I were

2277
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:11,359
you it's like ah gez man go back to your

2278
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:13,880
closet I'm just trying to do a good

2279
01:26:11,359 --> 01:26:15,079
thing here and that's the LED lights and

2280
01:26:13,880 --> 01:26:17,600
it's hard for me not to take it

2281
01:26:15,079 --> 01:26:18,800
personally because I care so much but at

2282
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:20,719
the same time

2283
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:22,360
like you don't have to worry about the

2284
01:26:20,719 --> 01:26:25,840
chatter of the closet Growers you just

2285
01:26:22,359 --> 01:26:27,960
do your best but but for us to like uh

2286
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:30,000
We've scaled to this level and as far as

2287
01:26:27,960 --> 01:26:32,359
I know as far as I can tell we haven't

2288
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:33,840
lost a bit on our quality now I don't

2289
01:26:32,359 --> 01:26:36,198
think we can continue to scale that

2290
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:39,000
another thing we got to talk about is

2291
01:26:36,198 --> 01:26:40,919
um how many rooms you can have

2292
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:43,118
efficiently to have a high utilization

2293
01:26:40,920 --> 01:26:45,840
rate like just facility design man

2294
01:26:43,118 --> 01:26:48,039
there's a lot to that um anyways we

2295
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:51,199

2296
01:26:48,039 --> 01:26:53,479

over my soil when I was making it so I
