00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,280
show hi dr russo thank you for coming on

49
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,118
the show today

50
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,759
pleasure

51
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:04,560
really appreciate it i uh i wanted to

52
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,799
ask you some questions uh regarding some

53
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,878
of your more recent research

54
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,599
i know you've done some work with jeremy

55
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:13,039
plum who was recently on the podcast i

56
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:14,878
thought maybe we could start off talking

57
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:16,479
a little bit about that

58
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:18,719
sure that'd be great

59
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:20,479
do you want to explain some of the uh

60
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:22,159
methodology

61
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:23,439
and what you were looking to accomplish

62
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:25,759
with jeremy

63
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:27,840
yeah so what we were doing was uh

64
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:31,519
testing out a novel solventless

65
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:34,159
extraction technique uh the idea being

66
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:36,719
to try and preserve can cannabinoid

67
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:39,039
particularly terpenoid content

68
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:41,280
of fresh flour

69
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:44,400
and i should point out that

70
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,239
the source article is open source

71
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,519
it's available

72
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,840
online

73
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,599
at

74
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:54,239
ethanrusso.org if people just hit the

75
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:56,878
library tab it'll be about the second

76
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,360
article down so it's called novel

77
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:01,518
solventless extraction technique

78
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:05,680
to preserve cannabinoid and terpenoid

79
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:07,280
profiles of fresh cannabis inflorescence

80
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,800
and um

81
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:15,039
so basically that was the idea um

82
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:16,640
what i was doing was operating under the

83
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:19,598
feeling that

84
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:22,719
um the standard way of presenting

85
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:25,280
cannabis is to try and cure it and this

86
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:26,639
is based on the idea that everyone is

87
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,280
going to smoke it

88
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:32,479
but that isn't always the case

89
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:35,479
um it's been known for many years that

90
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:37,759
you lose up to 50 percent of the

91
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:40,798
monoterpenoid content so this would be

92
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:43,840
the lower molecular weight turbinoids

93
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:46,319
the so-called headspace volatiles that

94
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,878
are going to be what you smell when

95
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:50,958
you're in the vicinity

96
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:51,759
of a cannabis plant

97
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,598
so

98
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:54,798
in drying and curing

99
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:58,158
you're losing

100
00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:00,080
50 of those now if you're a person like

101
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:01,759
me that believes that they're part of

102
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,360
the entourage

103
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:07,598
of uh cannabis chemicals that contribute

104
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,200
to therapeutic effects that doesn't make

105
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:11,839
a lot of sense

106
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:14,158
so what we're doing is for the sake of

107
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,879
so-called smoke ability we're

108
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:21,199
squandering these important components

109
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:24,000
on not just smell and taste but effect

110
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,439
so i wanted to develop a technique that

111
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,800
would preserve

112
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:32,160
the profile of the fresh flower

113
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,918
as you see it growing

114
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,439
and this involves

115
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:38,319
exposure of the fresh cut flower

116
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:42,079
to

117
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:43,599
co2 vapor from dry ice

118
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:45,240
and

119
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,680
we were hoping it would be sort of a

120
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,840
lyophilization freeze drying effect as

121
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,800
well get rid of some of the water

122
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:55,039
apparently some of it remains however we

123
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:59,680
did succeed quite well

124
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:02,400
in demonstrating a marked concentration

125
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,120
of the components we could kick

126
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:06,079
the

127
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,120
cannabinoid content upwards of 60

128
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:08,639
percent

129
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,439
in some cases

130
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,840
and

131
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:15,038
basically double or triple

132
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:18,159
the terpenoid fraction um

133
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:20,478
as compared to the fresh flower

134
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,360
so what you end up with is

135
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:26,478
what the moroccans term keef

136
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,960
basically separating the trichomes

137
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:30,719
from the rest of the plant material

138
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:34,879
now when it comes to cannabis

139
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:37,280
therapeutics aside from roots and some

140
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:38,399
things that occur in the

141
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:41,198
leaves

142
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:42,319
to greater extent than in the flower

143
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,439
when

144
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:45,360
usually

145
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:47,680
we're most interested in the

146
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,280
cannabinoids and

147
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,840
terpenoids

148
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:54,159
that occur in the trichomes and the rest

149
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:59,279
of what's in the flower is really

150
00:05:54,160 --> 00:06:02,800
extraneous so you do have a bunch of

151
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:05,198
cell wall ballast that's sort of fatty

152
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:08,079
you've got chlorophyll which you don't

153
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,840
need for therapeutic effects and then

154
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:13,198
there's all the

155
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:15,198
woody material um so basically you're

156
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,439
getting down to the nitty-gritty of

157
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,520
what's needed medicinally if you're just

158
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:21,519
looking at trichomes and that's

159
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:22,799
basically the reason that there's been

160
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:26,318
hashish

161
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,800
for thousands of years our ancestors in

162
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:31,199
the middle east figured out a long time

163
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,038
ago that the real action

164
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,879
was in the trichomes even if they

165
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:36,079
couldn't see them at the time they knew

166
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:37,918
how to

167
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:40,478
separate them from the rest of the

168
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:42,318
biomass and create this concentrated

169
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:45,038
product

170
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:48,560
so this is a sort of modern type of

171
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:52,000
hashish or keef um

172
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:55,038
but um it was really important to me

173
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,598
that we do this with material that was

174
00:06:55,038 --> 00:07:00,399
organically grown and under control

175
00:06:57,598 --> 00:07:03,360
conditions so that's where jeremy plum

176
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:06,239
came in because he has what to my

177
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,199
knowledge is the most sophisticated

178
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,519
indoor

179
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:14,000
controllable organic regenerative

180
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:17,359
approach to cannabis culture that i've

181
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,879
ever seen and believe me i've seen a lot

182
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:23,520
between working at gw and having visited

183
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:24,719
numerous of the licensed producers in

184
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:28,719
canada

185
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:30,319
um in the netherlands etc

186
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,800
so there are plenty of people growing

187
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,720
cannabis they're very few that i think

188
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,120
are growing it the way i'd like to see

189
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,120
it done

190
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:42,079
so with this process

191
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:43,120
um

192
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:45,439
how

193
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:48,720
practical do you see this scaling

194
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:51,038
commercially if it's a more efficient

195
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,680
way of preserving

196
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:55,360
uh you know terpenes and

197
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,038
and everything in the process well it's

198
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,800
a great question and one that we're

199
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:02,240
still trying to answer as it is um this

200
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,639
takes some time

201
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,240
um it may be

202
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,800
we did

203
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,038
different sessions one was just with an

204
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,800
hour of dry ice exposure

205
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:17,360
and we did two that way and two uh with

206
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,560
48 hours of exposure now that's probably

207
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,639
overkill

208
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,839
it may be that a happy medium is

209
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:26,639
somewhere a few hours of exposure

210
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:29,198
um this does take some time

211
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:32,080
um there could be a marked cost savings

212
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:35,360
however because with this process you're

213
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:38,879
not having to have a drying facility or

214
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,879
take that time to dry uh ostensibly it'd

215
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:42,799
be possible that you'd be from fresh

216
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:45,838
flower to the

217
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:48,319
finished kryokev as we call it

218
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:51,920
um in just a few hours

219
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:54,720
now the yields are not fantastic but

220
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:56,958
depending on the of our involved

221
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,360
we did see yields that were quite

222
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:00,559
comparable to what people get with water

223
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,959
hash

224
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:05,039
now water hash

225
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:07,039
can be a very nice product

226
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:09,838
however there are issues with it because

227
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:12,559
you end up with a bunch of wastewater

228
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,680
and to my knowledge it would not be very

229
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:15,679
easy

230
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:18,239
to um

231
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:19,599
to fix that up and use it for another

232
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,560
purpose

233
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:26,159
and you also end up with um

234
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:29,199
with that process with a bunch of sludgy

235
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:32,079
uh biomass material that again may not

236
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,839
be good for much except composting

237
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,800
with cryokeep it's quite different

238
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:40,560
however what you end up with

239
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:42,479
is flour that has partially been denuded

240
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:45,679
of its trichomes

241
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:48,080
however as we tested all the material

242
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:50,159
each step of the way we know that that

243
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,080
remaining

244
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:54,639
byproduct

245
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:58,160
could also be extracted

246
00:09:54,639 --> 00:10:00,639
by co2 or cold ethanol and so it's not

247
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:02,399
wasted at all which might be the case

248
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:05,759
with water hash

249
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:08,639
so ultimately what we'd end up with is

250
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:10,559
this byproduct that's extractable

251
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:12,078
plus a

252
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:14,719
high quality

253
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:17,039
extract the cryoke which

254
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,399
we believe would be useful in a number

255
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:20,559
of fashions

256
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,958
on the one hand it may be very

257
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:25,919
attractive to the high end

258
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:28,479
uh keef connoisseur market

259
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:31,360
and so it could be a va

260
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,200
you know be sold at a premium

261
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:36,320
additionally for

262
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,959
like pharmaceutical applications this

263
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,920
may be a much better way to go because

264
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:42,000
again

265
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:44,479
what you're ending up with is a much

266
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,839
purer product

267
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:50,399
as you're starting material um

268
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:53,519
you basically have got

269
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:56,799
again upwards of 60 percent

270
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:58,879
uh cannabinoids and hopefully

271
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:59,919
uh depending on the source material

272
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:01,838
somewhere

273
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:04,799
six or seven percent

274
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:06,480
terpenoids and there probably is some

275
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:08,799
water left there

276
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,879
but you're not ending up with hundreds

277
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:11,759
of extraneous chemicals that really

278
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:14,240
aren't

279
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:15,439
uh contributing to the therapeutic

280
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,639
effect

281
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,560
um so we we think this will be viable

282
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:21,679
but you know it will be a specialty

283
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:23,599
product

284
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:25,120
um

285
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,639
we haven't quite worked at all the

286
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:30,480
economics but we think it's uh could be

287
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:33,600
a very good thing

288
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:36,720
depending on the application

289
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,480
can you touch a little bit on the

290
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,879
entourage effect

291
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,480
and uh its therapeutic benefits in

292
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:44,078
regards to

293
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,759
terpenes um

294
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:47,120
and how they may be like medically

295
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:48,000
beneficial

296
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,799
sure

297
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,440
okay so the entourage effect uh this

298
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:55,759
term was coined in 1998 by professors

299
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,959
muslim and ben shabbat in israel now

300
00:11:55,759 --> 00:12:00,799
originally they applied this to

301
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:04,319
endocannabinoids it was the idea that we

302
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:07,359
have two main endogenous cannabinoids

303
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:10,320
anandamide and two arachidona glycerol

304
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:14,399
and what they noted experimentally was

305
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:17,680
that related molecules the entourage

306
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:20,000
that seemingly were inactive or very had

307
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:21,359
very poor activity on their own when

308
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,879
combined

309
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,399
with the main players on ananda mind and

310
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:28,320
through ag

311
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,480
there was a remarkably markedly

312
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,959
synergistic effect

313
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,639
say on treating inflammation

314
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:36,399
the next year they published another

315
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:39,759
article where they said well you know

316
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:43,519
this could apply to the plant as well

317
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:45,759
um and you know this keys into a concept

318
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,919
that's been present in botanical

319
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:50,799
medicine forever that

320
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:53,120
um you know there usually isn't one

321
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:54,799
active component

322
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:58,078
or

323
00:12:54,799 --> 00:13:01,120
a key ingredient but rather a collection

324
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:03,759
of chemicals that work in concert

325
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,639
to produce the desired effect

326
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:06,639
and

327
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:10,959
you know that's sort of analogous as

328
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:14,000
well to traditional chinese medicine tcm

329
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:16,239
where it's usually not a simple meaning

330
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,958
one earth but rather a combination of

331
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:22,000
verbs and so you might have two or three

332
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:24,159
that are aiming at the pain

333
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,039
but you've got additional ones that

334
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:29,199
improve the taste or reduce the side

335
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:32,480
effect from the first three

336
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,959
well cannabis is like tcm or an

337
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,800
entourage unto itself

338
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:39,958
we know that

339
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:42,799
there are upwards of 150 different

340
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:47,039
phytocannabinoids that the plant makes

341
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:49,919
now beyond the familiar thc and cbd

342
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:52,719
um there are probably

343
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:55,599
10 others where we know a fair amount

344
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:58,000
about the pharmacology and each of these

345
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,839
has unique therapeutic properties that

346
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,320
are distinct from thc and

347
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:07,120
cbd beyond that you have the aromatic

348
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,440
components of cannabis the turbinoids

349
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:12,240
and there have been 200 different ones

350
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:15,279
that have been described in cannabis

351
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:18,399
none so far unique to cannabis but

352
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:21,039
they're common to other plants

353
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:23,039
just to give a few examples

354
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:25,919
limonene is going to be familiar to

355
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:28,319
anyone who smelled citrus

356
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:31,759
so limonene is at the base of the

357
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:35,040
essential oils from all the citrus

358
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:36,799
whether it be orange lemon lime kumquats

359
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:37,838
even

360
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:40,879
and

361
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:44,000
limonene is a well-tested

362
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:47,120
molecule and it has been shown in humans

363
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:50,958
to have marked antidepressant effects

364
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:53,839
um and we've recently done experiments

365
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:56,479
at johns hopkins with ryan vondre

366
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:58,320
showing that limonene in conjunction

367
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:02,320
with thc

368
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:05,760
makes a significant decrease in the um

369
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:08,800
anxiety levels that thc can produce

370
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:12,720
so that's one example it's also limonene

371
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:16,399
is also an immune stimulating compound

372
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,199
uh mercene mercinese the most common

373
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,919
uh

374
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:23,198
terpene that we find in cannabis in

375
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:24,319
conjunction with thc is very uh soap

376
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:27,599
horrific

377
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:30,240
uh produces fatigue and it's what i like

378
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,040
to call the couch lock compound

379
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,320
um

380
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:37,039
so it really can be helpful for sleep in

381
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,160
particular but has anti-inflammatory

382
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:39,599
properties

383
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:41,039
as well

384
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,639
linalool

385
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:46,799
is common to cannabis and to lavender

386
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,159
again even in humans

387
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:50,639
linoleul

388
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:53,919
or lavender essential oil has been shown

389
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:56,480
to be a very effective anti-anxiety

390
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:59,759
agent this has been demonstrated

391
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:02,320
clinically in demented patients patients

392
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:05,600
with alzheimer's disease that can get

393
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:08,079
quite agitated particularly at night

394
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:11,040
so improvements in sleep decreases in

395
00:16:08,078 --> 00:16:13,519
nursing care have been demonstrated

396
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:15,278
and these things all are boosted

397
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:18,480
um by

398
00:16:15,278 --> 00:16:21,278
their association with thc

399
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,039
cbd or others

400
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:24,519
another example and this is an

401
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:28,240
interesting one

402
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:30,560
caryophyllene um occurs in cannabis

403
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:33,680
um it has the distinction of being not

404
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:35,518
just a terpene but a cannabinoid as well

405
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:37,758
because it works on something called the

406
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:42,159
cb2 receptor

407
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:44,759
cb2 is a non-intoxicating receptor

408
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:46,958
that has pain relieving and

409
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:49,680
anti-inflammatory effects

410
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:51,838
so having caryophyllene along with thc

411
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:54,799
and other components can make it a

412
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:57,199
better drug for pain or inflammation

413
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:58,879
uh it also has an anti-addictive

414
00:16:57,198 --> 00:17:01,519
property

415
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:03,600
and all this is work that's been amply

416
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:06,000
demonstrated in basic science

417
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,759
experiments

418
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,640
so

419
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:12,400
those are just a few of the examples now

420
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:16,640
you will hear from people that the

421
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:19,120
entourage effect isn't proven well

422
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:23,038
there are plenty of examples uh whether

423
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:25,438
they be now in humans or in animal work

424
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:27,679
or in laboratory work uh that

425
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,919
demonstrate that uh

426
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:33,120
there is this entourage effect there is

427
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:35,440
synergy of these ingredients so it's a

428
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:38,000
bold statement um you know they're

429
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,798
trying to prove the negative by saying

430
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,160
that the entourage effect isn't proven i

431
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:43,918
just wonder

432
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,320
how much evidence is going to be

433
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:48,000
sufficient for the doubters to come on

434
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:51,119
board

435
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,319
i mean also anybody has to do is try

436
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:55,359
marinol

437
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:57,519
synthetic thc and compare that to what

438
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:59,199
herbal cannabis is like

439
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:01,200
and it will be

440
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:04,240
very self-evident

441
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,720
that these are two different

442
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,558
types of effects different animals if

443
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,759
you you will

444
00:18:08,558 --> 00:18:13,759
thc on its own is not a pleasant

445
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:16,160
experience

446
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:19,200
it's more apt to produce dysphoria

447
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:21,440
unhappiness than euphoria and it's quite

448
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:25,200
disorienting even to people who are

449
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,320
accustomed to use of cannabis

450
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,960
whereas

451
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:30,798
with these other components they tend to

452
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,200
tame thc

453
00:18:30,798 --> 00:18:34,319
and increase its therapeutic index

454
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,440
meaning

455
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:38,798
increasing the the allowable dose

456
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,880
um that can

457
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:43,670
exert the therapeutic effects without

458
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:46,000
producing side effects

459
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:49,440
[Music]

460
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,919
yeah there's there's a lot there um

461
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:55,200
one one thing i thought of is the work

462
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:58,320
of dr eddie ray and the cannabis cup in

463
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:00,720
oregon that jeremy's also a part of

464
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:02,000
where they found that the sensory

465
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,759
experience

466
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,960
by the judges

467
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:07,119
was

468
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,360
not necessarily

469
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:11,279
like the highest thc cultivars were not

470
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:15,199
the consistent winners so

471
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:16,798
consumers even though were driven by uh

472
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,279
thc

473
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:21,679
from a marketing perspective

474
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:22,720
from a consumer experience sensory

475
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,519
experience

476
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,600
the the high thc cultivars are not the

477
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:29,200
ones that are winning so

478
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:30,000
it fits with what you're saying about

479
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,960
this

480
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,798
therapeutic experience having

481
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,840
all these other components to the plant

482
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:37,599
um

483
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:39,599
along those lines

484
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:41,599
as from a cultivation perspective one of

485
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:43,759
the questions that was given to me by

486
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:46,000
from a cultivator was

487
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:48,480
are there issues with unsafe levels in

488
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,759
the case of making extracts in relation

489
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,519
to

490
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:53,519
these terpenes

491
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:56,000
any potential long-term issues for

492
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:57,679
workers that are being exposed

493
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,079
on a daily basis is that something to be

494
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:03,038
concerned about um yeah it's a good

495
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:05,279
question in general

496
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:07,919
what we usually see with concentrates is

497
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:09,279
a loss of the turbinoids

498
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,400
so i've already as i've already

499
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:13,440
mentioned

500
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:15,840
in the drying and curing process

501
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:18,558
you're losing up to half of the lower

502
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:19,439
molecular weight monoterpenoids to begin

503
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:24,079
with

504
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:27,200
then that's compounded oftentimes by

505
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:28,720
the tendency to do supercritical co2

506
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,960
extraction

507
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:33,120
um in one pass

508
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:36,240
now that's really efficient at getting

509
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:37,599
the cannabinoids out but also waste the

510
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,480
turbinoids

511
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:40,480
um

512
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,279
you know it would be better to do two

513
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:46,400
passes one aimed at the turbinoid

514
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:49,599
extraction and a separate one

515
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:51,759
for the cannabinoids um but going back

516
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:55,439
to the question can you have too much

517
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:58,000
terpenoid yeah the the answer is yes

518
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:01,200
let's use the example of pinene now

519
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,720
pinene is a very important agent

520
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:06,159
it actually

521
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:08,880
can reverse or eliminate the short-term

522
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:11,679
memory impairment from thc

523
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,840
but it is a little bit irritating if the

524
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:16,880
concentration were too high it's going

525
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:20,798
to be irritating to the lungs and cause

526
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:22,799
cough um if it were inhaled

527
00:21:20,798 --> 00:21:23,918
so that's a possibility

528
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:26,558
but

529
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:29,360
you know a rule of thumb i like to use

530
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:31,519
is follow what nature does

531
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:32,719
so let's just say for the sake of

532
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:35,679
discussion

533
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,839
we've got a cannabis flower that tests

534
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:42,080
out at 25

535
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:44,439
on uh thc or total cannabinoid content

536
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:48,000
what would be a reasonable

537
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:49,519
corresponding content of turbinoids

538
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,038
well um

539
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:52,079
you know there

540
00:21:51,038 --> 00:21:54,079
um

541
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:56,558
we usually see something

542
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:58,798
five percent a big great one

543
00:21:56,558 --> 00:21:59,918
um so maybe 20

544
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:02,158
of the

545
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:04,480
uh cannabinoid content

546
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:06,880
uh would be a good figure for the

547
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:10,000
turbinoid content usually it's much

548
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,960
lower than that as i'm sure you're aware

549
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,839
um

550
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:16,000
but um the key thing would be

551
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:17,199
does it produce irritation if it's

552
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
inhaled

553
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,798
um

554
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,640
there

555
00:22:18,798 --> 00:22:24,240
are toxicities

556
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:26,720
um to the the uh terpenoids found in

557
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:29,519
cannabis but usually at very high

558
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,440
concentrations or high doses

559
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:35,038
for the most part

560
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:36,798
these are agents that are in our diets

561
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:38,839
uh they're often used as food

562
00:22:36,798 --> 00:22:41,519
supplements and are

563
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:43,519
erected their grass

564
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:46,960
that doesn't mean the stuff in the lawn

565
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:50,480
it means generally recognized as safe as

566
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:51,519
food additives or flavoring agents

567
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,720
um

568
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:56,720
so yeah i mean they're rare rare uh

569
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,759
terpenoids um

570
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,200
uh pulagone for example

571
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:03,519
um

572
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,720
i haven't seen it in cannabis in many

573
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:07,519
years

574
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:09,440
uh but there have been

575
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:12,158
reports that it could produce

576
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:14,240
miscarriages on at least in animal

577
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:16,240
testing

578
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,400
it's also found in penny royal which

579
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,880
isn't recommended for pregnant women for

580
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:23,440
example

581
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,039
but in general these are very safe

582
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:28,558
compounds of

583
00:23:25,038 --> 00:23:30,400
used in a reasonable concentration

584
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:32,558
that's good to hear um and i'm sure

585
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:37,759
folks can take proper

586
00:23:32,558 --> 00:23:39,440
uh where ppe is appropriate if needed

587
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:41,599
getting on to another question though i

588
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,360
want to jump back you had mentioned one

589
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:44,558
of the reasons that you did this most

590
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:47,439
recent

591
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:48,879
extraction study or sorry a drawing

592
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,679
study with

593
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:55,039
jeremy was because of his facility and

594
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:56,240
the fact that he uses organic production

595
00:23:55,038 --> 00:23:58,400
can you

596
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,319
explain a little more on why you feel

597
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,840
organic production is important from a

598
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:05,678
medical perspective or a therapeutic

599
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:06,798
perspective well first is a safety

600
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:09,278
factor

601
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:11,200
um inorganic culture

602
00:24:09,278 --> 00:24:13,440
it's a given that you're not going to

603
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,880
use pesticides

604
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,960
and

605
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,200
these are things that

606
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:22,960
just shouldn't be

607
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:25,519
in cannabis that consumers are utilizing

608
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:27,360
particularly if it's in healed because

609
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:28,480
in the same way

610
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:30,158
that

611
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,880
inhaling

612
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:35,120
cannabis smoke or vapor

613
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:38,000
gets into the system very quickly the

614
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:41,519
same is going to be true for pesticides

615
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,440
and in general if something kills a bug

616
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:45,839
there's a fair chance that it's got

617
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:48,159
toxicity for humans as well

618
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:50,720
now there are exceptions

619
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:53,679
there are certain pesticides that target

620
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:56,480
receptors and insects that humans don't

621
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:58,000
have but

622
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:01,599
in general

623
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:04,000
most pesticides are bad for you um so

624
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:07,439
there's that whole element

625
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,720
um i think that part's pretty obvious or

626
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:12,000
logical

627
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:15,120
but beyond that um i can just say i've

628
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,359
been an organic farmer myself for

629
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:20,000
geez

630
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:21,918
at least 40 years

631
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,200
it's important to me

632
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:25,520
to know

633
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,880
what i'm putting into my body

634
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:29,359
and i hope the same would be

635
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:32,400
particularly true for people that are

636
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:32,399
taking medicine

637
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:37,600
so there's again um beyond the safety

638
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,759
factor

639
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:41,359
i am quite

640
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:42,640
convinced

641
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:46,000
that

642
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:48,640
growing plants organically is going to

643
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,119
provide a healthier plant

644
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:54,799
and a healthier product

645
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:58,158
by healthier product i mean that

646
00:25:54,798 --> 00:26:00,558
a happy plant is going to likely produce

647
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:03,520
better medicine and that could be in the

648
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:06,879
form of higher yields of cannabinoids

649
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:07,679
and terpenoids or better balance

650
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,039
um

651
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,400
you know

652
00:26:09,038 --> 00:26:13,119
we have to go back

653
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:16,320
a step and ask why does the plant make

654
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:18,000
these things well it wasn't put on god's

655
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:19,678
green earth

656
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,798
to get us high

657
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:24,559
how we know that is the human species is

658
00:26:22,798 --> 00:26:27,839
under a million years old and the

659
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:31,278
cannabis plant is 30 million years old

660
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:34,798
well then you should ask the question

661
00:26:31,278 --> 00:26:37,359
why are cannabinoids in the plant

662
00:26:34,798 --> 00:26:39,200
the endocannabinoid system is actually

663
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:40,639
much older than that

664
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:44,558
it's um

665
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:45,759
300 million years old um

666
00:26:44,558 --> 00:26:49,200
so

667
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:53,278
the plant happens to make these things

668
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:55,519
and it does so for ecological reasons

669
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:58,000
so making these chemicals whether they

670
00:26:55,519 --> 00:26:59,759
be cannabinoids or turbinoids serves the

671
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,720
purpose of the plant

672
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:05,359
in this instance it is to

673
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,400
have antibiotic effects anti-fungal

674
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:09,599
effects

675
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:13,679
and to discourage predation

676
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:15,918
now it's a happy accident for us

677
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:18,640
that these chemicals that the plants

678
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:20,799
making for its own purposes happen to be

679
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,399
very salutary

680
00:27:20,798 --> 00:27:25,119
good for our health

681
00:27:22,398 --> 00:27:27,199
or enjoyment as the case may be

682
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:29,839
um but

683
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,840
we also have to recognize that

684
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:33,519
things are not the same today as they've

685
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:36,000
always been

686
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:38,480
what is always been with respect to

687
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,398
human medicine was that

688
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,960
medicine came from plants

689
00:27:40,398 --> 00:27:44,639
and it's only been in about the last 75

690
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,480
to 100 years

691
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:50,080
that we've had the capability of

692
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:51,519
synthetic chemistry to make drugs from

693
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:53,119
scratch that

694
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:55,519
in some instances

695
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:57,278
don't exist in nature

696
00:27:55,519 --> 00:28:00,798
now that can be a good thing or a bad

697
00:27:57,278 --> 00:28:03,200
thing um i really

698
00:28:00,798 --> 00:28:06,079
am well aware of the bad things in terms

699
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,960
of the toxicities whereas

700
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:08,960
um

701
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,038
medicine from a plant

702
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:14,240
often not always

703
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:17,599
but often it's going to be safer and

704
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:20,399
easier for the system to incorporate or

705
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:21,599
detoxify as the case may be

706
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:23,439
um

707
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:25,678
so there's that

708
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,679
um

709
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,720
i'll stop there for a second

710
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:32,960
yeah the one the one thing i wanted to

711
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,798
get back to was the the pesticide

712
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:37,200
comment we do

713
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:39,440
in organic production there are some

714
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,720
pesticides that i still wouldn't want

715
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,200
folks to use even though they would

716
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:46,319
qualify as organic like urethrins for

717
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:48,399
example yeah you know i i happen to know

718
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:50,158
how you know sam over at proof and

719
00:28:48,398 --> 00:28:51,839
jeremy are running their facility and i

720
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:56,080
feel quite confident in the quality of

721
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:58,079
their flower but it's a definite concern

722
00:28:56,079 --> 00:29:00,158
one other aspect from the cultivation

723
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:03,278
perspective that you and i touched on

724
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:04,320
before the podcast was this um

725
00:29:03,278 --> 00:29:07,359
sort of the

726
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:10,558
the microbial uh relationship in the

727
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:12,879
rhizosphere between plant root exudates

728
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:13,839
and you know the microbiology that

729
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,440
exists

730
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:16,959
and how those work together in a

731
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,278
symbiotic way

732
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,880
to really allow the plant to control its

733
00:29:19,278 --> 00:29:22,640
growth

734
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,559
you had an interesting analogy there if

735
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,399
you want to share it

736
00:29:24,558 --> 00:29:27,599
in relation to humans

737
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:28,798
um

738
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:33,278
if you want to

739
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:35,599
mention that yeah sure i mean um

740
00:29:33,278 --> 00:29:37,359
we are humans but we're complex

741
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:40,480
organisms as well

742
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:44,079
we have a whole gut microbiome that

743
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:46,880
consists of trillions of bacteria

744
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:49,678
without these we would be in serious

745
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:51,520
trouble because they are responsible for

746
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:54,159
eating digestion

747
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:56,879
reducing inflammation and

748
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:59,600
often producing chemicals that we

749
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:02,960
couldn't get from our food

750
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:04,798
without them plants are the same

751
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,759
plants have roots

752
00:30:04,798 --> 00:30:07,839
they're

753
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:09,519
going through the substrate hopefully

754
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:12,558
soil

755
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:15,278
and seeking nutrients

756
00:30:12,558 --> 00:30:17,440
now they can manage this

757
00:30:15,278 --> 00:30:19,119
in a sterile soil

758
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:22,480
however

759
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:23,359
they incorporate these nutrients a lot

760
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,079
better

761
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:28,000
if there is also the presence of

762
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:29,319
appropriate

763
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,480
other

764
00:30:29,319 --> 00:30:36,079
microbiota usually fungi in this

765
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:39,038
instance but also bacteria

766
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:40,879
there's a symbiosis there that

767
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:44,720
they nourish the

768
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:47,760
fungi or bacteria and in return

769
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:49,759
get help in incorporating the nutrients

770
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:53,440
that they need

771
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:56,240
in a proper ecology of a cannabis plant

772
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:58,960
or tree or anything else is going to

773
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:01,679
include the plant itself plus these

774
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,960
other agents

775
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:05,519
and

776
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:08,399
when those agents are present

777
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:10,159
plant finds it a lot easier to draw

778
00:31:08,398 --> 00:31:11,918
what it needs

779
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:14,799
um and so you're going to have a

780
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:16,240
healthier plant you know when a plant is

781
00:31:14,798 --> 00:31:18,480
really healthy

782
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,558
maybe you don't have the need for any of

783
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:23,519
these pesticides

784
00:31:20,558 --> 00:31:25,278
or even organic controls

785
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:26,960
um but

786
00:31:25,278 --> 00:31:29,278
we make it tough

787
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,240
for cannabis in a lot of instances

788
00:31:29,278 --> 00:31:31,519
because

789
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,759
um

790
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:34,960
they're in crowded conditions

791
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:37,440
um they

792
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,720
usually isn't a lot of thought given to

793
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,840
providing

794
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:43,038
uh

795
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:45,278
these mycorrhizal agents that are going

796
00:31:43,038 --> 00:31:49,119
to help the plant be healthy and so

797
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:51,919
you've got to use all these artificial

798
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:53,599
agents to try and control diseases after

799
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:54,480
the fact

800
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:55,839
so

801
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:59,919
i mean it's

802
00:31:55,839 --> 00:32:02,158
having proper nutrition of your plant um

803
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:05,278
more naturally it's sort of like

804
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:05,278
preventive medicine

805
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,558
makes sense i mean one could survive on

806
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:12,079
mcdonald's and steroids

807
00:32:10,558 --> 00:32:15,119
but you certainly wouldn't be as healthy

808
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:17,519
as someone who's eating a balanced diet

809
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:19,359
and you'd be more likely to get illness

810
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:22,159
be more susceptible to

811
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:24,079
a variety problems um

812
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:25,919
so that makes sense

813
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:28,798
one one other thing that i thought of

814
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:31,360
when we were talking about uh proof is

815
00:32:28,798 --> 00:32:33,918
and jeremy was this uh

816
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:35,759
goal he has of getting replicable

817
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:38,480
chemovar expression

818
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:40,319
so that uh from from a patient

819
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:43,200
perspective

820
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:47,038
he can get a consistent response

821
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:49,759
every time you consume um a particular

822
00:32:47,038 --> 00:32:50,879
you know cultivar a particular product

823
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:52,879
how

824
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,320
because the big argument i've heard for

825
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:57,200
moving towards

826
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:59,839
you know more chemicals um

827
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:02,558
more synthetic more synthesized um

828
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:05,038
versions of thc is that we can get

829
00:33:02,558 --> 00:33:07,519
consistent you know pharmaceutical

830
00:33:05,038 --> 00:33:09,038
uh responses or quality

831
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:12,319
how do we do this

832
00:33:09,038 --> 00:33:15,119
from a cultivation perspective or as an

833
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:16,720
organic grower

834
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:18,239
yeah and how does that benefit the

835
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:21,839
patient

836
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:25,200
first and foremost i need to say that it

837
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:28,398
not only should be done it has been done

838
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:31,200
and one reason i wanted to do this that

839
00:33:28,398 --> 00:33:34,079
the experiment of proof was

840
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:36,880
so that we could highlight jeremy's work

841
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:40,319
in showing that indoor organic

842
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:42,880
regenerative culture of cannabis

843
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:45,519
was practical

844
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:47,519
and beyond that

845
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:49,679
this is using the ultimate controlled

846
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:51,278
environment now

847
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:52,798
it would be great

848
00:33:51,278 --> 00:33:56,319
if we could

849
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:59,359
plant on outdoors under the sun

850
00:33:56,319 --> 00:34:00,398
and get reproducible crops however

851
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:03,119
um

852
00:34:00,398 --> 00:34:05,599
in the pacific northwest these days we

853
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:07,439
have wildfires

854
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:10,480
late in the summer there's smoke

855
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:12,000
exposure there's dust in the air there's

856
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,719
straight pollen

857
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,280
there is pesticide contamination from

858
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:19,118
your neighbor drifting over

859
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,879
it's not controlled

860
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:23,440
um and

861
00:34:20,878 --> 00:34:25,838
this is unfortunate but it's the truth

862
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:28,639
and it's a hard thing to avoid or one

863
00:34:25,838 --> 00:34:29,838
hail storm can wipe out your crop

864
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:31,919
um

865
00:34:29,838 --> 00:34:34,799
let's concentrate for a second on the

866
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:37,199
pharmaceutical market to make a

867
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:40,159
pharmaceutical from a plant

868
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:42,158
this has been done it can be done again

869
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:45,599
it's got to be controlled every step of

870
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:47,599
the way to get the kind of consistency

871
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:49,440
that the food and drug administration

872
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:52,000
requires of a drug

873
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:54,079
that there's very little variance

874
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,800
in the components from one batch to

875
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:59,119
another this is a scenic unknown if you

876
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:01,119
don't have that you don't get approved

877
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:03,760
and you have to maintain that throughout

878
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:07,039
the life of the drug

879
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:08,960
but this can be done it requires that

880
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:11,838
you have

881
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:13,440
consistent genetics but also consistent

882
00:35:11,838 --> 00:35:14,320
environment

883
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,960
so this

884
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:18,240
is best done in a greenhouse or totally

885
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:22,000
indoors

886
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:24,879
um and in the case of indoors um

887
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:28,559
using led lighting it's possible to

888
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:30,800
affect the spectrum that in turn affects

889
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:32,400
the expression of these chemical

890
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,280
components

891
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,720
so

892
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:37,119
you know it is the ultimate and

893
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:39,519
scientific culture

894
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:41,760
for medical applications

895
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:41,759
um

896
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:46,559
so

897
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,200
with that though there's all these

898
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:53,199
variables that the plant is exposed to

899
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:54,559
from how healthy is your mother plant um

900
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:56,838
you know and in theory you're starting

901
00:35:54,559 --> 00:36:00,960
from clones so let's say we take the

902
00:35:56,838 --> 00:36:03,199
same the same clone all the way through

903
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:05,119
round after round

904
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:06,719
you know we'll see variances in

905
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:08,000
irrigation

906
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:10,399
pest pressure

907
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,960
all these things nutrients

908
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:15,680
will all have impact on chemovar

909
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:17,280
expression as you know so i guess what

910
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:19,598
i'm wondering is is it

911
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:22,640
you say it's possible how do we get that

912
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:26,160
level of consistency to a point where

913
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:28,960
maybe the fda would accept um would

914
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:29,759
accept something as

915
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,679
you know

916
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:34,079
as medically consistent

917
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:37,118
well it's already happened it happened

918
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:40,480
with epi dialects which is a purified

919
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:43,358
cbd derived from plant it also happened

920
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:46,480
with sativex sativex is

921
00:36:43,358 --> 00:36:49,759
uh extracts of a high thc plant in a

922
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:51,519
high cbd plant with other com

923
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,800
components other cannabinoids and

924
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:55,039
terpenoids

925
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,119
although it was not approved clinically

926
00:36:55,039 --> 00:37:00,239
by the fda it did make it through the

927
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:03,599
chemistry manufacturing control

928
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:06,559
uh process at fda what that means is

929
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:08,720
the consistency was demonstrated despite

930
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:10,400
the fact that there were hundreds of

931
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:13,838
components

932
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:15,760
so i mean i could show you a slide of

933
00:37:13,838 --> 00:37:19,440
25

934
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:20,560
different batches of sativex over nine

935
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,679
years

936
00:37:20,559 --> 00:37:24,239
and

937
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:28,319
the traces superimposed look like single

938
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:29,199
peaks you can't see much variance at all

939
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,720
um

940
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:33,358
now

941
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:35,039
for example in europe

942
00:37:33,358 --> 00:37:37,440
when you're making a medicine from a

943
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:39,838
plant they usually have allowed a

944
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:42,320
variation plus or minus on a particular

945
00:37:39,838 --> 00:37:43,440
component of 10

946
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:46,320
medically

947
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:48,960
it's got to be better than that um

948
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:52,240
accepted figure now is about 5

949
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:54,639
but um with the fda i'm sure that the

950
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:55,759
variance was much much less than five

951
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:58,480
percent

952
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:01,599
um and again this can be done

953
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:04,400
if you have um consistent genetics

954
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:07,838
uh you have an uh

955
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:10,320
stipulated process every step of the way

956
00:38:07,838 --> 00:38:13,039
um you know i can tell you at gw it was

957
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:15,680
77 days from when the rooted cuttings

958
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:19,279
went out until they were harvested not

959
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:20,239
76 not 78.

960
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,640
they

961
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:24,399
didn't use pesticides at all

962
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:26,400
when there were bugs

963
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:29,358
thrips and what have you they were dealt

964
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:32,079
with through integrated pest management

965
00:38:29,358 --> 00:38:34,799
good bugs eat bad bugs

966
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:37,280
and this is all acceptable so this has

967
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:39,920
already happened it can happen again

968
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,760
that's not to say that it's easy or that

969
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,119
it's cheap

970
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,680
but

971
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:48,079
again in the pharmaceutical market

972
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:51,199
you're always paying a high price

973
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:55,359
for what we hope will be an effective

974
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:57,519
safe and consistent agent

975
00:38:55,358 --> 00:38:59,440
okay i mean that makes

976
00:38:57,519 --> 00:39:00,559
that makes sense

977
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,159
um

978
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:04,159
do you see this always being an

979
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:07,118
extracted product then or do you think

980
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:09,759
flower could get to a level to where

981
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:12,640
we could get that kind of consistency

982
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:14,560
sure well ted you know

983
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:16,480
whether people like it or not they're

984
00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:19,199
always going to be three echelons of

985
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,320
activity with cannabis based

986
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:23,439
products

987
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:24,400
uh herbal cannabis isn't going away

988
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:27,599
um

989
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,800
the second echelon is supplements that

990
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:31,039
hopefully

991
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:34,720
have some degree of standardization and

992
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:35,679
quality control and then the top tier if

993
00:39:34,719 --> 00:39:38,480
you will

994
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:40,239
is pharmaceutical production which again

995
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,800
has to

996
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:45,439
surpass a higher bar in terms of all

997
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:47,119
these um stipulations

998
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,159
um but these are always going to be

999
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:48,960
around

1000
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:51,358
um

1001
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:53,358
you know but i i can tell you the u.s

1002
00:39:51,358 --> 00:39:55,119
federal government made a mistake in

1003
00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:56,799
1985

1004
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:58,720
when they um

1005
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:02,160
the fda

1006
00:39:58,719 --> 00:40:04,000
approved synthetic thc as marinol and

1007
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:04,799
thought that was going to take care of

1008
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,679
the

1009
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:11,440
whole issue of cannabis on herbal

1010
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:13,358
cannabis as medicine that didn't happen

1011
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,800
and it won't happen

1012
00:40:13,358 --> 00:40:16,480
um

1013
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:20,079
right

1014
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:22,240
so we need this we need this plant um

1015
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:24,920
essentially what you're saying i know

1016
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:26,479
it's glory and all its different uh

1017
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:28,159
manifestations

1018
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,358
i i want to touch on that with you

1019
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:30,399
because

1020
00:40:29,358 --> 00:40:32,960
uh

1021
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,880
you know genetic diversity in cannabis

1022
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,960
is is massive

1023
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:38,720
we're learning more and more it seems

1024
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:41,599
like every day

1025
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:44,879
as to not just its effects but what

1026
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:44,880
what its potential is

1027
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:48,639
how important is

1028
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,559
the genetic diversity we currently have

1029
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:54,000
in terms of preservation and what are

1030
00:40:50,559 --> 00:40:57,119
you most excited about um

1031
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,800
seeing coming out of the cannabis plant

1032
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:01,358
well uh

1033
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:03,839
and that we know a lot about cannabis

1034
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:06,480
however we've only scratched the surface

1035
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:08,239
of what it can do therapeutically as i

1036
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:13,199
previously mentioned

1037
00:41:08,239 --> 00:41:15,838
if there are 150 known phytocannabinoids

1038
00:41:13,199 --> 00:41:18,318
people mostly these days only have

1039
00:41:15,838 --> 00:41:21,679
access to about three in any

1040
00:41:18,318 --> 00:41:24,480
concentration thc and cbd

1041
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:26,000
uh last year our team did the first

1042
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:28,480
human study

1043
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,199
of cannabidirl and it's turning out to

1044
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:35,079
be a fabulous agent

1045
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:38,159
and the same can happen for thcv and

1046
00:41:35,079 --> 00:41:40,800
cannabidivarin and a bunch of others we

1047
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:42,480
could reel off the names of over the

1048
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,680
next half an hour

1049
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,358
but um

1050
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:46,960
you know there's there's plenty more to

1051
00:41:45,358 --> 00:41:49,838
come

1052
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:53,280
yeah we really want to show the validity

1053
00:41:49,838 --> 00:41:54,960
of the entourage effect um and i'll make

1054
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:58,000
a bold statement

1055
00:41:54,960 --> 00:42:00,240
there are plenty of uh clinical studies

1056
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,440
that have been done with cannabis in one

1057
00:42:00,239 --> 00:42:06,000
form or another however most of them

1058
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:08,240
have been with very substandard material

1059
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,480
particularly nida cannabis

1060
00:42:08,239 --> 00:42:13,679
that really creates a false impression

1061
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,679
of what the plant can do

1062
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:19,679
i would make this statement that i don't

1063
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:21,920
think any studies so far have been

1064
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:24,159
undertaken with what i would call an

1065
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:27,680
optimized preparation

1066
00:42:24,159 --> 00:42:31,440
um meaning being all it could be

1067
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:34,000
getting the right balance of therapeutic

1068
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,440
components cannabinoids and terpenoids

1069
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,639
to do the job

1070
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:41,159
uh the best way it can be done

1071
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:42,960
so a big part of what we're doing now at

1072
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:44,799
cretoscience is

1073
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,639
trying to formulate

1074
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:48,960
for what we think are going to be better

1075
00:42:46,639 --> 00:42:50,239
preparations

1076
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:53,679
can you talk a little bit about your

1077
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:54,879
company credo science

1078
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:56,000
sure

1079
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:58,480
well

1080
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,280
ken i've been at this for 26 years now

1081
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:01,679
and

1082
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:03,760
uh working for other people and that has

1083
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:04,879
its pros and cons but

1084
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:08,160
um

1085
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:10,480
you know basically at the ripe age of 68

1086
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:12,719
i decided that like it or not i had to

1087
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:14,880
do this myself

1088
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:17,519
so nisha whiteley and i

1089
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:19,599
started credo science right at the start

1090
00:43:17,519 --> 00:43:22,079
of the pandemic

1091
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:24,800
that set us back a while but the idea

1092
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:27,119
was to develop

1093
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:29,200
some concepts that i've been

1094
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:32,720
rattling around in my head

1095
00:43:29,199 --> 00:43:35,279
um different uh approaches to cannabis

1096
00:43:32,719 --> 00:43:37,838
and the endocannabinoid system

1097
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:40,400
uh so you know we've discussed one of

1098
00:43:37,838 --> 00:43:42,719
these applications already and that is

1099
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:45,599
the kryokev technique

1100
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:47,439
um but we also have

1101
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:50,559
plans for a

1102
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:53,200
cannabis based disinfectant a cannabis

1103
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:57,199
treatment for head lice

1104
00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:59,598
we have our formulation service

1105
00:43:57,199 --> 00:44:00,960
so we're doing lots of different things

1106
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:02,640
we also

1107
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:06,079
developed

1108
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:08,559
a screening test for the genetic

1109
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:11,440
mutations that we observed in

1110
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:15,358
cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome

1111
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:18,079
um so it turns out that this isn't from

1112
00:44:15,358 --> 00:44:20,559
pesticides or neem or

1113
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:22,480
other explanations but people that have

1114
00:44:20,559 --> 00:44:25,279
this seem to have a genetic

1115
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:26,318
susceptibility on it causes them to get

1116
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,680
sick

1117
00:44:26,318 --> 00:44:32,559
when they're

1118
00:44:27,679 --> 00:44:32,559
using too much thc on a chronic basis

1119
00:44:33,039 --> 00:44:37,920
that's interesting because i have heard

1120
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:40,079
the the neem comments in many forums

1121
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:42,639
along with a variety of other

1122
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:44,800
hypothesis so it's good to hear from an

1123
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:47,118
actual doctor that that's not not only

1124
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:49,839
that i'm somebody that uses name on my

1125
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:50,960
fruit and berries

1126
00:44:49,838 --> 00:44:52,719
and

1127
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:55,199
whether it's a good idea or not i've

1128
00:44:52,719 --> 00:44:56,480
eaten stuff i sprayed the same day

1129
00:44:55,199 --> 00:45:00,399
um

1130
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:03,440
it didn't do any harm to me

1131
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:05,680
neem like anything can have toxicity

1132
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:08,159
however the toxicity

1133
00:45:05,679 --> 00:45:10,480
we know to be attached to neem doesn't

1134
00:45:08,159 --> 00:45:11,920
match uh that

1135
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:14,880
uh of

1136
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:17,599
cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome at all

1137
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:20,960
um so people would like a different

1138
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:23,359
explanation and the unfortunate truth is

1139
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:25,599
some people are susceptible to this and

1140
00:45:23,358 --> 00:45:28,000
until we find out otherwise they

1141
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:30,000
shouldn't be using cannabis

1142
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,599
which can be really unfortunate for the

1143
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,599
people involved

1144
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:36,160
because they find it extremely difficult

1145
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:36,160
to stop

1146
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:43,040
you you did a whole podcast with shango

1147
00:45:40,639 --> 00:45:45,759
on the shaping fire podcast on this

1148
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:47,759
topic and right i just want to mention

1149
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:49,359
the folks if you're interested in more

1150
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:51,520
of the medical

1151
00:45:49,358 --> 00:45:53,759
therapy side um

1152
00:45:51,519 --> 00:45:57,280
i i think you've done six podcasts now

1153
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:59,119
with shango over there over the years um

1154
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:01,920
they're wonderful so i highly suggest

1155
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:03,519
people go check those out um

1156
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:06,639
i just want to i want to mention that as

1157
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:06,639
a resource for folks

1158
00:46:07,358 --> 00:46:10,078
yeah

1159
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:11,838
well um

1160
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:14,560
that's really exciting i never would

1161
00:46:11,838 --> 00:46:15,358
have thought of using a cannabis product

1162
00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:17,838
for

1163
00:46:15,358 --> 00:46:20,719
head lice for example

1164
00:46:17,838 --> 00:46:22,880
well it's only a 4 000 your

1165
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:26,078
prescription

1166
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:26,079
this was described

1167
00:46:26,318 --> 00:46:32,639
by the uh ancient sumerians so in what's

1168
00:46:29,838 --> 00:46:34,480
now iraq 4 000 years ago

1169
00:46:32,639 --> 00:46:37,118
um you know and it's a simple

1170
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:38,920
prescription cannabis on lice but the

1171
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:40,480
exact same thing is done

1172
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:44,240
contemporaneously

1173
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:47,119
in pakistan um they use fresh

1174
00:46:44,239 --> 00:46:48,719
cannabis and rub it on the head and i

1175
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:50,079
think we can do this much more

1176
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:52,879
effectively

1177
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:54,960
what we want to do is hone in on

1178
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:57,920
you know which components are

1179
00:46:54,960 --> 00:47:00,480
our most efficacious but we know already

1180
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:03,039
that certain phytocannabinoids and

1181
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:04,559
terpenoids are insecticidal

1182
00:47:03,039 --> 00:47:05,759
um

1183
00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:07,039
so

1184
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:09,280
you know it's a relatively

1185
00:47:07,039 --> 00:47:12,400
straightforward set of experiments to

1186
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:12,400
prove the concept

1187
00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:16,559
well you mentioned neem which made me

1188
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:18,640
think about all the applications we have

1189
00:47:16,559 --> 00:47:21,199
for neem

1190
00:47:18,639 --> 00:47:23,920
historically i mean i've used neem

1191
00:47:21,199 --> 00:47:25,919
shampoo and neem toothpaste

1192
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:28,159
it's used as a fertilizer it's used as a

1193
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:32,400
pesticide and a fungicide

1194
00:47:28,159 --> 00:47:34,318
as uh disinfected in many cases

1195
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:36,079
do you think that one of the main

1196
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:37,039
benefits you're seeing with the head

1197
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:39,200
lice

1198
00:47:37,039 --> 00:47:41,679
is relation to the oils in the in the

1199
00:47:39,199 --> 00:47:43,519
cannabis is more of just a suffocant or

1200
00:47:41,679 --> 00:47:45,039
does it have something like as a direct

1201
00:47:43,519 --> 00:47:46,400
and where it has a chemical component

1202
00:47:45,039 --> 00:47:47,440
that you feel is really

1203
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:49,280
both

1204
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:52,159
um

1205
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:54,720
in my uh slide presentations they show

1206
00:47:52,159 --> 00:47:56,879
an example of what happens when aphids

1207
00:47:54,719 --> 00:47:59,519
are on a cannabis flower

1208
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:01,920
and there are two things one is

1209
00:47:59,519 --> 00:48:03,679
their little legs break the trichomes

1210
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,880
and which then

1211
00:48:03,679 --> 00:48:08,399
burst

1212
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:11,358
uh and polymerize and trap the bug so it

1213
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:13,039
can get killed that way but the uh

1214
00:48:11,358 --> 00:48:14,799
components

1215
00:48:13,039 --> 00:48:17,679
of the trichome cannabinoids and

1216
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:19,200
terpenoids are also insecticidal so it's

1217
00:48:17,679 --> 00:48:21,919
mechanical

1218
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:25,279
uh and chemical

1219
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:25,280
are the mechanisms there

1220
00:48:25,679 --> 00:48:30,719
so if that's the case why do we have

1221
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:33,519
such a proliferation of insect problems

1222
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:35,519
and with flowering cannabis i mean once

1223
00:48:33,519 --> 00:48:38,000
those trichome come in how come you know

1224
00:48:35,519 --> 00:48:41,039
hemp russet or even the cannabis aphid

1225
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,480
are so successful sure well part of its

1226
00:48:41,039 --> 00:48:45,199
monoculture

1227
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:45,199
you know uh

1228
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:52,720
you know often uh in nature uh plant is

1229
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,960
growing with other plants and um it may

1230
00:48:52,719 --> 00:48:57,919
seek out things that help protect a

1231
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:59,838
companion planting if if you will

1232
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,960
but the other thing and i think this is

1233
00:48:59,838 --> 00:49:03,199
important

1234
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:05,280
we have a lot of culture of plants that

1235
00:49:03,199 --> 00:49:07,519
aren't in the right environment so

1236
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:09,119
you've got people that are trying to

1237
00:49:07,519 --> 00:49:12,559
grow um

1238
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:13,760
afghani genetics in a humid

1239
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:15,200
climate

1240
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:17,920
where

1241
00:49:15,199 --> 00:49:18,960
afghanistan's pretty dry

1242
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:21,920
so

1243
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:23,519
some of its male adaption of the

1244
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:26,000
particular

1245
00:49:23,519 --> 00:49:27,838
chemovar genetically to where it's

1246
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:31,440
trying to be grown

1247
00:49:27,838 --> 00:49:33,440
and again nutrition really enters in

1248
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:36,159
i think a lot of these plants that are

1249
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:40,480
subject to insect attack are not getting

1250
00:49:36,159 --> 00:49:41,838
what they need from their substrate um

1251
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:45,280
and uh

1252
00:49:41,838 --> 00:49:47,519
and again if it were

1253
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:50,240
a rich soil

1254
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:53,119
uh with all the necessary bacteria and

1255
00:49:50,239 --> 00:49:56,159
fungi i think it's going to be much less

1256
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:59,838
likely that be subject to the same level

1257
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:59,838
of predation and damage

1258
00:50:00,159 --> 00:50:04,399
yeah i would i would agree with that to

1259
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:05,440
an extent i do think that we see

1260
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:07,358
in

1261
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:09,760
controlled environment agriculture when

1262
00:50:07,358 --> 00:50:12,960
we're indoors too you don't have natural

1263
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:14,880
enemies so we don't have the the natural

1264
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:17,199
bio controls for a lot of these pests so

1265
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:19,760
once one enters a facility

1266
00:50:17,199 --> 00:50:21,919
it's much harder to remove whereas out

1267
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:23,119
in nature you wouldn't have those same

1268
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:24,318
issues

1269
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:26,000
exactly

1270
00:50:24,318 --> 00:50:28,079
right now i have a fruit tree outside

1271
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,119
for example with aphids but yet my

1272
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:31,280
entire

1273
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:32,960
garden is not infested with them they're

1274
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:34,559
primarily on this one plant and they're

1275
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:35,920
not even covering the entire tree

1276
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:37,839
they're just covering a portion of the

1277
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:39,838
tree so um

1278
00:50:37,838 --> 00:50:41,358
there's there's just natural ways

1279
00:50:39,838 --> 00:50:43,119
outdoors that these things are more

1280
00:50:41,358 --> 00:50:44,159
controlled for so they don't necessarily

1281
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:47,200
kill the plant because it's not

1282
00:50:44,159 --> 00:50:49,838
necessarily in the pests interest

1283
00:50:47,199 --> 00:50:51,919
from a survival perspective to to kill a

1284
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:54,400
plant uh it needs something to continue

1285
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:55,280
to eat that that food source so very

1286
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,920
true

1287
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:58,960
i could i could see that being the case

1288
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:00,800
um

1289
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:02,720
wonderful well was there anything else

1290
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:03,839
that you wanted to touch on in regards

1291
00:51:02,719 --> 00:51:05,519
to

1292
00:51:03,838 --> 00:51:07,279
some of the the research you've been

1293
00:51:05,519 --> 00:51:08,960
working on that you'd like to share with

1294
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:11,200
listeners

1295
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:13,679
ah no i think we probably covered it i

1296
00:51:11,199 --> 00:51:18,239
would just like again to make a pitch to

1297
00:51:13,679 --> 00:51:20,960
people for the idea that yes you can do

1298
00:51:18,239 --> 00:51:23,279
uh organic regenerative culture of

1299
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:25,599
cannabis

1300
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:28,160
and even indoors

1301
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:31,039
and i hope that people will

1302
00:51:28,159 --> 00:51:32,719
use your products i mean i i

1303
00:51:31,039 --> 00:51:36,000
spend a lot of time looking at

1304
00:51:32,719 --> 00:51:39,199
ingredients and things i use and i'm

1305
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:41,599
not sure i've ever seen products

1306
00:51:39,199 --> 00:51:43,679
better balanced having the things i'd

1307
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:46,240
like to see

1308
00:51:43,679 --> 00:51:48,480
and i've seen the results in terms of

1309
00:51:46,239 --> 00:51:50,799
what cannabis looks like when

1310
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:51,760
it has this kind of substrate available

1311
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,760
so

1312
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:56,319
uh boy there's no more compelling

1313
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:58,000
evidence than that

1314
00:51:56,318 --> 00:51:58,960
we'll have to get you some soil for your

1315
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,760
garden

1316
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:01,280
um

1317
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:02,319
yeah i didn't

1318
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,119
i

1319
00:52:02,318 --> 00:52:05,679
i

1320
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:07,920
didn't quite do it this season but next

1321
00:52:05,679 --> 00:52:09,039
season i'm i'm looking at uh getting

1322
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:10,079
some

1323
00:52:09,039 --> 00:52:13,279
uh

1324
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:15,359
raised beds put in and uh yeah it's

1325
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:18,160
important to me what goes in

1326
00:52:15,358 --> 00:52:21,199
i might try a little google quilter but

1327
00:52:18,159 --> 00:52:23,279
uh we need to uh wonderful

1328
00:52:21,199 --> 00:52:25,439
otherwise too

1329
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:28,400
yeah we've been working now with uh

1330
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:30,079
jeremy and sam over at proof for um

1331
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:33,440
a year or two

1332
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:34,800
with uh providing them with media with

1333
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:36,480
with soil

1334
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,839
and that's been a really wonderful

1335
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:40,079
experience because of all the data

1336
00:52:37,838 --> 00:52:42,880
collection they do we're really able to

1337
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:44,079
refine and improve our processes because

1338
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:46,400
of the feedback

1339
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:47,519
that we're getting from them um

1340
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:49,440
one thing that some of the other

1341
00:52:47,519 --> 00:52:51,358
facilities that we work with are doing

1342
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:53,920
and i know uh proof is starting to

1343
00:52:51,358 --> 00:52:56,880
experiment with is this idea of reusing

1344
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:58,639
the media too in the facility um which

1345
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:00,160
can lead to some challenges around

1346
00:52:58,639 --> 00:53:02,239
consistency

1347
00:53:00,159 --> 00:53:04,159
as as you know every time you harvest a

1348
00:53:02,239 --> 00:53:05,679
plant you're pulling out organic matter

1349
00:53:04,159 --> 00:53:08,719
you're pulling out nutrients those have

1350
00:53:05,679 --> 00:53:10,000
to be replaced so um replacing them to

1351
00:53:08,719 --> 00:53:12,399
the exact levels that they were at

1352
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,480
before and keeping the biology

1353
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:16,480
you know consistent to what it was to

1354
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:18,800
get that same ex scheme of our

1355
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:20,480
expression is is really challenging but

1356
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:22,800
we do have some facilities that have

1357
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:25,440
been reusing soil now for

1358
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:28,880
oh five to eight years in some cases at

1359
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:30,720
five cycles a year indoors um

1360
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:33,440
quite successfully with good yields so

1361
00:53:30,719 --> 00:53:35,199
