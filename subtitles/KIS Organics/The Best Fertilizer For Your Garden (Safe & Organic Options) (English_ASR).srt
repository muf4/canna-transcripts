1
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:06,960
hey guys Tad here with kiss Organics I

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,559
wanted to share this talk because I get

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,960
a lot of questions about what inputs are

4
00:00:09,558 --> 00:00:14,359
safe to use in your garden and I hear a

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:18,080
lot of talk about this on social media

6
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:19,480
uh online as well as in other groups so

7
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:21,358
this is a talk I put together for the

8
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,640
living soil Summit this year in prump

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:27,080
Nevada and I wanted to re-record it here

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:29,160
to share on YouTube so the question I

11
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:31,639
was looking at is what inputs are safe

12
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,280
to use in your Garden um there's a lot

13
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,000
that goes into what products you choose

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,558
to use to grow your plants with and it's

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,558
important to be thoughtful about those

16
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:45,839
choices so let's start by looking at

17
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:47,840
some common agricultural fertilizers the

18
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,960
industrial meat industry is awful and

19
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:53,160
there's no denying that these animals

20
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:54,399
are fed GMO grains and antibiotics or

21
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:56,558
crops that have been sprayed with

22
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,079
glyphosate which is also Roundup

23
00:00:56,558 --> 00:01:00,640
therefore these fertilizers will be

24
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,878
contaminated with GMOs and antibiotics

25
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,239
and pesticides and you're contaminating

26
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:07,519
your crop when you use these inputs in

27
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:09,520
fact blood meal bone meal and feather

28
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:11,640
meal are not truly organic one could

29
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:13,239
even say they're fake organic because

30
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,680
they come from the waist streams of our

31
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:18,478
industrial meat supply

32
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,840
chain so what are the Alternatives

33
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:22,478
amendments like fishbone meal or fish

34
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,799
meal are much better because they're

35
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:26,959
from the ocean if you have a good source

36
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,159
like wild CAU fish then you're not

37
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:30,839
utilizing uh then you are utilizing

38
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:32,799
cleaner amendments in your garden and

39
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,840
you're not supporting the horrible meat

40
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:38,280
industry and you're doing better by the

41
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:39,960
environment it's an allaround win now

42
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,200
that's a really compelling argument

43
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:44,559
right there it aligns with my values as

44
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,560
someone who cares about Organics and the

45
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,600
environment but what I wanted to do

46
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,320
today is take a deeper look at these

47
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:54,679
claims and see what research exists to

48
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:56,519
either support or refute this idea let's

49
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,640
talk about the conditions under which

50
00:01:56,519 --> 00:02:01,599
animals are raised in the meat industry

51
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,640
to be honest the they're not great this

52
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:07,640
to me is the best argument for not using

53
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,360
these inputs however I also look at it

54
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:13,199
from a sustainability perspective if we

55
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:15,480
know that these fertilizers are safe

56
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:19,119
that they're low and heavy metals that

57
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:21,518
they do not contain GMOs or pesticides

58
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,159
and are very affordable then it makes

59
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:26,840
sense to me to be closing the loop as

60
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:29,039
realistically they're not going anywhere

61
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,560
whether whether these waste products end

62
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:33,959
up in compost fertilizer or even a

63
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,439
landfill and I know many folks in the

64
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:38,080
room are into biomimicry essentially

65
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:40,158
doing what they think Mother Nature

66
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,120
might do and I can't think of anything

67
00:02:40,158 --> 00:02:45,120
more natural or higher use than using a

68
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,800
dead body to recycle the nutrients to

69
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,920
grow something

70
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:53,920
new so what about the fishing industry

71
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:55,518
is it superior to the meat industry well

72
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:58,039
most folks are familiar with the issues

73
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,080
associated with Farm fish farm fish are

74
00:02:58,039 --> 00:03:02,639
raised in high density conditions

75
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,519
similar to the meat industry Farm fish

76
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:06,039
have a higher rate of disease and can be

77
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:08,280
higher in contaminants due to their

78
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:10,719
diets they make up more than half of the

79
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:14,598
fish consumption within the United

80
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:16,158
States between 70 and 80% of the fish of

81
00:03:14,598 --> 00:03:19,439
the seafood consumed in the United

82
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:21,840
States is actually imported but this is

83
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:24,000
a bit of a misleading statistic because

84
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,479
a portion of it is caught by American

85
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,360
fishermen exported overseas for

86
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:30,919
processing and then reimported back into

87
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,640
the US

88
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:35,719
uh and they use open net cages that can

89
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:37,719
leech chemicals into the ocean putting

90
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:39,878
ocean Wildlife at risk and damaging

91
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:41,598
ecosystems and farm fish have been known

92
00:03:39,878 --> 00:03:43,840
to escape their pens which can spread

93
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:46,119
disease to Native populations because

94
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,640
Farm fish are regularly fed antibiotics

95
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,560
because of their greater propensity for

96
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:52,919
disease and parasites uh many Farm fish

97
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,799
are genetically modified as well and can

98
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:57,039
contaminate native populations like I

99
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:59,799
mentioned above and their waste can

100
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:02,519
produce phytoplankton blooms which

101
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:04,560
destroy local ecology so we can safely

102
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:06,759
say that farm fish are not a reasonable

103
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,560
alternative to the meat

104
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:12,719
industry so what about wild CAU fish

105
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:14,878
then you know it's estimated that 80% of

106
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:17,639
the world's natural fish stocks are

107
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:20,519
fully to ere exploited depleted or in a

108
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:22,478
state of Collapse by catch is a term

109
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:24,680
referring to The Unwanted fish or other

110
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:26,199
Marine cat creatures that are caught by

111
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,199
commercial fishing

112
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:29,919
practices sometimes the amount of by

113
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:31,919
catch that is captured killed and

114
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:34,120
discarded can be as high as 80% for

115
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:36,359
certain Fisheries so this is something

116
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,120
like if they are fishing for a

117
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,960
particular fish species like salmon and

118
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:42,959
they catch an octopus or some other

119
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:45,239
animal that would be considered by catch

120
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:47,478
and scientists agree that a cur a

121
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,038
current exploitation levels that many

122
00:04:47,478 --> 00:04:51,639
important fish stocks will be removed

123
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:54,279
from the system within 25 years and

124
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:57,519
lastly there's a massive fossil fuel

125
00:04:54,279 --> 00:05:00,000
cost associated with wild C caught fish

126
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:02,159
both in the fishing itself and the

127
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,199
transportation of the fish that import

128
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,800
exportation associated with processing

129
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:08,560
that I mentioned before so basically

130
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,199
resources from the ocean can have

131
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:14,280
negative impacts on our environment and

132
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:17,600
challenges to sustainability as

133
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:19,599
well so I wanted to try and see what

134
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,560
research there was out on this so after

135
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,919
a little bit of digging I found a paper

136
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:26,439
entitled chemical characterization of

137
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:29,038
commercial organic fertilizers by Kurt

138
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:32,120
mhler that was published in 2015 in the

139
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:34,240
archives of agronomy and soil science uh

140
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:36,120
in this paper the authors talk about how

141
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,319
there are a wide range of commercial

142
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:41,199
organic fertilizers but not a lot of

143
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:44,879
research as to how heavy metals organic

144
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:47,160
pollutants like forever chemicals pcbs

145
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:49,600
pesticides and antibiotic residues

146
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:51,400
persist in these fertilizers and how

147
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,319
much variation you might see in these

148
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:54,879
fertilizers and it took me a while to

149
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:57,120
track down this paper as it wasn't

150
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:59,120
easily accessible online but it did

151
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,199
appear to address some of the original

152
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,439
idea of whether or not these fertilizers

153
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,639
are safe or should be avoided for the

154
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:06,800
reasons that I mentioned at the

155
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:09,680
beginning of the

156
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:12,598
talk so what they did was they took a

157
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,598
collection of uh 77 total fertilizer

158
00:06:12,598 --> 00:06:16,639
samples across a range of products

159
00:06:14,598 --> 00:06:19,800
ranging from feather meal bone meal

160
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:22,280
cocoa shells cloverg glass cloverg grass

161
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,400
pellets flax meal corn gluten-based

162
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:26,119
fertilizers and many more you can see

163
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:29,560
the list

164
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:33,160
here they analyze the material on a wide

165
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:36,720
iety parameters ranging from pH EC salt

166
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:40,319
content organic matter percentage NPK

167
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:44,520
trace minerals along with heavy metals

168
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:47,080
pesticides antibiotics GMOs and pcbs

169
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:49,680
those forever

170
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:51,159
chemicals here's some of what they found

171
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,879
and feel free to pause it if you want to

172
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,400
go back and look at the data but

173
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:56,199
depending on the product they

174
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:58,799
essentially found varying levels of

175
00:06:56,199 --> 00:07:00,919
heavy metals based on the product Source

176
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,960
basically all the fertilizers had some

177
00:07:00,918 --> 00:07:04,519
levels of heavy metals though many were

178
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:07,279
below the detection limits of the

179
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:09,359
equipment used in the

180
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:12,878
study and here's some more of that

181
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:15,240
information uh relating to um organic

182
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:17,199
persistent pollutant content and the

183
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:20,478
number of positive tests for salmonella

184
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:23,080
and pesticides in these

185
00:07:20,478 --> 00:07:24,758
fertilizers so I wanted to highlight

186
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:26,439
some of the author's comments and notes

187
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:28,919
in the study as they're related to the

188
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:31,079
safety of these different fertilizers

189
00:07:28,918 --> 00:07:33,038
and here they State the concentration of

190
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:35,359
persistent organic pollutants was close

191
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:37,478
to the detection limit on a very low

192
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,560
level for All sample IED sampled

193
00:07:37,478 --> 00:07:43,079
fertilizers so basically all the

194
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:45,639
fertilizers had very very low levels of

195
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:46,719
these pcbs um so there wasn't a big

196
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:48,360
difference between whether they were

197
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,360
plant-based or meat-based but they were

198
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,319
low across the board so that's that's a

199
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:56,598
relatively good sign in saying that from

200
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:58,879
a p from a perspective of uh pcbs pretty

201
00:07:56,598 --> 00:08:01,319
much all these fertilizers were safe um

202
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:03,879
an iotic compounds were not found and

203
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:06,479
all the samples were GMO free I think

204
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:08,639
this is an important statement because

205
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:10,519
um some of the argument I've been

206
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,038
hearing against using some of these

207
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:14,439
fertilizers is that they're going to be

208
00:08:12,038 --> 00:08:16,478
tainted with antibiotics and GMOs and

209
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:18,240
that just simply wasn't the case in this

210
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:20,878
study based on all the samples that they

211
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,960
took of you know specifically the blood

212
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:26,400
meal and the bone meal and only some

213
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:28,359
residues of few pesticides were found in

214
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:30,679
the few wastes of the food processing

215
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:33,599
industry incl including The Malt colbs

216
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:35,918
residues of the corn maze processing

217
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:39,120
grape pomes cocoa shells and potato

218
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:41,718
peels so the only fertilizers that had

219
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:45,519
any pesticide residue were actually the

220
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:47,320
plant-based ones which makes sense um so

221
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,919
pesticides is not a concern with the

222
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,760
bone meal or blood

223
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:53,719
meal as

224
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:55,278
well um here's another here's another

225
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,560
section that I thought was really

226
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:59,838
interesting so the toxic element

227
00:08:57,559 --> 00:09:02,719
contents of most sampled commercial

228
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:04,839
organic fertilizers were low compared to

229
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,200
values found for Source separated

230
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:10,720
organic Urban waste compost or

231
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:13,320
digestates poultry man manure or other

232
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,639
livestock manures so essentially what

233
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:19,399
they're saying here is that all these

234
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:23,679
organic fertilizers are much lower in

235
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:26,120
heavy metals compared to your compost

236
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:27,879
Source uh specifically they single out

237
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:30,440
poultry manure or other livestock

238
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:33,120
manures uh down below but essentially

239
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:35,160
most of these animal-based composts are

240
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,720
probably a much greater risk for

241
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:38,639
bringing in all of the things that we

242
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:42,160
talked about at the beginning of this

243
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:44,199
talk than your fertilizer however there

244
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:46,439
were some exceptions there was high

245
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,920
cadmium content in the waste of the corn

246
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,880
maze the maze corn processing probably

247
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:53,559
related to the high cadmium contents in

248
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:56,759
the soil so for any plant-based

249
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:58,958
fertilizer if that plant has the ability

250
00:09:56,759 --> 00:10:00,639
to take up those heavy metals and

251
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:02,958
there's heavy metals in the soil that

252
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:04,559
it's grown in it could potentially be

253
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:07,518
contaminated and that's something to

254
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:09,879
consider as well um but there wasn't

255
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,560
High cadmium content in the bone meal or

256
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:15,720
the blood meal or any of the meat-based

257
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:17,879
one now there was high lead contents in

258
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,639
Horn and Hooves which could be related

259
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:22,078
to contamination during the product

260
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:24,600
drying process using open fires in the

261
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:27,519
source countries so the way that they

262
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:30,120
Pro they the authors suspect that the

263
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:33,120
way that that product the horn and who

264
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:34,679
product was um processed is actually

265
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,399
what's leading to the high lead not

266
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:39,519
necessarily the initial U parent

267
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:42,039
material that was used to make it the

268
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:44,000
horns and hes themselves and the high

269
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:46,039
toxic element in micronutrient contents

270
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,600
in the potato peel based fertilizer

271
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:50,039
might be related to higher concentration

272
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,519
of these elements in the potato skin and

273
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:52,838
the nutrient grading of these elements

274
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,320
from the periphery towards the center of

275
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:57,200
the tubers so the idea here being that

276
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:00,639
the skin of the potato contained higher

277
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:02,600
levels or higher concentration of um

278
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:06,120
toxic elements so in this case heavy

279
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:08,278
metals or micronutrients than um the

280
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:11,159
actual flesh of the of the

281
00:11:08,278 --> 00:11:13,078
potato as well as potentially some soil

282
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:15,719
residues adhering to the skin of the

283
00:11:13,078 --> 00:11:18,199
potatoes from processing if that's soil

284
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:20,120
had higher levels of micronutrients or

285
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,920
heavy metals and then the low

286
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,679
micronutrient content in animal

287
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:26,278
fertilizers derived from slaughter house

288
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:28,278
activities was likewise noteworthy so

289
00:11:26,278 --> 00:11:30,759
they tend to be primarily just

290
00:11:28,278 --> 00:11:31,879
containing those Mac nutrients listed

291
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:34,519
above they don't have a lot of

292
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:35,519
micronutrient content which is fine

293
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:38,078
because that's something that we can

294
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:41,399
always pick up another

295
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:43,319
way so the measured contamination of the

296
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:45,879
sampled commercial organic fertilizers

297
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:48,000
with Organic pluts was several orders of

298
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:51,639
magnitude lower than the values reported

299
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,879
for organic Urban waste composts again I

300
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:56,560
just want to highlight it compost is

301
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:58,799
probably a much bigger risk and and

302
00:11:56,559 --> 00:12:00,719
source of contamination in your garden

303
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:02,799
than any of these commercial

304
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,600
fertilizers they also state that the

305
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:06,719
lack of any contamination with

306
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:09,360
antibiotic compounds in fertilizers

307
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:12,160
derived from animal slaughter houses is

308
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:15,199
surprising AS application of anotic

309
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:16,600
compounds has often become an a replied

310
00:12:15,198 --> 00:12:19,078
procedure in conventional animal

311
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:21,199
husbandry in the last decades so they're

312
00:12:19,078 --> 00:12:23,679
saying yes they they recognize the fact

313
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:26,240
that many of these animals were probably

314
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:29,198
um treated with antibiotics but they

315
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:32,320
were not finding any actual antibiotic

316
00:12:29,198 --> 00:12:34,559
compounds in the feather meal fish or

317
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,879
feather meal bone meal blood meal um the

318
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:40,078
ones associated with this

319
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:42,838
study um however only the minor ratio of

320
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:45,838
the supplied anabo compounds is absorbed

321
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:48,320
by The Animals 40 to 90% is excreted by

322
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,360
animal feces therefore the highest

323
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,680
pollution risk with antibiotic residues

324
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:55,278
can be expected in livestock manures as

325
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:58,879
confirmed by several

326
00:12:55,278 --> 00:13:01,000
studies so this makes total sense this

327
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:03,919
IDE aide that antibiotics are ending up

328
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,720
in your blood meal or bone meal is it

329
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:08,919
doesn't seem to be the case really those

330
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,800
things are moving through the animal

331
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:13,399
systems just like with humans and ending

332
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:17,039
up in the waste product so it's really

333
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:19,799
this poultry manure uh compost or maybe

334
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:21,599
Poulter manure fertilizer uh as well as

335
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:23,399
cow manure horse manure where you'd want

336
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,278
to be more concerned with antibiotics

337
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:31,120
and you may want to look for an organic

338
00:13:25,278 --> 00:13:31,120
Source input source to avoid antibiotics

339
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,560
contamination and now contamination with

340
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:37,759
pesticide residues was only found in

341
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:41,039
waste with a lowlevel of processing like

342
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:42,919
the grape The Malt and the cocoa shells

343
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:44,399
and many of the compounds found are used

344
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:45,759
during the storage of feed stock

345
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,480
materials so they may have been treated

346
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:51,399
with insecticides while they were being

347
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,120
stored um and many of the detected

348
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:56,720
residues of insecticides belong to

349
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:58,440
pyrethroids and they list below and and

350
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,480
some even a fungicide in the case of the

351
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:02,519
great pomade so again these plant-based

352
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,399
fertilizers were more likely to have

353
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:07,120
pesticide or fungicidal contamination

354
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:09,600
there was none found in any of the

355
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,600
meat-based

356
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,399
products and most of the commercial

357
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:16,440
organic fertilizers were derived from a

358
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,958
very complex industrial processes

359
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,279
including Heating and drying at the end

360
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:21,679
of the processes essentially this leads

361
00:14:20,278 --> 00:14:24,278
to deao

362
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:26,758
pasteurization so this pasteurization is

363
00:14:24,278 --> 00:14:28,720
going to kill off salmonella ecoli and a

364
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:31,240
lot of these pathogens as very few are

365
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,720
able to survive uh pasture the

366
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:36,120
pasteurization process and so then they

367
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,600
State therefore the hygienic status of

368
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,879
most of the commercial organic

369
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,959
fertilizers derived from these complex

370
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:44,958
processes in the food industry can be

371
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:47,479
assessed as High um there was one sample

372
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:49,359
of bone meal that tested positive for

373
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:51,560
salmonella probably resulting from a

374
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,759
reinfection after the heat treatment so

375
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:54,758
there may have been something in that

376
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:57,399
particular process that allowed there to

377
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:59,919
be potentially uh indicator bacteria for

378
00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:02,440
salmonella in it

379
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:04,159
now what about mad cows disease this is

380
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:06,320
another thing I've heard associated with

381
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:09,039
risks with using bone meal and I would

382
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:11,680
state that with any um organic

383
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:14,919
fertilizer that we're putting out uh one

384
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:17,439
should use proper PPE and in in the case

385
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:20,240
of things that are dusty like even

386
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:22,440
alphalpha meal for example you should

387
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,278
wear a mask or respirator to prevent

388
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,440
this stuff from getting into your lungs

389
00:15:24,278 --> 00:15:27,679
especially so though with these

390
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,199
animal-based ones because there are uh

391
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:30,719
things called prons which which are

392
00:15:29,198 --> 00:15:33,240
resistant to heat and normal

393
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:36,040
sterilization processes that can make it

394
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:37,720
through um this whole process that we

395
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:39,559
just talked about and there were four

396
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:42,879
deaths in Great Britain uh in the mid

397
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:44,599
90s from using bone meal uh from cattle

398
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:50,078
that had mad cows

399
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:52,720
disease but um they banned in 197 1997

400
00:15:50,078 --> 00:15:55,078
the FDA banned um using protein made

401
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:58,079
from ruminants like cows fed to other

402
00:15:55,078 --> 00:16:00,039
ruminants like pigs um and the primary

403
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:02,879
source is in commercial feed of cattle

404
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:05,240
to to an from an infectious

405
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:07,799
Source now one thing I learned that I

406
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:10,198
wasn't aware of is that mad cows disease

407
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:12,838
uh occurs spontaneously at very low

408
00:16:10,198 --> 00:16:15,958
levels in all cattle populations but

409
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:17,639
only five cases have ever been have

410
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:21,919
discovered and reported in the United

411
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:24,360
States uh ever so it it's happening at a

412
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:27,919
very low level and it's a very low risk

413
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:31,879
so you're I I would think that eating

414
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:33,759
um eating uh meat in a lot of cases if

415
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:35,838
you're eating anything that has may can

416
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:40,039
potentially contain brain or spinal cord

417
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:43,120
tissue that's a much higher risk than um

418
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:44,679
using bone meal in your product but I

419
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,198
just did want to address that because it

420
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:49,359
is something that people um bring up as

421
00:16:47,198 --> 00:16:51,318
a potential risk but I in terms of the

422
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:54,639
risk level of it I just want to state

423
00:16:51,318 --> 00:16:56,679
that it appears to be fairly low so what

424
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:59,360
about blood meal this was another

425
00:16:56,679 --> 00:17:02,159
interesting one because I

426
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,759
saw on a website um from a popular

427
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:07,159
company stating that blood meal is full

428
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:08,599
of antibiotics and pathogens and so I

429
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:10,120
wanted to research this because that to

430
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:12,838
me is pretty scary and I don't want to

431
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:15,558
use anything like that uh so I did I

432
00:17:12,838 --> 00:17:17,958
wasted a good morning one day before the

433
00:17:15,558 --> 00:17:19,639
summit trying to find anything on Google

434
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:21,558
Scholar that related to blood meal

435
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,640
containing pathogens containing

436
00:17:21,558 --> 00:17:25,838
antibiotics or anything about blood

437
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:28,120
meals a fertilizer uh that might relate

438
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:31,359
to this and I was unable to find any

439
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:33,599
research to support these claims in fact

440
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:35,279
um it was only listed on this one

441
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:37,759
website which I think it's been

442
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:40,038
subsequently removed now and one other

443
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:43,000
website that used it as a citation to

444
00:17:40,038 --> 00:17:45,000
spread this message and this was I I

445
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,519
show you here one of the web the two

446
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,798
websites I mentioned so what I want to

447
00:17:48,519 --> 00:17:52,160
say is there's no research that I've

448
00:17:49,798 --> 00:17:53,960
been able to find to support this claim

449
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:58,120
and it would go directly against the

450
00:17:53,960 --> 00:18:01,120
study that I mentioned uh in this um in

451
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:03,678
this talk and manure-based composts and

452
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:06,079
Commercial organic fertilizers may be

453
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:09,038
way more problematic than your blood

454
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:11,319
meal one paper found that I found showed

455
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:16,400
that repeated applications of chicken or

456
00:18:11,319 --> 00:18:18,558
swine Pig based uh manure um incre uh

457
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,640
fertilizers increased antibiotic levels

458
00:18:18,558 --> 00:18:22,279
in soils but then most most of it

459
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,440
dissipated over the course of a couple

460
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:27,918
months but not completely so even worst

461
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,720
case you are getting antibiotics they're

462
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:33,360
not persistent ing terribly long in the

463
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,759
soil which I thought was was interesting

464
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:37,599
enough to share these amox are poorly

465
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:40,279
absorbed and metabolized so much of it

466
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:42,678
isre excreted in the waste of animals

467
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:44,519
and humans and there's very little

468
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:48,720
research on the impact of Veterinary

469
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:48,720
antibiotics on soil ecosystems

470
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,400
unfortunately so what if we want to

471
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:55,000
avoid animals or fish Al together or

472
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,679
look into alternative options in the

473
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,240
ones I've already

474
00:18:56,679 --> 00:19:03,280
mentioned what about what about

475
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:05,919
then well neem has a massive fossil fuel

476
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:07,839
cost relative to other products uh you

477
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:10,600
know we're shipping it all the way from

478
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:13,439
India it has the potential for heavy

479
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:16,038
metals and pesticide residues even on

480
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:19,360
organic products um I've mentioned this

481
00:19:16,038 --> 00:19:20,440
before on on the podcast in other talks

482
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:23,319
where

483
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:25,360
um Su my friend Suzanne Wayne rght Evans

484
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:29,480
had worked with a farm who had failed

485
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:31,519
for a uh a chemistry of pesticides

486
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:33,079
that's no longer allowed for use in the

487
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:36,319
United States and hasn't been allowed

488
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:39,359
since the 70s um and and they tracked it

489
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:42,038
down after their cannabis crop failing

490
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:44,678
Unfortunately they tracked it down to uh

491
00:19:42,038 --> 00:19:47,558
the neem oil product they were using and

492
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:49,559
so essentially that neem seed meal had

493
00:19:47,558 --> 00:19:51,399
been crushed the oil had been extracted

494
00:19:49,558 --> 00:19:52,879
and there was enough residue of

495
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:55,000
pesticides that had been sprayed onto

496
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:59,159
that neem tree that it made it into the

497
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,759
oil and then contaminated the product so

498
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:03,720
basically the point here neem is not a

499
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:06,240
perfect option or solution either so

500
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:08,759
what about soft rock phosphates well

501
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:11,200
it's a minded product so it's going to

502
00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:14,279
contain heavy metals uh there's really

503
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:16,319
no way around that um and it has large

504
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:18,200
fossil fuel costs not only the mining

505
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:21,000
process itself but the transportation of

506
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:22,840
the product so um you know there may be

507
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,079
mines that are cleaner in other

508
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:27,480
countries outside of North America but

509
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:29,599
the cost to get that product here is a

510
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:31,120
massive fossil fuel cost that one should

511
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:32,359
account for when considering what

512
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:35,479
products they want to use in their

513
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:38,199
Garden if you want to be ecological and

514
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:41,919
sustainable uh same goes for guos you

515
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:43,319
know um they work but large fossil fuel

516
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:46,240
costs associated with them they're

517
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:48,879
harvested overseas they damage the local

518
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:51,919
ecology with that harvesting in many

519
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:55,240
cases um and they're not

520
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:57,240
sustainable so what are more sustainable

521
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:59,519
options or

522
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:02,720
Alternatives how about Al

523
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:04,319
alpham alphalpha has massive water

524
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,400
requirements now don't get me wrong I

525
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:08,960
love alala it's something that I use in

526
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:12,320
almost every Garden prescription that I

527
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:15,640
make um but it has a relatively low NPK

528
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:17,480
it requires a lot of uh water to grow it

529
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:19,840
it it is a wonderful microbial Source

530
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:21,400
but it's not perfect and I guess that's

531
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:24,918
the point I really want to

532
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:27,240
make so if we want to talk about you

533
00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:29,360
know sustainability then we really have

534
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:31,440
to look at reducing our carbon footprint

535
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:33,839
and our inputs this means learning to

536
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,519
cultivate with fewer inputs and not

537
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:39,038
falling for the marketing around hype

538
00:21:36,519 --> 00:21:42,038
products uh or things in the bottles

539
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:44,759
that we may really not need and so if we

540
00:21:42,038 --> 00:21:47,558
want to talk about sustainability insect

541
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:50,839
frass to me is really one of the most

542
00:21:47,558 --> 00:21:53,278
sustainable nutrient sources available

543
00:21:50,839 --> 00:21:55,000
uh on the market today unfortunately

544
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:58,000
though it does have limited sources and

545
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,720
it has variable quality um but it is the

546
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,278
most sustainable option for closing a

547
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:03,319
loop in our food supply because we can

548
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:05,558
feed our food waste to these insects

549
00:22:03,319 --> 00:22:08,000
they can process it and then their

550
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:11,079
essentially their manure uh tends to be

551
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,278
very clean it tends to be um have

552
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:15,558
contain good microbial activity in

553
00:22:13,278 --> 00:22:18,038
biomass and it it it tends to be a

554
00:22:15,558 --> 00:22:20,079
pretty good product well what about

555
00:22:18,038 --> 00:22:22,599
compost and manures those are also a

556
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:25,960
great option however they can contain

557
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:27,678
Plastics antibiotics pesticides and

558
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:29,240
pathogens so really if we want to talk

559
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,640
about what

560
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:33,839
I mean if we want to look at what what's

561
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:37,880
organic and what's fake organic truly

562
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:40,079
our compost and manures have much much

563
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:42,440
more risk associated with them and much

564
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:43,558
more contamination associated with them

565
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,519
and I think that's just something that

566
00:22:43,558 --> 00:22:48,678
we need to recognize when we're making a

567
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:51,278
decision in our garden and I say this as

568
00:22:48,679 --> 00:22:53,840
someone who loves compost highly

569
00:22:51,278 --> 00:22:56,079
advocates for compost we just need to be

570
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:59,158
careful with it and not demonize certain

571
00:22:56,079 --> 00:23:00,879
products over other products um

572
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:01,960
based on an agenda that may or may not

573
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,080
be

574
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:05,558
accurate compost is probably going to

575
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:07,599
contain heavy metals so we need to use

576
00:23:05,558 --> 00:23:10,399
it sparingly if we're in a regulated

577
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:13,719
state or if that comp the compost inputs

578
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:15,440
contain heavy metals um and ultimately

579
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:18,839
where where we land is trying to Source

580
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:22,080
things locally and so even folks that

581
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:24,879
purchase soil from us that we we ship to

582
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:27,879
them we then try to work with them to

583
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:31,120
use the fewest number of inputs as

584
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:32,679
possible in order to grow uh healthy

585
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:35,158
products and should try and Source

586
00:23:32,679 --> 00:23:37,240
things as much as they can locally now

587
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:39,440
the limitations with locally sourcing

588
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:41,519
things is limited options you may not be

589
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,519
able to get all of the products you want

590
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:46,079
or clean versions of those products

591
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:48,359
locally um and that's just the reality

592
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:50,639
of the situation and that may lead you

593
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:53,759
to having to purchase some things online

594
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:56,520
and have them shipped to you but the

595
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:59,079
best thing that we can do is reuse our

596
00:23:56,519 --> 00:24:00,200
soil and reduce our inputs while

597
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:03,558
maintaining

598
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:06,960
fertility and the the point of this

599
00:24:03,558 --> 00:24:09,720
whole talk is really not to say that

600
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,440
like one input is better than another

601
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:13,558
I'm not here to say that blood meal or

602
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,600
bone meal or feather meal are superior

603
00:24:13,558 --> 00:24:17,599
to Fishbone meal or fish meal or other

604
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:20,199
sources you know I could have made the

605
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:23,038
same talk around M products like rock

606
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:25,440
dust or Pete Moss versus Coco core or

607
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:27,119
just about any other input in our garden

608
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,240
I wanted to put together this talk as a

609
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:31,918
way of encouraging Growers to think

610
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:34,558
critically and separate out a marketing

611
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:36,720
message from reality a lot of times

612
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:38,759
these messages are crafted to sell you

613
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,200
products by allowing a company company

614
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:43,919
to differentiate themselves around the

615
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:46,480
message and sometimes these messages or

616
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:48,640
concepts can be really powerful because

617
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,798
they tug on our emotions or fit with our

618
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:53,038
values but when you dig just a little

619
00:24:50,798 --> 00:24:56,398
bit deeper the reality of it can be

620
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:58,398
entirely different so in closing I want

621
00:24:56,398 --> 00:25:00,278
to challenge you to think critically and

622
00:24:58,398 --> 00:25:03,278
deeply about how you cultivate this

623
00:25:00,278 --> 00:25:05,038
plant be open-minded to new ideas but

624
00:25:03,278 --> 00:25:06,679
also do your own research and don't

625
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:09,319
accept anything that you hear at face

626
00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:11,440
value regardless of how authoritative or

627
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:13,439
knowledgeable this person may be or how

628
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:17,759
many followers they may have on social

629
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:21,320
media so whether you practice jadam or

630
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:23,679
knf or biodynamics or soil food web at

631
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:25,798
the end of the day there's wisdom and

632
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:27,960
misinformation in every one of these

633
00:25:25,798 --> 00:25:29,759
methods it wasn't until my good friend

634
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:31,558
Tim Wilson called me out about some

635
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:33,599
things that I was saying about compost

636
00:25:31,558 --> 00:25:35,918
te that I had heard from the foremost

637
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:38,719
expert in the industry and challenged me

638
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:40,759
to test it out for myself that I became

639
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,200
a more critical thinker and it made me a

640
00:25:40,759 --> 00:25:45,440
better grower you can always trial new

641
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,600
ideas or products in a test plot in your

642
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,080
garden too if you make a hypothesis and

643
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:52,398
take a scientific Approach at the end of

644
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:54,240
the day though regardless of what method

645
00:25:52,398 --> 00:25:55,918
you use or what amendments you choose to

646
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,839
use in your garden there's a million

647
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:59,840
ways to grow this plant and as long as

648
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:02,158
you're being thoughtful and with an eye

649
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:04,839
towards sustainability then it's all

650
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:06,520
good in my book thanks for checking out

651
00:26:04,839 --> 00:26:11,558
this talk please reach out if you have

652
00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:11,558
any questions I really appreciate it
