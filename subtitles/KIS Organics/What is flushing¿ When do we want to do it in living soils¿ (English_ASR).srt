1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,720
okay let's talk about flushing and by

2
00:00:02,678 --> 00:00:06,199
flushing I don't mean removing a bunch

3
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:08,000
of nutrients from the soil at the end of

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,719
the flower cycle as a way of improving

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,400
the quality of flour that's really a

6
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:14,239
hydro concept and doesn't apply to

7
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,879
organic living soils when I say flushing

8
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,679
what I'm talking about is running a

9
00:00:15,878 --> 00:00:20,679
bunch of water through the media through

10
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:22,118
our soil as a way of reducing levels of

11
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:23,920
certain nutrients that have gotten

12
00:00:22,118 --> 00:00:26,160
excessive either over time or due to

13
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,519
your amendments or inputs over over the

14
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,359
course of a cycle this is typically

15
00:00:28,518 --> 00:00:33,719
Associated on tests with sodium chloride

16
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,520
or nitrates uh sodium is not an

17
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:37,879
essential mineral for plants they don't

18
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,320
need it and it will cause plant stress

19
00:00:37,878 --> 00:00:42,439
and potentially raise the EC or soluble

20
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,079
salt level of the soil creating osmotic

21
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:45,718
pressure in the root system this will

22
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,039
stress your plant so we want to keep

23
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:50,399
those levels as low as possible uh

24
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:53,679
typically sodium comes in with water uh

25
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:56,480
fermented plant extracts teas um it can

26
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:57,960
come in with a bunch of C based

27
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:59,119
amendments uh and it's just something

28
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,679
that you want to Monitor and will show

29
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:02,358
up on your soil test

30
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:04,438
chlorides plants only need a small

31
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:06,118
amount I typically associate this with

32
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:07,879
water but you can see it in high levels

33
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:11,478
with some amendments and other things

34
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:14,118
too and then lastly is nitrates um I see

35
00:01:11,478 --> 00:01:16,799
a lot of tests with really high nitrates

36
00:01:14,118 --> 00:01:18,319
and this is pretty common because people

37
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,439
want to people want to feel like they're

38
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:20,719
feeding their plant and they want to

39
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:23,399
feel like they're contributing to their

40
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:25,438
plant growing bigger and rather than

41
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,478
leave a good thing alone they add more

42
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:30,679
teas whether that's a compost tea a

43
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:33,280
fermented plant extract a um

44
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:35,479
you know whatever kind of tea nutrient

45
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,680
tea um and these are all bringing in

46
00:01:35,478 --> 00:01:39,438
nitrogen on some level most likely and

47
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,960
those nitrates are going to cause high

48
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:44,599
levels of nitrates are going to cause

49
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:46,078
excessive um Spa inter node spacing

50
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:48,359
that's the distance between your nodes

51
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:51,158
here that can get really big um you'll

52
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:53,159
typically see uh excessively green

53
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:56,880
plants and that clawing of the leaf

54
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:58,840
surface and um you're opening yourself

55
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:00,078
up to more Pest and pathogen pressure

56
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,200
and you're reducing your yield s

57
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:03,679
dramatically so just by flushing that

58
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,000
bed and removing the nitrates you should

59
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,920
see a dramatic Improvement in the

60
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,919
quality of your crop so when we're

61
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,920
talking about flushing and how to flush

62
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:12,199
what we're going to do is we're going to

63
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:14,280
run a whole bunch of very clean water

64
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:17,439
that's not high in sodium or chlorides

65
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:19,239
through our soil typically at 10 or 20%

66
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:21,759
of the total volume chlorides are a

67
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:24,200
little harder to move out than sodium is

68
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:26,679
but we want to try and flush that stuff

69
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:29,039
out retest see how our levels have

70
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,519
dropped and then re amend any essential

71
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:32,959
plant minerals that might have been

72
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:34,719
flushed out as well uh unfortunately

73
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,800
it's way too common that we see tests

74
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:38,080
where we have to recommend flushing that

75
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,000
doesn't mean you're not going to make it

76
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,200
through the cycle if you don't flush it

77
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,519
just means that we want to we're not

78
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:43,560
going to be quite as optimal as we want

79
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:45,640
to be and it's something that you want

80
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,920
to manage with your inputs and with the

81
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:49,238
quality of your water over time so hope

82
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:53,000
that helps explain it and thanks for

83
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:53,000
checking it out
