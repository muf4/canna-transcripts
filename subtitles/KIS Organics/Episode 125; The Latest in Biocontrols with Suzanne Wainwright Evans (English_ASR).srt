where we discuss The Cutting Edge of

6
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,359
growing from a science-based perspective

7

thanks for coming back on the show I

26
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:12,559
really appreciate

27
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:14,040
it hey Tad how are you doing I'm good

28
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,759
it's so nice to be able to catch up with

29
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,719
you uh it's been way too long and I know

30
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:20,879
we've gotten requests to find out more

31
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:24,920
about what's been going on in the bug

32
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:27,039
world in relation to cannabis uh

33
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:29,560
ornamental crops um what do you what do

34
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,118
you have to share with us today well I

35
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,000
guess it's partly my fault I have not

36
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:37,640
been back in a while because last year I

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,078
was everywhere on the planet um I had um

38
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,359
I went to a bio Control meeting in

39
00:01:39,078 --> 00:01:42,798
France I was at another bio Control

40
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:45,280
meeting in England along with

41
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,680
crisscrossing across the US and Canada I

42
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:51,640
think there was one day last month I was

43
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,759
home uh like four days last year it was

44
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,519
like I think it was like November I was

45
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:57,799
home four days out of the month because

46
00:01:54,519 --> 00:02:00,359
I've been traveling so much uh between

47
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:02,360
conferences and uh working with Growers

48
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:04,840
and their pest issues so I I'll take the

49
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:07,599
blame on not being around but I'm glad

50
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:09,800
we have today before I take back off I I

51
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:11,079
just got back from um the man show in

52
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,360
Baltimore last night and I'm heading

53
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:15,599
down to Florida on Monday for the tpie

54
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,920
show but along the

55
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:19,799
way um I picked up some really

56
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:21,119
interesting information and I've seen

57
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,120
some cool things that I think would be

58
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,878
good to talk about and one of the new

59
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,519
things I'm super excited about and know

60
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:28,639
this is not a paid advertisement and

61
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:30,439
know they're not paying me money is that

62
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:33,639
byw works has this new product called EP

63
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:38,120
shield and I'm super duper excited about

64
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:40,559
it um because one of the The Stumbling

65
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,480
box we have with pesticides always is

66
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,199
re-entry intervals after you apply a

67
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:46,598
pesticide you can't go back in for so

68
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:48,280
many hours for worker safety this

69
00:02:46,598 --> 00:02:51,679
particular product does not have a

70
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:53,519
re-entry interval so that means you can

71
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,959
spray it and your workers can go right

72
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:58,800
back in um without having to wait

73
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,840
because it's considered very safe for

74
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,280
humans to be around

75
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,000
um the other thing that I'm super

76
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:07,120
excited about is you can dip cuting in

77
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,598
it um you know we've had a lot of

78
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,439
challenges with seoil X because you know

79
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:13,719
I love that product and it does so many

80
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:15,318
great things but we do not technically

81
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:17,439
have a dipping label for the United

82
00:03:15,318 --> 00:03:20,318
States Canada does have a dipping label

83
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:24,479
but we do not in the US with the EP

84
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:30,119
Shield uh you are going to be able to uh

85
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:33,318
dip in it and since it is on this 25 B

86
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:36,200
EPA registration exempt list you can

87
00:03:33,318 --> 00:03:39,639
adjust your dipping rates uh that are

88
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:41,639
appropriate for your crop so that if you

89
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:43,318
find that your crop may be more

90
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:44,919
sensitive you can lower it or if you

91
00:03:43,318 --> 00:03:46,598
want to try to get higher efficacy you

92
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:48,878
might be able to raise it a little bit I

93
00:03:46,598 --> 00:03:50,839
mean there's a window to work in there

94
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:52,878
which bioworks has done a ton of

95
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:55,319
phytotoxicity testing with it they've

96
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:57,158
been testing tons of crops to see if

97
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:58,958
there are any issues and they have um

98
00:03:57,158 --> 00:04:01,479
lists available of all the crops but for

99
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:04,360
the most part it's looking very safe um

100
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:06,840
to dip your products in uh the main

101
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,640
target for it is two spot spidermite and

102
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,640
one of the things I'm excited about to

103
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:12,919
is it does kill all live stages of two

104
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:16,719
spot spidermite including the egg which

105
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:19,560
some of the other Botanical oils do not

106
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:23,199
so that's a huge Advantage there and

107
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:25,319
also the rates on it are super duper low

108
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:28,600
um it's like 10 times lower than some of

109
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:30,719
the other oil application rates so that

110
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,439
reduces the risk of phto that keeps your

111
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,039
cost down and so there's just you know a

112
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:37,120
lot of benefits to it um it's one of

113
00:04:36,038 --> 00:04:39,159
those things that's looking very

114
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,639
compatible um with a lot of the

115
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,120
beneficials in the sense of yes if a

116
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:44,840
predatory might sitting on a leaf and

117
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,800
you douse it in it you're going to kill

118
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:49,799
it but uh some of the trial work that's

119
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:52,120
been going on actually at Growers um one

120
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,160
particular ornamental grower that's been

121
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,280
releasing

122
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,960
californicus uh and they've been using

123
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:58,799
the EP Shield injunction with the

124
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,918
californicus they're still finding

125
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,840
californicus running around in the crop

126
00:05:00,918 --> 00:05:06,519
even with using epip Shield uh to kill

127
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:08,839
the spidermites and so we think it has

128
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:10,478
to do with how uh predatory mites

129
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:12,719
deposit their eggs on the undersides of

130
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:14,079
the leaves in the Doma and it's very

131
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,360
difficult to get spray coverage there so

132
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:20,198
they're kind of out of the way of of the

133
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:23,120
spray but uh I'm I'm really excited

134
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:24,800
again especially with the uh no REI and

135
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,478
and the dipping on this I think this

136
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,800
product's going to be a really good for

137
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:34,560
bioworks

138
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,759
yeah so I recently did a post on why I

139
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,199
am using seoil X in my garden and there

140
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:41,400
was a little bit of push back from some

141
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:43,160
folks regarding um the fact that it's a

142
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:45,079
petroleum based product I know you and I

143
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,400
talk about how we use Vaseline and

144
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:48,918
there's a lot of other things that we

145
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:51,959
should probably be more concerned about

146
00:05:48,918 --> 00:05:53,799
um in our lives than a petroleum based

147
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:58,279
uh or mineral mineral oil based product

148
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:59,520
but um the the EP Shield I just Dr

149
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:02,000
Michael brownbridge just sent me an

150
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:03,599
email not that long ago about it and the

151
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,800
the things that stood out to me were

152
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,840
it's a 25b product I believe it was

153
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:11,639
clove oil I have to go back and look was

154
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:14,159
the main ingredient um but the coverage

155
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:16,560
on it looked um like the particle size

156
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,240
was smaller so the coverage looked

157
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,399
better and so like you said there's less

158
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,519
residual on the leaf surface and um

159
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:25,598
normally with 20 Vib products I tend to

160
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:27,799
be more skeptical mostly because coming

161
00:06:25,598 --> 00:06:30,680
from you I realized that there tends to

162
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,560
be less research on efficacy around them

163
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,280
but bioworks has such a wonderful

164
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,839
reputation in this industry for the

165
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:39,318
level of research and data that they

166
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:40,399
bring to the table and um yeah I'm just

167
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:41,840
really excited about it I have a lot

168
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:43,839
more confidence in it I have a couple

169
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:46,478
samples in the mail right now on their

170
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:47,839
way to the farm and I can't wait to

171
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:50,359
start playing around with it and using

172
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:53,439
it because um personally I would feel

173
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:55,720
better using a you know a clove oil

174
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:58,000
based product um if the efficacy is

175
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,160
there over you know even suff oil X or

176
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,598
something like that and the dip rate

177
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,879
thing I didn't know so that's really

178
00:07:00,598 --> 00:07:05,478
exciting yeah and it's a combination of

179
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:07,680
peppermint clove and a surfactant in

180
00:07:05,478 --> 00:07:10,680
there um

181
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:14,120
and um the entomologists that developed

182
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,720
it uh tried lots of different you know

183
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,519
it's finding that sweet spot of killing

184
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:20,199
insects without damaging plants and he

185
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:21,839
worked very hard on developing this and

186
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:25,400
as you said

187
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:28,758
bioworks they will not just you know oh

188
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:31,079
here's a product they ran trials on this

189
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:33,360
for an extensive amount of time to make

190
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:36,560
sure they have all the data all the

191
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,360
research and that it works um they're

192
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,079
not just uh you know we'll bring

193
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,560
anything to Market kind of company um

194
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:45,639
they're very particular about what they

195
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,680
do sell and with their team of experts

196
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:50,560
like Dr Michael brownbridge and and

197
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,759
Julie Gres and Dr Chris Hayes I mean

198
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,918
they've really got an amazing lineup of

199
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:57,000
people there uh because they it's their

200
00:07:55,918 --> 00:07:59,878
reputation and they're not going to

201
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,158
bring a bad product to Market and

202
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:04,879
I I I am I'm so always skeptical about

203
00:08:03,158 --> 00:08:06,079
essential oil products you know we call

204
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,680
them salad

205
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:11,680
dressings and this one has actually

206
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:16,120
changed my mind a bit more on some of

207
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:17,598
these products because of um of just

208
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:21,000
mainly the efficacy and they've done

209
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:22,959
work on cannabis aphid and it's uh for

210
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,120
Target P two spot spidermite is what

211
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:28,239
initially was the main focus but they

212
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,360
definitely have efficacy on apids and

213
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,759
you know they've done some work on

214
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:34,560
cannabis aphid they've done work on

215
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:38,000
whiteflies it does provide some efficacy

216
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:40,439
on thrips but it it it's not like the

217
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,839
home run on thrips like it is with two

218
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:46,440
spot spidermites so more uh work will be

219
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,680
coming looking at different rates uh

220
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:51,200
looking at different species of thrips

221
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:52,599
different aphids and everything so uh

222
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,160
there will be a lot more information

223
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:58,000
coming um and also the product it it it

224
00:08:56,159 --> 00:09:01,000
it smells

225
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,278
like like like

226
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,559
clean Dental mint kind of thing so it's

227
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:11,879
not a overwhelming smell which sometimes

228
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:14,039
can be an issue um so it it's not an

229
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:16,078
it's almost like a a super light winter

230
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:17,480
green maybe it's it's hard to explain

231
00:09:16,078 --> 00:09:20,599
the

232
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:21,800
aroma so could this in theory for for

233
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,440
Growers

234
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:27,359
potentially be something they could use

235
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:29,920
comparable to suff oil X down the road

236
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,879
in terms of the efficacy of it

237
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:38,399
and use use rates spidermites I'm

238
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:42,278
believing so um aphids probably not sure

239
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:44,958
about thrips yet because again

240
00:09:42,278 --> 00:09:47,759
um it's it's not quite as strong as a

241
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:51,359
thrips product um but again you have to

242
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:53,240
look at your crop and you know look at

243
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,159
all the the differences between the two

244
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:58,120
and decide which one's best for your

245
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:59,719
application and what you're

246
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:02,200
doing

247
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:04,000
but yeah well I might do something with

248
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:06,600
Michael talking about it here soon

249
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,759
anyway that was on my list of potential

250
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:11,440
upcoming podcast topics so I'm glad we

251
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:12,919
were able to talk about it now yeah no

252
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,760
I'm excited because again it's in the

253
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:16,439
hands of um you know a bunch of my

254
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:19,519
Growers now and you know getting

255
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:25,240
feedback from them so that's uh super

256
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:27,560
exciting um on that so um so uh I guess

257
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:30,000
we'll move on from EP shield and the

258
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:33,518
other thing which may not be as exciting

259
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:37,879
for everybody but again I still think is

260
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:41,679
um super exciting is uh you know biob um

261
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:43,360
the in you know they're one of the uh I

262
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:45,359
used to think of them as not one of the

263
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,360
big boy insector but now I'm definitely

264
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:51,039
inking them more into you know this big

265
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:54,879
boy category um because of their product

266
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:57,799
line and uh the team they put together

267
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:59,519
um but they are now actually selling a

268
00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:02,519
blower which I'm super super excited

269
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:04,679
about because for a lot of people when

270
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:06,759
you have to apply over large areas

271
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:09,239
people were having to hand sprinkle out

272
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:11,838
predatory mites or you had to build your

273
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:15,440
own blower you had to buy a blower you

274
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:17,440
know get PVC pipe attach a funnel on it

275
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,560
with a ball valve and try to get you and

276
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:23,079
work all this out but biob now actually

277
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:25,479
has for sale a blower that they've

278
00:11:23,078 --> 00:11:28,000
essentially kind of calibrated for you

279
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:29,320
it's adjustable and so people don't want

280
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,320
to build this and they want to be able

281
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:34,480
to blow out things like predatory

282
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:37,000
mites um lacewing larvae and things like

283
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,120
that over larger areas which not

284
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,799
necessarily something you're going to do

285
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:43,959
you know for um you know well spaced out

286
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:46,359
cannabis plants but for propagation or

287
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:47,919
for people doing ornamentals vegetables

288
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:50,680
we're really excited to actually have a

289
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:52,199
blower for sale now um and it's working

290
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:53,799
really well I've gotten feedback from my

291
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:57,959
Growers and they've all been pretty

292
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:59,639
happy with it um and again they have

293
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:02,518
like application chart showing which

294
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:05,560
beneficial you're using how to dial in

295
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:07,839
the adjustments on it and everything um

296
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:09,919
and so I'm pretty excited about that to

297
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:13,680
have a new piece of equipment for

298
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:15,719
application because you know application

299
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:17,559
for a lot of my Growers the application

300
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,079
of beneficials is the limiting factor

301
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:21,759
because of the cost of application of

302
00:12:19,078 --> 00:12:23,439
Labor because applying uh beneficials

303
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:26,759
can be very labor intensive especially

304
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:30,800
when we have to te treat 10 20 30 acres

305
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:33,240
and having these automated things are um

306
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:35,198
you know pretty exciting which includes

307
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:38,879
and again it doesn't affect your people

308
00:12:35,198 --> 00:12:40,838
as much but uh biob besta Europe uh now

309
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:43,000
has uh a piece of equipment called the

310
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:45,040
enomatic and it can attach to the back

311
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,078
of tractors to go out and do large farm

312
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:49,439
fields to apply predatory mites at an

313
00:12:47,078 --> 00:12:51,719
incredibly fast rate so they can you

314
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,240
know go down the middle and they've got

315
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,759
these long booms and the air flow

316
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,120
carries the predatory mites and they're

317
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:59,399
applied out like on the Strawberry

318
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:02,519
Fields so it's going to going to allow

319
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:05,159
for larger acre applications of

320
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:06,919
beneficials that we uh were struggling

321
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:08,879
to do and you know the Drone

322
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:11,198
Technology's been coming along parab

323
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:12,879
bug's been doing amazing thing with

324
00:13:11,198 --> 00:13:15,078
applying beneficials but not everybody

325
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:16,320
can use drones for applications because

326
00:13:15,078 --> 00:13:19,599
if you're near the

327
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,920
airport um or if you don't have a

328
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,360
licensed person near you or if you don't

329
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:25,519
want to get a drone license this is

330
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:29,000
going to be an option for large scale

331
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:30,799
application uh the timatic um if you

332
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,440
can't use drone applications because you

333
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:34,519
know again not everybody can uh do that

334
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,680
I don't know if you've seen any of the

335
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:39,198
videos online or anything of

336
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:40,958
those I have yeah I've seen the drones

337
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:43,439
actually at trade shows at bio controls

338
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:46,919
conference or bio Solutions conference

339
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:49,360
what they call themselves now yeah yeah

340
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:51,879
uh on that note I just want to add we've

341
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,320
been working exclusively with biob now

342
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:55,399
for a couple years offering their

343
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:57,879
beneficial insects shipped direct from

344
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:59,519
insectary and uh they've been wonderful

345
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:01,360
to work with I really love the quality

346
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,720
of the insects they arrive in great

347
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:07,000
shape um just a friendly reminder to

348
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:08,879
folks whatever your bug provider is I

349
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,679
hope it can be kiss Organics but if it's

350
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:12,759
not make sure that you're getting them

351
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:14,879
directly from the insectary shipped to

352
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:16,360
you so that they're not being repacked

353
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:17,759
just to maintain viability I'm just

354
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:21,240
saying what Suzanne has said over

355
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:23,278
multiple podcasts over the years um on

356
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:25,039
that note I I want to also mention

357
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:26,120
because you mentioned Cool Tools one

358
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:27,719
thing that that's been around for a

359
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:31,159
little while now that I know you're a

360
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:34,360
fan of I recently applied SF nematodes

361
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:37,799
in my tiny garden at my house I don't

362
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:40,879
need a tool but for a facility the uh

363
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:42,519
nematode um bucket I don't know the

364
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:43,919
actual name of it I know that I've seen

365
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:45,639
that and it's something that you really

366
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:47,439
like uh I don't know if you want to

367
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:49,720
touch on that since you mentioned a you

368
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,199
know a grower tool for applying

369
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:54,079
beneficials that uh is kind of unique

370
00:14:52,198 --> 00:14:56,039
and and interesting you know what's

371
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:58,758
funny is I call it the nimod bucket it's

372
00:14:56,039 --> 00:15:00,399
made by a drram and I honestly don't

373
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:02,000
know the real name which is terrible

374
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,879
because I've demonstrated it at

375
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,759
workshops and I was just talking at the

376
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:09,198
man show this week with Kurt Becker um

377
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:11,639
and we were talking about the nematode

378
00:15:09,198 --> 00:15:14,240
bucket and in the back of my mind I was

379
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:17,480
saying you guys need to put a vinyl

380
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,799
nimoe on the bucket like a cutout to

381
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,360
make people think about that but then

382
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:23,120
I'm like oh my gosh that sounds like

383
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:25,120
such like a like a a girly thing to do

384
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:28,440
so I didn't tell it to him because I

385
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:30,120
think you know it it I think it'd be a

386
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,759
great branding thing just to call it the

387
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,959
nematode bucket because that's mostly

388
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,199
what people use it for it can be used

389
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:36,958
for fertilizers also um and

390
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:39,559
biopesticides and stuff but the reality

391
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:41,919
is is most people that are using it and

392
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:43,879
it's and it sounds simple but let me

393
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:46,240
tell you it is not simple necessarily to

394
00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:48,559
engineer it's it's a bucket that has a

395
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:52,240
motor in the base that not only arates

396
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:55,638
but circulates nematodes in a Vortex and

397
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:58,079
it keeps the water oxygenated so that if

398
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:59,879
you're applying nematodes uh they don't

399
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:01,919
drown and they don't settle out because

400
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:04,439
nematodes will settle out pretty fast in

401
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:06,639
water and I have had some Growers try to

402
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:09,480
build their own systems and the problems

403
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:11,600
they ran into is uh sometimes the motors

404
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,159
heat up too much the compressed air gets

405
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,040
too hot and they end up cooking the

406
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:18,439
nematodes or what can happen is you if

407
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:20,480
you get like a dead spot in your bucket

408
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:22,480
or container the nematodes can get

409
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:26,360
caught up in those corners and you don't

410
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:28,720
get um all the nematodes out at an even

411
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:31,039
application and uh they worked on wanted

412
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:35,920
a couple years to get the design right

413
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:38,879
for it um so uh yeah no I think that's a

414
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:41,519
a great tool it it's a little expensive

415
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:47,759
but if you are are putting out your

416
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:50,120
nematodes more evenly um more um alive

417
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:52,519
and more viable it's going to pay for

418
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:55,198
itself because I remember one of the

419
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:57,799
first n i mean first cannabis meetings I

420
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:59,679
went to I heard somebody talking about

421
00:16:57,799 --> 00:17:01,719
using beneficial nitot or fungus net

422
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:03,318
management I'm like yeah awesome and

423
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,798
they were talking about well but we

424
00:17:03,318 --> 00:17:08,399
struggle we can't get even distribution

425
00:17:05,798 --> 00:17:11,359
and we're using a ladle to Ladle them

426
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:14,160
out of a container I'm like why aren't

427
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:15,838
you using an injector with you know an

428
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,679
artion bucket and they didn't even know

429
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:20,159
what I was talking about um and this

430
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:23,199
this is why I think it's so important

431
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,279
for cannabis Growers to come to uh

432
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,720
traditional

433
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:29,319
Horticultural conferences and trados

434
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,919
because sometimes the problem you have

435
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:33,960
another industry is already solved it

436
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:36,000
and you can pick up on those tools so

437
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:38,400
again this this bucket that dram

438
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,640
designed was designed for you know the

439
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:43,720
floriculture industry but now I see more

440
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:46,520
cannabis scers using it too so it can

441
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:49,200
definitely uh cross over the markets but

442
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:50,279
the reason I was talking to Kurt if

443
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,720
we're do you have any questions about

444
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:54,639
the nimod bucket or I want to touch well

445
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,759
no I want to talk about SF neod so like

446
00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:00,759
for me the smallest amount I could order

447
00:17:56,759 --> 00:18:02,960
was quite large uh and that was fine um

448
00:18:00,759 --> 00:18:04,798
so I was just my goal with my

449
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,519
application I mixed it in a five gallon

450
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:08,279
bucket I was over applying it because I

451
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:12,079
only had like a couple yards of soil and

452
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:13,519
two 4x4 beds so it it wasn't a big deal

453
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:16,279
for me to over apply it so like for the

454
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:19,839
home grower could you just go over

455
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:23,200
like a a quick version of like what why

456
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:25,519
SF nematodes are so wonderful um how you

457
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,279
receive them apply them for someone

458
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:28,679
who's not going to get the Nemo bucket I

459
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:31,759
just think that would be a good just

460
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:35,679
review to have well um just so you know

461
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:38,200
on like the try nematode products the

462
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:41,919
reason why it doesn't come in small

463
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:44,919
small packages is because the viability

464
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:47,360
goes down you you need to have a certain

465
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:50,000
Mass to maintain temperature and the

466
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:53,119
right moisture and everything and when

467
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,079
BASF was testing this they basically

468
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:57,599
can't go much smaller without affecting

469
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:59,319
a viability so that's part of the issue

470
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:00,480
there and for storage where you can put

471
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:02,960
them in your fridge and have them for

472
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,798
several weeks you can find suppliers

473
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:07,200
that will sell them on very small

474
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:09,000
amounts on sponges and those sponges you

475
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,919
can take and literally ring out in a

476
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,519
watering can and walk around and if

477
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:15,000
you're doing house plants water them

478
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:17,480
that way or you can mix up in a 5 gallon

479
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,640
bucket but the challenge is is you got

480
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:21,599
to get them all stirred in and you got

481
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:23,840
to move real quick so that they don't

482
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:26,000
settle down you need that constant

483
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:27,879
agitation the number one way I see

484
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,720
people killing nematodes is they take

485
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:32,799
Nim out of the refrigerator and put them

486
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:36,319
in twoo warm of water you want to make

487
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:38,759
sure your nematode temperature and your

488
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:41,000
water uh temperature are pretty close I

489
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:45,200
mean not exactly close but you know be

490
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:47,119
within 10 15 degrees is uh kind of thing

491
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,440
because they're kind of like fish you

492
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:49,798
know when you bought your fish in the

493
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,279
bag you brought them home you don't dump

494
00:19:49,798 --> 00:19:54,558
them into your tank you let it float so

495
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:57,158
the water gets uh pretty close together

496
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:59,480
in the fish bag and your tank water so

497
00:19:57,159 --> 00:20:01,159
that you don't shock them so you can

498
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:03,038
actually take your nematodes out of the

499
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:04,400
fridge an hour or so before applying

500
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:05,240
them and let them kind of warm up to

501
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,759
room

502
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:09,400
temperature if depending on what your

503
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:13,839
tap water is like right now my kitchen

504
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:15,759
tap water is crazy cold um because of

505
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:17,319
it's being wintertime but I'll be in

506
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:19,200
Florida next week and there's no such

507
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:20,798
thing as cold tap water in Florida

508
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,798
everything's warm to hot that comes out

509
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:25,158
of your TAP so you have to look at your

510
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:26,879
water temperature how you're storing

511
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:29,720
them which should be you know around 40

512
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,600
41 degrees and then try to you know

513
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:33,240
either get your nematodes warmed up get

514
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:35,599
your water cooled down let your water

515
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:38,480
warm up and kind of get them you know

516
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:40,000
closer together uh for application but

517
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,279
the main thing is is you want to make

518
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,960
sure they don't settle out so you do get

519
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:46,839
an even application now if you're doing

520
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,360
like what you did or what I do at home

521
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:50,119
same thing you get this giant package of

522
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:52,959
nematodes and you need to treat a small

523
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:55,678
amount you're over applying them anyhow

524
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,720
so it's not as much of a a deal to make

525
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,360
sure that they're so evenly distributed

526
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:01,519
but when you you got to go treat large

527
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:02,798
acreage you've got to make sure that

528
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:06,720
everybody's you know getting their

529
00:21:02,798 --> 00:21:10,079
nematodes out there um and you know

530
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:12,319
they're very uh compatible with most

531
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:13,960
insecticides uh products even the

532
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:15,558
microbial products you can actually tank

533
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:18,159
mix them together the beneficial

534
00:21:15,558 --> 00:21:20,240
nematodes are actually once you get them

535
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:22,120
in the soil they're pretty hard to kill

536
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,038
but they're easy to kill in the package

537
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:27,879
and when applying

538
00:21:24,038 --> 00:21:28,720
them and what are all the the targets of

539
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,720
the

540
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,000
ASF

541
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:35,759
nematodes for the most part our industry

542
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,159
is using Flor culture cannabis

543
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:41,119
vegetables they're using them for fungus

544
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:44,120
naap management uh and they are also

545
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:47,239
using them for control of certain thrip

546
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:49,519
species not all thrip species but thrips

547
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:51,679
that pupate in the soil number one

548
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:54,480
Western Flower thrips uh you can

549
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:55,880
definitely get some onion thrips but be

550
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,798
aware you know there are other

551
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:02,360
beneficial nematodes carpo caps bacteria

552
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:06,278
4 those will also actually infect fungus

553
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:09,119
snats they will infect thrips um but the

554
00:22:06,278 --> 00:22:13,679
initial research has shown that the

555
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:16,839
felta works better for the fungus snats

556
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:18,798
and Western Flower thrips um where

557
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:21,399
bacteria 4 and carpac caps we use for

558
00:22:18,798 --> 00:22:23,720
other more agricultural

559
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:26,880
pests and we you tend to see Western

560
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:30,480
flowers the dominant thrip species in

561
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:34,440
cannabis no onion no I onion is the

562
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:38,440
predominant one um also see a Kyo thps

563
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:40,640
um less to or less extent um but I very

564
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:42,240
rarely rarely and personally I've still

565
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,400
never seen Western Flower thrips in

566
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:47,359
cannabis not to say it can exist but I I

567
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:49,000
have not seen it yet everything I've

568
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:51,479
seen all the samples I've looked at have

569
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,480
been onion

570
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:57,000
thrips um and can you talk a little bit

571
00:22:54,558 --> 00:22:58,759
about onion thrips uh life cycle while

572
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,440
we're at it I'm I'm this is more for my

573
00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:04,640
own edification again because I have I

574
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:07,880
guess I have thrips because I had I

575
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:11,440
spotted them on my young plants so I I

576
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:14,600
haven't found any real damage but I'm

577
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:16,558
I'm not going to say they're gone um

578
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:17,678
generally I'll tell you what I did first

579
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:19,079
and then you can tell me about the life

580
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,360
cycle to tell me if I addressed it

581
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:21,678
correctly that might be a good way to

582
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:23,278
approach this really quick before we go

583
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:25,720
on with the latest stuff

584
00:23:23,278 --> 00:23:28,000
so uh grower called me said hey the

585
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:29,759
Clones you gave you I found some thri

586
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,278
damage not a lot but you probably have

587
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:33,440
thrips so then I went back through my

588
00:23:31,278 --> 00:23:35,919
plants sure enough I found a couple

589
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,679
their hard to spot but I have I did not

590
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:39,080
get them identified by you other than I

591
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,320
knew that they were thrips I but I don't

592
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:45,639
know the species you're already probably

593
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:49,119
shaking your head um what no so uh I did

594
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:52,440
a couple applications of sufff oil x uh

595
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:54,239
in the form of montere horiculture oil

596
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:56,840
because I could pick that up locally or

597
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:59,599
on Amazon um in a small enough size it's

598
00:23:56,839 --> 00:24:01,158
the same product um I don't need a 5

599
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:04,079
gallon bucket of suff oil or a gallon of

600
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:06,240
suff oil so um I I did two applications

601
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:09,319
of that two to three days apart I

602
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:14,240
believe um and then I followed that up

603
00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:15,558
with a release of SF nematodes and um oh

604
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,960
here's where I got to go back and

605
00:24:15,558 --> 00:24:22,079
remember my list of um beneficial

606
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,960
insects because I always forget this one

607
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:26,519
strul about

608
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:28,600
insect no or cucumeris was it on the

609
00:24:26,519 --> 00:24:33,879
Fage or

610
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:38,480
sski on the foler I did a foler of sersi

611
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:39,840
okay um and that was those were my along

612
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,558
with the

613
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:44,439
nematodes and I think I might have also

614
00:24:42,558 --> 00:24:48,558
released some Rove beetles at the same

615
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:50,480
time but um yeah that was sort of my

616
00:24:48,558 --> 00:24:51,960
preventative approach towards dealing

617
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,079
with this issue and I haven't seen any

618
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,519
insects in the room I know I had some

619
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:57,079
fungus gnats at the time too and I

620
00:24:54,519 --> 00:24:59,679
haven't um I haven't had any uh fungus

621
00:24:57,079 --> 00:25:03,199
snats showing up on my sensor cards the

622
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:05,720
yellow sticky cards since the you know

623
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:08,120
it's been a month or so now month month

624
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:10,200
and a half at least since I did all this

625
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:11,398
but um how would you have approached it

626
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,759
I

627
00:25:11,398 --> 00:25:16,439
guess I would have identified what THS

628
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:19,640
it was but that's okay so was this was

629
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:23,519
this outside or is this like indoors

630
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:24,640
indoors indoors okay cuz and I think

631
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:26,319
most of the Growers we work with are

632
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,799
indoors that listen to the podcast so it

633
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:29,759
would be good let's just take this from

634
00:25:27,798 --> 00:25:31,839
an indoor perspective well I mean some

635
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:34,038
people you know will grow a few plants

636
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:35,959
and pots in their backyard you know kind

637
00:25:34,038 --> 00:25:38,960
of thing um but oh I've gotten them

638
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:41,319
outside too for sure outside is probably

639
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,720
a different species um especially when

640
00:25:41,319 --> 00:25:43,960
you go down to California outside they

641
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,880
have a completely different species in

642
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,759
cannabis outside but for what you were

643
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:50,200
dealing with I'm going to guess without

644
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:52,440
seeing it was probably onion thrips

645
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:55,798
onion thrips biology is very similar to

646
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:57,679
Western Flower the adult flies in female

647
00:25:55,798 --> 00:25:59,440
she inserts her egg into the planto

648
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:02,200
tissue it's in there a couple days it

649
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,798
hatches out starts cruising around they

650
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:06,038
have asymmetrical mouth Parts they kind

651
00:26:03,798 --> 00:26:08,879
of more I didn't to use the word grass

652
00:26:06,038 --> 00:26:12,759
but they kind of like damage the cell

653
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:16,559
surface there um and that's why you get

654
00:26:12,759 --> 00:26:17,640
that white silverish kind of color to

655
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:19,480
them because they're removing the

656
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:21,399
chlorophyll and if you look they're

657
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:24,519
through when they're in their early in

658
00:26:21,398 --> 00:26:26,959
Stars basically toddlers And even

659
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:28,759
teenagers they're they're kind of

660
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,679
yellowish clear but you can see the

661
00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:32,960
green chlorophyll from the plant in

662
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:35,159
their in their gut and you know they

663
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,798
poop it out this kind of greenish color

664
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:39,240
from the chlorophyll but they're going

665
00:26:36,798 --> 00:26:42,000
to cruise around and feed and this is

666
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:43,399
kind of and it it you know I always hate

667
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,720
to say things because people take it

668
00:26:43,398 --> 00:26:48,599
like oh my God that's it's black and

669
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:50,319
white but no it's not but generally

670
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:53,000
onion thrips tend to feed more on

671
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:55,519
foliage Western Flower thrips yes they

672
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,440
can feed on foliage but generally they

673
00:26:55,519 --> 00:27:01,079
are more of a flower problem because

674
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:03,440
they really like pollen and so Western

675
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:08,038
Flower thrips are what we see a lot in

676
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:10,240
pansies and we see um in patunas and we

677
00:27:08,038 --> 00:27:12,759
see um you know in lies because they

678
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,519
have a lot of pollen onion thrips tend

679
00:27:12,759 --> 00:27:16,759
to be more foliage

680
00:27:14,519 --> 00:27:18,798
feeder and so when you're growing

681
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:23,119
cannabis guess what you don't have

682
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:25,398
present pollen so um and and I think

683
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:27,918
people because they they don't do their

684
00:27:25,398 --> 00:27:29,519
due diligence and take the time to D

685
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:31,880
which I don't expect Growers to be able

686
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:34,480
to tell species of thrips apart you know

687
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:37,000
that's my job that's extensions jobs you

688
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:39,319
know people that that can do that stuff

689
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:42,720
um but people guess and they do the

690
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:45,519
matching photos online and you cannot

691
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,399
just match photos of Western Flower

692
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:48,759
thrips and onion thrips necessarily for

693
00:27:47,398 --> 00:27:50,798
ID from a distance you have to look at

694
00:27:48,759 --> 00:27:52,440
the length of the hair on the prot nooms

695
00:27:50,798 --> 00:27:53,879
you have to count in tenel segments you

696
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:57,558
really have to get in

697
00:27:53,880 --> 00:28:00,000
there but but but but the good thing is

698
00:27:57,558 --> 00:28:02,240
is generally for onion thrips and

699
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,159
Western Flower thrips the management is

700
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,759
basically the same because the biology

701
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:07,720
is the same you know they're they're

702
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:10,679
young they're eating on the plants then

703
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:13,600
they drop to the soil to pupate and then

704
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:15,200
the adults emerge back up where it gets

705
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:17,359
sticky is when you're dealing things

706
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:19,278
with like Ayo thrips who do not drop to

707
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:21,719
the soil to pupate it's also a much

708
00:28:19,278 --> 00:28:23,919
larger thrips the predatory mites can't

709
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:25,558
take out aino thrips so you generally

710
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:28,919
have to spray for aino thrips but when

711
00:28:25,558 --> 00:28:31,000
it comes to onion and Western flour

712
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:33,240
the the BIOS work really well the

713
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,558
predatory mites and all of that when it

714
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:37,679
gets into chemicals um Western Flower

715
00:28:35,558 --> 00:28:40,240
thrips have more resistance issues than

716
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:41,759
onion thrips um but that's not something

717
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,440
canos people necessarily have to worry

718
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:46,519
about because those kinds of pesticides

719
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,519
you're not going to be using

720
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:53,679
anyhow so how do you feel about the SF

721
00:28:49,798 --> 00:28:58,440
nematode sski approach following up you

722
00:28:53,679 --> 00:29:00,798
know a couple days after a a couple

723
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:05,159
suff oil applications so you can spray

724
00:29:00,798 --> 00:29:06,599
your critique my yeah so um suff oil is

725
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:07,840
fine once suff oil is dry you can

726
00:29:06,599 --> 00:29:09,398
re-release your predatory mites but if

727
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:11,000
you're going to do like you know two or

728
00:29:09,398 --> 00:29:12,759
three sprays of suffoil x two to three

729
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,919
days apart yes that's smart to wait to

730
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:17,960
release the predatory might from an

731
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:19,799
economic standpoint I generally go with

732
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:23,120
cucumeris more because it's a lot less

733
00:29:19,798 --> 00:29:27,079
expensive and it works just as well um

734
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:29,879
in cannabis on the thrips as sworski

735
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:34,240
does sski tends to be you know a little

736
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:36,120
more expensive um so but no I think

737
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,558
that's that's a perfectly fine program

738
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:40,918
and using you know your sticky cards uh

739
00:29:38,558 --> 00:29:44,639
you know to monitor I think is a very

740
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:46,278
you know good good tool for that so yeah

741
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,840
I'll give you I'll give you a that so

742
00:29:46,278 --> 00:29:48,798
one thing you mentioned was how they eat

743
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:52,240
the

744
00:29:48,798 --> 00:29:54,839
chlorophyll so one of the ways I just

745
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,919
Scouting For thrips when you see that

746
00:29:54,839 --> 00:29:59,319
like I always called it like the shiny

747
00:29:56,919 --> 00:30:01,159
leaf surface yeah is how I see it like

748
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:04,240
it just has a different gloss to the

749
00:30:01,159 --> 00:30:07,278
leaf where the damage is is that unique

750
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:09,159
to thrips because I to me thri damage

751
00:30:07,278 --> 00:30:10,599
looks very specific compared to other

752
00:30:09,159 --> 00:30:14,120
things and one of the things I look for

753
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:16,798
is that shininess we damages lace bugs

754
00:30:14,119 --> 00:30:18,918
can give you that kind of look too um

755
00:30:16,798 --> 00:30:21,278
now lace bugs aren't a big problem in

756
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:24,240
cannabis but it has lace bugs have been

757
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:27,359
reported in cannabis but it's not a huge

758
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:32,480
economic issue I mean it's hard to ever

759
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:34,398
say always but generally also um you

760
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,720
know spidermite damage sometimes can

761
00:30:34,398 --> 00:30:38,000
look a little similar um but they don't

762
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:41,038
have

763
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:44,079
that silverness but I don't always see

764
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:45,398
that silverness with thrips damage but

765
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:47,519
you do see it sometimes that's good to

766
00:30:45,398 --> 00:30:50,398
know that's good that's a good piece of

767
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:51,519
advice okay all right well I totally

768
00:30:50,398 --> 00:30:52,759
interrupted you as you were going

769
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:55,038
through some of the latest and greatest

770
00:30:52,759 --> 00:30:58,759
stuff on a tangent on thrips but I

771
00:30:55,038 --> 00:31:00,798
really enjoyed that um what

772
00:30:58,759 --> 00:31:03,798
um what else did you want to share in

773
00:31:00,798 --> 00:31:05,119
the last uh year that you've been well

774
00:31:03,798 --> 00:31:06,720
what I was going to say because we were

775
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:08,158
talking about the drram bucket Kurt

776
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,798
Becker I had a conversation with Kurt

777
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:14,519
Becker so for the cultivate show this

778
00:31:10,798 --> 00:31:16,440
July in Columbus Ohio amazing show it's

779
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:17,798
it's it's awesome the education

780
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:21,519
everything and someday Tad we're going

781
00:31:17,798 --> 00:31:24,038
to get you there um I'm teaching a a

782
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:26,079
full day workshop on the Saturday before

783
00:31:24,038 --> 00:31:29,158
the show starts and one of the things

784
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:30,960
we're doing talking about equipment is

785
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:34,278
I'm going to have dram come talk about

786
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:36,679
their Foggers because more and more

787
00:31:34,278 --> 00:31:38,720
people are looking at Pulse Foggers cold

788
00:31:36,679 --> 00:31:41,600
Foggers and things like that so that

789
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:43,319
they can apply for for ornamental

790
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:45,319
Growers conventional pesticides but also

791
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:47,879
microbials things like Bavaria things

792
00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:50,879
like Corps things like meisum where you

793
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:53,080
can put it in there close the door have

794
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:55,000
the timer kick on and basically air

795
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:56,720
quote fog your facility with these

796
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:00,240
microbial products so you don't have to

797
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,839
worry about Reis you don't have to worry

798
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,759
about you know you doing the spray

799
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:06,759
coverage and all of that and dram is

800
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:09,200
going to come and talk about and show

801
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:11,038
the equipment and we're going to show

802
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,798
about how they do the efficacy testing

803
00:32:11,038 --> 00:32:14,398
for microbials going through these

804
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:15,918
things and I I think it's going to be a

805
00:32:14,398 --> 00:32:18,158
really that's just going to be a part of

806
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:19,880
the day there's a whole bunch of stuff

807
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:23,480
we're we're going to be doing we're

808
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:25,320
going to um be talking about some other

809
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:26,599
other products I'm about to talk to you

810
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:29,879
about we're going to be demonstrating

811
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:32,119
how how to use them um and I'm going to

812
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:35,919
be doing some more how how

813
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:38,678
to basically kind of take cuting off of

814
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:40,559
plants washing plant cuting and how to

815
00:32:38,679 --> 00:32:41,480
find pest in them for early detection so

816
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:43,638
we're going to have a bunch of good

817
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:45,919
stuff at uh cultivate this

818
00:32:43,638 --> 00:32:48,558
July all right I have one dumb question

819
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:51,080
then before you move on um so as someone

820
00:32:48,558 --> 00:32:52,960
who is like very conscious of my health

821
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:56,519
probably have too much anxiety around it

822
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:58,919
in general uh one thing I think about

823
00:32:56,519 --> 00:33:00,798
with our eyes when I go to visit

824
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:02,679
facilities and some facilities are great

825
00:33:00,798 --> 00:33:06,359
about it and some are not as I'm sure

826
00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:07,720
you've seen um in terms of pp or like

827
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:10,918
hey let me show you this room and I

828
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:12,759
don't know when they last sprayed um I

829
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:14,480
get a little nervous about that but if

830
00:33:12,759 --> 00:33:15,720
if you were to use like let's just say

831
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,240
as a hypothetical you were to use a

832
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:19,480
fogger to spray a microbial um I don't

833
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:23,038
really want to be breathing that in my

834
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:25,519
lungs um how you know with no REI does

835
00:33:23,038 --> 00:33:27,720
that just does that just settle so

836
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:30,798
rapidly that you can go back into a room

837
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:32,558
relatively soon it will have an REI but

838
00:33:30,798 --> 00:33:35,558
what happens is they set these to go off

839
00:33:32,558 --> 00:33:40,678
when nobody's working so it will fog and

840
00:33:35,558 --> 00:33:43,000
then while your REI is why nobody is at

841
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:45,559
work okay but let's just say they're not

842
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,398
doing it that way because I'm sure that

843
00:33:45,558 --> 00:33:48,960
is the case in more facilities than you

844
00:33:47,398 --> 00:33:52,719
realize so let's assume that they let

845
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:55,519
off a you know they set off the fogger

846
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:57,480
in the middle of the afternoon um how

847
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:59,038
long does it take for those particles to

848
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:01,558
settle back down to where you're not

849
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:03,319
breathing the product particle size and

850
00:34:01,558 --> 00:34:04,798
how much venting you have cuz there all

851
00:34:03,319 --> 00:34:08,358
these venting rules that go along to

852
00:34:04,798 --> 00:34:09,918
it's a very variable thing um but if

853
00:34:08,358 --> 00:34:11,199
you're just going through there one time

854
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:13,799
probably not going to kill you if you

855
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:15,078
work there probably over time not a

856
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:18,679
great thing because breathing in

857
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:20,440
anything I mean it's just like you know

858
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:22,320
breathing in anything to your lungs is

859
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:24,280
not good even if it's something that

860
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,720
could be

861
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:28,119
benign yeah I'm not I'm not worried that

862
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:29,398
like the microbes are going to like the

863
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:30,800
bacteria is going to start growing in my

864
00:34:29,398 --> 00:34:32,960
lungs necessarily anything like I know

865
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:35,639
we breede these things all the time in

866
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:37,240
yeah much much lower concentrations but

867
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:40,480
I feel like just getting anything in

868
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:42,598
your lungs isn't healthy so it just it

869
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:45,000
just concerns me sometimes when I don't

870
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:47,720
know the grow quite as well that I'm

871
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,878
visiting um well and that's why and

872
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:51,358
stuff you should also carry gloves with

873
00:34:49,878 --> 00:34:55,159
you because you don't know what's been

874
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:57,480
sprayed on those plants um but I mean by

875
00:34:55,159 --> 00:35:01,480
law they have to label you know what was

876
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:04,159
in sprayed and the time and in theory

877
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:05,760
that's what they should be doing um so

878
00:35:04,159 --> 00:35:09,598
that people to go in now here's the

879
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:12,880
crazy thing the REI applies to their

880
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:12,880
employees not

881
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:19,519
you so there's no legal REI for someone

882
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:22,440
randomly walking into a room is what

883
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:25,199
you're saying versus okay an employee oh

884
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:29,599
that's that's interesting I

885
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:31,000
guess scary but interesting um okay so

886
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:33,039
as a general rule for people who are

887
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,838
listening to the podcast just make sure

888
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:37,920
you're following all the instructions on

889
00:35:34,838 --> 00:35:39,480
whatever product you're applying and uh

890
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,200
yeah just be careful out there I it's

891
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:44,119
something I I just read about uh I just

892
00:35:42,199 --> 00:35:47,598
heard a thing about a a new confirmed

893
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:50,960
death actually in cannabis um relating

894
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:53,119
to a girl who was working in a cannabis

895
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:57,199
facility and developed essentially

896
00:35:53,119 --> 00:36:00,519
anaphylaxis from um the the turpine in

897
00:35:57,199 --> 00:36:01,838
the Cannabis uh an allergist posted

898
00:36:00,519 --> 00:36:03,838
about this and it was a confirmed

899
00:36:01,838 --> 00:36:06,759
documented case where she developed an

900
00:36:03,838 --> 00:36:08,599
allergic reaction to the plant itself

901
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:11,880
and in being working in areas that were

902
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:14,519
poorly ventilated she eventually

903
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:17,400
um went into anaphylactic shot and

904
00:36:14,519 --> 00:36:19,358
passed away sadly

905
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:21,440
so I don't know because sometimes when I

906
00:36:19,358 --> 00:36:24,159
go in these rooms I do it it is almost

907
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:26,318
overwhelming the uh the smell and I'm

908
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:28,519
allergic to everything myself so uh it's

909
00:36:26,318 --> 00:36:30,838
something just really sensitive too but

910
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:33,440
we're getting off topic yeah no well and

911
00:36:30,838 --> 00:36:34,838
and as Wendy cornberg will tell you that

912
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,800
she she tells me I'm allergic to

913
00:36:34,838 --> 00:36:38,719
Butterfly farts because I am so

914
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,440
sensitive to everything and I have the

915
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:42,279
same problem Sometimes some of the

916
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:44,280
cannab facilities it's it's quite

917
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:47,119
overwhelming and I will say it's not

918
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:50,599
just cannabis I mean if you ever go into

919
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:53,480
a field of like five acres of gardinas

920
00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:56,000
in full bloom it it it's almost hard to

921
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:58,318
breathe because it's just those plant

922
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,559
volatiles can be so overwhelming and if

923
00:36:58,318 --> 00:37:02,239
you're smelling them you know it's it's

924
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:05,880
coming off the plant and it it is going

925
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:07,078
into your lungs and it it can be kind of

926
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:10,039
sensitive so just you just have to be

927
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:12,440
smart about it um and and and don't be

928
00:37:10,039 --> 00:37:15,119
afraid to say something I I will say I

929
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:17,280
was at a um a floriculture facility one

930
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:18,720
time many years ago and they wanted us

931
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:21,040
to go through that and I looked across

932
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:22,799
the greenhouse and they were spraying

933
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:25,199
pesticides while we were in there and

934
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:27,400
I'm like what and then this poor little

935
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:28,960
bee flew past me and literally fell on

936
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:31,240
the ground and died in front of me and

937
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:34,318
I'm like we need to leave right now

938
00:37:31,239 --> 00:37:36,159
because we should not be in here and so

939
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:38,159
I think sometimes Growers because

940
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:41,239
they're so used to being around it to

941
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:43,318
get desensitized to it and especially if

942
00:37:41,239 --> 00:37:44,959
you don't know anybody that's had

943
00:37:43,318 --> 00:37:47,440
pesticide poisoning or something you

944
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:50,960
don't think about it as much but your

945
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:54,679
health is not worth not saying something

946
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:56,400
air on the side of caution always um

947
00:37:54,679 --> 00:37:57,919
because you only get one body and you

948
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,280
need need you know you need to take care

949
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:02,920
of it um but don't be scared don't be

950
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:05,560
afraid to say something um and the label

951
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:08,200
is the law you must follow those labels

952
00:38:05,559 --> 00:38:09,440
and if you don't think the EPA will

953
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:11,078
catch up with you eventually or your

954
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,599
state Regulators if you're doing

955
00:38:11,079 --> 00:38:14,800
something legal they will eventually

956
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:17,119
catch up to

957
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,560
you yeah and on the note of the label

958
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:20,440
one thing that Eve taught me is It's

959
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:23,199
always important to spray at the label

960
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:25,119
rates because if you underpray the pest

961
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:26,838
May survive and develop a resistance to

962
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:28,960
it and so you may be creating a fur

963
00:38:26,838 --> 00:38:30,759
problem so always important to fall to

964
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,760
spray at full strength or whatever the

965
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:34,040
label says yeah cuz people think I'm

966
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:37,319
going to be environmental I'm not going

967
00:38:34,039 --> 00:38:39,279
to use as much but it just sets you up

968
00:38:37,318 --> 00:38:41,079
for failure there's a reason why

969
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:44,160
products have labeled rate it's because

970
00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:45,599
the research has been done to show that

971
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:47,719
is like where you're going to get the

972
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:50,318
most efficacy but still safe for the

973
00:38:47,719 --> 00:38:52,078
plants and you know there's that's why

974
00:38:50,318 --> 00:38:53,400
it takes so long to bring products to

975
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:55,680
Market these days because you have to

976
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:57,160
have so much scientific information to

977
00:38:55,679 --> 00:38:59,480
back all this up

978
00:38:57,159 --> 00:39:02,000

you've uh you've been excited about so I

983
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:15,679
have these here uh catch

984
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:17,800
Masters has come out with a new sticky

985
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:21,879
card shape now if I can get it out of

986
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:24,680
the box um they are doing and I'm super

987
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:27,880
excited about these especially for uh

988
00:39:24,679 --> 00:39:30,039
smaller gardeners um

989
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:31,640
smaller production and I'm excited to

990
00:39:30,039 --> 00:39:34,880
have these for my house because yes

991
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:38,318
Suzanne gets fungus snats too they

992
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:40,720
are preut because I had so many Growers

993
00:39:38,318 --> 00:39:43,599
cutting sticky cards to make small ones

994
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:45,480
for monitoring um when you don't need a

995
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:47,119
full-size sticky card and it's got a

996
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:50,199
pointy tip so you can stick it right in

997
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:54,119
the soil peel it off you can write on

998
00:39:50,199 --> 00:39:57,759
these the information and Away you go

999
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:59,720
I'm they um they never told me about

1000
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:02,560
that I will reach out to Alex about that

1001
00:39:59,719 --> 00:40:06,239
here after the call so um because we do

1002
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:08,880
sell catchmaster sticky cards um those

1003
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:10,879
these are the shape of a plant marker or

1004
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,160
a pot stick it depends on what you you

1005
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,559
know them as but that's what she's

1006
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:15,960
holding up right now for those of you

1007
00:40:13,559 --> 00:40:17,639
that are listening to the podcast yeah

1008
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:19,960
sorry

1009
00:40:17,639 --> 00:40:22,118
and yeah I was going to add one side has

1010
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:23,720
adhesive on it so that you can peel it

1011
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:25,200
so it looks like one side is sticky and

1012
00:40:23,719 --> 00:40:28,118
then the other side you can write on is

1013
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:29,679
that right yep very cool that is

1014
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:33,720
exciting for

1015
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:36,519
propagation um for homeowners for

1016
00:40:33,719 --> 00:40:39,358
interior scapers um I'm I'm really

1017
00:40:36,519 --> 00:40:40,800
excited about these um um I'm actually

1018
00:40:39,358 --> 00:40:42,679
they're going to be at the show in

1019
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:45,119
Florida next week and so we'll be

1020
00:40:42,679 --> 00:40:46,879
talking about these down there um I'm

1021
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:49,079
excited about these because again so

1022
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:52,039
many of my even large Growers were

1023
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:54,280
cutting the cards and then you're nobody

1024
00:40:52,039 --> 00:40:55,960
wants to sit and cut sticky cards trust

1025
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:59,560
me and your scissors get all gross with

1026
00:40:55,960 --> 00:41:02,199
the goo and so yeah that's something I'm

1027
00:40:59,559 --> 00:41:04,519
excited about too two things I want to

1028
00:41:02,199 --> 00:41:05,639
add to that about sticky cards um one

1029
00:41:04,519 --> 00:41:07,639
what you should be writing on the back

1030
00:41:05,639 --> 00:41:09,480
is the date so you can keep track of how

1031
00:41:07,639 --> 00:41:12,279
long that card's been in there or that

1032
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:14,559
pot stick uh and then two one thing I

1033
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:16,119
found with the catch Master cards is the

1034
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:17,400
whatever adhesive that they're using

1035
00:41:16,119 --> 00:41:19,559
because I've I've actually talked to

1036
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:21,920
their uh head guys about that and I want

1037
00:41:19,559 --> 00:41:24,318
to do a little not a podcast but maybe a

1038
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,800
shorter little snippet with them to put

1039
00:41:24,318 --> 00:41:30,440
up on uh social media but

1040
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:32,359
uh the glue on it is is it's not as

1041
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:34,599
sticky it's much easier for me to get

1042
00:41:32,358 --> 00:41:35,759
their sticky card glue off of my hands

1043
00:41:34,599 --> 00:41:37,680
when I touch it or it doesn't

1044
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,400
necessarily come off on my hands

1045
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:42,078
compared to what I remember from a

1046
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:43,800
sticky card like 15 20 years ago where

1047
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:45,280
like if you so much looked at that thing

1048
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:47,359
like your hands were going to be gross

1049
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:49,359
for a while do you know what I'm talking

1050
00:41:47,358 --> 00:41:51,358
about so there's different kinds of

1051
00:41:49,358 --> 00:41:53,759
sticky cards these are called dry sticky

1052
00:41:51,358 --> 00:41:57,239
cards and they're designed for catching

1053
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:59,760
things like thrips and um whiteflies

1054
00:41:57,239 --> 00:42:01,358
smaller insects what I have seen sold at

1055
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,480
a lot of the grow stores and the

1056
00:42:01,358 --> 00:42:05,598
Cannabis industry I've been using are

1057
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:08,000
they're for catching larger insects and

1058
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:09,800
they have a heavier glue to them because

1059
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,079
the thickness of the glue depends on the

1060
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:14,160
size of insect you need to trap if you

1061
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:16,800
saw um you guys don't have it on the

1062
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:19,279
West Coast but Emerald ashor which is

1063
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:21,079
torn through the East Coast um they put

1064
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,800
these giant purple traps but has really

1065
00:42:21,079 --> 00:42:24,519
thick glue on it because those beetles

1066
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:27,960
are like 3/4 of an inch so you need a

1067
00:42:24,519 --> 00:42:29,920
lot of glue so you get different levels

1068
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:33,000
of glue depending on what you're

1069
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:34,440
targeting and trying to do and the idea

1070
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,719
with these is if you put your hand on

1071
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:38,720
and peel off you really don't get your

1072
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:40,399
hand stuck to them I will say if you

1073
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:42,439
have a sticky card on your desk and you

1074
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,920
lean down and put your head on it it

1075
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:47,559
will stick to your hair done that a few

1076
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:52,680
times um but these are designed for

1077
00:42:47,559 --> 00:42:54,640
trapping small insects not big ones um

1078
00:42:52,679 --> 00:42:56,759
if you do ever get the sticky on your

1079
00:42:54,639 --> 00:42:58,719
hand just vegetable oil would take it

1080
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:00,640
right off your

1081
00:42:58,719 --> 00:43:02,439
hands that's great I didn't know about

1082
00:43:00,639 --> 00:43:03,960
the glue thing but that makes sense um

1083
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:06,159
I've been using the catchmaster cards

1084
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:07,760
now in my garden and like I said they're

1085
00:43:06,159 --> 00:43:09,799
a little tacky when you end up touching

1086
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,960
it but it doesn't stay on your fingers I

1087
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:12,760
don't feel like I have to go wash my

1088
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:14,440
hands immediately or like my hands my

1089
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:16,880
skin stuck together so that is really

1090
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:19,639
nice yeah it kind of got sold on their

1091
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:21,760
cards when I I wanted to do like a a

1092
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:24,400
photo shoot of people putting out cards

1093
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:25,720
and I I used catch meas cards and the

1094
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,559
grower hung it up and we were standing

1095
00:43:25,719 --> 00:43:31,759
there talking and I literally was

1096
00:43:27,559 --> 00:43:33,680
watching thrips fly into the cards um

1097
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:35,359
and don't get caught up in this idea

1098
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:37,598
that you need to have blue cards if

1099
00:43:35,358 --> 00:43:39,679
you'll read that online um a friend of

1100
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:42,119
mine Sarah Jan drisk in Canada has done

1101
00:43:39,679 --> 00:43:44,519
some research showing yellow works just

1102
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:46,640
as well and if not better for trapping

1103
00:43:44,519 --> 00:43:48,159
thrips the the yellow over the blue so

1104
00:43:46,639 --> 00:43:50,719
don't spend the extra money on the blue

1105
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:53,358
the yellow work perfectly

1106
00:43:50,719 --> 00:43:56,879
fine how so should we be using blue

1107
00:43:53,358 --> 00:43:59,000
cards at all in your opinion

1108
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:02,599
it depends on the situation sometimes if

1109
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:05,639
people are releasing high levels of

1110
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:08,400
parasitoids they may move to blue

1111
00:44:05,639 --> 00:44:10,639
because the parasitoids seem to go to

1112
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,800
the yellow more than the blue but

1113
00:44:10,639 --> 00:44:13,199
generally people are putting out high

1114
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:18,800
levels of parasitoids they take their

1115
00:44:13,199 --> 00:44:20,399
sticky cards down so um that for for

1116
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:25,359
what you're doing in cannabis generally

1117
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:27,318
I would I would think no so um but I we

1118
00:44:25,358 --> 00:44:29,400
talked about this never don't I want to

1119
00:44:27,318 --> 00:44:30,679
say never but generally no for the most

1120
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:32,519
part you don't need them unless it's a

1121
00:44:30,679 --> 00:44:34,358
special

1122
00:44:32,519 --> 00:44:37,159
circumstance okay and then what about

1123
00:44:34,358 --> 00:44:39,480
the mass trapping uh

1124
00:44:37,159 --> 00:44:41,598
roles those are great if if you're

1125
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:43,440
having massive white fly issues if

1126
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:46,240
you're having massive thrips especially

1127
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:49,480
flying thrips this is we do this more

1128
00:44:46,239 --> 00:44:51,598
with vented green houses or green houses

1129
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:54,358
that open their sidewalls and we have

1130
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:56,318
massive influx from outside and we have

1131
00:44:54,358 --> 00:45:00,880
these massive sticky rolls to do m M

1132
00:44:56,318 --> 00:45:05,440
trapping um I have never an indoor

1133
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:08,800
indoor cannabis seen thrips numbers so

1134
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:11,318
through the roof that you would need the

1135
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:12,960
the mass trapping rolls necessarily I

1136
00:45:11,318 --> 00:45:15,279
mean it's not going to hurt to have them

1137
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:16,880
up um but what I have seen is because

1138
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:18,720
you know cannabis Growers love releasing

1139
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:20,160
ladybird beetles and I've seen numerous

1140
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:22,759
times they have those massive yellow

1141
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:24,598
rolls out they dump out the ladybugs and

1142
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:27,319
then the ladybugs just all get stuck on

1143
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:29,359
those big yellow rolls

1144
00:45:27,318 --> 00:45:31,880
and just a friendly reminder to folks

1145
00:45:29,358 --> 00:45:34,159
we're not buying ladybugs because they

1146
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:36,200
are wild harvested they can bring in

1147
00:45:34,159 --> 00:45:37,879
diseases and there's just much better

1148
00:45:36,199 --> 00:45:39,399
options though they do look cool and

1149
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:41,519
they seem to have become the face of B

1150
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:43,880
controls that they really shouldn't be

1151
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:47,079
right by the way K my friend Kim Horton

1152
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:50,358
who you've met um she was out hiking in

1153
00:45:47,079 --> 00:45:53,880
California and she came across a huge

1154
00:45:50,358 --> 00:45:56,078
mass of over wintering ladybird beetles

1155
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:58,599
and she sent me pictures I am so so

1156
00:45:56,079 --> 00:46:01,280
jealous that's on my bucket list is to

1157
00:45:58,599 --> 00:46:03,519
see the overwintering sites in

1158
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:05,440
California for where you have millions

1159
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:07,759
of these ladybird beetles all clustering

1160
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,960
together yeah can you paint the scene

1161
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:10,319
here because I don't even know what that

1162
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:12,440
would look like other than I know that

1163
00:46:10,318 --> 00:46:15,119
they're that's how they're harvested but

1164
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:16,720
well is it is it literally like a giant

1165
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:20,200
they're just they they cover the ground

1166
00:46:16,719 --> 00:46:21,679
they cover the the trunks of the trees

1167
00:46:20,199 --> 00:46:24,799
sometimes they'll you know get into

1168
00:46:21,679 --> 00:46:27,279
crevices and rocks so on the East

1169
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:29,440
Coast bunch of our ladyb Birds here over

1170
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:31,720
winter under and leaf litter so you

1171
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:33,679
don't necessarily see them these are

1172
00:46:31,719 --> 00:46:36,000
these are more vertical overwintering

1173
00:46:33,679 --> 00:46:37,318
sites in California I I'll share the

1174
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,599
pictures with

1175
00:46:37,318 --> 00:46:42,000
you that's cool that's cool yeah um

1176
00:46:40,599 --> 00:46:43,200
getting back to the mass trapping thing

1177
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,400
I just want to touch on so a lot of

1178
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:47,078
times what I see is people are mass

1179
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:48,720
trapping for fungus Nets but really

1180
00:46:47,079 --> 00:46:51,559
maybe that money would be much better

1181
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:55,239
spent then on like SF nematodes as an

1182
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:56,760
approach or bti or something else rather

1183
00:46:55,239 --> 00:46:58,639
than

1184
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:59,839
trying to catch the adults I mean it

1185
00:46:58,639 --> 00:47:01,078
depends on how they're Mass trapping

1186
00:46:59,838 --> 00:47:02,759
because remember fungus Nets gener are

1187
00:47:01,079 --> 00:47:04,680
going to be low down near the soil and

1188
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:06,680
if you've got your sticky ribbon way up

1189
00:47:04,679 --> 00:47:08,879
high you're not going to get many up

1190
00:47:06,679 --> 00:47:11,519
there up high is you're getting more of

1191
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:13,119
the flying in white flies flying in thps

1192
00:47:11,519 --> 00:47:15,159
if you were going to do I would say Mass

1193
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:17,039
trapping for fungus Nets I would use the

1194
00:47:15,159 --> 00:47:19,440
traditional Square sticky cards down on

1195
00:47:17,039 --> 00:47:21,159
the soil surface like a billboard

1196
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:24,720
because you want it low where the fungus

1197
00:47:21,159 --> 00:47:27,199
Nets are hanging out not way up

1198
00:47:24,719 --> 00:47:29,279
high could you run a strip along the

1199
00:47:27,199 --> 00:47:31,639
edge of the facility though for example

1200
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:32,599
lower down closer to the soil May okay

1201
00:47:31,639 --> 00:47:34,879
all right

1202
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:37,559
cool all right moving

1203
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:42,680
on all right um okay we just did the

1204
00:47:37,559 --> 00:47:44,839
sticky guards um so lace Wings love lace

1205
00:47:42,679 --> 00:47:47,598
Wings in cannabis they've been super

1206
00:47:44,838 --> 00:47:50,318
helpful you know lacewing larvae we know

1207
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:53,359
will feed on aphids um they'll snack on

1208
00:47:50,318 --> 00:47:55,838
spider mites um they'll definitely feed

1209
00:47:53,358 --> 00:47:56,880
on some some percentage of thrifts

1210
00:47:55,838 --> 00:47:58,759
they're not what you go to for the rips

1211
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:00,680
but they're a good generous Predator the

1212
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:03,079
problem we've had is

1213
00:48:00,679 --> 00:48:04,639
application um because you generally buy

1214
00:48:03,079 --> 00:48:05,960
eggs or you buy the larvae how do you

1215
00:48:04,639 --> 00:48:07,759
get them out on the plants where you can

1216
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:09,318
buy those lacewing egg cards that you

1217
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:11,800
rip and tear and hang which I do love

1218
00:48:09,318 --> 00:48:14,119
for cannabis but if your plants are well

1219
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:16,559
spaced trying to rip all those and put

1220
00:48:14,119 --> 00:48:19,400
them around sometimes can be challenging

1221
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:24,440
there is a new product called egg jent

1222
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:27,838
um copert is selling it if you buy the

1223
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:31,240
eggs from them but if you read the label

1224
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:33,239
um it's xantham gum and basically what

1225
00:48:31,239 --> 00:48:35,679
you can do is you can use a PumpUp

1226
00:48:33,239 --> 00:48:39,318
sprayer or a backpack sprayer you take

1227
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:42,358
the filters out you put water in you put

1228
00:48:39,318 --> 00:48:45,079
your xantham gum egant in and then you

1229
00:48:42,358 --> 00:48:46,440
add the lacewing eggs stir well you stir

1230
00:48:45,079 --> 00:48:47,839
up the xantham gum first get that

1231
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:51,039
dissolved then you put the lacewing eggs

1232
00:48:47,838 --> 00:48:53,159
in and you literally can spray it on

1233
00:48:51,039 --> 00:48:56,239
your plants and the lacewing eggs will

1234
00:48:53,159 --> 00:48:58,960
stick to the plant leaves

1235
00:48:56,239 --> 00:49:00,639
and then they'll hatch in about two days

1236
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:03,318
and then they can go walking off across

1237
00:49:00,639 --> 00:49:04,960
the plant so you can spray out a lot of

1238
00:49:03,318 --> 00:49:07,318
lace swing eggs getting really good

1239
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:10,159
coverage on a lot of the crop pretty

1240
00:49:07,318 --> 00:49:13,039
fast and it's a pretty economical way to

1241
00:49:10,159 --> 00:49:15,279
do this we did tests in the fall on PO

1242
00:49:13,039 --> 00:49:17,039
cetas to see if it left any kind of

1243
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:19,559
residue or discoloration on the plant

1244
00:49:17,039 --> 00:49:22,199
and it doesn't and sanm gum is you know

1245
00:49:19,559 --> 00:49:23,720
something we eat it's it's a it's a food

1246
00:49:22,199 --> 00:49:26,239
not well you don't just eat streets it's

1247
00:49:23,719 --> 00:49:27,639
anthm gum but it's a gumming agent so

1248
00:49:26,239 --> 00:49:28,959
it's not like you're spraying a

1249
00:49:27,639 --> 00:49:31,639
pesticide you're spraying you know a

1250
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:34,079
food grade something on your

1251
00:49:31,639 --> 00:49:38,159
plants can can since you brought up Lace

1252
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:42,000
Wings can you touch on uh what instances

1253
00:49:38,159 --> 00:49:46,239
you might use them in cannabis and um

1254
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:50,519
what uh what their their target pests

1255
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:52,279
are so number one aphids number two just

1256
00:49:50,519 --> 00:49:54,519
generally any soft bodied insects that

1257
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:57,920
definitely feed on two spot spider mites

1258
00:49:54,519 --> 00:50:00,119
they um will definitely feed on thrips I

1259
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:01,798
mean there's some work that's been done

1260
00:50:00,119 --> 00:50:03,519
looking at them for Ayo thrips but they

1261
00:50:01,798 --> 00:50:05,159
will definitely snack on thrips if they

1262
00:50:03,519 --> 00:50:08,000
find them on the plant I I just think

1263
00:50:05,159 --> 00:50:10,118
they're a good cheap insurance policy to

1264
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,480
put into a lot of crops because they'll

1265
00:50:10,119 --> 00:50:16,760
feed on just about anything if they find

1266
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:20,318
it um and they're inexpensive to use um

1267
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:22,319
and there's plenty of supply of lace

1268
00:50:20,318 --> 00:50:26,318
Wings here it's not something that they

1269
00:50:22,318 --> 00:50:27,920
have shortages of and it's hard to get

1270
00:50:26,318 --> 00:50:29,798
so is this something you would sort of

1271
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:32,838
tack on if you were already ordering

1272
00:50:29,798 --> 00:50:35,199
beneficials it's just kind of an added

1273
00:50:32,838 --> 00:50:36,679
what I it depends on attacker yeah well

1274
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:39,318
it depends you know every program

1275
00:50:36,679 --> 00:50:41,159
depends but if you had well spaced

1276
00:50:39,318 --> 00:50:44,400
cannabis plants where there's not

1277
00:50:41,159 --> 00:50:47,759
bridging between the foliage where you

1278
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:49,079
know you you could put lace Wing larvae

1279
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:50,720
on one plant and they're going to move

1280
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:52,720
to the other plants through the canopy

1281
00:50:50,719 --> 00:50:54,318
of the plant if you have them spaced and

1282
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:56,798
if you have a lot of area to cover

1283
00:50:54,318 --> 00:50:58,639
because again you know if you've got

1284
00:50:56,798 --> 00:51:00,679
5,000 plants you're not going to be able

1285
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:02,118
to go out and hang egg cards on every

1286
00:51:00,679 --> 00:51:03,558
plant this is a way you can mix them up

1287
00:51:02,119 --> 00:51:05,559
and just go out and spray them over top

1288
00:51:03,559 --> 00:51:08,079
and you're

1289
00:51:05,559 --> 00:51:09,720
done this is not something for small

1290
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:11,599
production this is something that's

1291
00:51:09,719 --> 00:51:15,239
going to get you a lot of lace Wings

1292
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:16,559
eggs out fast and an economical way of

1293
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:18,838
doing

1294
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:20,839
it yeah I guess a better way to phrase

1295
00:51:18,838 --> 00:51:22,599
my question is for since the majority of

1296
00:51:20,838 --> 00:51:24,960
people listen there probably aren't you

1297
00:51:22,599 --> 00:51:27,960
know super large scale Growers when and

1298
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:30,358
how would they want to use lace Wings if

1299
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:32,720
well for them you if you're a smaller

1300
00:51:30,358 --> 00:51:34,440
scale home hobby um you know I would go

1301
00:51:32,719 --> 00:51:37,239
with the egg cards and then just try to

1302
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:38,838
have your plants touching the egg cards

1303
00:51:37,239 --> 00:51:40,239
are little strips of cardboard with a

1304
00:51:38,838 --> 00:51:42,239
hanger on them and they have lacewing

1305
00:51:40,239 --> 00:51:44,558
eggs glued on there that you just walk

1306
00:51:42,239 --> 00:51:46,118
along and you can hang on the plants and

1307
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:47,519
then when those eggs hatch they walk off

1308
00:51:46,119 --> 00:51:49,200
the card and then they go up into the

1309
00:51:47,519 --> 00:51:51,119
can to be the plant but you're going to

1310
00:51:49,199 --> 00:51:53,399
have a concentration of lace Wings

1311
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:55,480
wherever you put those egg cards which

1312
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:57,240
may be okay because if if you really

1313
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:59,798
want to concentrated it in a place you

1314
00:51:57,239 --> 00:52:02,558
could do those and we use those a lot on

1315
00:51:59,798 --> 00:52:06,079
uh tropical foliage um when we have

1316
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:07,960
outbreaks but if you're larger and again

1317
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:10,760
need to get lacewing eggs all over the

1318
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:12,519
place the egg jent might work for you

1319
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:14,720
and it's it's amazing you know you can

1320
00:52:12,519 --> 00:52:16,280
mix those eggs in you have an hour and a

1321
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:18,358
half to get them out those lacewing eggs

1322
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:19,798
can survive underwater for 90 minutes

1323
00:52:18,358 --> 00:52:22,358
and as long as you keep your PR your

1324
00:52:19,798 --> 00:52:24,519
pressure below like 40 PSI you're good

1325
00:52:22,358 --> 00:52:25,960
and you know take out your your filters

1326
00:52:24,519 --> 00:52:28,239
cuz you don't want to try to cram Laing

1327
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:31,000
eggs through filters but yeah it's just

1328
00:52:28,239 --> 00:52:33,759
I'm really excited about this um for for

1329
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:36,000
application methods um I'm interested to

1330
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:37,960
see Outdoors you know is this something

1331
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,760
we can use you know we are concerned a

1332
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:41,440
bit about rain because if you put them

1333
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:43,359
on if it heavy rains it's going to wash

1334
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:45,119
them right off so for outdoor or

1335
00:52:43,358 --> 00:52:47,119
overhead overhead irrigation you're

1336
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:48,798
going to have to think about your timing

1337
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:50,798
and I don't think there are clear

1338
00:52:48,798 --> 00:52:52,679
answers yet of when you spray them on if

1339
00:52:50,798 --> 00:52:54,639
it misss will they come off you know how

1340
00:52:52,679 --> 00:52:56,798
much rain does it take to wash wash them

1341
00:52:54,639 --> 00:52:58,838
off but I think for indor production

1342
00:52:56,798 --> 00:53:00,358
drip irrigation you know they're going

1343
00:52:58,838 --> 00:53:03,880
to be

1344
00:53:00,358 --> 00:53:05,798
fine that brings up another question um

1345
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:07,680
I saw and this is a little unrelated but

1346
00:53:05,798 --> 00:53:10,440
the lacewings got me thinking about it

1347
00:53:07,679 --> 00:53:12,598
so I saw a post recently where someone

1348
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:14,920
was uh sort of against beneficial

1349
00:53:12,599 --> 00:53:16,680
insects because they feel like they just

1350
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:18,039
end up in the buds the final product

1351
00:53:16,679 --> 00:53:21,358
with cannabis

1352
00:53:18,039 --> 00:53:24,318
specifically um

1353
00:53:21,358 --> 00:53:27,440
what I I guess how would you address

1354
00:53:24,318 --> 00:53:29,400
that and what Ben beneficial insects um

1355
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:32,400
are less or predatory insects I guess we

1356
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:35,079
should say are less likely to end up um

1357
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:36,880
getting stuck in the tricomes um

1358
00:53:35,079 --> 00:53:40,359
relative to other

1359
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:42,640
ones so when it comes to insects

1360
00:53:40,358 --> 00:53:45,838
beneficials and flowers it can be kind

1361
00:53:42,639 --> 00:53:48,920
of a a touchy thing because um there's

1362
00:53:45,838 --> 00:53:50,279
certain insects definitely like I I have

1363
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:54,838
definitely over the years changed my

1364
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:56,119
tune on uh Ro Beetles the atheta in

1365
00:53:54,838 --> 00:53:57,838
Canada can abis because I've had too

1366
00:53:56,119 --> 00:54:00,480
many cannabis Growers contacting me

1367
00:53:57,838 --> 00:54:03,119
asking how to kill them because they do

1368
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:05,199
get in the bud and flour especially if

1369
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:07,000
they're not happy in the soil there's

1370
00:54:05,199 --> 00:54:08,159
not enough food they go to disperse or

1371
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,599
you have too much food for them and

1372
00:54:08,159 --> 00:54:12,558
their population explodes they can fly

1373
00:54:10,599 --> 00:54:14,920
and get up on the flower so I I

1374
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:16,920
personally don't recommend it anymore

1375
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:18,240
and even using them in like vegetative

1376
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:20,200
because if you put them in vegetative

1377
00:54:18,239 --> 00:54:22,759
they're still going to be there in flow

1378
00:54:20,199 --> 00:54:25,159
so that's one example of one another one

1379
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:28,280
ladybugs I've got a million pictures of

1380
00:54:25,159 --> 00:54:30,199
ladybugs stuck in cannabis buds I think

1381
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:33,480
as long as you stick to things that are

1382
00:54:30,199 --> 00:54:34,838
smaller predatory mites um you know

1383
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:36,400
generally they like to go to the

1384
00:54:34,838 --> 00:54:40,119
undersides of leaves because they're

1385
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:42,880
looking for their food sources there um

1386
00:54:40,119 --> 00:54:44,720
that's not going to be an issue uh you

1387
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:48,079
do have to be careful though with using

1388
00:54:44,719 --> 00:54:50,279
insects um because it's not only can

1389
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:52,640
they get stuck in the bud they can get

1390
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:56,559
stuck in the tricomes on the actual Leaf

1391
00:54:52,639 --> 00:55:00,199
surfaces um so if you have uh a variety

1392
00:54:56,559 --> 00:55:01,920
that's very tromey and super sticky your

1393
00:55:00,199 --> 00:55:03,439
beneficials may not even work especially

1394
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:05,519
for things like will swing if you're

1395
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:06,519
getting a few weeks into flour you

1396
00:55:05,519 --> 00:55:08,599
generally don't even want to use

1397
00:55:06,519 --> 00:55:11,039
lacewing larvae because they can get

1398
00:55:08,599 --> 00:55:13,160
stuck in those tricomes but predatory

1399
00:55:11,039 --> 00:55:14,960
mites because they are so small they can

1400
00:55:13,159 --> 00:55:16,558
navigate their way through and you know

1401
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:19,119
I don't know if his issue is is like you

1402
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:22,119
feel like he's going to fail or is it

1403
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:24,440
you know the the gross factor of like oh

1404
00:55:22,119 --> 00:55:27,079
I may consume an insect because we all

1405
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:29,039
know we all eat insects all day long in

1406
00:55:27,079 --> 00:55:33,599
all our food that's the reality of it

1407
00:55:29,039 --> 00:55:36,200
it's just another protein Source um but

1408
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:38,760
considering the Alternatives you don't

1409
00:55:36,199 --> 00:55:41,159
have many other Alternatives but this is

1410
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:44,520
why you need to start your management

1411
00:55:41,159 --> 00:55:47,078
programs in propagation continue them

1412
00:55:44,519 --> 00:55:49,798
heavy through vegetative so you

1413
00:55:47,079 --> 00:55:51,880
shouldn't have to treat heavy in flower

1414
00:55:49,798 --> 00:55:54,119
but generally people wait till they have

1415
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:56,880
a problem and then it's too hard to

1416
00:55:54,119 --> 00:55:59,160
clean up yeah a God to start your bios

1417
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:01,160
in

1418
00:55:59,159 --> 00:56:04,960
propagation yeah I think the issue was

1419
00:56:01,159 --> 00:56:07,719
insect Parts insects and insect frass

1420
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:10,880
their poop ending up on the buds

1421
00:56:07,719 --> 00:56:12,959
themselves that you end up smoking um or

1422
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:16,200
having to pick out of your uh okay you

1423
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:19,240
know finish buds mites like don't have

1424
00:56:16,199 --> 00:56:21,759
little poops it's more like a liquid and

1425
00:56:19,239 --> 00:56:23,679
you're not picking those out ever you

1426
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:26,720
know if you get caterpillars those will

1427
00:56:23,679 --> 00:56:28,639
leave giant honk and poop poops in in in

1428
00:56:26,719 --> 00:56:30,558
your bud I mean yeah there are some

1429
00:56:28,639 --> 00:56:32,519
caterpillars have giant I mean

1430
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:34,798
grasshoppers have giant big salid poops

1431
00:56:32,519 --> 00:56:36,239
but a lot of these insects more they

1432
00:56:34,798 --> 00:56:37,679
don't create I don't know I'm trying to

1433
00:56:36,239 --> 00:56:39,798
be very delicate around words they don't

1434
00:56:37,679 --> 00:56:41,399
have solid bowel movements they just

1435
00:56:39,798 --> 00:56:43,960
have liquid because they're more feeding

1436
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:45,240
on plant juices so depending on what

1437
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:47,920
they're eating because caterpillars

1438
00:56:45,239 --> 00:56:50,118
consume all the fiber caterpillars

1439
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:53,159
grasshoppers consume all the fiber mites

1440
00:56:50,119 --> 00:56:55,119
and thrips are more sucking the contents

1441
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:57,679
of plant tissue out and not actually

1442
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:59,280
eating the plant tissue is that if that

1443
00:56:57,679 --> 00:57:01,679
makes sense so there's not going to be

1444
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:03,680
poops to pick

1445
00:57:01,679 --> 00:57:05,199
out okay yeah that was just one of the

1446
00:57:03,679 --> 00:57:06,719
complaints with beneficial insects that

1447
00:57:05,199 --> 00:57:09,000
I thought would be interesting to

1448
00:57:06,719 --> 00:57:10,358
mention today there's always going to be

1449
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,599
when we were chatting there's always

1450
00:57:10,358 --> 00:57:15,358
going to be people that have complaints

1451
00:57:12,599 --> 00:57:18,280
about something and on the scale of

1452
00:57:15,358 --> 00:57:21,078
issues I deal with every day poops from

1453
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:22,000
beneficial insect being on the plants is

1454
00:57:21,079 --> 00:57:23,880
not

1455
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:26,039
one well it's probably more it's

1456
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:28,240
probably more the bodies to be fair to

1457
00:57:26,039 --> 00:57:30,119
you know accurately portray the argument

1458
00:57:28,239 --> 00:57:33,239
um yeah you don't I mean no one wants to

1459
00:57:30,119 --> 00:57:35,838
be picking you know fungus knats out of

1460
00:57:33,239 --> 00:57:37,639
their out of their buds and things like

1461
00:57:35,838 --> 00:57:39,719
that but like you said there's not a lot

1462
00:57:37,639 --> 00:57:41,118
of great options in flour we don't want

1463
00:57:39,719 --> 00:57:44,038
to be spraying anything that's going to

1464
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:46,519
be leaving a residue on the tricomes

1465
00:57:44,039 --> 00:57:49,799
anywh or damaging them so beneficial

1466
00:57:46,519 --> 00:57:51,280
insects are really about it and if you

1467
00:57:49,798 --> 00:57:52,759
know you see photos online of people

1468
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:55,280
with like webbing from two spot

1469
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:56,960
spidermites you know three qus of the

1470
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:58,720
way through flower and they're like what

1471
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:00,000
do I do you know or you get that phone

1472
00:57:58,719 --> 00:58:02,838
call and it's like there's really not

1473
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:05,000
much you can do at that point safely

1474
00:58:02,838 --> 00:58:07,078
after you punch yourself in the face for

1475
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:09,798
screwing up get in your time machine and

1476
00:58:07,079 --> 00:58:11,318
go back and do your preventative program

1477
00:58:09,798 --> 00:58:13,798
when you don't think you have a problem

1478
00:58:11,318 --> 00:58:16,719
to prevent that from happening because

1479
00:58:13,798 --> 00:58:18,400
that literally does not happen overnight

1480
00:58:16,719 --> 00:58:21,919
it's been building and building and

1481
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:23,798
building and uh you weren't being

1482
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:26,720
preventative in your program you cannot

1483
00:58:23,798 --> 00:58:29,599
wait till you have a problem great I

1484
00:58:26,719 --> 00:58:31,519
don't have anything to add to that so uh

1485
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:33,519
moving on was there anything else uh

1486
00:58:31,519 --> 00:58:35,559
that you wanted to talk about regarding

1487
00:58:33,519 --> 00:58:38,318
sort of I guess this has kind of turned

1488
00:58:35,559 --> 00:58:39,480
into like sort of a new product podcast

1489
00:58:38,318 --> 00:58:41,920
of things that you found that are

1490
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:43,559
exciting is there any new research

1491
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:45,000
that's come out in the last year in

1492
00:58:43,559 --> 00:58:48,960
relation to cannabis that you might want

1493
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:52,079
to share too um on actual

1494
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:54,318
cannabis um no but it was very

1495
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:56,960
interesting I'm just don't even have to

1496
00:58:54,318 --> 00:58:58,798
comment on this but I so when I was at

1497
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:00,960
the meeting in France I was at the

1498
00:58:58,798 --> 00:59:06,119
international organization of biocontrol

1499
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:08,960
um conference um in breast France late

1500
00:59:06,119 --> 00:59:11,838
fall and it it was a very intense

1501
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:13,318
meeting uh we started it like 8:30 in

1502
00:59:11,838 --> 00:59:16,558
the morning and went to about 6:00 every

1503
00:59:13,318 --> 00:59:18,639
day with presentations on um basic kind

1504
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:21,680
of what's going on around the world with

1505
00:59:18,639 --> 00:59:23,639
biocontrol um what research is happening

1506
00:59:21,679 --> 00:59:26,719
who's doing what and of course cannabis

1507
00:59:23,639 --> 00:59:30,199
came up and when I talk to the European

1508
00:59:26,719 --> 00:59:33,759
people about the isus with Aspirus and

1509
00:59:30,199 --> 00:59:35,000
cannabis they're like what and I'm like

1510
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:36,000
well you know this is a thing in the

1511
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,159
states where they're doing all this

1512
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:40,400
testing and they're like what and most

1513
00:59:38,159 --> 00:59:44,279
of them had never even heard of this

1514
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:50,200
phenomenon of Aspirus and the crazy

1515
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:53,200
thing is is so Aspirus um the genus um

1516
00:59:50,199 --> 00:59:55,358
there were actually presentations on

1517
00:59:53,199 --> 00:59:59,480
using different

1518
00:59:55,358 --> 01:00:01,038
species of Aspirus as biocontrol agents

1519
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:04,318
and we were talking about this and I

1520
01:00:01,039 --> 01:00:07,119
said because in the US and Canada there

1521
01:00:04,318 --> 01:00:08,798
is such a a negative connotation with

1522
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:10,640
the word aspergilus that even if you

1523
01:00:08,798 --> 01:00:13,440
came to the market with Aspirus that was

1524
01:00:10,639 --> 01:00:15,118
the best biocontrol microbial ever

1525
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:17,079
because the name aspergilus is in there

1526
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:20,079
nobody will use it but it was just

1527
01:00:17,079 --> 01:00:22,359
interesting how the Aspirus thing is not

1528
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:24,039
even on their radar for European

1529
01:00:22,358 --> 01:00:25,480
cannabis and it has been such a big

1530
01:00:24,039 --> 01:00:28,079
issue here the

1531
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:29,519
states H yeah that is interesting I

1532
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:32,559
don't know that I have any comments on

1533
01:00:29,519 --> 01:00:36,519
it other than I didn't realize how

1534
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:42,640
serious of of the mot toxin is produced

1535
01:00:36,519 --> 01:00:45,639
by the species that can show up on in

1536
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:47,920
cannabis or in you know edible crops

1537
01:00:45,639 --> 01:00:50,798
corn and just

1538
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:52,798
how yeah how just how dangerous it was I

1539
01:00:50,798 --> 01:00:55,798
had kind of always just you know sort of

1540
01:00:52,798 --> 01:00:57,280
pooed it like yeah you know molden mil

1541
01:00:55,798 --> 01:00:59,960
do is probably not a big deal you know

1542
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:01,480
if you have a healthy immune system um

1543
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:02,760
but when I listened to the presentation

1544
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:04,039
I learned that like this is actually a

1545
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:06,319
really serious thing that's why like you

1546
01:01:04,039 --> 01:01:08,839
talk mentioned corn I think of like

1547
01:01:06,318 --> 01:01:10,798
peanuts and AFF toxins that are produced

1548
01:01:08,838 --> 01:01:12,880
um potentially with that like with the

1549
01:01:10,798 --> 01:01:15,480
production of them like it's

1550
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:17,318
uh it's it's a serious thing and so I'm

1551
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:19,719
glad that that we're looking at it I I

1552
01:01:17,318 --> 01:01:21,000
don't think the testing has caught up

1553
01:01:19,719 --> 01:01:22,558
with it to the point where we're

1554
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,559
actually accurately testing what we need

1555
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:25,839
to be testing but that's a totally

1556
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:27,319
different issue all together well but

1557
01:01:25,838 --> 01:01:29,838
but you look at the food industry you

1558
01:01:27,318 --> 01:01:33,079
know and if you have not seen that

1559
01:01:29,838 --> 01:01:34,798
webinar it's funny that webinar that I

1560
01:01:33,079 --> 01:01:36,318
think it was Oregon State University or

1561
01:01:34,798 --> 01:01:39,038
was it was it the state of Oregon day

1562
01:01:36,318 --> 01:01:41,119
that was the one was it OSU I can't

1563
01:01:39,039 --> 01:01:43,119
remember but that was I I want to say

1564
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:44,440
OSU but I it could have been the state

1565
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:46,519
of Oregon but that was the one that we

1566
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:48,280
were both on yeah and I was watching

1567
01:01:46,519 --> 01:01:51,119
that while I was waiting to get on my

1568
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:53,720
flight to go to Europe at the airport

1569
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:56,440
and I didn't realize how much money the

1570
01:01:53,719 --> 01:01:59,679
corn industry spent testing at you know

1571
01:01:56,440 --> 01:02:02,798
for if you've not seen that webinar you

1572
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:04,159
need it it was really interesting and it

1573
01:02:02,798 --> 01:02:07,119
was interesting because right after that

1574
01:02:04,159 --> 01:02:09,480
webinar was it Oregon and I think was it

1575
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:12,640
New York State dropped the aspila

1576
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:15,079
testing didn't they for Canabis I can't

1577
01:02:12,639 --> 01:02:17,639
speak to New York but Oregon yeah Oregon

1578
01:02:15,079 --> 01:02:19,880
put a a hold on that for a while because

1579
01:02:17,639 --> 01:02:22,558
it was another state followed maybe it's

1580
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:25,599
not New York I'm watch but if you not

1581
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:27,839
watch that it's just even from a food

1582
01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:29,200
history standpoint it's super

1583
01:02:27,838 --> 01:02:31,798
interesting I'd kind of like to go back

1584
01:02:29,199 --> 01:02:34,278
and rewatch that again to process it all

1585
01:02:31,798 --> 01:02:38,599
better because also I didn't realize

1586
01:02:34,278 --> 01:02:40,239
what a diverse group Aspirus is because

1587
01:02:38,599 --> 01:02:41,480
you know we're taught you know Aspirus

1588
01:02:40,239 --> 01:02:42,358
bad and then they go to Europe and

1589
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:45,960
they're talking about look at the

1590
01:02:42,358 --> 01:02:48,199
benefits of Aspirus I'm like what um and

1591
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:50,920
it just shows you like how much we don't

1592
01:02:48,199 --> 01:02:52,960
know and how fast we are to paint with a

1593
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:55,519
broad brush when we really don't

1594
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:58,000
understand all those detail details but

1595
01:02:55,519 --> 01:02:59,719
I would highly recommend to go back and

1596
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,440
anybody to to watch that cuz it was

1597
01:02:59,719 --> 01:03:03,959
super

1598
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:06,278
interesting yeah my complaint with it

1599
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:08,199
with it though was um basically all they

1600
01:03:06,278 --> 01:03:10,440
were saying is like we need to test for

1601
01:03:08,199 --> 01:03:12,639
it it's really bad it can have all these

1602
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:15,760
negative human effects we don't know

1603
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:18,759
what combustion does in relation to this

1604
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:20,680
um or or into your lungs um we don't

1605
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:22,039
have any solutions for how to manage it

1606
01:03:20,679 --> 01:03:25,038
they didn't give you any management

1607
01:03:22,039 --> 01:03:26,278
options um no but I found the history

1608
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:28,680
that was what was really interesting to

1609
01:03:26,278 --> 01:03:31,639
me cuz I didn't know that it was this

1610
01:03:28,679 --> 01:03:34,759
big thing in in

1611
01:03:31,639 --> 01:03:37,719
food yeah yeah but if you're going there

1612
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:40,440
to try and get Solutions it's not no

1613
01:03:37,719 --> 01:03:43,798
from a historical food standpoint it was

1614
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:47,480
interesting speaking of microbial stuff

1615
01:03:43,798 --> 01:03:49,759
the other thing I am super duper excited

1616
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:51,519
about I move my camera I feel like I'm

1617
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:54,079
sliding down on the sofa as the

1618
01:03:51,519 --> 01:03:59,719
conversation goes on um put my head back

1619
01:03:54,079 --> 01:04:02,000
on the the middle um is uh okay so there

1620
01:03:59,719 --> 01:04:05,038
is a company in Canada called

1621
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:08,838
anius and they produce a product called

1622
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:10,880
bioceros which contains Bavaria basana

1623
01:04:08,838 --> 01:04:14,440
that is the

1624
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:17,480
same type of fungus that's in botanigard

1625
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:21,880
but it is a different strain this is the

1626
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:25,199
entt strain that's in bioer was isolated

1627
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:28,318
um in Canada by the research oologist at

1628
01:04:25,199 --> 01:04:30,759
anius so we've had the wedw powder of

1629
01:04:28,318 --> 01:04:34,038
bioceros for a while on the market here

1630
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:36,799
that's not new news what I am super

1631
01:04:34,039 --> 01:04:39,119
super super excited about is they now

1632
01:04:36,798 --> 01:04:41,239
have it in a granular

1633
01:04:39,119 --> 01:04:44,440
formulation and the idea with this is

1634
01:04:41,239 --> 01:04:47,719
you pre-incorporated it into the soil

1635
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:49,519
and I think for cannabis for rude Aid

1636
01:04:47,719 --> 01:04:53,919
this is going to be the game

1637
01:04:49,519 --> 01:04:55,639
Cher because the problem with drenching

1638
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:59,119
uh these microbial products whether

1639
01:04:55,639 --> 01:05:01,759
using Bavaria or aeria or even

1640
01:04:59,119 --> 01:05:04,760
meisum um is when you put it on the soil

1641
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:06,880
surface soil Sur soil is a filter and

1642
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:08,640
the spores you don't get enough high

1643
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:11,599
enough Spore concentration deep down in

1644
01:05:08,639 --> 01:05:13,759
the pot where the root apid can be so

1645
01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:15,400
yes if you're in a propagation cell

1646
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:18,319
probably yes but if you start getting to

1647
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:19,880
a three gallon s gallon pot or or bigger

1648
01:05:18,318 --> 01:05:21,759
you're not going to get enough spores in

1649
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:23,599
there but if you can pre- incorporate

1650
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:25,039
this so it's homogeneously mixed the

1651
01:05:23,599 --> 01:05:26,760
bavar throughout the soil you're going

1652
01:05:25,039 --> 01:05:29,119
to have as much Bia in the bottom of the

1653
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:31,599
pot as the top because the root apids

1654
01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:33,960
are all through that soil profile so I'm

1655
01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:35,838
super excited that there is this

1656
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:38,358
granular product I'm also excited for it

1657
01:05:35,838 --> 01:05:40,679
for Turf for things like chinch buug

1658
01:05:38,358 --> 01:05:44,239
management and grubs so there's a lot of

1659
01:05:40,679 --> 01:05:47,480
potential with this um and also to be

1660
01:05:44,239 --> 01:05:51,159
super excited is another company called

1661
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:54,880
Lolly um they are the producers of the

1662
01:05:51,159 --> 01:05:59,480
metrium um it used to be sold as as um

1663
01:05:54,880 --> 01:06:01,200
met 52 but now they have the metum also

1664
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:03,480
in a granular

1665
01:06:01,199 --> 01:06:06,719
formulation don't ask me which one's

1666
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:08,880
going to be better for rude AIDS yet um

1667
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:11,838
there needs to be side to side trials I

1668
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:13,920
do know um some companies are trying to

1669
01:06:11,838 --> 01:06:18,239
get rud Aid colonies going so that they

1670
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:20,760
can look at um you know how these two

1671
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:23,358
different fungi perform it may come down

1672
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:24,880
to you know your soil type what other

1673
01:06:23,358 --> 01:06:26,759
microbes you have in your soil there

1674
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:29,200
could be a lot of variables but to have

1675
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:29,960
the options to pre-incorporated two of

1676
01:06:29,199 --> 01:06:33,239
these

1677
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:35,278
fungi either one you know into the soil

1678
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:37,719
so you don't have to hand wrench and

1679
01:06:35,278 --> 01:06:41,079
they're there as a preventative I'm

1680
01:06:37,719 --> 01:06:43,959
super excited about we also know um from

1681
01:06:41,079 --> 01:06:46,200
uh research several years ago um at the

1682
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:50,119
University of Vermont they've shown that

1683
01:06:46,199 --> 01:06:51,879
if you have Bavaria either on rice or

1684
01:06:50,119 --> 01:06:54,798
Mill it as a carry and pre-incorporated

1685
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:56,358
in the soil it will just kind of fill

1686
01:06:54,798 --> 01:06:59,159
your soil with Bavaria and then when

1687
01:06:56,358 --> 01:07:03,639
thrips drop to pupate it will actually

1688
01:06:59,159 --> 01:07:05,000
kill the thrips pupating in the soil so

1689
01:07:03,639 --> 01:07:07,400
I I think we're going to see a lot of

1690
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:08,440
benefits from this and I'm super excited

1691
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:10,960
for these

1692
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:15,278
products can you back up a little bit

1693
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:17,519
for us and talk about what um yeah what

1694
01:07:15,278 --> 01:07:19,199
Bavaria targets as well as meisum and

1695
01:07:17,519 --> 01:07:25,079
what maybe those differences are between

1696
01:07:19,199 --> 01:07:27,358
the two for grow so Bavaria um

1697
01:07:25,079 --> 01:07:31,318
and when you start reading about Bavaria

1698
01:07:27,358 --> 01:07:34,318
you read a lot about beetles um and uh

1699
01:07:31,318 --> 01:07:37,440
it does a good job on beetles but for

1700
01:07:34,318 --> 01:07:41,679
protected indoor egg it's mostly used

1701
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:43,358
for thrips management it's used for uh

1702
01:07:41,679 --> 01:07:47,239
it's really good on white

1703
01:07:43,358 --> 01:07:48,639
flies um aphids you you kind of have to

1704
01:07:47,239 --> 01:07:50,239
tank mix it with an insect growth

1705
01:07:48,639 --> 01:07:52,598
regulator so we don't recommend it a lot

1706
01:07:50,239 --> 01:07:55,159
for folar aphids root aphids are

1707
01:07:52,599 --> 01:07:57,318
different um but for folar aphids you

1708
01:07:55,159 --> 01:07:59,879
need to have an igr tanks with them but

1709
01:07:57,318 --> 01:08:01,880
really we target you know thrips and

1710
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:05,798
white flies is is the main target you

1711
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:08,480
can infect other things um now the

1712
01:08:05,798 --> 01:08:11,440
meisum traditionally again that's a bit

1713
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:15,199
more of a a beetle product it used to be

1714
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:16,880
used heavily um for uh management of

1715
01:08:15,199 --> 01:08:19,158
things like black Vine

1716
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:20,838
Weevil Cornell has done great research

1717
01:08:19,158 --> 01:08:22,519
on that with pre- incorporating it into

1718
01:08:20,838 --> 01:08:25,278
the soil and showing it how it persists

1719
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:28,279
and persists in the soil but it can also

1720
01:08:25,279 --> 01:08:29,839
infect other pests and this is again

1721
01:08:28,279 --> 01:08:31,679
don't ask me which one's going to be

1722
01:08:29,838 --> 01:08:36,238
better for rud Aid because that we don't

1723
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:38,798
have the answer yet um but you are going

1724
01:08:36,238 --> 01:08:41,119
to be air quote a little technically

1725
01:08:38,798 --> 01:08:43,238
limited by the labels because not all

1726
01:08:41,119 --> 01:08:47,759
these pests are on all the labels and

1727
01:08:43,238 --> 01:08:52,079
again the labels are the law um for them

1728
01:08:47,759 --> 01:08:54,079
but almost everybody has thrips so um

1729
01:08:52,079 --> 01:08:56,640
you know pre-incorporation as a pre

1730
01:08:54,079 --> 01:08:59,640
thrips preventive I think is a good safe

1731
01:08:56,640 --> 01:09:01,880
place to to recommend these

1732
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:03,880
products and one thing you mentioned I

1733
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:05,679
want to go back and and just highlight

1734
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:09,319
is you mentioned it's a different strain

1735
01:09:05,679 --> 01:09:12,759
between banard and banard and

1736
01:09:09,319 --> 01:09:16,440
bioceros and you know we when we talk

1737
01:09:12,759 --> 01:09:21,359
about these microbials like uh micro

1738
01:09:16,439 --> 01:09:23,798
isal fungi or Bavaria uh there is going

1739
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:25,359
to be a difference so whether it's and I

1740
01:09:23,798 --> 01:09:27,838
talked about this in a recent podcast I

1741
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:31,120
did but like uh you know Riso fagus or

1742
01:09:27,838 --> 01:09:33,198
regularis is not the same from different

1743
01:09:31,119 --> 01:09:34,719
companies they're one might be slightly

1744
01:09:33,198 --> 01:09:38,238
have slightly more drought tolerance or

1745
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:40,198
perform better at this PH range or um

1746
01:09:38,238 --> 01:09:43,519
you know deal with a certain temperature

1747
01:09:40,198 --> 01:09:45,119
better so um don't you know we can't

1748
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:47,319
just use the word Bavaria and assume

1749
01:09:45,119 --> 01:09:48,798
that it's the same product and I just so

1750
01:09:47,319 --> 01:09:50,600
people have to do a little research or

1751
01:09:48,798 --> 01:09:51,880
maybe try one Bavaria in your

1752
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:53,400
environment if that doesn't work don't

1753
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:56,359
assume that all Bavaria won't work try a

1754
01:09:53,399 --> 01:09:58,238
different one too so uh yeah just just

1755
01:09:56,359 --> 01:10:00,519
something I wanted to add yeah so

1756
01:09:58,238 --> 01:10:03,639
currently on the market to make things

1757
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:06,159
clear as far as strains of Bavaria

1758
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:08,159
basana that is EPA

1759
01:10:06,158 --> 01:10:10,238
registered there are three different

1760
01:10:08,158 --> 01:10:13,839
strains on the market there's the GHA

1761
01:10:10,238 --> 01:10:15,519
strain that's in uh banag guard which by

1762
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:17,960
the way so everybody knows is not sold

1763
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:19,600
by bioworks anymore so you cannot go to

1764
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:24,960
bioworks for help it has been given now

1765
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:28,719
to op chemicals um and the next one is

1766
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:33,198
the entt strain um and that's the one

1767
01:10:28,719 --> 01:10:35,319
that comes from anitus um that uh they

1768
01:10:33,198 --> 01:10:39,359
they discovered up in Canada and then

1769
01:10:35,319 --> 01:10:41,399
the third one is uh bavia basana and

1770
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:46,839
that's

1771
01:10:41,399 --> 01:10:48,000
5339 um that is um a strain that is sold

1772
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:52,360
that's in

1773
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:54,560
velifer velifer is a liquid product B

1774
01:10:52,359 --> 01:10:58,119
tanard comes as well wable powder and

1775
01:10:54,560 --> 01:11:00,320
liquid the bioer comes as liquid

1776
01:10:58,119 --> 01:11:04,319
wettable powder and

1777
01:11:00,319 --> 01:11:06,238
granular so it can be kind of confusing

1778
01:11:04,319 --> 01:11:08,960
I've actually put in at several meetings

1779
01:11:06,238 --> 01:11:10,799
to do um I'm actually going to do it I'm

1780
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:13,239
going to be in Colorado Denver in three

1781
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:16,119
weeks um which by the time this is

1782
01:11:13,238 --> 01:11:18,198
posted it may be then um but I'm going

1783
01:11:16,119 --> 01:11:20,319
to be at the pr Green Expo and I'm doing

1784
01:11:18,198 --> 01:11:22,198
a whole talk just on these microbial

1785
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:24,079
products what's the difference different

1786
01:11:22,198 --> 01:11:27,119
formulations when you use what and

1787
01:11:24,079 --> 01:11:28,840
really go into depth on that so again on

1788
01:11:27,119 --> 01:11:31,079
the the Bavaria there's basically three

1789
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:31,079
different

1790
01:11:31,198 --> 01:11:38,158
strains now when it comes to what used

1791
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:40,880
to be called called iseria which is now

1792
01:11:38,158 --> 01:11:43,238
the genus has changed to CPS and it's

1793
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:45,960
firmer Roosa which I always struggle

1794
01:11:43,238 --> 01:11:49,238
over that there are in the US market

1795
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:51,000
currently two strains there is the apopa

1796
01:11:49,238 --> 01:11:53,158
strain that was isolated by the

1797
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:57,039
University of Florida in Apopka and that

1798
01:11:53,158 --> 01:11:58,879
is what is in Anora and pfr 97 and then

1799
01:11:57,039 --> 01:12:03,079
you have the

1800
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:05,880
9901 strain that is from pretty sure

1801
01:12:03,079 --> 01:12:07,800
it's from Spain um and that's where it's

1802
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:14,119
produced and that is the active

1803
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:16,000
ingredient in noly and isid um and isaid

1804
01:12:14,119 --> 01:12:18,399
is the one from copert noly is one

1805
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:22,000
that's uh generally sold by several

1806
01:12:18,399 --> 01:12:25,158
different distributors so even inside of

1807
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:28,319
the um ctis seeps iseria there's two

1808
01:12:25,158 --> 01:12:30,559
different strains and then with the

1809
01:12:28,319 --> 01:12:33,359
meisum currently on the market in the US

1810
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:37,159
there's only one strain and that's the F

1811
01:12:33,359 --> 01:12:39,158
uh 52 and that's being sold under lard

1812
01:12:37,158 --> 01:12:41,839
and that is from

1813
01:12:39,158 --> 01:12:44,198
lont if you can keep that all

1814
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:48,560
straight have you seen different

1815
01:12:44,198 --> 01:12:48,559
efficacy with different

1816
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:54,400
strains I don't even know to answer that

1817
01:12:51,198 --> 01:12:57,119
because the problem is every every media

1818
01:12:54,399 --> 01:12:58,679
is different and I've asked several

1819
01:12:57,119 --> 01:13:00,920
times if researchers would do

1820
01:12:58,679 --> 01:13:03,679
head-to-head comparisons under the same

1821
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:05,440
soils the same pest the same environment

1822
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:09,039
and nobody's really done research on

1823
01:13:05,439 --> 01:13:11,439
that yet um so we don't have good

1824
01:13:09,039 --> 01:13:13,840
answers but I will say generally as what

1825
01:13:11,439 --> 01:13:15,359
you said is what we do we try one if it

1826
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:16,400
doesn't work then we try another one if

1827
01:13:15,359 --> 01:13:19,279
that doesn't work we try another one

1828
01:13:16,399 --> 01:13:21,238
until we find one that works for your

1829
01:13:19,279 --> 01:13:23,880
soil your moisture and also your

1830
01:13:21,238 --> 01:13:26,000
microbes because I do think there's some

1831
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:27,800
competition between all these microbes

1832
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:29,479
going in the soil and some of these inop

1833
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:33,920
pathogens and some of them are being

1834
01:13:29,479 --> 01:13:37,559
outcompeted or even eaten up by things

1835
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:40,600
you're that are already in the

1836
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:43,360
soil because you could do a trial let's

1837
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:46,480
say in a in a soilless media you know

1838
01:13:43,359 --> 01:13:49,399
let's grow even like a sterile perlite

1839
01:13:46,479 --> 01:13:52,279
and throw rud AIDS in there throw you

1840
01:13:49,399 --> 01:13:53,679
know cannabis in there and throw each

1841
01:13:52,279 --> 01:13:55,679
one of these products in there and one

1842
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:57,158
may outperform it but then if you go to

1843
01:13:55,679 --> 01:13:58,960
your greenhouse and actually do it in

1844
01:13:57,158 --> 01:14:01,319
your so type you may get a completely

1845
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:04,158
different result that's a that's a good

1846
01:14:01,319 --> 01:14:05,759
point and unfortunately with pesticides

1847
01:14:04,158 --> 01:14:07,759
that are EPA registered you get the

1848
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:10,239
strain you get that strain name

1849
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:12,840
separated out but with uh something like

1850
01:14:10,238 --> 01:14:15,359
microle fungi or other you know some of

1851
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:18,400
the other basilla species you don't see

1852
01:14:15,359 --> 01:14:21,238
that so and to further complicate things

1853
01:14:18,399 --> 01:14:25,000
you know there may only be a few there's

1854
01:14:21,238 --> 01:14:27,399
only two Manu three manufacturers of

1855
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:30,000
micro risal fungi like Endo micro risal

1856
01:14:27,399 --> 01:14:33,119
funi when we talk about like Riso Vegas

1857
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:37,520
regularis glomus inates um that I'm

1858
01:14:33,119 --> 01:14:40,719
aware of currently and so if you're not

1859
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:42,679
buying from you know dinico RTI or

1860
01:14:40,719 --> 01:14:45,319
Premiere um you're probably buying from

1861
01:14:42,679 --> 01:14:48,560
a reseller that's buying it in and and

1862
01:14:45,319 --> 01:14:49,759
relabeling it so you don't it gets even

1863
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:51,239
more complicated to figure out what

1864
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:53,760
strain you actually try it I guess is

1865
01:14:51,238 --> 01:14:54,839
what I'm getting at on the my microbial

1866
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:57,520
side when we talk about you know

1867
01:14:54,840 --> 01:15:00,159
fertilizer bio stimulant products versus

1868
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:02,440
pesticides where at least you know you

1869
01:15:00,158 --> 01:15:05,039
know the strain The Strain name of what

1870
01:15:02,439 --> 01:15:07,919
you're getting so that's that's one

1871
01:15:05,039 --> 01:15:11,439
advantage yeah yeah and I mean this

1872
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:14,000
whole thing about these bio stimulants

1873
01:15:11,439 --> 01:15:16,638
um you know bu or beware because they're

1874
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:20,920
really not being regulated at this point

1875
01:15:16,639 --> 01:15:24,119
uh one of a mutual acquaintance of ours

1876
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:27,639
did he got a package of a product

1877
01:15:24,119 --> 01:15:29,399
calculated out the Spore size calculated

1878
01:15:27,639 --> 01:15:31,480
it out according to the number that said

1879
01:15:29,399 --> 01:15:33,039
it was in there and when he did the math

1880
01:15:31,479 --> 01:15:34,638
the number of spores they were claimed

1881
01:15:33,039 --> 01:15:36,399
were in the package would physically not

1882
01:15:34,639 --> 01:15:37,520
even fit in the package they claimed

1883
01:15:36,399 --> 01:15:40,079
that was in

1884
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:41,760
there yeah yeah no you have to be very

1885
01:15:40,079 --> 01:15:44,719
careful especially where you're getting

1886
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:46,199
your microbes from for sure yes just

1887
01:15:44,719 --> 01:15:49,520
like your beneficials you have to be

1888
01:15:46,198 --> 01:15:51,759
very careful with all of that

1889
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:55,199
so great well anything else that you

1890
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:57,199
want to touch on here well today you

1891
01:15:55,198 --> 01:15:59,039
know I could go on forever but you know

1892
01:15:57,198 --> 01:16:01,158
we've kind of already eclipsed over an

1893
01:15:59,039 --> 01:16:06,198
hour and we don't want to keep people

1894
01:16:01,158 --> 01:16:09,158
too long um but uh I I will apologize I

1895
01:16:06,198 --> 01:16:11,039
am trying to get social media content

1896
01:16:09,158 --> 01:16:12,439
out but I say this all the time and I

1897
01:16:11,039 --> 01:16:14,479
just when you're out in the field

1898
01:16:12,439 --> 01:16:17,960
working you don't have time to make

1899
01:16:14,479 --> 01:16:20,559
posts and I have ideas great posts in my

1900
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:22,399
head but it's just with with traveling

1901
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:24,639
you know almost every single week I I

1902
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:28,439
struggle to keep up with posting on

1903
01:16:24,639 --> 01:16:29,840
social media I just I'm too busy to post

1904
01:16:28,439 --> 01:16:32,039
so I'm going to try though part of my

1905
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:35,199
newers resolutions Tad said I have to

1906
01:16:32,039 --> 01:16:38,198
make three posts a week according to a a

1907
01:16:35,198 --> 01:16:40,000
scientific one a personal one and of

1908
01:16:38,198 --> 01:16:42,319
interest and I've gotten none of that

1909
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:44,279
done yet so far I got one post from the

1910
01:16:42,319 --> 01:16:46,960
show this week a picture of me and some

1911
01:16:44,279 --> 01:16:48,198
friends yeah you said three posts are

1912
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:50,639
like the thing you're supposed to do to

1913
01:16:48,198 --> 01:16:53,238
stay active

1914
01:16:50,639 --> 01:16:54,560
oh oh I don't remember that I I'm

1915
01:16:53,238 --> 01:16:57,158
probably the last person to talk to when

1916
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:58,760
it comes to Social Media stuff um but uh

1917
01:16:57,158 --> 01:17:01,319
that sounds like good advice to me now

1918
01:16:58,760 --> 01:17:03,079
that I'm hearing it so I'll take credit

1919
01:17:01,319 --> 01:17:06,238
um one thing that you you were helping

1920
01:17:03,079 --> 01:17:08,158
us with that I want to mention um that

1921
01:17:06,238 --> 01:17:10,000
we we're I think we just have to get one

1922
01:17:08,158 --> 01:17:12,399
more look over by you before we release

1923
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:14,840
it and and and the reason I'm mentioning

1924
01:17:12,399 --> 01:17:17,759
is because um I think it brings up an

1925
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:21,480
interesting point so we see these these

1926
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:24,960
beneficial bug guides that say you know

1927
01:17:21,479 --> 01:17:29,039
this this this predatory might or

1928
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:31,239
beneficial Targets this pest um but it's

1929
01:17:29,039 --> 01:17:33,639
so much more complicated than that as

1930
01:17:31,238 --> 01:17:35,638
I've learned from you so they may they

1931
01:17:33,639 --> 01:17:37,159
may Target this pest they may they may

1932
01:17:35,639 --> 01:17:40,600
have a secondary pest that they'll

1933
01:17:37,158 --> 01:17:42,960
they'll eat um but not as effectively or

1934
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:44,400
they may eat something this other pest

1935
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:46,079
but only if there's no other food

1936
01:17:44,399 --> 01:17:47,759
sources around and they're in a Petri

1937
01:17:46,079 --> 01:17:50,719
dish and so it really isn't effective in

1938
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:52,159
real life to buy you know say this

1939
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:54,520
particular insect to deal with this

1940
01:17:52,158 --> 01:17:57,158
particular pest so so uh you helped us

1941
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:58,960
come up with a guide that kind of breaks

1942
01:17:57,158 --> 01:18:01,039
that down a little bit more saying you

1943
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:03,079
know this likes to eat this it might

1944
01:18:01,039 --> 01:18:05,319
feed on this and even though there's

1945
01:18:03,079 --> 01:18:07,039
research showing it does occasionally

1946
01:18:05,319 --> 01:18:08,840
eat this other bug don't count on

1947
01:18:07,039 --> 01:18:11,158
getting any sort of suppression or

1948
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:12,440
protection from it did I phrase that

1949
01:18:11,158 --> 01:18:15,039
yeah because I mean there's a difference

1950
01:18:12,439 --> 01:18:17,039
of does it eat it or does it control it

1951
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:18,238
and one of the the new okay I wasn't

1952
01:18:17,039 --> 01:18:19,119
going to go into any more information

1953
01:18:18,238 --> 01:18:21,678
but we're going to go into more

1954
01:18:19,119 --> 01:18:23,639
information that ties into this

1955
01:18:21,679 --> 01:18:26,760
something that is really come to light

1956
01:18:23,639 --> 01:18:29,800
with us uh working on this new um

1957
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:32,400
invasive thrips this parvy spinus um

1958
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:34,800
thrips it's thrips parvy spinus thrips

1959
01:18:32,399 --> 01:18:37,279
is the genus parve parvy spinus is the

1960
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:40,600
species is

1961
01:18:37,279 --> 01:18:43,319
that how looking at

1962
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:45,719
biocontrols you get different results on

1963
01:18:43,319 --> 01:18:48,439
different plant species due to the leaf

1964
01:18:45,719 --> 01:18:52,399
structures of the plants which makes it

1965
01:18:48,439 --> 01:18:55,519
even more complicated so what they're

1966
01:18:52,399 --> 01:18:58,799
finding and what I have seen anecdotally

1967
01:18:55,520 --> 01:19:02,840
out in the field on multiple crops is

1968
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:05,639
that really smooth leaf plants uh Ficus

1969
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:07,600
croin predatory mites tend not to like

1970
01:19:05,639 --> 01:19:09,440
to want to be on those and so they they

1971
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:11,280
like Doma on the undersides of the

1972
01:19:09,439 --> 01:19:12,479
leaves they like to lay their eggs there

1973
01:19:11,279 --> 01:19:14,479
and so things like cucum mares and

1974
01:19:12,479 --> 01:19:17,519
swerski will tend to leave those crops

1975
01:19:14,479 --> 01:19:19,079
you look at crops like peppers and even

1976
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:21,400
cannabis they've got all those hairs

1977
01:19:19,079 --> 01:19:23,559
they like to be on them so if you're

1978
01:19:21,399 --> 01:19:26,519
targeting a th

1979
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:28,440
species those mites will probably stay

1980
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:30,199
around better on thrips I will stay

1981
01:19:28,439 --> 01:19:32,559
better around better on things like

1982
01:19:30,198 --> 01:19:35,559
cannabis and peppers where when we try

1983
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:38,760
to control that same thrip species over

1984
01:19:35,560 --> 01:19:41,159
on let's say croin or Ficus it might not

1985
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:42,880
work because the mites don't want to

1986
01:19:41,158 --> 01:19:45,399
stay on the plant because of leaf

1987
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:47,719
structure so not only is it getting more

1988
01:19:45,399 --> 01:19:50,000
complicated just does it eat it looking

1989
01:19:47,719 --> 01:19:52,158
at plant structure is making a

1990
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:54,079
difference on management selection these

1991
01:19:52,158 --> 01:19:55,759
days

1992
01:19:54,079 --> 01:19:59,198
I I didn't know that but that makes

1993
01:19:55,760 --> 01:20:03,239
sense when you say it like that um so

1994
01:19:59,198 --> 01:20:05,359
yeah yeah I is there anything else uh

1995
01:20:03,238 --> 01:20:07,399
shall we end yeah I guess so and you

1996
01:20:05,359 --> 01:20:09,519
know hopefully I will see some of you

1997
01:20:07,399 --> 01:20:11,920
around at some of the shows please don't

1998
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:14,320
be shy about coming up and talk to me I

1999
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:17,960
try to be as open as friendly as I can

2000
01:20:14,319 --> 01:20:21,039
and like I said I'll be down um next

2001
01:20:17,960 --> 01:20:23,000
week uh which I don't even know like the

2002
01:20:21,039 --> 01:20:25,319
like the 14th I'm going to be down at TP

2003
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:27,319
in Florida and then um the following

2004
01:20:25,319 --> 01:20:29,759
week I'm going to be up in Minneapolis

2005
01:20:27,319 --> 01:20:31,399
at um there's a big uh Nursery

Greenhouse trade up there and then I'll

2007
01:20:31,399 --> 01:20:36,638
be out at the pr Green Expo um and I'm

2008
01:20:35,399 --> 01:20:39,719
going to be speaking there on mic

2009
01:20:36,639 --> 01:20:41,960
crobial I'm a cultivate every year um

2010
01:20:39,719 --> 01:20:42,800
the bio controls conference which is now

2011
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:45,480
called

2012
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:49,199
biosolutions um I'm going to do a

2013
01:20:45,479 --> 01:20:51,879
workshop at that on uh regenerative Pest

2014
01:20:49,198 --> 01:20:55,158
Management focusing more on a bit more

2015
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:56,800
on outdoor production and talking about

2016
01:20:55,158 --> 01:21:00,198
you know attracting in beneficials

2017
01:20:56,800 --> 01:21:02,199
conservation of beneficials and you know

2018
01:21:00,198 --> 01:21:04,678
sustainability for Pest Management out

2019
01:21:02,198 --> 01:21:07,000
of the bio Solutions conference so I'll

2020
01:21:04,679 --> 01:21:08,800
be out there in California that's I

2021
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:11,039
think I think the first week in March

2022
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:14,320
maybe um I'm going to try to get my

2023
01:21:11,039 --> 01:21:17,000
schedule yeah they dropped their uh they

2024
01:21:14,319 --> 01:21:18,519
dropped their hemp cannabis track I I

2025
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:22,238
honestly kind of have to say I had a

2026
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:24,800
little bit to do with that um because I

2027
01:21:22,238 --> 01:21:26,678
I I will have to say I think the

2028
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:29,119
learning curve for cannabis the Cannabis

2029
01:21:26,679 --> 01:21:34,719
guys have gotten a lot

2030
01:21:29,119 --> 01:21:36,719
smarter um and um have they're getting

2031
01:21:34,719 --> 01:21:39,840
it I mean the the the level of the

2032
01:21:36,719 --> 01:21:42,000
questions I'm getting are much better um

2033
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:44,039
and the Cannabis industry has grown a

2034
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:46,920
lot but I think for the geographic

2035
01:21:44,039 --> 01:21:49,479
location of where the meeting is uh I

2036
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:52,960
think it's the Selenas Valley which is

2037
01:21:49,479 --> 01:21:54,718
mostly big a I didn't think you would

2038
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:56,158
get a lot of cannabis people coming up

2039
01:21:54,719 --> 01:21:58,198
for it but that's not to say cannabis

2040
01:21:56,158 --> 01:21:59,359
people cannot learn from it because

2041
01:21:58,198 --> 01:22:00,960
Michael brownbridge is going to be

2042
01:21:59,359 --> 01:22:03,039
lecturing there Julie grash is going to

2043
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:05,719
be lecturing there I'm going to be doing

2044
01:22:03,039 --> 01:22:08,639
another talk there too so I mean there

2045
01:22:05,719 --> 01:22:10,679
is plenty to learn because you could

2046
01:22:08,639 --> 01:22:12,199
always learn from other Industries and

2047
01:22:10,679 --> 01:22:15,920
learn about all the new products and

2048
01:22:12,198 --> 01:22:18,279
this is really the only bios focused

2049
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:21,480
conference in the US that incorporates

2050
01:22:18,279 --> 01:22:24,359
you know Pest Management bio stimulants

2051
01:22:21,479 --> 01:22:25,759
and biofertilizer

2052
01:22:24,359 --> 01:22:29,399
we're going to put together our own

2053
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:31,199
conference here it's going to happen um

2054
01:22:29,399 --> 01:22:32,599
one of these days and I'm so excited for

2055
01:22:31,198 --> 01:22:35,359
it because there's so many wonderful

2056
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:36,560
podcast guests and between the two of us

2057
01:22:35,359 --> 01:22:38,158
I know we could get some really great

2058
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:41,400
speakers out there yeah no that'd be

2059
01:22:38,158 --> 01:22:44,198
great um I I I think it should be like a

2060
01:22:41,399 --> 01:22:47,198
thing like a festival weekend you know

2061
01:22:44,198 --> 01:22:49,599
and

2062
01:22:47,198 --> 01:22:51,559
um well we needed we need a loc we need

2063
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:54,000
some location so if anyone's listening

2064
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:56,039
to this and knows of a good place that

2065
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:57,560
we could host the meeting preferably

2066
01:22:56,039 --> 01:23:00,119
near some green houses or grows where we

2067
01:22:57,560 --> 01:23:02,440
could do some onsite stuff um that would

2068
01:23:00,119 --> 01:23:04,119
be a good starting point so yeah I love

2069
01:23:02,439 --> 01:23:06,879
doing the Hands-On workshops like I said

2070
01:23:04,119 --> 01:23:11,079
I I just did one in December in Michigan

2071
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:13,760
um with Michigan State um where we went

2072
01:23:11,079 --> 01:23:16,920
through you know beneficial applications

2073
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:18,800
and dipping and washing cuting for pests

2074
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:20,800
and how to Scout and all that and I love

2075
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:21,840
doing those handson things instead of

2076
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:23,880
everybody just sitting in the chair

2077
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:26,400
staring at a screen for a long time so

2078
01:23:23,880 --> 01:23:30,639
yeah having facilities to work at and do

2079
01:23:26,399 --> 01:23:30,638
Hands-On things would be super

2080
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:36,399
awesome that was Suzanne way W Evans and

2081

you were listening to the Cannabis

2082
01:23:36,399 --> 01:23:40,479
