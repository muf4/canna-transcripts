hi guys so something I wanted to talk

2
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:06,160
about today was non-target organism

3
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:07,799
effects it's something that I always

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,160
think about when I'm deciding what

5
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:13,199
product to use in my garden and what I

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:16,879
may be spraying or applying to my soil

7
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:18,759
so for example when I sprayed these

8
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:20,278
plants uh when they were in veg I

9
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,800
sprayed them with mon Monteray

10
00:00:20,278 --> 00:00:24,839
horiculture oil this is also known as SE

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,118
foil X it's an oilbased product there's

12
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:30,480
a lot of oilbased options out there and

13
00:00:28,118 --> 00:00:32,000
they work primarily as a suffocate which

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,600
means the Insight can't develop a

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,719
resistance to it just it's being

16
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:40,359
suffocated now other products that may

17
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:43,640
be applied to the soil to treat fungus

18
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:45,399
gats or some other issue like that could

19
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,960
potentially have non-target organism

20
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:48,719
effects meaning you may be killing the

21
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,120
fungus gats but you're probably also

22
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,480
destroying other biology especially

23
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:54,599
things that are biofumigants so keep

24
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:57,279
that in mind that could damage your

25
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,120
nutrient cycling or perhaps make the

26
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,840
plant or the soil more susceptible to

27
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:02,159
Pest and pathogen

28
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,400
after the

29
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:06,118
application um that's the great thing

30
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,719
about beneficial insects when we apply

31
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:10,200
beneficial insects you know pests can't

32
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:12,478
develop a resistance to that they're

33
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,600
being eaten by the uh by the predatory

34
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:17,000
insects so all things you want to think

35
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:19,199
about always keep in mind non-target

36
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,118
organism effects when you're pick

37
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,159
picking out you know some sort of

38
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:23,719
application that you want to make in

39
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,159
your garden all right thanks for

40
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:26,158
checking
