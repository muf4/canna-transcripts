welcome to the cannabis cultivation and

3
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:22,719
science podcast

4
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:25,038
i'm your host tad hussey of kiss

5
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:25,518
organics this is the podcast where we

6
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:26,960
discuss

7
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:29,038
the cutting edge of growing from a

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,800
science-based perspective and draw

9
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,719
the top experts from around the industry

10
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,439
to share their wisdom and knowledge

11
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,039
my guest this week is dr kevin mayer dr

12
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:38,839
mayer has spent the last five years

13
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:41,200
driving the development of large-scale

14
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,480
micro-propagation programs from cannabis

15
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,879
in north america

16
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:46,479
kevin received his phd in genome science

17
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,439
and technology from the university of

18
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:48,878
british columbia

19
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:50,558
and translate this experience with

20
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:52,000
genetics and plant science to every

21
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:53,919
facet of operations

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,119
product innovation and establishing new

23
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,800
sales channels

24
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:58,238
kevin has established key partnerships

25
00:00:56,799 --> 00:00:59,839
with some of the largest licensed

26
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:01,679
cannabis producers in canada

27
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,440
and the u.s and continues to ensure

28
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:06,319
company execution while driving the

29
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:06,319
industry forward

30
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:09,599
hey kevin thanks for coming on the

31
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:11,599
podcast today

32
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:13,039
thanks for having me yeah let's start

33
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:15,280
off by telling listeners a little bit

34
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,560
about yourself

35
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,159
sure so i uh my background is academic i

36
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,280
got a phd in genome science and

37
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,280
technology which

38
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,560
with the focus on microbial genetics way

39
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,640
back in the day

40
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,159
and uh you know at the time i wasn't

41
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,960
focused on plants but

42
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,640
i was fortunate enough when the early

43
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:34,319
canadian cannabis companies and

44
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,519
licensing was coming online

45
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:40,478
to join an upstart there and really just

46
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:41,438
grew to love plants more than i ever

47
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:44,399
thought i would

48
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:45,599
and dive into this world and and you

49
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,359
know i couldn't be more happy that i'm

50
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:49,599
here now so i've been working

51
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:50,959
in uh in the cannabis space for the last

52
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:52,879
five years and

53
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:54,000
typically you know just focusing on the

54
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:57,280
nursery space and

55
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,359
tissue culture wonderful

56
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,280
wonderful i appreciate you coming on the

57
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:03,840
show i found out about you guys from

58
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,320
suzanne who's a good friend of mine and

59
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,118
uh she recommended that we have a chat

60
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:09,758
so um yeah this isn't a topic that i

61
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:13,039
happen

62
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:15,199
to know all that much about um

63
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:16,318
so i kind of wanted to let you just lead

64
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:17,519
the discussion here

65
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:19,359
do you want to talk a little bit about

66
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,640
what you know tissue culture is

67
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,319
and how it works and sort of what you've

68
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:26,318
what you found

69
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:27,919
sure yeah i mean i'll take i'll take

70
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:30,238
even a bigger step back and just

71
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:31,919
you know touch on we're going to go a

72
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,039
little bit historical here for a second

73
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:34,479
you know just so that everybody knows

74
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:36,159
where this comes from

75
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:38,079
you know there was a there was this guy

76
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:39,359
named godly paverland way back in the

77
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,040
early 1900s

78
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,400
who uh we assume was a pretty cool guy

79
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:42,959
because he was working on this he was

80
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,439
really the

81
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,479
the father of tissue culture and he you

82
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:48,079
know was studying

83
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:49,919
what plants you know what nutrients

84
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,760
particularly micronutrients from soil

85
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:53,679
you know the plants really need to grow

86
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:55,359
and thrive and this really just got

87
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,560
picked up heavily

88
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:01,120
in the 1960s when you know the

89
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,920
the concept of growing plants in kind of

90
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,319
a clean

91
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:06,799
uh environment with very specific

92
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:09,280
nutrients and minerals and sugars

93
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,360
uh could be utilized you know to produce

94
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,439
plants and actually keep them alive

95
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,720
not only just to keep them from dying

96
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:17,359
out you know if something was really

97
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:18,878
challenged or almost going extinct

98
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,280
but actually grow lots and lots of

99
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:23,919
plants very handily so in the 1960s this

100
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,080
really took off for orchids in

101
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:28,399
ornamental flower production and really

102
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,599
just through the 60s and 90s it's

103
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,360
kind of exploded as a you know

104
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:35,199
a way to produce clean plants so you

105
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,760
know plant tissue culture is this very

106
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:37,518
large

107
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:39,199
field that encompasses you know really

108
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,000
any study of plants

109
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:43,919
um growing in a in a specialized media

110
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,639
or nutrient-rich media

111
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:48,238
and within that larger academic world

112
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:49,919
there's the subsection that really just

113
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,158
focuses on

114
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:53,438
clean plant production or you might say

115
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:54,798
clean cloning and that's called

116
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:56,239
micropropagation so

117
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,400
you'll hear a sort of throw around the

118
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,200
term tissue culture and micropropagation

119
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,719
a lot but

120
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:02,479
micropropagation is really the

121
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:03,759
commercial nursery side

122
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:05,518
you know for large-scale plant

123
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:07,120
production within the larger academic

124
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,120
world of tissue cultures so

125
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,959
really i mean any strawberry blueberry

126
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,400
you've had in the last you know 20 years

127
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,840
has actually been produced

128
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,519
or for the most part it's been produced

129
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,918
through tissue culture

130
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,120
and uh you know it's it's critical in a

131
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:21,198
lot of different industries like

132
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,478
potatoes and berries bananas i mean

133
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,639
ornamental flowers

134
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:26,240
and uh and even now complex medicinal

135
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,918
plants companies like dole and

136
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,680
driscoll's you know they they

137
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:32,319
really have taken this technology and

138
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,400
run with it particularly in crops where

139
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:36,478
we're monocropping and viruses start to

140
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:37,918
creep up and cause a problem so

141
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:39,439
that's i'd say sort of the larger

142
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:40,639
history of tissue culture and where it

143
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:43,719
came about

144
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:45,680
and what we do is really focus on on

145
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,440
micropropagation within cannabis and

146
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,160
hemp so hemp type cannabis and thc

147
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:49,439
cannabis

148
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,120
we've got a couple different entities

149
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:53,120
sort of focusing on different different

150
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,000
areas of those two markets

151
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,560
and our goal really is to produce clean

152
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,639
plants

153
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,120
virus-free plants or at least uh you

154
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,800
know as pathogen-free or virus-free as

155
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,079
we can get them particularly with some

156
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,680
of the more well-known viruses that

157
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:08,719
we're starting to identify here

158
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,639
so that growers have a very clean and

159
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,919
healthy plant happy plant going into

160
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,759
production

161
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:15,038
and you know also can scale that

162
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,879
production

163
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:18,879
as they go from maybe their startup

164
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:19,839
phase to a larger you know build out an

165
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:21,360
expansion

166
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:24,638
you know hopefully uh because they're

167
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:28,400
doing really well

168
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:31,600
that's interesting so in the case of

169
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:31,918
cannabis um i've i've noticed that a lot

170
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,759
of

171
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:35,758
people over the last decade have been

172
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,520
talking a lot about tissue culture

173
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,360
i've visited labs that were going to be

174
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:40,000
set up but then i kind of died off i

175
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,199
didn't really

176
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,360
hear a lot of people that were

177
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,280
successfully doing it so it seems like

178
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,879
there's some challenges i know people

179
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:48,399
are now i know it exists

180
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:50,319
but it seems like it was a lot harder

181
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:51,519
than people thought it was going to be

182
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:53,519
what are some of the challenges

183
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:55,599
associated with uh

184
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:58,959
tissue culture that may be you know say

185
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:01,120
more unique to a crop like cannabis

186
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:02,399
sure so yeah it's it's definitely a

187
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,879
challenging plant

188
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:06,079
it you know unlike some other crops that

189
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:08,478
are you know that have been

190
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:09,839
selectively bred for being robust and

191
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:11,680
really you know hearty and different

192
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:13,359
conditions and disease resistant

193
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,199
you know cannabis is really only just

194
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,160
starting to get that kind of

195
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,759
breeding treatment so you know to take

196
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,280
the crop as it exists now and

197
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,240
mass-produce it in tissue culture is

198
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:24,719
very challenging because

199
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,918
because every you know every cultivar uh

200
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,720
is is a little bit different

201
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:29,918
some are you know chock full of diseases

202
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,600
there's also

203
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:33,599
a challenge just knowing what's in the

204
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,560
plant so we you know we deal with

205
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,479
removing

206
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,918
really any bacterial fungal or viral

207
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:40,560
contaminant

208
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:41,839
and when you don't even know what what

209
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,800
some of those are

210
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:45,279
it just makes for a much more

211
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,400
challenging process i mean i think

212
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:48,079
some of the you know i touched on it

213
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:49,038
before where you have this very larger

214
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:50,560
kind of academic

215
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:52,079
side of tissue culture so there's a lot

216
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,918
of people that have really you know been

217
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:55,120
studying plants and tissue culture and

218
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:55,680
tried to apply that knowledge to

219
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,759
cannabis

220
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,439
you know to a degree of success maybe

221
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:02,080
just producing some clean plants or

222
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:03,120
clean mother stock but under in a very

223
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:06,000
uh

224
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,840
lengthy time time frame and you know now

225
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,560
we have some of the large nursery teams

226
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:10,239
that are

227
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,759
you know doing large-scale

228
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,560
micropropagation tens of millions of

229
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,639
plants

230
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,680
plants per year shifting into the

231
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,519
cannabis space

232
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,280
and bringing that sort of large-scale

233
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:20,639
commercial knowledge into it

234
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:22,799
and marrying that with sort of the

235
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,478
academic expertise and i think that's

236
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,598
one of the big differences for why you

237
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:26,318
know a lot of people got really excited

238
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:28,079
about this

239
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,160
it's very expensive and time-consuming

240
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:32,719
to set up and develop a tc lab

241
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,319
you know most companies if something

242
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,759
hasn't really worked out over about 8 to

243
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,039
12 months that's usually the point where

244
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,800
they kind of go okay

245
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:41,120
i don't know if this is really worth it

246
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,038
um but you know if you're kind of coming

247
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,000
from the commercial production side you

248
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:45,439
understand that

249
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,439
you know it could be a couple years of r

250
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:49,199
d just to develop you know the the

251
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:51,199
precise

252
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,800
you know nutrient formula that it takes

253
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,919
to grow these you know each particular

254
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,120
cultivar happily

255
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:58,719
in culture and multiply the plants that

256
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,240
that really i think is what's what's

257
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,840
driving the

258
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,199
the development at least for you know a

259
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:03,918
few of the larger operators in this

260
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,680
space now

261
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:07,359
so it went went quiet for a while i

262
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,918
think there was a lot of hype

263
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,520
and uh unfortunately you know not a lot

264
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:12,478
of execution because i think a lot of

265
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,159
the really

266
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:17,439
experienced commercial teams they

267
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:19,280
weren't really dipping their toes in yet

268
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:20,800
so you touched on some of the benefits

269
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:22,878
of tissue culture

270
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,919
already in the fact that you can remove

271
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,680
you know bacterial

272
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:29,758
viral fungal diseases things that may be

273
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,800
you know systemic in the plant like some

274
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,200
dealing with something that's like

275
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,120
powdery mildew for example

276
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,879
might be something that you could you

277
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,399
could get a clean plant back to

278
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:43,439
uh to a grower but in addition it's also

279
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:46,320
a faster way of getting uh

280
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,160
more plants than than cloning as well

281
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,480
once you have the system set up is that

282
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:52,639
correct

283
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,000
yeah you nailed it i mean there's i

284
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:57,199
could go into the whole you know

285
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,399
there's a whole benefit side of tissue

286
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,120
culture when it comes to plant

287
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,039
performance

288
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,120
and and disease resistance or just you

289
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:06,399
know i guess general health and vigor

290
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,440
um you know plants in in gen i guess

291
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,278
plants that have come from tissue

292
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,760
culture like sugar cane and other crops

293
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:11,360
that

294
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:13,360
you know are really commonly produced in

295
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,480
tissue culture almost across the board

296
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,159
you see

297
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,839
sort of an inherent health and

298
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:18,958
resistance to disease so things like you

299
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,640
might just see an inherent

300
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:22,399
slightly improved resistance to powdery

301
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:24,080
mildew just because the plant is

302
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:27,200
starting healthy it's starting

303
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:30,560
without essentially being coated

304
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,839
in in you know fungal pathogens and uh

305
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:33,838
it's really just going to carry that

306
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:37,519
health through the entire process i mean

307
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:40,160
if you look at um

308
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:42,399
just really every single way that we can

309
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:44,319
produce clean plants i mean

310
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,759
space-wise you know the efficiency of

311
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,040
tissue culture

312
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:49,679
when you look at it compared to

313
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:52,079
conventional cloning takes up

314
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:53,599
maybe 10 of the space and that's you

315
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,160
know that's a pretty rough estimation

316
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,360
but

317
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:59,278
you know in a in a maybe a few thousand

318
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,560
square feet of a lab in tissue culture

319
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:01,600
you know we can produce over a million

320
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:04,159
plants a year

321
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,839
and uh if you were looking at a cloning

322
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:06,879
room a mother space sort of a single

323
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,880
tier

324
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:10,240
cloning space you know you you're

325
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:13,519
definitely not going to achieve those

326
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,839
kind of plant numbers in that space

327
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,639
so take me uh take me through this

328
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,160
process and

329
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:19,919
and one question i had then is you're

330
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,480
not necessarily you're not doing

331
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:24,078
anything

332
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:26,240
to uh modify the genetic

333
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:28,479
makeup of the plant you're just

334
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,278
reproducing it when we talk about

335
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,560
tissue culture is that correct that's

336
00:10:31,278 --> 00:10:34,879
right yeah so we're not

337
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:36,239
so you know within the larger world of

338
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:38,159
plant tissue culture there's definitely

339
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,039
an academic side to it and you know they

340
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:42,399
might focus on

341
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:43,919
on uh you know genetically modifying

342
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,600
organisms but that's that's not really

343
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:47,519
what micropropagation is

344
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,879
you know we're just we're just basically

345
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:52,399
clean cloning

346
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:53,838
in a very uh specific environment that's

347
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,360
a little bit more like a computer chip

348
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,040
manufacturing facility where you've got

349
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,480
no dust particles in the air

350
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:00,559
you know you're working in a very

351
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,399
sterile environment and just

352
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:04,319
uh taking advantage of the plant's

353
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,278
ability to multiply even when it's very

354
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,839
small

355
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:09,200
and produce lots and lots of plants so

356
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:12,079
no we're not we're not impacting the

357
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:15,360
genetics of the plant at all

358
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:18,799
okay so as an organic grower myself

359
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,959
how should i feel about tissue culture

360
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:23,039
in general yeah that's an interesting

361
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:24,958
question you know i think

362
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:27,199
you would you would instinctively think

363
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:29,679
that you know organic production

364
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,800
would would despise or or should not you

365
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:32,799
know feel comfortable with

366
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:33,838
tissue culture but what's really

367
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:36,319
interesting is

368
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,600
that you know there's already a lot of

369
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,959
tissue culture that's used within

370
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,759
organic production which people might

371
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:42,399
not know

372
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:43,919
you know we the strawberry industry in

373
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,639
california the organic strawberry

374
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:46,240
production

375
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:48,879
you know is heavily reliant on plant

376
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,759
tissue culture there's a

377
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:53,519
there's a i should say you know

378
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:56,480
basically there's there's a way that

379
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:58,320
um organic producers can you know source

380
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,240
plant material from tissue culture

381
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,278
labs and it doesn't impact or you know

382
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,399
as long as they're still running it

383
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:03,919
through an entirely organic

384
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,078
process it doesn't doesn't impact their

385
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:08,639
certification i think where

386
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:10,239
the challenge for some organic producers

387
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,759
you know when using tissue culture lies

388
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,519
is in how

389
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:15,200
or what type of hormones you're using to

390
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,200
manipulate the plants so

391
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,639
i'll take a step back when you're

392
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,680
producing plants in tissue culture

393
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,600
they're really going through a few

394
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:23,039
different stages so the first stage

395
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,959
we call initiation is when you're

396
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:27,278
bringing in the plant

397
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:29,039
you're sort of sterilizing it you know

398
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:31,039
cleaning it up sanitizing it just to get

399
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:32,799
rid of any surface pathogens

400
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:34,159
and get it then into a you know a test

401
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:36,319
tube or a glass jar

402
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:37,838
to grow in tissue culture once you've

403
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,959
sort of verified that it's clean it

404
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:39,519
doesn't have any of those problems

405
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:44,000
anymore

406
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:45,278
which can take a while many months you

407
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,039
move the plants into the next stage

408
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:47,600
which is multiplication so you're really

409
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:50,719
just

410
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,720
sort of guiding the plant to

411
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,720
be more bushy sort of like a mini mother

412
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,639
plant really so that you can you know

413
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,160
every few weeks it can it can be

414
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,839
split into multiple plants and you can

415
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:01,039
build a big stock that way the next

416
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,040
stage is really bringing it out of

417
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:04,879
tissue culture

418
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:06,559
and to you know really tell the plant to

419
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:08,720
start rooting so either you're going

420
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:10,078
into a plug set up or you're

421
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,399
you're using a media that tells the

422
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:13,838
plants to using a rooting hormone

423
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,120
and and then you're basically just

424
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,560
hardening the plant outside of the

425
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,519
tissue culture for the last and fourth

426
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:19,039
stage

427
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,240
which we just call acclimation so that

428
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:22,480
would be you know hardening it off in

429
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,519
the greenhouse for example

430
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,320
now in organic production if you're

431
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,480
using

432
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,600
synthetic hormones for example in your

433
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,120
tissue culture media

434
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,720
that might not jive well with an organic

435
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,480
production regime because they're not

436
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,160
naturally derived but there's actually a

437
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,079
lot of tissue culture that can be done

438
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:39,198
even just with naturally derived plant

439
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:40,479
hormones so

440
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:41,919
for example you know you can even

441
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,720
utilize something like a willow bark

442
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:44,639
extract

443
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,040
in a in a tissue culture rooting

444
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,799
procedure that is just naturally derived

445
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:52,639
there's nothing synthetic about it

446
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:53,759
so i think you know organic producers

447
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,198
don't need to be afraid of tissue

448
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:57,679
culture it's not really this

449
00:13:55,198 --> 00:13:59,439
this sterile chemical lab process you

450
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:02,479
know it really can be done

451
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:04,880
really just in a very clean and organic

452
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,800
uh i don't know a compatible way if that

453
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:09,519
makes sense

454
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:10,879
well it does and it doesn't because one

455
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,320
of the things i struggle with is

456
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:14,838
is the fact that it does seem to be

457
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:18,639
quite challenging for a lot of people

458
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:22,000
um to you know to set up a lab and

459
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:24,159
actually get successful plants out of it

460
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,440
so what i'm wondering here is i've been

461
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:28,480
assuming that the

462
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:31,600
media uh culture the cultural

463
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,959
culture medium and then the nutrients

464
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,000
that you're feeding

465
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:36,319
to the plants whatever that concoction

466
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,600
is

467
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,839
that would be you know chemically based

468
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,360
or synthetic and then at that point when

469
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,800
you give the plant back to the grower

470
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,720
they could treat it organically and that

471
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:47,439
doesn't affect the organic certification

472
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,839
but

473
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,440
i mean is there anyone doing this on

474
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,360
scale that's actually using a fully

475
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,360
organic process or do you really believe

476
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,519
that's even possible on scale i mean

477
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,879
i understand i could go and harvest

478
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,679
willow bark and

479
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:02,159
you know access some of the hormones out

480
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:04,479
of there

481
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:05,360
and potentially clone a plant but then

482
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,920
i'm not

483
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,720
i'm not truly getting a clean plant am i

484
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:10,399
i mean

485
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,720
can i can i still go through that whole

486
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,240
process and get a clean plant

487
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,759
yeah sorry so there actually are there

488
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,440
are definitely our groups that are using

489
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:19,360
very you know organic regimes where

490
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,120
everything from everything that they're

491
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,680
utilizing in the plant growth media

492
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:26,560
you know is is sort of uh organically

493
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:28,159
derived materials that are just

494
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:29,838
really just going into media that's

495
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:31,360
producing the plant in a clean lab so

496
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,120
that other external

497
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,639
you know problems paths you know

498
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,320
pathogens and pests can't

499
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,680
get a hold on that plant early well it's

500
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,720
in production so

501
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:41,679
you know one of the other things that i

502
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,278
think really gets me interested

503
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:44,719
where you know i think organic

504
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:46,480
production

505
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,399
can get really exciting here using you

506
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,839
know starting from tissue culture is

507
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:51,440
you know just because you're removing

508
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,199
some of the

509
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,600
the natural you know microorganisms in

510
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:57,359
the plant to get it healthy at the start

511
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,040
there's an opportunity there really

512
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,800
right after that

513
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:02,639
plant is coming out of tissue culture to

514
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:04,000
really introduce

515
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,079
every type of beneficial you know

516
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
organism that you can think of i mean

517
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:09,120
i i you know one thing that we're really

518
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,879
looking at is

519
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,799
you know what are the beneficials what

520
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:14,320
are all the natural you know

521
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:16,958
beneficial mycorrhizal and things that

522
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,879
we can inoculate the plant with

523
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:20,159
early as it's coming out of the really

524
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:20,958
coming out of the greenhouse or out of

525
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:23,120
the lab

526
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:24,638
and so that you know it's it's we're

527
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,959
just taking advantage of nature there

528
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,000
and you're just setting the plant up to

529
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:30,879
you know

530
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,320
really thrive instead of just uh being

531
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:34,159
completely barren of all

532
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,079
i guess microbial life and going out

533
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:39,360
into the you know into the field or the

534
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:41,120
the pod or the indoor setup

535
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,560
oh that's really interesting i never i

536
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,799
never thought of that but you're since

537
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:46,399
you're starting so clean you can really

538
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:48,399
do whatever you want at that point in

539
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:50,720
terms of what you want to introduce

540
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:52,240
to the plant yeah i mean one of the

541
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,959
things we've seen is you know there's a

542
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,480
lot of

543
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:56,559
um i think there's a bit of a

544
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,839
misconception when when somebody is

545
00:16:56,559 --> 00:16:59,359
growing a strain that

546
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,639
you know they've been cloning it for

547
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,480
years and years and years and it's

548
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,160
declining

549
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,599
you know a lot of people will attribute

550
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,120
it to something like genetic drift and

551
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,879
you know often that's not the case when

552
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:10,639
a plant is being cloned serially

553
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,240
over and over and over again you know it

554
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,079
also builds up a lot of um

555
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,318
microorganisms within it you know we

556
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:17,838
that we call endophytes so this is

557
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:19,838
these are microorganisms you know

558
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:20,480
bacterial or fungal that their

559
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:22,240
relationship

560
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,880
with the plant sort of varies from

561
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,318
symbiotic to bordering on pathogenic

562
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,919
and you know the more those build up the

563
00:17:26,318 --> 00:17:29,279
more they can impact the plants vigor

564
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,038
and health and you know what we're

565
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:33,359
seeing is that the plant is declining in

566
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:36,000
terms of either just vigor and yield or

567
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:36,479
potency and you know very often it's

568
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,839
just that

569
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,720
it's been cloned for so long it's just

570
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:42,959
accumulated so many passengers within it

571
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,079
some of them not very good for it that

572
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,679
you know we really need to get rid of

573
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:46,639
them before the plant can come back to

574
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:47,679
it sort of we call it you know

575
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,400
generation zero

576
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:52,320
seed generation vigor and uh you know

577
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,919
tissue culture allows you to do that but

578
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:56,558
i think you know with it with an

579
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,720
emphasis on you know beneficial

580
00:17:56,558 --> 00:18:00,720
organisms right after that you can you

581
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,480
can really not only reset the plant

582
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,038
but then set it up to be as

583
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,400
advantageously colonized with you know

584
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:08,480
stuff that's really going to help it

585
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,759
really going to help it go

586
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,038
yeah i'm really glad you brought that up

587
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:12,960
that was one of the things i wanted to

588
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:15,359
cover because you hear people talk about

589
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,480
you know genetic drift or her genetic

590
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:19,038
exhaustion or

591
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,240
this idea that that clones will degrade

592
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:24,160
over time

593
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:25,359
um i think i think is probably more like

594
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,519
you said the case where

595
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:29,519
it's this this buildup of you know

596
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:30,960
endophytes or

597
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:32,960
you know having a plant that's gone

598
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,400
through a lot of environmental stress

599
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,120
and if people are cloning it you know

600
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,640
off of a

601
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:38,479
stressed mother plant they could be

602
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,720
getting

603
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,079
less vigorous clones it's not

604
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,120
necessarily a reflection

605
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:48,558
of the the genetic material um

606
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:50,639
of the plant itself um so definitely not

607
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:52,160
yeah you know there's there's always

608
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,600
there's obviously the the classic

609
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,080
diseases as well i mean the plant could

610
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:57,279
be

611
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:58,558
you know getting fusarium and and

612
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:00,480
phytophthoric you know could be

613
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:01,599
impacting the the nursery stock so

614
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,200
there's all these other

615
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:04,798
you know root borne and you know fungal

616
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,600
pathogens that can be there impacting

617
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:07,599
the plant

618
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:09,199
that are really hard to get rid of you

619
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:11,038
know fusarium obviously in sort of the

620
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,600
california clone nursery

621
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:14,319
uh it's really just devastated a lot of

622
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:17,839
more the

623
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:19,279
traditional clone nurseries and

624
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:20,959
tissue culture you know allows you to

625
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:21,759
get away from those which you know often

626
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,759
are the problem

627
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:25,279
the other side of it that is a little

628
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:26,798
less understood and we're just kind of

629
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:30,319
really getting into it now is

630
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:32,000
the virus side of it so there's a lot of

631
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:33,439
known viruses right now that impact

632
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,759
cannabis

633
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,798
and we you know we have a pretty good i

634
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:39,119
guess

635
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:40,558
idea of what some of them are we test

636
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:42,079
for we test for viruses

637
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:44,558
uh separately and i think one of my

638
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:45,119
colleagues jack dr jack buns hopefully

639
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:46,879
we'll be able

640
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:48,639
to jump on the podcast and talk a little

641
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,559
bit more about plant viruses but

642
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,000
you know we we test for plant viruses

643
00:19:50,558 --> 00:19:53,839
because we need to be able to show that

644
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,200
the stock we're producing is clean on

645
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:56,798
the other side of it we also just need

646
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,679
to help people identify what the problem

647
00:19:56,798 --> 00:19:58,720
is so

648
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,200
you know they're looking at it

649
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,279
attributing it to maybe genetic

650
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,720
drift like you said but it very well

651
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:06,319
could just be a virus that

652
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,400
you know isn't showing up in a typical

653
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:09,599
virus screen or just something that

654
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,000
they're not testing for

655
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:13,119
so i find it kind of tends to fall into

656
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,880
three camps

657
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:17,038
one being that you just have a buildup

658
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,640
of bacterial and fungal endophytes that

659
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:19,279
are maybe impacting the plant removing

660
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,520
them

661
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:22,960
you know you really see a boost in vigor

662
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:24,798
the other camp being

663
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,400
viruses and you know it's certainly a

664
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:28,558
big issue we're seeing it a lot

665
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,600
on the west coast a lot of obsolete and

666
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:32,240
viroid

667
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:34,158
and the third camp being actual you know

668
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,279
environmental issues or genetic drift

669
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,120
but that's really rare

670
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:38,399
i mean you know if i were to do tissue

671
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:39,678
culture with 100 different plant

672
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,120
cultivars

673
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,960
you know it might only be one or two

674
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:44,959
that are truly aging out

675
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,640
and having a having sort of a either

676
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,798
having a mutation

677
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,759
true mutation that's causing a problem

678
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:52,079
or uh they're

679
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:54,000
they're really aging so um that

680
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:57,359
typically they'll you know fall in the

681
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:00,880
in the pathogen camp so

682
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:03,359
if i was trying to consider genetics to

683
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,880
use in tissue culture what sort of

684
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:07,119
aspects do you look for

685
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,880
in a plant i mean i would assume if a

686
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:10,558
plant is susceptible to

687
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,640
a particular pathogen like powdery

688
00:21:10,558 --> 00:21:13,918
mildew or you know fusarium something

689
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,159
like that

690
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,679
it may not be a good candidate for

691
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,280
tissue culture just in the sense that

692
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,720
yes you can remove it and get them back

693
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:22,158
a clean plant but it's probably going to

694
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,440
be susceptible down the road and have

695
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,919
the same issues

696
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:28,159
later in life i mean what are your

697
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:30,159
thoughts on that

698
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:31,440
yeah i mean it's it's a it's a tough

699
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:32,960
question to answer because i think you

700
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,320
know everyone everyone might select

701
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,919
differently for their own reasons

702
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:38,399
whether it's commercial or just

703
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:39,919
disease resistance you know you all it's

704
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,759
easy to say you should always select for

705
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:43,360
a plant that's disease resistant but

706
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:44,798
disease resistant but you know i we

707
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:46,479
understand the the

708
00:21:44,798 --> 00:21:48,158
complexity of the commercial cannabis

709
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,400
market you know on the retail side

710
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:51,679
and what people are sort of trying to do

711
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,600
and you know there's a

712
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:55,919
there's a demand i guess every year for

713
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:57,759
the new new and what's exciting and

714
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,120
you know that's going to really i guess

715
00:21:57,759 --> 00:22:01,759
clash with traditional

716
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:03,279
breeding right where we're trying to to

717
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:04,319
have very healthy clean plants that

718
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:06,960
we're selecting

719
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:10,079
over multiple generations so it's a it's

720
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,759
a difficult one you know i i think

721
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:13,519
tissue culture at least is a tool you

722
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:14,400
know that i think provides some of these

723
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:15,759
growers

724
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,679
who are dealing with more challenged or

725
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:19,440
pathogen-susceptible plants with a way

726
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,640
to reset their population so you know

727
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,000
even if you weren't producing every

728
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,600
plant through tissue culture

729
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,279
you might be able to reset your mother

730
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:26,558
stock every four to six months from

731
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:28,879
tissue culture

732
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:29,918
so that there wasn't enough time for

733
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,840
something that you

734
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:34,400
knew would probably impact the plant

735
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:37,119
that plant to take hold and cause you

736
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:39,200
real problems

737
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:40,719
yeah this got me thinking from my

738
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,798
conversation with

739
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,240
jeremy plum over a proof about this idea

740
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:47,759
of getting consistent

741
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,319
chemovar expression for like a medical

742
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:50,480
patient

743
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:51,918
you know if you are dealing with a

744
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,798
particular

745
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:56,159
disease or something and you go into a

746
00:22:54,798 --> 00:22:58,319
dispensary and get

747
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:00,640
this particular strain or cultivar and

748
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:03,038
you have a good response to it

749
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,880
you could very well get a very different

750
00:23:03,038 --> 00:23:06,640
uh chemovar expression

751
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,960
going back you know even buying it from

752
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,000
the same grower so

753
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,440
that's one of the things he's been

754
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,558
working on and i think tissue culture

755
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,200
could be an important part of that

756
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:15,839
process

757
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,200
and keeping your genetics consistent

758
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:19,759
over time too

759
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,120
for a medical patient like that yeah i

760
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:22,240
mean i remember jeremy i

761
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:23,599
actually listened to that that

762
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,880
discussion you had to jeremy and you

763
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:26,558
know he was talking a little bit

764
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,720
if i remember he was actually mentioning

765
00:23:26,558 --> 00:23:30,240
how they had the same cultivar grown at

766
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,798
three different environments

767
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,079
and it was a starkly different chemical

768
00:23:32,798 --> 00:23:35,519
profile

769
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:37,199
in all the different environments so how

770
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:39,599
challenging it is even having

771
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,798
you know the same genetics um you know

772
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:42,959
how much they're impacted by the

773
00:23:40,798 --> 00:23:44,879
environment and i think

774
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,440
you know where tissue culture can play

775
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,799
play a role here obviously is

776
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,278
it really i mean it depends how much the

777
00:23:48,798 --> 00:23:52,798
environment is impacting

778
00:23:51,278 --> 00:23:54,640
variable production or variable

779
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:56,079
chemotypes you know of a cultivar even

780
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,960
in the same facility

781
00:23:56,079 --> 00:23:59,918
if you have if you're seeing a lot of

782
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,440
variation

783
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:02,880
and it's caused by you know

784
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,798
environmental things like that tissue

785
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,360
culture might not impact that very much

786
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:08,158
but if it's you know different

787
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:10,000
environments

788
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,600
there in terms of pathogens so this room

789
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,798
is a little more pathogen challenge for

790
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:15,119
powdery mildew or this

791
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:16,400
room you know potentially is developing

792
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:18,558
some viral issues

793
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,919
you know having the consistent stock

794
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:21,278
every time is certainly going to give

795
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:24,159
you a lot more consistency

796
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:25,599
you know so you can get that elusive um

797
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:27,440
you know consistency for the medical

798
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:28,639
patient which everyone is striving for

799
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,720
and i think people are you know

800
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,400
passionately striving for which is great

801
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,480
and you know this this would just be

802
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,440
another tool to ensure that consistency

803
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,919
i mean when you

804
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,200
look at some of the clinical trials that

805
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:41,038
you know really have occurred in lots of

806
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:44,080
different medicinal plants

807
00:24:41,038 --> 00:24:45,759
most of the time you know the project

808
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:46,879
won't even be greenlit unless the plants

809
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:47,278
are coming from tissue culture just

810
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,000
because

811
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:51,679
the typical consistency with that

812
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,038
methodology is just so much stronger

813
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:55,038
than normal cloning or from seed

814
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:58,558
that's interesting i wasn't aware of

815
00:24:56,319 --> 00:25:01,599
that so i guess

816
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:02,879
take me through this process like um if

817
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:04,879
i was a grower

818
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,640
and decided that uh you know i had a

819
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:10,960
really special plant that i wanted

820
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:13,679
to sort of preserve or reset or

821
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,798
cultivate uh in large numbers and i know

822
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,360
this is something i'm going to want down

823
00:25:14,798 --> 00:25:17,519
the road

824
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:18,798
how what does that look like i i assume

825
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:21,038
i would contact a company

826
00:25:18,798 --> 00:25:22,720
like yourselves i would have to give you

827
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:27,119
a certain amount of plant material

828
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:28,640
you know how does this all work sure so

829
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:30,479
it depends a little bit on what the aim

830
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,600
is so for if you're just wanting to

831
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,120
if you're just wanting to store

832
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:35,038
something or bank it so get it into

833
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:36,239
tissue culture for storage

834
00:25:35,038 --> 00:25:37,599
or you're just wanting to get into

835
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,120
tissue culture to clean it up and get a

836
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:40,798
few clean plants back

837
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:43,119
you know that whole process is probably

838
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:44,960
going to take about anywhere from

839
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:47,199
five to eight months assuming that

840
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,480
there's not any major viral challenges

841
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,960
with that plan

842
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,319
so you know we would we would talk to a

843
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,600
company like ours

844
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:55,599
you know we would we would basically

845
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:57,918
coordinate either visiting and

846
00:25:55,599 --> 00:26:00,000
sampling material directly uh having our

847
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:01,759
team do it or providing a you know

848
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
detailed guideline on how to basically

849
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:06,158
provide us with uh just large branches

850
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
or cuttings that we can sample from

851
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:10,559
that can be shipped to us in a sort of a

852
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,558
good way either same day or next day

853
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:14,480
and we would basically harvest as many

854
00:26:12,558 --> 00:26:15,278
you know viable samples off that tissue

855
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,720
as we could

856
00:26:15,278 --> 00:26:18,720
so that we would have you know at least

857
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,319
a couple hundred sort of surviving

858
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:23,038
what we call explants you know so

859
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:25,200
samples in tissue culture now growing

860
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:27,359
without contamination that have survived

861
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,519
kind of the initial cleanup

862
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:30,719
process and you know that all happens

863
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:31,918
pretty quickly you know from the time

864
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,679
that somebody says let's go

865
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:35,759
we can we can show up the next day or

866
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:38,240
within a week and get that going

867
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:39,519
and we won't really know how successful

868
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,038
that plant is initially in tissue

869
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:42,480
culture for a few weeks but

870
00:26:41,038 --> 00:26:45,119
you know after that we're really just

871
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:47,679
taking it through a series of steps

872
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:49,359
you know within kind of the regime of

873
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:51,759
how we grow that planting culture

874
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:52,879
so that it's really just getting used to

875
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:54,798
growing in culture because you know

876
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,240
you're sort of taking plant material

877
00:26:54,798 --> 00:26:58,480
you're telling it to grow in something

878
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,720
without roots right so it has to just

879
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,480
morphologically adapt to that

880
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,919
environment just like any plant would in

881
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,038
a different environment so it takes some

882
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,480
time for the plant to get used to

883
00:27:05,038 --> 00:27:08,640
growing in tissue culture

884
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,079
and then you know then you're driving

885
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,360
the plant to start multiplying so that

886
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:12,798
we can build some stock

887
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:14,798
and then really at that point once it's

888
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:15,038
happy there we could pull clean plants

889
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:16,480
out

890
00:27:15,038 --> 00:27:17,919
you know anytime so if you just wanted a

891
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,440
couple clean plants back we might be

892
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:21,600
able to do that in three four months

893
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,640
if it's just a few plants but usually

894
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:25,599
people want to you know

895
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:27,440
get a couple hundred or at least 100 or

896
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:29,678
at least 50 or a tray back

897
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:31,679
so that they can run some type of trial

898
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:33,440
either put that right into mother stock

899
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:35,360
or get a few in production and do a

900
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,798
side-by-side comparison

901
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:38,639
you know with those plants versus the

902
00:27:36,798 --> 00:27:40,558
plants from traditional cuttings

903
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,480
and we just work with you know with

904
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:43,918
everybody to to find a plan that fits

905
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,360
their needs if they're

906
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,559
wanting to just store the plants at that

907
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:48,158
point you know we would just maintain

908
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:48,720
maybe a very small quantity in tissue

909
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:50,159
culture

910
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,159
but if they're wanting to go and do

911
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:54,080
production so you know they have

912
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:56,159
a room that they want to dedicate or get

913
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:58,798
supplemental clones from us for

914
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:59,200
then it really just becomes kind of a

915
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:00,639
math

916
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,720
and calculations around you know if we

917
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,399
have a thousand plants but they want

918
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,079
three thousand a month and the plants

919
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:07,439
are doubling every month you know it's

920
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:08,879
going to take us a couple extra months

921
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,480
just to get the stock up

922
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,480
and then be able to provide them that

923
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,399
you know 3 000 every month sort of

924
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,399
quantity so

925
00:28:14,398 --> 00:28:18,000
really just there's a lot of weird

926
00:28:16,398 --> 00:28:19,918
calculations that go into it in terms of

927
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,359
figuring out the timelines but

928
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:23,679
for the most part i think you should

929
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:24,959
expect um to be able to get back some

930
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:26,320
clean material if you're putting

931
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,679
something into culture you know within

932
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:29,918
six to eight months

933
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:31,360
if it has viral challenges particularly

934
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:33,520
like obsolete and viroid

935
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:35,199
we usually tell people to anticipate

936
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:36,480
about eight to eight to 11 months

937
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,399
because there will definitely be

938
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,240
additional steps and what we call sort

939
00:28:38,398 --> 00:28:42,079
of deep meristematic culturing where we

940
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,759
might have to culture just from

941
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:45,278
meristematic tissue so for anyone who's

942
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:47,119
not aware the

943
00:28:45,278 --> 00:28:48,960
apical meristematic tissue is sort of

944
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:51,918
the the most

945
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,720
newly forming uh piece of tissue on that

946
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:54,799
plant

947
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,319
so it hasn't really been vascularized so

948
00:28:54,798 --> 00:28:57,679
it hasn't connected to the circulatory

949
00:28:56,319 --> 00:29:00,558
system of the plant yet

950
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:02,159
so it hasn't really been infected by you

951
00:29:00,558 --> 00:29:03,200
know other viruses or pathogens that are

952
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:05,278
in that plant tissue

953
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,519
so if you can sample from that you can

954
00:29:05,278 --> 00:29:09,278
essentially get away from the viral

955
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:10,720
problem just because that tissue hasn't

956
00:29:09,278 --> 00:29:12,480
been infected yet so

957
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,000
you know if you hear about people

958
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,360
talking about tissue culture you know

959
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,960
often you'll hear things

960
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:19,119
uh talk you know you often hear

961
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:21,440
meristematic tissue culture mentioned

962
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:23,359
that's certainly a method to sort of get

963
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,399
clean tissue from a from a mother plant

964
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:25,839
that has a problem

965
00:29:24,398 --> 00:29:27,278
and get away from viruses but it's not

966
00:29:25,839 --> 00:29:29,038
the only way to get or get away from

967
00:29:27,278 --> 00:29:31,278
those problems there's quite a few and

968
00:29:29,038 --> 00:29:33,119
we usually take a parallel approach and

969
00:29:31,278 --> 00:29:35,119
maybe have about three methods running

970
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:36,398
the same time so that we're covered

971
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:38,239
because meristematic tissue culture

972
00:29:36,398 --> 00:29:41,199
takes a really long time it could take

973
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:42,880
10 10 to 12 or more months developed to

974
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,480
develop samples from from aristomatic

975
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:47,360
culture so

976
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,720
yeah i think there's roughly a timeline

977
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:50,558
there that you know i think people

978
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,319
might their eyes might bug out a bit and

979
00:29:50,558 --> 00:29:53,440
go wow that's that's a sticker shock for

980
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:54,158
sure that you know that it's going to

981
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,159
take that long

982
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:58,320
but you know if something is

983
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:59,520
commercially important for you

984
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:01,519
you know you're producing it

985
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:03,119
consistently on a recurring basis

986
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:04,960
you know there's probably an easy case

987
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:06,798
to be made for for getting it cleaned up

988
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:09,120
and having a backup of it and being able

989
00:30:06,798 --> 00:30:11,759
to scale up production clean production

990
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:11,759
if you need it

991
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:16,079
yeah now this got me thinking about one

992
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:17,918
of the challenges associated with giving

993
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:20,319
genetics to

994
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:22,399
a company like yourself or really any

995
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:25,599
company that has the ability to

996
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:27,359
reproduce those genetics or

997
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:30,719
do research on those genetics if i have

998
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:32,479
a special plant that i have you know

999
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,558
ownership over in the sense that i've

1000
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,159
either bred it or

1001
00:30:34,558 --> 00:30:38,158
you know i want to use it in commercial

1002
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:39,919
production in the state

1003
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:41,679
you know i don't want more competition i

1004
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:43,840
don't want other people using this plan

1005
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:44,240
uh what sort of rights and privacy do i

1006
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:46,720
have

1007
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,759
around you know working with a company

1008
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,558
like yourselves or

1009
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:52,158
yourself regarding uh protection you

1010
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:55,759
know essentially ip

1011
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:56,960
of uh whatever plant tissue i give you

1012
00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:58,720
yeah i know ted i'm glad you brought

1013
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,600
that up we it's a question that i get

1014
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,440
every day

1015
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:02,959
you know how to how do how are our

1016
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:06,399
genetics protected and

1017
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:07,120
and what do you do so we we first of all

1018
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:09,678
we

1019
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:11,119
make it very clear and we have contracts

1020
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:13,200
that support this that you know

1021
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:15,199
your genetics are your genetics we have

1022
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,000
no claim or ownership on them we can't

1023
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,159
do anything

1024
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,079
with them we can't do any genomic

1025
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:21,840
sequencing we can't do any breeding we

1026
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:22,798
can't do any cloning without your

1027
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:25,199
approval

1028
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:26,158
um on all of those so there you know i

1029
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,399
think it's

1030
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,919
critical especially within the nursery

1031
00:31:28,398 --> 00:31:30,639
space you know where you are dealing

1032
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:32,399
with

1033
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,919
customers only customers genetics they

1034
00:31:32,398 --> 00:31:34,239
might have bred those themselves or you

1035
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:35,759
know

1036
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,440
done an extensive amount of phenol

1037
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:40,240
hunting to get them and

1038
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,278
uh you know we understand the value

1039
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,720
there is is huge

1040
00:31:41,278 --> 00:31:44,159
especially on the retail side like you

1041
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,159
said if you have something and you don't

1042
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:48,080
want it to be flooding the market so

1043
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:49,840
you know we we take that very seriously

1044
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:52,319
um kind of intellectual property and

1045
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:54,240
protection of our of our customers

1046
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:55,759
and uh you know we make no claims the

1047
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,599
other side of it for us is you know we

1048
00:31:55,759 --> 00:32:01,759
just we don't do any breeding

1049
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:03,119
so if you look at a lot of nurseries

1050
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:07,599
whether they're doing tissue culture or

1051
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:09,038
not i think you know it's very hard to

1052
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:10,959
say that you'll protect a customer's

1053
00:32:09,038 --> 00:32:12,158
genetics if you have a breeding program

1054
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,200
over here where you're you know you're

1055
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:15,039
trying to develop

1056
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,319
and acquire and get interesting

1057
00:32:15,038 --> 00:32:17,359
cultivars so

1058
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:19,119
you know i think that's a really big

1059
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:20,398
piece of it for us is to to make sure

1060
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:22,000
that we

1061
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:24,079
you know not only can show that we have

1062
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,679
you know no interest and no business

1063
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:27,599
developing genetics ourselves we just

1064
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:29,519
want to help people scale and produce

1065
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:31,119
their own

1066
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:32,640
i think that's that's a big piece you

1067
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:33,918
know you might want to look at look at

1068
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,360
the nurseries you're working with you

1069
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:37,519
know if that

1070
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:38,959
if they're developing a breeding program

1071
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:40,640
you know that might be a bit of a red

1072
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,079
flag that

1073
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,320
they're you know there's probably an

1074
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:46,398
incentive somewhere for somebody to

1075
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:48,000
you know even even if it's not uh

1076
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:48,558
something that they want to do where the

1077
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,759
ceo

1078
00:32:48,558 --> 00:32:51,119
will drive you know there's going to be

1079
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:52,480
somebody in the lab somewhere who's

1080
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:54,158
going to be interested in it

1081
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,278
and i think not having a breeding

1082
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:56,960
program just takes a lot of that

1083
00:32:55,278 --> 00:32:58,798
incentive away

1084
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,000
but also the the contractual protection

1085
00:32:58,798 --> 00:33:02,158
of course

1086
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,519
i i think yeah i think you hit on two

1087
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:05,039
things that are from a grower

1088
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:08,240
perspective really concerning

1089
00:33:05,038 --> 00:33:09,278
um one is you know the the idea that

1090
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,720
they're gonna someone's going to do

1091
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:13,440
something with that actual

1092
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:15,759
tissue or those specific genetics but

1093
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,679
also this idea of genome sequencing to

1094
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:20,480
where you can identify

1095
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:20,960
in a genome these specific occurrences

1096
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:24,159
across

1097
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,480
multiple genetics you know you're gonna

1098
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:27,039
see

1099
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,319
thousands thousands of plants um and you

1100
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:30,079
can say hey this is what

1101
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:32,000
seems to be special across all these

1102
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:33,439
plants and then take that

1103
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,119
data and start a separate breeding

1104
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,880
program so i love the i love that you

1105
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:38,319
guys are not doing

1106
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,559
any genetic sequencing without

1107
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:42,079
permission from a grower

1108
00:33:40,558 --> 00:33:43,918
themselves yeah that was one of the

1109
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:44,798
issues you know here in the northwest

1110
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:46,559
that happened

1111
00:33:44,798 --> 00:33:47,918
a couple years ago that you may maybe

1112
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:50,798
you're familiar with too

1113
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:51,200
yeah yeah no we're very aware of that

1114
00:33:50,798 --> 00:33:52,639
and

1115
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,240
i think it was a it was a bit of a

1116
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,720
wake-up call for everybody i mean you

1117
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,640
know one thing i didn't mention we do

1118
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,720
we do have the ability to do a genetic

1119
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,240
fingerprint of things and i think that's

1120
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,679
critical for a nursery for quality

1121
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,319
control you know if i if i go and

1122
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:06,798
produce 10

1123
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:07,359
000 plants i probably should be checking

1124
00:34:06,798 --> 00:34:09,119
you know

1125
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:10,398
that batch as it's going out to just

1126
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:11,760
verify that it was the right plant

1127
00:34:10,398 --> 00:34:12,239
before it goes out and gets grown by

1128
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,520
somebody

1129
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:15,199
this is really typical in like the

1130
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:17,199
blueberry industry and other other crops

1131
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:20,319
that are produced in large scale

1132
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:22,398
but the big difference between doing a a

1133
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:24,559
genotype a very simple genotype and

1134
00:34:22,398 --> 00:34:26,000
doing you know genomic sequencing is

1135
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:28,159
exactly what you mentioned the ability

1136
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,760
to kind of do a deeper dive for

1137
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:31,440
for underlying information potentially

1138
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,520
on what makes that plant interesting

1139
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,720
you know the way we genotype is

1140
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:39,358
completely anonymous

1141
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:39,358
it's it's what's called a sort of

1142
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,480
variable nucleotide 10 and repeat

1143
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:43,598
sequencing which is the same way that

1144
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,320
humans do forensic

1145
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:47,359
genotyping so when you're you know

1146
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,280
looking for

1147
00:34:47,358 --> 00:34:51,199
somebody who matches a sample of hair or

1148
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,919
blood you know you can use

1149
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:54,319
a very kind of basic genotyping method

1150
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:56,719
to

1151
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,920
to figure out that the identity matches

1152
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:59,439
but it's very much like a fingerprint it

1153
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,880
doesn't tell you if that person has blue

1154
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:03,358
eyes or brown hair

1155
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,880
or is really great at producing thc it

1156
00:35:03,358 --> 00:35:07,440
just tells you that this plant

1157
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,000
equals this plant they are the same and

1158
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,119
that's it

1159
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,800
so i think you know that kind of

1160
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:12,160
methodology and maybe understanding the

1161
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,640
underlying technology and

1162
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:16,078
when groups are talking about genomic

1163
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:18,000
sequencing or genotyping

1164
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,280
is really critical so you know the event

1165
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,159
that you talk about in the pacific

1166
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,760
northwest

1167
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:23,440
uh that got really people frustrated you

1168
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,880
know does tie a little bit to the method

1169
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,320
they were using

1170
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:29,039
so you know there's some companies that

1171
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:31,359
do a genetic fingerprint

1172
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:32,960
using what's called a snip profile so

1173
00:35:31,358 --> 00:35:36,078
they have a panel of you know

1174
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:38,720
30 000 individual regions within

1175
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:39,119
a plant genome that create a fingerprint

1176
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:41,759
but

1177
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:42,400
some of those single you know nucleotide

1178
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,880
regions

1179
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,800
can be tied to a gene that actually

1180
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,920
matters and impacts the plant or is

1181
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,519
important

1182
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,960
and you know so they can sort of

1183
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:52,239
potentially derive some information i

1184
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,358
say potentially because i don't want to

1185
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:54,239
infer that they're trying to do that

1186
00:35:53,358 --> 00:35:56,480
they might not

1187
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:58,078
i have no idea but certainly the

1188
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,838
possibility is there to

1189
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:01,359
get functional information from a snip

1190
00:35:59,838 --> 00:36:04,400
panel you know whereas

1191
00:36:01,358 --> 00:36:06,000
a vntr type fingerprint

1192
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,599
doesn't give you any information you

1193
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,159
know really about the

1194
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:11,440
you know any any functional genes within

1195
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:13,679
that genome

1196
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:15,358
that can really provide any useful

1197
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:17,679
information for for things like breeding

1198
00:36:15,358 --> 00:36:19,199
or developing a breeding program so

1199
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:20,159
i realized i went on a bit of a tangent

1200
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:20,960
there but i think it's sort of

1201
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:22,559
interesting for

1202
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,240
for people to understand the differences

1203
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:25,599
you know in genetic fingerprinting and

1204
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:28,319
genome sequencing and

1205
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:29,920
and you know what uh what the downsides

1206
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,760
or risks are with some methods over the

1207
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,920
others

1208
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,680
yeah i'll be the first to admit that i'm

1209
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,240
fairly ignorant on a lot of that stuff

1210
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:37,598
and so

1211
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:39,519
i think one of the challenges that

1212
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:40,079
happened with that you know particular

1213
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:42,159
company

1214
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:44,160
wasn't necessarily they were uh bad

1215
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:46,480
people or bad intentions they just

1216
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:48,159
poorly communicated and then people

1217
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:50,800
didn't fully understand

1218
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:52,799
exactly what the implications were that

1219
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:55,920
were associated with a lot of what

1220
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,839
they were looking to do too so i guess i

1221
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:00,320
see both sides of that story but

1222
00:36:57,838 --> 00:37:01,920
um you know having i think whatever

1223
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,440
company someone decides to work with i

1224
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,358
think having a very frank

1225
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,960
discussion and understanding what rights

1226
00:37:05,358 --> 00:37:08,400
you have as a grower

1227
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,000
is really really important and then

1228
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:12,240
having that contractually

1229
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,280
written up so that both sides understand

1230
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:14,719
what your

1231
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,640
you know what services that are going to

1232
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:18,239
be provided and uh

1233
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:19,679
and all of that so thank you for

1234
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:21,199
explaining that

1235
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:23,440
yeah no problem i mean i think you'd

1236
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:25,679
nailed it just having a really clear

1237
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:27,200
not overly complicated you know

1238
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:29,358
agreement you know we often just call

1239
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:32,319
them material transfer agreements but

1240
00:37:29,358 --> 00:37:33,199
you know ours just is meant to be very

1241
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,039
readable and

1242
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:36,799
really it's all just built to protect

1243
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:39,679
the ip of of

1244
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:41,680
the growers you know we want to just

1245
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:43,759
plant our flag and say

1246
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:45,279
it's yours you know we don't we don't

1247
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,119
want it we just want to help you know

1248
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,480
our our specialty and a lot of

1249
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:50,240
micropropagation tissue culture

1250
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,838
nurseries you know our their specialty

1251
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:53,919
is large-scale production

1252
00:37:51,838 --> 00:37:55,039
so getting really really large number

1253
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,880
numbers of plants

1254
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:58,639
produced in a clean way efficiently

1255
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,640
economically maybe even cheaper than

1256
00:37:58,639 --> 00:38:02,799
traditional cloning

1257
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:04,000
and uh you know we think that's going to

1258
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:07,280
drive the market i mean

1259
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,719
stratification across you know any

1260
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,320
developing crop where

1261
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:11,838
you know right now nursery is internal

1262
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:14,400
for most companies but

1263
00:38:11,838 --> 00:38:16,320
you know as markets develop just like in

1264
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,838
washington and california and a lot of

1265
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,000
a lot of states that have been going for

1266
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:22,078
a while now you start to see

1267
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,519
a nursery side start to develop and and

1268
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:24,320
i think that's going to just continue

1269
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:27,599
you know you're going to

1270
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:29,519
you've already seen obviously processing

1271
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:31,280
extraction separate kind of from

1272
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:32,960
traditional cultivation

1273
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,400
but the nursery side i think is pretty

1274
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:37,358
ripe for that that

1275
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:39,039
uh differentiation where you know we can

1276
00:38:37,358 --> 00:38:40,719
the economy of scale for for us to

1277
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:42,159
produce a lot of clean clones for a lot

1278
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:44,799
of different groups

1279
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:46,799
is just a lot more economical you know

1280
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,160
than than a group doing it themselves

1281
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,359
so i think we think that's really the

1282
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:51,199
way it's going to go because it's gone

1283
00:38:49,358 --> 00:38:51,920
that way in almost every other crop

1284
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:55,358
that's produced

1285
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:56,240
produced clonally so let's talk a little

1286
00:38:55,358 --> 00:38:59,119
bit about

1287
00:38:56,239 --> 00:39:00,719
your company you mentioned the economic

1288
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:02,960
side

1289
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:04,078
so where are you guys what states are

1290
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,880
you guys in currently

1291
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:08,720
and um what are the costs associated

1292
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,800
with this process

1293
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:12,319
sure so we're in washington right now

1294
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:15,599
and we've been in washington

1295
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:16,320
for just just under a year we uh we have

1296
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:18,640
a hemp

1297
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:21,200
nursery hemp tissue culture nursery as

1298
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:22,719
well as a thc cannabis nursery now

1299
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:24,719
um that's been going since since the

1300
00:39:22,719 --> 00:39:25,759
summer and uh i can tell you since the

1301
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:27,679
summer it's been

1302
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,119
we've been kind of bombarded with demand

1303
00:39:27,679 --> 00:39:32,719
and interest in this it's uh

1304
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:34,320
it's really really quite surprising

1305
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:35,598
pleasantly surprising just to see

1306
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,880
you know how many groups were interested

1307
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:38,559
in this and that we might be able to

1308
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,920
help them

1309
00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:41,759
there's a couple different things on the

1310
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:43,440
services side so just you know putting a

1311
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:45,520
cultivar into tissue culture getting it

1312
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,358
cleaned up and getting some plants back

1313
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:48,800
typically that might range because it's

1314
00:39:47,358 --> 00:39:51,279
sort of time dependent it might be a

1315
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:53,359
monthly cost for example

1316
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,400
somewhere in the range of 3000 to maybe

1317
00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:57,519
4 500

1318
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:59,119
per cultivar roughly to get it into

1319
00:39:57,519 --> 00:40:00,159
tissue culture cleaned up and hand it

1320
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:02,160
back to you

1321
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:04,078
and then if you want to continue storing

1322
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:05,598
it or scale it for production

1323
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:07,039
there's probably just a continuing

1324
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:09,039
subscription fee a couple hundred bucks

1325
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:11,199
a month or a few hundred bucks a month

1326
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:12,719
to for us to maintain that for example

1327
00:40:11,199 --> 00:40:14,719
in uh

1328
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:16,239
scaled production we really just at that

1329
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:17,759
point shift to a traditional nursery

1330
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:18,879
model so you know you say i want this

1331
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,240
many plants

1332
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,720
there's a purchase order you're putting

1333
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:24,159
a deposit down and

1334
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:26,719
getting uh you know getting a clean

1335
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:28,318
clone order so many months down the road

1336
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:30,480
so that's a bit more typical

1337
00:40:28,318 --> 00:40:32,239
um you know everybody asked me what what

1338
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,719
what's the clone pricing and

1339
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:35,838
it really does vary by market so you

1340
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:38,480
know

1341
00:40:35,838 --> 00:40:40,239
more developed markets whether they're

1342
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,960
external genetics right so you know if

1343
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:42,719
we

1344
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,318
if we as a nursery have genetics from a

1345
00:40:42,719 --> 00:40:45,919
breeder because breeders do license

1346
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:46,480
genetics to us as a nursery so we

1347
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,240
support the

1348
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,519
you know breeders too if they're trying

1349
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:50,239
to get you know something that they've

1350
00:40:49,519 --> 00:40:53,358
developed

1351
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:54,719
to market at scale we can do that so

1352
00:40:53,358 --> 00:40:57,039
growers can acquire those genetics they

1353
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:58,399
might cost more than than us

1354
00:40:57,039 --> 00:40:59,920
mass producing their own genetics

1355
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,920
because they you know there's no royalty

1356
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:03,519
associated with their own

1357
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,440
and whether it's sort of a one-off clone

1358
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:06,239
purchase versus a recurring clone

1359
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,679
purchase so

1360
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:08,959
i'm dancing around the price question a

1361
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:09,759
little bit but you know just to give you

1362
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,960
a range

1363
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:14,400
it might be you know a one-off might be

1364
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,079
anywhere from like eight to twenty

1365
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:19,358
dollars clone depending on

1366
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:22,160
if it's their own genetics or you know

1367
00:41:19,358 --> 00:41:23,598
a very very exciting new interesting

1368
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:25,358
cultivar from a breeder that has a

1369
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:27,280
massive royalty tied to it

1370
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:28,400
um and and they're really just providing

1371
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:31,200
plants one time

1372
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:33,119
so that the grower can mother off those

1373
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:34,719
if it's recurring clone production

1374
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:36,559
definitely tends to get down you know

1375
00:41:34,719 --> 00:41:37,118
more in like the 48 dollars per plant

1376
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:38,799
range

1377
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:41,039
potentially even getting sub four

1378
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,920
dollars you know if it's very very large

1379
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:43,440
scale

1380
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,440
commercial micro propagation on a

1381
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:47,760
recurring basis

1382
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:49,200
okay good i was gonna i was going to try

1383
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,880
and pin you down for at least some sort

1384
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:51,279
of number range at least so i appreciate

1385
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,519
everybody

1386
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:55,280
everybody does i realize there's a lot

1387
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:58,000
of variables that go into it so

1388
00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:00,000
um you guys are only in washington but

1389
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,440
it sounds like you had plans to

1390
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,199
potentially be in other states are you

1391
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,880
in canada at all

1392
00:42:03,199 --> 00:42:06,480
no no sorry so we're in washington right

1393
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:08,160
now we're active and we'll also be

1394
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,599
active in about six weeks in california

1395
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:12,480
so we actually have that lab

1396
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:14,400
just finishing up it's set up here over

1397
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,280
the next few weeks and we will actively

1398
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,519
be able to

1399
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:19,359
take in samples and work with people

1400
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:20,880
probably about six weeks from today

1401
00:42:19,358 --> 00:42:22,239
so yeah really looking forward to that

1402
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,280
so that would be you know roughly the

1403
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:24,639
last week or the first

1404
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:26,400
last week of july or the first week of

1405
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:27,838
august we'll be able to

1406
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,440
start working with growers in california

1407
00:42:27,838 --> 00:42:32,000
so really excited about that

1408
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:33,440
and you know we we're also really just

1409
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,159
looking to expand into a few other

1410
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,800
states

1411
00:42:34,159 --> 00:42:37,759
you know we can't be everywhere but we

1412
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,760
certainly

1413
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:41,280
have a model where we integrate with

1414
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,800
existing companies in states they're

1415
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:45,280
already licensed and functional

1416
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,318
you know we can come in develop a

1417
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:48,880
nursery division

1418
00:42:46,318 --> 00:42:49,679
under their license and sort of share in

1419
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,280
that

1420
00:42:49,679 --> 00:42:52,639
and they also get access to a lot of

1421
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,839
those benefits so you know if you're a

1422
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:55,358
company that

1423
00:42:53,838 --> 00:42:57,039
is in a different state that's coming

1424
00:42:55,358 --> 00:42:58,559
online particularly you know maybe on

1425
00:42:57,039 --> 00:43:00,480
the east coast for example

1426
00:42:58,559 --> 00:43:01,838
you know we'd love to to chat you can

1427
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,880
reach out to me and

1428
00:43:01,838 --> 00:43:04,799
we you know we'd love to have that

1429
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,640
conversation about how we might be able

1430
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:09,200
to work with you

1431
00:43:06,639 --> 00:43:10,239
very cool very cool so uh here in

1432
00:43:09,199 --> 00:43:13,118
washington state

1433
00:43:10,239 --> 00:43:14,959
you have a medical market that or you

1434
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:16,640
have laws that allow for a grower to

1435
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,159
grow up to 15 plants at home if they

1436
00:43:16,639 --> 00:43:21,679
have a uh

1437
00:43:18,159 --> 00:43:24,239
prescription um and a license uh

1438
00:43:21,679 --> 00:43:26,639
card from the state directly uh so is

1439
00:43:24,239 --> 00:43:28,799
that something you guys support like

1440
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:30,960
you know paying eight to twenty dollars

1441
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,599
for a clone as a home grower for six

1442
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,760
plants or

1443
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:35,200
even 15 plants i'm going to yield a lot

1444
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:36,640
more than i would have

1445
00:43:35,199 --> 00:43:38,239
going you know going down to the rec

1446
00:43:36,639 --> 00:43:39,838
store and buying it

1447
00:43:38,239 --> 00:43:41,439
plus it allows me a little more control

1448
00:43:39,838 --> 00:43:43,039
over the growing process do you guys

1449
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:46,000
support that sort of thing um

1450
00:43:43,039 --> 00:43:47,039
on a smaller scale yeah i mean i'd

1451
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,480
absolutely we're

1452
00:43:47,039 --> 00:43:50,159
you know i'm glad you brought it up

1453
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,599
we're you know we're in discussion about

1454
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:52,719
how we can do that we want to be able to

1455
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:54,160
support home

1456
00:43:52,719 --> 00:43:56,000
you know medical patients and people who

1457
00:43:54,159 --> 00:43:57,440
are growing at home i think the

1458
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,119
challenge for us is we just don't have

1459
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:00,720
the bandwidth to have you know deal with

1460
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:02,079
a lot of microtransactions so what we're

1461
00:44:00,719 --> 00:44:03,118
really trying to do is partner with

1462
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:05,599
retailers

1463
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:07,280
who can sort of set up all of the

1464
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:09,039
transactions with uh

1465
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:11,200
you know with with the home growers and

1466
00:44:09,039 --> 00:44:12,880
then facilitate a larger order from us

1467
00:44:11,199 --> 00:44:14,318
um just so that we can we can do that

1468
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:16,079
and then people can you know we can just

1469
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:18,000
coordinate uh local pickup for those

1470
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:19,519
for those people that that need that and

1471
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,719
i would absolutely love to be able to do

1472
00:44:19,519 --> 00:44:21,440
that we're you know we're still fairly

1473
00:44:20,719 --> 00:44:22,959
new and

1474
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:25,599
a lot of the groups we're working with

1475
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:27,920
are our large

1476
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:29,280
wreck growers right now so you know

1477
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,639
they're taking a lot of our bandwidth

1478
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:33,119
certainly as they expand

1479
00:44:30,639 --> 00:44:34,318
but you know i we we never forget about

1480
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:35,838
you know wanting to help out medical

1481
00:44:34,318 --> 00:44:38,559
patients when we can and i think that's

1482
00:44:35,838 --> 00:44:40,960
sort of the way we'll be able to do it

1483
00:44:38,559 --> 00:44:42,799
yeah it's such a challenge for uh

1484
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:43,838
medical patients to get clean clones

1485
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,440
because of

1486
00:44:43,838 --> 00:44:47,199
the fact you know you you have plant

1487
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,559
limits you really can't do a ton of

1488
00:44:47,199 --> 00:44:49,838
cloning yourself because

1489
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:51,599
of the number of plants you're allowed

1490
00:44:49,838 --> 00:44:53,440
to have and then when you go out and get

1491
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:56,559
you want to acquire new genetics or get

1492
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:58,480
new plants if you don't grow from seed

1493
00:44:56,559 --> 00:44:59,838
the chances of bringing in hemp russet

1494
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:01,119
and some of these other you know the

1495
00:44:59,838 --> 00:45:04,400
cannabis aphid

1496
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:05,680
are really really high so i love the

1497
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:08,880
idea of starting from

1498
00:45:05,679 --> 00:45:10,159
uh you know tissue culture plants

1499
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,680
you know even at twenty dollars a clone

1500
00:45:10,159 --> 00:45:12,159
that's not that's kind of the market

1501
00:45:11,679 --> 00:45:14,000
rate

1502
00:45:12,159 --> 00:45:16,078
for clones in a lot of ways so you're

1503
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,880
not really that uh that high

1504
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:20,240
uh surprisingly yeah i mean the the you

1505
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,358
know the prices i'm i'm talking about

1506
00:45:20,239 --> 00:45:23,358
are you know typically like

1507
00:45:21,358 --> 00:45:24,719
large-scale wholesale kind of production

1508
00:45:23,358 --> 00:45:26,159
for for commercial growers

1509
00:45:24,719 --> 00:45:27,439
i mean i think i think the you know the

1510
00:45:26,159 --> 00:45:28,480
retailer is probably going to tack on

1511
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,838
what they tack on and

1512
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:32,000
i think the number i've heard is you

1513
00:45:29,838 --> 00:45:33,440
know whatever whatever the typical

1514
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,119
cult you know prices directly for a

1515
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:36,720
cultivator it's usually going to end up

1516
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:38,000
being about three times that by the time

1517
00:45:36,719 --> 00:45:40,480
it gets

1518
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,400
to retail but yeah i think you know

1519
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:44,159
ideally we can we can target

1520
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:46,079
um some cultivars that you know maybe we

1521
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:47,759
already produce that we can provide at

1522
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:49,920
as little cost as possible for those

1523
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:51,359
for those home growers all right fair

1524
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:54,559
enough fair enough

1525
00:45:51,358 --> 00:45:55,199
um well uh that was sort of it for the

1526
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:56,960
questions

1527
00:45:55,199 --> 00:45:58,480
i had regarding tissue culture i really

1528
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:59,838
appreciate you uh

1529
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,800
you know taking their time today to

1530
00:45:59,838 --> 00:46:02,159
answer some of them why is there

1531
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,880
anything else that you wanted to add

1532
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:06,399
before we uh sign off

1533
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:08,240
yeah i think the only thing i'd want to

1534
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:10,240
leave people with is to to maybe just

1535
00:46:08,239 --> 00:46:12,479
shift their thinking a little bit around

1536
00:46:10,239 --> 00:46:16,078
you know how a facility is laid out in

1537
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:17,599
in cultivation where you know right now

1538
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:19,359
the internal nursery side of the

1539
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:21,119
business you know maybe takes up

1540
00:46:19,358 --> 00:46:22,318
anywhere from 10 to 25 percent of the

1541
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:24,559
facility space

1542
00:46:22,318 --> 00:46:25,920
certainly takes a lot of bandwidth and

1543
00:46:24,559 --> 00:46:27,838
and

1544
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:30,159
personnel and there's a lot of costs and

1545
00:46:27,838 --> 00:46:32,400
challenges around clone production

1546
00:46:30,159 --> 00:46:34,239
and you know what would that look like

1547
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:36,079
if you know you didn't have to produce

1548
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:37,358
any clones yourself all of that space

1549
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:39,599
could be dedicated to

1550
00:46:37,358 --> 00:46:41,519
flowering you know well you know

1551
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:42,000
additional veg space but also just more

1552
00:46:41,519 --> 00:46:43,920
flowering

1553
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,358
space you know how would that impact

1554
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:47,680
your business right if you

1555
00:46:45,358 --> 00:46:49,679
if you could take the space you have and

1556
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:52,078
you know generate 10 20 30

1557
00:46:49,679 --> 00:46:53,919
more revenue generating product from

1558
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:55,920
that and i think it's a

1559
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:57,119
it's a weird shift for people just to

1560
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:59,200
think about losing

1561
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:00,800
what you know what feels like a piece of

1562
00:46:59,199 --> 00:47:01,199
a piece of the whole entity you know

1563
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:04,318
that

1564
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:06,000
the facility is but you know

1565
00:47:04,318 --> 00:47:07,519
take a look at other industries and

1566
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,880
maybe don't be so scared of the idea

1567
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:11,280
that you know maybe working with a

1568
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:13,599
dedicated external nursery

1569
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:14,640
slowly not all you know not not 100 to

1570
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:16,079
start but

1571
00:47:14,639 --> 00:47:18,239
you know supplementing your existing

1572
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:19,760
clone stock taking over some of your

1573
00:47:18,239 --> 00:47:21,358
clone production even if they can do it

1574
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:23,760
cheaper or on par with what you're doing

1575
00:47:21,358 --> 00:47:24,960
and expand your production capacity

1576
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:28,000
you know maybe that's a different way to

1577
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:29,199
think about things and maybe that

1578
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,358
might be something that's worth taking a

1579
00:47:29,199 --> 00:47:33,039
look at that's a

1580
00:47:31,358 --> 00:47:34,639
that's a really interesting point

1581
00:47:33,039 --> 00:47:35,119
thinking about how you know the amount

1582
00:47:34,639 --> 00:47:38,879
of

1583
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:42,079
labor stress uh workflow

1584
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:45,358
crop risk uh you know

1585
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:46,720
chances of not having a clean plant all

1586
00:47:45,358 --> 00:47:49,039
of those things that come in

1587
00:47:46,719 --> 00:47:50,879
with a traditional cloning method that

1588
00:47:49,039 --> 00:47:53,920
we're also used to using in

1589
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:56,480
in facilities it is a little bit of a

1590
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:57,680
of a mental shift to consider some of

1591
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:00,240
these other options so i'm glad you

1592
00:47:57,679 --> 00:48:00,239
brought that up

1593
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:03,920
yo glad we could chat about this thanks
