thank you so can we start off giving

39
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:42,450
listeners a little bit of your

40
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:47,819
background yeah sure so I I come from

41
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:50,570
sort of a very broad background for you

42
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:54,209
know sort of formal education wise I

43
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:57,089
have degrees in biology and Natural

44
00:01:54,209 --> 00:01:59,368
History and graduate degree in a field

45
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:01,700
that's called environmental planning

46
00:01:59,368 --> 00:02:06,359
which is sort of a sub-discipline of

47
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:09,090
landscape architecture and so that's

48
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:12,330
that's kind of my formal training and I

49
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:14,000
have to say it's no surprise that I have

50
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:16,650
ended up

51
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,610
enamored with the botanical world

52
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:24,680
because of all of those things one of my

53
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:29,280
earliest memories as a kid I grew up in

54
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:31,530
the suburbs outside of Denver and one of

55
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,459
my earliest memories was wandering

56
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:37,560
around in our yard because you did that

57
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:39,688
when I was a kid there were no screens

58
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:42,569
or anything like that so what you did

59
00:02:39,688 --> 00:02:45,598
was you went outside and you explored

60
00:02:42,568 --> 00:02:49,858
the world and to me as a little kid the

61
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:54,509
yard was you know plenty big as a four

62
00:02:49,859 --> 00:02:57,930
or five year old so here it was early

63
00:02:54,509 --> 00:03:01,438
June you know memories of cold and snow

64
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:03,359
or dim in my mind but the garden the

65
00:03:01,438 --> 00:03:05,158
garden hadn't really quite woken up but

66
00:03:03,359 --> 00:03:08,849
I have to say this my parents were not

67
00:03:05,158 --> 00:03:10,709
like green some kind of people there was

68
00:03:08,848 --> 00:03:14,188
no big gardening history or anything

69
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:16,469
like that in my family but they had put

70
00:03:14,188 --> 00:03:19,459
plants in and they had established a

71
00:03:16,469 --> 00:03:22,378
couple of small rock gardens within the

72
00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:25,739
larger yard and I remember walking

73
00:03:22,378 --> 00:03:28,858
around to the back the back of the yard

74
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:31,560
one day and I was looking down at these

75
00:03:28,859 --> 00:03:33,269
iris rhizomes and you know how ugly

76
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:37,979
those things look they look like a piece

77
00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:40,859
of ginger and then I followed the stock

78
00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:43,439
up and there was this flower that I just

79
00:03:40,859 --> 00:03:46,859
could not believe that it had come out

80
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:48,810
of that gnarly you know dead looking

81
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:51,239
rhizome thing and so that's what I

82
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:52,979
credit with sort of the beginning the

83
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:59,099
beginning of what I now call a pretty

84
00:03:52,979 --> 00:04:01,979
bad case of plant lust on my part I I've

85
00:03:59,098 --> 00:04:06,238
always I've just always enjoyed being

86
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:08,970
around plants and growing plants and and

87
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:11,128
again in Colorado you can't you know now

88
00:04:08,969 --> 00:04:13,530
I live in Seattle so we've got you know

89
00:04:11,128 --> 00:04:16,589
pretty you know year-round growing

90
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:18,899
season for many things here Colorado

91
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:21,718
that was not the case so what I did was

92
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:23,668
I commandeered this very large table in

93
00:04:21,718 --> 00:04:26,769
our living room and I started filling it

94
00:04:23,668 --> 00:04:30,128
up with plants all different kinds of

95
00:04:26,769 --> 00:04:32,649
plants and that was that was how I sort

96
00:04:30,129 --> 00:04:35,139
of satisfied my my green thumb and my

97
00:04:32,649 --> 00:04:38,439
plant lust as I got to be older and

98
00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:40,960
figured out you know how to plant a

99
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:45,219
plant how to watch it grow and how to

100
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:48,089
take care of it and so on one of the the

101
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:50,919
things that I have always done though it

102
00:04:48,089 --> 00:04:53,138
you know whenever you know one time once

103
00:04:50,918 --> 00:04:54,848
I moved out of home and went to college

104
00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:56,710
and stuff like that right you start

105
00:04:54,848 --> 00:05:00,279
renting places and what are the yards in

106
00:04:56,709 --> 00:05:02,109
most of these places that anybody rents

107
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:04,119
sort of look you know they're kind of

108
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:06,280
cruddy they're just there's not much

109
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,840
there most of the time and it's about

110
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:10,719
the last thing that a landlord really

111
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:12,818
wants to take care of so I sort of cut

112
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,009
my teeth on gardening at a lot of

113
00:05:12,819 --> 00:05:19,810
different rental places over the years

114
00:05:15,009 --> 00:05:24,939
and what was good about that is I think

115
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:27,629
growing plants is it's definitely one of

116
00:05:24,939 --> 00:05:30,668
those trial and error kind of

117
00:05:27,629 --> 00:05:33,250
experiences some things work out and

118
00:05:30,668 --> 00:05:35,519
some things don't and a plant will let

119
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:38,288
you know you know pretty much right away

120
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:40,529
if it's if you're doing the right things

121
00:05:38,288 --> 00:05:43,240
and if you're doing the wrong things

122
00:05:40,529 --> 00:05:45,329
yeah yeah I think that's great and so

123
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,860
then you moved out to Seattle and

124
00:05:45,329 --> 00:05:49,718
established your own garden I know you

125
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:51,939
talked about it in the beginning of the

126
00:05:49,718 --> 00:05:54,370
Hidden half of nature which you wrote

127
00:05:51,939 --> 00:05:56,560
with with David can you talk a little

128
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:59,139
bit about that experience with I know

129
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,629
you focused there on mulching and and he

130
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:03,519
had some unique perspectives from a

131
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:05,680
geological perspective on how quickly

132
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:08,889
you're able to build the soil in your

133
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:11,050
yard yeah yeah yeah sure it's funny

134
00:06:08,889 --> 00:06:14,319
because it was about this time some

135
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:15,579
years ago that we really that we got

136
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:19,090
going so we had bought a house in

137
00:06:15,579 --> 00:06:20,228
Seattle years ago and part of what drew

138
00:06:19,089 --> 00:06:22,119
us today and this is in the middle of

139
00:06:20,228 --> 00:06:24,848
the city pad you know this is not like

140
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,769
some extra large lot or something like

141
00:06:24,848 --> 00:06:30,240
that so we're in the middle of Seattle

142
00:06:26,769 --> 00:06:32,318
and what originally drew us to the house

143
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,000
remember we looked at the house in

144
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,098
February and so at that time of year

145
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,649
there's there's early February

146
00:06:36,098 --> 00:06:40,269
there's not much going on but you know I

147
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:42,850
could see that there were

148
00:06:40,269 --> 00:06:44,740
couple of trees you know obviously at

149
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:47,260
that time of year the all lawns in

150
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:50,110
Seattle are you know yeah that emerald

151
00:06:47,259 --> 00:06:52,839
green color and and and what really

152
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:57,009
attracted me was it the house is built

153
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:59,739
on once it's it's was built on one side

154
00:06:57,009 --> 00:07:03,339
of the lot and so that left the other

155
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:06,850
side of the lot really largely a blank

156
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:12,429
slate and I saw that and you know I just

157
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:14,740
had I had plants plants adorning my

158
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:16,629
eyeballs that was like all I saw was oh

159
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:21,670
man the garden potential here I've never

160
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:23,860
seen anything anything like this so we

161
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:26,680
didn't get get going on the garden quite

162
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:28,720
as soon as as we wanted we sort of had

163
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:31,449
some fixer-upper stuff to do inside of

164
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,920
the house and what's what's what's kind

165
00:07:31,449 --> 00:07:35,129
of humorous at this point it was

166
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:39,250
definitely not funny at the time is that

167
00:07:35,129 --> 00:07:43,360
once we did break ground to to do the

168
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:45,339
garden we began with sort of very unlike

169
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,740
today where people are demolishing

170
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:49,719
houses left and right around here we

171
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:51,189
didn't demolish the house we started

172
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:55,870
demolished everything that was out in

173
00:07:51,189 --> 00:07:59,230
the yard and by that I mean as it turned

174
00:07:55,870 --> 00:08:00,939
out the the trees that had looked alive

175
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:05,470
at least a couple of them were actually

176
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:07,089
dead and so so the first order of

177
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:10,330
business was to remove these couple of

178
00:08:07,089 --> 00:08:13,419
dead trees there was a tree that's

179
00:08:10,329 --> 00:08:15,579
called a horse chestnut that was

180
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:18,730
engulfing one side of the house and so

181
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:20,620
we removed that oh god and then there

182
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:22,840
was a mulberry tree that actually had

183
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:25,660
wonderful mulberries in the summer but

184
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:28,389
in the winter time it looked horrible

185
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:30,939
somebody had previously topped that tree

186
00:08:28,389 --> 00:08:33,429
like about you know no less than ninety

187
00:08:30,939 --> 00:08:37,870
nine times it looked like this Medusa

188
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:39,549
head and so anyway we got we we got the

189
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:41,049
stuff out of there that and it was

190
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:45,699
nearly everything because there was

191
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:47,919
really never to my eye anyway anyone who

192
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:50,170
had seriously gardened here at all it

193
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:51,000
was when we looked into the history of

194
00:08:50,169 --> 00:08:53,998
house it was

195
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,789
Norwegians the austere Berg's who had

196
00:08:53,999 --> 00:08:59,050
bought this lot and built the house and

197
00:08:56,789 --> 00:09:01,958
think like a lot of people in this

198
00:08:59,049 --> 00:09:04,419
region they at least at that time anyway

199
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:07,208
whatever blew in on the rain and the

200
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:11,558
wind that's what your yard was made of

201
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:14,378
so so the long and short of it is we got

202
00:09:11,558 --> 00:09:16,808
everything cleared and we were doing

203
00:09:14,379 --> 00:09:18,220
this you know as that summer progressed

204
00:09:16,808 --> 00:09:19,659
as we were putting the garden and you

205
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:21,910
know we started like I said it was

206
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:23,889
around well actually it was Memorial Day

207
00:09:21,909 --> 00:09:27,669
weekend that's right because the guy was

208
00:09:23,889 --> 00:09:29,649
supposed to show up the Friday before

209
00:09:27,669 --> 00:09:32,139
Memorial Day weekend and it had been put

210
00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:33,938
off numerous times that this guy was

211
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:36,789
going to start and I remember just

212
00:09:33,938 --> 00:09:38,828
laughing and Dave and I saying oh right

213
00:09:36,789 --> 00:09:41,618
somebody's going to show up the Friday

214
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:46,568
before Memorial Day weekend to start on

215
00:09:41,619 --> 00:09:48,428
a large job so we didn't be the guide

216
00:09:46,568 --> 00:09:50,948
cancelled so many times we were so

217
00:09:48,428 --> 00:09:53,019
surprised then when somebody his name

218
00:09:50,948 --> 00:09:55,868
was Jim and he walked up the driveway

219
00:09:53,019 --> 00:09:59,230
with a chainsaw and that's all he had

220
00:09:55,869 --> 00:10:04,360
and he all he said was names Jim piers

221
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:08,889
start the job oh that day Jim let loose

222
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:11,199
he was a he had been a logger previously

223
00:10:08,889 --> 00:10:14,379
so you know a handle a chainsaw you know

224
00:10:11,198 --> 00:10:18,519
how to take all the stuff out and within

225
00:10:14,379 --> 00:10:21,550
about three or four hours our place

226
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:24,730
looks like a moonscape and I completely

227
00:10:21,549 --> 00:10:26,229
freaked out and I thought oh my god is

228
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:28,808
this really what we want this place

229
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:34,089
looks horrible there's not a stitch of

230
00:10:28,808 --> 00:10:36,039
green left and some bare spots soil

231
00:10:34,089 --> 00:10:39,749
we're starting to emerge and it only got

232
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:42,278
worse from there tad because we took

233
00:10:39,749 --> 00:10:43,298
like this is about a month later or so

234
00:10:42,278 --> 00:10:45,458
you know there was like a small

235
00:10:43,298 --> 00:10:48,120
bulldozer thing driving around on the

236
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:50,289
lot doing leveling and this and that and

237
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:54,129
by that time of year

238
00:10:50,289 --> 00:10:56,169
the lot our soil just I realized Dave

239
00:10:54,129 --> 00:10:58,028
wasn't he wasn't you know he doesn't

240
00:10:56,169 --> 00:11:00,308
need mammogram come to him it was like

241
00:10:58,028 --> 00:11:03,159
dirt is dirt is dirt to me though I

242
00:11:00,308 --> 00:11:05,678
thought oh man this is looking worse and

243
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:07,639
worse the soils getting like lighter

244
00:11:05,678 --> 00:11:11,419
colored by the day the

245
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:13,659
rocks seem to be breeding and how is

246
00:11:11,419 --> 00:11:15,740
this ever going to grow anything and

247
00:11:13,659 --> 00:11:19,879
worst of all we got

248
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:22,789
we ended up planting you know many of

249
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:24,320
the plants that that I had because I'd

250
00:11:22,789 --> 00:11:25,669
been sort of stockpiling them for the

251
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,730
last couple of years and they really

252
00:11:25,669 --> 00:11:31,099
wanted to get out of their pots so we

253
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:33,830
start planting them and then we run into

254
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:36,620
the dreaded glacial till which is all

255
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:38,360
over Seattle the glacial till is this

256
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:43,429
hard pan layer it's almost as though

257
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:46,399
somebody snuck in back in time poured

258
00:11:43,429 --> 00:11:48,589
concrete all over the place about 8 10

259
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:51,620
12 inches down and then they put the

260
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:54,080
soil back on top and so we'd hit this

261
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:57,710
hard pan with a shovel and it was just

262
00:11:54,080 --> 00:12:02,480
like I broke my elbow broke my wrist on

263
00:11:57,710 --> 00:12:05,810
that stuff and what this so we had that

264
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,700
was one problem and with just what had

265
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:10,009
happened on the lot over the years there

266
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:11,980
was no there was not any really organic

267
00:12:10,009 --> 00:12:16,189
matter buildup because there were really

268
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:22,519
not many sources of organic matter at

269
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:25,250
all and so I so I'm asked I'm sort of

270
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:28,879
this guy bringing on PTSD or something

271
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:30,139
oh I remembered also the other big

272
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:32,779
problem at that time of year is like

273
00:12:30,139 --> 00:12:34,580
water I'm like God we are you know I was

274
00:12:32,779 --> 00:12:36,049
cursing the Landscape Architect oh my

275
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:38,870
god I can't believe we're out here

276
00:12:36,049 --> 00:12:40,969
middle of August you know there's a

277
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:43,100
water shortage on the Cedar River and at

278
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:44,990
the time I worked in the water or in

279
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:47,000
salmon field and I'm like I'm just

280
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:51,250
killing salmon trying to you know keep

281
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:53,870
these plants alive and what I knew from

282
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:56,090
you know previous short short-term

283
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:57,500
gardening things that I had done you

284
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:59,269
know at these various places that we had

285
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:01,970
rented I'm like I gotta get some organic

286
00:12:59,269 --> 00:13:05,029
matter and I just get organic matter and

287
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:07,759
bring it and just layer it on top of the

288
00:13:05,029 --> 00:13:10,610
soil because that is going to cut down

289
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:13,789
on the watering first of all so I

290
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:15,950
scramble around for much of that August

291
00:13:13,789 --> 00:13:19,459
and into the months of you know

292
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:21,600
September through December in the early

293
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:23,278
the next winter

294
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,069
getting any kind of free and cheap

295
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:29,578
organic matter that I could and bringing

296
00:13:26,068 --> 00:13:35,610
it home and layering it on top of the

297
00:13:29,578 --> 00:13:39,419
beds and it felt there's just something

298
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:41,278
really satisfying to me when especially

299
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:42,328
after having going gone through that

300
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:46,169
sort of you know somewhat traumatic

301
00:13:42,328 --> 00:13:49,349
experience to mixing up just a really

302
00:13:46,169 --> 00:13:52,500
nice mulch that has like you know at

303
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:56,069
least two maybe three or four different

304
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:57,839
kinds of organic matter and it's a nice

305
00:13:56,068 --> 00:14:00,448
texture and there's a nice moisture

306
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:05,300
level to it and just laying it out on

307
00:14:00,448 --> 00:14:08,429
the beds and I sort of feel like it's

308
00:14:05,299 --> 00:14:11,219
everything's just taken care of and I

309
00:14:08,429 --> 00:14:14,120
can walk away and I can let the green

310
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:17,399
bodies of all the plants in the garden

311
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:18,810
just do what they know how to do because

312
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:21,389
I there's there's definitely one thing

313
00:14:18,809 --> 00:14:23,719
I've learned in putting this garden in

314
00:14:21,389 --> 00:14:26,100
and taking care of it over the years is

315
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:29,449
all of us gardeners and I don't care if

316
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:32,310
you're growing cannabis or other things

317
00:14:29,448 --> 00:14:34,318
although I definitely understand the

318
00:14:32,309 --> 00:14:35,969
tendency with cannabis is intervention

319
00:14:34,318 --> 00:14:37,409
intervention we gotta you know we're

320
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:40,379
trying to grow this stuff it's a cash

321
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:44,938
crop and so on and so forth but I really

322
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:46,970
have come to see over the years that if

323
00:14:44,938 --> 00:14:52,438
you just give plants what they need

324
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:55,528
their their bodies really know how to

325
00:14:52,438 --> 00:14:57,419
how to take care of themselves and it's

326
00:14:55,528 --> 00:15:02,299
when we get in and start mucking things

327
00:14:57,419 --> 00:15:05,009
up that it starts mucking up the way

328
00:15:02,299 --> 00:15:07,740
that a plant's green body works and then

329
00:15:05,009 --> 00:15:10,829
we run into you know pest problems or we

330
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:13,379
run into various other things and then

331
00:15:10,828 --> 00:15:15,000
that turns into sort of a feedback loop

332
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:16,500
where then we have to jump in with some

333
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,159
other intervention to take care of the

334
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:23,639
first intervention that we caused so

335
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:26,789
that's definitely something I've seen in

336
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:30,209
my own garden especially as plants

337
00:15:26,789 --> 00:15:32,730
mature and the trees in particular a

338
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:35,219
tree is just a really amazing thing

339
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:37,980
because the

340
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:41,699
it grows and as it begins to mature it

341
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:44,039
becomes in in sort of normal situations

342
00:15:41,698 --> 00:15:45,750
it becomes better and better equipped to

343
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:48,028
take care of itself because it's

344
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:52,019
dropping these loads of organic matter

345
00:15:48,028 --> 00:15:55,528
in the form of leaves on on top of the

346
00:15:52,019 --> 00:16:00,509
ground and it's the perfect kind of

347
00:15:55,528 --> 00:16:02,399
plant food for the tree itself so you

348
00:16:00,509 --> 00:16:06,919
know I'm still so that that's sort of

349
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:10,198
the story of the garden and how it was

350
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:15,750
really by returning organic matter to

351
00:16:10,198 --> 00:16:18,179
the soil that that I feel like it got it

352
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:21,688
got our garden off to a good start and

353
00:16:18,179 --> 00:16:24,419
it really saved it really saved our

354
00:16:21,688 --> 00:16:28,188
butts that first does that first couple

355
00:16:24,419 --> 00:16:31,649
of summers when we were watering and

356
00:16:28,188 --> 00:16:34,289
it's only continued to I think build the

357
00:16:31,649 --> 00:16:35,490
health of the soil you know cuz some

358
00:16:34,289 --> 00:16:37,289
people will come over and they're like

359
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:39,568
really you don't use any fertilizers or

360
00:16:37,289 --> 00:16:41,909
anything like that and I'm like no I'm

361
00:16:39,568 --> 00:16:44,938
not I I don't first of all I'm not going

362
00:16:41,909 --> 00:16:47,669
to buy that stuff second of all in a in

363
00:16:44,938 --> 00:16:52,019
the kind of garden that we have I'm not

364
00:16:47,669 --> 00:16:55,139
looking at the exception of the

365
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:57,539
vegetable beds I'm not looking for rapid

366
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:59,879
not looking for these plants to put on a

367
00:16:57,539 --> 00:17:01,799
lot of biomass and rapid growth because

368
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:03,778
these are all for the most part right

369
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:06,658
trees or perennials and these shrubs or

370
00:17:03,778 --> 00:17:11,308
perennials and I want them to have a

371
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:14,579
nice steady rate of growth because any

372
00:17:11,308 --> 00:17:16,619
any biomass that a plant puts out and

373
00:17:14,578 --> 00:17:19,438
really sort of rapid short order that's

374
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:23,489
beyond what its body would do normally

375
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:28,350
that's just like putting out pest food

376
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:31,079
and pathogen food and that is something

377
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:35,099
you know no gardener no gardener wants

378
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:39,779
and so it's I like to see an I like to

379
00:17:35,099 --> 00:17:42,839
see a plant that has a nice rate of

380
00:17:39,779 --> 00:17:45,450
growth say you know in the spring and

381
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:49,079
then it slows down in the summer and

382
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:52,019
then that that's kind of that it just

383
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:54,449
you don't get gangly looking plants you

384
00:17:52,019 --> 00:17:58,019
get robust and full looking plants and

385
00:17:54,450 --> 00:18:00,600
like I said there's I don't think a

386
00:17:58,019 --> 00:18:05,099
plant has the ability when it is putting

387
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:07,949
out a ton of growth I don't think a

388
00:18:05,099 --> 00:18:09,898
plant always has the ability to to stock

389
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:12,509
all of its defensive chemicals

390
00:18:09,898 --> 00:18:15,569
throughout all of the new new growth if

391
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:17,759
if you're you know heavily fertilizing

392
00:18:15,569 --> 00:18:19,648
something I mean you ask anybody you

393
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:21,720
know oh when did the aphids come on or

394
00:18:19,648 --> 00:18:24,379
when did this thing came on it's like

395
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:28,528
you know most of those problems happen

396
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:31,169
during not always but often during you

397
00:18:28,528 --> 00:18:33,630
know growth spurts of of plants because

398
00:18:31,169 --> 00:18:35,340
the pests know ah there's that nice

399
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:38,370
young fresh tissue there's where I'm

400
00:18:35,339 --> 00:18:40,859
gonna go you know insert my my pincher

401
00:18:38,369 --> 00:18:44,699
thing or my sucker thing and start

402
00:18:40,859 --> 00:18:46,678
eating up this plant so I I really like

403
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:49,889
to think about I I what I like to do is

404
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:54,149
sort of is try to match a plant both to

405
00:18:49,888 --> 00:18:57,388
my goals as a gardener and to what the

406
00:18:54,148 --> 00:19:02,928
capability of the soil is and I feel

407
00:18:57,388 --> 00:19:05,490
like a well grown plant is reflecting

408
00:19:02,929 --> 00:19:09,330
the quality to soil and the quality of

409
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:11,190
the environment in which it lives so I

410
00:19:09,329 --> 00:19:13,439
wanted to touch on this idea of organic

411
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:15,450
matter a little bit a little bit more

412
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:18,058
thoroughly in the sense that I know that

413
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:20,580
not all organic matter is created equal

414
00:19:18,058 --> 00:19:22,589
I mean putting out chicken manure is

415
00:19:20,579 --> 00:19:24,240
very different than putting out arborist

416
00:19:22,589 --> 00:19:27,778
chips just based on the carbon to

417
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:29,399
nitrogen ratio can you touch on your

418
00:19:27,778 --> 00:19:32,579
experiences with that and what you were

419
00:19:29,398 --> 00:19:35,729
using as sources for orchid mulching in

420
00:19:32,579 --> 00:19:38,308
your garden yeah yeah yeah you bring up

421
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:41,940
a really good point because I I I had a

422
00:19:38,308 --> 00:19:44,398
beautiful tree it since died and I and I

423
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:47,490
blame myself partly for that it was this

424
00:19:44,398 --> 00:19:51,239
it was this tree called two Red Bud so

425
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:53,609
this is a versus occidentalis is sort of

426
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:56,399
a native one what this tree is it's got

427
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:59,729
these gorgeous heart-shaped leaves and I

428
00:19:56,398 --> 00:20:02,019
had a cultivar of it that had this great

429
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:05,559
name that I love Forest pansy

430
00:20:02,019 --> 00:20:09,789
I mean who came up with that anyway this

431
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:12,849
tree this tree was was gorgeous that the

432
00:20:09,789 --> 00:20:15,539
leaf color was knocked my socks off it's

433
00:20:12,849 --> 00:20:18,759
actually the fall color on this tree and

434
00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:22,119
when I planted that tree it was a bare

435
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:25,569
root tree it was like maybe the diameter

436
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:28,719
of my thumb and my index finger together

437
00:20:25,569 --> 00:20:31,929
so pretty small tree and I was fortunate

438
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:33,730
enough to win the zoo do lottery and the

439
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:36,730
zoo do for those listeners who don't

440
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:41,589
know this is composted manure of the

441
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:43,750
herbivores at Seattle Zoo so the zoo has

442
00:20:41,589 --> 00:20:45,669
a program where they handle all the

443
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:47,559
composting of that manure and then every

444
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:52,269
spring and fall you send a postcard in

445
00:20:47,559 --> 00:20:55,179
and you can get to do and it is an

446
00:20:52,269 --> 00:20:59,740
animal manure and it is animal manures

447
00:20:55,180 --> 00:21:03,519
are high in nitrogen and we know that

448
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:08,289
nitrogen is what fuels mostly the green

449
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:12,490
growth of plants and so I thought I'll

450
00:21:08,289 --> 00:21:16,059
just tree needs to do so that's what I

451
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:18,190
did I put a lot of Zuzu on that tree

452
00:21:16,059 --> 00:21:25,379
probably two or three seasons in a row

453
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:25,380
and boy let me tell you that tree grew

454
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:32,680
it really grew but that tree also has a

455
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:37,990
problem it's got really lousy branching

456
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:40,539
structure which is to say that that tree

457
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:44,500
really wants to be a shrub it has no

458
00:21:40,539 --> 00:21:46,569
central dominant leader that you know

459
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:48,910
shoots up and that has you know

460
00:21:46,569 --> 00:21:50,649
well-behaved and well-structured lateral

461
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:54,940
branches coming off of that central

462
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:58,570
leader so I what this tree had was maybe

463
00:21:54,940 --> 00:22:02,710
four or five dominant leader stems

464
00:21:58,569 --> 00:22:06,429
shooting up to the sky and the problem

465
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:08,559
with that after about its tenth year was

466
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:10,420
that those branches those little stems

467
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:13,029
became bigger and bigger and bigger

468
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:15,910
branches heavier and heavier and it

469
00:22:13,029 --> 00:22:18,460
began to split right where those

470
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:22,210
those branches joined the main trunk of

471
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:24,880
the tree and I thought back to what was

472
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:26,170
going on and part of it was like I said

473
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:30,010
it's just the natural structure of that

474
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:32,650
tree but also I had boosted the growth

475
00:22:30,009 --> 00:22:34,359
like crazy of that tree in the early

476
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:36,490
years with all of that zoo do you know I

477
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:37,929
knocked that off after like several

478
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:41,230
years because I was sort of standing

479
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:43,240
back going wow this tree is growing

480
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:45,549
bigger faster than I ever thought it

481
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:49,000
could and at that point I just started

482
00:22:45,549 --> 00:22:51,250
doing straight wood chip mulch as and

483
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,980
straight wood chip mulch for me I really

484
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:57,970
like because it's really really good at

485
00:22:53,980 --> 00:23:00,880
doing two things yet suppresses weeds

486
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:04,630
and it does not give a seed a weed seed

487
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:07,510
place to germinate and because woodchips

488
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:09,370
are almost well they're from a

489
00:23:07,509 --> 00:23:14,589
composting standpoint they're considered

490
00:23:09,369 --> 00:23:16,209
you know purely you know all carbon very

491
00:23:14,589 --> 00:23:18,220
they're not really they're not a

492
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:22,529
nitrogen source at all so I like that

493
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:25,569
because it's a very slow feed slow

494
00:23:22,529 --> 00:23:27,569
decomposition process as as the

495
00:23:25,569 --> 00:23:30,750
woodchips come in contact of course with

496
00:23:27,569 --> 00:23:33,579
microbial life in soil and other and

497
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:35,769
sources of nitrogen in the soil it they

498
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:39,069
will decompose but it's but it's a slow

499
00:23:35,769 --> 00:23:41,079
process so that was my hard lesson in

500
00:23:39,069 --> 00:23:43,839
learning the difference between carbon

501
00:23:41,079 --> 00:23:47,230
sources of organic matter and nitrogen

502
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:49,659
sources of organic matter and now around

503
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:52,450
my trees because they're all they're

504
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:54,880
healthy they're they're doing their

505
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:57,279
thing of putting on a normal amount of

506
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:00,010
growth for whatever species they are I

507
00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:04,480
don't I do straight wood chip mulch on

508
00:24:00,009 --> 00:24:07,240
my trees and what I save my nitrogen

509
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:10,779
rich sources of organic matter for which

510
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:13,750
these days my primo source of of

511
00:24:10,779 --> 00:24:16,059
nitrogen rich organic matter my prized

512
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:19,180
source which I always wish I could have

513
00:24:16,059 --> 00:24:22,240
more of is the worm compost that I get

514
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:25,480
out of my worm bins and that is solely

515
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:29,170
dedicated to my vegetables my vegetable

516
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:31,950
beds because you know vegetables I

517
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:34,480
they'd be you know the closest thing to

518
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:38,200
cannabis right these are annual crops

519
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:41,829
and what you're looking for is lots of

520
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:43,210
biomass rapid growth in with my

521
00:24:41,829 --> 00:24:45,220
vegetables you know I want to get them

522
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:47,049
to whatever they're harvestable state is

523
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:50,829
whether that's a fruit like a tomato or

524
00:24:47,049 --> 00:24:53,799
a floppy floppy green leaf or or

525
00:24:50,829 --> 00:24:56,349
whatever so that's where I dedicate my

526
00:24:53,799 --> 00:25:01,289
nitrogen sources of organic matter is in

527
00:24:56,349 --> 00:25:05,349
the vegetable bed and other places I do

528
00:25:01,289 --> 00:25:08,319
I'll do spot I'll juice I'll do spot

529
00:25:05,349 --> 00:25:11,219
composting say you're not composting but

530
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:14,319
I'll I'll put out my zoo do as

531
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:17,380
perennials are coming up if I see that

532
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:20,349
one is sort of poking along I'll go and

533
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:26,050
I'll I'll call top dress with compost

534
00:25:20,349 --> 00:25:29,169
might add I never I rarely rarely well I

535
00:25:26,049 --> 00:25:32,589
actually never I I never did organic

536
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:35,019
matter into my existing soil and in part

537
00:25:32,589 --> 00:25:37,259
that's because I've got an existing

538
00:25:35,019 --> 00:25:39,730
plant there and so I don't want to be

539
00:25:37,259 --> 00:25:42,369
messing around with its roots and be

540
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:44,140
trying to get organic matter down you

541
00:25:42,369 --> 00:25:47,559
know in you know several inches down

542
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:49,270
below the soil what we're really blessed

543
00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:49,960
with in Seattle here is with all this

544
00:25:49,269 --> 00:25:53,109
rain

545
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:55,840
you know I can put compost around the

546
00:25:53,109 --> 00:25:58,569
crown of a perennial I might throw a few

547
00:25:55,839 --> 00:26:01,689
wood chips on top of that compost and

548
00:25:58,569 --> 00:26:05,529
then I let I let you know the rain and

549
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:07,660
the heat and microbial action decompose

550
00:26:05,529 --> 00:26:11,440
that and and pull those nutrients down

551
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:13,180
into the soil which then brings him in

552
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:16,059
contact with the roots and the plant can

553
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:21,009
take up what it needs and wants in that

554
00:26:16,059 --> 00:26:23,919
way so that's that's uh that's sort of

555
00:26:21,009 --> 00:26:28,180
how I think about organic matter I have

556
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:30,550
to say I'm somewhat I think there's

557
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:36,130
something instinctual in human beings

558
00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:37,690
both both about hoarding things the

559
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:39,310
friend who says yeah that's the whole

560
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:40,840
problem with agriculture turned us all

561
00:26:39,309 --> 00:26:41,899
into a bunch of hoarders we're hoarding

562
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:44,539
grains were

563
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:48,080
reading plans well in my case I'm kind

564
00:26:44,539 --> 00:26:50,569
of an organic matter order and and that

565
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:52,429
is to say that mostly what I coordinate

566
00:26:50,569 --> 00:26:54,349
this has to do with the quantities in

567
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:58,640
which it comes and that is wood chips if

568
00:26:54,349 --> 00:27:02,750
I get you know three or four or five

569
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:05,750
yards of wood chips I don't the soil

570
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:09,920
can't take I you know all of those wood

571
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:12,849
chips at one time so I store I store

572
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:17,390
wood chips and I will pull them out at

573
00:27:12,849 --> 00:27:20,240
different times of the year you know

574
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:22,220
typically fall in spring is when I like

575
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:25,759
to spread wood chips but if I'm doing

576
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:27,890
something in the summer and I know oh

577
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:29,539
yeah I've got my stash of wood chips I

578
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:31,660
can just go quickly you know get a

579
00:27:29,539 --> 00:27:36,409
wheelbarrow full and do some spot

580
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:38,480
mulching where say you know I'm finding

581
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:41,269
it thin in one area because that's it's

582
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:44,470
it's very you know organic matter is and

583
00:27:41,269 --> 00:27:46,910
the way that it breaks down and and

584
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:49,610
becomes incorporated into the soil

585
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:51,800
it's very elusive because you'll think

586
00:27:49,609 --> 00:27:55,549
you've put an adequate amount out there

587
00:27:51,799 --> 00:27:58,940
and you know by that I mean you know

588
00:27:55,549 --> 00:28:01,669
three four five inches let's say and

589
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:03,500
then I go out in mid mid to late summer

590
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:06,110
and I'm like where'd all that stuff go

591
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:07,789
I'm like scratching around and you know

592
00:28:06,109 --> 00:28:11,359
I have like a half an inch or an inch

593
00:28:07,789 --> 00:28:13,639
left so sometimes depending on the plant

594
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:15,500
in the situation and exposure and aspect

595
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:21,410
you know I might I might sort of touch

596
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:24,259
up mulch in the summertime but I i

597
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:31,160
generally I guess the upshot on all of

598
00:28:24,259 --> 00:28:33,619
that is nitrogen where I want lots of

599
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:37,190
biomass and especially leafy growth I'll

600
00:28:33,619 --> 00:28:42,829
put that out the other thing I pay

601
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:44,870
attention to with vegetables is so that

602
00:28:42,829 --> 00:28:48,379
you know the end the bag of fertilizer

603
00:28:44,869 --> 00:28:50,689
and the whole NPK thing so fruits in

604
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:53,510
order for you fruiting vegetables you

605
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:55,070
know tomato or cucumber or something

606
00:28:53,509 --> 00:28:57,500
like that

607
00:28:55,069 --> 00:29:01,939
I put always a little bit of phosphorus

608
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:04,250
out later a little bit later in the

609
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:06,679
summer to get to make sure that the

610
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:10,009
plant has enough phosphorous to get it

611
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:12,620
going in its fruiting stage and of

612
00:29:10,009 --> 00:29:17,569
course what comes before fruit is the

613
00:29:12,619 --> 00:29:20,449
flower so I like to pay attention to

614
00:29:17,569 --> 00:29:24,439
that for when I'm growing you know

615
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:24,798
fruiting vegetables something something

616
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:31,190
else

617
00:29:24,798 --> 00:29:32,839
oh yes basil I love to grow basil just

618
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:34,669
because there's just nothing that beats

619
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:38,528
fresh pesto and that's certainly a

620
00:29:34,669 --> 00:29:41,120
nitrogen and nitrogen hog of a plant and

621
00:29:38,528 --> 00:29:43,009
you'll get some pretty fantastic results

622
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:47,138
I remember one garden I had before I

623
00:29:43,009 --> 00:29:50,528
knew a whole lot I was always putting

624
00:29:47,138 --> 00:29:54,229
barely composted chicken manure out

625
00:29:50,528 --> 00:29:58,569
around some basil it didn't burn it but

626
00:29:54,230 --> 00:30:00,798
oh my god I got like just incredible

627
00:29:58,569 --> 00:30:02,418
incredible leaves a basil that year

628
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:05,028
somewhere almost as big as the palm of

629
00:30:02,419 --> 00:30:08,240
my hand so you know that that's what

630
00:30:05,028 --> 00:30:11,109
nitrogen and nitrogen rich sources a

631
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:13,788
compost in organic matter can do for you

632
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:15,528
so just real quick I just want to let

633
00:30:13,788 --> 00:30:17,359
listeners know that when you're talking

634
00:30:15,528 --> 00:30:21,679
about woodchips you're talking about

635
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:23,479
arborist chips and I know for us with

636
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:25,070
our with our farm we have a relationship

637
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:27,679
with local arborist he's a good friend

638
00:30:25,069 --> 00:30:30,500
of ours and so whenever he gets a load

639
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:32,419
of deciduous chips we always request

640
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:34,490
those in because they break down faster

641
00:30:32,419 --> 00:30:37,460
and then we'll use the Evergreen chips

642
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:40,609
or things like that from those trees as

643
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:43,850
our pathways because they take a little

644
00:30:40,609 --> 00:30:45,439
longer to break down right so we use

645
00:30:43,849 --> 00:30:47,449
wood chips a little differently they're

646
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:50,629
great in our in our chicken yard because

647
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:53,629
the high carbon is balanced with the

648
00:30:50,628 --> 00:30:56,178
nitrogen from the chicken manure so they

649
00:30:53,628 --> 00:31:01,308
they break down quite quite nicely and

650
00:30:56,179 --> 00:31:04,220
give us a nice layer of compost

651
00:31:01,308 --> 00:31:07,220
underneath yeah so it works really well

652
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:08,440
yeah but I wanted to go ahead and

653
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:10,299
transition in

654
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:13,480
talking about sort of your area of

655
00:31:10,299 --> 00:31:16,569
expertise in terms of the biological

656
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:18,789
aspects and the role that the microbes

657
00:31:16,569 --> 00:31:23,230
play in breaking down this organic

658
00:31:18,789 --> 00:31:25,920
matter and in sort of making these these

659
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:28,509
nutrients available to the planet yeah

660
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:31,720
we just posted on on Twitter the other

661
00:31:28,509 --> 00:31:35,710
day this really interesting paper that

662
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:39,490
that came out that I knew this before

663
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:42,850
but I always like to be reminded of it

664
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:46,509
and it and it's this we think we think

665
00:31:42,849 --> 00:31:49,209
about organic matter as being plant

666
00:31:46,509 --> 00:31:51,009
derived in a garden and I'm thinking of

667
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:53,079
my garden specifically you know I'll see

668
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:55,089
leaves in the fall and they've come off

669
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:57,519
the trees and they're right where I want

670
00:31:55,089 --> 00:32:01,419
them I think about that organic matter

671
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:03,879
you know being a part of the nutrient

672
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:07,960
cycle that is feeding the tree what this

673
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:11,500
paper showed is that most of the organic

674
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:16,090
matter I don't know about most much of

675
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:19,390
the organic matter in soil it's true

676
00:32:16,089 --> 00:32:21,669
that it starts with plants but all of

677
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:24,880
that organic matter becomes incorporated

678
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:28,450
into the bodies of trillions and

679
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:32,950
trillions of microorganisms so that's

680
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:35,259
bacteria that's fungi that's protists

681
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:37,900
that's all kinds of things and not just

682
00:32:35,259 --> 00:32:40,000
the microorganisms but becomes

683
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:42,640
incorporated into the bodies of the

684
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,220
things that eat the microorganisms so

685
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:48,490
you step it up to you know slightly

686
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:52,630
larger forms of life you know worms and

687
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:55,569
nematodes and and so on so that most of

688
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:59,620
the organic matter that ends up in soil

689
00:32:55,569 --> 00:33:02,200
it's getting there not because it's dead

690
00:32:59,619 --> 00:33:05,769
plant matter but because it's dead

691
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:09,670
microbial matter and this is a really

692
00:33:05,769 --> 00:33:12,180
interesting way to think about organic

693
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:19,870
matter in organic matter cycling because

694
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:22,299
how do we get a lot of microorganisms

695
00:33:19,869 --> 00:33:22,689
you know flourishing and thriving in

696
00:33:22,299 --> 00:33:24,940
this

697
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:27,129
by this I mean the beneficial ones we of

698
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:30,210
course are not talking you don't want a

699
00:33:27,128 --> 00:33:31,959
bunch of pathogens in the soil we want I

700
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:34,239
always want our beneficial

701
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:37,749
microorganisms and other life forms to

702
00:33:34,239 --> 00:33:40,450
be in larger numbers bigger populations

703
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:44,399
and so on than the the pathogens and

704
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:47,440
pests and so when you have all of these

705
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:49,449
life forms in the soil they're just like

706
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,639
us at our dinner table and they need to

707
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:53,109
eat and so this is what the plants are

708
00:33:51,638 --> 00:33:54,788
doing this is what all this dead plant

709
00:33:53,108 --> 00:33:58,720
matter is doing whether it's wood chip

710
00:33:54,788 --> 00:34:01,179
or a fresh green leaf that is food for

711
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:05,710
all of the microorganisms which become

712
00:34:01,179 --> 00:34:10,418
the organic matter that is what ends up

713
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:14,280
in the soil and it it even goes beyond

714
00:34:10,418 --> 00:34:17,348
that because we know now that there's a

715
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:19,569
one of the most life dense zones on the

716
00:34:17,349 --> 00:34:22,000
entire planet is around the root system

717
00:34:19,568 --> 00:34:27,038
of a plant and that area is called the

718
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:29,230
rhizosphere RHIC oh and then sphere so

719
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:29,799
sphere is you know just area around and

720
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:31,719
raizou

721
00:34:29,798 --> 00:34:34,418
is I can't remember if it's Greek or

722
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:36,459
Latin for root but I think about it as

723
00:34:34,418 --> 00:34:40,898
the house of the root the area of the

724
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:44,409
root and that's where bacteria and fungi

725
00:34:40,898 --> 00:34:46,898
in particular are running to the root

726
00:34:44,409 --> 00:34:50,588
system of a healthy plant and a healthy

727
00:34:46,898 --> 00:34:56,348
soil as though that is you know their

728
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:58,480
dinner and there's a very good reason

729
00:34:56,349 --> 00:35:02,170
for that this area called the

730
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:07,358
rhizosphere is where a plant will take

731
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:09,338
up to like 40% of all of these compounds

732
00:35:07,358 --> 00:35:11,558
that it has made through photosynthesis

733
00:35:09,338 --> 00:35:14,818
and these compounds are things like

734
00:35:11,559 --> 00:35:19,119
carbohydrates and fats and proteins and

735
00:35:14,818 --> 00:35:21,759
it turns these compounds well a

736
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:25,528
microorganism considers all of that

737
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:28,390
stuff food and so a plant is exuding

738
00:35:25,528 --> 00:35:30,849
these compounds out of its roots that

739
00:35:28,389 --> 00:35:34,179
the the name for that is exudates you

740
00:35:30,849 --> 00:35:36,670
just think outward flowing food from the

741
00:35:34,179 --> 00:35:40,149
root system marker ordinate Mike

742
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:44,200
organisms lap that stuff up and then in

743
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:47,139
return they're making metabolites out of

744
00:35:44,199 --> 00:35:49,538
this out of these compounds that they've

745
00:35:47,139 --> 00:35:51,608
received from the plants and like any

746
00:35:49,539 --> 00:35:54,460
organism they excrete things out of

747
00:35:51,608 --> 00:35:58,088
their bodies and some of the microbial

748
00:35:54,460 --> 00:36:00,460
metabolites that have been discovered in

749
00:35:58,088 --> 00:36:04,960
the soil include things like plant

750
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:06,309
growth promoting hormones and so this is

751
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:10,599
pretty this is really interesting you

752
00:36:06,309 --> 00:36:13,480
know you've got one part of the world of

753
00:36:10,599 --> 00:36:15,760
life the microorganisms making things

754
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:19,599
that help another completely area of

755
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:22,000
life the botanical world so these are

756
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:23,068
some of the things that happen in the

757
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:27,789
rhizosphere

758
00:36:23,068 --> 00:36:31,409
and it it tells us that this is also one

759
00:36:27,789 --> 00:36:35,170
of the we often think about coevolution

760
00:36:31,409 --> 00:36:38,440
as as being on occurring in the

761
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:41,440
above-ground realm of a plants green

762
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:45,278
body you know the birds and the bees and

763
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:47,858
the flowers and intricate intricate way

764
00:36:45,278 --> 00:36:50,380
in which that all works but the

765
00:36:47,858 --> 00:36:53,400
symbiotic relationships below ground are

766
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:56,289
just every bit as sophisticated and

767
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:58,048
long-standing as what is going well

768
00:36:56,289 --> 00:37:01,660
there actually go back even further

769
00:36:58,048 --> 00:37:05,108
because they predate flowering plants so

770
00:37:01,659 --> 00:37:07,028
this is this is really this is really

771
00:37:05,108 --> 00:37:10,500
fundamental and it's really important

772
00:37:07,028 --> 00:37:13,199
that we have some of the grandest

773
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:16,119
symbiotic relationships on this planet

774
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:19,719
occurring right beneath our feet and in

775
00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:22,660
a place that we still don't understand

776
00:37:19,719 --> 00:37:25,808
that well and we don't we we may never

777
00:37:22,659 --> 00:37:30,149
know how everything works and what what

778
00:37:25,809 --> 00:37:32,890
that tells me is is a couple things

779
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:34,750
because this is what's going on in the

780
00:37:32,889 --> 00:37:36,368
soil around the roots of a plant is so

781
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:38,619
fundamental to a plant's health and

782
00:37:36,369 --> 00:37:41,440
well-being that really what we ought to

783
00:37:38,619 --> 00:37:44,920
be doing with whatever kind of plant

784
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:49,079
we're growing is seeking ways to support

785
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:49,079
those symbiosis because

786
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:54,059
long before we had agrochemical

787
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:56,010
companies long before we had bags of

788
00:37:54,059 --> 00:37:57,960
fertilizer and and all of these other

789
00:37:56,010 --> 00:38:00,450
various things in the agricultural and

790
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:03,539
horticultural world all the plants ever

791
00:38:00,449 --> 00:38:05,429
had was the symbiotic relationship where

792
00:38:03,539 --> 00:38:07,588
it's feeding the microbes the microbes

793
00:38:05,429 --> 00:38:11,460
are making metabolites and the plant is

794
00:38:07,588 --> 00:38:14,159
pulling in those metabolites and it's

795
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:18,030
not only just metabolites but fungi in

796
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:22,348
particular will they they can greatly

797
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:25,290
extend well functionally anyway the

798
00:38:22,349 --> 00:38:28,588
reach of a plant's roots and so they'll

799
00:38:25,289 --> 00:38:30,869
be out far away from a plant pulling

800
00:38:28,588 --> 00:38:34,049
things like phosphorus that's the P of

801
00:38:30,869 --> 00:38:36,000
the NPK out of the soil and they

802
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:39,000
transport it back to the plant and give

803
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:43,019
it to the plant and so these are the

804
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:47,159
sorts of natural processes that we don't

805
00:38:43,019 --> 00:38:49,320
need to pay for them I'd rather have I'd

806
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:52,489
rather have fungi doing my work for me

807
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:57,240
then you know running out and buying

808
00:38:52,489 --> 00:38:59,789
synthetic fertilizers and it we also

809
00:38:57,239 --> 00:39:03,959
know that you know plants and the

810
00:38:59,789 --> 00:39:05,429
microbial the soil microbiome they've

811
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:08,369
worked out their relationships with

812
00:39:05,429 --> 00:39:12,750
their their trades in the rhizosphere in

813
00:39:08,369 --> 00:39:15,780
ways that keeps both you know the rate

814
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:19,559
and growth of the plant sort of in

815
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:23,190
balance with the soil so you're not

816
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:26,639
getting excess growth that becomes you

817
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:29,670
know food for food for some pests or

818
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:31,650
pathogen so I really think of the

819
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:35,420
microbial world the soil microbiome

820
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:41,220
which you know in the root microbiome as

821
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:43,700
it's sort of like the plant Arsenal

822
00:39:41,219 --> 00:39:48,358
combined with the plant pharmacy

823
00:39:43,699 --> 00:39:50,159
combined with the plants say cellular

824
00:39:48,358 --> 00:39:52,679
communication device because there's a

825
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:55,949
ton of signaling that goes on between

826
00:39:52,679 --> 00:39:59,338
the microbes around the roots and in the

827
00:39:55,949 --> 00:40:02,159
plant itself that that are related to

828
00:39:59,338 --> 00:40:03,360
how plants defend themselves against

829
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:07,679
above ground and

830
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:09,300
low ground pests and how plants are

831
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:12,739
communicating with one another I mean

832
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:19,080
it's it's a really really fascinating

833
00:40:12,739 --> 00:40:21,689
world and I I would love it if I know a

834
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:24,960
lot of cannabis growers for legitimate

835
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:26,909
and historic reasons they're growing

836
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:31,710
they're growing these plants inside and

837
00:40:26,909 --> 00:40:33,000
I think that that is that's just the way

838
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:36,210
it is and I get that

839
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:42,599
but there is it I think that's hard on a

840
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:45,570
plant's body to be to be sort of taken

841
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:47,339
out of out of where a plant would

842
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:51,930
normally grow which is in the soil

843
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:55,380
outside in sunlight exposed to you know

844
00:40:51,929 --> 00:40:58,679
all kinds of biological and

845
00:40:55,380 --> 00:41:04,980
non-biological factors that give the

846
00:40:58,679 --> 00:41:07,139
plant its its hardiness the case of food

847
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:08,969
plants taste and flavor in the case of

848
00:41:07,139 --> 00:41:11,779
cannabis you know all of these

849
00:41:08,969 --> 00:41:14,969
phytochemicals that translate into

850
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:17,730
flavors and smells and whether one's

851
00:41:14,969 --> 00:41:21,389
using cannabis medicinally or psycho or

852
00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:24,360
for recreational reasons everything that

853
00:41:21,389 --> 00:41:27,599
it that everything that went into the

854
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:31,740
that plants growth is manifest in in

855
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:34,769
some ways by the growing environment

856
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:37,109
that it came out of so I would love to

857
00:41:34,769 --> 00:41:39,030
see more cannabis grown outside and in

858
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:42,750
the Sun although I completely understand

859
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:44,130
why it's not and why in such cases you

860
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:49,320
know you just need more interventions

861
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:53,940
you need more more assist of plants if

862
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:58,920
they're grown indoors but it's I don't

863
00:41:53,940 --> 00:42:01,170
know how that's gonna ever turn you know

864
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:03,150
whether it's yeah I think that's a

865
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:04,860
that's a difficult thing because it's

866
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:10,250
just not this is just not sustainable

867
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:12,660
either so anyway I hope that I hope that

868
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:15,659
things can turn around on that front

869
00:42:12,659 --> 00:42:16,529
with cannabis cultivation well I think

870
00:42:15,659 --> 00:42:20,250
there are some issues

871
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:22,500
around temperature in in terms of in

872
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:24,539
some areas like here in Washington okay

873
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:26,519
yeah it's just it's too cold to grow it

874
00:42:24,539 --> 00:42:30,059
outdoors for large portions of the year

875
00:42:26,519 --> 00:42:32,630
right one of the things that we work

876
00:42:30,059 --> 00:42:34,949
with Brewers on is trying to incorporate

877
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:37,590
what a lot of people are calling living

878
00:42:34,949 --> 00:42:39,509
soils with the idea being that we're

879
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:43,860
cultivating these microbial interactions

880
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:45,510
and reusing the soil to create this

881
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:47,550
ecosystem similar to we would have

882
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:48,990
outdoors because like you mentioned

883
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:53,039
these phytochemical reactions that are

884
00:42:48,989 --> 00:42:55,259
going on or interactions really do have

885
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:58,159
a large influence on the odor and the

886
00:42:55,260 --> 00:43:00,570
flavor of whatever crop you're growing

887
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:03,149
and there are some nutrients that are

888
00:43:00,570 --> 00:43:05,160
tied to to terpene expression like

889
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:08,280
sulfur but a lot of it is the microbial

890
00:43:05,159 --> 00:43:10,079
community and one of the one of the

891
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:11,880
interesting statistics that I think

892
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:14,460
really shows how important that is to

893
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:16,800
the plant is it's been it's been

894
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:20,699
established that something like 30% of

895
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:22,260
the of the energy that the plant takes

896
00:43:20,699 --> 00:43:24,569
in through photosynthesis is putting

897
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:29,070
back out through the roots as a way of

898
00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:30,809
fostering that microbial relationship in

899
00:43:29,070 --> 00:43:32,970
the form of exudates which she described

900
00:43:30,809 --> 00:43:35,699
I just think that's that's amazing that

901
00:43:32,969 --> 00:43:37,739
they would give up that much of the sort

902
00:43:35,699 --> 00:43:40,289
of nutrients that they're taking in just

903
00:43:37,739 --> 00:43:42,599
to you know promote this symbiotic

904
00:43:40,289 --> 00:43:45,509
relationship yeah

905
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:47,929
and you know it makes a lot of it makes

906
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:52,620
a lot of sense biologically because

907
00:43:47,929 --> 00:43:54,750
plants have this thing that no other no

908
00:43:52,619 --> 00:43:58,170
other life form has and that is the

909
00:43:54,750 --> 00:44:02,639
ability to capture sunlight combine it

910
00:43:58,170 --> 00:44:07,230
with water oxygen and through

911
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:09,029
photosynthesis make food you're some

912
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:12,960
soil organism living in the dark

913
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:15,060
subterranean and and you're on the roots

914
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:19,079
of this thing that is basically a food

915
00:44:15,059 --> 00:44:24,299
factory and and at the same time you're

916
00:44:19,079 --> 00:44:29,279
able as a microorganism to do equally

917
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:30,269
impressive chemistry with you know the

918
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:33,600
things that are available

919
00:44:30,269 --> 00:44:36,929
to microbe in the soil and then hand

920
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:39,329
that over to a plant I mean it it's what

921
00:44:36,929 --> 00:44:42,868
it really does is it takes sort of the

922
00:44:39,329 --> 00:44:46,380
genomic potential of a plant and all of

923
00:44:42,869 --> 00:44:48,869
its photosynthetic capability and it

924
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:52,829
takes a genomic potential of say a

925
00:44:48,869 --> 00:44:58,490
bacterium and it makes this new organism

926
00:44:52,829 --> 00:45:00,900
that is sort of fully fully capable of

927
00:44:58,489 --> 00:45:02,819
using everything that's in the

928
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:04,950
above-ground environment and the below

929
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:09,210
ground environment and bring it together

930
00:45:04,949 --> 00:45:11,460
into this I don't want to go so far as

931
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:14,639
to say a new life form but with a lot of

932
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:17,099
the microbiome research that's that

933
00:45:14,639 --> 00:45:19,279
conceptually at least is how people

934
00:45:17,099 --> 00:45:22,860
think about not just plants but also

935
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:25,650
people and you know all kinds of things

936
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:27,329
from the goldfish to the to the polar

937
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:29,550
bear there's what we see in what we

938
00:45:27,329 --> 00:45:31,739
think is the life form but then there's

939
00:45:29,550 --> 00:45:34,289
what we can't see the invisible that

940
00:45:31,739 --> 00:45:37,279
tells us that we are all sort of in

941
00:45:34,289 --> 00:45:37,279
amalgamated

942
00:45:39,050 --> 00:45:46,830
at that is a really different way to

943
00:45:41,608 --> 00:45:51,449
think about a plant a person anything

944
00:45:46,829 --> 00:45:53,869
like that yeah yeah isn't there

945
00:45:51,449 --> 00:45:56,250
something about how the majority of what

946
00:45:53,869 --> 00:45:59,090
the number of cells on the human body

947
00:45:56,250 --> 00:46:02,659
the majority of them are actually not

948
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:07,289
human cells but microorganisms or other

949
00:46:02,659 --> 00:46:10,920
other living I think you know yeah yeah

950
00:46:07,289 --> 00:46:12,869
that's right there at when early several

951
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:14,159
years ago there was sort of an estimate

952
00:46:12,869 --> 00:46:16,320
that got out there that was inaccurate

953
00:46:14,159 --> 00:46:18,989
that there was ten times as many

954
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:20,960
microbial cells as human cells in the

955
00:46:18,989 --> 00:46:25,199
human body and it's it's since been

956
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:27,858
adjusted and it's around at least at

957
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:30,509
least equal numbers if not slightly more

958
00:46:27,858 --> 00:46:33,480
microbial cells but however you look at

959
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:36,210
that if if you look at a person you

960
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:39,750
think okay that person's half person and

961
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:42,449
half microbe it you know it puts a whole

962
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:44,780
new light on things like what are those

963
00:46:42,449 --> 00:46:47,069
microbes doing

964
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:48,780
maybe people should take care of their

965
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:51,420
microbes since they're a part of their

966
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:55,320
body and since they do things like you

967
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:59,780
know they help us digest our food really

968
00:46:55,320 --> 00:47:02,250
interesting work is being done around

969
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:05,120
sort of brain health and the gut

970
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:07,710
microbiome because for example Sarah

971
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:10,380
serotonin is a neurotransmitter and it

972
00:47:07,710 --> 00:47:12,720
helps our brain work and it affects

973
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:15,240
whether we're feeling happy or sad and

974
00:47:12,719 --> 00:47:17,189
so people had assumed for a long time

975
00:47:15,239 --> 00:47:18,719
all that serotonin that must be made up

976
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:21,869
in the brain because that's where most

977
00:47:18,719 --> 00:47:25,349
of it's used no in fact most of the

978
00:47:21,869 --> 00:47:29,900
serotonin is made in the lower reaches

979
00:47:25,349 --> 00:47:35,549
of our gut by our members of our

980
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:36,920
microbiome so that tells us that you

981
00:47:35,550 --> 00:47:41,580
know there's some pretty fundamental

982
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:45,539
connections between health of our bodies

983
00:47:41,579 --> 00:47:48,000
the health of our minds and what our gut

984
00:47:45,539 --> 00:47:51,900
microbiota are doing and this is where

985
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:53,699
much like the diet of the soil you know

986
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:55,980
we talked about different forms of

987
00:47:53,699 --> 00:47:59,159
organic matter and what the responses of

988
00:47:55,980 --> 00:48:03,179
a plant are to the different forms of

989
00:47:59,159 --> 00:48:05,489
organic matter and really are our gut is

990
00:48:03,179 --> 00:48:08,460
is very much analogous to the root

991
00:48:05,489 --> 00:48:10,919
system of a plant because we've got all

992
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:12,690
these microbes living living in our

993
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:17,070
digestive tract especially the lower

994
00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:19,440
reaches and they need to eat and as it

995
00:48:17,070 --> 00:48:20,940
turns out all you know for years and

996
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:22,139
years we've all heard oh you should eat

997
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:23,550
your fruits and vegetables are good for

998
00:48:22,139 --> 00:48:26,609
you they're good for you no they're not

999
00:48:23,550 --> 00:48:32,510
so much as good for you as they are the

1000
00:48:26,610 --> 00:48:35,280
fodder that it appears feeds the

1001
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:38,580
microbial strains and species and

1002
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:41,550
communities that are the ones that churn

1003
00:48:38,579 --> 00:48:44,789
out a huge number of compounds and

1004
00:48:41,550 --> 00:48:46,560
molecules that have medicinal effects in

1005
00:48:44,789 --> 00:48:50,210
our body so you know I mentioned

1006
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:54,110
serotonin is one such metabolite there's

1007
00:48:50,210 --> 00:48:57,269
another compound called butyrate that is

1008
00:48:54,110 --> 00:49:01,829
really important for

1009
00:48:57,269 --> 00:49:04,019
: health and also important in sort of

1010
00:49:01,829 --> 00:49:08,099
modulating and regulating the way our

1011
00:49:04,019 --> 00:49:11,250
immune system works so just like the

1012
00:49:08,099 --> 00:49:12,630
root the root microbiome is making

1013
00:49:11,250 --> 00:49:15,210
things like you know I've mentioned the

1014
00:49:12,630 --> 00:49:16,680
plant growth promoting hormone which is

1015
00:49:15,210 --> 00:49:19,380
a good thing for the plant our

1016
00:49:16,679 --> 00:49:23,639
microbiome is making all kinds of

1017
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:25,798
compounds and molecules that have it's

1018
00:49:23,639 --> 00:49:28,920
not just there's many beneficial effects

1019
00:49:25,798 --> 00:49:31,259
but you get just like in the soil you

1020
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:33,358
get something funky going on and then

1021
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:35,670
you can have your microbiome may be

1022
00:49:33,358 --> 00:49:38,639
making compounds and molecules that

1023
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:40,470
aren't so good for us but we do know

1024
00:49:38,639 --> 00:49:42,480
that across the board it seems that you

1025
00:49:40,469 --> 00:49:45,598
know a high-fiber diet which is to say

1026
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:47,909
one that is an abundance not exclusively

1027
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:51,990
but certainly an abundance of

1028
00:49:47,909 --> 00:49:56,429
unprocessed plant foods is is something

1029
00:49:51,989 --> 00:50:00,659
that our microbiome really really

1030
00:49:56,429 --> 00:50:05,129
thrives on yeah it's very it's it's very

1031
00:50:00,659 --> 00:50:08,548
interesting yeah I I recently heard a

1032
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:09,930
podcast by Paul Stamets oh that was just

1033
00:50:08,548 --> 00:50:12,179
it was great it was on the Joe Rogan

1034
00:50:09,929 --> 00:50:14,009
podcast I can send you a link to it if

1035
00:50:12,179 --> 00:50:18,538
you haven't heard it but he talks about

1036
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:21,720
the role of a fungi and how it it's in

1037
00:50:18,539 --> 00:50:23,400
its impacts on human health certain

1038
00:50:21,719 --> 00:50:24,989
things like lions made for example he

1039
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:27,568
said there's found that you can actually

1040
00:50:24,989 --> 00:50:30,479
form new neurological connections in

1041
00:50:27,568 --> 00:50:32,719
your brain so I've started taking some

1042
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:36,960
of his muscle mushroom supplements

1043
00:50:32,719 --> 00:50:39,929
Beyonce and I and we feel like they're

1044
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:43,170
making a difference in terms of how we

1045
00:50:39,929 --> 00:50:44,909
feel and there is some research to

1046
00:50:43,170 --> 00:50:47,159
support this it's pretty interesting and

1047
00:50:44,909 --> 00:50:48,420
I'm not talking about psychoactive

1048
00:50:47,159 --> 00:50:51,420
mushrooms so that is something he

1049
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:53,329
discusses as well in the podcast which

1050
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:55,440
is really interesting but just the

1051
00:50:53,329 --> 00:50:58,680
normal mushrooms that you could find in

1052
00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:03,838
the grocery store right right yeah there

1053
00:50:58,679 --> 00:51:06,239
are there are it's it's the whole

1054
00:51:03,838 --> 00:51:10,318
mushroom world is I think greatly under

1055
00:51:06,239 --> 00:51:11,098
researched you know we know we know a

1056
00:51:10,318 --> 00:51:13,139
bit of

1057
00:51:11,099 --> 00:51:15,298
you know phytochemicals say for example

1058
00:51:13,139 --> 00:51:18,118
in cannabis you know we know about

1059
00:51:15,298 --> 00:51:20,639
phytochemicals in tomatoes or carrots

1060
00:51:18,119 --> 00:51:23,369
and some of these things but thinking

1061
00:51:20,639 --> 00:51:25,528
about the phytochemicals say from fungi

1062
00:51:23,369 --> 00:51:27,930
because what happens in our gut with

1063
00:51:25,528 --> 00:51:31,619
with these phytochemicals that are that

1064
00:51:27,929 --> 00:51:33,719
are bound up when we're eating whole

1065
00:51:31,619 --> 00:51:36,358
plants or whole whole mushrooms or

1066
00:51:33,719 --> 00:51:39,118
mushroom extracts I would also expect to

1067
00:51:36,358 --> 00:51:41,219
some degree is that our gut microbiota

1068
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:43,710
get ahold of these phytochemicals and

1069
00:51:41,219 --> 00:51:46,199
they they basically they're fermenting

1070
00:51:43,710 --> 00:51:50,369
them and when they ferment them it turns

1071
00:51:46,199 --> 00:51:53,848
it in to other bioactive compounds and

1072
00:51:50,369 --> 00:51:57,318
products that our body knows what to do

1073
00:51:53,849 --> 00:51:57,318
with those things so that's where

1074
00:51:57,650 --> 00:52:07,440
mushrooms whole plant foods I don't want

1075
00:52:02,518 --> 00:52:10,078
to call them drugs but they can have

1076
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:12,838
drug like effects in us and I think part

1077
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:14,849
of that probably goes way way back in

1078
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:16,978
human evolution where when we were

1079
00:52:14,849 --> 00:52:21,269
hunter-gatherers right all we were doing

1080
00:52:16,978 --> 00:52:23,189
was eating wild plants and sometimes you

1081
00:52:21,268 --> 00:52:26,338
know maybe you ate the wrong thing and

1082
00:52:23,190 --> 00:52:27,599
you were done with but knowledge and

1083
00:52:26,338 --> 00:52:29,219
tradition was passed down from

1084
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:31,559
generation to generation and that's

1085
00:52:29,219 --> 00:52:35,219
where of course all the traditions of

1086
00:52:31,559 --> 00:52:39,960
herbal healing come in and so these

1087
00:52:35,219 --> 00:52:43,409
plants were you know I think in some

1088
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:46,108
ways became a part of our bodies because

1089
00:52:43,409 --> 00:52:48,509
people knew in those times okay this

1090
00:52:46,108 --> 00:52:50,338
plant for this ailment this plant for

1091
00:52:48,509 --> 00:52:52,559
this malady we know this plant comes up

1092
00:52:50,338 --> 00:52:54,268
in the spring and we know this malady

1093
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:56,069
often comes up in the spring and so

1094
00:52:54,268 --> 00:52:58,108
let's put those two things together I

1095
00:52:56,068 --> 00:53:03,599
don't know maybe this is the deep roots

1096
00:52:58,108 --> 00:53:07,558
of my plant lust yeah I think I think

1097
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:11,999
anybody who ventures into growing a

1098
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:16,048
plant of some sort it gets you in touch

1099
00:53:11,998 --> 00:53:19,048
with our relationship to the botanical

1100
00:53:16,048 --> 00:53:21,568
world and really how ancient how ancient

1101
00:53:19,048 --> 00:53:24,449
it is and how much we need to have

1102
00:53:21,568 --> 00:53:27,059
plants in our lives for

1103
00:53:24,449 --> 00:53:31,949
kinds of reasons you know from aesthetic

1104
00:53:27,059 --> 00:53:35,759
to medicinal to recreational to you know

1105
00:53:31,949 --> 00:53:38,838
just the amount of carbon cycling that

1106
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:43,140
plants are involved with on this planet

1107
00:53:38,838 --> 00:53:45,900
we we all I think tad would would do

1108
00:53:43,139 --> 00:53:48,088
better if we got in touch with our the

1109
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:48,800
roots of plant lust I'll leave it at

1110
00:53:48,088 --> 00:53:53,429
that

1111
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:57,539
so beyond mulching how else can we

1112
00:53:53,429 --> 00:54:01,069
foster the this microbial relationship

1113
00:53:57,539 --> 00:54:07,079
that the plant has win it its microbiome

1114
00:54:01,070 --> 00:54:08,849
yeah I think you know as much as we love

1115
00:54:07,079 --> 00:54:10,619
our plants and I certainly get it

1116
00:54:08,849 --> 00:54:12,720
especially somebody in a in an

1117
00:54:10,619 --> 00:54:17,460
agricultural or a cannabis growing

1118
00:54:12,719 --> 00:54:19,919
environment right are our hands in our

1119
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:22,500
minds in one way or another are all over

1120
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:26,519
that plant we want that plant to grow

1121
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:29,400
and we will do anything just about to

1122
00:54:26,519 --> 00:54:33,179
get that to allow that to happen and I

1123
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:35,338
think I think our penchant for sort of

1124
00:54:33,179 --> 00:54:36,029
interfering with the interference isn't

1125
00:54:35,338 --> 00:54:38,250
the right word

1126
00:54:36,030 --> 00:54:41,540
our penchant for sort of manipulating

1127
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:46,099
and managing things I think we need to

1128
00:54:41,539 --> 00:54:52,889
maybe check that at the door more than

1129
00:54:46,099 --> 00:54:54,480
more than we do because the more we sort

1130
00:54:52,889 --> 00:54:56,789
of think we're gonna one-up Mother

1131
00:54:54,480 --> 00:55:00,559
Nature or we're gonna one-up you know

1132
00:54:56,789 --> 00:55:03,449
how this plant is growing and variably

1133
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:05,818
you're altering you're altering

1134
00:55:03,449 --> 00:55:07,980
something about about the trajectory of

1135
00:55:05,818 --> 00:55:09,900
that plant's life and that in the way

1136
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:12,389
that that plant is growing and I think

1137
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:16,019
stepping back and going okay on the

1138
00:55:12,389 --> 00:55:19,078
whole you know what are the consequences

1139
00:55:16,019 --> 00:55:21,119
of me doing this is it going to get it

1140
00:55:19,079 --> 00:55:23,670
going to net me really what I want or is

1141
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:29,670
it or might it possibly have this

1142
00:55:23,670 --> 00:55:33,420
downside as I think I really think

1143
00:55:29,670 --> 00:55:35,760
growing plants is figuring figuring out

1144
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:38,340
okay what does this plant want to do

1145
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:42,210
what is its body primed to do

1146
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:45,329
what can I do as the grower to give it

1147
00:55:42,210 --> 00:55:49,260
everything it needs to let you know to

1148
00:55:45,329 --> 00:55:53,369
let that growth occur so I like thinking

1149
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:56,250
about sort of getting out of the way of

1150
00:55:53,369 --> 00:55:59,279
natural processes but not to the point

1151
00:55:56,250 --> 00:56:01,829
of just walking away from something but

1152
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:05,550
being mindful about okay how are my

1153
00:56:01,829 --> 00:56:10,049
practices how are my practice is really

1154
00:56:05,550 --> 00:56:13,530
going to help things along and so for

1155
00:56:10,050 --> 00:56:15,960
example I realized that for some

1156
00:56:13,530 --> 00:56:18,600
situations in cannabis is certainly one

1157
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:20,730
of them you know actually I would I

1158
00:56:18,599 --> 00:56:23,849
would I would almost consider cannabis

1159
00:56:20,730 --> 00:56:25,740
to be in the same world as bonsai but

1160
00:56:23,849 --> 00:56:28,440
you know they're in different places on

1161
00:56:25,739 --> 00:56:32,599
that continuum these are both highly

1162
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:35,000
manipulated kinds of plants and growing

1163
00:56:32,599 --> 00:56:37,650
environments and you can get beautiful

1164
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:41,309
results in both cases but to just be

1165
00:56:37,650 --> 00:56:44,730
aware that we are in the end you know

1166
00:56:41,309 --> 00:56:48,150
working with the botanical world as

1167
00:56:44,730 --> 00:56:50,039
opposed to you know trying to get the

1168
00:56:48,150 --> 00:56:52,860
botanical world to do things that it

1169
00:56:50,039 --> 00:56:56,400
just really you know isn't isn't going

1170
00:56:52,860 --> 00:56:58,440
to be good at doing so you know and in

1171
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:00,630
fact I've done my own share of you know

1172
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:03,269
manipulating and managing plants in my

1173
00:57:00,630 --> 00:57:05,250
garden from the way that I prune things

1174
00:57:03,269 --> 00:57:08,340
from the way that you know I'll take a

1175
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:09,989
look at a plant and if it's if it's if

1176
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:12,360
it's been sickly for too long I don't

1177
00:57:09,989 --> 00:57:15,239
have many plants like this but I've been

1178
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:18,539
known to to pull a plant up and say okay

1179
00:57:15,239 --> 00:57:20,250
I'm done with you I don't know I don't

1180
00:57:18,539 --> 00:57:22,320
know what is ailing you you know I've

1181
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:25,199
tried this and this and this but you're

1182
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:27,030
out of the garden and this just was not

1183
00:57:25,199 --> 00:57:30,599
a good place for you so there's also

1184
00:57:27,030 --> 00:57:33,870
there's also that space of of knowing

1185
00:57:30,599 --> 00:57:34,860
that you know the chemistry and and I

1186
00:57:33,869 --> 00:57:37,109
don't mean that in the you know

1187
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:38,880
synthetic chemistry the metaphorical I

1188
00:57:37,110 --> 00:57:40,380
mean this in the metaphorical chemistry

1189
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:42,599
sense you know the chemistry is just not

1190
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:44,940
right between you and the soil between

1191
00:57:42,599 --> 00:57:47,549
me and you between the place that I have

1192
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:48,840
for you and so we're you know gonna put

1193
00:57:47,550 --> 00:57:51,870
everybody out of their misery right now

1194
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:54,690
and all I will I'll pull up a plant and

1195
00:57:51,869 --> 00:57:56,940
and that that's that's really hard to do

1196
00:57:54,690 --> 00:57:59,010
though tad because for a person with

1197
00:57:56,940 --> 00:58:01,019
plant list right you're like oh what am

1198
00:57:59,010 --> 00:58:02,610
I doing here then in the end you know

1199
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:04,409
most the time it actually works out okay

1200
00:58:02,610 --> 00:58:07,260
because I gained some new real estate to

1201
00:58:04,409 --> 00:58:09,809
put something else in that spot that I

1202
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:12,300
think I've made a better selection about

1203
00:58:09,809 --> 00:58:15,559
how it's going to respond to you know

1204
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:18,690
that particular setting in the garden

1205
00:58:15,559 --> 00:58:20,969
yes so just to keep things moving along

1206
00:58:18,690 --> 00:58:23,610
for the listeners I wanted to ask a

1207
00:58:20,969 --> 00:58:25,559
little bit about your upcoming work I

1208
00:58:23,610 --> 00:58:28,380
know you and your husband David are

1209
00:58:25,559 --> 00:58:31,340
working on another book I was curious

1210
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:34,829
what role cannabis might play in that

1211
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:36,510
yeah we think so you know not

1212
00:58:34,829 --> 00:58:39,090
surprisingly after writing the hidden

1213
00:58:36,510 --> 00:58:40,680
half of nature and actually call it you

1214
00:58:39,090 --> 00:58:42,150
know there's the dirt trilogy hidden

1215
00:58:40,679 --> 00:58:43,829
half a nature is the middle book and

1216
00:58:42,150 --> 00:58:46,559
dirts the first one and then growing

1217
00:58:43,829 --> 00:58:49,349
revolutions the third one it's odd tad

1218
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:51,869
that despite these three books we have

1219
00:58:49,349 --> 00:58:53,719
not really we've touched on but we have

1220
00:58:51,869 --> 00:58:58,349
not really taken a deep dive into

1221
00:58:53,719 --> 00:59:00,899
exploring the question of does does soil

1222
00:58:58,349 --> 00:59:03,539
health affect and influence human health

1223
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:06,840
and if so how what are some of those

1224
00:59:03,539 --> 00:59:08,429
connections and relationships anyone

1225
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:12,059
listening to this podcast anyone who

1226
00:59:08,429 --> 00:59:14,399
talks to me will know that yes and and

1227
00:59:12,059 --> 00:59:16,500
and day for that matter think that there

1228
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:18,240
definitely are some connections but what

1229
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:22,349
we want to do is dig deep into the

1230
00:59:18,239 --> 00:59:25,259
science and bring the story to readers

1231
00:59:22,349 --> 00:59:28,519
in ways that are you know entertaining

1232
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:33,860
and informative and there's two crops

1233
00:59:28,519 --> 00:59:37,099
I'll call them crops that we think it's

1234
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:40,559
every bit as legitimate to talk about

1235
00:59:37,099 --> 00:59:42,630
cannabis and wine grapes in the same

1236
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:45,630
breath as we talk about our food crops

1237
00:59:42,630 --> 00:59:51,269
and the connections between soil health

1238
00:59:45,630 --> 00:59:55,410
and human health because wine grapes and

1239
00:59:51,269 --> 00:59:57,840
cannabis are part of the botanical world

1240
00:59:55,409 --> 01:00:02,849
in one way or another we bring the

1241
00:59:57,840 --> 01:00:05,370
tissues and products that we make from

1242
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:07,589
those plants into our bodies

1243
01:00:05,369 --> 01:00:09,269
and we know they're doing things inside

1244
01:00:07,590 --> 01:00:13,789
of our bodies and so it stands to reason

1245
01:00:09,269 --> 01:00:16,590
then that what is how we cultivate

1246
01:00:13,789 --> 01:00:21,750
cannabis specifically what does that

1247
01:00:16,590 --> 01:00:23,760
have to do with the quality of the

1248
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:25,679
products that we're using whether it's

1249
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:26,910
medicinal or recreational or

1250
01:00:25,679 --> 01:00:30,000
what-have-you

1251
01:00:26,909 --> 01:00:35,129
so that so we wanted we want to take a

1252
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:37,619
look at that as I think with cannabis

1253
01:00:35,130 --> 01:00:39,150
you know the trajectory despite I think

1254
01:00:37,619 --> 01:00:42,239
what's going on at the national level

1255
01:00:39,150 --> 01:00:45,180
I just think cannabis is going to be

1256
01:00:42,239 --> 01:00:48,539
come legal in more and more states and I

1257
01:00:45,179 --> 01:00:51,839
think consumers to have resources at

1258
01:00:48,539 --> 01:00:56,969
hand to know how is this cannabis grown

1259
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:59,370
and also to educate consumers to about

1260
01:00:56,969 --> 01:01:02,179
sort of the role of phytochemicals in a

1261
01:00:59,369 --> 01:01:04,529
plant's body and how that translates to

1262
01:01:02,179 --> 01:01:07,500
the desired effects whether you're

1263
01:01:04,530 --> 01:01:08,910
looking for some kind of couch walking

1264
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:10,559
or whether you're looking for something

1265
01:01:08,909 --> 01:01:12,119
more clear-headed or whether you're

1266
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:16,230
looking for something on the medicinal

1267
01:01:12,119 --> 01:01:19,889
and that's that's all really important

1268
01:01:16,230 --> 01:01:21,360
and we hope in the new book to sort of

1269
01:01:19,889 --> 01:01:25,500
spill the beans so to speak on that

1270
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:27,710
story so whether it's terroir that

1271
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:30,090
you're talking about with wine grapes or

1272
01:01:27,710 --> 01:01:32,730
cannabinoids and Turkey an expression

1273
01:01:30,090 --> 01:01:35,579
with cannabis really it's a mat it's a

1274
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:38,579
combination of that sort of relationship

1275
01:01:35,579 --> 01:01:42,449
between nutrient content and soil health

1276
01:01:38,579 --> 01:01:44,880
and the microbiome in the rhizosphere

1277
01:01:42,449 --> 01:01:47,149
and how all these interact these complex

1278
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:49,920
interactions are occurring that creates

1279
01:01:47,150 --> 01:01:51,900
sort of that final plant tissue or fruit

1280
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:55,320
that we're that we're consuming

1281
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:57,119
ourselves right yeah I would just add to

1282
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:59,760
that what I'm seeing with these living

1283
01:01:57,119 --> 01:02:01,679
soils and getting feedback from some of

1284
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:04,320
the growers that we work with is higher

1285
01:02:01,679 --> 01:02:06,599
levels of terpenes down there seeing

1286
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:10,289
traditionally across the same cultivar

1287
01:02:06,599 --> 01:02:12,809
so it used to be in the medical days

1288
01:02:10,289 --> 01:02:15,269
here in Washington that you would go

1289
01:02:12,809 --> 01:02:15,840
into a store and they would just say

1290
01:02:15,269 --> 01:02:17,400
here

1291
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:19,620
you know this is what they have and it

1292
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:21,119
would be let's just say oh gee cush is

1293
01:02:19,619 --> 01:02:23,369
one of the names of one of the cultivars

1294
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:24,779
for example and so you would just get

1295
01:02:23,369 --> 01:02:27,659
you would get that there wasn't a lot of

1296
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:30,210
test results you weren't talking about

1297
01:02:27,659 --> 01:02:32,369
the you know odors and flavors of the

1298
01:02:30,210 --> 01:02:33,990
crop it was just it is what it was it

1299
01:02:32,369 --> 01:02:35,670
was just the name sort of thing and now

1300
01:02:33,989 --> 01:02:37,889
you'll see different growers growing the

1301
01:02:35,670 --> 01:02:41,340
same cultivar and getting very different

1302
01:02:37,889 --> 01:02:45,449
results and before I think it used to be

1303
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:47,460
more about just THC levels like people

1304
01:02:45,449 --> 01:02:48,989
would get in trouble for carrying high

1305
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:50,579
amounts of cannabis on them so they want

1306
01:02:48,989 --> 01:02:53,399
to carry less cannabis so they'd want

1307
01:02:50,579 --> 01:02:55,860
stronger cannabis so they could carry

1308
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:58,800
less of it you know if they can get 20%

1309
01:02:55,860 --> 01:03:00,450
THC versus 10 percent THC they could

1310
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:03,180
carry half the amount or you know

1311
01:03:00,449 --> 01:03:08,669
consume half the amount so now what

1312
01:03:03,179 --> 01:03:10,440
we're finding is the as the as the sort

1313
01:03:08,670 --> 01:03:12,720
of the community evolves and is the laws

1314
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:15,240
change people are more interested in

1315
01:03:12,719 --> 01:03:19,169
these terpene levels that were they're

1316
01:03:15,239 --> 01:03:21,899
testing for and how they affect the not

1317
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:26,940
only the psychoactive effects of

1318
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:28,710
cannabis but also the you know the the I

1319
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:31,650
guess I would say the recreational

1320
01:03:28,710 --> 01:03:33,329
process of consuming it which is you

1321
01:03:31,650 --> 01:03:36,630
know similar to wine in the way that we

1322
01:03:33,329 --> 01:03:38,219
evaluate it in terms of how when

1323
01:03:36,630 --> 01:03:40,890
described it so I think that that's

1324
01:03:38,219 --> 01:03:43,500
really interesting as you know as the

1325
01:03:40,889 --> 01:03:46,379
industry evolves yeah you know what I

1326
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:50,659
think would be really really fun in the

1327
01:03:46,380 --> 01:03:58,050
future to do is to have you know we have

1328
01:03:50,659 --> 01:04:00,920
there's cannabis cannabis tasting events

1329
01:03:58,050 --> 01:04:03,870
like the Emerald cup I think is one and

1330
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:06,420
there's wine tasting events and there's

1331
01:04:03,869 --> 01:04:09,960
tomato tasting events I think it would

1332
01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:13,349
be great to organize an event not based

1333
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:15,539
on these crops but hey let's have let's

1334
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:19,739
have an event about all of the wonderful

1335
01:04:15,539 --> 01:04:21,659
edibles and quaffable 'he's from the

1336
01:04:19,739 --> 01:04:25,079
whole botanical world and so it would be

1337
01:04:21,659 --> 01:04:27,389
an event on phytochemicals like okay we

1338
01:04:25,079 --> 01:04:29,639
know this tomato has you know

1339
01:04:27,389 --> 01:04:32,699
particularly high levels of like

1340
01:04:29,639 --> 01:04:37,230
okay tasters you know what do you think

1341
01:04:32,699 --> 01:04:38,159
and then also be having it the same kind

1342
01:04:37,230 --> 01:04:40,528
of thing okay what about the

1343
01:04:38,159 --> 01:04:42,989
phytochemicals in you know the wines

1344
01:04:40,528 --> 01:04:44,309
what are what are we what can we

1345
01:04:42,989 --> 01:04:47,220
associate with these and what about

1346
01:04:44,309 --> 01:04:49,349
these phytochemicals in cannabis and I

1347
01:04:47,219 --> 01:04:57,238
think I think in modern life were just

1348
01:04:49,349 --> 01:05:00,809
so disconnected from not only how we

1349
01:04:57,239 --> 01:05:04,499
grow our food but you know what this

1350
01:05:00,809 --> 01:05:07,650
whole endeavor of agriculture is is and

1351
01:05:04,498 --> 01:05:09,598
has been all about I mean sure it was

1352
01:05:07,650 --> 01:05:11,789
always about survival in getting enough

1353
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:15,059
to eat that's that's obvious but

1354
01:05:11,789 --> 01:05:19,710
certainly at another level part of all

1355
01:05:15,059 --> 01:05:22,920
of this is about pleasure and it's about

1356
01:05:19,710 --> 01:05:27,989
fun and it's about flavor and taste and

1357
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:30,659
effect and being knowledgeable enough to

1358
01:05:27,989 --> 01:05:33,539
know okay yeah right okay I've had

1359
01:05:30,659 --> 01:05:35,730
enough of sugar or I've had enough okay

1360
01:05:33,539 --> 01:05:38,430
no more no more cannabis for me or you

1361
01:05:35,730 --> 01:05:40,498
know no more wine for me so I actually

1362
01:05:38,429 --> 01:05:43,909
think if people were more educated about

1363
01:05:40,498 --> 01:05:50,608
the effects of all of these botanical

1364
01:05:43,909 --> 01:05:52,558
foods beverages and so on it would be it

1365
01:05:50,608 --> 01:05:54,838
would it would be I think I don't know a

1366
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:57,450
more interesting way to move our way

1367
01:05:54,838 --> 01:06:00,900
through the world of a grocery store of

1368
01:05:57,449 --> 01:06:03,210
farmers markets you know a party you

1369
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:05,068
know having guests over and so on I mean

1370
01:06:03,210 --> 01:06:08,699
there's there's there's no doubt in my

1371
01:06:05,068 --> 01:06:13,130
mind that humanity has long long flocked

1372
01:06:08,699 --> 01:06:18,210
toward you know things like sugar and

1373
01:06:13,130 --> 01:06:20,880
alcohol and and getting high it's a

1374
01:06:18,210 --> 01:06:22,588
matter of okay well let's let's take the

1375
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:25,588
pleasure from that but let's not overdo

1376
01:06:22,588 --> 01:06:27,838
it yeah I think it's interesting as

1377
01:06:25,588 --> 01:06:29,849
someone who works around a lot of

1378
01:06:27,838 --> 01:06:31,889
chickens as a farmer we find that they

1379
01:06:29,849 --> 01:06:35,309
can regulate their calcium levels we can

1380
01:06:31,889 --> 01:06:37,798
just put out eggshell or oyster shells

1381
01:06:35,309 --> 01:06:39,809
and they will they will regulate that

1382
01:06:37,798 --> 01:06:39,960
based on I need it you know what they

1383
01:06:39,809 --> 01:06:41,760
need

1384
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:43,829
Wow 16 did

1385
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:46,200
you know I think it's 16 18 percent

1386
01:06:43,829 --> 01:06:47,400
calcium in their diet or maybe it's

1387
01:06:46,199 --> 01:06:51,149
protein I might be confusing the two

1388
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:53,010
right now but basically you don't have

1389
01:06:51,150 --> 01:06:54,480
to regulate that for them and I think we

1390
01:06:53,010 --> 01:06:57,030
do the same in terms of our own needs

1391
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:59,969
like when we crave sugary foods or salty

1392
01:06:57,030 --> 01:07:03,950
foods based on what what our bodies may

1393
01:06:59,969 --> 01:07:07,369
need but interestingly enough I met with

1394
01:07:03,949 --> 01:07:09,960
Tom Wagner who's a local plant breeder

1395
01:07:07,369 --> 01:07:13,230
specifically known for tomatoes and

1396
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:16,199
potatoes Green Zebra being one of the

1397
01:07:13,230 --> 01:07:18,539
ones locally here that's oh yeah that

1398
01:07:16,199 --> 01:07:21,779
he's created and what he's really

1399
01:07:18,539 --> 01:07:24,300
interested in is Tomatoes with high

1400
01:07:21,780 --> 01:07:25,019
protein content which is associated with

1401
01:07:24,300 --> 01:07:29,220
the flavor

1402
01:07:25,019 --> 01:07:31,829
umami oh wow they've found this

1403
01:07:29,219 --> 01:07:34,230
association between the umami flavoring

1404
01:07:31,829 --> 01:07:37,170
and protein so he's purposely breeding

1405
01:07:34,230 --> 01:07:39,570
for tomatoes with higher umami levels as

1406
01:07:37,170 --> 01:07:42,480
a way of flavoring as a way of selecting

1407
01:07:39,570 --> 01:07:45,180
for higher protein so I thought that was

1408
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:48,119
interesting you know that is really that

1409
01:07:45,179 --> 01:07:52,219
is really interesting and it's it's also

1410
01:07:48,119 --> 01:07:59,909
interesting to me because of the ability

1411
01:07:52,219 --> 01:08:05,519
for us as as human beings to equate

1412
01:07:59,909 --> 01:08:07,109
flavor with quality and right proteins

1413
01:08:05,519 --> 01:08:10,170
protein is an important thing that our

1414
01:08:07,110 --> 01:08:14,099
bodies have and umami is a flavor that

1415
01:08:10,170 --> 01:08:18,619
we like and so voila the two come

1416
01:08:14,099 --> 01:08:24,088
together and we're consuming a diet of

1417
01:08:18,619 --> 01:08:25,229
food that is actually good for us yeah

1418
01:08:24,088 --> 01:08:28,798
I'll have to put you in touch with them

1419
01:08:25,229 --> 01:08:31,219
I think you guys might yeah yeah yeah

1420
01:08:28,798 --> 01:08:37,039
this whole I've been reading this

1421
01:08:31,220 --> 01:08:40,949
reading some books on wine lately and

1422
01:08:37,039 --> 01:08:44,960
the whole way in which I recently

1423
01:08:40,949 --> 01:08:47,189
learned for example next time

1424
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:50,960
Ted or listeners whoever's out there

1425
01:08:47,189 --> 01:08:54,289
next time you take you're drinking wine

1426
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:55,500
take in the equivalent of about a

1427
01:08:54,289 --> 01:08:57,390
teaspoon

1428
01:08:55,500 --> 01:09:00,810
of the wine and don't immediately

1429
01:08:57,390 --> 01:09:03,600
swallow it but imagine its food and kind

1430
01:09:00,810 --> 01:09:06,270
of chew on it and it pushes the wine

1431
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:09,150
into all these parts of your mouth and

1432
01:09:06,270 --> 01:09:13,860
you're sort of back at the throat area

1433
01:09:09,149 --> 01:09:15,629
and it hits taste receptors that I

1434
01:09:13,859 --> 01:09:20,039
didn't even knew I didn't even know I

1435
01:09:15,630 --> 01:09:22,829
had and the wine washes over these taste

1436
01:09:20,039 --> 01:09:26,159
receptors and it tastes completely

1437
01:09:22,829 --> 01:09:28,319
different than the normal way of just

1438
01:09:26,159 --> 01:09:32,420
sort of pulling in them out you know

1439
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:36,449
some wine and swallowing it and it was

1440
01:09:32,420 --> 01:09:39,869
it it had it completely the flavor of

1441
01:09:36,449 --> 01:09:43,069
the wine like I'm like wow I'm actually

1442
01:09:39,869 --> 01:09:45,750
tasting this wine I never I know I don't

1443
01:09:43,069 --> 01:09:50,279
it was a whole new experience and

1444
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:54,689
because we chew on food we are probably

1445
01:09:50,279 --> 01:09:58,259
hitting more taste receptors with food

1446
01:09:54,689 --> 01:10:01,409
than we are with the things that that we

1447
01:09:58,260 --> 01:10:03,329
drink so anyway I just recommend that to

1448
01:10:01,409 --> 01:10:06,300
people and see what you think about it

1449
01:10:03,329 --> 01:10:09,569
you'll find how many different flavors

1450
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:11,699
there are and wine and it also makes me

1451
01:10:09,569 --> 01:10:15,809
think about the phytochemicals in wine

1452
01:10:11,699 --> 01:10:19,260
and what what's going on with them as

1453
01:10:15,810 --> 01:10:22,200
they you know pass through your mouth

1454
01:10:19,260 --> 01:10:25,380
and then further on down in the gut so

1455
01:10:22,199 --> 01:10:29,489
really really interesting connections

1456
01:10:25,380 --> 01:10:32,819
between phytochemicals flavor nutrition

1457
01:10:29,489 --> 01:10:37,559
and health and wellness and I think I

1458
01:10:32,819 --> 01:10:39,539
know there's books out there people have

1459
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:44,100
talked about you know part of the

1460
01:10:39,539 --> 01:10:46,109
purpose of taste receptors in our body

1461
01:10:44,100 --> 01:10:51,560
and actually receptors in our gut as

1462
01:10:46,109 --> 01:10:54,299
well on on cells is to pick up

1463
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:57,510
specifically on phytochemicals because

1464
01:10:54,300 --> 01:11:01,110
they're interacting biochemically with

1465
01:10:57,510 --> 01:11:04,980
our bodies in all kinds of ways all

1466
01:11:01,109 --> 01:11:07,769
kinds of ways yeah it's a it's a

1467
01:11:04,979 --> 01:11:09,099
fascinating topic one of the books I

1468
01:11:07,770 --> 01:11:10,930
really enjoyed you might want to check

1469
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:13,690
is called proof it's by a gentleman

1470
01:11:10,930 --> 01:11:17,380
named Adam Rogers okay he looks at the

1471
01:11:13,689 --> 01:11:19,710
science of booze and that's one of the

1472
01:11:17,380 --> 01:11:23,640
one of the things he talks about is how

1473
01:11:19,710 --> 01:11:27,159
how we evaluate wine and just how

1474
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:28,630
qualitative that process is it's pretty

1475
01:11:27,159 --> 01:11:30,909
interesting I think I think you'll

1476
01:11:28,630 --> 01:11:33,550
really enjoy it yeah I will send you a

1477
01:11:30,909 --> 01:11:34,510
link to that as well but cool thanks

1478
01:11:33,550 --> 01:11:36,190
again for your time today

1479
01:11:34,510 --> 01:11:38,770
I enjoyed chatting it's such a beautiful

1480
01:11:36,189 --> 01:11:39,909
Seattle day that we get so rarely here I

1481
01:11:38,770 --> 01:11:42,070
feel like we should get off the phone

1482
01:11:39,909 --> 01:11:44,409
and allow you to get back outside of

1483
01:11:42,069 --> 01:11:46,960
your garden get out to the garden get

1484
01:11:44,409 --> 01:11:49,109
your hands in the soil yeah okay that

1485
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:52,329
that sounds good Chad yeah I've really

1486
01:11:49,109 --> 01:11:56,229
really enjoyed this I love talking about

1487
01:11:52,329 --> 01:11:59,289
as you can tell I like I like microbes

1488
01:11:56,229 --> 01:12:01,509
and soil and plants and the human body

1489
01:11:59,289 --> 01:12:04,029
and how we're living on this planet and

1490
01:12:01,510 --> 01:12:06,430
can take better care of it yes so just

1491
01:12:04,029 --> 01:12:09,340
just to summarize your big takeaways

1492
01:12:06,430 --> 01:12:11,170
would be for people to however their

1493
01:12:09,340 --> 01:12:13,180
gardening is to increase their amount of

1494
01:12:11,170 --> 01:12:15,220
organic matter in their soils in the

1495
01:12:13,180 --> 01:12:20,619
form of mulching which has a bunch of

1496
01:12:15,220 --> 01:12:22,810
benefits and then also not overdo it

1497
01:12:20,619 --> 01:12:25,960
allow the plant to sort of reach their

1498
01:12:22,810 --> 01:12:27,970
own genetic potential without without

1499
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:30,189
pushing them too hard in the traditional

1500
01:12:27,970 --> 01:12:34,539
garden is that is there anything else

1501
01:12:30,189 --> 01:12:38,829
yeah no those are great that that's that

1502
01:12:34,539 --> 01:12:41,500
is exactly it and and I would just say

1503
01:12:38,829 --> 01:12:44,800
one last thing that we didn't we didn't

1504
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:47,590
hit on but I think about in the context

1505
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:50,110
of not pushing your plants too far and

1506
01:12:47,590 --> 01:12:53,860
the organic matter is to realize that

1507
01:12:50,109 --> 01:12:56,739
the soil has a metabolism I think of it

1508
01:12:53,859 --> 01:13:01,949
as a metabolism just like our body does

1509
01:12:56,739 --> 01:13:06,189
and overwhelming the body of soil with

1510
01:13:01,949 --> 01:13:08,739
too much of any one thing is what we

1511
01:13:06,189 --> 01:13:11,500
want to you know veer away from is it's

1512
01:13:08,739 --> 01:13:14,739
sort of like you know even too much

1513
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:16,149
mulch too much organic matter the soil

1514
01:13:14,739 --> 01:13:18,309
can't handle all of that it's like

1515
01:13:16,149 --> 01:13:20,859
sitting down to you know instead of one

1516
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:22,920
plate at dinner like three platefuls you

1517
01:13:20,859 --> 01:13:26,279
just you're going to feel not

1518
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:28,529
and overfed and it's just not going to

1519
01:13:26,279 --> 01:13:30,929
just not going to work well so being

1520
01:13:28,529 --> 01:13:33,899
mindful of the soils ability and the

1521
01:13:30,929 --> 01:13:37,109
microorganisms in the soil to process

1522
01:13:33,899 --> 01:13:39,089
that organic matter in a in a timely

1523
01:13:37,109 --> 01:13:42,149
fashion and I I think they're sort of

1524
01:13:39,090 --> 01:13:45,869
like the secret mission of the natural

1525
01:13:42,149 --> 01:13:48,689
world is if a gardener is paying

1526
01:13:45,869 --> 01:13:51,300
attention to the metabolism of their

1527
01:13:48,689 --> 01:13:53,219
soil it also keeps that gardener

1528
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:54,750
connected to the natural world right

1529
01:13:53,219 --> 01:13:57,000
because you've got to be out there sort

1530
01:13:54,750 --> 01:13:59,279
of checking on that metabolism a little

1531
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:03,510
too much here oh we need a little more

1532
01:13:59,279 --> 01:14:05,789
over there and so it it I I think about

1533
01:14:03,510 --> 01:14:08,520
maybe a gardener as being more maybe

1534
01:14:05,789 --> 01:14:10,590
something more like a shepherd tending

1535
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:15,090
its flock it's just that our flocks are

1536
01:14:10,590 --> 01:14:18,210
green and stuck in place so we need to

1537
01:14:15,090 --> 01:14:20,819
sort of herd them along with the things

1538
01:14:18,210 --> 01:14:24,689
that we know about what they like and

1539
01:14:20,819 --> 01:14:27,448
how their bodies work great well again

1540
01:14:24,689 --> 01:14:28,979
