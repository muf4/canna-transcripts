1
00:00:04,278 --> 00:00:07,560
all right I'm here with Charles with emo

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:10,120
and one of the questions I've been asked

3
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:12,599
a lot about the product rout that's used

4
00:00:10,119 --> 00:00:15,119
for propagation is can I use it in a

5
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:18,399
cloner uh can you go ahead and answer

6
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:20,320
that for us please yeah absolutely dad U

7
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:24,640
so the short answer is yes absolutely

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:27,560
you can use root um in a cloner um you

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:30,800
do want to of course make sure that you

10
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:34,479
are um introducing root in a way that is

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:37,960
going to uh give the microbes some time

12
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:39,359
to um form the symbiotic relationship

13
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,799
with the plan and and really be

14
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:44,320
introduced in a way that sets them up

15
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:47,919
for Success so um we do recommend

16
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:51,960
dipping in root um before putting into

17
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:55,160
the cloner um not adding root into the

18
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:59,359
res um some Growers like to actually

19
00:00:55,159 --> 00:01:02,198
leave their cuting in root um for you

20
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,680
know a a few minutes before putting them

21
00:01:02,198 --> 00:01:06,239
into the cloner um as I said before I

22
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,360
kind of really give the the microbes a

23
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:12,000
chance to to get involved get that gel

24
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:14,959
um nice and you know coated on the end

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,400
of The Cutting uh I think you know the

26
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:20,000
reason that people tend to wonder about

27
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:22,640
the the um introduction of of root in

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,560
the cloner is um thinking that it's

29
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:29,280
going to wash away uh as soon as the the

30
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,478
cuting are put into the cloner and so

31
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,719
again one way

32
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:37,438
to just kind of balance that out is to

33
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:39,200
uh do the dip before putting them in and

34
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:42,679
uh potentially leaving leaving the

35
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,240
cuting in uh a cup with roots uh for a

36
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,479
couple minutes before putting them in

37
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:47,879
your

38
00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:49,200
cloner and then I assume Clean cleaning

39
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:51,759
the cloner really well at the end of the

40
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,280
cycle to avoid any bofilm buildup

41
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,959
absolutely absolutely always want to you

42
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,759
know make sure you're you're doing uh

43
00:01:55,959 --> 00:02:01,158
those sorts of best practices to to

44
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,599
clean clean the cloner um

45
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:05,320
uh of course you're you're introducing

46
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:08,118
beneficials with root and you want to do

47
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:10,399
that in in a way that's going to create

48
00:02:08,118 --> 00:02:12,878
the most benefit for your plant uh but

49
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:15,759
then to make sure you're kind of uh

50
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:17,479
doing a thorough clean in between runs

51
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:18,479
uh so you don't have anything hanging

52
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:22,199
around

53
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:24,840
there and for Growers that are using uh

54
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:28,479
some sort of product for sterilization

55
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:31,479
like bleach zerol hyen peroxide based

56
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:33,318
things um how how should how would you

57
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:35,799
best incorporate something like that

58
00:02:33,318 --> 00:02:38,719
into using a product like

59
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,959
root yeah absolutely so of course

60
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:42,359
understand a lot of Growers you know

61
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:45,680
want to make sure they're taking as many

62
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,840
precautions as possible to um you know

63
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,159
reduce pathogen risk in their cloning

64
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,319
operation and you can absolutely use

65
00:02:50,158 --> 00:02:54,799
those sterilization products in

66
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:56,518
combination with with root but the key

67
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,439
thing is that it's it's not a direct

68
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:01,080
combination right because those um those

69
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:04,280
products of course are designed to kill

70
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:07,519
microbes and so they will interfere with

71
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:09,919
root if you mix them directly together

72
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,439
um so if you're using a sterilization

73
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:16,318
product we would recommend having a

74
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:18,439
water dip step between you know taking

75
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:21,079
something out of your cup of of hydrogen

76
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:23,598
peroxide and going into root again

77
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,400
before you you make that transition you

78
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:27,479
want to take it out of your cup of of

79
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,760
hydrogen peroxide or wherever whatever

80
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:32,798
sterilization product you might be using

81
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:34,759
dunk it in water and then put it into

82
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:38,360
root um so you're not getting that

83
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:40,719
sterilization product directly into um

84
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:43,720
root do you have any tips or tricks

85
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:45,438
regarding mixing root because we when we

86
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:48,359
receive it I realize it's going to be a

87
00:03:45,438 --> 00:03:51,598
powder um how do we how do we best make

88
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:54,439
it into a gel for utilizing U with our

89
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:57,399
plants with our cuting yeah absolutely

90
00:03:54,438 --> 00:03:59,078
and as as you know Tad we we put the

91
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:02,519
microbes in powder form because that's

92
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:06,719
the best way to keep them um stable uh

93
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:10,400
and and uh avoid anything uh damaging

94
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:12,598
the microbial consortia in transit um

95
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,840
but of course that means also waking the

96
00:04:12,598 --> 00:04:17,719
microbes back up mixing that powder with

97
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,319
water um to turn turn root into the gel

98
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,600
that you ultimately want to

99
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:24,319
use couple things I would recommend

100
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,879
there um one is that if you notice you

101
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:29,240
know any kind of clumpiness in the

102
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:30,600
powder um when you open up the pouch uh

103
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,240
we would recommend you know seeing what

104
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:35,879
you can do to kind of break up the

105
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:38,879
chunks before you mix it in with water

106
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:41,959
um I'd also mention that water excuse me

107
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:44,478
warmer water um is easier for that

108
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:46,079
mixing you don't want to use hot water

109
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:49,360
right really hot water like boiling

110
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:51,758
water will will um damage the microbes

111
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:55,038
but warmer water will help the gel to

112
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:57,520
dissolve a little bit more easily um and

113
00:04:55,038 --> 00:05:00,120
we're actually finding that um it looks

114
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:04,560
like the the mixing process is a little

115
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:07,160
easier if you uh pour the powder into um

116
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:10,319
the glass that we include uh to kind of

117
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:13,120
mix things up first and then add water

118
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:14,959
to the filthy here line as opposed to

119
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,478
filling up your glass jar and then

120
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:21,279
adding the the uh microbes to the

121
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:25,800
water and just one one one quick

122
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:26,839
addition to that um it the uh sometimes

123
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,000
you will still see a little bit of

124
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:31,799
clumpiness um when that gel is forming

125
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,279
but even the bigger clumps will will

126
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,400
ultimately um get incorporated into the

127
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:39,159
solution is is what we see and what we

128
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:40,959
hear from Growers um so sometimes just a

129
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,039
little bit more time um and you'll end

130
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:44,159
up with that nice gel consistency that

131
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:46,759
that we

132
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,759
expect and just from my experience with

133
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:51,479
compost teas and microbes I assume it

134
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:55,639
it's perfectly okay to shake the glass

135
00:05:51,478 --> 00:05:59,519
jar pretty vigorously to get good mixing

136
00:05:55,639 --> 00:06:01,639
yes 100% um good thorough Shake is is

137
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:04,599
definitely uh the way to

138
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:06,199
go all right cool anything else you

139
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:09,599
wanted to cover

140
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:12,360
today no you know I just say again I

141
00:06:09,598 --> 00:06:14,519
appreciate the the questions that we've

142
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,879
been getting around root um you know

143
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:19,198
glad that there's a lot of excitement

144
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:22,598
around a you know microbial alternative

145
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:25,400
uh for for uh cloning and um don't

146
00:06:22,598 --> 00:06:27,959
hesitate to to reach out to us um you

147
