1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,359
I've just come to the realization how

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:07,120
how important it is to test your soil at

3
00:00:04,359 --> 00:00:09,879
the same time like so we test we kind of

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:12,320
follow what your guys' sop so just for

5
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:15,719
the audience we work very closely with

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:20,000
Tad and his team with Brandon uh we

7
00:00:15,718 --> 00:00:22,439
submit a soil sample around uh after 8

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,679
weeks in flour so we're kind of getting

9
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:28,160
the same snapshot in time of where rooms

10
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:30,518
are we try to take different points in

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,640
the room just to try to get a general

12
00:00:30,518 --> 00:00:35,920
idea um and then we go off of uh

13
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,239
Brandon's recommendations or working

14
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,000
with them being like hey we need to get

15
00:00:37,238 --> 00:00:44,759
our yields up can we bump you know X Y

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,679
or Z up um so I think it's uh super

17
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:49,159
critical especially in a commercial

18
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:52,320
setting where you're trying to hit

19
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:54,759
certain metrics um you need to be doing

20
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,920
soil testing and you need to be making

21
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:58,920
sure that the inputs that you're using

22
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:01,920
are uh clean and

23
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,920
tested
