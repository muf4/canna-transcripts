1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:06,640
when to put blue mats in again that's

2
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:09,718
going to depend heavily on how much

3
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:11,638
water you're adding pre during post

4
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:13,080
transplant and then you're really just

5
00:00:11,638 --> 00:00:16,278
going to want to keep an eye on the

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:19,359
moisture levels in the you know whether

7
00:00:16,278 --> 00:00:22,000
you want to spot check like randomly so

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,118
go to a container or a bed and just say

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,599
literally throw a dart and be like I

10
00:00:24,118 --> 00:00:28,920
want to know what it is here and then I

11
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:30,879
want to know what it is here um and then

12
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,439
another really

13
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:36,079
valuable method to doing to keeping an

14
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:39,199
iron moisture level is you know get like

15
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,799
a plastic uh Chopstick and put a little

16
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,280
piece of flagging tape on it and just

17
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:44,799
stick it in the bed or in a container

18
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,840
somewhere at the exact same spot and

19
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:48,238
then that's your sensing spot so every

20
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,280
time you want to take a mo you know a

21
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:52,919
soil moisture reading if you've got a

22
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,439
meter you go right topstick put it in

23
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,719
the exact same spot so that way you have

24
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:59,558
a consistently consistent spot to get a

25
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:00,679
sense of how fast water might be moving

26
00:00:59,558 --> 00:01:03,518
through

27
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:05,198
um so there's there's there's pros and

28
00:01:03,518 --> 00:01:06,798
cons to both of those different methods

29
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:08,640
as far as figuring out exactly what your

30
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,040
soil moisture is and when to install

31
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,040
blue m
