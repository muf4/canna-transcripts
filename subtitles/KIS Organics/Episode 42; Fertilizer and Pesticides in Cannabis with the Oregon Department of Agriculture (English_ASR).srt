00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:20,009
welcome to the cannabis cultivation and

3
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:22,559
science podcast

4
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:25,230
I'm your host tad hussy of KISS organics

5
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:27,000
this is the podcast where we discuss the

6
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:29,160
cutting edge of organic growing from a

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,839
science-based perspective and drawn top

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,179
experts from around the industry to

9
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:34,979
share their wisdom and knowledge as you

10
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:36,929
know rules and regulations are an

11
00:00:34,979 --> 00:00:39,269
important aspect of cannabis cultivation

12
00:00:36,929 --> 00:00:40,979
in addition it's important to note that

13
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,660
the products we purchase to use in our

14
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:44,488
garden are safe and providing the

15
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:46,738
nutrients or microbes that are listed on

16
00:00:44,488 --> 00:00:48,599
the labels my interview this week is

17
00:00:46,738 --> 00:00:50,968
with sunny summers and Matt Haynes with

18
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,590
the Oregon Department of Agriculture the

19
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:54,210
Oregon Department of Agriculture have

20
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,590
been leaders at the state level in

21
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:58,020
regards to product testing and

22
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,399
information sharing for consumers I was

23
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,530
very excited that they accepted my

24
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,179
request to come on the podcast to talk

25
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,609
about some of their findings and to help

26
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:07,769
growers better understand pesticide and

27
00:01:05,609 --> 00:01:09,859
fertilizer product labels and some of

28
00:01:07,769 --> 00:01:12,420
the challenges around policy enforcement

29
00:01:09,859 --> 00:01:14,938
to give a little background on my guests

30
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,769
at a personal level sunny summers is the

31
00:01:14,938 --> 00:01:18,868

she worked in pesticide regulation and

36
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,680
enforcement for 12 years before making

37
00:01:26,609 --> 00:01:30,930
the leap to cannabis when not scratching

38
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,100
her head over cannabis regulations she

39
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:34,079
can be found napping in the woods

40
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:35,459

hi Matt and sunny thanks so much for

57
00:02:10,629 --> 00:02:16,000
coming on the show today good to be here

58

tad yeah thank you yeah can you tell me

59
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,840
a little bit more about your roles at

60
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:23,860
the Oda and some of the programs that

61
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:26,080
you're involved in yeah I'll start so

62
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:29,530
this is sunny I am the Oregon Department

63
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:32,410
of bags cannabis policy coordinator so

64
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:36,069
for me that involves marijuana and

65
00:02:32,409 --> 00:02:38,020
industrial hemp I currently am helping

66
00:02:36,069 --> 00:02:40,840
write the rules for our industrial hemp

67
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:42,030
program I also work really closely with

68
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,890
the Oregon Liquor Control Commission

69
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:48,340
which has the primary Authority for

70
00:02:44,889 --> 00:02:50,469
adult use cannabis in Oregon I also

71
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:53,289
liaison with the Oregon Health Authority

72
00:02:50,469 --> 00:02:56,889
who does all the medical as well as

73
00:02:53,289 --> 00:03:00,939
testing rules in relations to adult use

74
00:02:56,889 --> 00:03:04,329
cannabis or medical cannabis and then I

75
00:03:00,939 --> 00:03:07,270
also work with the industry helping them

76
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:09,430
figure out who they need to talk to may

77
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:12,370
not be our agency or who within our

78
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:14,230
agency they would need to talk to great

79
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:16,180
and Matt I know I've actually worked

80
00:03:14,229 --> 00:03:19,298
with you in getting some of our soils

81
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:20,890
registered in Oregon a couple years ago

82
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:24,760
can you tell me a little about your role

83
00:03:20,889 --> 00:03:27,029
with Oda sure dad I am with the

84
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:31,509
department's fertilizer program

85
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:33,969
fertilizer regulation is quite old

86
00:03:31,509 --> 00:03:37,120
actually much much older than the

87
00:03:33,969 --> 00:03:39,370
caÃ±ada's program here it goes back to

88
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,640
prior to the creation of the agency

89
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:44,709
which was in the 1930s but my role here

90
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:47,679
is as a fertilizer specialist so I'm

91
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:49,390
reviewing product labeling that is

92
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,849
submitted for registration I'm

93
00:03:49,389 --> 00:03:54,699
conducting marketplace inspections so I

94
00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:55,539
go out in the field and see if folks are

95
00:03:54,699 --> 00:04:00,548
compliant

96
00:03:55,539 --> 00:04:02,229
I also review a lot of lab data that we

97
00:04:00,549 --> 00:04:04,060
generate here internally in the

98
00:04:02,229 --> 00:04:06,479
department for product that's been

99
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:09,489
sampled in the marketplace ultimately

100
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:11,590
the program's goal is consumer

101
00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:14,709
protection we want to make sure that the

102
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:16,509
consumer receives what they what they

103
00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:19,209
pay for and that they don't get things

104
00:04:16,509 --> 00:04:20,529
that they shouldn't have in there

105
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:22,209
that's great I definitely wanted to

106
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:24,250
touch on that a little bit later in the

107
00:04:22,209 --> 00:04:26,349
podcast but I wanted to start off with

108
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:28,750
sort of a general question what sort of

109
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:31,000
challenges do you see for cannabis

110
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:34,959
growers within you know this relatively

111
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,098
new regulated market and sunny I know

112
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:38,739
there's probably been a lot on the

113
00:04:36,098 --> 00:04:41,379
policy side and Matt I know you've seen

114
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:43,000
things with with the fertilizer side is

115
00:04:41,379 --> 00:04:46,659
there anything that that that sort of

116
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:50,079
sparks in terms of particular particular

117
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:53,530
things that you're seeing I I think

118
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:55,810
there's a lot of challenges from the

119
00:04:53,529 --> 00:04:58,029
perspective taking a step back of the

120
00:04:55,810 --> 00:05:01,629
agency we kind of have a dual purpose

121
00:04:58,029 --> 00:05:04,329
here and I think we do it pretty well in

122
00:05:01,629 --> 00:05:07,389
Oregon but the department is tasked with

123
00:05:04,329 --> 00:05:09,848
both regulating the agricultural

124
00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:12,639
industry as well as promoting it and so

125
00:05:09,848 --> 00:05:15,459
the reason my position even exists is

126
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,530
our former director Katie koba was

127
00:05:15,459 --> 00:05:19,959
pretty forward-thinking and really

128
00:05:17,529 --> 00:05:22,179
wanted to treat all things cannabis the

129
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:25,598
same as any other agricultural crop as

130
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:29,019
much as we could so that's where some of

131
00:05:25,598 --> 00:05:32,469
the challenges are I prefer to reframe

132
00:05:29,019 --> 00:05:37,508
endless opportunities come into play

133
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:39,669
you know the olcc for example registers

134
00:05:37,509 --> 00:05:42,189
all growers so we we aren't the ones

135
00:05:39,668 --> 00:05:44,589
that are licensing those those marijuana

136
00:05:42,189 --> 00:05:47,228
growers but yet they still need to work

137
00:05:44,589 --> 00:05:50,109
with us on pesticides and fertilizers

138
00:05:47,228 --> 00:05:54,939
and agricultural water quality programs

139
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:58,629
and so having having to work with

140
00:05:54,939 --> 00:06:00,490
multiple agencies for some people can be

141
00:05:58,629 --> 00:06:04,990
really difficult especially if they are

142
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:07,990
not coming from an Ag background I think

143
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:09,819
that's one of the really awesome things

144
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:13,408
about the cannabis industry is that it's

145
00:06:09,819 --> 00:06:15,699
brought together such a wide range of

146
00:06:13,408 --> 00:06:18,459
people who are interested in the new

147
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:20,620
industry you know I tell co-workers here

148
00:06:18,459 --> 00:06:23,560
we've got our typical tie-dyed

149
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:26,110
Birkenstock wearing folks running the

150
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:28,209
gamut all the way to you know former

151
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:30,550
investment bankers and insurance brokers

152
00:06:28,209 --> 00:06:32,348
people who understand money but don't

153
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:33,119
necessarily understand that agriculture

154
00:06:32,348 --> 00:06:36,699
is not a witch

155
00:06:33,119 --> 00:06:39,129
so I see some some opportunities for

156
00:06:36,699 --> 00:06:42,990
learning in the industry because of

157
00:06:39,129 --> 00:06:45,039
those those situations that's great and

158
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:48,149
Matt was there anything that you wanted

159
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:51,878
to add from the fertilizer perspective

160
00:06:48,149 --> 00:06:54,848
well what what we see over and over

161
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:58,869
again in this in this market is that

162
00:06:54,848 --> 00:07:02,139
you've got a long history of folks that

163
00:06:58,869 --> 00:07:05,129
operate it outside the law and they

164
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:08,680
historically have done this forever and

165
00:07:05,129 --> 00:07:12,278
they have now brought that attitude in

166
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:14,588
or continue that attitude as the legal

167
00:07:12,278 --> 00:07:16,088
framework has been built around the

168
00:07:14,588 --> 00:07:18,309
production of these crops so they

169
00:07:16,088 --> 00:07:20,050
continue and this isn't the grow I don't

170
00:07:18,309 --> 00:07:22,990
really work with growers particularly

171
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:25,028
but I work with input manufacturers and

172
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:29,759
they're continuing a lot of them

173
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:33,218
continue this outlaw or bad-boy attitude

174
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:35,080
and they do things they really should

175
00:07:33,218 --> 00:07:38,228
not be doing

176
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:39,490
but for part of it it it's the way

177
00:07:38,228 --> 00:07:42,098
they've always done business another

178
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:45,069
part of it is it gives them some street

179
00:07:42,098 --> 00:07:46,598
cred hey look our our product works

180
00:07:45,069 --> 00:07:48,669
better than everybody else is because

181
00:07:46,598 --> 00:07:52,028
the the government doesn't know what we

182
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:56,049
do to it so that it's troublesome I

183
00:07:52,028 --> 00:07:58,649
think not in quaint yeah yeah I know I

184
00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:01,689
vented to you in the past about this

185
00:07:58,649 --> 00:08:03,999
because it is really a challenge and I I

186
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:06,309
really appreciate the level of testing

187
00:08:03,999 --> 00:08:09,819
that you are doing I know if we just

188
00:08:06,309 --> 00:08:11,199
talk about fertilizer you released lab

189
00:08:09,819 --> 00:08:11,769
analysis and you've been doing this for

190
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,509
years

191
00:08:11,769 --> 00:08:16,120
even before I believe in before the

192
00:08:13,509 --> 00:08:20,408
cannabis industry came under your your

193
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:22,059
per your your jurisdiction but some of

194
00:08:20,408 --> 00:08:23,558
the some of the products we see what you

195
00:08:22,059 --> 00:08:24,969
talked about there you mentioned is

196
00:08:23,559 --> 00:08:27,729
someone will say yes you know I have

197
00:08:24,968 --> 00:08:29,468
this product it's a oh I don't know

198
00:08:27,728 --> 00:08:31,899
three three two I'm actually looking at

199
00:08:29,468 --> 00:08:35,189
one of your old ones from to in 2015 and

200
00:08:31,899 --> 00:08:37,629
they may say you know our product has a

201
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:39,219
proprietary phosphorus source that

202
00:08:37,629 --> 00:08:41,500
releases the phosphorus much more

203
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:43,990
efficiently than another another product

204
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,938
so you're comparing two three three two

205
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,789
products for example only to find out

206
00:08:45,938 --> 00:08:48,469
that the avail

207
00:08:46,789 --> 00:08:50,480
phosphate that's actually in the product

208
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:53,170
maybe you know instead of three percent

209
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,700
it may be eleven percent so they're

210
00:08:53,169 --> 00:08:57,740
they're essentially making claims around

211
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:59,690
a much higher percentage of nutrient

212
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:02,480
than what they then what they're telling

213
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:04,040
you and from a grower perspective that's

214
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,220
really confusing and it's really

215
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:09,230
challenging because if we're trying to

216
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:11,660
regulate our nutrient and fertigation

217
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:13,310
program to the plant itself we really

218
00:09:11,659 --> 00:09:15,169
can't do that based off of numbers that

219
00:09:13,309 --> 00:09:18,319
are so far off of what we think we're

220
00:09:15,169 --> 00:09:22,299
getting well yeah I would agree with

221
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:25,280
that wholly the fertilizer industry

222
00:09:22,299 --> 00:09:28,909
regulation is it evolved over the last

223
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:32,629
hundred years really was based on making

224
00:09:28,909 --> 00:09:35,480
sure the grower received the minimum

225
00:09:32,629 --> 00:09:37,309
amount that was guaranteed the thought

226
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:40,100
being that nobody's going to give

227
00:09:37,309 --> 00:09:42,079
product away so as long as they get the

228
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:43,100
minimum if they go over well nobody's

229
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,960
going to do that because you're not

230
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:47,930
going to give product away that's losing

231
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:49,879
money but that has changed that dynamics

232
00:09:47,929 --> 00:09:51,589
change quite a bit and there is over

233
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:54,970
formulation and non-disclosed

234
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:57,800
ingredients whether they're nutrients or

235
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:59,540
pesticides and products that may give a

236
00:09:57,799 --> 00:10:02,240
particular product an edge over a

237
00:09:59,539 --> 00:10:04,309
competitor again as Sonny noted with

238
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,870
kind of the wink wink attitude hey check

239
00:10:04,309 --> 00:10:08,449
it out it works we're not going to tell

240
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:11,840
you exactly why but hey it works and it

241
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:14,180
works well so what you guys are doing as

242
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:17,330
an agency is going in and sampling these

243
00:10:14,179 --> 00:10:19,370
products because when I submitted my my

244
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:21,080
product my soil and registered as a

245
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:22,879
fertilizer because I made plant growth

246
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,259
claims saying you know it would help a

247
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:26,539
plant grow therefore it need to be

248
00:10:24,259 --> 00:10:28,730
registered as a fertilizer when I did

249
00:10:26,539 --> 00:10:30,769
that I also had to submit from a lab a

250
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:33,019
guaranteed analysis saying that there

251
00:10:30,769 --> 00:10:34,879
was at least this level of nutrient in

252
00:10:33,019 --> 00:10:37,429
there and then I would set my product

253
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:39,409
label you know slightly below that so

254
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:41,750
let's say we used an example of three

255
00:10:39,409 --> 00:10:43,730
three two that would be something where

256
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:46,669
my analysis might be three point two

257
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:48,200
percent three point one percent and two

258
00:10:46,669 --> 00:10:49,759
point two percent I would say my

259
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,740
products at three three two and then

260
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:53,960
what you're doing is going back in and

261
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:56,629
sampling that product at some point to

262
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:58,940
see if I if I met those guarantees is

263
00:10:56,629 --> 00:11:00,590
that correct yeah that's correct

264
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:04,490
and again like

265
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:05,269
stated previously the the process has

266
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:07,909
been to make sure

267
00:11:05,269 --> 00:11:12,590
okay tag your product met the minimums

268
00:11:07,909 --> 00:11:15,350
and much of much of state regulatory

269
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:17,780
activity has been based on that but

270
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:19,279
we're also starting to go the other

271
00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:23,419
direction now to make sure that you've

272
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:26,839
not over formulated simply for in a

273
00:11:23,419 --> 00:11:29,360
large degree water quality issues if

274
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:31,820
you've got product that's not accurate

275
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:35,149
as to the label and it's being applied

276
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:38,600
over a large swath of ground that can

277
00:11:35,149 --> 00:11:41,209
impact water quality I think that's a

278
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:43,399
really important point especially around

279
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:44,870
the use of phosphorus and phosphates I

280
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:46,779
know that's a big challenge in the

281
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:49,250
cannabis industry as it's something that

282
00:11:46,779 --> 00:11:52,100
in my opinion that we tend to massively

283
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:53,179
over apply and so I think it's great

284
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:56,210
that you're looking out for water

285
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:58,370
quality is there anything else around

286
00:11:56,210 --> 00:12:02,240
fertilizer registration that you would

287
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:04,820
think is important for growers to know

288
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:08,269
from a grower perspective like something

289
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:11,060
that pops into my mind is I wasn't aware

290
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:13,009
that oh you only have to put something

291
00:12:11,059 --> 00:12:14,869
on the label if you're guaranteeing the

292
00:12:13,009 --> 00:12:17,659
analysis of it for example when we're

293
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:20,480
talking about macronutrients I just know

294
00:12:17,659 --> 00:12:22,610
from my label its NPK and calcium I

295
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,680
didn't make a guarantee around sulfur

296
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:27,190
for example so you're not going to test

297
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:29,750
the sulfur in my product is that correct

298
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:32,060
for the most part yes unless there's

299
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:34,309
some reason we would think that it could

300
00:12:32,059 --> 00:12:37,369
be harmful sulfur typically wouldn't be

301
00:12:34,309 --> 00:12:40,609
but you get an element like boron that

302
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:42,289
if that product was well over formulated

303
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:45,169
with boron you could create some

304
00:12:42,289 --> 00:12:49,009
cytotoxic effects that could harm a crop

305
00:12:45,169 --> 00:12:50,809
so we will sometimes look for components

306
00:12:49,009 --> 00:12:53,019
nutritive components that aren't listed

307
00:12:50,809 --> 00:12:55,099
but we may suspect might be a problem

308
00:12:53,019 --> 00:12:57,649
well that's interesting I didn't know

309
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:59,899
that and is this all just random

310
00:12:57,649 --> 00:13:02,149
sampling or is a complaint based as well

311
00:12:59,899 --> 00:13:05,480
how do you go about choosing which

312
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:07,490
products are sampling a lot of it is

313
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:09,500
random as we're in the marketplace

314
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:13,278
conducting inspections will pick up

315
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:16,379
product and then we have a history on

316
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:18,208
that don't necessarily meet their

317
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:21,179
guarantees and we're going to focus in

318
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:23,399
on we're going to focus in on that

319
00:13:21,179 --> 00:13:25,019
manufacturer more if we find that

320
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:27,389
repeatedly they don't meet their

321
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:30,838
guarantees and yeah occasionally we do

322
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:33,799
get complaints whether it's we don't

323
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:36,330
think they're formulating with as much

324
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:38,939
phosphate as they should or they're

325
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:41,190
using a different form or hey by the way

326
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:43,709
I used to work for this company and

327
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:44,880
they're putting SF on in this product

328
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:49,859
you may want to go look at it

329
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:53,700
Wow okay and so take me through what

330
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:56,759
happens if you do find a violation well

331
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:59,520
it often depends on how far up the quote

332
00:13:56,759 --> 00:14:03,088
ladder they are it will start to the

333
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:07,110
point where we take some very low-level

334
00:14:03,089 --> 00:14:08,580
enforcement action as if they repeat we

335
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:10,800
can go up to civil penalty if they

336
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:12,660
continue to repeat we can cancel product

337
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:14,719
registrations and place stop sales on

338
00:14:12,659 --> 00:14:16,980
the product found in the marketplace oh

339
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,680
so it doesn't start with a stop sale

340
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:21,839
that's more on the that's further down

341
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:24,629
the road for laughs yeah for lab

342
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:27,180
violations we always give folks the

343
00:14:24,629 --> 00:14:28,919
benefit of the doubt but as we continue

344
00:14:27,179 --> 00:14:31,769
if we continue to sample and see it

345
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:34,259
violate violate violate yes we can issue

346
00:14:31,769 --> 00:14:36,028
a stop sale which would legally prohibit

347
00:14:34,259 --> 00:14:39,689
the the sale or distribution of the

348
00:14:36,028 --> 00:14:42,689
product in Oregon okay so that's talking

349
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:44,970
fertilizers now if we move to pesticides

350
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:48,180
does that change on the stop sale side

351
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:50,160
of things well so I used to be in the

352
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:53,578
pesticide program it's been a couple of

353
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:55,708
years usually what is going to happen is

354
00:14:53,578 --> 00:14:59,789
if we run into a situation where we

355
00:14:55,708 --> 00:15:01,528
think a pesticide is contaminated or has

356
00:14:59,789 --> 00:15:03,569
an active ingredient that isn't listed

357
00:15:01,528 --> 00:15:06,769
on the label which i think is kind of

358
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:11,430
what you're getting at we're going to go

359
00:15:06,769 --> 00:15:15,328
pull a few bottles ourselves and have

360
00:15:11,429 --> 00:15:17,819
those analyzed so a lot of times we've

361
00:15:15,328 --> 00:15:20,699
received a complaint maybe a grower used

362
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:22,680
a product something to happen they have

363
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:24,150
their plant material tested and it came

364
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:26,709
up positive for an active ingredient

365
00:15:24,149 --> 00:15:28,449
that they didn't use and they

366
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:29,800
narrow it down and think okay this is

367
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:33,250
the product that it might have come from

368
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:35,500
we can't rely on their test results for

369
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:37,600
enforcement purposes it really needs to

370
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:39,450
be something that we sampled ourselves

371
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,310
we know what the chain of custody is

372
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:45,100
from that point of sale to our lab and

373
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:47,199
then the lab analyzes it if we get

374
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:49,389
results that are positive for an active

375
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:52,120
ingredient not on the label at that

376
00:15:49,389 --> 00:15:55,169
point we would issue a stop sale now

377
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:57,580
aren't you the agency that found

378
00:15:55,169 --> 00:15:59,919
Guardian might spray I know that was a

379
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:01,660
big one that hit the you know I got

380
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:03,309
samples of that back in the day and I

381
00:16:01,659 --> 00:16:05,399
fortunately didn't apply it to my plants

382
00:16:03,309 --> 00:16:09,369
but a lot of growers were using it and

383
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:11,649
so in Oregon and and I think the the

384
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:14,470
Washington rules are quite similar all

385
00:16:11,649 --> 00:16:16,600
cannabis has to be tested for about

386
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:19,899
fifty nine different pesticide active

387
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:22,090
ingredients the Guardian was under our

388
00:16:19,899 --> 00:16:24,279
old testing rules for just medical

389
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:27,070
marijuana but there was a grower who was

390
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:29,379
taking his plant material in and it

391
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:32,290
tested positive for an active ingredient

392
00:16:29,379 --> 00:16:34,450
that he didn't expect and it was

393
00:16:32,289 --> 00:16:37,120
actually the private lab that contacted

394
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:38,650
us because they had a number of

395
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,810
different growers who were saying that

396
00:16:38,649 --> 00:16:42,370
they were testing positive for this none

397
00:16:40,809 --> 00:16:44,199
of them used it and they were starting

398
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:47,409
to point fingers at him as having lab

399
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:49,960
contamination and so he took it upon

400
00:16:47,409 --> 00:16:52,149
himself to kind of sit down with him and

401
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:53,889
figure out what all of them were using

402
00:16:52,149 --> 00:16:58,269
and it turned out Guardian was the

403
00:16:53,889 --> 00:17:00,850
common common thread had it tested came

404
00:16:58,269 --> 00:17:02,370
up positive referred that to us we went

405
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:05,500
out like I said and purchased our own

406
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:08,109
new bottles of that and determined that

407
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:11,680
it did have that that chemical in there

408
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:14,559
and so that's a really positive thing in

409
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:17,799
my mind that the cannabis industry has

410
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:19,659
brought to all of agriculture is we've

411
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:22,180
actually had a handful of those

412
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:26,560
situations since the testing rules went

413
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:29,680
into place and that's really important

414
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:31,509
to not have products adulterated with

415
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:34,269
another active ingredient it's not just

416
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:37,660
cannabis that that affects especially

417
00:17:34,269 --> 00:17:39,339
some of them were Omri lifted so they

418
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:40,509
were ones that people expected were

419
00:17:39,339 --> 00:17:42,699
legal and

420
00:17:40,509 --> 00:17:44,589
appropriate for use on organic crops and

421
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:47,590
the active ingredients that they were

422
00:17:44,589 --> 00:17:50,799
contaminated with are not allowed under

423
00:17:47,589 --> 00:17:52,959
the National Organic Program so it's

424
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,879
really opened up I think all the

425
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:58,660
regulator's eyes and the manufacturers

426
00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:00,130
eyes throughout the country oh I think

427
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:02,110
you bring up a really good point

428
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:04,000
I totally agree with you we need this

429
00:18:02,109 --> 00:18:06,969
level of testing we're putting way too

430
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,440
money too much trust on manufacturers to

431
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:10,839
be delivering what they said they were

432
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:12,549
delivering and it's been proven over and

433
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:14,740
over again I mean Guardian is just one

434
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:17,399
example the other one that pops to mind

435
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:19,569
is my tea wash this this you know

436
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:21,820
alkaline water that was supposedly

437
00:18:19,569 --> 00:18:23,379
killing mites well turned out that there

438
00:18:21,819 --> 00:18:24,759
were other ingredients in there like I

439
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:27,580
believe that was pyrethrin x' in that

440
00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:29,680
case but this level of trust you know

441
00:18:27,579 --> 00:18:31,179
we're assuming that as a grower we're

442
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,660
assuming that the manufacturers telling

443
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:33,460
us the truth

444
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:34,779
and then we're assuming that all these

445
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:38,110
products are being tested by the

446
00:18:34,779 --> 00:18:39,399
government when in reality you know

447
00:18:38,109 --> 00:18:40,689
they're it's sort of something it's a

448
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,160
little bit more of a grayer it's kind of

449
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:45,009
something in between and when you do

450
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:47,980
catch people like this I think that just

451
00:18:45,009 --> 00:18:51,789
shows the need that we have for agencies

452
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:54,910
like yours to exist because it's just so

453
00:18:51,789 --> 00:18:56,589
important I totally agree the the other

454
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:59,380
piece that I always tell folks when I'm

455
00:18:56,589 --> 00:19:02,949
when I'm giving a presentation is and I

456
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:04,900
use Guardian as an example it was four

457
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:09,519
hundred and ten dollars or so I think

458
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:12,240
for a 16 ounce bottle it was what the

459
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:14,889
EPA calls a 25 B product so it had

460
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:17,259
naturally-occurring ingredients I think

461
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:19,000
it was like lemon grass and cinnamon oil

462
00:19:17,259 --> 00:19:20,440
and they listed all the other

463
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,809
ingredients that's kind of the

464
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:24,580
requirement to to fall underneath that

465
00:19:22,809 --> 00:19:28,869
25 B which means they don't have to go

466
00:19:24,579 --> 00:19:30,519
through the full registration process so

467
00:19:28,869 --> 00:19:34,389
we're paying four hundred and ten

468
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:37,930
dollars for Thai food that if you read

469
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:41,020
the reviews on the website works the

470
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:43,660
first time against mites I don't know

471
00:19:41,019 --> 00:19:46,359
about you but my BS meter is off the

472
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:50,580
scale for that and if something sounds

473
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:53,789
too good to be true it probably is

474
00:19:50,579 --> 00:19:56,429
well that's similar to the wash products

475
00:19:53,789 --> 00:20:00,109
the wash products typically have a

476
00:19:56,430 --> 00:20:03,000
pretty pretty steep price on them

477
00:20:00,109 --> 00:20:07,229
they're kept often in the glass case in

478
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:09,210
the front of the shop and most of the

479
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:12,630
product at least disclosed on the label

480
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:13,319
is in active ingredient hmm wonder why

481
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:18,120
it works

482
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:20,039
yeah yeah and for listeners that aren't

483
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:21,569
familiar that's as I understand it and I

484
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:24,389
hope you correct me if I miss state

485
00:20:21,569 --> 00:20:28,889
anything the 25b list is any product

486
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:30,180
that's considered safe for humans things

487
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:32,040
like lavender

488
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:34,140
would be the first example that pops

489
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:37,079
into my mind that may have some known

490
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:39,120
pesticidal properties but then by using

491
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:41,129
those sorts of products in your product

492
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:43,109
you don't have to go through the full

493
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:45,390
EPA registration which is a really

494
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:47,459
challenging long process so if something

495
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:48,810
has that EPA registration they've

496
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:50,400
already gone through all that but a lot

497
00:20:48,809 --> 00:20:52,919
of these products just fall under the 25

498
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,600
B list and my I will tell you some of my

499
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:56,880
entomologist friends we just will not

500
00:20:54,599 --> 00:20:58,349
use products on the 25 B list for the

501
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,940
most part just because they're not as

502
00:20:58,349 --> 00:21:02,129
well tested and they're not as well

503
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:04,380
reviewed in terms of their actual

504
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:07,160
effects on insect populations and things

505
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:10,260
like that yeah you're pretty close

506
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:12,060
there's actually a very set list of

507
00:21:10,259 --> 00:21:16,019
active ingredients that are allowed

508
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:18,990
under the 25 B an exemption from Federal

509
00:21:16,019 --> 00:21:20,160
Register yeah I'm not sure if lavenders

510
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:23,940
on there but things like thyme oil

511
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:26,580
cinnamon oil some zinc I mean it's a

512
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:30,720
pretty limited list they put it together

513
00:21:26,579 --> 00:21:33,000
back in the late 80s they're not ever

514
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:36,509
going to add to it is what they've told

515
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,160
me in the past and so not only do they

516
00:21:36,509 --> 00:21:40,799
have to pull an active ingredient off

517
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:43,590
that list they have to pull the other

518
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:45,329
ingredients or inert off of what they

519
00:21:43,589 --> 00:21:49,589
call the for a list which is minimal

520
00:21:45,329 --> 00:21:50,909
risk and then unlike other pesticide

521
00:21:49,589 --> 00:21:54,059
products they have to tell you

522
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:55,380
everything that's in the ball so most

523
00:21:54,059 --> 00:21:57,029
pesticides you'll see the active

524
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:58,110
ingredient and other ingredients but

525
00:21:57,029 --> 00:21:59,970
they don't ever tell you what those

526
00:21:58,109 --> 00:22:02,459
other ingredients are in order to

527
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:04,140
qualify for 25 B they have to tell you

528
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:05,579
everything that's in there and you're

529
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:07,650
right they don't go through the full EPA

530
00:22:05,579 --> 00:22:10,829
registration they do how

531
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:12,720
have to be registered at least in Oregon

532
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:15,599
I think Washington also registers 25

533
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,950
bees and so our staff review those

534
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:20,490
labels to make sure they're not making

535
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:24,330
wild claims they can't claim to control

536
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:28,980
public health pests which are typically

537
00:22:24,329 --> 00:22:32,009
going to be things bacteria and such in

538
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:34,500
hospitals and mosquito control clay no

539
00:22:32,009 --> 00:22:38,670
vector vector type insects so they can't

540
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:41,819
be for those but yeah and and there's

541
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:43,558
some question in folks minds about how

542
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:45,240
efficacious they are how well do they

543
00:22:43,558 --> 00:22:47,428
work against whatever pests they say

544
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:48,630
they're going to work on yeah that's

545
00:22:47,429 --> 00:22:51,840
really interesting thanks for clarifying

546
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:54,450
that by the way and yes you see a lot of

547
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:56,099
25b products at trade shows for example

548
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:58,769
for the cannabis industry that's where I

549
00:22:56,099 --> 00:23:01,529
see most of them and they all claim

550
00:22:58,769 --> 00:23:03,720
they'll make pretty amazing claims

551
00:23:01,529 --> 00:23:05,759
usually you know verbally to the grower

552
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,750
that's standing there so I would

553
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:08,970
encourage people to do their own

554
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:10,920
research on a lot of these products

555
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:13,319
there's so many of them on the market

556
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:14,910
right now and part of the reason that

557
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:17,539
you're going to see a lot of 25b

558
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:20,940
products are there is no EPA registered

559
00:23:17,539 --> 00:23:23,460
pesticides for anything cannabis it

560
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:25,620
specifically lists that crop I mean

561
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:28,769
there's there's actually listed

562
00:23:25,619 --> 00:23:31,669
pesticides to kill right ditch weed

563
00:23:28,769 --> 00:23:34,500
marijuana but to control a pest

564
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:36,539
specifically listed doesn't exist

565
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:38,299
yeah and so that's one of those those

566
00:23:36,539 --> 00:23:41,159
situations you were asking earlier about

567
00:23:38,299 --> 00:23:44,099
challenges the the federal government

568
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:48,990
hasn't recognized cannabis as a legal

569
00:23:44,099 --> 00:23:50,699
crop therefore research as to what

570
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:53,130
amount of residue you can have on it

571
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:55,650
when you harvest hasn't been done what

572
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:56,730
rate do you apply it that was talking

573
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:59,940
about

574
00:23:56,730 --> 00:24:02,450
phyto toxicity that could be a really

575
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:04,350
big deal with cannabis

576
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:07,740
especially indoor grown where they're

577
00:24:04,349 --> 00:24:09,419
under those those very strong lights you

578
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:12,120
know how long does that active

579
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:14,970
ingredient stay on the plant material we

580
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:16,649
don't know those things that is what is

581
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:20,400
done in order to get a product

582
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:23,250
registered with the EPA and so in Oregon

583
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:26,990
we came up with a list of products that

584
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:30,420
would not be illegal for use on canvas

585
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:32,759
and that means they have really broad

586
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:34,830
label language they're allowed on food

587
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:36,859
crops so some of those 25 B's they just

588
00:24:34,829 --> 00:24:39,089
say you can use it on any food crop and

589
00:24:36,859 --> 00:24:42,389
food crops are really the most

590
00:24:39,089 --> 00:24:46,379
restrictive outside of public health

591
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:47,970
pests for how you use a pesticide the

592
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:49,020
EPA traditionally would set what they

593
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:50,579
call tolerances

594
00:24:49,019 --> 00:24:53,490
that's a residue level that can be on

595
00:24:50,579 --> 00:24:56,909
that crop and they look at potential

596
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:58,200
exposure in the short term and for the

597
00:24:56,910 --> 00:25:00,900
long term

598
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:03,240
what is our potential for chronic

599
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:05,640
long-term health effects if we were to

600
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:07,440
consume that that active ingredient over

601
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:09,000
the course of my lifetime and so they

602
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,429
have models that they put into place

603
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,460
they take into account more sensitive

604
00:25:11,429 --> 00:25:16,860
populations young children the elderly

605
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:18,509
pregnant women and then they come up

606
00:25:16,859 --> 00:25:21,209
with a value that they feel is

607
00:25:18,509 --> 00:25:24,480
protective of human health none of that

608
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:27,630
has been done on the cannabis side have

609
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:31,170
you seen any research on how these

610
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:34,080
pesticides are are affected when

611
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:36,779
combusted and inhaled through the lungs

612
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:38,399
at all versus you know food products

613
00:25:36,779 --> 00:25:40,950
that are obviously you know consumed

614
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:43,019
yeah no that's a great question

615
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:46,519
sometimes I get people saying well why

616
00:25:43,019 --> 00:25:50,099
can't I use what they use on tobacco

617
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:54,170
first of all there's very few pyrolysis

618
00:25:50,099 --> 00:25:56,459
studies ie what happens when you burn it

619
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:58,860
so yeah there's not a lot of information

620
00:25:56,460 --> 00:26:01,049
available we do know something like

621
00:25:58,859 --> 00:26:05,099
michael--ah butanol based on private lab

622
00:26:01,049 --> 00:26:07,200
studies turns into hydrogen cyanide and

623
00:26:05,099 --> 00:26:09,329
that's kind of one that the cannabis

624
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,569
industry needs to be aware of because my

625
00:26:09,329 --> 00:26:14,849
club you know is a fungicide that

626
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:17,639
historically would be used off-label on

627
00:26:14,849 --> 00:26:19,619
cannabis it's fine on your grape leaves

628
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:24,240
that you're not rolling up and smoking

629
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:26,699
hopefully but may not be so great when a

630
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,650
Bic lighter is hot enough to convert

631
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:30,569
whatever my club you know is on there

632
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:32,620
into hydrogen cyanide and you're now

633
00:26:30,569 --> 00:26:36,579
breathing that into your lungs

634
00:26:32,619 --> 00:26:38,589
and one even with tobacco the EPA has

635
00:26:36,579 --> 00:26:40,990
looked at it and said well if there's

636
00:26:38,589 --> 00:26:42,639
pesticide residue on tobacco that's

637
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:45,160
probably the least of your concerns

638
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:47,590
you're inhaling a known carcinogen into

639
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:50,230
your lungs if there's a little bit of

640
00:26:47,589 --> 00:26:52,929
residue pesticide again not your biggest

641
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:55,089
problem at that point so they've kind of

642
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:57,460
taken a hands-off approach even there is

643
00:26:55,089 --> 00:27:00,429
way they absolutely stopped looking at

644
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:03,400
chronic long-term exposure on tobacco

645
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:04,929
they only regulate it for acute exposure

646
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:07,450
for those folks who are applying it

647
00:27:04,929 --> 00:27:08,620
while it's in the ground or working with

648
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:10,720
the plant material when it's harvested

649
00:27:08,619 --> 00:27:13,389
and the other thing I like to throw out

650
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:17,019
I don't give tobacco juice to medically

651
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:19,059
compromised children we are giving

652
00:27:17,019 --> 00:27:21,460
cannabis to medically compromised

653
00:27:19,058 --> 00:27:24,490
children and so we need to be protective

654
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:27,610
of the most vulnerable population that

655
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:29,500
might be using this crop yeah and for

656
00:27:27,609 --> 00:27:32,289
those that don't know the the most

657
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:34,359
common Michael butanol product is Eagle

658
00:27:32,289 --> 00:27:35,589
20 just a consumer name

659
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:37,750
that's the name people are most familiar

660
00:27:35,589 --> 00:27:39,669
with and I have heard the argument that

661
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:41,410
well it's used it's used in vineyards

662
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:43,420
and grapes so why wouldn't it

663
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:45,160
which is an edible crop why couldn't we

664
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:48,100
use it on cannabis and we're using such

665
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:49,808
a small amount that it really isn't

666
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:52,029
gonna have any effect on the final

667
00:27:49,808 --> 00:27:53,470
product and yeah it makes growing a heck

668
00:27:52,029 --> 00:27:54,700
of a lot easier when you don't have to

669
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:59,110
worry about powdery mildew and botrytis

670
00:27:54,700 --> 00:28:00,759
but it's so dangerous and I'm glad that

671
00:27:59,109 --> 00:28:02,439
that information is getting out there

672
00:28:00,759 --> 00:28:04,480
and people are becoming more aware I

673
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:06,960
think that really relates more to the

674
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:09,220
consumer side than the grower side

675
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,049
because there's a lot of trust there on

676
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:13,058
the part of the consumer that these

677
00:28:11,049 --> 00:28:15,389
growers are following all the rules too

678
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:17,678
which is a whole other side of

679
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:19,900
enforcement that we could talk about too

680
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:21,660
that's a challenge well something to

681
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:24,040
consider too is the routes of exposure

682
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:27,808
you may have a you may have a pesticide

683
00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:30,369
material that dermal exposure is very

684
00:28:27,808 --> 00:28:32,079
it's not water soluble it's not going to

685
00:28:30,369 --> 00:28:34,389
get into your skin but if sunny

686
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:36,639
mentioned you combust that you

687
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:40,630
chemically change it and that route

688
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:43,600
through inhalation could be a huge huge

689
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:45,620
impact on your health where again having

690
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:47,929
some on your skin may not be a problem

691
00:28:45,619 --> 00:28:50,509
all and eating it might not be an issue

692
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:52,759
because you have your stomach helps

693
00:28:50,509 --> 00:28:54,470
break down those chemicals before it

694
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:57,558
gets into your bloodstream when you

695
00:28:54,470 --> 00:29:00,470
inhale something your lungs are an

696
00:28:57,558 --> 00:29:05,240
immediate conduit to the bloodstream and

697
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:07,130
so I don't know that we can say it's

698
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:08,808
going to be horrible but the

699
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:12,440
precautionary principle says we haven't

700
00:29:08,808 --> 00:29:17,269
studied that we don't know and the

701
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:21,049
likelihood is that that could be a very

702
00:29:17,269 --> 00:29:25,279
toxic exposure and yeah I think the

703
00:29:21,049 --> 00:29:26,690
customers are you know interested in the

704
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:28,940
cannabis industry because it is

705
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:30,980
regulated and they feel that folks are

706
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:34,850
following those directions and you have

707
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:36,650
a more if there's a sense of confidence

708
00:29:34,849 --> 00:29:41,329
when you walk into a regulated store

709
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:44,480
versus meeting the guy on the corner and

710
00:29:41,329 --> 00:29:46,879
so speaking of pests from from

711
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,920
pesticides how how are you what do you

712
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:52,240
see in terms of lab results in regards

713
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:55,220
to concentrations of these pesticides as

714
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:59,660
cannabis gets concentrated down into

715
00:29:55,220 --> 00:30:01,730
things like wax or rosin or oils are you

716
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:05,509
seeing much higher levels of pesticides

717
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:07,549
in those products well Matt and I don't

718
00:30:05,509 --> 00:30:11,119
see those lab results so I'm not sure I

719
00:30:07,549 --> 00:30:13,519
can speak intelligently to it obviously

720
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:16,639
anytime you concentrate the cannabinoids

721
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:18,529
you're going to concentrate any other

722
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:21,290
chemical that's on there including the

723
00:30:18,529 --> 00:30:26,149
pesticides which is why most states have

724
00:30:21,289 --> 00:30:28,789
a pesticide testing program in place in

725
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:33,320
Oregon the raw plant material is tested

726
00:30:28,789 --> 00:30:37,129
and the bulk oils would be tested for

727
00:30:33,319 --> 00:30:40,609
pesticides it's limited we have 59

728
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:43,010
different active ingredients it's not

729
00:30:40,609 --> 00:30:45,619
CSI it's not like we can just put

730
00:30:43,009 --> 00:30:47,390
something in a little vial and say tell

731
00:30:45,619 --> 00:30:49,789
me everything that's on there you know

732
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:52,300
there's I don't know 1300 or more

733
00:30:49,789 --> 00:30:54,829
different pesticide active ingredients

734
00:30:52,299 --> 00:30:58,859
registered and products in the in the

735
00:30:54,829 --> 00:31:03,449
country so trying to find all of those

736
00:30:58,859 --> 00:31:06,719
they're not easy lab samples to run in

737
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:08,429
addition to that so the state the state

738
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:12,329
kind of had to limit what they were

739
00:31:08,429 --> 00:31:15,960
looking for so in theory if a grower was

740
00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:17,789
using a pesticide that was not one of

741
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:20,360
those 59 you were testing for it could

742
00:31:17,789 --> 00:31:25,619
still be making it through the process

743
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:29,759
that's correct yeah we do like like Matt

744
00:31:25,619 --> 00:31:31,829
was talking about earlier employees who

745
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:35,250
do not have a good working relationship

746
00:31:31,829 --> 00:31:38,909
with their boss or who have left a

747
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:41,099
company many times will call and let us

748
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:43,769
know if there's something potentially

749
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:45,659
hinky going on at a facility so we do

750
00:31:43,769 --> 00:31:49,099
follow up on those kind of complaints as

751
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:51,029
well and not just the the test result

752
00:31:49,099 --> 00:31:52,500
well that's good to hear is that a

753
00:31:51,029 --> 00:31:55,470
confidential process just out of

754
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:58,259
curiosity it can be it depends on how

755
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:59,819
that employee presents themselves if

756
00:31:58,259 --> 00:32:02,039
they want to remain confidential we can

757
00:31:59,819 --> 00:32:03,960
do that they need to let us know and

758
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:06,269
then we will not be able to follow up

759
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:07,620
with them usually we can provide them

760
00:32:06,269 --> 00:32:09,269
with a case number though if they want

761
00:32:07,619 --> 00:32:11,009
to call back and say tell me what

762
00:32:09,269 --> 00:32:12,569
happened with case number such-and-such

763
00:32:11,009 --> 00:32:15,058
then we can provide them with the

764
00:32:12,569 --> 00:32:18,808
information and is that public

765
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:21,509
information if you do have violations on

766
00:32:18,808 --> 00:32:23,639
the cultivation side like that yep all

767
00:32:21,509 --> 00:32:26,339
of that our information is public

768
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:29,190
available so I just have to make a

769
00:32:26,339 --> 00:32:31,439
request in order to receive it okay and

770
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:33,240
since we're talking about pesticides

771
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:36,150
I saw you have an alert right now on

772
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:40,410
your website about pyrethrins and I

773
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:43,950
think you what do you say hi PB oh yeah

774
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:49,400
PP yeah if you prefer nail beet oxide

775
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:51,769
thank you yeah that's a tricky one so

776
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:54,090
pyrethrins are naturally occurring

777
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:57,418
pesticide derived from chrysanthemum

778
00:32:54,089 --> 00:32:58,289
flowers the PBO is what they call a

779
00:32:57,419 --> 00:33:00,929
synergist

780
00:32:58,289 --> 00:33:03,690
it has some pesticidal activity meaning

781
00:33:00,929 --> 00:33:07,679
it kills insects but it's primarily

782
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:09,090
included in there because due to the

783
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:11,280
fact that pyrethrins are naturally

784
00:33:09,089 --> 00:33:13,709
occurring they break down very quickly

785
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:16,829
in the environment

786
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:18,809
and insects can kind of develop some

787
00:33:16,829 --> 00:33:22,769
resistance and so the the PBO is

788
00:33:18,809 --> 00:33:24,779
included in that formulation to help the

789
00:33:22,769 --> 00:33:28,319
pyrethrum be more effective against the

790
00:33:24,779 --> 00:33:30,599
insect it's a nerve agent in insects and

791
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:32,399
the PBO helps keep the insect from

792
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:36,240
metabolizing it so that it actually is

793
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:38,250
effective the in Oregon the Oregon

794
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,690
Health Authority established what

795
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:44,609
pesticides cannabis is going to be

796
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:47,370
tested for they looked at what products

797
00:33:44,609 --> 00:33:49,649
were were folks in the industry likely

798
00:33:47,369 --> 00:33:52,759
to use what products did we know had

799
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:55,650
been historically used like the Eagle 20

800
00:33:52,759 --> 00:33:56,519
and that's how they came up with with

801
00:33:55,650 --> 00:34:00,210
their list

802
00:33:56,519 --> 00:34:05,129
well OTAs list of what products are not

803
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:06,870
illegal to use are ones that have either

804
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:08,760
no tolerance some of them like

805
00:34:06,869 --> 00:34:11,398
pyrethrins EPA has said it's low enough

806
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:13,710
in toxicity you can use it up to the day

807
00:34:11,398 --> 00:34:16,079
of harvest and we're not going to be

808
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:19,110
concerned about residue levels on the

809
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:22,529
crops that it's used on so it got onto

810
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:24,059
our list because it met our criteria so

811
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:26,490
the products that that have that in

812
00:34:24,059 --> 00:34:28,230
there that have label language that is

813
00:34:26,489 --> 00:34:31,459
broad enough that we can allow it for

814
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:34,050
use on cannabis are allowed on our list

815
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:37,519
this is one of those situations where

816
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:40,320
not having Extension Service or

817
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:43,349
companies doing research we don't know

818
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:45,840
what happens on cannabis when you apply

819
00:34:43,349 --> 00:34:47,909
pyrethrins we know what happens on

820
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:49,710
squash and cabbage and all of those

821
00:34:47,909 --> 00:34:53,809
things and we know it breaks down very

822
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:57,659
quickly cannabis is a cool unique plant

823
00:34:53,809 --> 00:35:00,179
it's possible that it doesn't happen the

824
00:34:57,659 --> 00:35:03,079
same way and so some growers have sailed

825
00:35:00,179 --> 00:35:05,460
for pyrethrins and or PPO

826
00:35:03,079 --> 00:35:08,159
who use the product according to the

827
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:11,579
label directions and we don't know why

828
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:14,429
that is so that's why we have the allure

829
00:35:11,579 --> 00:35:17,039
out there use it your own caution there

830
00:35:14,429 --> 00:35:19,829
are some remediation options available

831
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:23,550
just for pyrethrins and PPO that are not

832
00:35:19,829 --> 00:35:25,259
available for other active ingredients

833
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:25,710
if they can show that they used a

834
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:27,420
product

835
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:30,150
the guide lists and according to the

836
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:32,450
label direction but it's it's kind of

837
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:35,309
kind of a gray area and until we get

838
00:35:32,449 --> 00:35:37,469
research into the plant you know good

839
00:35:35,309 --> 00:35:40,259
agronomic research we're not going to

840
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:42,209
know why that's happening great and all

841
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:43,830
of this information is available on your

842
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:45,480
website I'm actually looking at it right

843
00:35:43,829 --> 00:35:46,799
now there's a there's a PDF you can

844
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:49,108
download on the differences between

845
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,570
pyrethrins and pyrethroids you have the

846
00:35:49,108 --> 00:35:53,489
alert on there I would encourage all

847
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:55,710
listeners to go and sign up for the

848
00:35:53,489 --> 00:35:59,159
email alerts you get all the stop sale

849
00:35:55,710 --> 00:36:01,050
information whenever new analysis come

850
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:02,879
out I really appreciate the work that

851
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:06,359
the AODA is doing around sharing this

852
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,950
information with growers so I wanted to

853
00:36:06,358 --> 00:36:09,779
I wanted to change direction though a

854
00:36:07,949 --> 00:36:12,719
little bit and ask a question for Matt

855
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:16,080
regarding the microbial analysis that

856
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:19,949
has been done by the oda as well I'm

857
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:21,150
looking at tests from 2015 and I can

858
00:36:19,949 --> 00:36:24,269
tell you that these tests have been

859
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:26,338
highly debated in forums online based on

860
00:36:24,269 --> 00:36:27,960
the results you're getting is there

861
00:36:26,338 --> 00:36:32,969
anything you can explain a little bit

862
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:37,230
about that program well is bacteria and

863
00:36:32,969 --> 00:36:38,639
fungi have been guaranteed in for lack

864
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:40,639
of a better way of saying it fertilizer

865
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:44,129
products for a number of years now and

866
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:48,809
unlike the chemical constituents

867
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:51,630
nitrogen boron zinc etc no state had

868
00:36:48,809 --> 00:36:54,150
been actively looking at these

869
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:56,039
components during marketplace sampling

870
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:57,690
so while it's common for a product to be

871
00:36:56,039 --> 00:36:59,489
tested you know somebody finds in the

872
00:36:57,690 --> 00:37:01,920
marketplace I find in the marketplace I

873
00:36:59,489 --> 00:37:03,929
bring it back send it to a regulatory

874
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:06,289
lab we want to see if it's got all of

875
00:37:03,929 --> 00:37:09,029
the available phosphates it's guaranteed

876
00:37:06,289 --> 00:37:13,550
again boron zinc copper whatever it is

877
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:20,269
but no state had been looking at

878
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:23,010
microbial components so back around 2013

879
00:37:20,269 --> 00:37:24,869
Oregon right now we're the only state

880
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:26,160
that is looking at these components we

881
00:37:24,869 --> 00:37:30,710
started to do some very rudimentary

882
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:34,710
testing using simple very simple

883
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:39,119
dilution plating to look at bacillus

884
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:41,460
trichoderma Pseudomonas can we find the

885
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:42,989
is bacterial and simple fungi and the

886
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:46,820
product at the levels that they're

887
00:37:42,989 --> 00:37:51,809
guaranteed and overwhelmingly we're not

888
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:56,519
we also retained a well-known mycologist

889
00:37:51,809 --> 00:37:59,009
in Corvallis Oregon to look at vesicular

890
00:37:56,519 --> 00:38:00,829
our bus killer mycorrhizal fungi such as

891
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:06,360
Glomus or giga spora

892
00:38:00,829 --> 00:38:08,969
he's looking at are the spores there are

893
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:11,220
the root fragments there does it meet

894
00:38:08,969 --> 00:38:13,739
its guarantee of spores or propagules

895
00:38:11,219 --> 00:38:15,929
doing a little better there but for the

896
00:38:13,739 --> 00:38:19,289
most part products are not meeting their

897
00:38:15,929 --> 00:38:24,690
guarantees for the microcell fungi

898
00:38:19,289 --> 00:38:26,699
either so i think a lot of it is for

899
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:29,309
years and years folks have been able to

900
00:38:26,699 --> 00:38:31,980
make guarantees unchecked we're calling

901
00:38:29,309 --> 00:38:33,509
them on it now and i think it's it's

902
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:35,730
it's going to shake up the way the

903
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:39,000
industry promotes and guaranties

904
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:40,949
products have you found that bacteria or

905
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:44,460
fungi that are of human health concerns

906
00:38:40,949 --> 00:38:48,119
as well well right now we're looking at

907
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:50,670
such a high level for example oregon

908
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:52,739
oregon law requires identification by

909
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:56,610
genus and species and strain if if

910
00:38:52,739 --> 00:38:59,849
relevant but right now we're looking at

911
00:38:56,610 --> 00:39:03,420
just the species level so for example if

912
00:38:59,849 --> 00:39:07,650
they guaranteed ten combos of bacillus

913
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:10,260
so bacillus subtilis bacillus cereus etc

914
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:13,920
etc all the way down all we're doing

915
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:18,120
right now is looking at how many

916
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:21,360
bacillus are in that sample and they're

917
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:24,750
failing again almost universally we have

918
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:29,010
the ability to look at at the species

919
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:32,519
but if you can't crawl yet there's no

920
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:33,750
reason to see if you can run if it gets

921
00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:35,460
to a point where products meet their

922
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:38,510
guarantees we can go to the species

923
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:41,340
level and see if they have harmful

924
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:43,770
potentially human pathogens in there but

925
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:46,620
right now we're we're not they're not

926
00:39:43,769 --> 00:39:48,150
even close to be in there that's a

927
00:39:46,619 --> 00:39:50,250
really interesting question sunny we

928
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:52,470
just assume that these products are safe

929
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:52,949
because they're being packaged and sold

930
00:39:52,469 --> 00:39:55,679
by a

931
00:39:52,949 --> 00:39:57,469
a commercial company it didn't even

932
00:39:55,679 --> 00:40:01,289
really occur to me that something might

933
00:39:57,469 --> 00:40:03,059
have human health impact really my my

934
00:40:01,289 --> 00:40:04,289
initial thought was just I was amazed

935
00:40:03,059 --> 00:40:07,320
that these products weren't being

936
00:40:04,289 --> 00:40:08,849
detected you know are these microbes

937
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:11,970
were being detected on the products I'm

938
00:40:08,849 --> 00:40:13,889
looking at the label right now from 2015

939
00:40:11,969 --> 00:40:15,509
for piranhas with advanced nutrients and

940
00:40:13,889 --> 00:40:17,579
they claim to have you know micro aisel

941
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:20,640
fungus Pseudomonas and Trichoderma you

942
00:40:17,579 --> 00:40:22,319
know 55 million CFU a Trichoderma and

943
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:24,989
you didn't detect any of those things in

944
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:26,850
the product at all and people are paying

945
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:28,379
through the roof for these products it's

946
00:40:26,849 --> 00:40:30,000
amazing how expensive they are I know

947
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:33,030
you touched on that or with on the

948
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,639
pesticides things so I'm hoping we're

949
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:38,970
going to get more accountability of of

950
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:41,730
these manufacturers on the products that

951
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:43,849
they're providing to the industry so we

952
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:46,590
do need more of this microbial testing

953
00:40:43,849 --> 00:40:50,069
and where we don't where we're not

954
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:52,769
entirely clear right now is again let's

955
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:54,990
let's make the assumption of a benefit

956
00:40:52,769 --> 00:40:57,030
and I'm not positive that there is one

957
00:40:54,989 --> 00:41:00,869
yet right now again we're looking at

958
00:40:57,030 --> 00:41:02,280
content not necessarily benefit but I'm

959
00:41:00,869 --> 00:41:05,940
not sure that we're going in the right

960
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:11,900
direction in terms of guaranteeing for

961
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:14,639
example trikha derma at a 55 million

962
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:17,369
colony forming units per per milliliter

963
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:21,569
is that the right thing to do you know

964
00:41:17,369 --> 00:41:23,730
we enforce law that is written by the

965
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:26,100
legislature sometimes with assistance

966
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:28,670
from the the department but it's drafted

967
00:41:26,099 --> 00:41:31,079
by the legislature that law says that

968
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:34,170
these products have to guarantee genus

969
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:39,619
and species but there's more and more

970
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:43,409
evidence that points to it's not

971
00:41:39,619 --> 00:41:47,789
specifically trikha derma horsy annum

972
00:41:43,409 --> 00:41:51,239
live fungi that you really want to buy

973
00:41:47,789 --> 00:41:54,420
it's the stuff that trikha derma hardy

974
00:41:51,239 --> 00:41:57,899
Anam secretes as it's growing and living

975
00:41:54,420 --> 00:42:03,210
and dying that you want to buy what is

976
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:04,950
that stuff no clue no clue whatsoever if

977
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:06,769
that's the case then we're barking up

978
00:42:04,949 --> 00:42:09,079
the wrong tree by saying

979
00:42:06,769 --> 00:42:13,070
okay you have to have a genus and

980
00:42:09,079 --> 00:42:16,309
species guarantee but on the other hand

981
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:20,450
if the magic stuff that these bacteria

982
00:42:16,309 --> 00:42:22,009
and fungi secrete is unknown then how do

983
00:42:20,449 --> 00:42:25,250
you make a level and fair playing field

984
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:27,980
amongst products so it's it's a struggle

985
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:29,869
right now yeah that's a good point I

986
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:32,119
think the challenge I see is as a grower

987
00:42:29,869 --> 00:42:32,840
or someone who's be purchasing these

988
00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:35,539
products

989
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:37,550
I need something quantifiable that I can

990
00:42:35,539 --> 00:42:40,159
compare so when I'm looking at two

991
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:43,130
products and one you know offers me the

992
00:42:40,159 --> 00:42:45,409
gloma Center a disease or rise of Vegas

993
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:47,720
and Terada sees it say 50 spores per

994
00:42:45,409 --> 00:42:49,099
gram and another one guarantees 500

995
00:42:47,719 --> 00:42:52,099
spores per gram and they're the same

996
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:53,349
price my initial thought is to go with

997
00:42:52,099 --> 00:42:55,699
the one where I'm getting more

998
00:42:53,349 --> 00:42:59,000
essentially what seems like more product

999
00:42:55,699 --> 00:43:01,939
for my money but what you're finding is

1000
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:04,159
that maybe these claims on the labels

1001
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:06,230
are really not all that accurate to

1002
00:43:04,159 --> 00:43:07,609
where what you're getting is nowhere

1003
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:10,699
near what you thought you were paying

1004
00:43:07,610 --> 00:43:12,858
for I think that's the challenge yeah

1005
00:43:10,699 --> 00:43:14,960
it's a little different though so you're

1006
00:43:12,858 --> 00:43:17,358
talking what you mentioned we're my

1007
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:20,030
kreizel fungi and the processes there

1008
00:43:17,358 --> 00:43:22,670
are much more well known in that you

1009
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:25,490
need to so if it's AG Lamas or Giga

1010
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:28,970
spore or whatever happens to be the idea

1011
00:43:25,489 --> 00:43:32,539
there is you want that fun fungi to

1012
00:43:28,969 --> 00:43:35,389
infect a root so you need that spore or

1013
00:43:32,539 --> 00:43:37,849
that propagule whether it's an infected

1014
00:43:35,389 --> 00:43:41,659
root fragment that you add but you need

1015
00:43:37,849 --> 00:43:44,389
specific infection it infects you get

1016
00:43:41,659 --> 00:43:46,608
that awesome Mike Mike rival Association

1017
00:43:44,389 --> 00:43:49,039
the soil of expand your root zone etc

1018
00:43:46,608 --> 00:43:50,710
etc those products are a little more

1019
00:43:49,039 --> 00:43:54,079
easy to quantify because we're counting

1020
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:56,059
spores were counting root fragments

1021
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:59,809
whatever to make propagules we

1022
00:43:56,059 --> 00:44:03,349
understand the process with the bacteria

1023
00:43:59,809 --> 00:44:06,500
such as bacillus or Pseudomonas or what

1024
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:11,920
we refer to as simple fungi like trikha

1025
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:15,429
derma they're they they all can excrete

1026
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:19,159
VOCs volatile organic compounds of

1027
00:44:15,429 --> 00:44:20,719
whatever nature they are this is much

1028
00:44:19,159 --> 00:44:22,639
less clear

1029
00:44:20,719 --> 00:44:24,529
there's lots of ways they can promote

1030
00:44:22,639 --> 00:44:28,690
plant growth some of them are pesticidal

1031
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:32,540
they actually act on other passage

1032
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:34,608
pathogens in the soil they can excrete

1033
00:44:32,539 --> 00:44:37,969
compounds that can soluble eyes let's

1034
00:44:34,608 --> 00:44:40,549
say iron or phosphate they could excrete

1035
00:44:37,969 --> 00:44:44,358
compounds that could actually get into

1036
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:46,640
the plant and signal in different

1037
00:44:44,358 --> 00:44:48,679
pathways metabolic pathways in the plant

1038
00:44:46,639 --> 00:44:52,969
we just don't have a good understanding

1039
00:44:48,679 --> 00:44:54,379
of these compounds they secrete and then

1040
00:44:52,969 --> 00:44:57,139
if you don't understand the compounds

1041
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:59,750
how do you quantify them so sense what

1042
00:44:57,139 --> 00:45:02,838
you're saying is maybe the cure the Cure

1043
00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:04,550
current way that we are regulating these

1044
00:45:02,838 --> 00:45:08,480
products because we don't know the

1045
00:45:04,550 --> 00:45:11,119
effects of these microbes or or how they

1046
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:12,588
act on plants that really for certain

1047
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:17,180
species it may not be the most accurate

1048
00:45:12,588 --> 00:45:18,139
way of labeling or quantifying them and

1049
00:45:17,179 --> 00:45:21,799
that's yeah that's correct

1050
00:45:18,139 --> 00:45:23,150
we're we we enforce statute we enforce

1051
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:24,859
Oregon law and that's the way it's

1052
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:26,990
written right now it may not be the best

1053
00:45:24,858 --> 00:45:29,960
way or it may be the best way we just

1054
00:45:26,989 --> 00:45:32,299
don't know again we're starting if this

1055
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:34,309
quantification stage somebody says

1056
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:37,010
there's bacillus subtilis we want to see

1057
00:45:34,309 --> 00:45:39,108
if there's bacillus in this product we

1058
00:45:37,010 --> 00:45:41,450
still don't know Tad's are these

1059
00:45:39,108 --> 00:45:42,619
products truly effective or is it a

1060
00:45:41,449 --> 00:45:44,750
placebo effect

1061
00:45:42,619 --> 00:45:45,680
hey this is two hundred and fifty

1062
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:49,608
dollars a litre

1063
00:45:45,679 --> 00:45:52,848
it's got 55 different genus and species

1064
00:45:49,608 --> 00:45:54,858
this stuff's awesome I don't know I

1065
00:45:52,849 --> 00:45:55,609
don't know how much good work has been

1066
00:45:54,858 --> 00:45:57,949
done out there

1067
00:45:55,608 --> 00:46:02,779
I don't know that any has really been

1068
00:45:57,949 --> 00:46:05,480
done with off-the-shelf product to to

1069
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:07,849
look at to evaluate the content first

1070
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:09,920
didn't meet its guarantees and then

1071
00:46:07,849 --> 00:46:13,039
let's let's use it per the label

1072
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:15,710
directions are we seeing an agronomic

1073
00:46:13,039 --> 00:46:18,800
benefit to this did we get a better crop

1074
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:22,309
yield did we get some other quantifiable

1075
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:24,829
effect or again is it just placebo hey

1076
00:46:22,309 --> 00:46:27,769
the grow magazine say this is what you

1077
00:46:24,829 --> 00:46:30,609
use for whatever whatever results you're

1078
00:46:27,769 --> 00:46:33,559
looking for the science the hard

1079
00:46:30,608 --> 00:46:35,969
peer-reviewed science just isn't there

1080
00:46:33,559 --> 00:46:38,039
yeah I think another point that you

1081
00:46:35,969 --> 00:46:39,568
bring up that's that's good dimension is

1082
00:46:38,039 --> 00:46:41,190
that just because a product it makes

1083
00:46:39,568 --> 00:46:43,739
your list of something that's approved

1084
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:46,500
for use is not in any way condoning it

1085
00:46:43,739 --> 00:46:48,389
in terms of efficacy or the ODA saying

1086
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:50,639
you should use this product in your in

1087
00:46:48,389 --> 00:46:54,900
your cultivation practices it's just

1088
00:46:50,639 --> 00:46:56,759
that it according to the way the the its

1089
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:59,760
structured from from a legal perspective

1090
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:02,099
you're allowed to use it correct yes

1091
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:03,990
that's true on pesticides fertilizers we

1092
00:47:02,099 --> 00:47:06,778
do not have a list for fertilizers just

1093
00:47:03,989 --> 00:47:09,149
to be clear we have our registered

1094
00:47:06,778 --> 00:47:10,710
product list right and we say that they

1095
00:47:09,150 --> 00:47:13,440
these products have met the requirements

1096
00:47:10,710 --> 00:47:17,010
in Oregon law but again you're right

1097
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:19,079
it's not it's not a endorsement that hey

1098
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:21,690
this will work or give you some benefit

1099
00:47:19,079 --> 00:47:24,359
at that point yeah so what's to keep a

1100
00:47:21,690 --> 00:47:26,670
company then from putting out a product

1101
00:47:24,358 --> 00:47:28,949
and just not listing any microbes I'm

1102
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:30,289
putting out a micro product and just

1103
00:47:28,949 --> 00:47:33,028
saying there's microbes in there without

1104
00:47:30,289 --> 00:47:37,140
listing or making any claims in terms of

1105
00:47:33,028 --> 00:47:39,568
the guarantees well they can if they're

1106
00:47:37,139 --> 00:47:40,739
gonna claim microbial content in any way

1107
00:47:39,568 --> 00:47:44,038
shape or form whether it's on the

1108
00:47:40,739 --> 00:47:47,250
physical product label or the you know

1109
00:47:44,039 --> 00:47:50,819
web presence or brochures or fliers they

1110
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:52,199
can't unless they make a guarantee now

1111
00:47:50,818 --> 00:47:53,909
it doesn't stop them from putting on

1112
00:47:52,199 --> 00:47:55,769
microbial component in there and saying

1113
00:47:53,909 --> 00:47:57,838
nothing about it because we won't know

1114
00:47:55,769 --> 00:48:00,599
but if they're gonna say microbes and

1115
00:47:57,838 --> 00:48:02,659
they have to guarantee microbes okay

1116
00:48:00,599 --> 00:48:05,579
that's interesting that's good to know

1117
00:48:02,659 --> 00:48:08,578
so I feel like we've done a good job of

1118
00:48:05,579 --> 00:48:10,289
talking about the test results I wasn't

1119
00:48:08,579 --> 00:48:12,930
wondering are you guys going to be

1120
00:48:10,289 --> 00:48:14,190
coming out with any new lab tests like

1121
00:48:12,929 --> 00:48:17,058
this I know it's been a little while

1122
00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:19,200
since the last sort of series of these

1123
00:48:17,059 --> 00:48:21,990
is there any more in the works that we

1124
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:23,879
can look forward to yeah yeah we have

1125
00:48:21,989 --> 00:48:27,149
them in the works continually every year

1126
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:31,410
we take samples but our processes to

1127
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:34,318
make sure that all enforcement actions

1128
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:37,769
are completely wrapped up because any

1129
00:48:34,318 --> 00:48:40,440
enforcement we take the recipient has

1130
00:48:37,769 --> 00:48:42,088
legal rights and they can challenge the

1131
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:44,579
results we get so we have to make sure

1132
00:48:42,088 --> 00:48:45,880
it's they've exhausted all of the rights

1133
00:48:44,579 --> 00:48:49,810
that they wish to ex

1134
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:51,880
sighs before before we post anything but

1135
00:48:49,809 --> 00:48:55,630
yeah we can we test every year and we

1136
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:58,059
have we have reports for 17 calendar

1137
00:48:55,630 --> 00:48:59,170
year and 18 calendar year that are that

1138
00:48:58,059 --> 00:49:01,929
are written up just waiting for

1139
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:03,430
enforcement to wrap up I can't wait to

1140
00:49:01,929 --> 00:49:06,159
see that and I would encourage listeners

1141
00:49:03,429 --> 00:49:08,789
to go on the website if they haven't

1142
00:49:06,159 --> 00:49:10,659
seen these results it's freely available

1143
00:49:08,789 --> 00:49:12,340
there's no reason you shouldn't go there

1144
00:49:10,659 --> 00:49:14,799
and see if the products are using are

1145
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:16,269
have been tested and see what results

1146
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:18,400
you know the Oregon Department of

1147
00:49:16,269 --> 00:49:19,809
Agriculture got when they tested the

1148
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:21,220
products you're using I mean it's it's

1149
00:49:19,809 --> 00:49:24,369
free information out there and I think

1150
00:49:21,219 --> 00:49:25,659
people need to access it I will tell you

1151
00:49:24,369 --> 00:49:29,319
it's gonna be more of the same though

1152
00:49:25,659 --> 00:49:31,809
same him different verse okay so like

1153
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:33,640
different companies same same accounts

1154
00:49:31,809 --> 00:49:36,009
yeah results are not getting better

1155
00:49:33,639 --> 00:49:36,489
let's put it that way okay well that's

1156
00:49:36,010 --> 00:49:39,490
good to know

1157
00:49:36,489 --> 00:49:41,319
that's good to know is there is there

1158
00:49:39,489 --> 00:49:44,859
anything else that you guys wanted to

1159
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:47,260
talk about or share with wid listeners

1160
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:48,670
you know Sonny on the policy side or

1161
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:53,020
Matt on the fertiliser side that we

1162
00:49:48,670 --> 00:49:54,940
didn't talk about yet it's just looking

1163
00:49:53,019 --> 00:49:57,670
at cannabis in general it's still

1164
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:59,860
evolving and I know in Oregon and I

1165
00:49:57,670 --> 00:50:02,430
think it's true in other states every

1166
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:05,349
time our legislature is in champ in town

1167
00:50:02,429 --> 00:50:10,089
something changes and then the agency

1168
00:50:05,349 --> 00:50:12,279
has to go into rulemaking so so taking a

1169
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:16,030
step back the legislature passes a bill

1170
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:18,010
that becomes the law how is the agency

1171
00:50:16,030 --> 00:50:18,550
going to implement the law that's the

1172
00:50:18,010 --> 00:50:22,180
rules

1173
00:50:18,550 --> 00:50:24,070
that we put forth that goes through a

1174
00:50:22,179 --> 00:50:26,009
public comment period it's a public

1175
00:50:24,070 --> 00:50:28,690
involved process and then ultimately

1176
00:50:26,010 --> 00:50:31,990
that's what Matt's program is enforcing

1177
00:50:28,690 --> 00:50:35,289
off of is the rules and you know it's

1178
00:50:31,989 --> 00:50:37,659
been a wild ride with cannabis and it's

1179
00:50:35,289 --> 00:50:39,789
going to continue to be a wild ride and

1180
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:43,059
our legislature will be starting here on

1181
00:50:39,789 --> 00:50:45,279
the 22nd of January and that this is a

1182
00:50:43,059 --> 00:50:47,799
nod here so it's a full session so that

1183
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:49,900
means hang on to your your hats and

1184
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:53,500
we're going to be working at the

1185
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:55,570
legislature until June so the goal is

1186
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:57,250
always consumer safety and consumer

1187
00:50:55,570 --> 00:50:58,980
protections you're always working

1188
00:50:57,250 --> 00:51:02,150
towards that goal and it's sort

1189
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:06,150
of evolving as it goes it sounds like

1190
00:51:02,150 --> 00:51:07,920
from what you're describing yeah one

1191
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:09,960
specific related with cannabis you know

1192
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:12,780
there's all kinds of other other moving

1193
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:14,369
pieces with the other agencies and you

1194
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:17,220
know law enforcement concerns and

1195
00:51:14,369 --> 00:51:19,590
federal concerns and and that affects

1196
00:51:17,219 --> 00:51:21,539
the industry and it affects you know it

1197
00:51:19,590 --> 00:51:24,450
feels confusing and it feels like things

1198
00:51:21,539 --> 00:51:28,108
are changing all the time the agencies

1199
00:51:24,449 --> 00:51:30,719
are feeling that pain as well it's it's

1200
00:51:28,108 --> 00:51:32,460
not easy and I think it's going to be an

1201
00:51:30,719 --> 00:51:34,349
involving process for a number of years

1202
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:37,800
as we start something that's brand-new I

1203
00:51:34,349 --> 00:51:39,299
think that's also why I call it you know

1204
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:41,670
opportunities rather than just

1205
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:44,640
challenges is when do you get to be part

1206
00:51:41,670 --> 00:51:45,960
of a brand new industry like this yeah

1207
00:51:44,639 --> 00:51:47,969
that's a good point it is is this

1208
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:50,220
exciting to be involved in something

1209
00:51:47,969 --> 00:51:52,289
that is an emerging market and an

1210
00:51:50,219 --> 00:51:55,379
emerging industry and we're all we're

1211
00:51:52,289 --> 00:51:57,960
learning so much every year that about

1212
00:51:55,380 --> 00:52:00,829
this plant and optimal ways to cultivate

1213
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:03,570
it so I do appreciate that perspective

1214
00:52:00,829 --> 00:52:05,099
I'll throw in a couple of comments here

1215
00:52:03,570 --> 00:52:08,100
too you know Sonny's talking about

1216
00:52:05,099 --> 00:52:10,829
emerging industry but yet on on my side

1217
00:52:08,099 --> 00:52:13,710
of the aisle the fertilizer side we're

1218
00:52:10,829 --> 00:52:16,139
seeing a definite contraction in the

1219
00:52:13,710 --> 00:52:19,429
number of grow shops that are open lots

1220
00:52:16,139 --> 00:52:22,500
have closed we're seeing suppliers

1221
00:52:19,429 --> 00:52:25,049
smaller suppliers of products that are

1222
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:28,260
no longer renewing their registrations

1223
00:52:25,050 --> 00:52:30,060
or are out of business completely the

1224
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:34,740
industry took a big at least on my end

1225
00:52:30,059 --> 00:52:36,799
of things took a big hit in 2018 do you

1226
00:52:34,739 --> 00:52:40,919
think that was just due to the over

1227
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:43,320
oversupply of cannabis to the

1228
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:46,590
recreational market by growers and then

1229
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:49,680
also the the movement towards online

1230
00:52:46,590 --> 00:52:52,260
sales for hydro shops and and going

1231
00:52:49,679 --> 00:52:56,759
straight to the manufacturer I think

1232
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:58,859
it's a little of both I think if why why

1233
00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:00,420
would I grow a head of lettuce at home

1234
00:52:58,858 --> 00:53:02,750
go through all the effort of growing a

1235
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:06,090
head of lettuce at home when I can go to

1236
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:08,159
five different stores within a mile

1237
00:53:06,090 --> 00:53:09,360
radius in my house and buy it cheaper

1238
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:10,739
than I can

1239
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:13,620
can grow up myself you're always going

1240
00:53:10,739 --> 00:53:17,339
to have folks that home garden and want

1241
00:53:13,619 --> 00:53:19,739
to to do it themselves but I think

1242
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:22,320
there's just a lot of folks that are not

1243
00:53:19,739 --> 00:53:23,939
buying those input products because

1244
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:26,250
they've either reduced their operation

1245
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:30,179
size or like you said there was a big

1246
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:32,389
oversupply of product in 2018 so the

1247
00:53:30,179 --> 00:53:36,329
markets change we had one of our our

1248
00:53:32,389 --> 00:53:38,309
registrants here in Oregon when I was at

1249
00:53:36,329 --> 00:53:40,349
an inspection a couple years ago who did

1250
00:53:38,309 --> 00:53:41,880
not want to see legalization happen

1251
00:53:40,349 --> 00:53:44,730
because he felt it would impact his

1252
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:47,400
business and sure enough it's impacting

1253
00:53:44,730 --> 00:53:49,500
his business yeah I I agree with that

1254
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:51,240
but I hope maybe people listening this

1255
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:53,159
podcast today will realize some of the

1256
00:53:51,239 --> 00:53:56,069
importance behind possibly growing their

1257
00:53:53,159 --> 00:53:57,599
own in the sense that they can't

1258
00:53:56,070 --> 00:53:59,789
necessarily trust everything that's on

1259
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:02,670
the market as it stands right now from

1260
00:53:59,789 --> 00:54:05,820
what we're learning but I do appreciate

1261
00:54:02,670 --> 00:54:08,070
you guys working towards keeping keeping

1262
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:11,370
products safe and and really trying to

1263
00:54:08,070 --> 00:54:13,410
push you know manufacturers to provide

1264
00:54:11,369 --> 00:54:16,049
safe product and accurate product and

1265
00:54:13,409 --> 00:54:18,719
then cultivators to do the same with

1266
00:54:16,050 --> 00:54:20,370
with the actual cannabis itself so thank

1267
00:54:18,719 --> 00:54:22,259
you for that yeah it's never it'll never

1268
00:54:20,369 --> 00:54:24,239
go away I mean I grow tomatoes at home

1269
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:27,000
because I find the tomatoes in the

1270
00:54:24,239 --> 00:54:28,409
grocery store disgusting so you're

1271
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,820
always going to have folks I agree with

1272
00:54:28,409 --> 00:54:31,859
you that you're always going to want to

1273
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:33,840
do it themselves too either because they

1274
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:35,940
like to grow things or they want to grow

1275
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:38,880
a variety that they can't find or they

1276
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:41,369
want to fiddle around in many many ways

1277
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:44,180
that they can control but yeah I don't

1278
00:54:41,369 --> 00:54:47,309
think we're going to go back to the mid

1279
00:54:44,179 --> 00:54:50,609
2000s where the crop was totally legal

1280
00:54:47,309 --> 00:54:52,730
and if you wanted a reliable known

1281
00:54:50,610 --> 00:54:55,470
source you were gonna do it yourself

1282
00:54:52,730 --> 00:54:57,059
yeah well I just want to say thank you

1283
00:54:55,469 --> 00:54:58,289
for your time today I really appreciate

1284
00:54:57,059 --> 00:55:00,059
you guys your willingness is a

1285
00:54:58,289 --> 00:55:01,860
government agency to come on the podcast

1286
00:55:00,059 --> 00:55:04,440
and share this information with with

1287
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:06,180
cultivators and take time out of your

1288
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:09,450
day was there anything else you wanted

1289
00:55:06,179 --> 00:55:11,159
to add before we sign off I would just

1290
00:55:09,449 --> 00:55:12,539
add like you said have folks go look at

1291
00:55:11,159 --> 00:55:14,699
the website

1292
00:55:12,539 --> 00:55:16,860
Matan eyes contact information is there

1293
00:55:14,699 --> 00:55:18,960
or you're welcome to provide our contact

1294
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:21,150
information on your website so if folks

1295
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:22,039
have follow-up questions send them our

1296
00:55:21,150 --> 00:55:24,110
way yeah we're

1297
00:55:22,039 --> 00:55:26,840
happy to chat with people that's that's

1298
00:55:24,110 --> 00:55:29,269
the best way for people to to know what

1299
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:31,250
is happening and get the the true

1300
00:55:29,269 --> 00:55:34,039
information because I find there's a lot

1301
00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:36,679
of rumors that go around in these

1302
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:38,929
industries a universal for at least my

1303
00:55:36,679 --> 00:55:41,179
program is the more folks talk to us the

1304
00:55:38,929 --> 00:55:42,769
less problems they have so you would

1305
00:55:41,179 --> 00:55:44,960
rather have someone reach out to you at

1306
00:55:42,769 --> 00:55:47,480
the beginning before applying a product

1307
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:49,039
before getting to a situation than where

1308
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:53,300
