00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:21,150
welcome to the cannabis cultivation and

3
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:23,640
science podcast

4
00:00:21,149 --> 00:00:26,129
I'm your host tad hussy of KISS organics

5
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,899
this is the podcast where we discuss the

6
00:00:26,129 --> 00:00:30,059
cutting edge of organic growing from a

7
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:31,829
science-based perspective and drawn top

8
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:33,780
experts from around the industry to

9
00:00:31,829 --> 00:00:35,100
share their wisdom and knowledge it's

10
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,259
been a little while since the last

11
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,939
podcast I wanted to let you know that

12
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:40,619
I've been busy with some other projects

13
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:42,599
but also tracking down some new and

14
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:44,399
exciting guests I have some really great

15
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,890
podcasts lined up in the coming month

16
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,808
including one with Alison Justus of Elko

17
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,670
to help dispel some of the myths they've

18
00:00:48,808 --> 00:00:53,939
been floating around the cannabis

19
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:55,469
cultivation industry for decades and I

20
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:57,599
know we've already done some podcast

21
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:59,219
discussing mycorrhizal fungi including

22
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,469
one with jeff Lowen fellows that I

23
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:03,179
suggest you check out I wanted to do

24
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:05,368
this interview though to get a different

25
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:06,688
perspective on mycorrhizal fungi from

26
00:01:05,368 --> 00:01:08,219
someone who has been involved in the

27
00:01:06,688 --> 00:01:10,618
industry and selling and using it for

28
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:12,359
over a decade I've had my opinions based

29
00:01:10,618 --> 00:01:14,219
on the research I've seen regarding

30
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:16,409
topics like using a single species

31
00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:18,179
versus diverse species of Enda

32
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:20,180
mycorrhizal fungi as well as the

33
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:24,000
addition of Trichoderma to these mixes

34
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:25,830
our guest this week is Jim Egan jim has

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,540
been working for plant revolution for

36
00:01:25,829 --> 00:01:29,728
more than a decade having been the first

37
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:32,009
company to bring mycorrhizal inoculants

38
00:01:29,728 --> 00:01:33,328
to commercial applications he and the

39
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:35,430
company have been spreading the good

40
00:01:33,328 --> 00:01:37,739
news of the benefits of healthy soil to

41
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:39,750
gardeners landscapers and farmers all

42
00:01:37,739 --> 00:01:41,938
over the world his degree in

43
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:43,649
environmental studies his work in the

44
00:01:41,938 --> 00:01:45,898
permaculture community and his

45
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:47,430
experience running a small farm form a

46
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:49,320
background that has given him a deep

47
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:51,750
understanding of the importance of soil

48
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:54,000
organisms for plant and ecosystem health

49
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,438
he continues to learn and explore the

50
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,790
fascinating worlds of food production

51
00:01:55,438 --> 00:02:01,048
native ecosystems and sustainability

52
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:03,899
all right thanks Jim I really appreciate

53
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:06,210
you coming on the show yeah I think that

54
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:07,978
really excited to be here so let's just

55
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:10,409
start off and dive right in talking

56
00:02:07,978 --> 00:02:11,969
about mycorrhizae and mycorrhizal fungus

57
00:02:10,409 --> 00:02:13,409
would you go ahead and I know we've

58
00:02:11,969 --> 00:02:13,719
talked about it with previous guests but

59
00:02:13,409 --> 00:02:16,090
can you

60
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:18,069
give us a brief introduction into what

61
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:20,020
mycorrhizae is for people that may be

62
00:02:18,069 --> 00:02:21,430
new to the new the subject before we

63
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:24,730
dive into the little little tougher

64
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:27,849
questions yeah no problem

65
00:02:24,729 --> 00:02:32,019
essentially mycorrhizae means fungus

66
00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:35,530
root and it's a very important grouping

67
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:38,650
of fungus that exists in the natural

68
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:40,990
environment and it literally is a fungus

69
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:42,700
that lives on the roots of plants so it

70
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:46,990
has a really hard time producing its own

71
00:02:42,699 --> 00:02:49,689
food namely carbohydrates and sugars but

72
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:53,350
actually has partnered with plants and

73
00:02:49,689 --> 00:02:55,120
it did this as far back as we can tell

74
00:02:53,349 --> 00:02:57,819
in the fossil record so plants when they

75
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,129
first came on land from oceans had very

76
00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:03,879
primitive root systems and it was this

77
00:03:00,129 --> 00:03:05,139
coming together of fungus and ocean

78
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:09,400
plant you can think of it as like a

79
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:12,399
holdfast for a seaweed right so the

80
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:14,050
mycorrhizae fungi allowed much more

81
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,780
surface area so it's much finer than

82
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:19,930
root hairs and it basically would cover

83
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:21,909
the arid land and absorb water and

84
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:23,140
nutrients it would break down minerals

85
00:03:21,909 --> 00:03:26,349
all the things we're going to be talking

86
00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:29,799
about but it covered these root systems

87
00:03:26,349 --> 00:03:32,109
and eventually formed with about 95

88
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:34,120
percent of the world's plants and this

89
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:36,820
includes you know the early nonvascular

90
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:42,099
plants from hornworts and liverworts and

91
00:03:36,819 --> 00:03:44,590
mosses to you know the giant redwoods

92
00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:46,870
and conifers and flowers and vegetables

93
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:49,959
so almost all of the world's plants

94
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:52,360
formed with this soil fungus and it's a

95
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:54,909
little bit different from saprophytic

96
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:57,040
fungi which sort of exists independently

97
00:03:54,909 --> 00:04:01,120
and break things down in the forest this

98
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:04,659
stuff relies on a host plant so that's a

99
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:08,680
very brief overview many any of those

100
00:04:04,659 --> 00:04:11,250
topics we could have spent many minutes

101
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:13,330
on but that's just a very brief overview

102
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:15,939
no that was great I do want to highlight

103
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:19,299
a couple other things too for people so

104
00:04:15,939 --> 00:04:21,189
for those of you that are you know I

105
00:04:19,298 --> 00:04:22,149
know this is a cannabis podcast but we

106
00:04:21,189 --> 00:04:24,550
get a lot of people that are growing

107
00:04:22,149 --> 00:04:27,189
other plants too now there's many

108
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:27,699
different types of mycorrhizae fungi

109
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:30,610
which we

110
00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:32,908
we can talk about in depth the main ones

111
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:35,468
being you know endo mycorrhizal fungus

112
00:04:32,908 --> 00:04:38,050
ecto my gradual fungus and then there's

113
00:04:35,468 --> 00:04:40,180
another one called era coid as well

114
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:43,689
which I always associate with azaleas

115
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:45,908
and rhododendrons but it's important to

116
00:04:43,689 --> 00:04:48,968
realize that there are different types

117
00:04:45,908 --> 00:04:50,500
of micro Raizel fungus can you talk a

118
00:04:48,968 --> 00:04:52,598
little bit about what those types are

119
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,800
and which plants they associate with as

120
00:04:52,598 --> 00:04:55,240
well as the you know things like

121
00:04:53,800 --> 00:05:01,300
brassicas that don't have that

122
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:02,829
relationship yeah absolutely so like I

123
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:05,829
said there's there's a couple of a

124
00:05:02,829 --> 00:05:07,778
couple broad groups there's the endo

125
00:05:05,829 --> 00:05:10,418
mycorrhizae and the echo micro z are

126
00:05:07,778 --> 00:05:12,459
probably the two biggest they also have

127
00:05:10,418 --> 00:05:15,758
things like iroquois mycorrhizae and

128
00:05:12,459 --> 00:05:18,250
even orchids have their own sort of

129
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:21,960
partnering microSD interestingly enough

130
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:24,519
and really the two main types that

131
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:28,120
commercially and practically we concern

132
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:30,878
ourselves with are these endo and ecto

133
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:33,250
and so endo mycorrhizae is what we're

134
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:36,819
all familiar with it's also called our

135
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:38,649
bus cooler mycorrhizae or VAM vesicular

136
00:05:36,819 --> 00:05:40,750
our bus cooler mycorrhizae those are two

137
00:05:38,649 --> 00:05:44,888
structures that it forms testicles and

138
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:47,379
our bus fuels and platforms with roughly

139
00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:49,028
about 85% of plants so that's the types

140
00:05:47,379 --> 00:05:51,310
of forms of cannabis it forms with

141
00:05:49,028 --> 00:05:53,800
vegetables it forms with fruit trees and

142
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:57,098
really that the main type that we deal

143
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:59,949
with in commercial uses the other type

144
00:05:57,098 --> 00:06:02,468
is called techno micros with fungi and

145
00:05:59,949 --> 00:06:06,250
this forms mainly with your conifers

146
00:06:02,468 --> 00:06:09,218
your you know your Oaks other hardwoods

147
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:11,439
and things like that and that forms with

148
00:06:09,218 --> 00:06:14,379
roughly about you know 10 to 12 percent

149
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:16,750
of the world's plants it's much more

150
00:06:14,379 --> 00:06:19,150
ubiquitous in the environment so I was

151
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:21,098
on a conference call earlier this

152
00:06:19,149 --> 00:06:23,888
morning to just kind of walking around

153
00:06:21,098 --> 00:06:26,560
the garden outside here and I literally

154
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:29,079
found a giant fruiting body of one of

155
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,399
these ecto mycorrhizal fungi so they're

156
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:32,500
really they're everywhere you're

157
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:38,079
probably breathing in the spores right

158
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:40,899
now but those yeah so that forms another

159
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:41,500
big portion of the microbes will French

160
00:06:40,899 --> 00:06:44,529
I out there

161
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:47,230
and then like you said the iroquois form

162
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:51,099
with you know kind of your your acid

163
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:53,850
soils your acid loving plants so you

164
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:56,890
know cranberries huckleberries

165
00:06:53,850 --> 00:07:00,160
rhododendrons things like that and then

166
00:06:56,889 --> 00:07:03,099
we also have which so those they're not

167
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,080
as stable and easy to produce and also

168
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:08,470
that's a much smaller grouping of plants

169
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:10,750
that they form with so it's as far as I

170
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:12,310
know those inoculum aren't very

171
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:14,860
available on the market

172
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:16,600
same thing when it's orchid micro so now

173
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:18,759
I'm sure orchid growers probably have

174
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:21,850
access to that or they culture their own

175
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:24,909
you know but generally those two types

176
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:28,390
really aren't available on on the market

177
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:30,160
either retail or commercial and then you

178
00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:31,810
know yeah the plants that don't form

179
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:37,030
which actually there are a lot of weeds

180
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:39,668
so there are a lot of the sort of plants

181
00:07:37,029 --> 00:07:41,709
that thrive in disturbed soils right so

182
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:43,750
they're the the pioneer plants as we

183
00:07:41,709 --> 00:07:46,569
call them in permaculture and and they

184
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:48,040
come in and they don't need a lot right

185
00:07:46,569 --> 00:07:50,349
they can survive they can break through

186
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:53,200
concrete and and you've seen like a

187
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:55,540
dandelion things like that so these are

188
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,879
plants that have that have evolved and

189
00:07:55,540 --> 00:08:00,850
just really never had a need for this

190
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:03,310
mycorrhizal symbiosis which is a really

191
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:05,350
interesting thing but yeah there are

192
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:07,149
small grouping of plants and luckily for

193
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:09,370
gardeners a lot of them are weeds that

194
00:08:07,149 --> 00:08:11,978
don't really need a Mike Reiser

195
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:14,259
relationship and in fact mycorrhizae

196
00:08:11,978 --> 00:08:18,639
actually helps deter these a little bit

197
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:20,289
in one's garden so yeah that's kind of a

198
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,689
broad overview of all the different

199
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:25,169
types now if we were growing something

200
00:08:22,689 --> 00:08:28,300
though like cauliflower or broccoli

201
00:08:25,168 --> 00:08:29,889
which does not have a microbial

202
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:32,908
relationship aren't there studies that

203
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:35,799
show it actually will potentially be

204
00:08:32,908 --> 00:08:37,360
detrimental to the plant if if it does

205
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:39,218
form that relationship so we want to be

206
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,399
careful and how we're applying it into

207
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:44,080
which plants to my knowledge they don't

208
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:47,350
form that relationship so it's not

209
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:50,650
really like a fungal forcing onto the

210
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:53,639
plants it's the plant really chooses

211
00:08:50,649 --> 00:08:55,299
which my crazy to let in and in fact

212
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:58,809
plants can act

213
00:08:55,299 --> 00:09:01,120
turn off and changed the mycorrhizae

214
00:08:58,809 --> 00:09:05,500
that they're forming with throughout a

215
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:09,100
season the same plant to get its needs

216
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:10,809
met so you know if it needs you know

217
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:13,180
more micronutrients there's their

218
00:09:10,809 --> 00:09:15,309
species that are more depth in getting

219
00:09:13,179 --> 00:09:17,500
you know maybe zinc or something like

220
00:09:15,309 --> 00:09:19,149
that out of the soil and so the plant

221
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:22,299
will actually ship the mycorrhizae that

222
00:09:19,149 --> 00:09:24,309
it's forming with so the only thing that

223
00:09:22,299 --> 00:09:26,349
I can think of is that you know in a

224
00:09:24,309 --> 00:09:27,699
heavily Mike ride will dominated soil if

225
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:29,409
you have other plants growing with

226
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:31,870
mycorrhizal fungi maybe it's out

227
00:09:29,409 --> 00:09:33,610
competing the brassicas but I've never

228
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:36,690
heard of it being detrimental to brass

229
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:39,519
because that would be a new one to me

230
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:42,370
but yeah I'd love to learn more about

231
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:45,939
that ya know I thought I'd read a study

232
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:47,679
where it showed that it is possible to

233
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:50,560
form that relationship but it's actually

234
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:53,379
detrimental to the plant but it's not a

235
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:55,809
natural Association I know it was a long

236
00:09:53,379 --> 00:09:57,159
time ago and I could be wrong I haven't

237
00:09:55,809 --> 00:10:01,629
brushed up on it in quite a while

238
00:09:57,159 --> 00:10:02,469
honestly so right know if you do find

239
00:10:01,629 --> 00:10:04,389
out anything let me know

240
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:06,160
one thing you did bring up though that I

241
00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:08,319
want to go back to is you mentioned you

242
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:13,120
saw a fruiting body or a mushroom of an

243
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:14,200
ecto mycorrhizal fungus and that's

244
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,179
something that I see with a lot of

245
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:18,700
growers is a couple things out there

246
00:10:16,179 --> 00:10:20,169
where you see photos of roots and people

247
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:22,060
are you know let's say you choose

248
00:10:20,169 --> 00:10:24,459
cannabis in this case and they may see a

249
00:10:22,059 --> 00:10:26,349
bunch of mycelium and say oh that's you

250
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:28,509
know that's our my mycorrhizae or though

251
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:29,230
they'll see mushrooms popping up in

252
00:10:28,509 --> 00:10:30,970
there

253
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:32,350
you know indoor cannabis garden and

254
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:34,570
they'll say that that's because they

255
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:36,940
have a micro Raizel relationship now as

256
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:37,300
I understand it feel free to correct me

257
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:40,210
here

258
00:10:37,299 --> 00:10:43,750
the endo mycorrhizal fungus you can't

259
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:45,340
see without special microscope tools to

260
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:47,590
dye their roots to see if they're

261
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:49,330
actually infected and then those

262
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:51,430
particular Glomus species don't

263
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:53,820
necessarily form fruiting bodies or

264
00:10:51,429 --> 00:10:56,169
mushrooms is that is that accurate

265
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,730
hundred-percent yeah yeah so what

266
00:10:56,169 --> 00:10:59,799
they're what they're seeing is probably

267
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:01,480
some saprophytic fungi that has found

268
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:04,899
its way and it's breaking down organic

269
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:07,300
matter so the most common one is the the

270
00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:08,480
the flower pot it's a little yellow

271
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:12,919
mushroom and

272
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:14,990
what's it called flowerpot forget the

273
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:19,879
exact species a cydia more something

274
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:22,730
like that and that is it's just pot

275
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:26,870
culture conditions so growing plants and

276
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:28,639
soil and pots is just the ultimate

277
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:31,549
environment for this stuff so it

278
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:33,559
hitchhikes in on a lot of you know maybe

279
00:11:31,549 --> 00:11:36,740
it was probably in the soil to begin

280
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:39,229
with or just finds its way in there and

281
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:40,789
that comes up that's coming up in my

282
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:42,639
houseplants right now but we get guys

283
00:11:40,789 --> 00:11:45,230
that will send us pictures of that and

284
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:46,970
no that has nothing to do with the end

285
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:48,889
oh my cries will fungi you're correct

286
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:51,500
and that they don't form fruiting bodies

287
00:11:48,889 --> 00:11:53,960
which is why and we'll get into this

288
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:56,090
there's so little study they really are

289
00:11:53,960 --> 00:12:00,830
if you look at the studies it's like two

290
00:11:56,090 --> 00:12:03,920
or three species that's tops and you

291
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:07,790
know the estimated numbers at this point

292
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:09,019
is is over 300 and that's including

293
00:12:07,789 --> 00:12:12,529
that's all the ones we don't know about

294
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:14,179
so we've only studied a small portion of

295
00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:16,179
them because they don't form fruiting

296
00:12:14,179 --> 00:12:18,439
bodies so essentially yeah they have to

297
00:12:16,179 --> 00:12:19,969
you know they have to isolate these

298
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:23,000
spores they have to pull them out of

299
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:24,680
soils they have to they can pull some of

300
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,289
the mycelium which like you said is

301
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:31,069
smaller then it's visible to the naked

302
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:32,919
eye you can see ecto mycorrhizae is it

303
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:35,240
forms these things called rhizome Morse

304
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:38,719
which is like a lot of strains of

305
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:40,879
mycelium kind of coagulated together so

306
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,500
you can actually see that which is that

307
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:44,929
famous picture if you've ever googled

308
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:47,149
mycorrhizae it's different species of

309
00:12:44,929 --> 00:12:50,419
pines but on their root systems it's

310
00:12:47,149 --> 00:12:52,819
this big sort of hair net of mycelium

311
00:12:50,419 --> 00:12:54,500
radiating out in all directions so you

312
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:58,610
can see that because that's an ecto

313
00:12:54,500 --> 00:13:00,740
mycorrhizae but you're correct in that

314
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:04,460
these mushrooms are not connected to the

315
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:07,100
mycelium and growers you won't really be

316
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:09,230
able to see the mycelium with the naked

317
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:13,070
eye now you will probably see a strong

318
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:19,519
healthy root system you know we can talk

319
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:22,310
about that later but just the so there's

320
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,990
some things that I can't

321
00:13:22,309 --> 00:13:25,879
talk about we can't make any claims

322
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:30,009
whatsoever about our products because

323
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:32,659
we're not registered as a pesticide so

324
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:35,689
but if you google some of these species

325
00:13:32,659 --> 00:13:37,519
you'll see that you know there there are

326
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:39,260
benefits from the fungus that when you

327
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:44,360
pull a root system out and there's it's

328
00:13:39,259 --> 00:13:45,710
white you know it's there's not I should

329
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,570
be very careful in how I say this but

330
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:49,028
there's not certain things the color is

331
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:53,210
the color that you want

332
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:56,809
the roots are vibrant that indicates you

333
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:59,360
know often times that it has the strong

334
00:13:56,809 --> 00:14:00,500
my mycorrhizal relationship and

335
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,870
everything's functioning as it should

336
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:05,059
all the micronutrients are making it up

337
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:07,610
and all the you know the different

338
00:14:05,059 --> 00:14:10,459
chemicals that the plant forms with that

339
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:12,019
to protect itself for all functioning

340
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:15,350
properly

341
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:17,480
but yeah so you can't actually see the

342
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:21,050
mycelium if you were to pull out a root

343
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:23,000
system so you know I think I think it's

344
00:14:21,049 --> 00:14:24,859
safe to say that plants that are

345
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:29,570
healthier are less susceptible to

346
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:31,100
diseases and other pathogens so a plant

347
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:33,379
that may that has a micro Raizel

348
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:34,730
association may in theory be a little

349
00:14:33,379 --> 00:14:36,799
bit healthier than a plant that doesn't

350
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:39,050
because most plants like you mentioned

351
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:41,329
95% them what to have this relationship

352
00:14:39,049 --> 00:14:43,609
and can you talk about some of the

353
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:46,910
benefits and how they may differ between

354
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:48,710
endo and ecto micro Issac is with the

355
00:14:46,909 --> 00:14:51,019
ecto you're on the outside of the roots

356
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:54,110
like you mentioned it's reaching out

357
00:14:51,019 --> 00:14:58,039
into the soil the the endo is infecting

358
00:14:54,110 --> 00:15:00,980
into the root itself what what are the

359
00:14:58,039 --> 00:15:03,909
differences in the benefits of these

360
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:08,539
these two types of micro Raizel fungus

361
00:15:03,909 --> 00:15:12,980
yeah so generally with both types you

362
00:15:08,539 --> 00:15:16,219
see increased surface area so like I

363
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:18,320
said the the the first coming together

364
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:21,610
of these organisms was because plants

365
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:25,640
root systems weren't the purpose wasn't

366
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:28,159
mineral nutrient absorption it wasn't to

367
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:30,019
break down minerals and nutrients you

368
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:32,360
know it wasn't to absorb water they came

369
00:15:30,019 --> 00:15:34,279
from environments that those things were

370
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:36,139
in and sort of a kind of an aqueous

371
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:41,269
solution in the ocean

372
00:15:36,139 --> 00:15:44,328
so one thing you get is you get much

373
00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:46,730
more surface area so the mycelium

374
00:15:44,328 --> 00:15:48,109
essentially radiates out but you have

375
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:51,170
right around the roof it's called the

376
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:54,860
phosphorus depletion zone so plants when

377
00:15:51,169 --> 00:15:56,750
they're you know first given nutrients

378
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:58,940
bill they'll eat up all the phosphorus

379
00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:02,360
and nutrients right around the root zone

380
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:04,130
and so what these mycelium do is they

381
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,778
sort of poke out through that so they

382
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:09,259
radiate through that and they get much

383
00:16:05,778 --> 00:16:12,799
more surface area able to take up those

384
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:14,958
minerals and nutrients you also see they

385
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:17,479
release exudates in the soil they

386
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:21,229
release enzymes into the soil which

387
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:23,690
makes nutrients that get locked up but

388
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:25,610
once again bioavailable so they they

389
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:27,170
make that bet available to the plant the

390
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:34,039
phosphorus and the nitrogen and the

391
00:16:27,169 --> 00:16:40,129
micronutrients so yeah there's uh you

392
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:45,379
know a couple other benefits so they can

393
00:16:40,129 --> 00:16:48,259
actually fix nitrogen atmospheric

394
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:49,730
nitrogen just like the the bacteria

395
00:16:48,259 --> 00:16:52,009
there's some bacteria out there we even

396
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:54,610
in our blends we have bacteria that do

397
00:16:52,009 --> 00:16:57,379
this as well it's not the risin

398
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:59,329
Rhizobium bacteria like in a like in a

399
00:16:57,379 --> 00:17:02,629
legume it's actually free living

400
00:16:59,328 --> 00:17:06,009
bacteria but also the the mycorrhizae

401
00:17:02,629 --> 00:17:09,558
fungi can fix atmospheric nitrogen which

402
00:17:06,009 --> 00:17:13,269
people don't know not many people are

403
00:17:09,558 --> 00:17:16,789
aware of that's one piece of it so

404
00:17:13,269 --> 00:17:19,279
stress on the plant transplant shock

405
00:17:16,789 --> 00:17:22,599
when the plants transplanted its sending

406
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:26,750
out chemicals into the soil to actually

407
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:29,480
germinate any my gradual spores around

408
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:30,798
it when I seed germinates in nature it's

409
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:34,610
immediately sending out these signals

410
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:38,210
because it's it's grown and evolved if

411
00:17:34,609 --> 00:17:40,849
say to have this symbiosis so it's it's

412
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:43,789
it's used to having these ambient spores

413
00:17:40,849 --> 00:17:45,319
around in its soil environment so once

414
00:17:43,789 --> 00:17:46,549
this germinate

415
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:48,409
you know through all these mechanisms

416
00:17:46,549 --> 00:17:50,029
that I've been talking about and ones

417
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:52,250
that we haven't mentioned yet

418
00:17:50,029 --> 00:17:55,789
it allows the stress tolerance of the

419
00:17:52,250 --> 00:18:00,230
plant to go up so too little water too

420
00:17:55,789 --> 00:18:02,899
much water variances and pH variances in

421
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:04,759
temperature the plants actually going to

422
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:07,790
be able to withstand that and actually

423
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:09,740
thrive through that a lot better than if

424
00:18:07,789 --> 00:18:13,670
you didn't have the my gradual

425
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:16,339
association and that's really one of the

426
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:18,740
benefits of mycorrhizal fungi and

427
00:18:16,339 --> 00:18:22,879
actually one of the reasons that we'll

428
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:24,859
get into diversity later but you know

429
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,110
once one thing that these that these

430
00:18:24,859 --> 00:18:30,139
inoculants do is they allow you to bring

431
00:18:27,109 --> 00:18:33,169
your your baseline up so your

432
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:35,480
worst-performing plants does a lot

433
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:37,160
better now your best performing plant if

434
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:39,650
everything lines up for that plant and

435
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:41,930
and you know your ph is right on all

436
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:44,900
your nutrients are right on everything's

437
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:46,480
perfect and that plant does great you

438
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:49,040
know you're not going to get a 10%

439
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:52,309
increase in yield no matter what anyone

440
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:56,509
tells you but not everything's perfect

441
00:18:52,309 --> 00:18:58,669
and really what these inoculants do and

442
00:18:56,509 --> 00:19:01,609
what mycorrhizae specialty is is it

443
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:03,800
brings that that sort of I don't think

444
00:19:01,609 --> 00:19:06,589
the law of minimums where it brings your

445
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:10,819
poorest performing plants up to a higher

446
00:19:06,589 --> 00:19:12,889
level so overall you're getting a more

447
00:19:10,819 --> 00:19:15,470
stable yield you're getting a more

448
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:17,780
consistent yield and that's actually one

449
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:20,529
of the reasons just briefly why we

450
00:19:17,779 --> 00:19:25,720
included diversity in our blends because

451
00:19:20,529 --> 00:19:31,279
specific microbes will species perform

452
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:34,490
different functions so like give you an

453
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:38,480
example you Guam is Claira one of the

454
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:44,059
Glomus species it helps with dealing

455
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:46,930
with excess salts it improves mediation

456
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:49,609
of heavy metals heavy metal toxicity

457
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:56,750
Glomus desert Accola comes from arid

458
00:19:49,609 --> 00:20:00,259
regions it's better at drought stress so

459
00:19:56,750 --> 00:20:02,809
let's say Glomus ma say it reduces

460
00:20:00,259 --> 00:20:03,890
uptake of arsenic one interesting

461
00:20:02,809 --> 00:20:05,899
example but

462
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:08,060
they all have these different sort of

463
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:09,820
specialties and so when the plant

464
00:20:08,059 --> 00:20:12,710
encounters something that it's

465
00:20:09,819 --> 00:20:16,700
detrimental to its growth it literally

466
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:18,980
will change directions and start to

467
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:21,380
utilize whatever species that can

468
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:25,640
perform those functions that it needs

469
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:28,700
now in terms of your question about endo

470
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:32,030
versus ecto to be honest I need to

471
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:36,170
research that I have never actually been

472
00:20:32,029 --> 00:20:40,250
asked that and yeah I'd be really

473
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:43,490
curious to hear the differences in the

474
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:45,049
different benefits of the different sort

475
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:46,670
of morphologies how they work in the

476
00:20:45,049 --> 00:20:49,819
root zone how that translates into the

477
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:51,920
ecosystem and one thing you touched on

478
00:20:49,819 --> 00:20:54,349
if yeah EXO grow kind of between the

479
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:55,519
root cells and endo grow into the root

480
00:20:54,349 --> 00:20:57,949
cell and they form these little

481
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:59,450
structures which just kind of tell

482
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:01,490
people this is why it's called Arbus Q

483
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:03,319
or busk Euler mycorrhizae is that they

484
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:05,240
go into the root cell form these little

485
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:06,859
structures that look like root systems

486
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:09,589
and that's actually where the water and

487
00:21:06,859 --> 00:21:13,009
their own nutrients are traded to the

488
00:21:09,589 --> 00:21:16,789
plant through a there's a small little

489
00:21:13,009 --> 00:21:18,980
membrane around Arbus fuel and in

490
00:21:16,789 --> 00:21:20,629
exchange for that it gets sugars and

491
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:22,789
carbohydrates that like I said earlier

492
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:24,980
it can't produce itself through that

493
00:21:22,789 --> 00:21:28,909
structure inside the root cells why or I

494
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:30,319
think of it as endo in but yeah in terms

495
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:32,690
of the difference between the endo and

496
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:39,139
the ecto on the in the benefits realm

497
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:40,850
I'd actually be curious myself I think

498
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:42,530
the important thing for people to keep

499
00:21:40,849 --> 00:21:43,969
in mind is that you want to make sure

500
00:21:42,529 --> 00:21:47,450
you have the right species for what

501
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:49,190
you're what you're planting and you know

502
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:51,590
there's if you're not planting conifers

503
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:53,720
do those ecto species have benefit I

504
00:21:51,589 --> 00:21:55,909
know you and I have talked previously to

505
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:58,519
this and I've been a big proponent of

506
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:59,990
single species inoculation because all

507
00:21:58,519 --> 00:22:03,230
of the research that we see out there is

508
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:05,329
primarily with Glomus ensure a disease

509
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:07,759
or rise of Vegas and sure a disease now

510
00:22:05,329 --> 00:22:09,919
as they're calling it and the Glomus

511
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:11,720
Moss a or however however you pronounce

512
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:15,740
it I think that was the researcher that

513
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:17,089
discovered it but those are the two most

514
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:19,970
widely

515
00:22:17,089 --> 00:22:21,980
and most widely available and I'm I'm

516
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:25,360
just curious what research you've seen

517
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:28,400
that would support using more diverse

518
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:32,509
diverse species of micro so in a micro

519
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:34,580
eyes'll product yeah so the big one is

520
00:22:32,509 --> 00:22:36,259
endo versus EXO right yeah clearly if

521
00:22:34,579 --> 00:22:39,169
you're not growing EKKO plants you don't

522
00:22:36,259 --> 00:22:40,609
there's not a need for the ecto so yeah

523
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:42,980
we have a number of products you have a

524
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:48,250
single species and though we have four

525
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:53,240
species and though we have a diverse

526
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:55,400
multiple species endo and ecto so we

527
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:58,700
support all kind of directions that the

528
00:22:55,400 --> 00:23:00,800
market is going but yeah

529
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:03,680
clearly you don't need ecto if you're

530
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:05,480
not growing in ecto plant the reason

531
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:08,150
that we've included it in some of our

532
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:10,490
blends over the years is it's like I

533
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:12,380
said it's ubiquitous it's literally you

534
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:15,470
know almost pennies per pound for us to

535
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:19,990
include it for example you know in a

536
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:26,269
gram of our popular product there's

537
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:30,140
played out maybe like 250 speed spores

538
00:23:26,269 --> 00:23:32,359
of endo all I mean Ellis is right this

539
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:35,890
is one gram of material you got about

540
00:23:32,359 --> 00:23:39,709
two to three hundred spores of viendo

541
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:42,860
you have a couple million spores of the

542
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:46,309
ecto so they're much smaller than the

543
00:23:42,859 --> 00:23:47,869
endo and they're super super cheap to

544
00:23:46,309 --> 00:23:49,819
produce they're literally you know

545
00:23:47,869 --> 00:23:52,129
coming up we harvest those wild so we

546
00:23:49,819 --> 00:23:54,159
harvest those fruiting bodies wild and

547
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:57,530
what that did for us was allow people

548
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:59,509
you know allow our blends to be used in

549
00:23:57,529 --> 00:24:01,369
a diverse array of environments the

550
00:23:59,509 --> 00:24:03,680
specific ones where we decided to

551
00:24:01,369 --> 00:24:07,250
include both we made them really easy

552
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:10,100
for the end consumer and so you know

553
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:11,509
that was probably ten years ago we came

554
00:24:10,099 --> 00:24:13,849
out with those products and sort of as

555
00:24:11,509 --> 00:24:16,069
people the market developed and people

556
00:24:13,849 --> 00:24:18,619
were saying saying you know we just want

557
00:24:16,069 --> 00:24:20,329
the endo and we just want the bacteria

558
00:24:18,619 --> 00:24:23,839
you know we don't want everything

559
00:24:20,329 --> 00:24:25,849
included we started to broaden our

560
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:27,769
product offerings so yeah we have

561
00:24:25,849 --> 00:24:29,839
products that are just endo and bacteria

562
00:24:27,769 --> 00:24:30,779
and then like I said we have to just end

563
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:33,419
up

564
00:24:30,779 --> 00:24:37,230
so there's no absolutely no detrimental

565
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:38,700
effect having the ecto in there but yeah

566
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:40,170
like you said you know if you're not

567
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:43,970
forming with the conifer it's not

568
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:46,080
absolutely necessary but you know it's

569
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:49,019
one of my favorite products that we

570
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:51,449
still do is the great white in terms of

571
00:24:49,019 --> 00:24:53,730
bacteria and endo mycorrhizae even if

572
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:55,920
you weren't even you know considering

573
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:58,980
the ecto for the value the value that

574
00:24:55,920 --> 00:25:02,100
you get the concentration of endo and

575
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:03,870
the bacteria in there is really

576
00:25:02,099 --> 00:25:05,819
unrivaled in the market you'd really

577
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:08,549
have to buy two separate products that

578
00:25:05,819 --> 00:25:12,960
you know almost double the price to get

579
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:15,029
those concentrations but yeah I mean I

580
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,829
get it I totally get it you know if

581
00:25:15,029 --> 00:25:21,000
you're not growing a connoisseur there's

582
00:25:16,829 --> 00:25:22,409
no need for it but yeah they still they

583
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,099
still prove to be super effective

584
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:29,040
products if they do have bit of blend in

585
00:25:26,099 --> 00:25:32,069
there but yeah we support you know one

586
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:34,200
species for species like the great white

587
00:25:32,069 --> 00:25:36,089
that's eight species of endo now

588
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:39,210
specifically talking about endo

589
00:25:36,089 --> 00:25:40,529
diversity what the what what our

590
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:43,740
research is showing and what the

591
00:25:40,529 --> 00:25:46,980
research is is kind of beginning to

592
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:49,650
reveal because it's in the past it's

593
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:52,860
basically this stuff is very little

594
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:54,660
studied like you said we have the the

595
00:25:52,859 --> 00:25:58,219
Glomus irregularity Alma Center a

596
00:25:54,660 --> 00:26:00,690
disease you have Glomus mas a Glomus

597
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:02,819
aggregate um so you have a few species

598
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:04,230
that have been studied and and really

599
00:26:02,819 --> 00:26:07,859
they've only been studied for a very

600
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:10,529
limited kind of set of parameters or

601
00:26:07,859 --> 00:26:12,529
they're not testing for it's tough to

602
00:26:10,529 --> 00:26:14,460
test for all the whole the the

603
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:16,859
conditions that are out there all the

604
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:20,720
reasons people might be using these

605
00:26:16,859 --> 00:26:23,729
inoculum xand in the actual field and so

606
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:26,850
sort of the thinking this has been

607
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:28,680
passed on I'm not the researcher you

608
00:26:26,849 --> 00:26:31,319
know this has been passed on from sort

609
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:33,090
of our research department and our

610
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:35,099
scientists and and they're continuing

611
00:26:33,089 --> 00:26:37,339
actually to to isolate different species

612
00:26:35,099 --> 00:26:42,209
and begin to test those for their

613
00:26:37,339 --> 00:26:44,928
viability in the market and you know

614
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:47,759
what what was passed on to me is that

615
00:26:44,929 --> 00:26:50,609
that having diversity for first of all

616
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:55,710
my ethos is diversity right so

617
00:26:50,608 --> 00:27:00,778
permaculture and ecology sort of dictate

618
00:26:55,710 --> 00:27:05,069
that as a principle diversity it's more

619
00:27:00,778 --> 00:27:07,169
resilient so how that works out into the

620
00:27:05,069 --> 00:27:09,239
mycorrhizal sphere is it's just like I

621
00:27:07,169 --> 00:27:11,700
said all of these mycorrhizal species

622
00:27:09,239 --> 00:27:14,129
have different specialties so Glomus

623
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:17,308
inter a disease is known as a broad

624
00:27:14,128 --> 00:27:21,298
former it forms early and it's grated up

625
00:27:17,308 --> 00:27:25,230
taking phosphorus but that's not the

626
00:27:21,298 --> 00:27:27,269
only sort of problem that growers are

627
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:32,159
facing you know there's all sorts of

628
00:27:27,269 --> 00:27:35,450
conditions you know you have pH problems

629
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:39,499
you have temperature problems you have

630
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:41,489
disease problems you have sort of

631
00:27:39,499 --> 00:27:44,669
micronutrient deficiencies you have

632
00:27:41,489 --> 00:27:47,899
nutrient sort of lockout you have all of

633
00:27:44,669 --> 00:27:51,840
these things that the plant needs to

634
00:27:47,898 --> 00:27:55,709
well either the plant figures out a way

635
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:59,579
to overcome these problems or it shows

636
00:27:55,710 --> 00:28:02,340
up you know as a reduction in yield or

637
00:27:59,579 --> 00:28:04,678
some sort of resolve seeing deficiencies

638
00:28:02,339 --> 00:28:05,908
and our leaves and then those sorts of

639
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:07,590
things and it kind of talks about

640
00:28:05,909 --> 00:28:12,450
further you know the plants natural

641
00:28:07,589 --> 00:28:14,849
defenses they actually rely on the

642
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:19,889
ability to get micronutrients and to get

643
00:28:14,849 --> 00:28:22,048
these you know just water and all of

644
00:28:19,888 --> 00:28:24,089
these other things to actually form

645
00:28:22,048 --> 00:28:29,579
these compounds and form these different

646
00:28:24,089 --> 00:28:30,480
chemicals and exudates and things like

647
00:28:29,579 --> 00:28:33,210
that

648
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:36,058
which can actually keep the plant

649
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:39,569
growing - you know maximizing its

650
00:28:36,058 --> 00:28:42,628
genetic potential so with the my gradual

651
00:28:39,569 --> 00:28:44,939
fungi like I said what we've seen is the

652
00:28:42,628 --> 00:28:47,959
plant is actually able to cut off flow

653
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:50,548
of nutrients to specific species and

654
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:52,528
throughout the season switch that over

655
00:28:50,548 --> 00:28:55,548
to other species that are actually

656
00:28:52,528 --> 00:28:57,720
taking care of and have the ability to

657
00:28:55,548 --> 00:28:58,500
solve the problem that the plant is

658
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,630
facing

659
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:02,400
and that can happen throughout the

660
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:04,500
course of a season or that can just

661
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:06,570
happen straight out of the gate

662
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:10,410
especially with this kind of moving more

663
00:29:06,569 --> 00:29:13,049
into broadacre applications you know

664
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:15,870
there's so many different conditions and

665
00:29:13,049 --> 00:29:20,039
environments that growers are facing

666
00:29:15,869 --> 00:29:23,179
right so different pH is different soil

667
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:25,740
makeups right different soil chemistry's

668
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:29,789
different climates all those sorts of

669
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:32,700
things you know one my gradual species

670
00:29:29,789 --> 00:29:35,460
is somewhat limited in its ability to

671
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:37,830
overcome those various problems with the

672
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:41,730
plant is facing whereas a diversity of

673
00:29:37,829 --> 00:29:46,559
species does have the tool belt sort of

674
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:48,630
in the tool chest if you will to solve

675
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:51,779
those problems and and create those

676
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:54,270
compounds and be able to adapt to the

677
00:29:51,779 --> 00:29:58,649
situation so that's really like I said

678
00:29:54,269 --> 00:30:01,529
we offer single species but we promote

679
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:05,790
diverse species within those groupings

680
00:30:01,529 --> 00:30:07,769
right endo versus ecto so that's what

681
00:30:05,789 --> 00:30:10,849
we're seeing and that's kind of what

682
00:30:07,769 --> 00:30:13,589
we've how we built our NOC ulam

683
00:30:10,849 --> 00:30:15,750
any inoculation is great if you're using

684
00:30:13,589 --> 00:30:17,309
single species you know multiple species

685
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:20,789
your plants really going to see a

686
00:30:17,309 --> 00:30:25,230
benefit so you mentioned that the plant

687
00:30:20,789 --> 00:30:30,420
can switch its mycorrhizal association

688
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:32,210
or infection mid mid lifecycle how does

689
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:34,380
that work then let's let's take a

690
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:37,289
cannabis cycle for example where you

691
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:41,160
have a plant that may only have 55 60

692
00:30:37,289 --> 00:30:43,670
days flowering time are you saying that

693
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:46,680
the plant could start off with a say a

694
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:49,230
relationship with Glomus enter a disease

695
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:51,210
or Rago phase Rezo vegas inter a disease

696
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:53,339
and then switch halfway through to

697
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:55,980
something else say if conditions change

698
00:30:53,339 --> 00:30:58,559
like to the Glomus desert Accola for

699
00:30:55,980 --> 00:31:01,710
example or can it have multiple

700
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:04,139
infections within the same plant of

701
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:06,299
different species at the same time on

702
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:08,620
say different different root hairs or

703
00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:10,569
root tips

704
00:31:08,619 --> 00:31:12,219
that's what I've yeah that's the

705
00:31:10,569 --> 00:31:15,099
information that I've been passed on is

706
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:20,410
that both of those scenarios can can

707
00:31:15,099 --> 00:31:22,449
happen was mycorrhizal fungi so yeah

708
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:24,400
yeah to my knowledge that that is

709
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:26,558
possible with both of them and like I

710
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:28,390
said all this stuff needs to be studied

711
00:31:26,558 --> 00:31:32,289
further and especially as cannabis is

712
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:35,980
you know we can actually study it now in

713
00:31:32,289 --> 00:31:39,460
with labs and you know universities but

714
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:42,900
just the mycorrhizal discipline and in

715
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:47,019
general has a long way to go

716
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:51,429
so like I said inoculum single species

717
00:31:47,019 --> 00:31:53,799
inoculum is fantastic for plants you

718
00:31:51,429 --> 00:31:57,640
know as a principal I think diversity is

719
00:31:53,799 --> 00:32:00,549
is a good good way to go but we have a

720
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:03,309
lot to learn in terms of how that how

721
00:32:00,549 --> 00:32:04,299
that functions in a root system sure I

722
00:32:03,308 --> 00:32:05,519
would totally agree with that and

723
00:32:04,299 --> 00:32:08,889
there's a lot of challenges around

724
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:11,200
organics and research we were talking

725
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:13,150
about this I think last podcast but I

726
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,460
know definitely off air I was talking

727
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:17,470
with a friend about this how a lot of

728
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:18,789
the research being done it's very hard

729
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:21,160
to do it with our ganks because there's

730
00:32:18,789 --> 00:32:22,599
so many variables and there's so much we

731
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:24,700
don't know about the microbial

732
00:32:22,599 --> 00:32:27,189
interactions in the rhizosphere that

733
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:32,830
it's very hard to isolate and make any

734
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:34,630
definitive claims or evidence of claims

735
00:32:32,829 --> 00:32:36,129
moving forward based on what we're what

736
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:37,720
we're seeing because there are so many

737
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:40,240
things going on there's a relationships

738
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:41,500
between you know different microbes as

739
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,750
relations between the plant and the

740
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:46,299
microbes and it's it's really hard to

741
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:49,839
isolate down to the effect of one one

742
00:32:46,299 --> 00:32:51,730
particular variable but that kind of

743
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:54,240
brought me to another question here so

744
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:56,710
one of the challenges as a consumer is

745
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,539
there's so many different micro Raizel

746
00:32:56,710 --> 00:33:00,730
products on the market how do we

747
00:32:58,539 --> 00:33:03,519
evaluate them and we talked just now you

748
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:06,429
explained your your opinion on diversity

749
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:08,980
versus single species which which made a

750
00:33:06,429 --> 00:33:10,540
lot of sense but how do we you know how

751
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:11,950
do we evaluate these because there's

752
00:33:10,539 --> 00:33:13,480
there's a few different things I want to

753
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:15,460
look at here so we already talked about

754
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:16,720
endo versus ecto so if we're if we're

755
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:18,220
applying it to fruit trees if we're

756
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,600
applying it to our garden we want to

757
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:20,500
make sure we have endo mycorrhizal

758
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:23,709
fungus

759
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:25,058
mix and that echo is probably it's not

760
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:27,880
gonna hurt anything but it's not

761
00:33:25,058 --> 00:33:29,440
necessarily what we're looking for for

762
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:32,200
that inoculation so we want to make sure

763
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,610
we're comparing endo species and then we

764
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:35,409
need to look at do we have a single

765
00:33:33,609 --> 00:33:38,849
species versus a diversity of species

766
00:33:35,409 --> 00:33:41,230
and then finally the the concentrations

767
00:33:38,849 --> 00:33:43,029
which and this is something we should

768
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:45,400
probably go over to talking about how

769
00:33:43,029 --> 00:33:49,029
labeling works with propagules versus

770
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:50,919
spores and what's most viable for for

771
00:33:49,029 --> 00:33:52,149
consumers when they're applying these

772
00:33:50,919 --> 00:33:53,380
things because you see guys and they'll

773
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:56,320
look at a label and they say oh my gosh

774
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:58,150
this has 2 million proper gills per gram

775
00:33:56,319 --> 00:34:01,450
but when you break it out it's actually

776
00:33:58,150 --> 00:34:03,490
maybe 250 proper gills per gram of the

777
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:06,700
actual species that could potentially

778
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:08,289
infect or you know benefit the plant

779
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:09,579
that they're growing so can you just

780
00:34:08,289 --> 00:34:10,809
kind of maybe go over some of those

781
00:34:09,579 --> 00:34:13,418
things in a little more detail and

782
00:34:10,809 --> 00:34:17,590
explain your thoughts on that yeah

783
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:20,878
fantastic question so hmm how I think of

784
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:23,980
it is this is gonna sound funny but

785
00:34:20,878 --> 00:34:27,909
we're exiting the age of the wild west

786
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:30,969
microbial inoculant and what I mean by

787
00:34:27,909 --> 00:34:32,919
that is you know we've had companies and

788
00:34:30,969 --> 00:34:36,329
products just claiming the most

789
00:34:32,918 --> 00:34:40,179
outrageous stuff I won't name names but

790
00:34:36,329 --> 00:34:42,369
those products are somewhat gone from

791
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:45,700
the market you know the super outrageous

792
00:34:42,369 --> 00:34:50,470
ones are gone but the reputation of the

793
00:34:45,699 --> 00:34:52,210
company the the age of the company is is

794
00:34:50,469 --> 00:34:54,489
a big deal because this stuff is

795
00:34:52,210 --> 00:35:00,220
microscopic so you're you're essentially

796
00:34:54,489 --> 00:35:02,348
buying a car that's you know under a you

797
00:35:00,219 --> 00:35:03,459
know under a blanket or something like

798
00:35:02,349 --> 00:35:05,289
that you're not allowed to look at the

799
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:08,679
car you're not allowed to inspect the

800
00:35:05,289 --> 00:35:11,829
car to see the you know the integrity of

801
00:35:08,679 --> 00:35:14,259
the engine of the wheels or anything

802
00:35:11,829 --> 00:35:17,348
like that so this stuff is microscopic

803
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:20,460
so you know the company's reputation in

804
00:35:17,349 --> 00:35:23,109
the industry makes a big difference and

805
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:24,579
the first thing so you know when you go

806
00:35:23,108 --> 00:35:25,900
and take a look at these inoculum yeah

807
00:35:24,579 --> 00:35:27,969
the first thing you want to do is flip

808
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:29,680
it over and start with what they're

809
00:35:27,969 --> 00:35:32,230
claiming you know we'll get into that

810
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:33,839
whether or not that's reliable in a

811
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:35,639
minute but

812
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:37,860
start with what they're claiming so if

813
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:41,639
you're looking at you know apples for

814
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:44,970
apples so you know you're looking for

815
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:47,309
endo look at the diversity and then look

816
00:35:44,969 --> 00:35:49,709
at this the propagules it'll either say

817
00:35:47,309 --> 00:35:54,179
propagules or grams or proper gills or

818
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:57,720
spores per gram and that's a good that's

819
00:35:54,179 --> 00:36:03,690
a good indicator of how many I guess

820
00:35:57,719 --> 00:36:05,309
units of material are in that that will

821
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:08,400
actually germinate and create this

822
00:36:05,309 --> 00:36:11,099
mycorrhizal Network and so what proper

823
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:14,190
gills and spores is is that the spores

824
00:36:11,099 --> 00:36:17,730
are the it's like this seed of the apple

825
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:19,590
right so you can grow this fungus with a

826
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:23,519
spore because it has the genetic

827
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:25,019
material just like a seed and the term

828
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:28,949
prop akyuu laz we're talking about

829
00:36:25,019 --> 00:36:31,559
earlier it would be easier with fruiting

830
00:36:28,949 --> 00:36:33,239
bodies and mushrooms who produce much

831
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:35,250
more even spore material they're

832
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:37,889
actually spores but with the endo mica

833
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:39,300
rise because they're underground so

834
00:36:37,889 --> 00:36:41,129
think of that how that functions in an

835
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:45,360
ecosystem right you have plants that die

836
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:47,099
that their root system is where these

837
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:48,930
spores were formed and where these

838
00:36:47,099 --> 00:36:52,049
spores are going to pass on that genetic

839
00:36:48,929 --> 00:36:54,000
material so oftentimes the spores don't

840
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:55,980
have the advantage of you know hanging

841
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,989
from a cap as a gill would in a mushroom

842
00:36:55,980 --> 00:37:00,179
and it can be blown around by the wind

843
00:36:57,989 --> 00:37:02,429
or it could be knocked by an animal or

844
00:37:00,179 --> 00:37:04,259
oftentimes squirrels are really

845
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:07,469
important especially for truffles with

846
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:09,930
distribution of these organisms you

847
00:37:07,469 --> 00:37:11,789
don't have these these mechanical means

848
00:37:09,929 --> 00:37:14,429
of moving these spores around the forest

849
00:37:11,789 --> 00:37:16,230
so oftentimes the spores end up in the

850
00:37:14,429 --> 00:37:18,960
roots themselves and the plants just die

851
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:20,670
and that slowly decomposes but that root

852
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,590
is actually still viable because it's

853
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:24,000
it's either filled with spores or it's

854
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:26,460
just a fragment that will actually

855
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,440
germinate into when the next plant root

856
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:30,030
finds its way down there sends out those

857
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:32,849
chemical messengers we're talking about

858
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:35,190
earlier then that can germinate so we're

859
00:37:32,849 --> 00:37:37,110
talking about production of endo mike

860
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:40,289
rizzo fungi you're going to end up with

861
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:46,110
both root fragments and spores and

862
00:37:40,289 --> 00:37:46,800
they're both viable and you know it's

863
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:49,380
you

864
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:51,300
there is a process that you can just

865
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:55,380
kind of extrapolate the spores but it's

866
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:57,030
very expensive at this point so when

867
00:37:55,380 --> 00:38:00,860
people claim oh we've got this and that

868
00:37:57,030 --> 00:38:02,790
no billion spores program it's it's not

869
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:05,220
accurate if they're gonna have any price

870
00:38:02,789 --> 00:38:08,730
that's somewhat competitive in the

871
00:38:05,219 --> 00:38:10,529
marketplace at this point it's that's

872
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:14,909
they probably don't understand their

873
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:16,530
product because they show their but yeah

874
00:38:14,909 --> 00:38:17,480
so usually it's going to say proper

875
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:20,760
yields that's a more accurate

876
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:24,480
description of the material that's on

877
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:25,800
the market right now and yeah like I

878
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,619
said you want to look at the

879
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:33,269
concentration so you know two or three

880
00:38:28,619 --> 00:38:35,579
hundred prompt joules per gram is it's

881
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:39,690
very very hot it's very very high at

882
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:42,989
this point that's a real concentrate you

883
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:44,550
know around a hundred is is a good is

884
00:38:42,989 --> 00:38:46,500
not bad that's kind of what our lawn and

885
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:48,210
garden mixes are just because you know

886
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:51,780
the average person buying a rose or a

887
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:54,659
tomato plant is not going to go for the

888
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:56,700
higher prices you know because when you

889
00:38:54,659 --> 00:38:58,799
add those concentrations the price goes

890
00:38:56,699 --> 00:39:01,079
up so you know we could sell you a four

891
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,370
ounces of material for seven thousand

892
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:03,509
dollars or something like that because

893
00:39:02,369 --> 00:39:07,710
you can get these things really

894
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:10,110
concentrate but so you know what you're

895
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:13,710
looking for is good two to three hundred

896
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:14,490
coffee you'll program material are

897
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:16,500
liquid

898
00:39:14,489 --> 00:39:17,969
however with milliliters it's a little

899
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:21,539
different it's a little different volume

900
00:39:17,969 --> 00:39:25,819
so we're close to I think like sixty to

901
00:39:21,539 --> 00:39:29,130
eighty property goals per milliliter and

902
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:34,890
how that works out is is like you know

903
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:37,410
it's the same rate or the same cost per

904
00:39:34,889 --> 00:39:38,849
plant to use even though the the numbers

905
00:39:37,409 --> 00:39:40,289
are different the way that the volume

906
00:39:38,849 --> 00:39:41,639
works out it's the same you know if you

907
00:39:40,289 --> 00:39:42,960
were going to treat a four-inch plan it

908
00:39:41,639 --> 00:39:46,019
would cost the same with our liquid as

909
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:50,030
it would with the great white or you

910
00:39:46,019 --> 00:39:52,110
know our powder products and then you

911
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:55,800
can go with the straight mycorrhizal

912
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:57,990
inoculum we have products like that a

913
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:59,430
little bit of our products like I said

914
00:39:57,989 --> 00:40:00,809
we pride ourselves on diversity also

915
00:39:59,429 --> 00:40:03,269
carry

916
00:40:00,809 --> 00:40:05,519
specific bacteria that have been

917
00:40:03,269 --> 00:40:08,880
well-documented documented and studied

918
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:11,659
to provide things for plants so for

919
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:16,710
example nitrogen fixation or phosphorus

920
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:18,899
solubilization enzyme production so all

921
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:20,760
these things that that work hand-in-hand

922
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:24,180
with the mycorrhizae fungi and all the

923
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:26,790
other soil organisms for that matter but

924
00:40:24,179 --> 00:40:29,669
these secondary metabolites azar codes

925
00:40:26,789 --> 00:40:31,980
from the bacteria are super functional

926
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:34,760
and helpful for plants and my garage

927
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:37,619
will fungi so if the inoculants have

928
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:40,770
beneficial soil bacteria in there we've

929
00:40:37,619 --> 00:40:43,849
found that the synergistic effect of my

930
00:40:40,769 --> 00:40:48,869
grass with fungi combined with these

931
00:40:43,849 --> 00:40:54,690
bacterial concentrates is this shows

932
00:40:48,869 --> 00:40:59,420
better yield or better results versus

933
00:40:54,690 --> 00:41:02,880
just using one of those individually

934
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:05,659
okay so essentially as a consumer what

935
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:08,490
you want to look at is the

936
00:41:05,659 --> 00:41:10,559
concentrations which will most likely be

937
00:41:08,489 --> 00:41:12,509
expressed in property goals per gram of

938
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:15,690
the particular species which we're

939
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:18,870
looking for or type of micro zone which

940
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:21,720
would be endo and then beyond that

941
00:41:18,869 --> 00:41:23,099
diversity like you said and then lastly

942
00:41:21,719 --> 00:41:25,739
one of the things that you touched on

943
00:41:23,099 --> 00:41:28,380
there that I want to I want to examine a

944
00:41:25,739 --> 00:41:31,009
little closer is that there's no one

945
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:33,869
really doing researcher or testing of

946
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:37,500
people's claims as I understand it I

947
00:41:33,869 --> 00:41:39,000
know with soil like I had to have when I

948
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:42,389
registered my product I had to make a

949
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:44,429
guaranteed analysis claim if I'm if it's

950
00:41:42,389 --> 00:41:46,079
gonna be registered as a fertilizer and

951
00:41:44,429 --> 00:41:47,789
then whatever that claim is I have to

952
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:51,150
show a lab test supporting that but then

953
00:41:47,789 --> 00:41:53,489
at that point it's the state would have

954
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:54,750
to would be randomly testing the product

955
00:41:53,489 --> 00:41:57,329
maybe pulling it off the shelf

956
00:41:54,750 --> 00:42:00,179
to see if it actually met those

957
00:41:57,329 --> 00:42:02,880
standards down the road in terms of in

958
00:42:00,179 --> 00:42:04,679
the actual bags themselves so I assume

959
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:07,200
it's the same on the microbial side like

960
00:42:04,679 --> 00:42:08,819
you if you had one test for example that

961
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:10,589
said you had a thousand proper girls per

962
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:12,750
gram you could put that on the label and

963
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:14,019
then in theory until the state or

964
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:16,750
whoever registered

965
00:42:14,019 --> 00:42:19,480
he tested it no one would ever know what

966
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:21,460
was actually in that product am I am I

967
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:22,570
saying this correctly I feel like I know

968
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:24,010
there's been some tests done by the

969
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:26,440
Oregon Department of Agriculture that

970
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:29,260
have shown mycorrhizal levels and other

971
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:30,730
microbial levels from 2016 has being

972
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:32,950
very different than the claims that were

973
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:36,809
on the label can you touch on that at

974
00:42:32,949 --> 00:42:39,779
all or is that too tricky of a subject

975
00:42:36,809 --> 00:42:42,219
no absolutely and that's you know that's

976
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:45,519
we're actually really happy that that's

977
00:42:42,219 --> 00:42:48,459
happening because like I said you know

978
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:51,670
that gives companies like us who have

979
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:55,150
been you know honest and you know

980
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:55,840
actually putting in what we claim a huge

981
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:58,630
advantage

982
00:42:55,840 --> 00:43:02,350
so yeah Oregon is beginning to test

983
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:03,400
microbial products and you know they're

984
00:43:02,349 --> 00:43:07,989
not perfect

985
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:11,590
I think they we actually my family's

986
00:43:07,989 --> 00:43:13,209
company sort of help them develop some

987
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:16,570
of the tests for the microwaves will

988
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:21,220
fungi in terms I mean this is you know

989
00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:23,140
10 15 years ago so you know microwaves

990
00:43:21,219 --> 00:43:24,609
with fungi are much different than

991
00:43:23,139 --> 00:43:28,929
bacteria and they were sort of treating

992
00:43:24,610 --> 00:43:30,820
them like bacteria and so yeah the

993
00:43:28,929 --> 00:43:32,259
testing is beginning to happen and

994
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:33,580
that's kind of why I said we're coming

995
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:35,260
out of the age of the wild wild west

996
00:43:33,579 --> 00:43:37,150
because there were some products out

997
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:41,170
there that just made outrageous claims

998
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:44,950
and that's going to this testing is

999
00:43:41,170 --> 00:43:47,079
going to consolidate and kind of weed

1000
00:43:44,949 --> 00:43:49,569
out some of those companies and products

1001
00:43:47,079 --> 00:43:50,619
who are playing you know who aren't

1002
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:53,950
being truthful

1003
00:43:50,619 --> 00:43:57,159
so yeah that's absolutely accurate like

1004
00:43:53,949 --> 00:43:59,259
you said no people can put whatever they

1005
00:43:57,159 --> 00:44:01,690
want on we're responsible for a

1006
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:05,080
guaranteed analysis and analysis in

1007
00:44:01,690 --> 00:44:07,450
terms of NPK and you know derived from

1008
00:44:05,079 --> 00:44:11,920
statements but with the microbials it's

1009
00:44:07,449 --> 00:44:14,949
kind of been this gray area and organs

1010
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:17,170
kind of leading the pack but a lot of

1011
00:44:14,949 --> 00:44:20,349
other states will probably add a doc

1012
00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:24,700
some of the testing methodologies and

1013
00:44:20,349 --> 00:44:26,019
and the regulatory piece of that so it's

1014
00:44:24,699 --> 00:44:27,429
actually it's a good thing for consumers

1015
00:44:26,019 --> 00:44:29,800
and

1016
00:44:27,429 --> 00:44:32,858
what we do this is kind of how it works

1017
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:35,530
on the on the microbe side is so we'll

1018
00:44:32,858 --> 00:44:37,659
actually you know we'll formulate things

1019
00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:40,480
to concentrations that we think are

1020
00:44:37,659 --> 00:44:42,279
adequate for you know the type of grower

1021
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:43,960
that we're making the product for and

1022
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:46,240
then we'll actually get it tested by an

1023
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:49,300
independent lab and they will verify

1024
00:44:46,239 --> 00:44:51,429
what we've been doing and aiming for and

1025
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:53,318
then we'll reduce it by about twenty to

1026
00:44:51,429 --> 00:44:55,750
twenty five percent when we when we

1027
00:44:53,318 --> 00:44:57,880
claim it on the back of the bag to give

1028
00:44:55,750 --> 00:45:00,818
a window so that when they do because

1029
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:02,559
they'll the the regulator's will go

1030
00:45:00,818 --> 00:45:05,230
through and as you know just pull you

1031
00:45:02,559 --> 00:45:07,780
know product off the shelf at any you

1032
00:45:05,230 --> 00:45:11,710
know any licensed retailer and test it

1033
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:14,019
and so you know we we actually allow we

1034
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:16,000
we met we claimed less than we know is

1035
00:45:14,019 --> 00:45:18,369
in the bag for the odd batch that

1036
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:21,010
doesn't have you know didn't get mixed

1037
00:45:18,369 --> 00:45:23,920
perfectly or whatever so we actually

1038
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:26,829
claimed a lot less than what's in the

1039
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:28,659
what's in there that we we aim for

1040
00:45:26,829 --> 00:45:30,700
and there's fertilizers the same people

1041
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:32,588
do the same thing with fertilizer but

1042
00:45:30,699 --> 00:45:34,328
that that's kind of the the state of the

1043
00:45:32,588 --> 00:45:36,699
testing and it's it's a really good

1044
00:45:34,329 --> 00:45:38,230
thing for consumers because these you

1045
00:45:36,699 --> 00:45:41,289
know microbials like I said are

1046
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:45,429
invisible so you know people could claim

1047
00:45:41,289 --> 00:45:47,460
anything and it would never be tested so

1048
00:45:45,429 --> 00:45:49,449
the best thing for people to do is to

1049
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:50,588
take a look at a label trying to

1050
00:45:49,449 --> 00:45:53,169
understand it to the best of their

1051
00:45:50,588 --> 00:45:55,179
ability do their own research and then

1052
00:45:53,170 --> 00:45:59,139
really just see look at plant response

1053
00:45:55,179 --> 00:46:01,598
so I think you know use great white use

1054
00:45:59,139 --> 00:46:02,949
some of these other brands and and you

1055
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:04,510
know see what kind of results you get

1056
00:46:02,949 --> 00:46:06,989
and that's ultimately what we're looking

1057
00:46:04,510 --> 00:46:08,559
for anyway I think is plant response so

1058
00:46:06,989 --> 00:46:10,239
absolutely yeah

1059
00:46:08,559 --> 00:46:12,309
be in touch with your garden and that's

1060
00:46:10,239 --> 00:46:15,848
that's really why we've been successful

1061
00:46:12,309 --> 00:46:17,619
as a company because people do these

1062
00:46:15,849 --> 00:46:20,079
side by sides you know I can't tell you

1063
00:46:17,619 --> 00:46:24,430
how many times I go to a new nursery or

1064
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:27,579
you know or we hand out a sample at a

1065
00:46:24,429 --> 00:46:29,348
trade show and we'll get pictures back

1066
00:46:27,579 --> 00:46:31,510
like wow look at the difference in the

1067
00:46:29,349 --> 00:46:34,289
root system you know because this is

1068
00:46:31,510 --> 00:46:36,910
this is an ancient relationship this is

1069
00:46:34,289 --> 00:46:39,940
plants depend on this it's like it's

1070
00:46:36,909 --> 00:46:40,899
like going through and bleaching the you

1071
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:42,639
know the inside of

1072
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:45,250
human-being you'd only last about a week

1073
00:46:42,639 --> 00:46:47,440
or two so it's almost how we've been

1074
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:49,510
treating plants as we just destroy the

1075
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:53,289
biosphere and expect these plants to

1076
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:55,000
perform you know at a high level but

1077
00:46:53,289 --> 00:46:57,880
then we end up okay well now we need

1078
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:59,559
like 90 percent extra fertilizers

1079
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:01,420
because most of us getting locked up in

1080
00:46:59,559 --> 00:47:03,880
the plant roots can't release the

1081
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:05,829
exudates to get it unlocked or we hit

1082
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:07,570
them with fungicides or pesticides

1083
00:47:05,829 --> 00:47:10,059
because now their immune systems are

1084
00:47:07,570 --> 00:47:12,100
compromised like it's a no-brainer these

1085
00:47:10,059 --> 00:47:14,619
microbes work like my gradual fungi

1086
00:47:12,099 --> 00:47:17,889
works it's it's a relationship that's

1087
00:47:14,619 --> 00:47:22,690
like I said there's oldest land plants

1088
00:47:17,889 --> 00:47:24,489
so yeah use the stuff and see you know

1089
00:47:22,690 --> 00:47:26,289
see it for yourself and until you

1090
00:47:24,489 --> 00:47:29,079
actually try something and see it it's

1091
00:47:26,289 --> 00:47:31,360
all hearsay anyway so don't they doesn't

1092
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:34,779
think what I'm saying is is you know the

1093
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:36,720
truth try it out for yourself great now

1094
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:39,070
I want to talk about some of the other

1095
00:47:36,719 --> 00:47:41,619
bacteria and other ingredients in great

1096
00:47:39,070 --> 00:47:44,470
white but before we do can we talk a

1097
00:47:41,619 --> 00:47:47,469
little bit about best practice so how

1098
00:47:44,469 --> 00:47:50,619
what is best practice around application

1099
00:47:47,469 --> 00:47:52,449
of these microbial products because one

1100
00:47:50,619 --> 00:47:53,679
thing I want to touch on kids we were

1101
00:47:52,449 --> 00:47:56,409
just talking about labeling now that I'm

1102
00:47:53,679 --> 00:47:58,210
thinking of it is I see you'll get a

1103
00:47:56,409 --> 00:47:59,859
soil bag or a bag of fertilizer and

1104
00:47:58,210 --> 00:48:01,059
they'll say with mycorrhizae on there

1105
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:03,510
and then you go and look on the back and

1106
00:48:01,059 --> 00:48:05,529
it's like point zero zero eight

1107
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:08,290
propagules per gram or something like

1108
00:48:05,530 --> 00:48:09,850
just a really really small number and I

1109
00:48:08,289 --> 00:48:11,170
typically tell people that that's

1110
00:48:09,849 --> 00:48:14,909
probably not enough for them to get

1111
00:48:11,170 --> 00:48:17,650
mycorrhizal infection they're better off

1112
00:48:14,909 --> 00:48:19,359
applying it directly to the roots of

1113
00:48:17,650 --> 00:48:21,190
their plant rather than applying it you

1114
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:22,840
know homogeneously throughout the soil

1115
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:25,300
or trying to get it with fertilizer and

1116
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:26,740
as I understand it because it is a spore

1117
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:28,810
a proper goo it also doesn't move

1118
00:48:26,739 --> 00:48:30,609
through the soil very effectively it

1119
00:48:28,809 --> 00:48:32,289
needs a physical mechanism of watering

1120
00:48:30,610 --> 00:48:34,809
or something like that so we want to

1121
00:48:32,289 --> 00:48:36,759
apply it directly to the roots but can

1122
00:48:34,809 --> 00:48:39,639
you give what your pointers would be for

1123
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:41,470
people who want to use you know a

1124
00:48:39,639 --> 00:48:47,170
mycorrhizal product whether with their

1125
00:48:41,469 --> 00:48:51,299
plants absolutely so yeah direct contact

1126
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:54,409
is essential the plant root releases a

1127
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:56,750
chemical I'm forgetting the name that

1128
00:48:54,409 --> 00:48:59,899
triggers the spore to send out a Hisle

1129
00:48:56,750 --> 00:49:02,389
tip which then plugs into the plant

1130
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:05,088
itself so that physical contact is

1131
00:49:02,389 --> 00:49:07,429
crucial when you have microbes that are

1132
00:49:05,088 --> 00:49:09,920
dispersed you know a foot away three

1133
00:49:07,429 --> 00:49:11,808
feet away from the plants if you're

1134
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:14,210
doing it short you know short seems an

1135
00:49:11,809 --> 00:49:16,099
annual crop most likely it's not going

1136
00:49:14,210 --> 00:49:17,750
to germinate until you know late in the

1137
00:49:16,099 --> 00:49:19,640
season and by that time that really is

1138
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:21,469
not benefiting the plant so you got to

1139
00:49:19,639 --> 00:49:22,818
think of all those spores as investments

1140
00:49:21,469 --> 00:49:25,308
you know you spent money to get those

1141
00:49:22,818 --> 00:49:27,349
into your soil the best way to use them

1142
00:49:25,309 --> 00:49:30,440
is to get it right on the plant root so

1143
00:49:27,349 --> 00:49:32,809
we have powders that you can sprinkle

1144
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:35,179
right on the roots themselves you can

1145
00:49:32,809 --> 00:49:37,490
also dissolve those powders in water and

1146
00:49:35,179 --> 00:49:39,348
water it in you can send it through your

1147
00:49:37,489 --> 00:49:42,618
fertigation system put it in your

1148
00:49:39,349 --> 00:49:45,289
reservoir you know have it drip down in

1149
00:49:42,619 --> 00:49:46,818
there so any way for it to actually make

1150
00:49:45,289 --> 00:49:49,490
contact with the root system is

1151
00:49:46,818 --> 00:49:50,960
beneficial we also have granular

1152
00:49:49,489 --> 00:49:52,699
products that were designed not to be

1153
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:54,679
dissolved in water just to be sprinkled

1154
00:49:52,699 --> 00:49:59,118
and sprinkled into the hole at

1155
00:49:54,679 --> 00:50:01,250
transplant time so that's really the

1156
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:03,650
most cost effective way to inoculate

1157
00:50:01,250 --> 00:50:07,818
your plants and to talk about bagged

1158
00:50:03,650 --> 00:50:09,950
soils and fertilizers yeah I think it's

1159
00:50:07,818 --> 00:50:13,099
a good thing that people are paying

1160
00:50:09,949 --> 00:50:15,939
attention to and and soil companies

1161
00:50:13,099 --> 00:50:19,548
fertilizer companies are beginning to

1162
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:23,869
honor the soil microbes and include them

1163
00:50:19,548 --> 00:50:25,940
the problem with soil is that you know

1164
00:50:23,869 --> 00:50:28,880
like you said the concentrations are

1165
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:31,159
really really low so to see a good plant

1166
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:34,130
response for example our bare minimum

1167
00:50:31,159 --> 00:50:35,778
for a four-inch plan is about ten spores

1168
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:39,318
if you're talking about endo mycorrhizae

1169
00:50:35,778 --> 00:50:41,989
ten spores per plant so often times with

1170
00:50:39,318 --> 00:50:45,650
these you know bagged soils you'd have

1171
00:50:41,989 --> 00:50:47,328
to use a whole others there's just not

1172
00:50:45,650 --> 00:50:50,019
enough material in there to actually

1173
00:50:47,329 --> 00:50:53,269
make a real difference with the plant

1174
00:50:50,019 --> 00:50:56,538
besides that these bags are often stored

1175
00:50:53,269 --> 00:50:57,980
in direct Sun so if this bag sits on a

1176
00:50:56,539 --> 00:51:00,130
Sun for a day

1177
00:50:57,980 --> 00:51:02,568
most likely everything in there is dead

1178
00:51:00,130 --> 00:51:04,099
if something does happen to get in there

1179
00:51:02,568 --> 00:51:06,469
that you don't want what's you know so

1180
00:51:04,099 --> 00:51:08,140
once again I haven't even talked about

1181
00:51:06,469 --> 00:51:12,039
this with the concept of having

1182
00:51:08,139 --> 00:51:14,440
a sterile soil the problem with that is

1183
00:51:12,039 --> 00:51:17,380
that that is a ripe environment for an

1184
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:19,000
explosion of some sort of disease or

1185
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:22,269
something that you don't want in there

1186
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:24,699
so you don't one of the real ways that

1187
00:51:22,269 --> 00:51:27,639
these inoculum work is that they create

1188
00:51:24,699 --> 00:51:30,699
this balance they create sort of this

1189
00:51:27,639 --> 00:51:32,889
net that when something unwanted comes

1190
00:51:30,699 --> 00:51:36,250
in to the system it's immediately

1191
00:51:32,889 --> 00:51:38,079
out-compete it that's a huge one with my

1192
00:51:36,250 --> 00:51:40,329
guys will fungi is that there's not a

1193
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:44,440
lot of ambient nutrients or spaces for

1194
00:51:40,329 --> 00:51:46,420
disease to exist so that's that's a big

1195
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:49,750
one with the soils is that they often

1196
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:51,670
get sterilized in the Sun besides having

1197
00:51:49,750 --> 00:51:53,739
low concentrations and with the

1198
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:55,570
fertilizer it's generally the same thing

1199
00:51:53,739 --> 00:51:58,209
really really low concentrations it's

1200
00:51:55,570 --> 00:52:01,510
too expensive for them to really hit it

1201
00:51:58,210 --> 00:52:03,610
with a lot of sort of microbes so what

1202
00:52:01,510 --> 00:52:05,410
we recommend is buying straight

1203
00:52:03,610 --> 00:52:07,570
fertilizer buying us you know you're

1204
00:52:05,409 --> 00:52:10,929
straight soil and then adding the

1205
00:52:07,570 --> 00:52:13,990
biology when it makes it to your your

1206
00:52:10,929 --> 00:52:17,259
grow your site and you know another

1207
00:52:13,989 --> 00:52:19,689
reason is that we as a company pay a lot

1208
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:22,060
of attention to and spend a lot of time

1209
00:52:19,690 --> 00:52:24,670
and effort and maintaining an

1210
00:52:22,059 --> 00:52:27,369
environment and shipping our products

1211
00:52:24,670 --> 00:52:30,250
and educating the stores and the

1212
00:52:27,369 --> 00:52:32,019
retailers on how to store these products

1213
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:35,699
it's printed right on our bags the bags

1214
00:52:32,019 --> 00:52:39,429
are all designed as well as the jars for

1215
00:52:35,699 --> 00:52:42,069
sort of maximum stability of these

1216
00:52:39,429 --> 00:52:43,719
organisms so also in the like you know

1217
00:52:42,070 --> 00:52:45,550
the supply chain the delivery these

1218
00:52:43,719 --> 00:52:47,439
organisms are taken care of so that once

1219
00:52:45,550 --> 00:52:50,310
they make it to you they're in a prime

1220
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:53,409
condition to come out of dormancy and

1221
00:52:50,309 --> 00:52:56,429
colonize your soil in your root system

1222
00:52:53,409 --> 00:52:59,649
so yeah those are those are key points

1223
00:52:56,429 --> 00:53:02,500
so for a fast crop like cannabis for

1224
00:52:59,650 --> 00:53:05,139
example that may you know maybe 90 days

1225
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:08,760
for example or even less in a lot of

1226
00:53:05,139 --> 00:53:11,500
cases we want we want to get the

1227
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:14,110
mycorrhizal infection to occur as

1228
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:16,539
quickly as possible which means directly

1229
00:53:14,110 --> 00:53:19,780
onto the seeds or rooted clones when we

1230
00:53:16,539 --> 00:53:21,150
transplant how important it is it to

1231
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:22,769
reenact you late

1232
00:53:21,150 --> 00:53:25,200
when we transplant at later stages

1233
00:53:22,769 --> 00:53:28,619
because I've always been a big proponent

1234
00:53:25,199 --> 00:53:30,868
of doing a really heavy inoculation

1235
00:53:28,619 --> 00:53:32,250
right at right at the time of planting

1236
00:53:30,869 --> 00:53:34,920
saying you're rooted clone or your

1237
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:36,719
seedling and then not reapplying when I

1238
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:39,690
transplant it later stages just because

1239
00:53:36,719 --> 00:53:43,199
it gets so expensive relative to

1240
00:53:39,690 --> 00:53:46,019
potential benefit have you seen have you

1241
00:53:43,199 --> 00:53:48,179
seen benefit with later applications of

1242
00:53:46,019 --> 00:53:51,750
micro eyes'll fungus yet you know state

1243
00:53:48,179 --> 00:53:54,210
other stages of transplant with a pure

1244
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:56,849
mycorrhizal inoculum i would say that

1245
00:53:54,210 --> 00:53:59,760
what you're doing is fantastic maybe one

1246
00:53:56,849 --> 00:54:03,240
more application with our products they

1247
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:05,160
also contain huge diversity and really

1248
00:54:03,239 --> 00:54:10,139
high concentrations of the beneficial

1249
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:12,358
bacteria not talking about our products

1250
00:54:10,139 --> 00:54:15,088
but talking about BT Bacillus

1251
00:54:12,358 --> 00:54:18,750
thuringiensis which our products happens

1252
00:54:15,088 --> 00:54:22,949
to contain you know that's a bio

1253
00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:25,380
pesticide in the organic world so it's

1254
00:54:22,949 --> 00:54:27,058
almost so I think of these inoculants

1255
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:29,190
that contain the bacteria as well as the

1256
00:54:27,059 --> 00:54:30,900
mycorrhizae fungi is basically

1257
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:32,818
interesting compost teas so I'm always

1258
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:35,910
revolving sometimes I'll just use our

1259
00:54:32,818 --> 00:54:38,130
straight powders in water or sometimes

1260
00:54:35,909 --> 00:54:42,719
I'll brew compost tea with worm castings

1261
00:54:38,130 --> 00:54:46,318
or compost you know I'm constantly

1262
00:54:42,719 --> 00:54:47,759
adding teas and biology to my soil but

1263
00:54:46,318 --> 00:54:49,769
in terms of a straight mycorrhizal

1264
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:51,778
inoculum I think that one heavy

1265
00:54:49,769 --> 00:54:54,809
inoculation will give you a really good

1266
00:54:51,778 --> 00:54:57,539
colonization of your root system doing

1267
00:54:54,809 --> 00:55:01,769
it more you know it depends on the the

1268
00:54:57,539 --> 00:55:03,480
specific growing conditions but you know

1269
00:55:01,769 --> 00:55:06,059
people will have to try it for

1270
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:08,309
themselves there's a general rule with a

1271
00:55:06,059 --> 00:55:10,079
straight micro inoculum I don't think

1272
00:55:08,309 --> 00:55:12,569
you're really going to see a huge return

1273
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:15,180
on investment for a second in a a third

1274
00:55:12,568 --> 00:55:17,699
application but like I said our products

1275
00:55:15,179 --> 00:55:20,608
are a little more complex we have seen

1276
00:55:17,699 --> 00:55:24,659
people using it every feeding every

1277
00:55:20,608 --> 00:55:27,719
watering as a preventative so you know

1278
00:55:24,659 --> 00:55:29,639
whether that's broad acre or you're

1279
00:55:27,719 --> 00:55:31,649
growing in a very you know controlled

1280
00:55:29,639 --> 00:55:33,659
environment and growing indoor

1281
00:55:31,650 --> 00:55:34,889
you know every conditions different

1282
00:55:33,659 --> 00:55:36,719
you'll kind of have to

1283
00:55:34,889 --> 00:55:40,318
that's it for yourself and see if that

1284
00:55:36,719 --> 00:55:42,598
prevention is is necessary and worth it

1285
00:55:40,318 --> 00:55:44,518
for you or you know if you're getting

1286
00:55:42,599 --> 00:55:46,970
along just fine you don't need it but

1287
00:55:44,518 --> 00:55:49,679
it's essentially like taking a probiotic

1288
00:55:46,969 --> 00:55:51,449
you know so people take those ongoing

1289
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:53,129
and with the mycorrhizae really what

1290
00:55:51,449 --> 00:55:56,159
you're looking for is just to get around

1291
00:55:53,130 --> 00:55:57,329
you know 75 to 85 percent colonization

1292
00:55:56,159 --> 00:56:00,179
of the root system that's what you're

1293
00:55:57,329 --> 00:56:03,180
aiming for so ends on the success of the

1294
00:56:00,179 --> 00:56:04,588
first inoculation which you know it's

1295
00:56:03,179 --> 00:56:05,759
different every time but if you're doing

1296
00:56:04,588 --> 00:56:08,278
it like you said a really heavy

1297
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:11,730
inoculation right on the roots probably

1298
00:56:08,278 --> 00:56:14,400
getting a really heavy colonization now

1299
00:56:11,730 --> 00:56:16,289
how long does that time to infection

1300
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:19,740
occur or colonization as you're calling

1301
00:56:16,289 --> 00:56:23,339
it my understanding is it takes at least

1302
00:56:19,739 --> 00:56:24,118
10 to 14 days under good conditions or

1303
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:26,730
even longer

1304
00:56:24,119 --> 00:56:30,619
is that accurate or what are you finding

1305
00:56:26,730 --> 00:56:33,420
for infection rates yep that's accurate

1306
00:56:30,619 --> 00:56:35,068
we see the bacteria and our products go

1307
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:36,869
to work a little quicker so like the

1308
00:56:35,068 --> 00:56:41,909
Great White has glycine which is a

1309
00:56:36,869 --> 00:56:43,500
simple sugar b1 vitamin C and we see

1310
00:56:41,909 --> 00:56:45,568
people like oh my gosh my roots are

1311
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:48,838
going nuts like they're super white you

1312
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:51,509
know or it helps remediates something

1313
00:56:48,838 --> 00:56:53,969
that's gone awry generally that's the

1314
00:56:51,509 --> 00:56:55,380
bacteria and like the Trichoderma which

1315
00:56:53,969 --> 00:56:58,858
I think we'll probably talk about next

1316
00:56:55,380 --> 00:57:00,630
but those are heavy enzyme producers so

1317
00:56:58,858 --> 00:57:02,278
they're breaking down organic matter you

1318
00:57:00,630 --> 00:57:04,079
know you've got dead roots on there you

1319
00:57:02,278 --> 00:57:06,239
that are turning brown you've got slough

1320
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:08,130
da fruits you've got excess you know

1321
00:57:06,239 --> 00:57:15,118
organic matter in the root system those

1322
00:57:08,130 --> 00:57:17,329
bacteria are just really really heavy

1323
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:19,500
like I said enzyme producers

1324
00:57:17,329 --> 00:57:21,509
micronutrient soluble Iser so they're

1325
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:23,670
really going to work and just cleaning

1326
00:57:21,509 --> 00:57:25,949
up that whole root system so yeah

1327
00:57:23,670 --> 00:57:29,608
generally my kraslow colonization takes

1328
00:57:25,949 --> 00:57:33,750
just under two weeks and the bacteria

1329
00:57:29,608 --> 00:57:37,139
sort of peaked and then the root system

1330
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:39,059
returns to a tortoise kind of a steady

1331
00:57:37,139 --> 00:57:40,920
state based on the exudates and the

1332
00:57:39,059 --> 00:57:43,619
sugars released by the root system

1333
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:45,539
itself so bacterial peak and then my

1334
00:57:43,619 --> 00:57:48,269
gradual colonization takes about ten to

1335
00:57:45,539 --> 00:57:48,720
fourteen days like you said okay I do

1336
00:57:48,268 --> 00:57:50,578
want to

1337
00:57:48,719 --> 00:57:52,828
and talk about the bacteria but I had a

1338
00:57:50,579 --> 00:57:55,890
couple more questions before we do so

1339
00:57:52,829 --> 00:57:59,160
yeah one of the questions is the

1340
00:57:55,889 --> 00:58:01,019
persistence of these mycorrhizal

1341
00:57:59,159 --> 00:58:03,059
property goals are spores in the soil

1342
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:06,719
like for example if someone was running

1343
00:58:03,059 --> 00:58:09,059
a living soil indoors or even this let's

1344
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:11,789
say soil in their greenhouse or outdoors

1345
00:58:09,059 --> 00:58:13,980
they you know they pull the plant or

1346
00:58:11,789 --> 00:58:15,929
even just cut the plant at the stock and

1347
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:16,650
let those roots break down right there

1348
00:58:15,929 --> 00:58:19,879
in the soil

1349
00:58:16,650 --> 00:58:23,088
what is the persistence of that

1350
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:25,470
mycorrhizal those mycorrhizal spores and

1351
00:58:23,088 --> 00:58:28,139
do we need to reenact you late every

1352
00:58:25,469 --> 00:58:32,969
cycle in say a living soil bed or in

1353
00:58:28,139 --> 00:58:35,818
soil that we're reusing yeah so you know

1354
00:58:32,969 --> 00:58:39,379
what I generally tell people I haven't

1355
00:58:35,818 --> 00:58:42,630
seen a ton of studies on carryover of

1356
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:45,720
roots and to you know season after

1357
00:58:42,630 --> 00:58:48,030
season you know I guess it's fair to

1358
00:58:45,719 --> 00:58:52,799
assume if it's the same species you will

1359
00:58:48,030 --> 00:58:56,339
have some carryover I don't know so like

1360
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:59,329
a lot of these spores for a lot of these

1361
00:58:56,338 --> 00:59:01,619
end oh my car is old root systems don't

1362
00:58:59,329 --> 00:59:03,269
well you know some of them take it

1363
00:59:01,619 --> 00:59:05,880
depends on the species I mean it depends

1364
00:59:03,269 --> 00:59:08,670
on the growing condition so some of them

1365
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:11,430
can take 3 years to produce spores some

1366
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:15,210
of them can take you know six months

1367
00:59:11,429 --> 00:59:19,710
seven months like one growing season but

1368
00:59:15,210 --> 00:59:23,068
I'm not an expert in that you know it's

1369
00:59:19,710 --> 00:59:25,318
plausible that the the roots of you know

1370
00:59:23,068 --> 00:59:26,969
will stay along long stay alive long

1371
00:59:25,318 --> 00:59:29,550
enough from where the mycelium will stay

1372
00:59:26,969 --> 00:59:33,179
a long life a lot alive long enough to

1373
00:59:29,550 --> 00:59:34,619
colonize the next crop but I don't think

1374
00:59:33,179 --> 00:59:37,559
there's a whole lot of research done on

1375
00:59:34,619 --> 00:59:39,470
that so I wouldn't really be confident

1376
00:59:37,559 --> 00:59:42,630
or comfortable making a recommendation

1377
00:59:39,469 --> 00:59:46,679
you know with the cost of inoculation

1378
00:59:42,630 --> 00:59:48,510
and the business that we're in it's a

1379
00:59:46,679 --> 00:59:51,389
no-brainer for me you know it's like if

1380
00:59:48,510 --> 00:59:53,700
you're gonna buy some fish and and some

1381
00:59:51,389 --> 00:59:57,980
kelp which and rock dust which I

1382
00:59:53,699 --> 01:00:00,689
advocate you do you know why not buy

1383
00:59:57,980 --> 01:00:02,039
twenty dollars of material or to treat

1384
01:00:00,690 --> 01:00:05,159
your whole

1385
01:00:02,039 --> 01:00:07,739
crop with my kreizel fungi I mean you

1386
01:00:05,159 --> 01:00:11,849
you don't have to use this stuff like a

1387
01:00:07,739 --> 01:00:15,089
you know like a flower you you know like

1388
01:00:11,849 --> 01:00:16,559
a like a pizza dough or something like

1389
01:00:15,090 --> 01:00:18,210
that you don't have to throw a ton of

1390
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:19,769
this stuff at it you can actually you

1391
01:00:18,210 --> 01:00:21,269
know dilute it and use it at the

1392
01:00:19,769 --> 01:00:23,759
recommended rates as well which will

1393
01:00:21,269 --> 01:00:26,099
make it go a lot further I'd actually

1394
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:27,960
recommend that over using a ton and then

1395
01:00:26,099 --> 01:00:31,049
hoping it carries over from season to

1396
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:33,480
season because of the benefits of using

1397
01:00:31,050 --> 01:00:35,400
it on a new seedling for for stress and

1398
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:37,980
transplant and all the things that we've

1399
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:40,619
talked about but yeah in terms of

1400
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:44,940
carryover I'd like to see some studies

1401
01:00:40,619 --> 01:00:47,250
but I haven't seen any well I guess I'm

1402
01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:49,079
wondering is if that if for example we

1403
01:00:47,250 --> 01:00:51,659
had let's just take a 4x8 raised bed

1404
01:00:49,079 --> 01:00:53,670
just to simplify things and we had a

1405
01:00:51,659 --> 01:00:56,849
plant a cannabis plant growing in there

1406
01:00:53,670 --> 01:00:58,710
and that plant we go to harvest that

1407
01:00:56,849 --> 01:01:01,049
plant and let's say we take out the

1408
01:00:58,710 --> 01:01:02,579
roots you know or the the main roots but

1409
01:01:01,050 --> 01:01:04,170
don't worry about so there's gonna be

1410
01:01:02,579 --> 01:01:06,809
root there's gonna be a bunch of root

1411
01:01:04,170 --> 01:01:10,019
hairs and leftover root material in that

1412
01:01:06,809 --> 01:01:12,599
soil if we were to plant say a cover

1413
01:01:10,019 --> 01:01:16,050
crop or our next cycle of cannabis

1414
01:01:12,599 --> 01:01:19,319
plants would the microcell fungus that

1415
01:01:16,050 --> 01:01:23,369
had infected the crop before potentially

1416
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:27,030
infect the new crop yeah it's definitely

1417
01:01:23,369 --> 01:01:29,160
uh potentially but you know it all

1418
01:01:27,030 --> 01:01:31,410
depends on what species colonized the

1419
01:01:29,159 --> 01:01:32,759
cannabis and what species of cover crop

1420
01:01:31,409 --> 01:01:37,710
you're planting and whether or not the

1421
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:39,240
two are compatible it depends on the

1422
01:01:37,710 --> 01:01:40,949
length of time between the two you know

1423
01:01:39,239 --> 01:01:42,599
if it's a day or two yeah it's

1424
01:01:40,949 --> 01:01:45,358
definitely reasonable and plausible one

1425
01:01:42,599 --> 01:01:48,179
I totally support that I just I just

1426
01:01:45,358 --> 01:01:49,889
don't know okay no that's fine I was

1427
01:01:48,179 --> 01:01:52,289
just curious if you knew the answer yeah

1428
01:01:49,889 --> 01:01:53,879
no I mean I love it I come from the

1429
01:01:52,289 --> 01:01:55,949
world of you know permaculture and

1430
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:59,340
sustainability and environmental science

1431
01:01:55,949 --> 01:02:02,250
so I'm all about the least amount of

1432
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:04,559
inputs and you know extraction and all

1433
01:02:02,250 --> 01:02:06,358
the you know phosphorus mining and fish

1434
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:08,070
emulsion that we have to like you know

1435
01:02:06,358 --> 01:02:09,840
drive a thousand miles and put on our

1436
01:02:08,070 --> 01:02:13,109
land like I'm all about growing

1437
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:14,700
bioaccumulate errs and extracting what

1438
01:02:13,108 --> 01:02:15,809
we can from the land in a sustainable

1439
01:02:14,699 --> 01:02:20,099
way and reusing it

1440
01:02:15,809 --> 01:02:23,190
oh yeah let's do this studies so you had

1441
01:02:20,099 --> 01:02:24,599
mentioned in our email you have

1442
01:02:23,190 --> 01:02:27,480
something about explaining techniques

1443
01:02:24,599 --> 01:02:28,619
for extending effects can you touch on

1444
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:31,980
that a little bit or what you meant by

1445
01:02:28,619 --> 01:02:33,900
that yes like I was talking about with

1446
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:36,059
the bacterias they kind of peak and then

1447
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:39,059
plummet and same thing with the

1448
01:02:36,059 --> 01:02:41,420
mycorrhizal fungi is they the reason

1449
01:02:39,059 --> 01:02:44,279
that we include sugars in our blends is

1450
01:02:41,420 --> 01:02:45,840
that those are the preferred those are

1451
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:48,000
best the food source of the bacteria in

1452
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:52,260
the fungi that fuels the whole soil food

1453
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:54,090
web so what we've come out with is this

1454
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:57,300
product called my coach um which has

1455
01:02:54,090 --> 01:02:59,940
fish hydrolysate which as opposed to

1456
01:02:57,300 --> 01:03:02,640
emulsion you had the gentleman from DRAM

1457
01:02:59,940 --> 01:03:04,950
on and I just loved his explanation of

1458
01:03:02,639 --> 01:03:07,619
how that works but essentially the

1459
01:03:04,949 --> 01:03:11,509
hydrolysate is much better for bacteria

1460
01:03:07,619 --> 01:03:15,420
and fungi because it contains all of the

1461
01:03:11,510 --> 01:03:18,240
proteins and fatty acids and a much more

1462
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:21,720
diverse palette of foods for these soil

1463
01:03:18,239 --> 01:03:24,889
organisms as well we have kelp which has

1464
01:03:21,719 --> 01:03:26,849
a huge array of micronutrients we have

1465
01:03:24,889 --> 01:03:29,069
molasses once again high in

1466
01:03:26,849 --> 01:03:31,500
carbohydrates and micronutrients and

1467
01:03:29,070 --> 01:03:36,180
then your humic acids which have your

1468
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:40,260
humic substances so it's feeding the

1469
01:03:36,179 --> 01:03:42,690
microbes is one thing that I think is

1470
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:44,940
really a beneficial thing to do it's

1471
01:03:42,690 --> 01:03:47,130
it's adding your compost teas regularly

1472
01:03:44,940 --> 01:03:48,599
it's you know topping off your compost

1473
01:03:47,130 --> 01:03:50,460
teas after you're done brewing them with

1474
01:03:48,599 --> 01:03:53,099
a little bit of kind of those things

1475
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:57,240
that I just talked about to extend their

1476
01:03:53,099 --> 01:03:59,460
life in the soil so we've over the years

1477
01:03:57,239 --> 01:04:02,459
you know the things that we cultures and

1478
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:05,849
grow these mike rizzo fungi with and

1479
01:04:02,460 --> 01:04:08,070
we've run the gamut of soups to feed

1480
01:04:05,849 --> 01:04:10,980
these things and to see their responses

1481
01:04:08,070 --> 01:04:13,050
is this is what this my coach um product

1482
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:16,949
is is these are all of the the foods

1483
01:04:13,050 --> 01:04:18,930
that the soil food web thrives on so

1484
01:04:16,949 --> 01:04:21,329
yeah what I meant by that was just

1485
01:04:18,929 --> 01:04:22,769
feeding these organisms encouraging

1486
01:04:21,329 --> 01:04:24,750
these organisms and it's all the same

1487
01:04:22,769 --> 01:04:26,340
things that well generally that plants

1488
01:04:24,750 --> 01:04:29,309
like right so you have good aeration

1489
01:04:26,340 --> 01:04:33,870
you have a stable pH

1490
01:04:29,309 --> 01:04:35,250
you have you know good water content

1491
01:04:33,869 --> 01:04:37,799
you're not over watering you're not

1492
01:04:35,250 --> 01:04:39,719
under watering and you're providing a

1493
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:44,519
food for these organisms you know things

1494
01:04:39,719 --> 01:04:47,730
like biochar that provide a habitat if

1495
01:04:44,519 --> 01:04:51,329
you will for these organisms is super

1496
01:04:47,730 --> 01:04:54,090
beneficial but really culturing and

1497
01:04:51,329 --> 01:04:56,579
nurturing these soil organisms is is

1498
01:04:54,090 --> 01:04:58,260
what I was talking about so you you know

1499
01:04:56,579 --> 01:05:00,840
you have a healthy population of

1500
01:04:58,260 --> 01:05:04,110
bacteria that doesn't plummet and then

1501
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:06,200
rely solely on the plant exudates is you

1502
01:05:04,110 --> 01:05:08,910
can kind of keep it running at a peak of

1503
01:05:06,199 --> 01:05:11,129
soluble izing any nutrients in the soil

1504
01:05:08,909 --> 01:05:13,859
making available available to the plant

1505
01:05:11,130 --> 01:05:15,869
so there's like excess of these enzymes

1506
01:05:13,860 --> 01:05:17,670
and micronutrients available to the

1507
01:05:15,869 --> 01:05:19,670
plant instead of sort of letting them

1508
01:05:17,670 --> 01:05:24,329
die back and then there's a bare minimum

1509
01:05:19,670 --> 01:05:26,430
so you know it's the same logic as like

1510
01:05:24,329 --> 01:05:28,590
I said the adding compost teas to your

1511
01:05:26,429 --> 01:05:30,539
soils you're just kind of maxing out

1512
01:05:28,590 --> 01:05:35,460
that soil biology so that when the plant

1513
01:05:30,539 --> 01:05:37,860
needs it the soil food web delivers okay

1514
01:05:35,460 --> 01:05:40,190
that makes sense I you know I got a cop

1515
01:05:37,860 --> 01:05:42,539
copy I mean I got a sample of the

1516
01:05:40,190 --> 01:05:44,190
miCoach um I keep wanting to call it

1517
01:05:42,539 --> 01:05:44,699
Chum food I think I don't know why I do

1518
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:47,099
that

1519
01:05:44,699 --> 01:05:49,109
but the micro jump so the micro Chum

1520
01:05:47,099 --> 01:05:51,539
does not have my kreizel fungus in it

1521
01:05:49,110 --> 01:05:54,480
but rather it's this combination of fish

1522
01:05:51,539 --> 01:05:56,670
kelp humic at a very good price point

1523
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:58,980
I'm excited to try it out my next round

1524
01:05:56,670 --> 01:06:01,980
of microscope testing it's at the top of

1525
01:05:58,980 --> 01:06:03,780
my list of things to experiment with to

1526
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:05,730
see how it works with compost teas and

1527
01:06:03,780 --> 01:06:08,250
what its effect are is on soil microbes

1528
01:06:05,730 --> 01:06:09,719
so yeah and I have a I have an order

1529
01:06:08,250 --> 01:06:11,760
coming in if there's any listeners that

1530
01:06:09,719 --> 01:06:13,319
want to try it out they can reach out to

1531
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:14,880
me via email but it's not available on

1532
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:17,400
our website yet but we can definitely

1533
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:19,460
help get some into your hands I know I'm

1534
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:21,900
sending some to my buddy Nelson down in

1535
01:06:19,460 --> 01:06:24,240
California to do some experiments so

1536
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:25,829
yeah I'm excited to hear I'm decided to

1537
01:06:24,239 --> 01:06:29,309
hear what's going on with that product

1538
01:06:25,829 --> 01:06:32,069
but let's go ahead and jump in and talk

1539
01:06:29,309 --> 01:06:35,579
about the bacteria now and some of these

1540
01:06:32,070 --> 01:06:37,260
other microbes in your soil because you

1541
01:06:35,579 --> 01:06:40,349
and I talked off air about this I had

1542
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:42,180
some questions that you that you

1543
01:06:40,349 --> 01:06:43,019
addressed when we had earlier

1544
01:06:42,179 --> 01:06:45,269
discussions be

1545
01:06:43,019 --> 01:06:48,860
as one of the things that I've seen is

1546
01:06:45,269 --> 01:06:53,759
there's a lot of mixed opinions around

1547
01:06:48,860 --> 01:06:55,230
Trichoderma and mycorrhizal fungus you

1548
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:56,760
know if you if you look at some of the

1549
01:06:55,230 --> 01:06:58,289
research and there's a variety of

1550
01:06:56,760 --> 01:06:59,580
research out there one of them was a

1551
01:06:58,289 --> 01:07:02,579
study at the University of Florida

1552
01:06:59,579 --> 01:07:05,610
showing that Trichoderma inhibited

1553
01:07:02,579 --> 01:07:07,349
mycorrhizal infection in plants along

1554
01:07:05,610 --> 01:07:09,510
with high phosphorus that one's fairly

1555
01:07:07,349 --> 01:07:11,339
well-established cuz you know one of the

1556
01:07:09,510 --> 01:07:13,440
main benefits of mycorrhizae is that

1557
01:07:11,340 --> 01:07:14,880
phosphorus or relationship so if the

1558
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:16,289
plants already getting plenty of

1559
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:18,090
phosphorus and thinks oh I don't need

1560
01:07:16,289 --> 01:07:19,590
this micro as a relationship even though

1561
01:07:18,090 --> 01:07:21,300
the mycorrhizae has a bunch of other

1562
01:07:19,590 --> 01:07:23,180
benefits that you already mentioned for

1563
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:26,190
the plants so we want to avoid high P

1564
01:07:23,179 --> 01:07:28,440
early on after but you know before the

1565
01:07:26,190 --> 01:07:29,840
plant has time to get that infection but

1566
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:31,800
would trichoderma

1567
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:33,960
you know there's there's a lot of

1568
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:35,039
different species of trichoderma so

1569
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:38,309
which is I think important to

1570
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:40,380
differentiate but then in addition to

1571
01:07:38,309 --> 01:07:43,219
that you know it's been shown to inhibit

1572
01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:46,829
spore germination and colonization of

1573
01:07:43,219 --> 01:07:49,379
you know mycorrhizal fungi particularly

1574
01:07:46,829 --> 01:07:52,650
the endo species what are your what are

1575
01:07:49,380 --> 01:07:55,349
some of your thoughts on that yeah so I

1576
01:07:52,650 --> 01:07:56,730
think that you know it definitely has

1577
01:07:55,349 --> 01:08:00,599
been documented that

1578
01:07:56,730 --> 01:08:05,340
Trichoderma can inhibit or can consume

1579
01:08:00,599 --> 01:08:08,599
my gradual spores or it can also sort of

1580
01:08:05,340 --> 01:08:12,660
inhibit them mycelium grows to a degree

1581
01:08:08,599 --> 01:08:15,329
I think there's a lot more testing that

1582
01:08:12,659 --> 01:08:17,189
needs to be done so there's also other

1583
01:08:15,329 --> 01:08:21,079
studies that show there's absolutely no

1584
01:08:17,189 --> 01:08:24,169
effect there's a there's a study out of

1585
01:08:21,079 --> 01:08:26,460
Spain that

1586
01:08:24,170 --> 01:08:28,079
can't see the University but I'm

1587
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:34,140
actually looking at it right now

1588
01:08:28,079 --> 01:08:35,519
so they used trichoderma I don't I can't

1589
01:08:34,140 --> 01:08:38,940
see the species it's somewhere in here

1590
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:44,760
but Columbus Moss a Glomus desert Accola

1591
01:08:38,939 --> 01:08:46,199
and they showed yeah I can't find the

1592
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:49,260
Trichoderma species but they showed zero

1593
01:08:46,199 --> 01:08:52,979
effect on colonization so this study was

1594
01:08:49,260 --> 01:08:54,659
done in 2000 but yeah I think that I

1595
01:08:52,979 --> 01:08:56,909
think there's more research yet to be

1596
01:08:54,659 --> 01:08:59,489
done and what would we

1597
01:08:56,909 --> 01:09:02,849
seen in the studies that we did and in

1598
01:08:59,489 --> 01:09:04,500
our research that we accumulated before

1599
01:09:02,850 --> 01:09:08,160
we made the products is that there's

1600
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:10,920
actually a symbiotic there's a there's a

1601
01:09:08,159 --> 01:09:15,750
beneficial effect using both of them so

1602
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:17,069
you know there's certain benefits of the

1603
01:09:15,750 --> 01:09:19,109
Trichoderma provided and then there's

1604
01:09:17,069 --> 01:09:22,439
certain benefits that the mycorrhizal

1605
01:09:19,109 --> 01:09:24,329
fungi provides and you know i think when

1606
01:09:22,439 --> 01:09:25,589
they're used in combination you actually

1607
01:09:24,329 --> 01:09:27,090
get a little bit of both

1608
01:09:25,590 --> 01:09:28,560
and i don't think it's a black-and-white

1609
01:09:27,090 --> 01:09:30,270
thing i think like you said there's

1610
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:31,620
there's so many different soil

1611
01:09:30,270 --> 01:09:35,580
conditions there's so many different

1612
01:09:31,619 --> 01:09:38,189
species and you know what we based our

1613
01:09:35,579 --> 01:09:38,909
for we have our products don't have

1614
01:09:38,189 --> 01:09:41,189
trichoderma

1615
01:09:38,909 --> 01:09:43,050
so once again we have the gamut of

1616
01:09:41,189 --> 01:09:45,719
products if you're interested in having

1617
01:09:43,050 --> 01:09:49,020
one with or without like our famous or

1618
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:51,270
famous our one of our products the Orca

1619
01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:54,120
the liquid version of great white

1620
01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:56,940
doesn't have trichoderma so we have

1621
01:09:54,119 --> 01:09:59,099
products without it but that being said

1622
01:09:56,939 --> 01:10:02,159
great whites still my favorite products

1623
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:05,310
which has the trichoderma in it once

1624
01:10:02,159 --> 01:10:08,369
again you know the benefits of the

1625
01:10:05,310 --> 01:10:10,500
trichoderma well one of them is just a

1626
01:10:08,369 --> 01:10:12,059
really really high enzyme release so

1627
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:14,789
this one's breaking down organic matter

1628
01:10:12,060 --> 01:10:18,000
at a really fast rate compared to other

1629
01:10:14,789 --> 01:10:19,739
bacteria but also like I said there's

1630
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:22,590
benefits that I can't make any claims

1631
01:10:19,739 --> 01:10:24,739
about but if you google Trichoderma you

1632
01:10:22,590 --> 01:10:28,380
know there's some bio pesticide research

1633
01:10:24,739 --> 01:10:30,119
about it so you know some people stagger

1634
01:10:28,380 --> 01:10:32,250
their inoculations right so they'll

1635
01:10:30,119 --> 01:10:33,689
inoculate with the mycorrhizae and then

1636
01:10:32,250 --> 01:10:35,939
they'll inoculate with trichoderma a

1637
01:10:33,689 --> 01:10:38,429
little bit later but one of the things

1638
01:10:35,939 --> 01:10:40,289
that i like to point out is that lab

1639
01:10:38,430 --> 01:10:44,600
conditions are so drastically different

1640
01:10:40,289 --> 01:10:47,100
from TRICARE from field conditions so

1641
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:49,650
some of these studies you know

1642
01:10:47,100 --> 01:10:51,329
documented oh hey this is possible right

1643
01:10:49,649 --> 01:10:53,189
like so the trichoderma can become

1644
01:10:51,329 --> 01:10:56,189
antagonistic towards the mycorrhizae

1645
01:10:53,189 --> 01:10:58,439
fungi in a petri dish you know not

1646
01:10:56,189 --> 01:11:00,539
necessarily in a growing environment and

1647
01:10:58,439 --> 01:11:02,909
one thing about trichoderma is it's

1648
01:11:00,539 --> 01:11:05,519
absolutely everywhere so if you ever try

1649
01:11:02,909 --> 01:11:09,479
and culture like mushrooms indoors for

1650
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:10,680
example oysters or shiitakes or anything

1651
01:11:09,479 --> 01:11:13,319
like that

1652
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:15,810
one of the main you know things that

1653
01:11:13,319 --> 01:11:18,210
affects your your media is actually

1654
01:11:15,810 --> 01:11:20,160
Trichoderma so it's we're breathing it

1655
01:11:18,210 --> 01:11:22,859
in right now it's absolutely everywhere

1656
01:11:20,159 --> 01:11:25,680
and it's ubiquitous and soils so it's

1657
01:11:22,859 --> 01:11:27,509
already there and the question is how do

1658
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:31,170
these things interact in the soil

1659
01:11:27,510 --> 01:11:33,930
environment and from you know as far as

1660
01:11:31,170 --> 01:11:35,699
we can tell there's a really big there's

1661
01:11:33,930 --> 01:11:38,100
there's a big benefit to actually having

1662
01:11:35,699 --> 01:11:39,989
it in your medium and whether or not you

1663
01:11:38,100 --> 01:11:42,240
stagger the inoculations you know that's

1664
01:11:39,989 --> 01:11:45,300
up to you but you know we've been doing

1665
01:11:42,239 --> 01:11:47,550
this for 15 years with the great white

1666
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:50,400
and that's the product that has it in

1667
01:11:47,550 --> 01:11:52,310
there and growers just have tremendous

1668
01:11:50,399 --> 01:11:56,250
results I think if they're if they're

1669
01:11:52,310 --> 01:11:59,280
we've seen a benefit and we you know in

1670
01:11:56,250 --> 01:12:01,739
using both in combination I think in if

1671
01:11:59,279 --> 01:12:04,550
there is a situation where it's becoming

1672
01:12:01,739 --> 01:12:06,479
antagonistic to the micro fungi it's I

1673
01:12:04,550 --> 01:12:08,390
don't know I feel like people are

1674
01:12:06,479 --> 01:12:11,429
sometimes splitting hairs over this like

1675
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:12,950
clearly using a product like great white

1676
01:12:11,430 --> 01:12:15,960
with trichoderma

1677
01:12:12,949 --> 01:12:17,970
outperforms non inoculation every time

1678
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:20,539
and even when compared with saying that

1679
01:12:17,970 --> 01:12:22,800
for example a single species mycorrhizal

1680
01:12:20,539 --> 01:12:24,539
versus of you know a multiple species

1681
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:27,300
mycorrhizae with multiple species

1682
01:12:24,539 --> 01:12:32,399
bacteria and Trichoderma it just

1683
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:34,440
performs fantastic so I think there's a

1684
01:12:32,399 --> 01:12:35,639
lot more research yet to be done and I

1685
01:12:34,439 --> 01:12:39,619
don't think it's black and white

1686
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:43,490
I think Elaine Ingham is a really

1687
01:12:39,619 --> 01:12:46,050
amazing researcher and a lot of her

1688
01:12:43,489 --> 01:12:49,500
actual field knowledge of how this stuff

1689
01:12:46,050 --> 01:12:52,140
performs in actual soil conditions is

1690
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:54,000
very valuable and from the testing that

1691
01:12:52,140 --> 01:12:56,310
we've done and the feedback that we've

1692
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:59,640
gotten from our friends and growers is

1693
01:12:56,310 --> 01:13:01,860
that it works really well so you know I

1694
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:05,280
don't I don't think the the jury's in on

1695
01:13:01,859 --> 01:13:07,079
that but like I said I have access to

1696
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:09,300
all of our all of the products here at

1697
01:13:07,079 --> 01:13:12,920
the company and I consistently you know

1698
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:12,920
great white for me is the pinnacle oh

1699
01:13:13,100 --> 01:13:18,660
yeah you brought up a few different

1700
01:13:15,630 --> 01:13:19,800
points I want to touch on here so it's

1701
01:13:18,659 --> 01:13:21,510
it's pretty well established that

1702
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:25,230
Trichoderma attacks mycorrhizae and

1703
01:13:21,510 --> 01:13:28,869
plate assays like you mentioned but

1704
01:13:25,229 --> 01:13:31,209
in in soils like like I've seen some

1705
01:13:28,869 --> 01:13:33,340
studies that show it does cause damage

1706
01:13:31,210 --> 01:13:35,050
to the mycorrhizal infection rates but

1707
01:13:33,340 --> 01:13:36,730
there's also other ones that show that

1708
01:13:35,050 --> 01:13:39,070
maybe the spatial distribution in soils

1709
01:13:36,729 --> 01:13:42,839
allowed both to function normally or to

1710
01:13:39,069 --> 01:13:47,409
have a synergistic positive interactions

1711
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:49,659
so I think you really need to experiment

1712
01:13:47,409 --> 01:13:52,149
with it and then ultimately you might be

1713
01:13:49,659 --> 01:13:54,489
right that yes if it is the Trichoderma

1714
01:13:52,149 --> 01:13:56,289
that is providing the benefit like

1715
01:13:54,489 --> 01:13:58,920
that's something that Tim Wilson the

1716
01:13:56,289 --> 01:14:00,819
microbe organics is speculated for years

1717
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:02,500
at the end of the day doesn't really

1718
01:14:00,819 --> 01:14:04,329
matter if you're getting a plant growth

1719
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:07,000
response or plant Health's response that

1720
01:14:04,329 --> 01:14:09,340
you want anyway does it matter if it was

1721
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:10,840
the Trichoderma or the you know my

1722
01:14:09,340 --> 01:14:13,690
kreizel infection that's providing these

1723
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:16,360
benefits one thing I've always wondered

1724
01:14:13,689 --> 01:14:18,250
about though is really so like you

1725
01:14:16,359 --> 01:14:22,119
mentioned trichoderma is ubiquitous it's

1726
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:23,920
it's an aggressive microbe when you're

1727
01:14:22,119 --> 01:14:27,069
putting in say a hundred and eighty

1728
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:30,190
seven thousand CF use per gram how does

1729
01:14:27,069 --> 01:14:32,979
how does a endo micro rise that you know

1730
01:14:30,189 --> 01:14:36,419
a mere two hundred spores per gram our

1731
01:14:32,979 --> 01:14:38,889
property Gil's program really compete

1732
01:14:36,420 --> 01:14:40,600
compete in that space that's that's one

1733
01:14:38,890 --> 01:14:42,850
question I've always had about is sort

1734
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:44,500
of the the difference in concentrations

1735
01:14:42,850 --> 01:14:47,320
I know Trichoderma is a lot more

1736
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:48,909
affordable to add into these products

1737
01:14:47,319 --> 01:14:52,929
but why though why the different

1738
01:14:48,909 --> 01:14:56,409
discrepancy in the rates I guess yeah so

1739
01:14:52,930 --> 01:14:59,170
you know one thing is that you know the

1740
01:14:56,409 --> 01:15:02,079
great white in testing has shown you

1741
01:14:59,170 --> 01:15:04,000
know break my gradual colonization of

1742
01:15:02,079 --> 01:15:05,859
the root system so it's an effective

1743
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:10,270
product and the mycorrhizae is still

1744
01:15:05,859 --> 01:15:14,349
infecting the plants or the successful

1745
01:15:10,270 --> 01:15:18,100
rate in terms of yeah the question you

1746
01:15:14,350 --> 01:15:20,560
know I'd have to ask the researchers on

1747
01:15:18,100 --> 01:15:22,539
that or the you know our tech ties

1748
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:24,910
because I don't I don't know the answer

1749
01:15:22,539 --> 01:15:27,489
of that and and like you said I that

1750
01:15:24,909 --> 01:15:29,319
research of the spatial distribution is

1751
01:15:27,489 --> 01:15:31,389
important to allow each to sort of

1752
01:15:29,319 --> 01:15:35,099
function and not cannibalize you know

1753
01:15:31,390 --> 01:15:37,780
the Mike herb you know eat the micro Z

1754
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:40,289
so yeah that's a good question

1755
01:15:37,779 --> 01:15:40,289
about

1756
01:15:40,380 --> 01:15:48,250
the concentrations but yeah like I said

1757
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:49,810
at this point the product is successful

1758
01:15:48,250 --> 01:15:50,948
and works and has a high colonization

1759
01:15:49,810 --> 01:15:53,830
right but I don't know how that actually

1760
01:15:50,948 --> 01:15:54,609
plays out with the ratio there so that's

1761
01:15:53,829 --> 01:15:57,219
a good question

1762
01:15:54,609 --> 01:16:00,099
another one I'll have to do more

1763
01:15:57,219 --> 01:16:01,840
research on okay and you know to touch

1764
01:16:00,100 --> 01:16:06,010
on some of these other bacteria that you

1765
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:08,909
have in in the product that I recognize

1766
01:16:06,010 --> 01:16:11,230
like bacillus subtilis that's in

1767
01:16:08,908 --> 01:16:13,210
serenade and a bunch of other products

1768
01:16:11,229 --> 01:16:16,209
as you know again particular species of

1769
01:16:13,210 --> 01:16:17,198
bacillus subtilis but that's another one

1770
01:16:16,210 --> 01:16:19,600
that's been shown to have a lot of

1771
01:16:17,198 --> 01:16:22,029
different plant benefits the bacillus

1772
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:27,100
thuringiensis i can never pronounce it

1773
01:16:22,029 --> 01:16:29,649
the bt the israelis species is one

1774
01:16:27,100 --> 01:16:31,300
that's super useful when trying to

1775
01:16:29,649 --> 01:16:34,299
control fungus gnats and other issues

1776
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:36,880
like that or caterpillars it's it's a

1777
01:16:34,300 --> 01:16:39,039
spray-on so that has a lot of benefits

1778
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:40,980
and then I notice you have Saccharomyces

1779
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:45,010
service a which is brewers yeast

1780
01:16:40,979 --> 01:16:48,789
essentially in there is that I I know

1781
01:16:45,010 --> 01:16:51,219
people are taking barley seeds and

1782
01:16:48,789 --> 01:16:53,710
grinding those up as a way of and as

1783
01:16:51,219 --> 01:16:55,869
something also from the brewing industry

1784
01:16:53,710 --> 01:16:58,719
and I've read some really wonderful

1785
01:16:55,869 --> 01:17:00,130
books on that particular fungus but do

1786
01:16:58,719 --> 01:17:04,529
you happen to know much more about why

1787
01:17:00,130 --> 01:17:04,529
what benefits that has in the soil so

1788
01:17:04,890 --> 01:17:11,739
that species specifically I am not well

1789
01:17:09,130 --> 01:17:14,469
I'm not a bacterial expert I will say

1790
01:17:11,738 --> 01:17:16,809
that to get though yeah I don't have

1791
01:17:14,469 --> 01:17:19,179
actually a ton of research on the sacrum

1792
01:17:16,810 --> 01:17:22,600
I deserve a CA besides the beer that I

1793
01:17:19,179 --> 01:17:26,109
threw you probably actually are more of

1794
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:28,270
an expert on that than I am so yeah but

1795
01:17:26,109 --> 01:17:32,289
bacteria in general you kind of already

1796
01:17:28,270 --> 01:17:34,270
cover it but you know the sort of a lot

1797
01:17:32,289 --> 01:17:37,300
of them do a lot of the same things I'm

1798
01:17:34,270 --> 01:17:40,179
just kind of from a different different

1799
01:17:37,300 --> 01:17:43,239
species different angle but in general

1800
01:17:40,179 --> 01:17:45,929
you're getting you know nitrogen

1801
01:17:43,238 --> 01:17:49,138
fixation phosphorus solubilization

1802
01:17:45,929 --> 01:17:51,100
micronutrients ah legalization and

1803
01:17:49,139 --> 01:17:52,420
enzyme production

1804
01:17:51,100 --> 01:17:56,289
they also

1805
01:17:52,420 --> 01:17:58,719
to create organic glues like high carbon

1806
01:17:56,289 --> 01:18:03,579
glues that help with soil structure over

1807
01:17:58,719 --> 01:18:05,948
the long term and so yeah those are the

1808
01:18:03,579 --> 01:18:08,559
big benefits and and and that really

1809
01:18:05,948 --> 01:18:11,799
works in synthesis or in combination

1810
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:14,980
with the mycorrhizae fungi in and help

1811
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:18,969
with their needs and their sort of

1812
01:18:14,979 --> 01:18:22,238
ability to extract these micro nutrients

1813
01:18:18,969 --> 01:18:25,210
from the soil so you know we include

1814
01:18:22,238 --> 01:18:26,889
them we're more specialized we we cut

1815
01:18:25,210 --> 01:18:30,670
our teeth and and we started in the

1816
01:18:26,890 --> 01:18:32,980
mycorrhizal base and you know slowly

1817
01:18:30,670 --> 01:18:34,810
included bacteria in our product so like

1818
01:18:32,979 --> 01:18:38,049
I said I'm not an expert on the bacteria

1819
01:18:34,810 --> 01:18:40,710
but those are just sort of an overview

1820
01:18:38,050 --> 01:18:45,520
of what they do and what they add to our

1821
01:18:40,710 --> 01:18:51,250
microbe products okay I know there's a

1822
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:53,650
lot we don't know as a you know as a

1823
01:18:51,250 --> 01:18:55,090
species about all of these things like

1824
01:18:53,649 --> 01:18:57,069
humans are still learning so much about

1825
01:18:55,090 --> 01:18:58,360
all of these different microbes and how

1826
01:18:57,069 --> 01:19:01,299
they interact and discovering new

1827
01:18:58,359 --> 01:19:04,210
microbes and so I I don't expect you to

1828
01:19:01,300 --> 01:19:07,150
have all the answers by any means right

1829
01:19:04,210 --> 01:19:09,390
but I we are seeing you know with all

1830
01:19:07,149 --> 01:19:11,859
this research that diversity really is

1831
01:19:09,390 --> 01:19:15,130
one of the most important things when it

1832
01:19:11,859 --> 01:19:16,539
comes to soil health so I mean I can see

1833
01:19:15,130 --> 01:19:19,420
why you would want to be applying a

1834
01:19:16,539 --> 01:19:22,929
diversity of microbes when you're yeah

1835
01:19:19,420 --> 01:19:24,760
yeah yeah one thing that blows my mind

1836
01:19:22,929 --> 01:19:27,670
is like the microscope has only been

1837
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:30,550
around for like you know a hundred years

1838
01:19:27,670 --> 01:19:33,899
and and popular use for for less than

1839
01:19:30,550 --> 01:19:37,570
that so you know this whole world of

1840
01:19:33,899 --> 01:19:40,479
microbes is is just coming into focus

1841
01:19:37,569 --> 01:19:43,029
for us as a species and you know there's

1842
01:19:40,479 --> 01:19:45,759
hundreds of thousands of species out

1843
01:19:43,029 --> 01:19:48,460
there that aren't tested you know your

1844
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:51,400
average compost bin is like talk about

1845
01:19:48,460 --> 01:19:53,198
diverse these are just the species that

1846
01:19:51,399 --> 01:19:55,960
we've isolated and actually ran through

1847
01:19:53,198 --> 01:19:57,939
the gamut of expensive testing to see

1848
01:19:55,960 --> 01:20:00,730
their benefits on agriculture and plant

1849
01:19:57,939 --> 01:20:03,359
growth but this is just the tip of the

1850
01:20:00,729 --> 01:20:05,948
iceberg there's there's so much extra

1851
01:20:03,359 --> 01:20:07,839
there's so many of them someone

1852
01:20:05,948 --> 01:20:09,609
diversity out there that we don't know

1853
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:11,650
about and you know in general like you

1854
01:20:09,609 --> 01:20:13,478
said it's it's about diversity and it's

1855
01:20:11,649 --> 01:20:16,689
about sort of doing those things like

1856
01:20:13,479 --> 01:20:19,780
you know composting and compost teas and

1857
01:20:16,689 --> 01:20:21,609
you know all those practices that in my

1858
01:20:19,779 --> 01:20:24,429
mind they mimic natural systems right

1859
01:20:21,609 --> 01:20:26,380
this is this is how these the forest is

1860
01:20:24,429 --> 01:20:29,288
one of the most productive ecosystems on

1861
01:20:26,380 --> 01:20:31,449
the planet and it's all passive right

1862
01:20:29,288 --> 01:20:35,228
it's all everything leads into into

1863
01:20:31,448 --> 01:20:37,629
something else nothing's wasted so a lot

1864
01:20:35,229 --> 01:20:38,769
of what we're doing in my mind you know

1865
01:20:37,630 --> 01:20:42,248
we're learning more about how these

1866
01:20:38,769 --> 01:20:44,619
systems function but a lot of of what I

1867
01:20:42,248 --> 01:20:47,769
do and what we do as a company is really

1868
01:20:44,618 --> 01:20:49,420
just trying to mimic the best of these

1869
01:20:47,769 --> 01:20:52,360
these natural systems and their

1870
01:20:49,420 --> 01:20:56,349
efficiency so yeah there's a lot left to

1871
01:20:52,359 --> 01:20:58,389
learn I totally agree and I love the

1872
01:20:56,349 --> 01:21:00,550
idea of trying to just balance and

1873
01:20:58,389 --> 01:21:02,260
recreate these ecological systems like

1874
01:21:00,550 --> 01:21:06,130
you said that we know are highly

1875
01:21:02,260 --> 01:21:07,809
functional and sustainable so yeah

1876
01:21:06,130 --> 01:21:09,909
thanks for coming on the show today was

1877
01:21:07,809 --> 01:21:11,260
there anything else that I I'm out of

1878
01:21:09,908 --> 01:21:14,170
questions anything else you wanted to

1879
01:21:11,260 --> 01:21:15,998
touch on though before we go no I think

1880
01:21:14,170 --> 01:21:18,279
that that pretty much covers it all

1881
01:21:15,998 --> 01:21:21,550
right well I really appreciate your time

1882
01:21:18,279 --> 01:21:23,529
today thanks again and I look forward to

1883
01:21:21,550 --> 01:21:26,708
meeting you in person and talking again

1884
01:21:23,529 --> 01:21:30,069

feedback on them since posting and hope

1908
01:22:20,170 --> 01:22:24,159
to get Jaya Palmer back on the podcast

1909
01:22:21,819 --> 01:22:28,500
soon to discuss his methodology and how

1910
01:22:24,159 --> 01:22:28,500
he set up the trial thanks for listening
