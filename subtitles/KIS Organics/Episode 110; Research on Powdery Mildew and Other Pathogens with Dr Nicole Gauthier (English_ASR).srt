where we discuss The Cutting Edge of

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,000
growing from a science-based perspective

9
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:31,439
and drawing top experts from around the

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,539
industry to share their wisdom and

11
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,238
knowledge my guest this week is Dr

12
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:37,738
Nicole goche she is a professor and

13
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:40,439
extension specialist at the University

14
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:42,238
of Kentucky her program focuses on

15
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:45,058
disease management of specialty crops

16
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:46,738
including hemp in her extension role she

17
00:00:45,058 --> 00:00:48,659
develops educational and Outreach

18
00:00:46,738 --> 00:00:50,238
programs to help Growers manage disease

19
00:00:48,659 --> 00:00:52,979
through identification

20
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:54,599
understanding of patho systems and

21
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:57,419
integration and management strategies

22
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,179
her research program focuses on a range

23
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:03,300
of hemp diseases including fusarium head

24
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:05,400
blight Dr gotcha earned her Bachelor of

25
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:07,438

she joined the UK College of agriculture

29
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:16,618
in 2011 and began working with

30
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:18,659
Industrial Hemp in 2014. there will be a

31
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:20,879
link on the podcast page to access her

32
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:22,380
resources and research now on to the

33
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:24,060
show

34
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:25,199
hi Nicole thanks for coming on the show

35
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,540
today

36
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,359
hello how are you

37
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:33,840
I I'm good I'm really excited to talk to

38
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:35,819
you today uh I've seen on LinkedIn that

39
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,978
uh Paul coxon who's been on the show

40
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:39,359
before had linked to some of your

41
00:01:37,978 --> 00:01:41,759
research so I reached out to you

42
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:42,900
directly and you were so kind to take my

43
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,140
message

44
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:47,219
messages and um can we just start off

45
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,420
telling listeners a little about

46
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:51,298
yourself and then we can talk a little

47
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:53,460
bit about your research okay sure I am a

48
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:57,299
plant pathologist which means I study

49
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:59,158
disease and um actually I am I'm a

50
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:02,100
professor of Plant Pathology with a

51
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:04,380
specialization in extension so extension

52
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:07,679
specialist is what a lot of uh Farmers

53
00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:09,478
call me and by extension meaning that we

54
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,200
or the interface between the university

55
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:17,280
and Growers so every state has extension

56
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:19,799
uh faculty and then most counties within

57
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,140
a state will have another component of

58
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:26,099
extension so I'm a specialist I

59
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:29,339
specialize in plant diseases and by crop

60
00:02:26,098 --> 00:02:32,098
I work with specialty crops and hemp has

61
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:34,739
been on my commodity assignment since

62
00:02:32,098 --> 00:02:38,179
2014 when the reintroduction came

63
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:40,739
through with the 2014 form bill

64
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:43,080
that's that's really exciting so you're

65
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:45,980
sort of the

66
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:48,300
uh the the Bridging the Gap between

67
00:02:45,979 --> 00:02:51,598
Academia and the university and then the

68
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:54,300
actual farmers and growers in your the

69
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:56,639
fall into your area is that that is

70
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:58,920
correct so I can work directly with

71
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:01,799
Farmers as long as it is a plant disease

72
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:03,839
issue or I can work with County agents

73
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,300
as part of their larger programming so

74
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,860
they're kind of boots on the ground

75
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,500
um and then

76
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:12,959
um I I write a lot of spray guides and

77
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,818
fact sheets and do a lot of training so

78
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,878
we train Growers and we train County

79
00:03:14,818 --> 00:03:19,919
agents so a lot of trainings and um of

80
00:03:17,878 --> 00:03:22,079
course in the modern era our trainings

81
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:24,658
can be anything from YouTube videos we

82
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,580
have a YouTube channel so anything from

83
00:03:24,658 --> 00:03:27,120
YouTube to

84
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,920
um

85
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,800
just some some

86
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:32,939
um featured videos that are a little bit

87
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,280
more

88
00:03:32,939 --> 00:03:38,158
um more published than some of our raw

89
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,019
video out in the field

90
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:42,120
okay well let's just let's just go ahead

91
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:45,180
and Dive Right In now one of the things

92
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,620
that we talked about off air was just

93
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,659
getting a good foundation and

94
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:51,599
understanding of sort of what plant

95
00:03:48,658 --> 00:03:54,899
disease is and what those what those are

96
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:55,560
in sort of the hemp cannabis world right

97
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,980
now

98
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:00,780
okay so uh we'll start by saying that

99
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:02,158
plant diseases

100
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,840
um those are the symptoms that's a

101
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:06,719
plant's reaction to whatever is

102
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,819
happening so it's an it's a um

103
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:11,280
it's a disorder so when we talk about

104
00:04:08,818 --> 00:04:14,098
disease we use terms like Wilt and

105
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,959
rotten and blight and those are usually

106
00:04:14,098 --> 00:04:18,180
descriptors

107
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:20,100
um now we have disease names so those

108
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,560
are kind of more colloquial right so

109
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:24,060
think of entomology or think of uh plant

110
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,519
names like we don't use the Latin

111
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:28,680
binomial every day we're using common

112
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:31,198
name so that's what diseases are disease

113
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:33,478
names are common names and so we'll call

114
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:36,419
flower blights or Leaf spots or circular

115
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:38,099
leaf spot or bipolaris leaf spot

116
00:04:36,418 --> 00:04:39,418
um powdery mildew so those are kind of

117
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:42,120
some some

118
00:04:39,418 --> 00:04:46,439
um some common names

119
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:49,379
um so uh diseases are caused by plant

120
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:52,740
pathogens and that's what we get into

121
00:04:49,379 --> 00:04:55,079
um fungi bacteria viruses uh water molds

122
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:57,478
or oo my seeds so that's when we start

123
00:04:55,079 --> 00:05:00,060
talking uh start talking with the Latin

124
00:04:57,478 --> 00:05:01,918
binomials that um most people don't

125
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:03,839
really like to talk about of course any

126
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:07,258
pathologist would love to talk to talk

127
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:10,560
the nerdy uh Latin to you but um

128
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:12,300
so when I study and when when

129
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,100
um a lot of times we make references we

130
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:16,740
do make references to those Latin

131
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:18,780
binomials because that causal agent or

132
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:21,478
that plant pathogen the fungus the

133
00:05:18,779 --> 00:05:23,399
bacterium the water mold it's really

134
00:05:21,478 --> 00:05:25,439
critical that we know what that is and

135
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:27,359
that's where my research comes in and so

136
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:29,219
that's yes I have the education and

137
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,139
Outreach component from extension but

138
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,220
that's where our research really Dives

139
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:34,680
in

140
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:37,020
um so to answer your question is we're

141
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:39,660
trying to figure out what exactly are

142
00:05:37,019 --> 00:05:42,719
those causal agents are they the same is

143
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:46,080
it the same circospora that causes a

144
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:48,120
leaf spot on soybeans or on tomatoes or

145
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:51,659
is it a different circospora for example

146
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:53,399
that causes the leaf spot on cannabis so

147
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:55,800
that is kind of part of the research

148
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:57,659
that I do is a kind of a fancy

149
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:00,180
diagnostic if you will and then

150
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:02,160
understanding the life cycles what are

151
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:04,680
the alternative hosts what is that Host

152
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,539
range how does it over winter

153
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:09,180
what are the optimal conditions for

154
00:06:06,538 --> 00:06:11,639
infection to occur and

155
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:13,978
um thus the the does the disease matter

156
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:15,960
right does it just make a spot for

157
00:06:13,978 --> 00:06:17,819
example on that leaf and it's in it

158
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:19,500
doesn't matter or is it something that

159
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:21,478
can be really devastating and and

160
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:25,199
detrimental to a crop and cause crop

161
00:06:21,478 --> 00:06:28,159
losses or food safety issues so nutshell

162
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,160
that's what I do

163
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:33,960
yeah so it sounds like identification is

164
00:06:30,538 --> 00:06:36,060
is critical in the entire process and I

165
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:39,239
know that's something that in reality

166
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:40,978
kind of gets skipped over or

167
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,019
um I guess push the side a little bit

168
00:06:40,978 --> 00:06:45,360
I'm wondering

169
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:48,060
from a grower perspective how important

170
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,759
is it that I know the actual species or

171
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:52,379
can I just say oh this is powdered

172
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:54,180
mildew because of the way it presents

173
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:56,759
and that's enough for me to at least

174
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:58,199
begin a treatment option or for

175
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:01,379
something you know something else like

176
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:04,379
fusarium or one of these other more

177
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:06,659
common diseases do we need do we need to

178
00:07:04,379 --> 00:07:10,879
dive that deep as a cultivator or can we

179
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:10,880
just sort of narrow it down

180
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:22,979
more modern techniques now we're

181
00:07:21,478 --> 00:07:25,978
starting to understand a little bit

182
00:07:22,978 --> 00:07:27,478
about just crops in general why may why

183
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:30,240
didn't management this management

184
00:07:27,478 --> 00:07:31,620
technique work five years ago or why is

185
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,478
it working for my neighbor and it's not

186
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:35,579
working for me

187
00:07:33,478 --> 00:07:39,418
um and um

188
00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:40,620
it may be really the the the pathogen

189
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:43,680
itself

190
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:44,939
I'll use fusarium as an example

191
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,459
um you know people who are not

192
00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:49,560
Pathologists they talk about fusarium f

193
00:07:47,459 --> 00:07:52,258
as if it's one thing

194
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:55,680
um there are so many different fusarium

195
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:57,000
um complexes and species that uh we're

196
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,879
finding

197
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,639
um for example as a fusarium Wilt we

198
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:07,319
have identified four different

199
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:08,879
um pharmacealis of fusarium oxysprum so

200
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:11,280
we're finding a lot of different ones

201
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,860
and that starts to matter that matters

202
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:16,799
on how it overwinters what the other

203
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:19,680
hosts are and and we do a lot of

204
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,840
fungicide sensitivity tests and

205
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,340
I know I don't want to get anyone in an

206
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:25,439
uproar but

207
00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:27,239
fungicides are used for a lot of crops

208
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:29,759
across the board so in Plant Pathology

209
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:33,060
that's one of the ways we characterize

210
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:35,519
pathogens is what is that sensitivity

211
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:37,079
we also do temperature sensitivities we

212
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:40,259
also do we do a lot of different

213
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:42,599
characterization studies but fungicide

214
00:08:40,259 --> 00:08:43,679
sensitivity is kind of like an in your

215
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:46,800
face

216
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:47,399
it shows differences right

217
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:49,679
um

218
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:51,539
and think about species what's the

219
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:54,299
difference between a cat and a lion

220
00:08:51,539 --> 00:08:56,039
right there's a huge difference in what

221
00:08:54,299 --> 00:08:58,199
we know in our everyday life so there's

222
00:08:56,039 --> 00:09:00,539
just as much difference across for

223
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:03,778
instance fungal pathogens and

224
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:07,259
um and the fusarium the fusarium

225
00:09:03,778 --> 00:09:08,820
oxysperum group or the fusarium all the

226
00:09:07,259 --> 00:09:12,299
other species the ones we're working on

227
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:13,620
that cause a bud and flower blight head

228
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:15,958
blight

229
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:19,799
um they're very different and it matters

230
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:21,239
it can matter more than others

231
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:23,579
um another another question you

232
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:25,259
mentioned powdery mildew we know that

233
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:27,180
there are two different powdery mildews

234
00:09:25,259 --> 00:09:27,958
different Genera

235
00:09:27,179 --> 00:09:30,359
um

236
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:33,239
of powdery mildews which one do you have

237
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:35,879
well one of them prefers about a it can

238
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:38,759
survive at about a 40 relative humidity

239
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:41,939
and the other one more in

240
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:45,120
um more than 70 relative humidity that's

241
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:47,820
huge uh 40 relative humidity really

242
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:51,299
plants are unhappy at that level versus

243
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:54,360
70 relative humidity a year kind of

244
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:56,819
plants are really happy there but so are

245
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:59,278
most of your fungal pathogens for

246
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:02,540
example and I I have I have a million

247
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:05,879
other examples of how species are are

248
00:10:02,539 --> 00:10:07,919
generous sometimes it really makes a

249
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:10,159
difference in in the grand scheme of

250
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:10,159
things

251
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:14,819
okay that was a very compelling argument

252
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:17,519
so

253
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:19,740
basically right so should a grower

254
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:22,019
should grower care commercial Growers

255
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:24,839
should absolutely care

256
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:25,860
um a small grower or a backyard grower

257
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:27,660
or

258
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,980
um you know somebody with a grow in

259
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:31,019
their basement

260
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:32,459
um won't matter as much

261
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:35,039
um but a commercial grower should

262
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:38,278
absolutely know because that's really

263
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:40,980
that sometimes that difference between

264
00:10:38,278 --> 00:10:42,419
um that real good profit margin or that

265
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:45,180
that really

266
00:10:42,419 --> 00:10:48,659
um high level efficacy of a management

267
00:10:45,179 --> 00:10:51,319
strategy versus just okay and we did it

268
00:10:48,659 --> 00:10:51,319
we did well

269
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,639
so if I I so I hear what you're saying

270
00:10:54,419 --> 00:10:58,500
you're basically saying that you know

271
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:59,699
even within fusarium we're gonna have

272
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,440
ones that have different temperature

273
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,180
ranges different

274
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,779
humidities

275
00:11:03,179 --> 00:11:07,259
um

276
00:11:03,778 --> 00:11:10,259
a different spread all these things are

277
00:11:07,259 --> 00:11:12,000
factors so so it does matter I I guess

278
00:11:10,259 --> 00:11:14,879
as a grower then

279
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,980
so if I were to walk into my

280
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:18,778
my room let's talk about an indoor

281
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:21,060
facility so controlled environment

282
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:22,139
agriculture

283
00:11:21,059 --> 00:11:25,139
um

284
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:26,639
I I see something on a plant that looks

285
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:28,799
off to me

286
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:31,199
um how do I determine that that's a

287
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:33,179
disease and not a nutrient deficiency

288
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,640
what are some keys that I would look for

289
00:11:33,179 --> 00:11:38,278
in terms of uh

290
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:39,958
physical display and then what should I

291
00:11:38,278 --> 00:11:43,139
do at that point what are my next steps

292
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:46,099
from a pathology perspective

293
00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:46,100
so um

294
00:11:46,379 --> 00:11:50,759
or not a diagnostic feature you need to

295
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,259
know you need to see the sides you need

296
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:53,700
to find those fungal spores or whatever

297
00:11:52,259 --> 00:11:55,740
and a grower is not going to have that

298
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:57,839
capability don't expect you to right

299
00:11:55,740 --> 00:12:01,079
that's what we're here for but if you

300
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:03,540
walk into your your basement or your

301
00:12:01,078 --> 00:12:05,159
huge facility or or a field like

302
00:12:03,539 --> 00:12:07,500
whatever it is so you kind of walk in

303
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:10,439
you take a look across right so kind of

304
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:14,100
take that wide angle view imagine that

305
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:17,640
first look what's the pattern

306
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:20,339
um if it's a nutrient deficiency it may

307
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:24,539
be across the entire block or the entire

308
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:26,100
you know house or whatever that is

309
00:12:24,539 --> 00:12:27,659
um planting dates when I talk about

310
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,820
block it could be planting date it could

311
00:12:27,659 --> 00:12:31,860
be cultivar it could be a lot of things

312
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:34,200
so but if you look across that entire

313
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:36,600
block a nutrient deficiency can very

314
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:39,300
likely be all of the plants plant

315
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:42,000
diseases are rarely all they're usually

316
00:12:39,299 --> 00:12:43,859
we usually have hot spots

317
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,958
um or if you're on a drip irrigation

318
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:49,440
system and you have an irrigation issue

319
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:51,899
or a fertility issue it there may be

320
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,880
some kind of pattern right

321
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:55,860
um or if it's a cold end of a greenhouse

322
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:58,019
maybe you have an air leak on the cold

323
00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:00,240
end of the greenhouse so you'll start to

324
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:02,459
see kind of patterns

325
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,320
um the lobe into the field the high end

326
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:06,119
of the field the cold part of the

327
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,980
greenhouse where is the heater that

328
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,839
maybe you wouldn't believe how many

329
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:12,778
people have gas powered heaters or

330
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,820
kerosene heaters in their Greenhouse

331
00:13:12,778 --> 00:13:16,379
um or it may be something like if

332
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:20,399
there's a clog in one of the irrigation

333
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:21,958
lines maybe all of row 10 looks

334
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,578
different than the other rows so what is

335
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:25,259
the pattern

336
00:13:23,578 --> 00:13:26,578
um and then you're going to look a

337
00:13:25,259 --> 00:13:28,019
little bit more closely look at the

338
00:13:26,578 --> 00:13:29,759
whole plant

339
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:31,679
um is it the entire plant that's going

340
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:33,480
down is it just the new leaves it's just

341
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:35,399
the old leaves

342
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:38,220
um is it just one side so right a

343
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:39,839
fusarium Wilt just one side will start

344
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:41,820
showing symptoms first so what is the

345
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,440
pattern within the an individual plant

346
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:45,720
you're going to look at multiple plants

347
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,540
but what's going on

348
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:51,240
and from there then then my number three

349
00:13:48,539 --> 00:13:53,219
you go down into the soil or the the

350
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,959
media and you're going to look at Roots

351
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:56,579
you're going to look at the crown what's

352
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:59,399
happening right could it be mechanical

353
00:13:56,578 --> 00:14:02,099
damage rodents for example a lot of

354
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:03,480
rodent issues or or if it was a clogged

355
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:06,180
irrigation system what does the root

356
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:07,860
system look like if it's a root rot

357
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:09,778
issue what do the roots look like so

358
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:11,159
you're going to kind of look there so

359
00:14:09,778 --> 00:14:13,439
you're you're still just gathering

360
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:15,778
information at that point

361
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,240
but you're giving a sweeping look and

362
00:14:15,778 --> 00:14:20,220
you're closing in closing in

363
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,019
and from there from a leaf for example

364
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:24,240
if you have a root rot well then you'll

365
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:25,860
have a leaf die back that's a Wilt right

366
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,240
because if you're losing Roots you're

367
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:29,039
not getting the water and nutrient

368
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:32,339
uptake that you need because the roots

369
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:34,980
aren't there to do to do the job so you

370
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:36,420
might have a Wilt

371
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:38,519
um maybe

372
00:14:36,419 --> 00:14:40,500
um consistently for an entire week or

373
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:42,480
maybe when it cools off at night you'll

374
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:45,778
the plant will recover so there's a kind

375
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:48,240
of Wilt and recover phase or you might

376
00:14:45,778 --> 00:14:50,100
have a marginal Leaf Scorch marginal

377
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,379
Leaf Scorch is an uptake issue that

378
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:55,320
might be a root problem or or maybe salt

379
00:14:52,379 --> 00:14:58,679
buildup in the media so just kind of

380
00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:02,160
gathering it's it's kind of like um

381
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:03,120
it's kind of like a

382
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:06,360
um

383
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:08,940
an investigation if you will right

384
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:11,459
um just eliminating the obvious

385
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:12,959
and if you still keep saying okay I'm

386
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:14,338
still going back to root this is still

387
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:16,439
I'm still thinking there's a root

388
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:18,540
problem well then you can investigate a

389
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,980
little closer or you can say this is a

390
00:15:18,539 --> 00:15:21,958
very clear leaf spot they're fungal

391
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:23,820
structures inside that spot I'm going to

392
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:26,099
go to leaf spot or

393
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:28,019
um a Bud Light you know what is it

394
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:30,720
what's happening so a bud blight

395
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:32,879
generally won't affect the leaves or you

396
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,440
know so it kind of it's kind of putting

397
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:35,159
together

398
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:38,519
um

399
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:40,679
all of that that information so that you

400
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:43,620
can take that first guess but there will

401
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:45,899
be patterns or there will be

402
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:48,120
um hot spots or there will be something

403
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:49,620
to give you more information but it

404
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,899
takes some thought and there's no book

405
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:54,060
there's no checklist

406
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:57,360
um that gets you there you it's

407
00:15:54,059 --> 00:16:01,039
experience and feel but it's also

408
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,039
taking that wide-angle look

409
00:16:01,379 --> 00:16:06,659
could you

410
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:09,120
if you were on Facebook or Instagram see

411
00:16:06,659 --> 00:16:11,578
a photo of a cannabis plant and be able

412
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:14,399
to diagnose it just from that photo as

413
00:16:11,578 --> 00:16:16,138
having fusarium or I mean powdery mildew

414
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,419
I guess is probably an easy one Pottery

415
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:19,860
build is the only easy one okay so

416
00:16:18,419 --> 00:16:21,299
that's my question because I see this

417
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:23,579
all the time where you're like you'll

418
00:16:21,299 --> 00:16:27,059
see people post photos and they're like

419
00:16:23,578 --> 00:16:30,000
oh that's fusarium Oh that's phytoptera

420
00:16:27,059 --> 00:16:31,919
oh you know whatever what

421
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,980
what are your thoughts on that you know

422
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:37,679
just as a pathologist

423
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:40,339
um besides uh there are very few

424
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:40,338
pathogens that

425
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:45,360
seeing the symptoms

426
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:47,518
um if we are going to communicate for

427
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,500
example you and I are very far apart so

428
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:51,060
if you called me I would say send me

429
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:53,220
five pictures I want to see the whole

430
00:16:51,059 --> 00:16:54,958
Greenhouse I want to see the entire site

431
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:57,600
I want you to look for patterns for me

432
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:59,338
right you have to be my eyes

433
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,620
um so sending photographs and just

434
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:03,660
trying to narrow it down in exactly that

435
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:05,459
pattern of thought that thought process

436
00:17:03,659 --> 00:17:09,298
that I just laid out

437
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:12,179
um to show me one leave rarely

438
00:17:09,298 --> 00:17:14,879
um to show me one plant rarely there's

439
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:16,559
more to the story if it was a fusarium

440
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,720
Wilt for example I would make you cut

441
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:20,099
into that stem

442
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,199
um I would make you cut into healthy

443
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:24,240
plant stems I would make you tell me the

444
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:26,400
history of that site I would make you

445
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:29,339
tell me a lot of things but until I saw

446
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:31,620
those spores I would not especially in a

447
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:35,779
commercial in a commercial setting tell

448
00:17:31,619 --> 00:17:35,779
you that you have a specific disease

449
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:42,959
if I have a Jeweler's Loop for example

450
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:44,819
or I don't know if you're familiar with

451
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,279
the dino light it's a little fancier yes

452
00:17:44,819 --> 00:17:50,159
I have Dino Lights I've got Pro Scopes

453
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:51,839
I've gotta okay I've got it all I have a

454
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,460
Dyno light too so what let's just go

455
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:55,619
with dynolite because that's kind of a

456
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:58,200
little bit better than a Jeweler's Loop

457
00:17:55,619 --> 00:18:01,079
if I was a grower with a dino light uh

458
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:04,500
what could I what diseases could I

459
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:07,139
identify with that tool okay on my plan

460
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,900
okay so for you Growers who don't know a

461
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:12,380
Dyno light is a

462
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:15,480
powered little handheld microscope

463
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:16,559
magnification can get pretty good

464
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,079
um

465
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:20,579
so you can see a fungal structure like a

466
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:23,159
pygmodium

467
00:18:20,579 --> 00:18:24,779
um so septoria leaf spot is an example

468
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:27,419
and if anybody wants to just Google

469
00:18:24,779 --> 00:18:30,058
septoria leaf spot just right right up

470
00:18:27,419 --> 00:18:32,520
on their computer as they listen to this

471
00:18:30,058 --> 00:18:35,759
um inside that leaf spot that fungus

472
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:37,440
will produce a a structure a survival

473
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:39,058
structure called it

474
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:42,000
um picnidium

475
00:18:39,058 --> 00:18:44,339
magnetia are like capsules okay they the

476
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,740
size of a black pepper flake and they're

477
00:18:44,339 --> 00:18:49,379
raised like little pimple-like rays and

478
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:50,700
inside are those microscopic spores

479
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,480
but

480
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,819
um

481
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:55,740
pignettia are very large I say very

482
00:18:53,819 --> 00:18:58,500
large so from from a pathologist

483
00:18:55,740 --> 00:19:01,259
standpoint they're very large

484
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:03,538
um young eyes can see them without uh

485
00:19:01,259 --> 00:19:05,700
without a Jeweler's Loop right without a

486
00:19:03,538 --> 00:19:08,279
hand lens but

487
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:11,038
um if you zoom in to some of those those

488
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:13,678
types of spots you can see Canadia and

489
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:16,440
Canadia Force Canadia or asexual spores

490
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:18,240
and they stand up on little stalks

491
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:20,160
the stalks are called the Canadia four

492
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,720
and the Canadian will be on the end

493
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,840
and they'll cluster they'll look like

494
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:26,819
maybe little bristles and so with a with

495
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:28,379
a dino light or even a Jeweler's Loop

496
00:19:26,819 --> 00:19:31,619
and good sunshine

497
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:33,960
you can see those structures and over

498
00:19:31,619 --> 00:19:35,819
time you become familiar with the same

499
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:39,360
ones over and over

500
00:19:35,819 --> 00:19:41,759
um you can't put me in a um in a wheat

501
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:43,558
field and I'll be able to use my Loop to

502
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:45,058
identify certain structures you become

503
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:46,740
trained

504
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:50,940
um with the things that you see over and

505
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:52,140
over but if it's a fungal disease and it

506
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:54,720
sporulates

507
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:56,400
we can usually see enough that I can

508
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,200
take a guess

509
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:01,259
and we can Circle back to this in a

510
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:02,880
minute but your question was when does a

511
00:20:01,259 --> 00:20:04,679
what does a grower do in the meantime

512
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,559
and we could double back to that so

513
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:10,200
usually if I see enough we can give a

514
00:20:07,558 --> 00:20:12,418
grower some guidance until we get that

515
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:14,340
confirmation from the lab

516
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:16,340
um but there are there are fungal

517
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:20,159
structures you can never see bacterial

518
00:20:16,339 --> 00:20:22,319
cells with a dino light uh but you can

519
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:25,259
see oozing you can see water soaking you

520
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:28,200
will never see viruses viruses are the

521
00:20:25,259 --> 00:20:31,160
absolute hardest even symptom-wise it's

522
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,160
very hard to guess

523
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:35,640
um but even with a dino light you can

524
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:37,019
see things like a um like a root

525
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,700
infection

526
00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:40,500
um you can see where that infection

527
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:42,779
might have taken place pythium for

528
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:45,839
instance pythium root rot that pythium

529
00:20:42,779 --> 00:20:49,139
will infect from the root tips whereas

530
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:51,599
black root rot you'll see lesions within

531
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:53,100
the uh within the root along the root

532
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:55,859
you'll see those lesions those small

533
00:20:53,099 --> 00:20:57,719
lesions there lesion nematode is another

534
00:20:55,859 --> 00:20:59,579
one right a lesion nematode kind of goes

535
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:01,740
in right to the side of the root and

536
00:20:59,579 --> 00:21:04,619
it'll create a small lesion so we can

537
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:06,359
see those kinds of things and remember I

538
00:21:04,619 --> 00:21:09,058
was talking about narrowing down from

539
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:12,240
the field level you can also narrow down

540
00:21:09,058 --> 00:21:14,579
when you're at that magnified level even

541
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,859
if it's not a high-powered microscope

542
00:21:14,579 --> 00:21:20,159
from even that hand lens or Dino light

543
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:23,519
level you can start narrowing down

544
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:26,640
um okay root tips or okay

545
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:29,519
um this this flower blight is is on the

546
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:32,580
calyx or sorry on the brat

547
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:35,220
um or on the pedestal like where is it

548
00:21:32,579 --> 00:21:37,619
happening and magnification gets you

549
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:40,019
closer to those things it's a better

550
00:21:37,619 --> 00:21:42,479
it's a better communication for you and

551
00:21:40,019 --> 00:21:44,158
I so that when you do submit that sample

552
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,960
you get the right sample and then of

553
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:49,080
course we can help you with a management

554
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:51,380
strategy until we get that confirmation

555
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:51,379
back

556
00:21:52,619 --> 00:21:58,139
so I mean I kind of want to we could go

557
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:01,080
one of two ways here I kind of want to

558
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:03,179
talk about some of these diseases and

559
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:04,740
their life cycles but I also want to

560
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:08,340
talk about treatment options because

561
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:09,359
like the first thing when you say uh you

562
00:22:08,339 --> 00:22:11,399
know when I think of a lot of these

563
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:14,219
things that are on the leaf surface I

564
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:16,919
want to spray something like ceph oil X

565
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:19,740
like a mineral oil based some sort of

566
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:21,000
oil-based suffocate

567
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:23,819
um

568
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:28,440
are there better options that are safe

569
00:22:23,819 --> 00:22:30,418
and approved in cannabis than that

570
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:33,298
um or is there something how do you

571
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:35,820
approach that I guess

572
00:22:33,298 --> 00:22:38,879
in a really difficult position

573
00:22:35,819 --> 00:22:42,298
um with cannabis because the

574
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,980
the products that are out there are

575
00:22:42,298 --> 00:22:45,599
they're new to cannabis they're new to

576
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:49,079
these production systems they're just

577
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:51,538
new and also in cannabis there's a lot

578
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:52,980
of misinformation out there

579
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:54,538
um and and that's why you've got this

580
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:56,579
podcast right that's where I'm working

581
00:22:54,538 --> 00:22:57,960
in this space because there's so much to

582
00:22:56,579 --> 00:23:01,319
do so

583
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:02,880
um but oils are really not good of

584
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:05,279
fungicides

585
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:07,260
um they're they're just not

586
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:10,200
um they're they're great for suffocating

587
00:23:07,259 --> 00:23:11,819
a lot of arthropods but they're not

588
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:14,519
something I would ever list in my

589
00:23:11,819 --> 00:23:16,558
fungicide Arsenal

590
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:17,099
um there are a lot of

591
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:20,940
um

592
00:23:17,099 --> 00:23:23,759
there are a lot of uh Biologicals that

593
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:25,860
are really just starting to to we're

594
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:27,658
just starting to understand them right

595
00:23:25,859 --> 00:23:30,779
you've got your bacillus products your

596
00:23:27,659 --> 00:23:32,400
trichodermas the eulocadium

597
00:23:30,779 --> 00:23:35,099
um so we're just starting to see some of

598
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:37,559
these products come on the market

599
00:23:35,099 --> 00:23:39,538
um and really I am really loving a lot

600
00:23:37,558 --> 00:23:41,700
of those bacillus products

601
00:23:39,538 --> 00:23:43,259
um there's some really good ones out

602
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:45,840
there

603
00:23:43,259 --> 00:23:47,158
um and and trichodermas also have their

604
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:51,538
place

605
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:53,659
let me say that we use Biologicals

606
00:23:51,538 --> 00:23:56,759
differently than we use our conventional

607
00:23:53,659 --> 00:23:59,820
fungicides so it's not way for disease

608
00:23:56,759 --> 00:24:02,220
and spray and oh it didn't work

609
00:23:59,819 --> 00:24:04,619
um it's the opposite right you've got to

610
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:06,960
have some preventative preventative

611
00:24:04,619 --> 00:24:08,339
measures and we could we could Circle

612
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,000
back to

613
00:24:08,339 --> 00:24:11,099
um

614
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,140
we can Circle back to cultural practices

615
00:24:11,099 --> 00:24:16,678
but you've got to be able to use these

616
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:18,720
these products as as often living

617
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:21,980
objects right they're either

618
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:25,919
um SARS or they're living

619
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:28,259
organisms so they also need

620
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:31,740
um humidity they also need certain

621
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:33,779
conditions to uh to to survive and to do

622
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:35,099
on that leaf and to do what they need to

623
00:24:33,779 --> 00:24:37,019
do

624
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:38,579
um there are a lot of questions about

625
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:40,200
persistence how long are they on that

626
00:24:38,579 --> 00:24:41,579
leaf right once you spray how long are

627
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,140
they on that leaf or on that flower or

628
00:24:41,579 --> 00:24:45,720
in that soil

629
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:49,440
so there there's a lot to be learned

630
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:51,120
there but um the best things I think we

631
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,159
have on the market or your bacillus

632
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:57,658
products and your trichoderma products

633
00:24:53,159 --> 00:25:00,120
and um I do not have a favorite bacillus

634
00:24:57,659 --> 00:25:03,299
um from what I have tested they really

635
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:05,579
work pretty well all all pretty well

636
00:25:03,298 --> 00:25:07,918
um we've got some research going on ask

637
00:25:05,579 --> 00:25:10,980
me again in a year I hope to have a lot

638
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:13,380
more information but so far what we know

639
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:14,159
they're all kind of right there

640
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:17,520
um

641
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:19,860
doing the best that they can with what

642
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:21,960
we throw at them with a monocultured

643
00:25:19,859 --> 00:25:23,819
system in a very humid indoor

644
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:25,200
environment and uh

645
00:25:23,819 --> 00:25:27,960
you know

646
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:30,480
farmers are abusive we don't treat our

647
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:33,360
plants well so we put a lot we put a lot

648
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:35,400
on it right yeah honestly that surprises

649
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:37,740
me a little bit about oils I I was not

650
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:40,500
aware of that um

651
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:43,380
I I've used the oils

652
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:46,140
because and this is another thing to

653
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:49,440
talk about too is how much are insects

654
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:52,140
and pests spreading disease or pathogens

655
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,400
too around your room and killing you

656
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:54,419
know some of these arthropods like you

657
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:57,179
mentioned

658
00:25:54,419 --> 00:26:00,240
I think could I assume would have some

659
00:25:57,179 --> 00:26:02,640
effect as well on reducing or preventing

660
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,359
disease spread

661
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,640
um

662
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:07,439
I have I haven't had really good success

663
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:10,080
with Biologicals

664
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,460
um once I've identified disease in the

665
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:13,579
room

666
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:16,860
um right it seems like at that point

667
00:26:13,579 --> 00:26:18,178
it's too late I mean

668
00:26:16,859 --> 00:26:19,019
I don't know I would love to hear you

669
00:26:18,179 --> 00:26:20,400
just talk a little more about this

670
00:26:19,019 --> 00:26:21,778
because and I'm thinking in my head I'm

671
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,120
thinking of powdery mildew just to give

672
00:26:21,778 --> 00:26:25,679
you a little more context okay any

673
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:28,558
disease right

674
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:30,720
um so your Biologicals I like to say

675
00:26:28,558 --> 00:26:34,379
they're not a Magic Bullet in any way

676
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:36,839
they are not going to cure nothing cures

677
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:38,880
disease but our conventional fungicides

678
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:41,639
which by the way there are none uh label

679
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:43,799
for any cannabis or hip product

680
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:45,419
um your conventional your conventional

681
00:26:43,798 --> 00:26:46,259
fungicides

682
00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:48,360
um

683
00:26:46,259 --> 00:26:50,278
they're tough right they're really good

684
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:52,918
and they can suppress they're a great

685
00:26:50,278 --> 00:26:55,319
big Band-Aid for two to three weeks and

686
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:57,120
your Biologicals don't do that

687
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:59,220
so your Biologicals must be used

688
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:01,199
preventatively they must be used

689
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:03,659
preventatively and we say the same thing

690
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,819
about our conventional fungicides but

691
00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:08,340
they they have a staying power that

692
00:27:05,819 --> 00:27:11,339
Biologicals don't

693
00:27:08,339 --> 00:27:13,139
um so so if you have a history of a

694
00:27:11,339 --> 00:27:15,298
disease

695
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:18,179
um you must use your Biologicals

696
00:27:15,298 --> 00:27:22,798
preventatively or at the first sign of

697
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:25,259
or first symptom of a disease hands down

698
00:27:22,798 --> 00:27:29,400
um powdery mildew

699
00:27:25,259 --> 00:27:32,519
is powdery mildew is like it's like easy

700
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:34,980
but it's tough like I it's I have I have

701
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:36,960
mixed feelings about that one

702
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:38,519
um with powdery mildew and for those who

703
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,940
don't know what you're looking at is

704
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:43,619
actually the fungus it is a mass of

705
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:45,960
Canadia and Canadian Force right so

706
00:27:43,619 --> 00:27:48,599
those are the the Canadian forests that

707
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:50,880
stalk and then the Canadia or those

708
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:51,899
um Highlander clear

709
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,480
um

710
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:56,100
asexual spores and they form in Chains

711
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,440
so those are chains of spores the

712
00:27:56,099 --> 00:28:01,259
fluffier that Mycelia is

713
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:03,298
the longer those chains of spores are

714
00:28:01,259 --> 00:28:05,579
and they're airborne and what do you do

715
00:28:03,298 --> 00:28:07,619
in an indoor grow you've got fans on so

716
00:28:05,579 --> 00:28:10,079
you're blowing it around

717
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:11,879
um so when you see powdery mildew you've

718
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:13,740
got more spores than you can come than

719
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:15,059
you could possibly count on a single

720
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:18,179
leaf

721
00:28:15,058 --> 00:28:20,278
um just just really high numbers that's

722
00:28:18,179 --> 00:28:21,240
what makes powdery mildew so hard to

723
00:28:20,278 --> 00:28:23,278
manage

724
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:25,679
also remember there are a couple of

725
00:28:23,278 --> 00:28:28,259
different powdery mildews out there and

726
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:30,720
one of them in particular

727
00:28:28,259 --> 00:28:32,700
um it's it's relative humidity it can

728
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:36,659
infect at a relative humidity of about

729
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:38,519
40 that's low that's dry

730
00:28:36,659 --> 00:28:40,620
um so that so this is one of the

731
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:42,418
situations where it's sometimes hard to

732
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:44,219
even use cultural practices for

733
00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:47,880
management

734
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:49,620
is there any human risk with the amount

735
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:51,360
of spores in the air when you do spot

736
00:28:49,619 --> 00:28:52,739
powdery mildew in a room are you would

737
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:54,240
you like go running out of there to put

738
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:56,099
on a mask or is it not something to

739
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,240
worry about that would not be something

740
00:28:56,099 --> 00:28:59,538
to worry about unless you're

741
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:01,319
immunocompromised and if you are

742
00:28:59,538 --> 00:29:03,359
immunocompromised it's really hard to be

743
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:06,359
in any agricultural setting right for

744
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:07,798
just a lot of the things we do

745
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:09,418
um another thing about powdery noodles

746
00:29:07,798 --> 00:29:12,298
can I add one thing about powdery milk

747
00:29:09,419 --> 00:29:14,400
absolutely people don't know is that

748
00:29:12,298 --> 00:29:17,220
powdery mildew the white the nice fluffy

749
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:19,440
white mildew that you see if you will

750
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:23,339
um that is only that's the asexual stage

751
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:25,200
of that uh that fungus and so later in

752
00:29:23,339 --> 00:29:27,058
the season or the end of its life or as

753
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,919
plants begin to finesse it will produce

754
00:29:27,058 --> 00:29:31,980
a different type of structure called a

755
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:33,360
chasmodesia and that is an overwintering

756
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:35,038
capsule

757
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:37,740
um that will that's that's going to

758
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:39,240
initiate that sexual recombination that

759
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:42,298
sexual stage but it's also the

760
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:45,000
overwintering stage in chasmodesia or

761
00:29:42,298 --> 00:29:46,259
like some little

762
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,960
um round

763
00:29:46,259 --> 00:29:51,898
velcro balls like they have appendages

764
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:53,579
and they stick to things so your powdery

765
00:29:51,898 --> 00:29:55,678
mildew is gonna stick it's gonna stick

766
00:29:53,579 --> 00:29:57,839
to anything

767
00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:01,200
um that's that's coarse so any kind of

768
00:29:57,839 --> 00:30:03,658
wood any kind of table legs or any kind

769
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,919
of pots or containers or

770
00:30:03,659 --> 00:30:06,419
um so it's going to stick on everything

771
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:08,460
everywhere

772
00:30:06,419 --> 00:30:11,220
and the field is sticking on the stems

773
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:13,259
and debris and um it's hanging out and

774
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:14,700
once those cosmethesia they're black

775
00:30:13,259 --> 00:30:16,919
they're dark colored that means they're

776
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:18,778
melonized when they're melonized they're

777
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:20,820
UV resistant they are heat tolerant

778
00:30:18,778 --> 00:30:23,579
they're cold tolerant they are fungicide

779
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:25,379
resistant so that is that carryover from

780
00:30:23,579 --> 00:30:27,538
season to season

781
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:29,700
um so following a greenhouse in between

782
00:30:27,538 --> 00:30:32,819
but sanitizing a greenhouse in between

783
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:34,860
crops is really critical if not you're

784
00:30:32,819 --> 00:30:36,898
leaving those cosmetesia in place so

785
00:30:34,859 --> 00:30:38,879
again we're back to that life cycle we

786
00:30:36,898 --> 00:30:41,579
leave those cosmetesia in place each

787
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:43,500
year you've got or each each crop you've

788
00:30:41,579 --> 00:30:47,839
got more and more of that inoculum in

789
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:47,839
place ready to ready to infect

790
00:30:48,778 --> 00:30:53,398
so many questions but let me let me

791
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:55,079
start with a couple so my first question

792
00:30:53,398 --> 00:30:55,619
is

793
00:30:55,079 --> 00:30:58,558
um

794
00:30:55,619 --> 00:31:01,379
how are are the are the powdery mildews

795
00:30:58,558 --> 00:31:04,558
that we're seeing in cannabis also

796
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:07,080
um ones that could be uh

797
00:31:04,558 --> 00:31:09,778
could other plants be carriers whether

798
00:31:07,079 --> 00:31:12,119
those are cover crops squashes I think

799
00:31:09,778 --> 00:31:15,960
of like in my outdoor Garden

800
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:19,158
um that sort of thing and then two uh

801
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:21,298
just so I don't forget my questions uh

802
00:31:19,159 --> 00:31:23,399
Biologicals which you mentioned being

803
00:31:21,298 --> 00:31:24,599
effective are are challenging and that

804
00:31:23,398 --> 00:31:27,719
we can't

805
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:30,240
a lot of states are testing for

806
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:31,880
microbial contamination on the buds

807
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,440
themselves and not differentiating

808
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:36,600
bacillus

809
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:38,519
species in terms of what's safe and not

810
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:39,298
safe so that that's another thing and

811
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:42,079
then

812
00:31:39,298 --> 00:31:44,639
um how effective is just water at

813
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:46,918
killing powdery mildew I've heard that

814
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,778
it can you know there's a physical

815
00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:51,360
mechanism of just rinsing it off the

816
00:31:48,778 --> 00:31:52,500
leaves too potentially so sorry there's

817
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:53,759
a lot of questions but I don't want to

818
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:55,679
forget them I have a lot of questions

819
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:58,140
and that's two hours worth of answers

820
00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:00,360
okay okay

821
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:02,820
so what was the first question now now

822
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:05,939
I've forgotten the first question uh

823
00:32:02,819 --> 00:32:07,379
other carriers that's right cross

824
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:10,380
species

825
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:12,360
contamination so what we finding and

826
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:13,799
back to speciation and my my favorite

827
00:32:12,359 --> 00:32:16,439
thing in the world to speciate

828
00:32:13,798 --> 00:32:18,418
everything is that um our powdery

829
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:20,820
mildews basically do have a wider hose

830
00:32:18,419 --> 00:32:22,700
range than we have than we have known in

831
00:32:20,819 --> 00:32:25,139
the past so yes

832
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:28,019
golovenomyces chicory Sierra morgola

833
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:31,020
venomyces spodacious

834
00:32:28,019 --> 00:32:33,778
um absolutely is the one that you're

835
00:32:31,019 --> 00:32:38,099
gonna see on wildflowers on Weeds on

836
00:32:33,778 --> 00:32:39,359
other crops it is out there yes

837
00:32:38,099 --> 00:32:42,240
um so

838
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:43,798
um do you always see the weeds like I'm

839
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,538
picturing indoor facilities that run

840
00:32:43,798 --> 00:32:48,480
cover crops

841
00:32:45,538 --> 00:32:50,460
um inside the facility itself like you

842
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,740
know some of these cover crops have very

843
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:54,298
narrow leaves they're smaller

844
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:55,980
um you'd have to look really closely is

845
00:32:54,298 --> 00:32:58,079
it possible that you may not be seeing

846
00:32:55,980 --> 00:33:00,360
the spores or um

847
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:02,639
or something like that too I guess

848
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:04,819
yeah so so it manifests differently

849
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:08,220
sometimes it's not as preferred host

850
00:33:04,819 --> 00:33:10,918
sometimes it um you know and so it will

851
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:12,538
look differently also

852
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:13,980
um you know again so we've got a lot of

853
00:33:12,538 --> 00:33:16,558
levels and you and I were talking about

854
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:18,960
this last week you've got a lot of

855
00:33:16,558 --> 00:33:20,940
different types of Growers right and

856
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:23,940
your listeners are probably in a very

857
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:26,519
wide range from um two plants on the

858
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:29,460
black on the back patio to a commercial

859
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:32,278
facility that is sealed

860
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:35,100
um but even in your larger facilities

861
00:33:32,278 --> 00:33:37,440
you would be surprised at how much

862
00:33:35,099 --> 00:33:40,558
outdoor air is coming in

863
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:43,019
so remember the fluffiness remember

864
00:33:40,558 --> 00:33:46,798
everything you see in powdery mildew is

865
00:33:43,019 --> 00:33:48,778
spores is my their microscopic spores so

866
00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:52,319
there's a lot of powdery mildew blowing

867
00:33:48,778 --> 00:33:55,740
around and so just air exchange through

868
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:59,460
a fan through an open window through a

869
00:33:55,740 --> 00:34:02,460
some type of ventilation system

870
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:06,240
bringing that powdery mildew in

871
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:08,878
so and again once it's in there it's

872
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:11,280
there for a very long time

873
00:34:08,878 --> 00:34:13,618
and I I'm gonna laugh and I'm gonna tell

874
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:16,879
you that this pathologist cannot get rid

875
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:20,519
of pottery mildew in her own Greenhouse

876
00:34:16,878 --> 00:34:23,579
we have just infested we have done

877
00:34:20,519 --> 00:34:27,239
everything and we can't get it we cannot

878
00:34:23,579 --> 00:34:30,598
eradicate it so it is tough

879
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:32,579
um it is really tough so think about the

880
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:34,500
entry it is coming in and then it's

881
00:34:32,579 --> 00:34:36,779
building up so once you have powdery

882
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:39,239
mildew which everybody does once you

883
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:41,040
have powdery mildew if you you know how

884
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:43,138
many of us are guilty about after we

885
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:44,759
Harvest we leave the plants in place

886
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:46,619
right we don't really get rid of them

887
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:48,240
like we should and then so that's when

888
00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:50,159
you start seeing those cosmetesia

889
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:52,158
develop you might not see them but

890
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:54,539
they're there and

891
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:57,480
go ahead can it only grow on living

892
00:34:54,539 --> 00:35:02,338
tissue powdery mildew powdery mildew can

893
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:04,800
only establish and and survive no live

894
00:35:02,338 --> 00:35:07,320
but it will survive as survival

895
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:10,920
structures so right

896
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:12,539
um but you can go you can go years with

897
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:15,358
those cosmethesia those survival

898
00:35:12,539 --> 00:35:17,838
structures being viable and waiting for

899
00:35:15,358 --> 00:35:17,838
a crop

900
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:24,019
yeah I'm full of bad news right

901
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:27,539
so

902
00:35:24,019 --> 00:35:31,338
distilling the soil have any positive

903
00:35:27,539 --> 00:35:34,940
effects in terms of potentially killing

904
00:35:31,338 --> 00:35:38,279
the chasmodesia is that the correct word

905
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:40,980
yeah yeah that's right it's usually

906
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:43,440
somewhere on some surface it's it's not

907
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:45,719
as much on this on the soil or in the

908
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:48,300
soil so tilling it into debris tilling

909
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:50,459
the debris in yes that will bury it but

910
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:53,460
it's in other places right so if you

911
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:56,519
have a hemp field it's on fence posts if

912
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:58,740
or you know it's clinging to anything

913
00:35:56,519 --> 00:36:00,358
um it's clinging everywhere and there's

914
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:02,219
always some debris there's always

915
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:04,078
something around but in an indoor

916
00:36:02,219 --> 00:36:07,439
facility

917
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:12,119
um I don't know any grower who truly

918
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:14,880
does a full disinfestation between crops

919
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:17,400
I mean wash floor to ceiling

920
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,780
so mer filters though can be effective

921
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:21,720
at reducing that or is that getting

922
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:24,720
outside of your area of that's getting

923
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:27,000
outside of my area but your um your

924
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:29,159
filter size your uh will affect you know

925
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,380
it determines which particle size gets

926
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:34,279
in but you still have to walk in right

927
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:37,500
and again the best facilities

928
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:38,760
are are rare

929
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:41,460
um so

930
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:43,140
not just filtration but opening of doors

931
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:44,940
and you walk in right you've been

932
00:36:43,139 --> 00:36:46,858
outside and you walk straight into work

933
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:50,159
during the day do you really suit up do

934
00:36:46,858 --> 00:36:53,400
you really shower I mean not many even

935
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:55,679
our best grows are not uh not the level

936
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:58,079
of a containment facility it's going to

937
00:36:55,679 --> 00:37:02,419
come in and once it's in

938
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:02,420
it's very it's going to establish

939
00:37:02,699 --> 00:37:06,960
yeah no that's that's really helpful

940
00:37:05,219 --> 00:37:09,539
um

941
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,740
so I I guess what I'm wondering then is

942
00:37:09,539 --> 00:37:12,719
you know we talked a little bit about

943
00:37:10,739 --> 00:37:14,039
these Biologicals and how in a lot of

944
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:17,459
States we have testing that doesn't

945
00:37:14,039 --> 00:37:21,539
allow us to effectively use them because

946
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:23,460
of the the regulations essentially

947
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:25,619
um

948
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:27,358
which leads me back to oils and then my

949
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:28,559
question about water and sort of

950
00:37:27,358 --> 00:37:31,380
mechanical

951
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:33,000
means of removing powdery mildew how

952
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:34,858
effective are those things

953
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,719
say in the vegetative state before we

954
00:37:34,858 --> 00:37:38,279
have the formation and the flower

955
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:40,500
formation

956
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:42,960
oh wow okay I'm gonna start with your

957
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:46,139
second question uh water

958
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:48,980
so think about how powdery mildew

959
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:52,139
infects so the um

960
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:55,139
so this is a cuticle infection so the

961
00:37:52,139 --> 00:37:57,539
infection is right under the cuticle so

962
00:37:55,139 --> 00:37:59,699
it is not literally on the surface so

963
00:37:57,539 --> 00:38:02,219
the sporulation is on the surface but

964
00:37:59,699 --> 00:38:05,460
there is a there's a level of infection

965
00:38:02,219 --> 00:38:07,858
so if you wash it down you have spread

966
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:09,659
those spores and then you have not

967
00:38:07,858 --> 00:38:12,239
gotten rid of the infection so the

968
00:38:09,659 --> 00:38:15,000
fungus will pop back up so

969
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:18,019
I would not I would not waste my time I

970
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:21,780
don't see where that could even

971
00:38:18,019 --> 00:38:26,119
buy you any time like 12 hours but

972
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:26,119
powdery mildew sporulates right back

973
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:31,200
if you have a missed bench for example

974
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:33,599
if you have cuttings and you have a Mist

975
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:35,098
bench yeah powdery mildew is not real

976
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:37,260
happy

977
00:38:35,099 --> 00:38:39,539
um but you know you haven't gotten rid

978
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:42,599
of the infection you just kept it kept

979
00:38:39,539 --> 00:38:45,179
it at Bay for however long your plants

980
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:47,940
are under the Mist

981
00:38:45,179 --> 00:38:51,118
so what tools do we have then as a

982
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:52,559
grower in our current system besides

983
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:55,740
oils I guess we haven't talked about

984
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:57,719
soaps at all

985
00:38:55,739 --> 00:38:58,919
um those are insecticidal soaps or

986
00:38:57,719 --> 00:39:00,659
anything like that do those have any

987
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:03,539
fungicidal properties

988
00:39:00,659 --> 00:39:06,299
not really not enough

989
00:39:03,539 --> 00:39:07,739
um so we've we've got

990
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:10,680
we've got

991
00:39:07,739 --> 00:39:12,358
um I don't like to to mention products

992
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:15,480
but there are a couple of products on

993
00:39:12,358 --> 00:39:18,179
the market that do a pretty good job and

994
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:19,199
um regalia does a good job

995
00:39:18,179 --> 00:39:22,739
um

996
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:26,219
um I have a study that we use cease

997
00:39:22,739 --> 00:39:28,019
which is a bacillus so uh cease does a

998
00:39:26,219 --> 00:39:28,858
good a good job

999
00:39:28,019 --> 00:39:31,858
um

1000
00:39:28,858 --> 00:39:33,719
used properly with other cultural

1001
00:39:31,858 --> 00:39:36,480
practices

1002
00:39:33,719 --> 00:39:39,239
um that's kind of been our best bet and

1003
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:42,539
if you look at some of my old work

1004
00:39:39,239 --> 00:39:45,179
um a student did a project several years

1005
00:39:42,539 --> 00:39:48,059
ago where one of our Growers had to use

1006
00:39:45,179 --> 00:39:51,179
organic milk and uh he did and that was

1007
00:39:48,059 --> 00:39:54,119
one of the most effective but again

1008
00:39:51,179 --> 00:39:57,299
um you need a lot of applications right

1009
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:59,760
so it's not just one uh one application

1010
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:01,920
like most Growers especially any grower

1011
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:04,079
who goes from a conventional system into

1012
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:06,240
something like cannabis that you can't

1013
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:08,280
use conventional products they're highly

1014
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:08,819
disappointed but

1015
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:12,119
um

1016
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:14,220
there are some products that work well

1017
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:17,640
um when combined with cultural practices

1018
00:40:14,219 --> 00:40:20,219
when combined with air circulation and

1019
00:40:17,639 --> 00:40:23,159
following greenhouses in between crops

1020
00:40:20,219 --> 00:40:26,279
those types of things

1021
00:40:23,159 --> 00:40:27,719
so I heard about that a study like that

1022
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:30,540
um through the giant pumpkin Community

1023
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:32,519
actually I wonder if this was if your

1024
00:40:30,539 --> 00:40:34,559
student and you were the ones that did

1025
00:40:32,519 --> 00:40:37,199
that original study or were you guys

1026
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:40,199
replicated something around that no we

1027
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:42,358
just did it uh we did it when we were uh

1028
00:40:40,199 --> 00:40:46,078
looking at some products in powdery

1029
00:40:42,358 --> 00:40:48,480
mildew in hemp in the greenhouse and uh

1030
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:50,579
you know we we had all kinds of crazy

1031
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,920
things in that study anything a grower

1032
00:40:50,579 --> 00:40:54,780
told us they used all the you know the

1033
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:56,940
anecdotes and

1034
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:59,280
um wives tales we kind of threw those in

1035
00:40:56,940 --> 00:41:00,838
there so we had B propolis and we had

1036
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:03,540
all kinds of things

1037
00:41:00,838 --> 00:41:07,078
um but the milk the organic whole milk

1038
00:41:03,539 --> 00:41:08,820
and it was a powdered milk mixed I don't

1039
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:13,160
remember the details of the study but it

1040
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:13,160
did pretty well so it uh

1041
00:41:13,219 --> 00:41:19,679
that's not systemic you're going to have

1042
00:41:16,139 --> 00:41:21,598
to spray on a five-day interval

1043
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:23,338
oh that's that's a good point then okay

1044
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:26,039
so every five days just because of the

1045
00:41:23,338 --> 00:41:27,960
life cycle of the yeah of the mildew so

1046
00:41:26,039 --> 00:41:29,460
do you know if it was an enzyme or

1047
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:31,079
something in the milk itself or the

1048
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:32,880
lactobacillus because I know a lot of

1049
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:34,320
Growers are using lactobacillus and

1050
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,838
making their own

1051
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:40,200
what they call Labs essentially and

1052
00:41:36,838 --> 00:41:42,719
spraying that I don't remember

1053
00:41:40,199 --> 00:41:45,419
um it's not something I pursued I did

1054
00:41:42,719 --> 00:41:47,399
some powdery mildew work years ago I've

1055
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:49,680
since worked on other things so I don't

1056
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:51,599
remember the details of that study I'll

1057
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:53,519
see if I can find it if I can find it

1058
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:57,180
I'll give it to you to link to your uh

1059
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:59,699
your bio and your uh show notes but um

1060
00:41:57,179 --> 00:42:02,519
but yeah it's a powdery mildew is tough

1061
00:41:59,699 --> 00:42:04,559
especially indoors

1062
00:42:02,519 --> 00:42:06,119
well let's talk a little about what some

1063
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:10,078
of the other diseases are that you're

1064
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:11,880
seeing uh prevalence of and maybe how

1065
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:14,460
they're misunderstood or misdiagnosed

1066
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:16,800
right now

1067
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:19,500
oh wow I could go forever on that all

1068
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:21,539
right so another really common one in

1069
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:23,400
indoor facilities now when I say indoor

1070
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:25,619
that means

1071
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:27,480
um a true and or closed facility it

1072
00:42:25,619 --> 00:42:29,519
could mean a greenhouse it could mean a

1073
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:31,260
basement it can mean anything except the

1074
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:33,599
field okay so I'm going to use that term

1075
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:34,740
very generally but any indoor

1076
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:38,160
environment

1077
00:42:34,739 --> 00:42:41,098
where you're using a soilless media

1078
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:43,559
the premise the premise there and now

1079
00:42:41,099 --> 00:42:46,260
this can also include Hydroponics or

1080
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:49,980
anything in that line as well

1081
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:51,540
um it's pretty we'll call it sterile uh

1082
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:53,460
for lack of a better term

1083
00:42:51,539 --> 00:42:56,460
um so you don't have the antagonist you

1084
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:58,380
don't have the the microorganisms that

1085
00:42:56,460 --> 00:43:01,559
you would in a field situation all right

1086
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:06,000
well we'll kind of set the scene there

1087
00:43:01,559 --> 00:43:07,980
um so uh pythium is probably number two

1088
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:11,940
right behind powdery mildew in any

1089
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:15,059
indoor grow any soil is mixed or soil is

1090
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:16,619
um or hydroponic system if you will

1091
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:18,599
and that's because there are no

1092
00:43:16,619 --> 00:43:20,880
antagonists

1093
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:24,420
um also we do a lot of watering in a

1094
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:26,220
soilless mix we're also in it's wet

1095
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:29,220
right we're either flood we're either

1096
00:43:26,219 --> 00:43:32,519
flood benching or we are you know having

1097
00:43:29,219 --> 00:43:34,139
dripping and just just it's just wet in

1098
00:43:32,519 --> 00:43:37,559
an indoor environment because we've got

1099
00:43:34,139 --> 00:43:39,598
pour through and uh pythium

1100
00:43:37,559 --> 00:43:41,400
um is a water mold it's an old Micey

1101
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:44,099
it's not a true fungus

1102
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:46,079
and so once pythium comes in It's Got

1103
00:43:44,099 --> 00:43:48,720
Roots it's got water it doesn't have

1104
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:52,980
antagonists and that's another really

1105
00:43:48,719 --> 00:43:55,439
persistent fungus that is uh or pathogen

1106
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:57,838
rather sorry not it's not a fungus it's

1107
00:43:55,440 --> 00:44:00,300
a really persistent pathogen that a lot

1108
00:43:57,838 --> 00:44:02,759
of Growers struggle with and often fail

1109
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:06,599
to recognize what's really going on

1110
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:09,359
because it manifests as a nutrient

1111
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:11,338
deficiency it manifests as a lot of

1112
00:44:09,358 --> 00:44:13,199
things and

1113
00:44:11,338 --> 00:44:14,818
um of course you get wilting in the more

1114
00:44:13,199 --> 00:44:16,559
you more it wilts the more you water the

1115
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:18,420
more you water the happier pythium is

1116
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:21,358
because it's water mold

1117
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:23,760
um so there's a lot of pythium in our

1118
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:24,420
systems

1119
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,579
um

1120
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:29,700
I know that we have five different

1121
00:44:26,579 --> 00:44:31,800
species that we have identified we've

1122
00:44:29,699 --> 00:44:34,379
got the cool weather pythiums and we've

1123
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:36,960
got the really hot Greenhouse

1124
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:38,880
um pythium species so there are a lot of

1125
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:41,519
pythians out there from across the board

1126
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:43,079
and we're finding lots of it

1127
00:44:41,519 --> 00:44:45,539
um so

1128
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:47,579
just knowing you have pythium would be a

1129
00:44:45,539 --> 00:44:49,679
big deal but to know which one you have

1130
00:44:47,579 --> 00:44:51,359
kind of complicates things unless you

1131
00:44:49,679 --> 00:44:52,858
have a lab that's willing to do that for

1132
00:44:51,358 --> 00:44:54,838
you

1133
00:44:52,858 --> 00:44:58,078
yeah

1134
00:44:54,838 --> 00:44:59,460
so when we uh when we suspect we have

1135
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:01,560
pythium

1136
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:03,599
our identifiers like you said it's going

1137
00:45:01,559 --> 00:45:05,639
to delete the above ground

1138
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:07,680
material is going to look a lot like a

1139
00:45:05,639 --> 00:45:10,259
nutrient deficiency but I would assume

1140
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:12,118
when you dig down into that

1141
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:13,859
media you're going to see a very

1142
00:45:12,119 --> 00:45:15,059
distinctive I mean I've always called it

1143
00:45:13,858 --> 00:45:17,759
root rot

1144
00:45:15,059 --> 00:45:19,858
um sort of brown slimy

1145
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:21,660
Roots what what are the distinguishing

1146
00:45:19,858 --> 00:45:25,259
characteristics epithium relative to

1147
00:45:21,659 --> 00:45:27,659
other pathogens okay so

1148
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:30,300
um for everybody listening when you when

1149
00:45:27,659 --> 00:45:31,318
you expose those roots rinse very slowly

1150
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:32,760
right you don't want to break those

1151
00:45:31,318 --> 00:45:34,679
roots those roots are really brittle

1152
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:36,960
when they're infected

1153
00:45:34,679 --> 00:45:39,179
so your younger younger plants are going

1154
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:40,800
to become infected more they're more

1155
00:45:39,179 --> 00:45:42,358
susceptible

1156
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:44,700
um a young plant like right a new

1157
00:45:42,358 --> 00:45:46,739
cutting or a Seedling or just a young

1158
00:45:44,699 --> 00:45:48,299
plant has more of those young tender

1159
00:45:46,739 --> 00:45:48,959
Roots

1160
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:50,700
um

1161
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,318
they're more susceptible the older a

1162
00:45:50,699 --> 00:45:53,699
plant is the less the less problem

1163
00:45:52,318 --> 00:45:55,139
you're going to have with pythium so

1164
00:45:53,699 --> 00:45:56,818
it's an early season disease so think

1165
00:45:55,139 --> 00:46:00,118
about timing

1166
00:45:56,818 --> 00:46:03,059
um whereas nutrition is usually a

1167
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:04,200
problem later in the growth the growing

1168
00:46:03,059 --> 00:46:06,960
cycle

1169
00:46:04,199 --> 00:46:09,299
pythium is a root Nibbler so it comes in

1170
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:11,818
on the root tip so the very tips and it

1171
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:13,859
goes upwards and once Roots get tough

1172
00:46:11,818 --> 00:46:14,940
and strong yeah it doesn't really like

1173
00:46:13,858 --> 00:46:16,500
that

1174
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:18,960
um so you'll see them more on the tip

1175
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:21,000
and if you rinse slowly and you take a

1176
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:23,400
look at those roots so you're saying

1177
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,559
Brown and mushy that's extreme you want

1178
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:27,900
to catch it before that right so with

1179
00:46:25,559 --> 00:46:30,599
that extreme you got stunting and dying

1180
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:32,519
and but whereas if it's a if it's that

1181
00:46:30,599 --> 00:46:33,800
the beginning stages and you've just got

1182
00:46:32,519 --> 00:46:37,079
that

1183
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:39,060
myoclerosis or maybe it's stunting maybe

1184
00:46:37,079 --> 00:46:41,220
it's not I'm not real sure could it be

1185
00:46:39,059 --> 00:46:42,539
the cultivar so when it's when it's at

1186
00:46:41,219 --> 00:46:44,399
that low level

1187
00:46:42,539 --> 00:46:45,719
looking at those roots so you want to

1188
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,760
look at the tips of the roots with your

1189
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:49,858
Dino light or your hand lens or whatever

1190
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:51,780
you have to magnify

1191
00:46:49,858 --> 00:46:53,639
um I know some of my Growers who have an

1192
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:54,960
old-fashioned magnifying glass don't be

1193
00:46:53,639 --> 00:46:57,659
too proud for a magnifying glass

1194
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:59,880
whatever it takes to magnify

1195
00:46:57,659 --> 00:47:01,379
and so what you want to look at is the

1196
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:05,400
root tip

1197
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:07,380
the root of an effective infected root

1198
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:09,539
will be flatter it won't be really

1199
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:11,818
turgid it'll be discolored not

1200
00:47:09,539 --> 00:47:13,920
necessarily brown maybe starting to turn

1201
00:47:11,818 --> 00:47:15,779
a little gray

1202
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:19,380
um and at the tip

1203
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:22,200
very easily the cortex will Slough off

1204
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:25,920
and just that steel will stick out

1205
00:47:22,199 --> 00:47:29,879
so we call that rat tail so a rat tail

1206
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:32,300
root tip is my favorite indicator of

1207
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:32,300
pythium

1208
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:34,440
so

1209
00:47:33,719 --> 00:47:36,179
um

1210
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:38,460
picture again

1211
00:47:36,179 --> 00:47:40,858
the cortex left off and just the steel

1212
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:42,539
sticking out sometimes it's a very small

1213
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:44,219
amount sometimes maybe as much as an

1214
00:47:42,539 --> 00:47:46,019
inch but you have to rinse your roots

1215
00:47:44,219 --> 00:47:48,239
very carefully so you don't break them

1216
00:47:46,019 --> 00:47:50,159
up and you can see those sometimes with

1217
00:47:48,239 --> 00:47:51,539
the naked eye the older I get the less

1218
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:53,940
of the seeing things with the naked eye

1219
00:47:51,539 --> 00:47:56,099
are possible but a little bit of

1220
00:47:53,940 --> 00:48:00,358
magnification heck turn on your phone

1221
00:47:56,099 --> 00:48:03,119
camera and zoom it's usually enough

1222
00:48:00,358 --> 00:48:06,659
so if I spot pythium on

1223
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:08,220
my plants they're they're looking you

1224
00:48:06,659 --> 00:48:10,139
know like you said you caught it in

1225
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:11,759
early stage Wheat Growers tend to

1226
00:48:10,139 --> 00:48:14,098
diagnose these things probably too late

1227
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:18,359
but assuming we caught it early what

1228
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:19,680
what options do we have to for treatment

1229
00:48:18,358 --> 00:48:21,539
oh

1230
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:23,460
bad news again

1231
00:48:21,539 --> 00:48:25,858
um so some of your trichoderma products

1232
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:27,599
are good preventatives so let's back up

1233
00:48:25,858 --> 00:48:29,219
if you ever have pythium in your

1234
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:30,838
Greenhouse you probably still have

1235
00:48:29,219 --> 00:48:32,578
pythium and I'm saying Greenhouse your

1236
00:48:30,838 --> 00:48:34,980
indoor environment you probably still

1237
00:48:32,579 --> 00:48:37,019
have pythium

1238
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:39,838
um again following starting over

1239
00:48:37,019 --> 00:48:42,358
Cleaning Santa disinfesting sanitizing

1240
00:48:39,838 --> 00:48:44,219
everything every tool every piece of

1241
00:48:42,358 --> 00:48:46,739
equipment from wheelbarrow to garden

1242
00:48:44,219 --> 00:48:48,239
hose to Flushing out your irrigation

1243
00:48:46,739 --> 00:48:49,739
lines

1244
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:52,439
um cleaning everything out and starting

1245
00:48:49,739 --> 00:48:54,479
from scratch making sure that when you

1246
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:56,700
get a delivery of your media you're not

1247
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:58,500
throwing it on the ground outside

1248
00:48:56,699 --> 00:49:01,559
surprising how many people do that so

1249
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:03,900
then your media becomes contaminated but

1250
00:49:01,559 --> 00:49:06,539
um so to go in and if you have a history

1251
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:08,519
to go with something like a trichoderma

1252
00:49:06,539 --> 00:49:10,139
or something like that so really you

1253
00:49:08,519 --> 00:49:12,300
want to get those plants to that six

1254
00:49:10,139 --> 00:49:14,159
week stage and once you get to that six

1255
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:15,839
or eight week stage they toughen up and

1256
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:19,259
they're pretty good unless you really

1257
00:49:15,838 --> 00:49:22,259
have a severe infestation

1258
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:24,780
pantheum is a soil-borne pathogen it

1259
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:27,480
lives its entire life in the soil which

1260
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:29,640
means at any propagule any Spore is

1261
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:32,159
going to move with soil and when I say

1262
00:49:29,639 --> 00:49:34,259
soil I mean soil and soil is mixed and

1263
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:36,598
water so it's moving it's moving

1264
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:38,400
anywhere that soil particles would so

1265
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:40,140
it's under your shoes it's on your hands

1266
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:42,420
if your hands are wet it's on your wet

1267
00:49:40,139 --> 00:49:44,940
pruners it's um well you wet clothes

1268
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:47,760
it's definitely under the bench on the

1269
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:49,858
ground any crack in the in the concrete

1270
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:51,359
under there so it's everywhere and

1271
00:49:49,858 --> 00:49:53,299
you're moving it around you're moving it

1272
00:49:51,358 --> 00:49:56,639
very easily

1273
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:58,859
ones for rarely we'll we'll set off an

1274
00:49:56,639 --> 00:50:01,799
epidemic but there's rarely one sport

1275
00:49:58,858 --> 00:50:03,900
and then of course once you add a host

1276
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:05,640
plant that's highly susceptible and then

1277
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:08,460
you add all that water because it's a

1278
00:50:05,639 --> 00:50:11,759
water mold remember then you've got that

1279
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:13,920
slow build up of inoculum and then

1280
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:15,780
suddenly bam you're hit with a disease

1281
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:18,838
epidemic you're like where did this come

1282
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:21,960
from but it slowly Creeps in

1283
00:50:18,838 --> 00:50:24,480
um so sanitation sanitation sanitation

1284
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:29,159
there's nothing you can do no perfect

1285
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:31,260
fungicide will do a good job without

1286
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:33,899
sanitation and being we don't have a

1287
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:35,160
good fungicide sanitation is all we've

1288
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:37,800
got

1289
00:50:35,159 --> 00:50:40,379
okay yeah because we we do work with a

1290
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:42,420
lot of Growers that are using soils that

1291
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:44,640
have a compost fraction they're they're

1292
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:45,480
using more biological so we do have I I

1293
00:50:44,639 --> 00:50:48,539
guess what you said like more

1294
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:50,219
antagonisms too pythium and frankly I

1295
00:50:48,539 --> 00:50:51,239
haven't seen a lot of pythium and with a

1296
00:50:50,219 --> 00:50:55,500
lot of the grows that we work with

1297
00:50:51,239 --> 00:50:56,699
relative to other other diseases but

1298
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:59,639
um

1299
00:50:56,699 --> 00:51:01,618
if we want to reuse that media for

1300
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:06,078
example if we were growing in a in a bed

1301
00:51:01,619 --> 00:51:09,180
versus a disposable media

1302
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:11,760
would repeat applications of trichoderma

1303
00:51:09,179 --> 00:51:14,699
or something like that have a potential

1304
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:18,020
the potential to at least reduce it

1305
00:51:14,699 --> 00:51:18,019
below an economic threshold

1306
00:51:18,179 --> 00:51:21,480
um I really don't want to say yes to

1307
00:51:20,519 --> 00:51:23,539
that

1308
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:23,539
um

1309
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:28,319
if you

1310
00:51:26,159 --> 00:51:31,078
I'd rather see you steam it or or

1311
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:33,420
somehow sterilize it right somehow

1312
00:51:31,079 --> 00:51:35,640
heated them I'd much rather see you do

1313
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:38,280
that with anything in a great house

1314
00:51:35,639 --> 00:51:40,858
think of a hospital a hospital is quote

1315
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:43,140
unquote sterile that's how staff kind of

1316
00:51:40,858 --> 00:51:46,920
takes a hold or or something else in a

1317
00:51:43,139 --> 00:51:48,719
hospital right uh that's what happens is

1318
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:50,880
those antagonists are not there so even

1319
00:51:48,719 --> 00:51:52,980
if you've got some compost in your media

1320
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:55,079
you still don't have the antagonist

1321
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:56,880
utils don't have have the biodiversity

1322
00:51:55,079 --> 00:51:58,559
that you have out in the field that's

1323
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:00,420
why you don't see a lot of these

1324
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:02,400
problems in fields you see different

1325
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:05,220
things but that's why you really don't

1326
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:08,818
have a lot of these in the field because

1327
00:52:05,219 --> 00:52:10,618
um you've got really a an entire uh

1328
00:52:08,818 --> 00:52:13,679
ecosystem you're never going to create

1329
00:52:10,619 --> 00:52:15,480
an ecosystem in an indoor environment so

1330
00:52:13,679 --> 00:52:18,419
you've got to keep it

1331
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:20,519
on the sterile end

1332
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:21,838
um don't reuse your media if you do have

1333
00:52:20,519 --> 00:52:24,539
a good steamer

1334
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:25,980
or have something to be able to really

1335
00:52:24,539 --> 00:52:26,639
heat it up

1336
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:29,760
um

1337
00:52:26,639 --> 00:52:33,299
two weeks at

1338
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:36,839
110 degrees Fahrenheit would uh make me

1339
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:39,059
happy but 110 degrees inside of a large

1340
00:52:36,838 --> 00:52:40,318
container is different than 110 on the

1341
00:52:39,059 --> 00:52:44,579
surface

1342
00:52:40,318 --> 00:52:47,119
so why why can't we create uh

1343
00:52:44,579 --> 00:52:50,880
successional functioning ecosystem

1344
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:53,220
in indoors because I know that compost

1345
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:56,358
contains higher

1346
00:52:53,219 --> 00:53:00,659
microbial biomass overall

1347
00:52:56,358 --> 00:53:01,799
it may contain less diversity but I'm

1348
00:53:00,659 --> 00:53:02,578
just curious to hear your thoughts on

1349
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:05,519
that

1350
00:53:02,579 --> 00:53:06,660
oh that's really not my area but think

1351
00:53:05,519 --> 00:53:09,480
about

1352
00:53:06,659 --> 00:53:12,179
think about an ecosystem is underground

1353
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:14,400
at soil level right so it's your

1354
00:53:12,179 --> 00:53:15,539
rhizosphere it's your phylus sphere it's

1355
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:18,300
the

1356
00:53:15,539 --> 00:53:21,838
it's the arthropods in the air it's the

1357
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:23,460
microbes and so it's it's bigger and you

1358
00:53:21,838 --> 00:53:25,380
don't have that in an indoor environment

1359
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:26,039
right

1360
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:28,800
um

1361
00:53:26,039 --> 00:53:30,239
it's not going to be a biodome it's not

1362
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:32,339
you know you would have to really open

1363
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:34,439
up so you can't have like a micro

1364
00:53:32,338 --> 00:53:35,099
ecosystem

1365
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:36,659
um

1366
00:53:35,099 --> 00:53:39,300
alone

1367
00:53:36,659 --> 00:53:41,460
right so if you've got a micro ecosystem

1368
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:43,859
it's happening and the bigger ecosystem

1369
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:47,579
outside but you can't produce a micro

1370
00:53:43,858 --> 00:53:49,739
ecosystem in a container or on a bench

1371
00:53:47,579 --> 00:53:53,220
with the rest of that Greenhouse doesn't

1372
00:53:49,739 --> 00:53:56,539
have that the components needed

1373
00:53:53,219 --> 00:53:56,539
um to support the rest of it

1374
00:53:56,639 --> 00:53:59,818
yeah that's something I've been thinking

1375
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:01,559
about because we have

1376
00:53:59,818 --> 00:54:03,119
well we have Growers that you know want

1377
00:54:01,559 --> 00:54:05,880
to do things that are more organic and

1378
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:08,519
be more natural and and this idea that

1379
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:11,640
things that happen in nature are somehow

1380
00:54:08,519 --> 00:54:13,739
better than other things even though

1381
00:54:11,639 --> 00:54:16,139
agriculture in itself is fairly

1382
00:54:13,739 --> 00:54:18,779
artificial growing monocrops and

1383
00:54:16,139 --> 00:54:20,460
harvesting them so consistently but you

1384
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:22,200
know I some of the facilities we work

1385
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:24,420
with like one of them has had the same

1386
00:54:22,199 --> 00:54:25,618
media in place in in their rooms for

1387
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:27,358
over eight years and I know they've

1388
00:54:25,619 --> 00:54:29,780
battled just about everything at this

1389
00:54:27,358 --> 00:54:33,179
point and yet they're able to

1390
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:33,900
continually produce product

1391
00:54:33,179 --> 00:54:35,578
um

1392
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:37,619
I'd love to see more research around

1393
00:54:35,579 --> 00:54:40,200
what sorts of ecosystem successional

1394
00:54:37,619 --> 00:54:42,358
ecosystems are created in soilless media

1395
00:54:40,199 --> 00:54:44,338
that's being reused over time just from

1396
00:54:42,358 --> 00:54:46,739
a sustainability perspective that would

1397
00:54:44,338 --> 00:54:48,179
be really interesting right because you

1398
00:54:46,739 --> 00:54:50,459
know I I could go down a whole

1399
00:54:48,179 --> 00:54:52,078
sustainability rabbit hole but but there

1400
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:54,179
is so much waste

1401
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:56,220
um that I would like to see that too

1402
00:54:54,179 --> 00:54:58,980
that would be really nice

1403
00:54:56,219 --> 00:55:01,019
um think about though that without the

1404
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:04,199
full spread of antagonists that when

1405
00:55:01,019 --> 00:55:06,179
something is introduced it it can just

1406
00:55:04,199 --> 00:55:09,539
get away from you so this grower you

1407
00:55:06,179 --> 00:55:11,879
said that's been reusing media

1408
00:55:09,539 --> 00:55:13,980
um that's a unicorn it would be nice if

1409
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:15,838
we could say that and I I would love I

1410
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:17,338
would love to stick my hands in that in

1411
00:55:15,838 --> 00:55:19,578
that system

1412
00:55:17,338 --> 00:55:23,699
um but it's unusual for that to happen

1413
00:55:19,579 --> 00:55:24,300
and it just takes one introduction

1414
00:55:23,699 --> 00:55:27,838
um

1415
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:30,240
one introduction of a pathogen that

1416
00:55:27,838 --> 00:55:32,699
um that really kind of can set can set

1417
00:55:30,239 --> 00:55:33,959
things off in the wrong direction but if

1418
00:55:32,699 --> 00:55:35,639
they're good Growers and if they're

1419
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:37,679
careful about what comes in if they're

1420
00:55:35,639 --> 00:55:39,420
planting from seed and

1421
00:55:37,679 --> 00:55:41,338
um usually when we're moving soil borne

1422
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:44,400
pathogens we're moving them in soil

1423
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:46,318
again soil soil is mixed so you know if

1424
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:48,240
you get cuttings from someone else or

1425
00:55:46,318 --> 00:55:50,818
anything like that sure that's where

1426
00:55:48,239 --> 00:55:52,979
you're kind of re introducing versus

1427
00:55:50,818 --> 00:55:55,259
um I know grow like vegetable Growers

1428
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:57,358
who only bring seed in because they have

1429
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:58,859
less chance of some of those that are

1430
00:55:57,358 --> 00:56:00,358
Seaborn pathogens that's a whole nother

1431
00:55:58,858 --> 00:56:01,920
that's a whole nother podcast episode

1432
00:56:00,358 --> 00:56:04,380
but

1433
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:06,599
um but yeah it's really about

1434
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:08,099
introductions in the end if you don't

1435
00:56:06,599 --> 00:56:09,900
introduce it it's not there you can't

1436
00:56:08,099 --> 00:56:11,420
have disease if you don't introduce the

1437
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:14,280
pathogen

1438
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:15,539
totally that makes total sense and you

1439
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:16,980
know one of my best friends is an

1440
00:56:15,539 --> 00:56:18,719
entomologist who I've had on the podcast

1441
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:19,980
and I understand from a pathology

1442
00:56:18,719 --> 00:56:22,439
perspective from an entomology

1443
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:24,059
perspective like

1444
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:25,019
you want to keep things as clean as

1445
00:56:24,059 --> 00:56:27,599
possible

1446
00:56:25,019 --> 00:56:28,980
um that's just to avoid any issues in

1447
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:30,960
the in the very beginning and so this

1448
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:34,740
this idea of reusing media creates a lot

1449
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:36,720
of a lot of a lot of risk yeah and I

1450
00:56:34,739 --> 00:56:39,419
think that's something people do need to

1451
00:56:36,719 --> 00:56:41,699
be aware of I plan outside because I'm a

1452
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:44,880
I'm actually a I'm really an avid grower

1453
00:56:41,699 --> 00:56:47,039
for outdoor outdoor production but again

1454
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:48,720
that's a whole I'm sure you'll get that

1455
00:56:47,039 --> 00:56:52,558
has its other challenges from the

1456
00:56:48,719 --> 00:56:54,500
growing perspective yeah but yeah we're

1457
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:56,760
not without we're not without challenges

1458
00:56:54,500 --> 00:57:00,420
especially when you invite a pathologist

1459
00:56:56,760 --> 00:57:02,099
to talk about it right yeah well just in

1460
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:03,119
the interest of time because I know

1461
00:57:02,099 --> 00:57:04,440
we've been chatting for a while here

1462
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:05,579
there's so much more I want to ask you

1463
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:07,559
but

1464
00:57:05,579 --> 00:57:09,300
um originally I'd reached out because of

1465
00:57:07,559 --> 00:57:11,300
some of the research you had you had

1466
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:13,920
contributed to

1467
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:17,519
out of Kentucky University of Kentucky

1468
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:21,119
there and can you talk about

1469
00:57:17,519 --> 00:57:22,440
a little bit about the the silica paper

1470
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:25,318
I knew you were going to ask me about

1471
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:26,579
the Silicon paper so yeah if we could

1472
00:57:25,318 --> 00:57:27,599
start with that one and then I want to

1473
00:57:26,579 --> 00:57:30,000
touch a little bit on the other

1474
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:31,318
fungicide one that you did too just you

1475
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,119
know even if we just spent a couple

1476
00:57:31,318 --> 00:57:36,000
minutes on it that would be great okay

1477
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:37,200
all right so we uh we did a test where

1478
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:40,679
we used

1479
00:57:37,199 --> 00:57:43,558
um where we applied silicon to

1480
00:57:40,679 --> 00:57:45,539
um soilless media in the greenhouse this

1481
00:57:43,559 --> 00:57:48,420
is my green house with all of the

1482
00:57:45,539 --> 00:57:51,480
powdery mildew that I cannot get rid of

1483
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:53,639
um and that was a goal of venomycy

1484
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:56,039
spodacious I think was the was the

1485
00:57:53,639 --> 00:57:58,858
powdery mildew and

1486
00:57:56,039 --> 00:58:02,279
um we use three different rates of

1487
00:57:58,858 --> 00:58:04,739
um of um silicon

1488
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:08,339
I'm trying to think right offhand like

1489
00:58:04,739 --> 00:58:10,379
250 550 and 800 pounds per acre the

1490
00:58:08,338 --> 00:58:13,858
equivalent so we did the math and so we

1491
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:16,858
did all of this in in replicated trials

1492
00:58:13,858 --> 00:58:19,139
and then we had two different cultivars

1493
00:58:16,858 --> 00:58:20,639
um one was highly susceptible to powdery

1494
00:58:19,139 --> 00:58:23,519
mildew and what was moderately

1495
00:58:20,639 --> 00:58:27,779
susceptible to powdery mildew and um

1496
00:58:23,519 --> 00:58:30,119
basically we so we started our plugs in

1497
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:32,760
uh um in these media and then we

1498
00:58:30,119 --> 00:58:35,099
transplanted into larger containers also

1499
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:38,460
so we started really we set our clock

1500
00:58:35,099 --> 00:58:39,900
when we actually transplanted into

1501
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:43,019
I think it was the equivalent of three

1502
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:45,720
gallon pots if I remember right and

1503
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:48,119
um we we grew those plants for six weeks

1504
00:58:45,719 --> 00:58:51,239
and we looked at we rated the amount of

1505
00:58:48,119 --> 00:58:52,798
powdery mildew on those plants

1506
00:58:51,239 --> 00:58:54,659
um and

1507
00:58:52,798 --> 00:58:59,519
this was by the way this was last night

1508
00:58:54,659 --> 00:59:01,500
uh well last night sorry I um and so

1509
00:58:59,519 --> 00:59:04,679
um essentially that

1510
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:05,838
um 600 kilograms per hectare which comes

1511
00:59:04,679 --> 00:59:09,058
out to

1512
00:59:05,838 --> 00:59:11,099
535 pounds per acre

1513
00:59:09,059 --> 00:59:14,339
um calculation

1514
00:59:11,099 --> 00:59:18,480
um that is what that really managed

1515
00:59:14,338 --> 00:59:21,119
powdery mildew to at really low levels

1516
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:23,760
for an entire six weeks

1517
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:25,019
so we were talking about uh what are

1518
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:28,380
what our

1519
00:59:25,019 --> 00:59:31,798
um Arsenal is there's a lot of work that

1520
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:33,838
needs to be done with silicon in um in

1521
00:59:31,798 --> 00:59:35,639
cannabis all together it is an

1522
00:59:33,838 --> 00:59:37,798
accumulator by the way that's a whole

1523
00:59:35,639 --> 00:59:40,980
nother part of that paper and we

1524
00:59:37,798 --> 00:59:42,358
confirmed that it was an accumulator

1525
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:47,338
but

1526
00:59:42,358 --> 00:59:49,380
um we were looking at 80 to 80 reduction

1527
00:59:47,338 --> 00:59:51,719
in the amount of powdery mildew compared

1528
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:54,358
to the non-treated control

1529
00:59:51,719 --> 00:59:56,279
it was fascinating that's that's

1530
00:59:54,358 --> 00:59:58,440
incredible and while last night is a

1531
00:59:56,280 --> 01:00:00,298
very affordable option a couple things I

1532
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:01,920
think of um so when last night calcium

1533
01:00:00,298 --> 01:00:05,099
silicate

1534
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:07,380
um like I said very affordable uh you it

1535
01:00:05,099 --> 01:00:09,180
will raise your pH and it will add

1536
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:12,059
calcium to your soil so you'd want to

1537
01:00:09,179 --> 01:00:13,618
account for that in your fertility if

1538
01:00:12,059 --> 01:00:15,059
you were to add it like I wouldn't just

1539
01:00:13,619 --> 01:00:17,160
add it indiscriminately to get to the

1540
01:00:15,059 --> 01:00:19,440
silica levels I assume you guys looked

1541
01:00:17,159 --> 01:00:21,838
at the fertility there too we did yeah

1542
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:23,700
we did we adjusted pH so that that is

1543
01:00:21,838 --> 01:00:24,960
all in the paper

1544
01:00:23,699 --> 01:00:26,699
so

1545
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:28,318
I just wanted listeners to think about

1546
01:00:26,699 --> 01:00:29,699
that before they just go running out to

1547
01:00:28,318 --> 01:00:31,558
grab last night

1548
01:00:29,699 --> 01:00:33,118
um yeah that's right is there any is

1549
01:00:31,559 --> 01:00:37,019
there any future research around other

1550
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:39,358
types of ways of adding uh

1551
01:00:37,019 --> 01:00:41,818
silicon to soil

1552
01:00:39,358 --> 01:00:44,039
no so here in Kentucky

1553
01:00:41,818 --> 01:00:47,579
um we have sufficient amounts of silicon

1554
01:00:44,039 --> 01:00:50,818
in our soils in our natural soils

1555
01:00:47,579 --> 01:00:54,599
um so it's not something we think that

1556
01:00:50,818 --> 01:00:56,460
would be beneficial at the field level

1557
01:00:54,599 --> 01:00:59,818
um definitely at the greenhouse level in

1558
01:00:56,460 --> 01:01:03,000
soilless mix we do know from other

1559
01:00:59,818 --> 01:01:07,079
research in other systems that bipolaris

1560
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:10,219
or Casper fusarium septoria are all have

1561
01:01:07,079 --> 01:01:12,260
all been documented uh confirmed to be

1562
01:01:10,219 --> 01:01:15,598
reduced by

1563
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:19,020
silicon in soil as media

1564
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:22,260
so those are all big pathogens in in

1565
01:01:19,019 --> 01:01:24,780
help in particular and so it would be

1566
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:27,000
really great if someone would pick up

1567
01:01:24,780 --> 01:01:29,460
that torch and run with it I don't see

1568
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:31,079
that in my future I just have other

1569
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:35,099
things

1570
01:01:31,079 --> 01:01:37,140
um but but cannabis is an accumulator

1571
01:01:35,099 --> 01:01:40,318
and

1572
01:01:37,139 --> 01:01:41,400
um a lot of cannabis pathogens are known

1573
01:01:40,318 --> 01:01:44,818
to be

1574
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:47,400
um reduced by silicon

1575
01:01:44,818 --> 01:01:48,539
yeah I did a whole podcast on Silicon

1576
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:49,099
with another

1577
01:01:48,539 --> 01:01:51,599
um

1578
01:01:49,099 --> 01:01:53,640
with another University Research and it

1579
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:54,780
was it was amazing I learned so much

1580
01:01:53,639 --> 01:01:55,679
about it

1581
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:57,780
um

1582
01:01:55,679 --> 01:01:59,818
one thing I will add if people are using

1583
01:01:57,780 --> 01:02:01,500
elastinite is to make sure that it's not

1584
01:01:59,818 --> 01:02:03,259
high in heavy metals because there is a

1585
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:05,579
lot of heavy metal testing now happening

1586
01:02:03,260 --> 01:02:07,380
being that it is a mined product that's

1587
01:02:05,579 --> 01:02:10,500
another thing to account for

1588
01:02:07,380 --> 01:02:11,940
for folks but that's uh that's wonderful

1589
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:13,619
so

1590
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:17,280
I'm excited to see where that research

1591
01:02:13,619 --> 01:02:19,680
goes uh can you briefly tell me a little

1592
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:22,200
bit about your other research that you

1593
01:02:19,679 --> 01:02:25,858
did comparing uh Biologicals and

1594
01:02:22,199 --> 01:02:28,939
fungicides on hemp oh yeah

1595
01:02:25,858 --> 01:02:31,798
oh that paper in particular

1596
01:02:28,940 --> 01:02:33,960
it was we called it pre-screening so

1597
01:02:31,798 --> 01:02:37,980
this was all done in vitro we did this

1598
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:40,980
in the lab in uh Petri dishes and we we

1599
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:45,000
did a variety of um

1600
01:02:40,980 --> 01:02:46,740
of screening methods so uh one thing we

1601
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:49,199
did is we

1602
01:02:46,739 --> 01:02:53,639
um amended media with different

1603
01:02:49,199 --> 01:02:55,500
biological fungicides we also had our

1604
01:02:53,639 --> 01:02:58,558
conventional fungicides as our controls

1605
01:02:55,500 --> 01:03:00,780
right so what was that comparison so we

1606
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:01,798
we had another

1607
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:05,160
um

1608
01:03:01,798 --> 01:03:09,780
another test so we put

1609
01:03:05,159 --> 01:03:10,920
um a strip of or stripe of

1610
01:03:09,780 --> 01:03:13,559
um

1611
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:15,720
of a fungicide a biological across the

1612
01:03:13,559 --> 01:03:19,680
center of a Petra dish and then we put

1613
01:03:15,719 --> 01:03:22,078
plugs of our pathogens on each side and

1614
01:03:19,679 --> 01:03:23,039
so that was the the

1615
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:25,980
um

1616
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:28,558
the premise there is that if some of

1617
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:31,500
these pathogens produced any kind of

1618
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:33,180
metabolite that was the antagonistic

1619
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:34,139
component

1620
01:03:33,179 --> 01:03:36,298
um

1621
01:03:34,139 --> 01:03:38,279
so there was the direct

1622
01:03:36,298 --> 01:03:40,980
um antagonism then there was some

1623
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:42,839
release of some kind of metabolite then

1624
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:46,440
our third

1625
01:03:42,838 --> 01:03:49,679
um screening method was that we

1626
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:51,659
um mixed spores with a suspension of

1627
01:03:49,679 --> 01:03:55,259
these fungicides so that might be the

1628
01:03:51,659 --> 01:03:56,940
ones that that needed time right so

1629
01:03:55,260 --> 01:03:58,200
um so we did that mix then we plated

1630
01:03:56,940 --> 01:03:59,700
those spores out and we looked at

1631
01:03:58,199 --> 01:04:02,338
germination right

1632
01:03:59,699 --> 01:04:04,139
and so one of the things that

1633
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:05,940
um we don't know about of a lot a lot of

1634
01:04:04,139 --> 01:04:08,460
our Biologicals is how long do they need

1635
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:11,400
to be on the surface to actually work

1636
01:04:08,460 --> 01:04:14,039
if you spray them at noon and you know

1637
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:16,740
it dries up and whatever's in there

1638
01:04:14,039 --> 01:04:18,779
doesn't have time to work whatever that

1639
01:04:16,739 --> 01:04:20,159
mode of action those are some things we

1640
01:04:18,780 --> 01:04:23,400
didn't know so we developed this

1641
01:04:20,159 --> 01:04:26,460
pre-screening method that we were um

1642
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:30,480
hoping to see and really

1643
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:33,720
there was a really wide range and um

1644
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:36,420
I have not just the the paper but we did

1645
01:04:33,719 --> 01:04:38,818
what we call a um a translational piece

1646
01:04:36,420 --> 01:04:40,680
where we kind of write the research up

1647
01:04:38,818 --> 01:04:43,920
for for Growers who don't want all the

1648
01:04:40,679 --> 01:04:45,659
nitty-gritty uh scientific jargon and uh

1649
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:48,240
there's a table in there that we added

1650
01:04:45,659 --> 01:04:51,058
that really just shows all of the

1651
01:04:48,239 --> 01:04:54,000
different types of of experiments like

1652
01:04:51,059 --> 01:04:56,220
how how to best screen those things

1653
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:59,099
um which products seem to have the best

1654
01:04:56,219 --> 01:05:01,919
results and so this is intended to be

1655
01:04:59,099 --> 01:05:05,220
our next our first step in what will be

1656
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:06,720
a series so our our next go-to is we're

1657
01:05:05,219 --> 01:05:08,098
going to take select products the ones

1658
01:05:06,719 --> 01:05:09,659
that did the best in some of these

1659
01:05:08,099 --> 01:05:11,099
studies and we're going into the

1660
01:05:09,659 --> 01:05:13,558
greenhouse

1661
01:05:11,099 --> 01:05:15,539
and then from there we'll take the next

1662
01:05:13,559 --> 01:05:16,680
the next group and they'll go into the

1663
01:05:15,539 --> 01:05:18,058
field

1664
01:05:16,679 --> 01:05:20,039
um because we can't afford to put

1665
01:05:18,059 --> 01:05:23,700
everything in the field

1666
01:05:20,039 --> 01:05:25,858
um there's not much hemp or we have to

1667
01:05:23,699 --> 01:05:28,078
all of our research at the university is

1668
01:05:25,858 --> 01:05:30,119
on hemp by the way so if anybody who's

1669
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:32,519
wondering why I keep saying Help

1670
01:05:30,119 --> 01:05:33,780
um we cannot work on marijuana at the

1671
01:05:32,519 --> 01:05:34,559
University

1672
01:05:33,780 --> 01:05:35,880
um

1673
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:36,540
so

1674
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:39,780
um

1675
01:05:36,539 --> 01:05:41,400
so we can't afford so the the funding is

1676
01:05:39,780 --> 01:05:43,500
just not there so we can't just bring

1677
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:44,519
all of these products into the field and

1678
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:47,400
test for all of these different

1679
01:05:44,519 --> 01:05:48,838
pathogens it's not possible so we have

1680
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:51,420
to we have to have some kind of

1681
01:05:48,838 --> 01:05:54,058
pre-screening method where do we start

1682
01:05:51,420 --> 01:05:55,920
um where where is our time that's been

1683
01:05:54,059 --> 01:05:58,019
where is our money best spent so that

1684
01:05:55,920 --> 01:06:01,260
was the premise of this pre-screening

1685
01:05:58,019 --> 01:06:03,420
method but you can look at this table

1686
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:05,520
and you'll see that

1687
01:06:03,420 --> 01:06:07,858
a lot of these products are working in a

1688
01:06:05,519 --> 01:06:10,858
Petri dish why don't they work in the

1689
01:06:07,858 --> 01:06:12,420
field that's where we know it's not the

1690
01:06:10,858 --> 01:06:14,519
product it's our use it's our

1691
01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:16,858
application method it's our time of

1692
01:06:14,519 --> 01:06:18,659
application there there are other

1693
01:06:16,858 --> 01:06:20,818
questions and when I said at the very

1694
01:06:18,659 --> 01:06:22,980
beginning of our conversation we don't

1695
01:06:20,818 --> 01:06:25,739
know how to use them

1696
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:27,719
um we really don't so we have a lot of

1697
01:06:25,739 --> 01:06:29,519
things coming up this year and next

1698
01:06:27,719 --> 01:06:32,118
where we're going to start teasing some

1699
01:06:29,519 --> 01:06:32,119
of this apart

1700
01:06:32,460 --> 01:06:37,679
so if it didn't suppress well in a petri

1701
01:06:36,059 --> 01:06:39,420
dish

1702
01:06:37,679 --> 01:06:40,980
is there ever a case where you might get

1703
01:06:39,420 --> 01:06:42,960
an infield response that would be

1704
01:06:40,980 --> 01:06:44,818
surprising or

1705
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:47,460
is that a product that we may not want

1706
01:06:44,818 --> 01:06:48,538
to necessarily use at this point in our

1707
01:06:47,460 --> 01:06:51,480
garden I know you can't make

1708
01:06:48,539 --> 01:06:54,380
recommendations necessarily but just as

1709
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:54,380
a general rule

1710
01:06:54,798 --> 01:06:59,519
if there is for example systemic

1711
01:06:57,539 --> 01:07:01,200
acquired resistance you're turning on an

1712
01:06:59,519 --> 01:07:03,000
immune system in your plant

1713
01:07:01,199 --> 01:07:05,038
that product should not work in a Petri

1714
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:07,920
dish right because it does not have a

1715
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:11,280
direct effect on the pathogen it's a

1716
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:13,079
it's a plant immune response and so we

1717
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:15,539
do have a couple of those in the study

1718
01:07:13,079 --> 01:07:16,920
and um they didn't do well of course

1719
01:07:15,539 --> 01:07:18,720
they didn't

1720
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:20,818
um we knew that and we say that very

1721
01:07:18,719 --> 01:07:23,578
clearly in our conclusion like this is

1722
01:07:20,818 --> 01:07:25,318
not so so if you are going to look at

1723
01:07:23,579 --> 01:07:26,460
this study by the way any of your

1724
01:07:25,318 --> 01:07:28,318
listeners

1725
01:07:26,460 --> 01:07:31,380
um be careful about what we're actually

1726
01:07:28,318 --> 01:07:34,920
what we're actually saying there right

1727
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:37,740
um regalia is one like regalia didn't do

1728
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:42,119
well in this study because it's not

1729
01:07:37,739 --> 01:07:43,919
meant to it has another motive of action

1730
01:07:42,119 --> 01:07:46,318
um and I've picked on regalia twice

1731
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:48,298
today and it's a fabulous product but

1732
01:07:46,318 --> 01:07:52,139
this is not what it's meant for

1733
01:07:48,298 --> 01:07:54,780
so that is and and we know we know those

1734
01:07:52,139 --> 01:07:56,699
so we have we have conversations with

1735
01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:59,039
these manufacturers they tell us what

1736
01:07:56,699 --> 01:08:00,838
we're what they expect it to do and they

1737
01:07:59,039 --> 01:08:02,700
guide us along the way too they

1738
01:08:00,838 --> 01:08:03,659
developed it they know their products

1739
01:08:02,699 --> 01:08:05,519
yeah

1740
01:08:03,659 --> 01:08:07,500
um so yeah a systemic acquired

1741
01:08:05,519 --> 01:08:09,119
resistance would be the one that we

1742
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:10,798
would not expect to do well in our

1743
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:13,640
pre-screening but we would definitely

1744
01:08:10,798 --> 01:08:13,639
bring it to the field

1745
01:08:14,219 --> 01:08:18,119
yeah I mean we haven't we didn't really

1746
01:08:16,380 --> 01:08:19,920
talk about SAR responses and how

1747
01:08:18,119 --> 01:08:21,140
products might trigger that or different

1748
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:24,239
applications

1749
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:26,279
around chitin and the chitinase pathway

1750
01:08:24,238 --> 01:08:27,718
and if those things affect microbes

1751
01:08:26,279 --> 01:08:29,100
there's so much I would love to ask you

1752
01:08:27,719 --> 01:08:31,439
but I know we've been talking for a

1753
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:33,060
while maybe we could do a follow-up when

1754
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:34,439
you have some more research or when you

1755
01:08:33,060 --> 01:08:36,298
have some more free time I would love

1756
01:08:34,439 --> 01:08:38,039
that

1757
01:08:36,298 --> 01:08:39,838
absolutely um

1758
01:08:38,039 --> 01:08:41,338
well well thank you so much one last

1759
01:08:39,838 --> 01:08:44,278
thing uh

1760
01:08:41,338 --> 01:08:47,219
so you work with people in Kentucky that

1761
01:08:44,279 --> 01:08:49,020
are growing hemp you're not available to

1762
01:08:47,219 --> 01:08:52,679
work with just any old person who just

1763
01:08:49,020 --> 01:08:54,540
has a plant disease what resources does

1764
01:08:52,679 --> 01:08:56,039
someone like myself in Washington have

1765
01:08:54,539 --> 01:08:58,140
where should I begin to search from a

1766
01:08:56,039 --> 01:09:01,380
pathology perspective to get assistance

1767
01:08:58,140 --> 01:09:03,420
with with my plans

1768
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:06,600
you need to know where your local plant

1769
01:09:03,420 --> 01:09:10,219
disease Diagnostic lab is and in some

1770
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:13,798
states you can your University

1771
01:09:10,219 --> 01:09:16,380
Diagnostic lab will take not just hemp

1772
01:09:13,798 --> 01:09:18,119
but cannabis as well some State Labs and

1773
01:09:16,380 --> 01:09:21,420
on the west coast there are State Labs

1774
01:09:18,119 --> 01:09:23,099
they may or may not also take those

1775
01:09:21,420 --> 01:09:25,739
um there are some private Labs out there

1776
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:27,779
we're seeing a little bit more of those

1777
01:09:25,738 --> 01:09:30,119
um get to know people though

1778
01:09:27,779 --> 01:09:32,279
um really

1779
01:09:30,119 --> 01:09:34,318
um be careful where you go make sure you

1780
01:09:32,279 --> 01:09:38,040
have an actual pathologist and not just

1781
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:41,880
someone who's been uh who's been reading

1782
01:09:38,039 --> 01:09:44,399
a lot of online articles and um really

1783
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:46,500
get a diagnosis and that that gets you

1784
01:09:44,399 --> 01:09:49,439
started and even if there's not a

1785
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:51,359
reference on that pathogen in cannabis

1786
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:53,818
you can at least learn that life cycle

1787
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:55,560
and we talked about some examples today

1788
01:09:53,819 --> 01:09:58,260
but knowing those life cycles and

1789
01:09:55,560 --> 01:10:00,600
knowing overwintering and survival of a

1790
01:09:58,260 --> 01:10:02,400
pathogen will take you so far I can't

1791
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:03,120
say that enough

1792
01:10:02,399 --> 01:10:04,259
um

1793
01:10:03,119 --> 01:10:06,800
we didn't get to talk about

1794
01:10:04,260 --> 01:10:09,179
environmental conditions or humidity or

1795
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:11,520
and so we'll definitely have to do that

1796
01:10:09,179 --> 01:10:15,539
again but I would love to have you back

1797
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:18,420
on hand yeah no I think I think uh plant

1798
01:10:15,539 --> 01:10:19,439
diseases is like in in this sort of

1799
01:10:18,420 --> 01:10:21,239
thing is one of the biggest challenges

1800
01:10:19,439 --> 01:10:22,439
for Growers and there's so much that we

1801
01:10:21,238 --> 01:10:24,178
don't understand and there's so much

1802
01:10:22,439 --> 01:10:26,579
misinformation so I really appreciate

1803
01:10:24,179 --> 01:10:28,020
your time today and you sharing all this

1804
01:10:26,579 --> 01:10:31,800
with us so

1805
01:10:28,020 --> 01:10:33,600
okay well thanks a lot and um

1806
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:35,779
if you have any questions just reach out

1807
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:42,500
to him

1808

[Music]

1809
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:46,800
that was Dr Nicole gotchae with the

1810
01:10:45,238 --> 01:10:48,178
University of Kentucky and you are

1811
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:50,279
