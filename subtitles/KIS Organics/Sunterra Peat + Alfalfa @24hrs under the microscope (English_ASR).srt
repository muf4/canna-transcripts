1
00:00:02,279 --> 00:00:06,039
okay here's the Pete Moss with

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:15,160
Alfalfa I wasn't able to find any fungal

3
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:17,759
growth on this slide but you can see

4
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:20,118
quite a bit of bacteria cruising

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,080
around it's a great shot of a Pete Leaf

6
00:00:20,118 --> 00:00:24,879
if you ever wonder what they looked like

7
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:24,879
and if we zoom

8
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,200
in

9
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:34,199
to 400 times

10
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:39,599
magnification can really see that

11
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:39,599
bacteria cruising around

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:50,239
nicely again this is nothing but Pete

13
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:53,120
Moss the cete actually in this case with

14
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:56,479
uh a little bit of aalam in distilled

15
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:58,718
water so that's their only food source

16
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:00,878
and you can see even though the Pete was

17
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,320
pretty dehydrated

18
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:05,399
pretty good bacterial growth and

19
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:08,400
activity looks

20
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,400
great
