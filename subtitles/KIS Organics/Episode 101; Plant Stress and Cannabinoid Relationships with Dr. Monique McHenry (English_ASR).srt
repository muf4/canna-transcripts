5
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,599
where we discuss the cutting edge of

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,359
growing from a science-based perspective

7
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,800
and drawn top experts from around the

8
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,840
industry to share their wisdom and

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,799
knowledge

10
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:36,558

pharmaceutical research enterprise

23
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,879
dr mchenry completed her bachelor's and

25
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:09,039
colorado and her phd at the university

26
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,560
of vermont now on to the show

27
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,118
hi monique thanks for coming on the show

28
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,359
today

29
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:17,599
hi ted thank you so much for having me

30
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:19,040
yeah i'm excited to talk to you today

31
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:20,239
can we start off with a little bit of

32
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,479
your background you tell me a little

33
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:23,280
about yourself

34
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:26,640
sure

35
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:29,759
so my background in plant biology um

36
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,000
currently i am a professor in the

37
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,159
pharmacology department at the lawn

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,200
record of medicine at the university of

39
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,118
vermont

40
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,200
and i was one of those interdisciplinary

41
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:41,680
hires so i could teach about the

42
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,560
different chemicals found in plants and

43
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,479
how they affect the human body

44
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,079
and i am the director of the medical

45
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:50,640
cannabis center for research and

46
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:52,478
education at uvm and i run

47
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,000
a bunch of our

48
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:57,840
educational programs in cannabis

49
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,840
that's great i definitely want to talk

50
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,000
some more about the what you have going

51
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,960
on at uvm um but can we start off with

52
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,399
just a real uh basic foundation here in

53
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:09,399
terms of the different classes of

54
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,399
cannabinoids

55
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:11,598
sure

56
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,519
you know

57
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:15,598
basically there's there's three classes

58
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,560
of cannabinoids and

59
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:20,399
sometimes people misspeak about them and

60
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,000
you know even the top level scientists

61
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,719
can interchangeably use the word

62
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,239
cannabinoids which can really mean all

63
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:28,080
three

64
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,159
but specifically there's the

65
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,239
endocannabinoids that are produced and

66
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:34,000
found in the human body there's the

67
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,400
phytocannabinoids that are produced by

68
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,318
the plant hence the phyto in front of

69
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,840
them and then they're synthetic

70
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:41,598
cannabinoids and those are produced in

71
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,920
the laboratory

72
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:46,318
and sometimes used for therapeutic

73
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:49,039
treatment

74
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:52,799
so as a as a cultivator we're obviously

75
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:55,359
most interested in uh phytocannabinoids

76
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:59,439
um what are the different types of of

77
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:02,080
cannabinoids and how might we um

78
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:05,439
cultivate uh from you know for best

79
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,200
practice in terms of selecting for uh

80
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:09,199
not just better yields but also

81
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:11,759
consistency and i know that's a big

82
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:13,919
question so

83
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:15,598
right yeah i mean if you take a step

84
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:18,158
back and we think about what

85
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:20,399
phytocannabinoids are

86
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:22,399
you know they're a secondary metabolite

87
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,360
that the plant produces

88
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,760
and the plants produce tons of secondary

89
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,920
metabolites and secondary metabolites

90
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:31,679
are usually synthesized for specific

91
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:34,399
functions where your primary metabolites

92
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:37,200
are synthesized for essential functions

93
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:40,400
so these secondary metabolites can often

94
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:43,759
be produced very inconsistently between

95
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,920
plants that have genetic um

96
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:47,518
are genetically identical and it's

97
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:49,280
sometimes due to the environment

98
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,039
sometimes we don't know why the plants

99
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,400
produce you know different chemicals at

100
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:54,560
different times

101
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,640
and so with phytocannabinoids the

102
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,080
research has been going on for a long

103
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:59,598
time

104
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,480
you know there's there's papers back

105
00:03:59,598 --> 00:04:05,280
into the 70s as to why different

106
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:07,280
climates have plants that are producing

107
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:11,438
different amounts of

108
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:13,598
thc delta 9 thc for example

109
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:16,159
and it seems to be that different

110
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:17,680
stressors sometimes cause the plant to

111
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,959
produce

112
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,199
more

113
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,399
phytocannabinoid especially delta nine

114
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,439
thc

115
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:25,279
and

116
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:28,160
uh other environments

117
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:30,000
can seem to make more yield so the plant

118
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,759
actually produces more in this cat in

119
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,918
this case you know biomass being flower

120
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,479
of the plant but the chemicals might be

121
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:40,959
might be at lower levels so the

122
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:43,360
percentage of

123
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:46,879
phc per gram might be lower in those

124
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:49,520
plants in different growing environments

125
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:51,600
i want to touch on that with you so

126
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:53,039
is there a sort of a

127
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,600
genetic

128
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,400
maximum in terms of the amount of thc a

129
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,360
plant

130
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:00,560
can produce and therefore the variance

131
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,720
in

132
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,918
vegetative biomass would determine the

133
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:08,400
concentration of thc in the

134
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:10,478
in the flower

135
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:12,239
well ted i mean i think that's that's

136
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:14,719
probably a million dollar question

137
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,600
excuse the you know cliche there but

138
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:20,240
okay there has been some some hypotheses

139
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:23,280
in the literature that there is this

140
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,038
dilution effect where yeah there is a

141
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:26,638
maximum and whether it's a genetic

142
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:28,800
component or something else in the

143
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,199
biosynthetic pathway we don't know but

144
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,199
there's a maximum of what the

145
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,919
plant can produce in terms of you know

146
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:38,400
particular phytocannabinoids

147
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:41,439
but we just it doesn't seem like anybody

148
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:43,918
has really had solid evidence to say yes

149
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:46,639
to that or no to that

150
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:47,599
okay so it's a possibility but we we

151
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,639
don't know

152
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,639
um

153
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,240
you know a big buzzword

154
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,120
lately in the last year or two has been

155
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,960
crop steering this idea of sort of

156
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,840
targeted plant stress

157
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:00,638
for

158
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:00,638
you know selecting

159
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:05,199
is a way of increasing i guess

160
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,840
cannabinoid production and thc

161
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,520
specifically um

162
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:11,279
you know i've been of the impression

163
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:13,599
that every

164
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:14,799
real life facility has plant stress and

165
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,000
we don't

166
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,520
i'm still at the point where we want to

167
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,120
reduce it but

168
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:21,120
do we know enough from a research

169
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,360
perspective to really figure out like

170
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,600
what triggers really work

171
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:29,680
across the wide range of genetics that

172
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,680
we see in cannabis production right now

173
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,959
possibly you know i can i can give you

174
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:37,198
some literature out you know that's out

175
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:40,399
there so back in the 70s actually

176
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,680
specifically 1975 kaufman and gentner

177
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:44,560
these

178
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,240
two authors published a report and they

179
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,038
found that

180
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,918
low magnesium increases the amount of

181
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:53,439
thc and cbd content and so i think you

182
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:55,599
know a lot of

183
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:58,800
cultivators out there right now play

184
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:00,240
with their calcium and magnesium ratios

185
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,759
so there is published literature out

186
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,478
there that suggests

187
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:07,520
you lower the magnesium you increase the

188
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:09,598
thc and cbb

189
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:11,279
other stressors

190
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:13,439
that have been

191
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:17,119
shown to

192
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:21,279
i guess increase the amount of phc is

193
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:23,360
uvb radiation so in the 80s a paper by

194
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:26,799
linden and colleagues

195
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:29,038
said that plants with higher levels of

196
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:32,720
uvb radiation

197
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:36,079
had higher amounts of thc

198
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:38,400
and then we can go to recent papers like

199
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:39,439
i think i've actually had a podcast with

200
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:41,519
um

201
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:44,000
with with kaplan he was a graduate

202
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:45,359
student up in canada and he has a lot of

203
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,759
work published

204
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,080
and so his stuff from 2018 where he

205
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:54,160
intentionally you know applied drought

206
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:54,159
stress and he found that

207
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:58,719
that if you increase

208
00:07:56,478 --> 00:08:00,240
intentional drought seven weeks into

209
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,319
reproductive stage

210
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:06,560
um you have these major

211
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:08,400
phytocannabinoids so thc again increase

212
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,800
yes i did have uh

213
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:12,719
i had darren kaplan on the show a while

214
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,319
back yeah that's right that's right

215
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,479
um it's wonderful to see the new

216
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,439
research that's that's coming out

217
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:18,639
um

218
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:22,319
you know some of the more common

219
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:24,720
practices that i've seen are uh

220
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:27,598
you know more more extreme pruning

221
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,960
removing all of the the fan leaves and

222
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:30,399
also

223
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:32,639
targeted

224
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:34,559
drought or nutrient stress

225
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:37,759
you know some sort of osmotic shock

226
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:39,838
towards the very end near

227
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:42,799
closer to a harvest date you know maybe

228
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,720
anywhere from a week out from harvest

229
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:47,519
have you seen any research on on either

230
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,519
of those topics

231
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:52,240
yes so the the intentional drought was

232
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,680
the cat with um

233
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:58,720
that's kaplan he he did that and i

234
00:08:55,679 --> 00:09:01,120
haven't seen any published literature on

235
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,600
selective pruning yet

236
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,360
um but i don't want to doubt that it's

237
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,440
that it's out there we haven't done

238
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,360
anything like that at uvm we've

239
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,720
definitely done uh

240
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,240
you know played with

241
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:16,720
amount of nitrogen and found just um

242
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,560
kaplan again during his phd

243
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,959
did another study on

244
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:22,958
changing the amount of

245
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:25,359
nitrogen and there is a sweet spot where

246
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:29,919
you get you know a maximum

247
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:32,480
biomass yield and highest percentage of

248
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:35,199
of thc and he published that work and

249
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,399
uvm has put out reports on it too

250
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,120
so

251
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:41,600
nutrients are key absolutely

252
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,879
some of the work we did at uvm

253
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,800
showed that you know if you if you add

254
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:48,320
too much of

255
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:50,879
you know kind of pre-mixed bottle made

256
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,800
nutrients sometimes it's just

257
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:55,679
leaching right off we checked our runoff

258
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:57,919
and we found well that was pointless and

259
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:59,599
you do increase the biomass of the plant

260
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:00,719
but you see that dilution effect with

261
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,200
thc

262
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:06,720
where you don't have the same percentage

263
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,240
of thc per gram that you would have

264
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,639
in plants that are actually producing

265
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,399
less biomass

266
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:14,559
oh that's really interesting

267
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,000
so you had two genetically identical

268
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:18,879
plants and

269
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,799
one produced significantly more biomass

270
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:24,720
than the other under you know slightly

271
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:28,000
different nutrient conditions is that

272
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:30,720
absolutely yep yep so we saw that with

273
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,278
thc with cbd it was a little bit more

274
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,720
consistent and it seemed like when we

275
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:36,078
you know applied

276
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,000
um

277
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:40,479
some stresses to the plant or changed

278
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,679
the nutrient regime with cbd we couldn't

279
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:46,399
see that dilution effect as much

280
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:49,278
and again genetically identical plants

281
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:53,120
they were clones of the same plant

282
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:55,120
but with thc we definitely saw that

283
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,519
you know you hit a point where you

284
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,360
seemed to kind of maximize the amount of

285
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,278
thc the plant would produce even though

286
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,839
it would produce more plant matter and

287
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:05,679
dried flowers but with cbd we didn't we

288
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,519
didn't quite see that in a couple years

289
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:10,799
of trials

290
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:14,320
that's really inner is this a published

291
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:16,639
accessible paper or is this one that um

292
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,720
has not been published yet with the seat

293
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:21,759
right so with the cbd

294
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:24,879
um that work you can find um it's dr

295
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:28,000
heather darley writes reports every year

296
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:29,278
um and she puts him up on the industrial

297
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,120
hemp

298
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:35,519
website at the uvm through uvm extension

299
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,799
program and so you can see the results

300
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,519
of you know the different nutrient

301
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:42,159
gradients as well as

302
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:44,159
everything i mentioned there for cbd for

303
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:45,838
thc that work isn't published because it

304
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:47,759
was done in conjunction with a

305
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:50,399
dispensary here it couldn't be done at

306
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:53,278
uvm because of

307
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,679
the legality issues

308
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:57,039
oh that makes sense um

309
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:59,120
well

310
00:11:57,039 --> 00:12:02,319
can you talk to me a little bit about

311
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:04,320
the uvm program and what sort of um

312
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,079
offerings you guys have as well as some

313
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,320
of the research that you're currently

314
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:08,319
doing

315
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:12,799
sure i would love to i did want to

316
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,639
mention there was one other thing

317
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:16,799
hormones did you want to get into that

318
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:19,039
um oh like we have uh

319
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:20,399
yeah absolutely so

320
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:22,958
people are also i think applying

321
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,720
jasmonic acid right and there has been a

322
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:25,679
paper recently published

323
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,040
um

324
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:28,319
by

325
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:32,078
epic

326
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:35,519
and colleagues in 2021 so just last year

327
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:39,519
and in that they show that jasmonic acid

328
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:41,039
so ja as a lot of people know it as

329
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:44,879
after two weeks

330
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:46,480
can increase the amount of thc

331
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:48,320
so that's another i think that's another

332
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,200
thing some cultivators have been doing

333
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:54,320
is using these plant morphe genes or

334
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:56,320
plant hormones applied to

335
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,760
different stages of flowering to see

336
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,480
what changes the

337
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:01,360
the amounts of phytocannabinoids there

338
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,360
but

339
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,320
sorry for that interruption i would love

340
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,800
to talk about the uvm program well let's

341
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,240
why don't we talk a little more about um

342
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:11,919
hormones while we're on the topic and

343
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,519
then because we have plenty of time

344
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:15,278
still um

345
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,959
right that's that's really i actually

346
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:19,759
just saw an interesting paper on

347
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:22,638
triacontinol from 2020

348
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:25,679
by uh i'm gonna mispronounce the name

349
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:27,120
shyastol islam i reached out to him

350
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:28,479
directly but

351
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,480
one of the challenges is since he's not

352
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,639
working in cannabis and he's in another

353
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,720
country it's sometimes hard to get those

354
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,680
folks to come on the podcast but

355
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,200
um

356
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:39,359
what what sort of research are you

357
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,440
seeing around uh plant growth hormones

358
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:45,278
or what what sort of maybe speculation

359
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:48,320
do you have of what might work well with

360
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:49,120
cannabis or hemp production

361
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,040
well

362
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,839
i mean if i think about the plant's

363
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:56,240
reaction to you know different plant

364
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,760
morphogens or wounding so like you said

365
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,120
selective pruning you know there's

366
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:02,799
usually a

367
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:04,639
spike in calcium levels um and

368
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:06,479
i would say that's almost a stress and

369
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,240
when you have a calcium spike in in

370
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,639
plants just like you can have in humans

371
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:13,278
as a stress you know i would hypothesize

372
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:15,919
that that that could increase the amount

373
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:19,519
of thc but i haven't really seen anyone

374
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:22,078
delve into that science yet but um

375
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:23,440
you know that seems to be an expectation

376
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:25,439
you know at

377
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,199
a more scientific level of what is going

378
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,279
on inside the plant

379
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:31,838
um and so you know what hormones would

380
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:32,720
would cause that reaction in the plant

381
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,560
um

382
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,959
you know

383
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:37,759
i don't know you know jasmine acid seems

384
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:40,000
to

385
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:41,919
you know oxen is another huge plant

386
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,278
hormone or morphogen some people like to

387
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:47,439
refer to it as and it's responsible for

388
00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:48,799
cool things like sunflowers turning

389
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,399
towards the light

390
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:53,198
you know it collects in the bending side

391
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,839
so

392
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:59,198
perhaps you know hormones or morphogens

393
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:01,320
like that are involved in

394
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:04,078
some of the phytocannabinoid

395
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:05,600
inconsistencies but i haven't seen much

396
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:07,519
in the literature on that so i don't

397
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,360
know what other hormones you know i

398
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,759
would suggest

399
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:14,800
besides

400
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:15,600
the ones we've already talked about

401
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:16,479
yeah

402
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,560
so

403
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,360
for folks that uh

404
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:21,039
i guess

405
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,079
as an organic

406
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:24,078
producer myself

407
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,000
it's hard to find organic sources of a

408
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,079
lot of these

409
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,720
hormones that will actually translate

410
00:15:30,078 --> 00:15:34,879
into plant available in another plant

411
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,680
like i know for a long time i just

412
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:40,078
i would apply alpha meal to myself

413
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:42,399
thinking i was getting tricontinol

414
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:44,879
but in reality from talking to a plant

415
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:48,078
hormone expert it sounds like it's

416
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:51,039
it's quite difficult to do like it um

417
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:54,879
decomposes rather rapidly unless applied

418
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:59,039
at high levels like an alfalfa mulch

419
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:59,039
how as an organic producer might we

420
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:03,758
access some of these tools or if if at

421
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:06,000
all i guess

422
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,680
be the question

423
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,039
you know chad that is a great question

424
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:10,719
and you might you might have stumped me

425
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:12,799
at that one because i was so thinking

426
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,560
about what happens in the lab

427
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:17,359
you know where we're wearing

428
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:18,319
purple gloves and you know we're using

429
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,320
special

430
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,320
hoods for special flows that we aren't

431
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,560
worrying about what the chemical would

432
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,240
do to us as humans because we're not

433
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:27,919
ingesting it

434
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,120
but you're absolutely right

435
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:31,278
if you're trying to grow something

436
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:34,399
organically you know what what would be

437
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:36,559
a good source i might have to

438
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,399
think about that and talk to some of the

439
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:41,278
people at uvm extension to see what

440
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:43,278
ideas they would have um because

441
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:44,480
i don't know because we're we're not

442
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:46,958
necessarily

443
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,320
doing that in the lab and these papers

444
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:49,919
that i'm talking about these other

445
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,320
researchers aren't necessarily doing it

446
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:54,399
in the lab

447
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,560
and so to translate that into a field

448
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:59,120
science i'd have to have to think about

449
00:16:56,559 --> 00:17:00,958
that one okay no that's that's fine i

450
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,000
could get you an answer yeah

451
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:03,679
that's

452
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,439
sometimes i don't know is the best

453
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:07,038
answer uh

454
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,199
it's because i know like for example

455
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:11,279
with jasmonic acid there's commercially

456
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:13,120
available i could go buy jazz spray for

457
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:17,119
roses today

458
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:19,119
um and go spray it on my plants but um

459
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,479
are there other potential risks

460
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:22,958
associated with it because that would be

461
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,400
an off-label use i just want to

462
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,600
i don't want

463
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,759
people listening to podcasts to

464
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:29,199
necessarily get ahead of themselves and

465
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:30,798
end up in a situation where they may be

466
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,960
doing something that could be unsafe for

467
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:35,519
consumption so

468
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:38,319
right can you touch on that a little bit

469
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:40,960
before we get too far ahead of the on to

470
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:40,960
another topic

471
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,240
absolutely right so i mean

472
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:48,880
i think that's a great emphasis point is

473
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,558
that you know people listening to

474
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,360
this podcast from agricultural

475
00:17:50,558 --> 00:17:55,038
perspective or even from a production or

476
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:56,719
a medical perspective you know some of

477
00:17:55,038 --> 00:17:57,599
the things we're talking about are done

478
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,600
in

479
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:02,719
scientific settings right it doesn't

480
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:04,798
mean they should be applied to um

481
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,759
something for human consumption right

482
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:07,519
like

483
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:09,919
yes you know there are synthetic

484
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:12,400
cannabinoids out there that people use

485
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:14,160
off-label you know approved by the fda

486
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,400
people are using off-label but i

487
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,720
definitely don't encourage people to do

488
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:21,440
that and same with

489
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,160
pesticide applications

490
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,200
is

491
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,240
you know there's not that many

492
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,840
pesticides with cannabis on their label

493
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,000
so i don't want to encourage anyone to

494
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:31,199
use things off label

495
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,440
um

496
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,440
what harm could it do you know we don't

497
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,840
know because there haven't been those

498
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:40,160
same kind of studies or if they are

499
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:41,599
they're in their infancy um you know a

500
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,558
couple years in

501
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:44,798
of

502
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:47,038
you know at what point

503
00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:48,960
um is it safe to apply certain

504
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:50,558
pesticides to cannabis

505
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,160
because you know

506
00:18:50,558 --> 00:18:53,759
it will be inhaled and a lot of people

507
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,400
say well why can't you just compare it

508
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:58,240
to the tobacco industry and i mean

509
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,320
that's a whole can of worms do we really

510
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,919
want to compare it to the tobacco

511
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:03,599
industry

512
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:06,000
you know i don't know i don't know if

513
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:08,240
it's safe to answer that question but

514
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,839
um it's hard because you can't really

515
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:13,919
compare cannabis to lettuce you know

516
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:16,240
probably 10 years ago we were writing

517
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:18,320
white papers to try to help

518
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,359
legislatures determine

519
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:21,759
you know

520
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:23,439
what levels of pesticides are safe and

521
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:25,759
you know when can they be applied you

522
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,840
know what levels of residues and the

523
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:29,919
truth is you can suggest what is known

524
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:31,199
about other crops but with cannabis

525
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,440
there's not

526
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:37,440
enough quite known yet

527
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:39,279
so as you all know especially

528
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,960
people in different states every state

529
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:44,960
has its own list of allowable

530
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,640
levels and

531
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,200
sometimes it's not based on science

532
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,799
unfortunately

533
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:54,480
yeah that brings up another question for

534
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:57,038
me uh you know you've listed some great

535
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,960
research to support some of these ideas

536
00:19:57,038 --> 00:20:01,440
um

537
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,519
and concepts and as a

538
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,558
as a curious

539
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:07,279
grower

540
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:09,440
i'm always looking for more information

541
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:12,160
trying to learn more

542
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,519
where what resources does the average

543
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,919
layman have

544
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:18,639
for you know finding information like

545
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:20,080
some of the ones you listed

546
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,759
how do we go searching for that because

547
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:23,279
you know if i go to google scholar i can

548
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:25,359
type in

549
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:26,558
you know magnesium for example and thc

550
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:30,240
and get

551
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:32,079
probably like a ton of different hits um

552
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,120
what what do you recommend are there any

553
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:35,439
like

554
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:36,959
publications to follow or anything that

555
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,279
you that you really like to use for that

556
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,079
sort of thing

557
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:41,359
well

558
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:42,798
ted i think you

559
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:44,959
you kind of hit the

560
00:20:42,798 --> 00:20:46,400
you know snail on its head there you you

561
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,919
had a great suggestion i mean that is

562
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,919
the most uh

563
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:54,000
you know path of least resistance is to

564
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:57,279
look in google scholar

565
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,960
um and then you know a trick there is to

566
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:01,200
once you find a publication that's

567
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:04,000
interesting if it's older look at the

568
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:07,120
papers that are citing it

569
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,558
and a lot of our public libraries or you

570
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:12,079
know if you're connected at all to any

571
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:14,480
kind of research institute or

572
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:16,480
or university then

573
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,720
you have the availability to do what's

574
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,798
called cross library loans so even if

575
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,038
your public library doesn't have that

576
00:21:20,798 --> 00:21:23,918
resource electronically you could ask

577
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:25,599
the

578
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:28,080
librarian the reference librarian

579
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:29,759
usually to help you know ask for that

580
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:30,399
from a library that does

581
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:32,079
so

582
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,400
you know it is a little more challenging

583
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:36,879
to get access to some of these articles

584
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,880
and fortunately a lot of things are um

585
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,480
open source now so they're still

586
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,360
peer-reviewed so they still go through

587
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:46,079
that scientific rigor you know

588
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:48,639
to get up to publication status

589
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:50,480
but they don't cost money

590
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,840
because unfortunately the ones that

591
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,880
aren't you know it's quite expensive

592
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:56,720
it's like 35 to download a pdf of an

593
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,520
article that i'm referencing

594
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,480
um

595
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:02,079
but yeah for the for the lay person i

596
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,960
think google scholar is a great start

597
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:07,519
and then they're looking at um the

598
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,679
sources that cite it review articles are

599
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:11,599
a treasure right so if you have a

600
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,798
scientist that basically compiles the

601
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:13,678
literature

602
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:18,158
and

603
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:19,600
finds um you know everything they can

604
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:22,000
publishes it

605
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:23,119
as a review

606
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,558
you know

607
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:26,479
a little slice

608
00:22:24,558 --> 00:22:28,158
for that particular time

609
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,400
of all the past

610
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,640
research done those are those are huge

611
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:35,038
fines you know as well as textbooks too

612
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:37,440
um especially textbooks that are going

613
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:39,759
to have a reference list so that you

614
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,240
know somebody took the time to actually

615
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:43,440
find if this information was scientific

616
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,519
or not

617
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,600
and i think there are some some up and

618
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:49,279
coming you know cultivation books out

619
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:51,119
there

620
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:54,079
that are helping

621
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:56,558
the old kind of bibles that people have

622
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:58,319
used in the past

623
00:22:56,558 --> 00:23:00,319
oh that's wonderful i wasn't aware of

624
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:02,798
any upcoming books that's

625
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:05,279
that's great

626
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:07,279
one question i thought about as i was

627
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:08,798
listening to you talk about

628
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:10,480
research is

629
00:23:08,798 --> 00:23:12,960
how does one

630
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:15,599
extrapolate research

631
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,880
effectively because i realize

632
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:19,678
what happens in the lab doesn't

633
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:22,720
necessarily translate to

634
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:24,640
commercial production or

635
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,798
you know real life

636
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,960
real life production um

637
00:23:26,798 --> 00:23:30,240
how how do we take

638
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,079
you know say

639
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,159
some of these ideas

640
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:36,480
um and translate them into actual

641
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:38,240
production in a way that makes sense

642
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,599
without drawing too many conclusions

643
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,440
like for example like i did with the

644
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:42,719
alfalfa and tricontinol would be a great

645
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,798
example like

646
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,440
i see that triangle has these benefits

647
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:49,839
so i make this assumption um

648
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,880
the work wasn't done on cannabis like

649
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:53,359
you know what

650
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:56,400
what can we really do there as from a

651
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:58,479
from a cultivation perspective

652
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:01,440
right so i mean i think there's there's

653
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:03,038
one way for for the brave people is in

654
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,360
any article you're going to see a

655
00:24:03,038 --> 00:24:07,200
corresponding author and it will have

656
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:08,158
their contact information using an email

657
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,080
address

658
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,320
and just you know ask the author first

659
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:14,158
if they know a different

660
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:16,720
a different way or how to translate what

661
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:18,640
they did in the lab to the field

662
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,798
if not uh

663
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,720
you know you can you can ask the you

664
00:24:20,798 --> 00:24:24,158
know knowledgeable people at

665
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:27,519
at your local

666
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:30,640
uh hydroponic or garden store right if

667
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:33,599
they know uh a particular

668
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:36,640
methodology to

669
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:38,319
utilize you know jasmonic acids but i

670
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,000
like like we talked about with cannabis

671
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:42,319
it is harder because again you'll

672
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,880
probably be using things off label

673
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:47,278
and perhaps like you were saying um

674
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:49,360
incorrectly so

675
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:51,200
i mean really the best answer is for

676
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:54,479
people like you to have these awesome

677
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:56,720
podcasts where uh you have researchers

678
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,319
who say oh yeah this is exactly how you

679
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,480
should do it but

680
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:03,200
um or you

681
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,960
you you take a class you know there are

682
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,200
a lot of uh

683
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,600
cannabis classes out there where

684
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:13,440
uh like ours we bring in subject matter

685
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:14,639
experts who go into detail um and you

686
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,798
know you have question and answer

687
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:19,120
sessions but yeah it's basically getting

688
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:21,440
the scientists behind a microphone so

689
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:23,278
they can help answer

690
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,120
yeah and i i do want to caution people

691
00:25:23,278 --> 00:25:27,119
from drawing too many inferences for my

692
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:29,439
paper like

693
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:31,278
even just for example the the kaplan

694
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,919
paper on on drought stress would be an

695
00:25:31,278 --> 00:25:34,960
example of this like um you know he got

696
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,720
a very

697
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:40,159
you know statistically significant

698
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:42,640
response with a very particular cultivar

699
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:45,200
under you know very specific conditions

700
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,640
that may lead us to believe there's a

701
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,278
trend there

702
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,799
but there's absolutely room for

703
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:53,119
replication

704
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:55,038
over time with various cultivars under

705
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:56,399
various conditions to see if this is

706
00:25:55,038 --> 00:25:58,400
actually

707
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,320
the case um i think we're still in our

708
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:03,278
infancy in cannabis

709
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:05,119
in that regard and

710
00:26:03,278 --> 00:26:07,119
you know i just hear a lot of people

711
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:08,639
confidently saying things in the

712
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:12,399
cultivation space

713
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,440
based off of one paper or one idea that

714
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,919
um

715
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:18,080
maybe we need to just take a step back

716
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:19,278
and

717
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:21,199
you know take a little more of a wait

718
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:22,558
and see process as we do more research i

719
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,960
guess i just want to throw that out

720
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:26,480
there for folks

721
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,319
well that's a good idea and you know

722
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,679
chad i would i would really encourage

723
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:32,158
anyone working for

724
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:34,880
you know a larger cannabis company to

725
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:36,799
encourage the company to have a small

726
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,120
side r d

727
00:26:36,798 --> 00:26:40,879
room right so that you can explore this

728
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:43,839
obviously if you had a huge cultivation

729
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,880
facility um or field you're not going to

730
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:46,959
want to

731
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:50,240
um blindly apply

732
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:52,720
a stressor to it and uh because it will

733
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,000
affect your yield right i mean it's what

734
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,079
what i was saying and what we were

735
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,240
seeing is your yield does go down even

736
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:59,839
though your percent of thc goes up in

737
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,720
lots of cases

738
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:02,558
um

739
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:05,919
and you know it would be great if

740
00:27:02,558 --> 00:27:07,440
everyone had an ability to do a trial

741
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:08,799
run before they

742
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,320
you know applied some of this on their

743
00:27:08,798 --> 00:27:12,879
whole crop but

744
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:14,960
yes you're right we are in our infancy

745
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,240
and and people shouldn't get carried

746
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,000
away

747
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,880
well the biggest challenge i see with

748
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,480
facilities is one they're just swamped

749
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,880
with the day-to-day and two they don't

750
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:27,120
always have the tools to

751
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:29,120
apply you know proper scientific

752
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:30,798
methodology and rigor and then

753
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:32,239
understand how to collect that data in a

754
00:27:30,798 --> 00:27:33,759
way that they can get

755
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,798
um you know

756
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:37,839
accurate statistically significant

757
00:27:36,798 --> 00:27:41,119
um

758
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:43,519
you know results and so uh that's that's

759
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:45,918
been a challenge but there are so there

760
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:47,359
are some in-house researchers in some of

761
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,640
these facilities doing amazing work that

762
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:51,038
i've gotten to talk to over the years

763
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,320
and so hopefully

764
00:27:51,038 --> 00:27:55,759
more and more of that information will

765
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:55,759
become available over time but

766
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:58,720
yeah i agree i think every facility

767
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:01,759
should have

768
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:03,360
should have a little r d space because

769
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:05,200
we have to continually keep improving

770
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:06,798
and and uh i think that's a great

771
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,200
suggestion

772
00:28:06,798 --> 00:28:12,480
but let's uh let's switch direction here

773
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:14,000
and talk a little bit about uvm and uh

774
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,200
your programs can you tell me a little

775
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,599
bit about what you guys have going on

776
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:20,960
there

777
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:24,240
sure so um

778
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,360
we you know it's been going on for about

779
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,880
let's see

780
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:30,959
2022 so at least since 2015

781
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:33,200
we've been doing educational programs

782
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:35,600
and before that there was hemp research

783
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,440
going on and dr darby out of the uvm

784
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:39,918
extension was leading

785
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:42,399
research mostly in

786
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:44,799
fiber and feed crops

787
00:28:42,398 --> 00:28:49,038
for hemp um

788
00:28:44,798 --> 00:28:51,200
but then in 2015 we started um

789
00:28:49,038 --> 00:28:52,879
we developed a program and the first

790
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,919
program we did was an undergraduate

791
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,320
program

792
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:58,799
uh we actually had a lot a lot more

793
00:28:56,319 --> 00:29:00,720
people than undergraduates take it

794
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:01,918
it was the first

795
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,079
cannabis

796
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:05,919
educational program for cannabis course

797
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:07,278
it's called medical cannabis

798
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:10,080
and

799
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:11,200
offered by a medical school

800
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:13,759
and

801
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,919
from there we had such high interest in

802
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:18,960
that that was a you know it was back in

803
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:21,360
2016 it actually ran that january so it

804
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:24,159
was a in person you sat in a class you

805
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:26,639
weren't in front of a computer there

806
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:28,880
and we had so many people sign up that

807
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:31,120
we had to get a bigger classroom

808
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,120
and then we we kind of had to do it by

809
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:34,959
lottery because we were worried that

810
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:36,319
other people would come in and take up

811
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,640
those seats

812
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:40,240
so we had to give a code to have people

813
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:44,000
come in and we had i think five

814
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:46,319
different of our local you know media

815
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:50,000
channels there recording our first class

816
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:51,359
it was it was a scene wow but besides

817
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,839
i know right

818
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:56,158
even seth meyers mentioned it uh late

819
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:58,639
night television said something like oh

820
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:01,278
uvm is offering a canvas class and

821
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:04,720
hilariously it did start at 4 20. but it

822
00:30:01,278 --> 00:30:07,440
started at 4 25 but you know that was

823
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:09,919
that was a good joke for everyone too

824
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,360
yeah but with that interest what we saw

825
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:13,759
is a lot of professionals took it and

826
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:16,000
that's why we offered it later in the

827
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:18,558
day so that people could take it after

828
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,159
work so then we decided to develop a

829
00:30:18,558 --> 00:30:21,599
couple

830
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:23,440
programs and the first one we developed

831
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:26,158
was targeted at medical professionals it

832
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:28,798
was cannabis science and medicine and uh

833
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:32,000
it you could earn uh continuing medical

834
00:30:28,798 --> 00:30:33,839
education so cmes with it it was i think

835
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,919
you know close to eight cme that you

836
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:37,678
would earn

837
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:39,038
and you know the interest in that grew

838
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:39,840
so much that there was always a wait

839
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:41,440
list

840
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:43,278
and a lot of people were not in the

841
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,558
medical profession and a lot of people

842
00:30:43,278 --> 00:30:46,398
wanted to learn more about the plant

843
00:30:44,558 --> 00:30:48,158
biology aspect so then we developed a

844
00:30:46,398 --> 00:30:51,678
cannabis um

845
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:53,360
plant biology professional certificate

846
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:55,600
and that one's been filling especially

847
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:59,918
because in vermont they have an upscale

848
00:30:55,599 --> 00:31:02,398
program where the state helps people

849
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:05,278
gain more professional skills by paying

850
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:06,719
for a couple of their programs and that

851
00:31:05,278 --> 00:31:10,398
is one of them

852
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:13,200
and so we do offer some free webinars um

853
00:31:10,398 --> 00:31:14,959
you know not nothing as as as impressive

854
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,480
as yours chad you know where you have

855
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:20,880
people from all over the world talking

856
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:22,640
about today but uh so so sometimes and

857
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,440
then there's a community medical program

858
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,880
where

859
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,798
we have different professors come in and

860
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:29,919
talk about their research and with all

861
00:31:26,798 --> 00:31:34,639
this activity like most universities we

862
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:34,640
started a cannabis center so ours is the

863
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:40,000
is the

864
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:42,880
medical center for cannabis education

865
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,839
and research and

866
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:47,600
basically what that does is it helps

867
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:49,359
researchers

868
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:50,719
work together

869
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:52,719
because we do have a lot of cannabis

870
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,200
research going on at uvm both in the

871
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:57,600
college of medicine and in the college

872
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,319
of agricultural life science

873
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:00,879
so

874
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:03,119
you know i'm focused on the education

875
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,480
with a little bit of research going on

876
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:06,158
um and

877
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,480
uh then i'm you know to have some

878
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:11,840
administrative tasks like directing the

879
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:15,038
programs and the center

880
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:17,599
but yeah it's it's been really fun and

881
00:32:15,038 --> 00:32:19,919
oh boy have things changed since 2015

882
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:23,038
right in the last seven years we've seen

883
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:24,480
an explosion of cannabis science

884
00:32:23,038 --> 00:32:26,158
you know and

885
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,120
as well as

886
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:29,760
laws

887
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:30,719
pools regulations changing all over the

888
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:34,558
map

889
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,558
um in the us and abroad

890
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,880
yeah well kudos to you guys for kind of

891
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:41,359
starting this process here in the united

892
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,880
states with your courses um

893
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:45,038
i wasn't aware you were the first until

894
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:48,480
i was reading about it uh earlier this

895
00:32:45,038 --> 00:32:50,798
week um can you tell me so if i was a

896
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,558
cultivator and i wanted to learn more

897
00:32:50,798 --> 00:32:53,599
about cultivation

898
00:32:52,558 --> 00:32:55,038
what

899
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:58,798
what would that process look like

900
00:32:55,038 --> 00:33:01,519
through your through your school

901
00:32:58,798 --> 00:33:02,798
right so there's there's

902
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:04,640
two

903
00:33:02,798 --> 00:33:06,398
i call them in-person courses but we can

904
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,840
call them matriculating student courses

905
00:33:06,398 --> 00:33:10,479
that you know you have to be a student

906
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:12,240
or you have to go through the continuing

907
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,919
and distance education which is now

908
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,759
called peace

909
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:18,480
program to enter

910
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:20,640
and and those those you need to be in

911
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,839
person um i mean obviously the last few

912
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:25,679
years they're somewhat offered remotely

913
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:28,558
as the pandemic progresses

914
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:30,880
but one is through the department of

915
00:33:28,558 --> 00:33:33,839
plant and soil science

916
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:36,559
and that is talked by

917
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:38,798
scott lewins and dr heather darby and i

918
00:33:36,558 --> 00:33:42,000
teach it as well um some a few courses

919
00:33:38,798 --> 00:33:43,278
in it and that is focused on

920
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,720
you know

921
00:33:43,278 --> 00:33:46,159
hemp

922
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,640
and then the other is the medical

923
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:50,399
cannabis course that i mentioned

924
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,399
and again that's the in-person

925
00:33:50,398 --> 00:33:55,278
pharmacology course focused on the

926
00:33:52,398 --> 00:33:58,079
effects of cannabis on the human body

927
00:33:55,278 --> 00:34:00,000
but then we have online so anyone can

928
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:02,720
sign up

929
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,398
you know we ask that you have a bachelor

930
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,720
degree in science but we waive that

931
00:34:04,398 --> 00:34:09,598
requirement frequently for people that

932
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:11,599
are willing to make the effort to get up

933
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:14,159
to speed so that they understand the

934
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:15,599
science enough in the courses and people

935
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:17,919
definitely do you know a diverse

936
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:20,559
background we have a lot of

937
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:22,719
you know we have pharmacologists and

938
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:25,358
uh retired you know medical

939
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:26,158
professionals as well as

940
00:34:25,358 --> 00:34:28,799
uh

941
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:31,358
lawyers and business people and we even

942
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,560
have media fellows so we give out media

943
00:34:31,358 --> 00:34:36,000
scholarships

944
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:37,918
each program for members of the media to

945
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,320
take the course for free and then they

946
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:41,838
have to contribute uh after the course a

947
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,440
little bit

948
00:34:41,838 --> 00:34:45,358
and that they might come be a guest

949
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,878
speaker for the next course and share

950
00:34:45,358 --> 00:34:49,199
what they've learned

951
00:34:46,878 --> 00:34:51,440
so so those courses are are wildly

952
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:54,559
accessible we have we run them twice a

953
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,679
year so in the fall and in the spring

954
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:56,559
um

955
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:59,280
and

956
00:34:56,559 --> 00:35:01,358
with that it's basically uh there are

957
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:04,480
pre-recorded lectures so it's

958
00:35:01,358 --> 00:35:05,838
asynchronous as well as synchronous live

959
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,920
sessions but if you miss them that's

960
00:35:05,838 --> 00:35:09,199
okay because they're recorded so it can

961
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,960
be something that you know we've had

962
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:12,078
people from all over the world

963
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,119
thailand

964
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:15,119
um

965
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:16,880
you know all over south america take

966
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:17,920
these courses so we do get a diverse

967
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,000
group

968
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:21,440
and then like i said there's um

969
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,920
sometimes there's webinars there's lots

970
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:26,159
of pre-recorded webinars available and

971
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:28,000
then we have community medical school

972
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:30,639
programs but those again are in person i

973
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,239
don't think they're remote anymore

974
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:34,239
so there's lots of ways to get involved

975
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:36,479
and take these courses at uvm

976
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:37,279
and the nice thing about uvm versus

977
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,480
other

978
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:42,839
programs out there is that we stick to

979
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:44,960
evidence bases so in class we're only

980
00:35:42,838 --> 00:35:46,639
presenting um

981
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:49,039
peer-reviewed published literature or

982
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:52,559
literature that's or research that's

983
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:54,000
ongoing at uvm we try to not you know

984
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:57,279
present

985
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,039
anecdotal and we try to discourage

986
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,960
you know students from

987
00:35:59,039 --> 00:36:03,358
from sharing their anecdotal knowledge

988
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:05,358
without saying this is anecdotal

989
00:36:03,358 --> 00:36:06,639
knowledge and then here's some research

990
00:36:05,358 --> 00:36:08,559
that's backing it up because that's

991
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:10,400
what's so cool is

992
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:11,920
you know people do discover things on

993
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,200
their own and they have you know there's

994
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,880
this wealth of knowledge from people

995
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:16,239
that have been growing for

996
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,160
50 years

997
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:19,598
and then nowadays it seems like some of

998
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:21,199
the research is really backing up what

999
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:23,680
they've already

1000
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:23,679
found out

1001
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:28,639
so i'm looking specifically at the

1002
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,800
cultivation one here it's a professional

1003
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:32,799
certificate in cannabis plant biology is

1004
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,800
that is that the one that you're

1005
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:37,680
referencing in regards to

1006
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:39,839
like say a cultivator who wanted to

1007
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:41,598
take a take a course is that the best

1008
00:36:39,838 --> 00:36:43,279
option

1009
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:45,280
yes so if a cultivator wants to take

1010
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:47,119
course that's the one i suggest actually

1011
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,560
if anyone wanted to take the course that

1012
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:50,160
is the one i would suggest and the

1013
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:53,199
reason why is because that's the one

1014
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:55,118
that dives deep into the plant

1015
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:56,399
it's eight weeks long you know the first

1016
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:59,280
week is just

1017
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:02,079
history business law and policy

1018
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,920
um the basics right and then we go into

1019
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:06,160
basic science and then we deep dive into

1020
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,599
the plan we have a week about

1021
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:10,239
um

1022
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:13,039
cannabis cultivation we have a week

1023
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:16,879
about post harvest we have a week about

1024
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:18,800
extraction and we do have a week about

1025
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,838
how cannabis affects the human body

1026
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:23,519
taught by

1027
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:25,920
uh physicians and pharmacologists

1028
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:28,639
but most of it is focused on the plant

1029
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,760
and in the past then we would offer our

1030
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:32,000
uh

1031
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:34,240
medical cannabis or clinical modules a

1032
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,519
la carte and we're just in the process

1033
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:37,279
of kind of

1034
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:38,800
updating those and we will be offering

1035
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,880
them again so if you took cannabis plant

1036
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:42,400
biology and then you thought oh i really

1037
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:45,358
want to know more how cannabis affects

1038
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:48,079
the human body body you could then go on

1039
00:37:45,358 --> 00:37:50,400
and take you know a module called

1040
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:52,240
cannabis and the endocrine system so i

1041
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,838
would absolutely say for anyone

1042
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:55,838
interested in cultivation start with

1043
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:57,358
plant biology or anyone in general start

1044
00:37:55,838 --> 00:37:59,279
with plant biology unless you're

1045
00:37:57,358 --> 00:38:00,719
specific you know and just want to learn

1046
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,160
about how cannabis affects the human

1047
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:04,399
body

1048
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:07,279
okay well we're recording this right now

1049
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,639
in june it looks like it starts uh end

1050
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:11,760
of september

1051
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:14,319
um it's purely online and an eight-week

1052
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:17,280
program with a time commitment of about

1053
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:19,680
eight to ten hours per week and it's a

1054
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:21,839
non-credit professional certificate does

1055
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:25,039
that i'm just reading off your website

1056
00:38:21,838 --> 00:38:27,920
page does that all sound correct

1057
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:30,800
that yup that is all correct

1058
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:32,800
so yep it wraps right before you know

1059
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,560
the u.s holiday of holiday of

1060
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,839
thanksgiving

1061
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:37,599
and so

1062
00:38:35,838 --> 00:38:40,639
it runs this fall and then it will run

1063
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:41,760
again next spring

1064
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:43,519
oh okay

1065
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,040
and um

1066
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:47,838
i love that you mentioned here that's

1067
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:50,800
fully online evidence-based program uh

1068
00:38:47,838 --> 00:38:51,920
that sounds that sounds wonderful

1069
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:55,200
um

1070
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:56,720
is there what sort of research so you're

1071
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:58,480
many of your professors are teaching and

1072
00:38:56,719 --> 00:39:00,239
then also doing research is there a

1073
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,760
student component to the research as

1074
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:05,838
well or is that

1075
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,839
um i guess how does that work at uvm

1076
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:11,598
yeah so well that's a great question so

1077
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:13,599
because it's fully online you know

1078
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:15,039
the the participants in the program are

1079
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:18,079
not actively

1080
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:19,759
doing research at uvm

1081
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:22,560
you know we we have had a lot of

1082
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:24,240
students come and tour our glasshouse

1083
00:39:22,559 --> 00:39:25,679
facility or

1084
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:28,799
our uh

1085
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:31,440
our field research

1086
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,320
but the student research component of it

1087
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,880
is

1088
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:36,400
in the second to last week we turn the

1089
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,960
you know educational component over to

1090
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:41,358
the student and they design a

1091
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,400
a presentation so we utilize a bunch of

1092
00:39:41,358 --> 00:39:44,239
online

1093
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:47,200
platforms where you know students are

1094
00:39:44,239 --> 00:39:50,319
actually recording themselves doing a uh

1095
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:52,000
a presentation for their peers and a lot

1096
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:54,079
of people think that is

1097
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,159
the best part it's their you know great

1098
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:58,160
learning experience and we do have

1099
00:39:56,159 --> 00:40:01,358
people that are presenting on

1100
00:39:58,159 --> 00:40:03,440
laws or business proposals but a lot of

1101
00:40:01,358 --> 00:40:06,159
people think up research projects and

1102
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:08,639
some of them actually go on to do them

1103
00:40:06,159 --> 00:40:10,960
and so they're getting feedback from

1104
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:12,559
our team of uh

1105
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,679
you know different subject matter

1106
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:14,559
experts

1107
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:17,118
on

1108
00:40:14,559 --> 00:40:19,358
their particular proposed research

1109
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:21,838
and then obviously if they do them we

1110
00:40:19,358 --> 00:40:23,440
want to be involved and hear about each

1111
00:40:21,838 --> 00:40:27,279
step

1112
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:30,400
but as far as hands-on in-person

1113
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:32,640
in the lab the field or the glass house

1114
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,400
this course is not that because

1115
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:36,159
it's online

1116
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,920
sure and what sort of

1117
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:40,000
feedback have you gotten on the course

1118
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:41,440
or any stories of folks who have taken

1119
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,760
the class

1120
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:46,159
and utilized that in their professional

1121
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,160
career

1122
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:50,639
yeah i mean we get we get pretty good

1123
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:53,519
feedback from it it usually fills every

1124
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:56,400
every session and

1125
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:58,079
you know i think people

1126
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:00,559
people like

1127
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:02,079
the learning experience

1128
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:03,440
online you know a lot of people it's

1129
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:05,359
it's new to them

1130
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:07,599
to learn online like that

1131
00:41:05,358 --> 00:41:09,920
um but you know become increasingly

1132
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:11,200
popular in the last few years to learn

1133
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,720
online

1134
00:41:11,199 --> 00:41:14,399
and uh

1135
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:17,039
and yeah i mean we sure you know maybe

1136
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:19,358
what i should do is is tell about some

1137
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:21,679
of the people that we have teaching it

1138
00:41:19,358 --> 00:41:23,920
because um

1139
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:26,480
you know that in itself is

1140
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:29,760
is the value of it people really enjoy

1141
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:31,599
uh getting exposure to the different uh

1142
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:34,240
subject matter experts and professionals

1143
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:35,838
we have and then also the other members

1144
00:41:34,239 --> 00:41:37,519
of the class

1145
00:41:35,838 --> 00:41:39,199
for example in this you know in this

1146
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:41,599
last

1147
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:44,480
plant biology program

1148
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:47,838
we had the

1149
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:48,800
cultural editor from rolling stones and

1150
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:51,599
um

1151
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:54,160
you know a writer for forbes and l.a

1152
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:55,599
times and um

1153
00:41:54,159 --> 00:41:57,920
and then we you know we had we had

1154
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:59,519
people who hadn't ever planted a

1155
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,358
cannabis plant before

1156
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:03,358
we had people

1157
00:42:01,358 --> 00:42:05,838
that you know were well entrenched in

1158
00:42:03,358 --> 00:42:07,598
the industry um you know a lot of a lot

1159
00:42:05,838 --> 00:42:09,759
of times some of my colleagues in the

1160
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:11,359
industry will say oh monique do you know

1161
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:13,280
so-and-so and i'll say oh yeah they took

1162
00:42:11,358 --> 00:42:14,639
my course and now they're running you

1163
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,920
know a cultivation center down in

1164
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:20,078
massachusetts so because it's such a

1165
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:21,280
broad group of students that enter and

1166
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:24,000
participate

1167
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:26,480
what they do afterwards is equally as

1168
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,480
diverse

1169
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:30,000
that's wonderful well

1170
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:32,078
tell me a little bit about the

1171
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,440
professors that you work with and um in

1172
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:34,800
their backgrounds that would be great to

1173
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:39,440
hear

1174
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:41,680
yeah so so i i teach a couple of the um

1175
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:43,599
lectures and you know my background i

1176
00:42:41,679 --> 00:42:45,519
didn't really go super into it because i

1177
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:48,559
said i'm a plant biologist but it's in

1178
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:51,759
um evolution and diversity so i teach

1179
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:54,078
the taxonomy sections i'm really into

1180
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:55,359
the way cannabis is named

1181
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:57,039
and

1182
00:42:55,358 --> 00:42:57,358
you know

1183
00:42:57,039 --> 00:42:59,119
you i

1184
00:42:57,358 --> 00:43:01,598

cannabis research for

1198
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,359
maybe

1199
00:43:29,679 --> 00:43:33,679

the netherlands on

1202
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:44,159
cannabinoids and then we bring in um

1203
00:43:41,199 --> 00:43:45,358
business professor at uvm dr uh william

1204

he's an associate professor

1206
00:43:47,679 --> 00:43:51,118
and he's you know been working on the

1207
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:54,480
medical

1208
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:56,318
side of business for about 25 years

while too

1212
00:43:59,519 --> 00:44:05,440
and then we have um people in in

1213
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:06,400
agronomy like dr heather darby

1214
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:09,200
she's an

1215

and she's been doing hemp research for

1218
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:16,960
um you know

1219
00:44:14,559 --> 00:44:19,358
probably close to 10 years so she

1220
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:22,639
originally had a dei schedule 1 license

1221
00:44:19,358 --> 00:44:25,920
to work on hemp before it was allowed

1222
00:44:22,639 --> 00:44:28,000
to be studied without a dea

1223
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:29,680
schedule one license before i connected

1224
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,280
with you i actually had i was looking

1225
00:44:29,679 --> 00:44:33,440
through my notes and i had her name

1226
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:35,760
listed as someone that i wanted to

1227
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:38,159
connect with for the podcast so i've

1228
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:41,599
i've been hearing her name for years now

1229
00:44:38,159 --> 00:44:43,679
i just i needed to reach out but um yeah

1230
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:46,079
i've heard wonderful things about about

1231
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:47,679
the work that that she's been doing so

1232
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:49,599
that's that's great yeah and a lot of

1233
00:44:47,679 --> 00:44:53,598
the work she he does is with scott

1234
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:55,039
lewins and so he is a um

1235
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:57,599
you know he does like applied

1236
00:44:55,039 --> 00:45:00,000
agricultural research and mostly on

1237
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:02,318
biological control of agricultural pests

1238
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,760
so he also teaches with us

1239
00:45:02,318 --> 00:45:05,358
and then we have

1240
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,960
dr john mckay

1241
00:45:05,358 --> 00:45:10,000
and he's a

1242
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:13,039
a chemical person he

1243
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:15,519
he had his phd in organic chemistry and

1244
00:45:13,039 --> 00:45:17,838
he worked with

1245
00:45:15,519 --> 00:45:20,159
the waters corporation early on when

1246
00:45:17,838 --> 00:45:23,119
they were just starting to do extraction

1247
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:25,279
and um now he's the chief technology

1248
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:27,838
officer new bridge

1249
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:29,760
gold ventures and he's the founder of

1250
00:45:27,838 --> 00:45:32,078
synergistic technology so he's very much

1251
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:36,400
entrenched in the cannabis industry as

1252
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:38,480
well as dr john mcpartland who is a

1253
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,760
family medicine doctor associated with

1254
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:42,079
uvm

1255
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:44,480
but he you know he wrote a book about

1256
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:47,039
cannabis pests and diseases and he's

1257
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:49,920
authored a lot of papers um and so he he

1258
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:51,920
works with us in both programs actually

1259
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:54,559
with his he has a master's in plant

1260
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:56,880
sciences and so he you know he

1261
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:58,159
he does teach some of the the plant

1262
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:00,559
stuff as well as some of the

1263
00:45:58,159 --> 00:46:02,799
endocannabinoid stuff because he is a

1264
00:46:00,559 --> 00:46:05,119
medical professional as well

1265
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:06,640
and then we combined that with some

1266
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:08,400
local

1267
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:10,159
experts that are in the cannabis

1268
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,639
industry

1269
00:46:10,159 --> 00:46:14,960
like the director of one of the labs

1270
00:46:12,639 --> 00:46:16,719
here in vermont and

1271
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:19,440
the director of cultivation of one of

1272
00:46:16,719 --> 00:46:21,919
the dispensaries who used to be in

1273
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:24,000
vermont and now is in massachusetts and

1274
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:25,920
i believe moving to rhode island soon as

1275
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,480
many cultivators do he's making the

1276
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:30,400
rounds at different places so yeah we

1277
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:33,119
blend it we also have a medicinal chem

1278
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:36,160
chemist wolfgang dr dawson dr wolfgang

1279
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:39,519
dachman and a physician scientist so md

1280
00:46:36,159 --> 00:46:41,358
phd dr carla freeman um for you know and

1281
00:46:39,519 --> 00:46:43,920
this is all in the plant biology program

1282
00:46:41,358 --> 00:46:46,400
so as you as you just heard you know we

1283
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:48,559
have kind of people from from lots of

1284
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:52,400
different aspects from business to

1285
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:55,199
medical to chemistry to extraction and

1286
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:56,559
people in the field

1287
00:46:55,199 --> 00:46:58,799
at

1288
00:46:56,559 --> 00:47:01,679
plant soil scientists

1289
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:04,640
and pest management people so we have a

1290
00:47:01,679 --> 00:47:06,559
a great group i think and um

1291
00:47:04,639 --> 00:47:08,799
you know they're they're all doing

1292
00:47:06,559 --> 00:47:10,960
cannabis research kind of on the side or

1293
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:12,640
have some associations with the industry

1294
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:14,800
as well as

1295
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:18,239
some of them have day jobs

1296
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:20,480
in the er at uem or

1297
00:47:18,239 --> 00:47:22,159
studying traumatic brain injury so it's

1298
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:24,480
a great

1299
00:47:22,159 --> 00:47:27,519
a great group and they're all passionate

1300
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:28,800
about helping people uh

1301
00:47:27,519 --> 00:47:31,358
learn more

1302
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:35,200
especially when you have um an

1303
00:47:31,358 --> 00:47:36,639
understudy topic like cannabis science

1304
00:47:35,199 --> 00:47:38,799
that sounds like a wonderful group

1305
00:47:36,639 --> 00:47:40,879
absolutely

1306
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:42,318
quite an extensive background and so

1307
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:44,400
diverse

1308
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:46,960
yeah that it sounds like a great course

1309
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:49,200
um thanks for sharing about that

1310
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:52,400
you know one thing as you were

1311
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:53,598
speaking about your background um well i

1312
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:55,119
had two things i thought were

1313
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:57,280
interesting i thought the taxonomy thing

1314
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:59,440
was interesting and i'd love to touch on

1315
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:00,240
that but what really got me interested

1316
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,920
was

1317
00:48:00,239 --> 00:48:04,959
your background in

1318
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:06,880
in biology and evolution

1319
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,760
um

1320
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:10,720
in

1321
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:12,800
the soils that or i guess soilless media

1322
00:48:10,719 --> 00:48:14,959
that we're using what what the industry

1323
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:16,160
calls living soil but is really

1324
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:18,318
um

1325
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:23,279
probably better described as

1326
00:48:18,318 --> 00:48:25,119
you know very fertile soilless media

1327
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:27,519
we see

1328
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:28,800
a higher

1329
00:48:27,519 --> 00:48:30,400
at least

1330
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:33,200
qualitatively

1331
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:34,800
higher levels of biomass

1332
00:48:33,199 --> 00:48:36,879
and activity

1333
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:39,039
in these

1334
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:41,119
in these living soils

1335
00:48:39,039 --> 00:48:42,880
than i see in traditional agricultural

1336
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:45,280
soils or even you know traditional

1337
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:47,440
soilless media

1338
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:50,240
when we reuse that media

1339
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:53,039
we tend to to get better results on the

1340
00:48:50,239 --> 00:48:55,279
second or third cycle

1341
00:48:53,039 --> 00:48:57,440
i assume as we're establishing more of a

1342
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:59,040
functional ecosystem can you talk a

1343
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:03,159
little bit about

1344
00:48:59,039 --> 00:49:03,159
i guess your thoughts on any of that

1345
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:05,838
yeah

1346
00:49:04,719 --> 00:49:06,879
i guess

1347
00:49:05,838 --> 00:49:08,719
i mean

1348
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:10,559
sure

1349
00:49:08,719 --> 00:49:11,759
i mean when you're talking about that so

1350
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:13,519
so

1351
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:15,920
here's my little secret i also teach in

1352
00:49:13,519 --> 00:49:17,679
the galapagos right because i can't not

1353
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:20,079
do that because i love the galapagos

1354
00:49:17,679 --> 00:49:22,239
islands and as you were talking i was

1355
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:24,400
thinking of

1356
00:49:22,239 --> 00:49:26,318
island evolution galapagos

1357
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:28,720
because yeah when an island emerges

1358
00:49:26,318 --> 00:49:31,358
right the first life on it

1359
00:49:28,719 --> 00:49:32,959
is often lichens and then you get some

1360
00:49:31,358 --> 00:49:33,920
fern establishment

1361
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:36,240
but

1362
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:38,880
it's kind of what i would say you were

1363
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:42,558
using you know the next round is then

1364
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:44,960
you start to get more and more diversity

1365
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:46,640
and so as the island rises so at some of

1366
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:48,318
the highest points on the galapagos

1367
00:49:46,639 --> 00:49:50,799
islands is where we you know find the

1368
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:53,119
most diversity and it's because those

1369
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:54,640
points have been around the longest so

1370
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:56,640
perhaps we can

1371
00:49:54,639 --> 00:50:00,078
relate that to what you just said in

1372
00:49:56,639 --> 00:50:01,118
that you know you're you're using a soil

1373
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:04,000
medium

1374
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:05,519
and soilless cultivation and you know it

1375
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,960
it takes a little time to become

1376
00:50:05,519 --> 00:50:08,159
established because you have those

1377
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,480
pioneers

1378
00:50:08,159 --> 00:50:13,920
that are first colonizing it

1379
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:15,920
and um sometimes it takes those pioneers

1380
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:17,440
to attract other

1381
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:20,318
you know i don't know in this case if

1382
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:22,880
it's microbes or um

1383
00:50:20,318 --> 00:50:25,679
you know abiotic factors for those to

1384
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:27,838
collect you need the pioneers and so

1385
00:50:25,679 --> 00:50:31,118
that you know that would make perfect

1386
00:50:27,838 --> 00:50:32,558
sense from an evolutionary standpoint

1387
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:36,800
and then you probably get to a point

1388
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:39,359
that you know your your medium is not as

1389
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:41,519
useful i'm guessing because some of the

1390
00:50:39,358 --> 00:50:43,519
material is used up by the plant do you

1391
00:50:41,519 --> 00:50:46,318
find that too ted

1392
00:50:43,519 --> 00:50:48,639
well it's interesting and so my my

1393
00:50:46,318 --> 00:50:50,880
bachelor's degree was in anthropology so

1394
00:50:48,639 --> 00:50:52,400
i love that topic

1395
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:54,079
still more on the cultural side but

1396
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:56,160
evolution i think is fascinating and

1397
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:58,559
then one of the people i work with who

1398
00:50:56,159 --> 00:51:01,519
also works at a cannabis facility

1399
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:04,319
dr ben higgins got his phd in functional

1400
00:51:01,519 --> 00:51:06,719
ecology looking at marine systems so

1401
00:51:04,318 --> 00:51:09,039
this is an area that i think is just

1402
00:51:06,719 --> 00:51:11,199
so incredible and the microbial

1403
00:51:09,039 --> 00:51:13,039
level at the microbial level is just

1404
00:51:11,199 --> 00:51:14,639
there's so much we don't know

1405
00:51:13,039 --> 00:51:17,519
um

1406
00:51:14,639 --> 00:51:20,239
so i i really love this topic i

1407
00:51:17,519 --> 00:51:23,358
what we find in in these soils is we use

1408
00:51:20,239 --> 00:51:25,519
a large volume of soil usually in a bed

1409
00:51:23,358 --> 00:51:26,960
rather than a small container and and

1410
00:51:25,519 --> 00:51:28,239
that seems to be critical for

1411
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,679
establishing

1412
00:51:28,239 --> 00:51:32,799
the right

1413
00:51:29,679 --> 00:51:34,558
microbial populations

1414
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:37,359
and as well as managing fertility but

1415
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:38,640
what we see is every cycle you know it's

1416
00:51:37,358 --> 00:51:41,039
since it's

1417
00:51:38,639 --> 00:51:43,039
closed environment agriculture we're

1418
00:51:41,039 --> 00:51:45,679
you know it's not

1419
00:51:43,039 --> 00:51:47,599
we're not getting the same inputs

1420
00:51:45,679 --> 00:51:49,838
into their as we would say

1421
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:51,760
agriculturally outdoors

1422
00:51:49,838 --> 00:51:54,159
you know we're removing organic matter

1423
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:56,240
every cycle removing nutrients and those

1424
00:51:54,159 --> 00:51:59,759
are leaving the facility in the form of

1425
00:51:56,239 --> 00:52:01,838
the cannabis biomass so uh we have to

1426
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:04,400
replace those every cycle

1427
00:52:01,838 --> 00:52:06,159
but we find that we you know if we are

1428
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:08,720
testing the soil

1429
00:52:06,159 --> 00:52:10,960
um and managing the media appropriately

1430
00:52:08,719 --> 00:52:13,358
we can continue this process

1431
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:15,440
um for multiple years with multiple

1432
00:52:13,358 --> 00:52:17,199
cycles per year

1433
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:19,679
you'll provide we're managing pests and

1434
00:52:17,199 --> 00:52:21,039
managing fertility correctly and then we

1435
00:52:19,679 --> 00:52:23,440
don't have to move the media in and out

1436
00:52:21,039 --> 00:52:25,599
of the facility

1437
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:27,358
i don't know from an evolutionary

1438
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:28,800
perspective how

1439
00:52:27,358 --> 00:52:30,639
microbially

1440
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,920
that might may change or may have an

1441
00:52:30,639 --> 00:52:34,799
impact

1442
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:37,358
the biggest issue we've had to face

1443
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:40,640
at least that we're aware of is

1444
00:52:37,358 --> 00:52:43,440
more managing you know sodium when the

1445
00:52:40,639 --> 00:52:44,719
cultivator doesn't have the ability to

1446
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:47,599
have runoff

1447
00:52:44,719 --> 00:52:49,118
based on the design of their facility

1448
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:51,440
that can be a challenge or certain

1449
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:54,960
nutrients can build up or if we get

1450
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:56,639
something awful like a root not nematode

1451
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:58,318
cannabis aphid some of these things

1452
00:52:56,639 --> 00:52:59,838
depending on the facility's ability to

1453
00:52:58,318 --> 00:53:03,039
manage them can be

1454
00:52:59,838 --> 00:53:03,039
a real challenge too

1455
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:10,639
yeah

1456
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:13,200
but around this topic that i think is

1457
00:53:10,639 --> 00:53:14,719
interesting is the the way we would

1458
00:53:13,199 --> 00:53:17,358
research it i think is really really

1459
00:53:14,719 --> 00:53:17,358
tough because

1460
00:53:17,519 --> 00:53:22,719
there's so

1461
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:25,519
it adds such a layer of variability

1462
00:53:22,719 --> 00:53:28,799
to or the number of variables and

1463
00:53:25,519 --> 00:53:31,679
vectors to what traditional

1464
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:34,079
you know agronomy would want to to do at

1465
00:53:31,679 --> 00:53:36,960
a research level um versus you know if i

1466
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:38,880
could do research like uh you know

1467
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:40,800
darren kaplan did with

1468
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:42,720
i think he was using either coco core or

1469
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:45,200
pro mix a fairly inert media and

1470
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:46,959
chemical mineral salts

1471
00:53:45,199 --> 00:53:49,519
that's a much easier experiment for

1472
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:52,400
controlling variables than using this

1473
00:53:49,519 --> 00:53:55,039
biologically active soil

1474
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:57,440
and managing it cycle after cycle so

1475
00:53:55,039 --> 00:53:58,880
this is sort of a situation where

1476
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,679
infield

1477
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:01,599
or

1478
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:04,078
sorry

1479
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:06,400
you know actual production

1480
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:11,680
doesn't really translate well to good

1481
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:14,400
research conditions for academia i guess

1482
00:54:11,679 --> 00:54:16,239
yes it's it well it depends on the

1483
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:18,079
researcher

1484
00:54:16,239 --> 00:54:20,159
you know

1485
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:22,559
people that are used to working in labs

1486
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:25,039
would say there's too many variables

1487
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:26,160
like you just mentioned yes but um i

1488
00:54:25,039 --> 00:54:28,480
mean there's a

1489
00:54:26,159 --> 00:54:30,719
there's also a way to

1490
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:30,719
um

1491
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:35,519
to design your experiment

1492
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:37,520
to you know embrace the variables

1493
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:40,559
instead of try to

1494
00:54:37,519 --> 00:54:42,318
pinpoint them one by one and it does

1495
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:43,920
seem like the cannabis microbiome is

1496
00:54:42,318 --> 00:54:46,480
becoming more popular there's you know

1497
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:47,280
been some publications about it recently

1498
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:49,679
um

1499
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:53,119
we we were actually doing some studies

1500
00:54:49,679 --> 00:54:55,838
of it when uh in the glass houses at uvm

1501
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:57,838
when uh kobe shut us down in march 2020

1502
00:54:55,838 --> 00:55:00,078
and we actually just didn't resume them

1503
00:54:57,838 --> 00:55:02,480
because the young man running them

1504
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:04,000
moved on to a different position

1505
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:06,559
but um

1506
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,480
but people are studying the microbiome

1507
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:09,920
and and you know i'm thinking that's

1508
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:11,838
going to be

1509
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:13,838
uh completely

1510
00:55:11,838 --> 00:55:16,799
correlated to what you're talking about

1511
00:55:13,838 --> 00:55:16,799
too because as you're

1512
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:21,039
studying

1513
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:21,839
the soils and

1514
00:55:21,039 --> 00:55:24,239
you know

1515
00:55:21,838 --> 00:55:26,159
thinking of how do you

1516
00:55:24,239 --> 00:55:27,838
translate that into more specific

1517
00:55:26,159 --> 00:55:29,598
laboratory studies

1518
00:55:27,838 --> 00:55:31,759
um

1519
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:34,640
i think that you know the progress

1520
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:37,119
that's being made genetically where you

1521
00:55:34,639 --> 00:55:38,719
can test your samples that way will help

1522
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:41,519
with it because it will help eliminate

1523
00:55:38,719 --> 00:55:42,959
some of the

1524
00:55:41,519 --> 00:55:44,000
guesswork and what variables are

1525
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:47,599
affecting it because you can know

1526
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:48,719
exactly what's what's there

1527
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:50,400
but

1528
00:55:48,719 --> 00:55:52,719
yeah so like i said i think it depends

1529
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:54,559
on the researcher and that

1530
00:55:52,719 --> 00:55:56,639
some people would shy away from that but

1531
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:58,640
other people would would embrace it

1532
00:55:56,639 --> 00:56:01,199
with a different experimental design

1533
00:55:58,639 --> 00:56:03,679
i think yeah i think about this topic a

1534
00:56:01,199 --> 00:56:05,838
lot so for me it would have to be the

1535
00:56:03,679 --> 00:56:07,519
control is literally just

1536
00:56:05,838 --> 00:56:10,000
that you know what we're calling living

1537
00:56:07,519 --> 00:56:12,559
soil or that enriched media

1538
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,880
rather than trying to

1539
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:17,119
define every variable within the media

1540
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:20,079
itself that would just have to be sort

1541
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:20,960
of the control for the experiment

1542
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:22,960
but

1543
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:25,519
one of the things related to

1544
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:27,519
microbiology is

1545
00:56:25,519 --> 00:56:29,440
in and of itself is the variability so

1546
00:56:27,519 --> 00:56:31,759
you know i saw some research a while

1547
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:36,400
back around

1548
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:38,880
how much fluctuation you get in

1549
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:41,519
soils from a biological perspective in

1550
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:45,039
terms of bacteria and fungi and that

1551
00:56:41,519 --> 00:56:46,719
ratio just based on hydrology

1552
00:56:45,039 --> 00:56:48,239
alone that was the only variable they

1553
00:56:46,719 --> 00:56:49,679
were looking at there

1554
00:56:48,239 --> 00:56:51,759
but there's so many different things in

1555
00:56:49,679 --> 00:56:53,598
terms of rhizosphere interactions

1556
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:56,079
hydrology all these things that affect

1557
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:59,680
tilling that affect

1558
00:56:56,079 --> 00:57:02,000
the biology in the soil how

1559
00:56:59,679 --> 00:57:04,239
do you feel like it's even possible for

1560
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:07,119
us to really um

1561
00:57:04,239 --> 00:57:09,598
ever fully understand what's going on or

1562
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:15,039
make assumptions based off of

1563
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:15,039
the the microbiome in our in our soil

1564
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:18,240
well

1565
00:57:16,159 --> 00:57:19,199
i think

1566
00:57:18,239 --> 00:57:20,558
you know i think i'm going to answer

1567
00:57:19,199 --> 00:57:22,879
that like politician

1568
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:26,400
so i think what you can think is i mean

1569
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:30,160
look at grapes right and so you develop

1570
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:32,960
a chore right and so as cannabis becomes

1571
00:57:30,159 --> 00:57:35,279
accepted as more of an agricultural crop

1572
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:38,000
you instead of trying to pinpoint

1573
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:42,880
exactly what's changing you know the

1574
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:43,599
production of every secondary metabolite

1575
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:47,280
you

1576
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:49,039
you categorize it in some way and you

1577
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:49,920
name it you know

1578
00:57:49,039 --> 00:57:52,000
using

1579
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:54,079
using some kind of system the problem is

1580
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:56,000
i think you have to create a system and

1581
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:57,920
everyone has to agree

1582
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,119
um

1583
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:01,200
and you have to know there's going to be

1584
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:02,880
some inconsistencies

1585
00:58:01,199 --> 00:58:05,838
but you know

1586
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:07,920
that changes when you're trying to

1587
00:58:05,838 --> 00:58:10,798
use something therapeutically right

1588
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:12,240
because you know why not

1589
00:58:10,798 --> 00:58:14,159
wine is not necessarily used

1590
00:58:12,239 --> 00:58:16,000
therapeutically so there's a little bit

1591
00:58:14,159 --> 00:58:17,199
of inconsistency you know they're still

1592
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,679
going to be able to determine the

1593
00:58:17,199 --> 00:58:21,199
alcohol level and so they slap that on

1594
00:58:19,679 --> 00:58:22,798
the bottle but it might not have the

1595
00:58:21,199 --> 00:58:25,118
same

1596
00:58:22,798 --> 00:58:26,719
taste that you would expect but it's not

1597
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:28,079
going to

1598
00:58:26,719 --> 00:58:30,000
change the way

1599
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:31,599
you know it's it's helping somebody

1600
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,838
therapeutically because it's not being

1601
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:35,838
used that way so i think there's two

1602
00:58:33,838 --> 00:58:37,599
factors right and that

1603
00:58:35,838 --> 00:58:39,838
if we really truly want to understand

1604
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:41,200
what's going on in the cannabis plant

1605
00:58:39,838 --> 00:58:43,119
some of it is going to have to be done

1606
00:58:41,199 --> 00:58:45,118
in a very controlled setting

1607
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:48,000
but if we want to think of it as an

1608
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:49,760
agricultural crop and not necessarily

1609
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,760
something that's used

1610
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:53,680
solely therapeutically

1611
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:56,160
then we have to embrace it and just come

1612
00:58:53,679 --> 00:58:58,879
up with you know some kind of

1613
00:58:56,159 --> 00:59:01,598
system that can categorize it like we

1614
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:03,760
have with with wine

1615
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:05,440
so taking that to a microbial level i

1616
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:07,760
know right now that we have

1617
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:10,400
classifications around certain

1618
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:13,040
bacteria for example as being phosphorus

1619
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:17,200
solubilizing or nitrogen fixing

1620
00:59:13,039 --> 00:59:19,599
um so so some of those sort of classes

1621
00:59:17,199 --> 00:59:21,919
already exist

1622
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:25,519
but as i understand it

1623
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:27,519
a lot of times it's a

1624
00:59:25,519 --> 00:59:29,039
i guess a sort of a symbiotic

1625
00:59:27,519 --> 00:59:31,039
relationship where it's more than one

1626
00:59:29,039 --> 00:59:32,719
microbe working together that creates

1627
00:59:31,039 --> 00:59:35,119
the sum of something greater than its

1628
00:59:32,719 --> 00:59:35,118
parts

1629
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:39,599
how do we really begin to classify and

1630
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:42,640
understand

1631
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:42,640
what's going on there

1632
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:47,680
right well with that i mean i think we

1633
00:59:44,798 --> 00:59:49,838
do need to scale back and look at things

1634
00:59:47,679 --> 00:59:53,279
one-on-one for example

1635
00:59:49,838 --> 00:59:55,679
um you know people are using mycorrhizae

1636
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:58,000
with cannabis do they even colonize the

1637
00:59:55,679 --> 01:00:00,798
roots you know i haven't seen

1638
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:02,798
publications that say yes you know

1639
01:00:00,798 --> 01:00:04,719
you could say that if you add

1640
01:00:02,798 --> 01:00:07,358
mycorrhizal to

1641
01:00:04,719 --> 01:00:09,358
the soil that you can get more yield but

1642
01:00:07,358 --> 01:00:11,279
like you're saying there's a lot going

1643
01:00:09,358 --> 01:00:12,318
on in the soil so it might not just be

1644
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:15,920
that

1645
01:00:12,318 --> 01:00:18,960
but if we go really in depth you know

1646
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:22,079
and look microscopically at the roots do

1647
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:24,720
we see uh colonization from

1648
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:26,000
uh mycorrhizae so i think for that you

1649
01:00:24,719 --> 01:00:27,199
know if you if you really want to

1650
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:30,318
science this

1651
01:00:27,199 --> 01:00:32,719
you have to you have to do things um

1652
01:00:30,318 --> 01:00:35,039
you know in a controlled method

1653
01:00:32,719 --> 01:00:36,719
and answer the very basic questions

1654
01:00:35,039 --> 01:00:40,318
first

1655
01:00:36,719 --> 01:00:43,199
like does mycorrhizal colonize

1656
01:00:40,318 --> 01:00:45,838
cannabis roots and then you can move on

1657
01:00:43,199 --> 01:00:47,598
um you know what about rhizobium you

1658
01:00:45,838 --> 01:00:49,358
know are there are there

1659
01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:51,920
are there

1660
01:00:49,358 --> 01:00:54,960
little facts developing like they do uh

1661
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:56,480
in fabaceae so in in the pea family

1662
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:57,599
where you're having nitrogen fixing

1663
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:59,679
bacteria

1664
01:00:57,599 --> 01:01:01,359
probably not i'm guessing but just

1665
01:00:59,679 --> 01:01:05,118
one-on-one like you like like we did

1666
01:01:01,358 --> 01:01:07,119
with all other crops right

1667
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:08,720
i mean that makes sense um

1668
01:01:07,119 --> 01:01:10,880
there's just more and more

1669
01:01:08,719 --> 01:01:12,239
microbial products and biostimulants

1670
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:14,079
coming out

1671
01:01:12,239 --> 01:01:16,399
targeting cannabis and i mean

1672
01:01:14,079 --> 01:01:18,079
agriculture in general it seems to be

1673
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:18,960
the next wave

1674
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:22,400
of

1675
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:26,240
fertilizers and ipm options is really

1676
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:26,240
the microbial stuff

1677
01:01:27,039 --> 01:01:29,599
i don't know i mean i'm excited to see

1678
01:01:28,318 --> 01:01:30,880
where it goes but it also seems like

1679
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:32,559
there's a lot we still don't know and we

1680
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:36,400
may be jumping the gun like you're

1681
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:36,400
suggesting on on some of these products

1682
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:41,358
yeah it's hard to know and it's actually

1683
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:42,798
fairly simple experiments we were doing

1684
01:01:41,358 --> 01:01:44,880
it again when

1685
01:01:42,798 --> 01:01:46,239
uh we were looking specifically and we

1686
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:48,400
actually weren't seeing a ton of

1687
01:01:46,239 --> 01:01:50,399
colonization that's why i bring it up of

1688
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:51,440
mycorrhizal

1689
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:54,318
so

1690
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:56,480
yes but you know we kind of i can't

1691
01:01:54,318 --> 01:01:57,920
that's not published that

1692
01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:00,880
you know hasn't been

1693
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:02,400
repeated and triplicate because um

1694
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:04,960
when the pandemic shut it down we just

1695
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:07,358
never picked up that piece of

1696
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:09,920
of research but it's it's a great

1697
01:02:07,358 --> 01:02:12,078
question right and um you know you

1698
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:12,960
compare it it's an easy experiment you

1699
01:02:12,079 --> 01:02:16,720
plant

1700
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:19,039
uh something that you know is colonized

1701
01:02:16,719 --> 01:02:20,879
alongside cannabis use the same product

1702
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:23,279
look at the roots stain them under a

1703
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:24,559
microscope and see is there is there

1704
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:27,280
colonization

1705
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:29,519
and if there isn't then how could you

1706
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:32,319
say that that particular product is the

1707
01:02:29,519 --> 01:02:34,239
one benefiting cannabis right

1708
01:02:32,318 --> 01:02:36,079
and you know it's a simple experiment

1709
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:38,239
and i don't think it's been done yet i

1710
01:02:36,079 --> 01:02:40,559
haven't seen a publication but um it

1711
01:02:38,239 --> 01:02:43,279
could have popped up recently

1712
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:45,200
so like i said you know we just we have

1713
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:47,839
publications now on

1714
01:02:45,199 --> 01:02:50,480
um cannabis microbiome so we know what's

1715
01:02:47,838 --> 01:02:53,599
going on there at least

1716
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:56,240
yeah you know i was very skeptical of

1717
01:02:53,599 --> 01:02:59,280
mycorrhizal fungus in cannabis due to

1718
01:02:56,239 --> 01:03:01,358
the short crop cycle and high p levels

1719
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:03,680
in our soils and some of those and uh

1720
01:03:01,358 --> 01:03:05,759
the rampant use of

1721
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:06,719
various trichoderma

1722
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:08,400
um

1723
01:03:06,719 --> 01:03:10,719
but then i spoke to

1724
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:12,240
dr joram capulnick i had him on the

1725
01:03:10,719 --> 01:03:14,639
podcast he's a

1726
01:03:12,239 --> 01:03:17,038
mycorrhizae research out of israel

1727
01:03:14,639 --> 01:03:18,960
and uh he kind of changed my mind on it

1728
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:21,359
but again i haven't actually seen a lot

1729
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:23,599
of public research public

1730
01:03:21,358 --> 01:03:25,358
published research sorry on this topic

1731
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:26,640
either um

1732
01:03:25,358 --> 01:03:28,400
can i can you explain a little more

1733
01:03:26,639 --> 01:03:31,038
about what you

1734
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:33,519
what you guys found so you were using a

1735
01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:34,280
commercially available

1736
01:03:33,519 --> 01:03:36,079
um

1737
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:37,760
endomycorrhizal

1738
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:39,440
product i'm guessing

1739
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:41,200
um

1740
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:42,720
and it and you weren't getting

1741
01:03:41,199 --> 01:03:44,399
yeah

1742
01:03:42,719 --> 01:03:45,919
um infection you know and i should

1743
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:47,200
probably take a step back on that

1744
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:49,599
because

1745
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:50,558
again it was like such in its infancy

1746
01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:53,359
when

1747
01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:55,359
when that when that research program got

1748
01:03:53,358 --> 01:03:56,719
shut down um just because you know

1749
01:03:55,358 --> 01:04:00,159
people

1750
01:03:56,719 --> 01:04:03,038
um stopped coming into the glass houses

1751
01:04:00,159 --> 01:04:05,118
and we just never took it back up

1752
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:07,440
but um

1753
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:10,000
yeah i mean we were applying i'd have to

1754
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:13,119
go back look back in my notes it wasn't

1755
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:15,119
me doing it it was a research assistant

1756
01:04:13,119 --> 01:04:17,119
and he was applying commercially

1757
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:19,280
available products and looking at him

1758
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:21,838
under a microscope and comparing them

1759
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:24,160
i think the plants that he was using as

1760
01:04:21,838 --> 01:04:25,279
the control um i actually don't remember

1761
01:04:24,159 --> 01:04:27,199
which one

1762
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:28,880
has to control so this is this is

1763
01:04:27,199 --> 01:04:30,719
something that i probably shouldn't go

1764
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:32,240
into because i don't i don't remember

1765
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:33,679
enough about it it's been a long two

1766
01:04:32,239 --> 01:04:34,798
years

1767
01:04:33,679 --> 01:04:35,679
but

1768
01:04:34,798 --> 01:04:36,880
yes

1769
01:04:35,679 --> 01:04:37,219
so

1770
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:38,640
um

1771
01:04:37,219 --> 01:04:41,118
[Music]

1772
01:04:38,639 --> 01:04:43,519
it was seeming like

1773
01:04:41,119 --> 01:04:45,680
their whatever product we were using was

1774
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:48,318
not um

1775
01:04:45,679 --> 01:04:50,639
going to really uh

1776
01:04:48,318 --> 01:04:52,480
be present in the roots

1777
01:04:50,639 --> 01:04:53,679
well you know regardless of the results

1778
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:56,798
of the research you bring up this

1779
01:04:53,679 --> 01:04:56,798
interesting point though that

1780
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:02,240
you know we do at the end of the day

1781
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,519
if we can default to available research

1782
01:05:02,239 --> 01:05:05,118
that's always a good idea and if the

1783
01:05:03,519 --> 01:05:07,599
research doesn't exist it's always

1784
01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:10,160
something we can test ourselves and even

1785
01:05:07,599 --> 01:05:12,559
if you don't have the ability to

1786
01:05:10,159 --> 01:05:14,639
you know stain roots under a microscope

1787
01:05:12,559 --> 01:05:16,798
you can absolutely trial

1788
01:05:14,639 --> 01:05:19,440
in you know mycorrhizal fungus in your

1789
01:05:16,798 --> 01:05:21,440
facility on some of your crop and not on

1790
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:23,440
others and see if you get a plant

1791
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:26,159
response in regards to disease

1792
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:28,000
resistance or

1793
01:05:26,159 --> 01:05:30,719
biomass increases that make it

1794
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:33,039
worthwhile to use it rather than just

1795
01:05:30,719 --> 01:05:34,798
you know blanketly applying all of these

1796
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:36,880
products and assuming that you're

1797
01:05:34,798 --> 01:05:37,838
getting a certain result based on a

1798
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:41,440
you know

1799
01:05:37,838 --> 01:05:41,440
sales pitch or something for example so

1800
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:47,599
yeah yeah chad i agree with you applying

1801
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:49,519
the scientific method is always a good

1802
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:51,519
idea when you're trying new products but

1803
01:05:49,519 --> 01:05:53,599
i know that people can't always do that

1804
01:05:51,519 --> 01:05:56,480
and um

1805
01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:58,240
but yeah i mean i think you know we had

1806
01:05:56,480 --> 01:06:00,400
talked to a lot of different lighting

1807
01:05:58,239 --> 01:06:02,239
companies too and it was the same thing

1808
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:05,760
people were claiming that certain

1809
01:06:02,239 --> 01:06:07,838
spectra did this in the that

1810
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:11,119
but the research isn't really there to

1811
01:06:07,838 --> 01:06:12,400
back it up so um you know

1812
01:06:11,119 --> 01:06:14,798
using a different wavelength on the

1813
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:17,200
plant definitely has an effect but if we

1814
01:06:14,798 --> 01:06:19,440
can't definitively say what that effect

1815
01:06:17,199 --> 01:06:21,519
is you know maybe you don't want to go

1816
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:24,159
ahead and switch all your lighting to a

1817
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:26,318
different wavelength um

1818
01:06:24,159 --> 01:06:27,679
and it's hard because this is

1819
01:06:26,318 --> 01:06:29,440
you know i feel like with the whole

1820
01:06:27,679 --> 01:06:30,558
cannabis industry everything got ahead

1821
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:32,798
of itself

1822
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:35,039
right it's the same with

1823
01:06:32,798 --> 01:06:36,000
medicinal cannabis used therapeutically

1824
01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:38,960
is

1825
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:41,280
a lot of anecdotal information was put

1826
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:43,838
out there and you know states were

1827
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:45,839
making rules and regulations

1828
01:06:43,838 --> 01:06:47,038
and they were having to go off uh

1829
01:06:45,838 --> 01:06:49,038
anecdotal

1830
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:51,200
evidence um

1831
01:06:49,039 --> 01:06:54,720
that isn't necessarily

1832
01:06:51,199 --> 01:06:57,118
uh true when it's when it's tried um

1833
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:58,719
and replicated using the

1834
01:06:57,119 --> 01:07:02,880
scientific method there's just no

1835
01:06:58,719 --> 01:07:04,558
scientific rigor or truth to it

1836
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:06,240
yeah well i know i know we're getting

1837
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:07,920
short on time would you have time to

1838
01:07:06,239 --> 01:07:10,558
just talk a little bit about cannabis

1839
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:12,079
taxonomy and sort of um

1840
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:14,880
your thoughts

1841
01:07:12,079 --> 01:07:16,640
on it um we've had people on the past

1842
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:19,039
talking sort of about how

1843
01:07:16,639 --> 01:07:21,598
this idea of um

1844
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:23,119
indica and sativa are is not accurate

1845
01:07:21,599 --> 01:07:25,200
and sort of an outdated

1846
01:07:23,119 --> 01:07:26,720
terminology um

1847
01:07:25,199 --> 01:07:29,519
can do you have time to just shed a

1848
01:07:26,719 --> 01:07:31,679
little bit light on on that topic though

1849
01:07:29,519 --> 01:07:34,639
from a taxonomy perspective i always

1850
01:07:31,679 --> 01:07:37,838
have time to talk about taxonomy

1851
01:07:34,639 --> 01:07:39,358
absolutely and i am wishing i you know

1852
01:07:37,838 --> 01:07:42,239
had had reviewed some of those earlier

1853
01:07:39,358 --> 01:07:45,519
podcasts to 50 people's opinions i can

1854
01:07:42,239 --> 01:07:47,038
say one thing we absolutely teach in our

1855
01:07:45,519 --> 01:07:49,119
in all of our programs

1856
01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:51,200
is that scientifically

1857
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:54,640
the species uh

1858
01:07:51,199 --> 01:07:57,759
cannabis is cannabis sativa l

1859
01:07:54,639 --> 01:07:59,279
we don't you know we don't uh

1860
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:00,799
we don't teach cannabis indica we teach

1861
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:04,160
about it that

1862
01:08:00,798 --> 01:08:06,480
you know lamerick used it when he

1863
01:08:04,159 --> 01:08:07,838
named uh the plant

1864
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:08,719
um

1865
01:08:07,838 --> 01:08:11,679
you know

1866
01:08:08,719 --> 01:08:14,399
dr mcpartlin actually gives

1867
01:08:11,679 --> 01:08:16,880
some taxonomy information he's published

1868
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:18,480
uh in that area as well

1869
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:19,600
and um

1870
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:21,599
you know he

1871
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:23,920
he goes into great detail in one of his

1872
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:25,520
publications about

1873
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:27,838
some of the problems with those

1874
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:30,080
scientific names that are out there

1875
01:08:27,838 --> 01:08:32,479
and the truth is you know it doesn't

1876
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:33,838
seem like anyone has been able to

1877
01:08:32,479 --> 01:08:35,278
morphologically

1878
01:08:33,838 --> 01:08:37,759
genetically

1879
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:40,400
or chemically

1880
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:42,238
categorize plants as cannabis indica or

1881
01:08:40,399 --> 01:08:44,879
cannabis sativa

1882
01:08:42,238 --> 01:08:47,678
in any kind of consistent fashion

1883
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:49,920
and so if you want to use cannabis

1884
01:08:47,679 --> 01:08:52,079
indica and sativa

1885
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:54,079
in kind of this popular vernacular as

1886
01:08:52,079 --> 01:08:56,399
it's used right now in

1887
01:08:54,079 --> 01:08:58,640
dispensaries

1888
01:08:56,399 --> 01:09:01,358
that's a different story but the problem

1889
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:02,400
is you know if you look at the way it's

1890
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:04,560
used

1891
01:09:02,399 --> 01:09:06,559
and you then try to

1892
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:08,960
look at the chemicals that are found in

1893
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:11,199
those plants there's nothing that really

1894
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:14,560
is categorizing things as indica and

1895
01:09:11,198 --> 01:09:16,399
sativa consistently chemically

1896
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:18,400
and like i said morphologically or

1897
01:09:16,399 --> 01:09:21,519
genetically so those names should really

1898
01:09:18,399 --> 01:09:23,278
not be applied and um there's there's a

1899
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:26,000
funny there's a funny thing we talk

1900
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:28,319
about in our classes because i think dr

1901
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:30,000
mcpartlin pointed it out um in one of

1902
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:31,839
his publications is

1903
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,838
that you know

1904
01:09:31,838 --> 01:09:35,039
one cannabis cup had i'm forgetting the

1905
01:09:33,838 --> 01:09:36,798
strain name

1906
01:09:35,039 --> 01:09:39,759
and let's say

1907
01:09:36,798 --> 01:09:42,238
jack herrera win as a sativa and then

1908
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:43,520
two years later it won as an indica

1909
01:09:42,238 --> 01:09:46,399
so

1910
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:48,719
yeah yeah so i mean that's the problem

1911
01:09:46,399 --> 01:09:50,879
right there and and

1912
01:09:48,719 --> 01:09:52,640
maybe you know it's a it's kind of a

1913
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:54,239
placebo effect where somebody thinks

1914
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:55,679
they're getting something uplifting

1915
01:09:54,238 --> 01:09:57,359
because it's sativa and then it makes

1916
01:09:55,679 --> 01:09:59,520
them feel uplifted

1917
01:09:57,359 --> 01:10:02,319
but there just isn't really a scientific

1918
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:03,679
basis to it right now

1919
01:10:02,319 --> 01:10:06,158
that makes sense and it seems like

1920
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:08,560
genetically all these plants are so

1921
01:10:06,158 --> 01:10:10,960
mixed now um

1922
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:12,560
there really isn't anything that one

1923
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:15,279
could say is

1924
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:16,560
purely one or the other but you know we

1925
01:10:15,279 --> 01:10:17,840
for years

1926
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:19,440
you know people would say oh that

1927
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:21,360
plant's a sativa based on its growth

1928
01:10:19,439 --> 01:10:23,439
habit or based on the

1929
01:10:21,359 --> 01:10:26,399
the therapeutic effects they may receive

1930
01:10:23,439 --> 01:10:27,919
from it um and vice versa

1931
01:10:26,399 --> 01:10:29,679
and it was always the assumption and it

1932
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:30,960
wasn't until um

1933
01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:32,239
well frankly until i talked to some

1934
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:34,480
people on this podcast that i really

1935
01:10:32,238 --> 01:10:36,158
learned the difference there and

1936
01:10:34,479 --> 01:10:39,039
interestingly enough what we're seeing

1937
01:10:36,158 --> 01:10:39,920
from a consumer perspective

1938
01:10:39,039 --> 01:10:43,119
with

1939
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:46,319
blind blind research is that folks

1940
01:10:43,119 --> 01:10:48,719
when you know people are using thc as a

1941
01:10:46,319 --> 01:10:50,238
purchasing decision in terms of higher

1942
01:10:48,719 --> 01:10:52,319
ghc being

1943
01:10:50,238 --> 01:10:54,238
better but when consumers when you take

1944
01:10:52,319 --> 01:10:56,079
away the thc percentage and just give

1945
01:10:54,238 --> 01:10:57,198
them

1946
01:10:56,079 --> 01:10:59,519
the cannabis

1947
01:10:57,198 --> 01:11:02,158
uh through a double-blind study the ones

1948
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:04,480
that are having the best effects are not

1949
01:11:02,158 --> 01:11:07,039
the highest thc

1950
01:11:04,479 --> 01:11:09,439
products um which

1951
01:11:07,039 --> 01:11:11,039
is interesting so um i'm hoping the

1952
01:11:09,439 --> 01:11:12,000
industry will change its terminology and

1953
01:11:11,039 --> 01:11:12,800
come up with something that's a little

1954
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
bit

1955
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:15,920
better but i don't know what that looks

1956
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:17,439
like i've had some longer conversations

1957
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:20,239
with folks

1958
01:11:17,439 --> 01:11:24,000
way uh way smarter on this topic than me

1959
01:11:20,238 --> 01:11:26,158
but i think it's really interesting

1960
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:28,719
yeah i mean it's a problem it's you know

1961
01:11:26,158 --> 01:11:30,319
when when you have an industry that

1962
01:11:28,719 --> 01:11:32,800
has this deep roots

1963
01:11:30,319 --> 01:11:34,639
and some of them aren't based on um you

1964
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:36,880
know what what

1965
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:40,719
uh nestian industries are you know

1966
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:42,319
usually based on is oversight and um

1967
01:11:40,719 --> 01:11:43,439
rules

1968
01:11:42,319 --> 01:11:44,799
then

1969
01:11:43,439 --> 01:11:47,039
you have something that's hard to get

1970
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:48,880
rid of and the truth is

1971
01:11:47,039 --> 01:11:51,600
i don't know you know i'm not in

1972
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:54,159
marketing at all and i have no idea how

1973
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:59,440
you would convince

1974
01:11:54,158 --> 01:12:01,759
consumers to not want stream names or

1975
01:11:59,439 --> 01:12:04,319
indica or sativa

1976
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:06,239
but yes the truth is you know

1977
01:12:04,319 --> 01:12:08,719
there's published literature out there

1978
01:12:06,238 --> 01:12:11,439
where people have tried to separate out

1979
01:12:08,719 --> 01:12:13,760
indicas and sativas out of you know

1980
01:12:11,439 --> 01:12:16,238
dispensaries in california for example

1981
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:18,400
and there's no consistency um and then

1982
01:12:16,238 --> 01:12:20,000
even strain names you know what you're

1983
01:12:18,399 --> 01:12:22,000
getting

1984
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:23,679
at one dispensary under one straining is

1985
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,880
definitely not what you're getting at it

1986
01:12:23,679 --> 01:12:26,960
at another

1987
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:29,039
and part of it goes back to the growing

1988
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:31,279
process so say you have a genetically

1989
01:12:29,039 --> 01:12:32,319
identical plant but it's grown in

1990
01:12:31,279 --> 01:12:34,719
different

1991
01:12:32,319 --> 01:12:36,639
uh methodologies even you know say

1992
01:12:34,719 --> 01:12:38,880
nutrients

1993
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:41,760
light wavelength

1994
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:44,000
time of harvest or even

1995
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:45,520
post harvest the way it's stored those

1996
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:47,679
can all affect the chemicals in it and

1997
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:50,000
make it that you have an inconsistent

1998
01:12:47,679 --> 01:12:52,158
product that's labeled the theme and

1999
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:54,719
that's the problem is all if all you're

2000
01:12:52,158 --> 01:12:58,399
labeling it is these names so it's not

2001
01:12:54,719 --> 01:12:58,399
the same thing because they're

2002
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:03,679
the botanical rules of nomenclature are

2003
01:13:01,359 --> 01:13:05,439
not being followed

2004
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:06,399
there is you know a cultivated plant

2005
01:13:05,439 --> 01:13:09,198
code

2006
01:13:06,399 --> 01:13:12,559
and there are you know temp cultivars

2007
01:13:09,198 --> 01:13:14,399
but we are not there with with marijuana

2008
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:16,320
um but to be clear i think you can tell

2009
01:13:14,399 --> 01:13:18,639
apart hemp and marijuana right our our

2010
01:13:16,319 --> 01:13:19,759
government thinks so too by by setting

2011
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:22,000
this limit

2012
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:24,079
on the amount of thc

2013
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:26,399
and there does seem to be two groupings

2014
01:13:24,079 --> 01:13:28,640
of plants ones that are high in thc and

2015
01:13:26,399 --> 01:13:30,639
ones that are low and now clearly

2016
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:32,880
there's all sorts of hybrids but going

2017
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:35,520
back to the indica and sativa debate i

2018
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:38,159
think that's going to be a hard one

2019
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:40,960
to ever really truly separate and if

2020
01:13:38,158 --> 01:13:44,238
there ever were two

2021
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:47,520
different cannabis species before

2022
01:13:44,238 --> 01:13:49,439
you know they were domesticated

2023
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:52,640
i think it would be really hard to to

2024
01:13:49,439 --> 01:13:55,839
un-domesticate them at this point and

2025
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:59,360
go back to you know their ancestral

2026
01:13:55,840 --> 01:14:01,199
forms um because

2027
01:13:59,359 --> 01:14:02,799
right now everything can hybridize

2028
01:14:01,198 --> 01:14:04,399
marijuana and hemp can hybridize you

2029
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:06,480
know every strain can hybridize and

2030
01:14:04,399 --> 01:14:09,679
produce a viable offspring

2031
01:14:06,479 --> 01:14:11,198
and that is the very basic concept of

2032
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:13,199
you know the definition of a species

2033
01:14:11,198 --> 01:14:15,359
it's the biological species concept if

2034
01:14:13,198 --> 01:14:18,879
you can have two organisms

2035
01:14:15,359 --> 01:14:22,399
mate and produce a viable offspring

2036
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:23,279
then you don't have separate units

2037
01:14:22,399 --> 01:14:26,399
and

2038
01:14:23,279 --> 01:14:28,639
in that case species

2039
01:14:26,399 --> 01:14:29,759
yeah i mean even the use of the term

2040
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:33,199
strain

2041
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:35,360
versus uh cultivar is really um just an

2042
01:14:33,198 --> 01:14:37,759
example of the nomenclature in our

2043
01:14:35,359 --> 01:14:39,759
industry and how

2044
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:43,760
how you know what's become common is not

2045
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:45,280
necessarily what's botanically correct

2046
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:46,880
exactly yes

2047
01:14:45,279 --> 01:14:49,840
so yeah this correct term would be

2048
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:52,560
cultivar but you have to prove um

2049
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:54,400
you know consistency with cultivars and

2050
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:56,159
that you know you're getting something

2051
01:14:54,399 --> 01:14:57,759
that's considered a cultivar and you

2052
01:14:56,158 --> 01:14:58,879
plant it you can know what you would

2053
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:00,640
expect

2054
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:03,600
and

2055
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:05,920
cannabis industry is not there so this

2056
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:07,920
main strain which actually has no i

2057
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:09,760
don't even know the origin of why we

2058
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:12,480
call things strains but it doesn't seem

2059
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:14,800
there's nothing scientific about it

2060
01:15:12,479 --> 01:15:17,279
i think because of things like bacteria

2061
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:18,960
it probably just was a carryover from

2062
01:15:17,279 --> 01:15:21,519
from there right yeah

2063
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:24,480
and black market um

2064
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:25,920
i don't know but um wouldn't it be

2065
01:15:24,479 --> 01:15:28,799
called a cultivar because it's not a

2066
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:31,119
variety because it is a it is something

2067
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:33,440
that's been cultivated

2068
01:15:31,119 --> 01:15:35,439
by humans um

2069
01:15:33,439 --> 01:15:36,719
with an intended purpose as i understand

2070
01:15:35,439 --> 01:15:38,960
it from botanical perspective but i

2071
01:15:36,719 --> 01:15:40,399
could be wrong what else what else would

2072
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:42,000
we call it

2073
01:15:40,399 --> 01:15:43,759
even with the genetic diversity that you

2074
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,279
see across

2075
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:48,960
you know given plant you'll call

2076
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:49,840
something a cultivar once it hits

2077
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:52,000
that

2078
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:52,880
you know

2079
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:55,520
kind of

2080
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:57,199
standardization that a cultivar would

2081
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:58,719
require because that is you know

2082
01:15:57,198 --> 01:16:00,960
cultivars

2083
01:15:58,719 --> 01:16:02,880
um

2084
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:04,800
it doesn't so you have it you have a

2085
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:06,239
species right and

2086
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:08,800
then you'd have a cultivar so if we take

2087
01:16:06,238 --> 01:16:11,359
corn for example like vmas and then if

2088
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:13,920
you're buying a cultivar of vmas you'll

2089
01:16:11,359 --> 01:16:15,839
have that half per that half parenthese

2090
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:17,199
and it will say like super sweet

2091
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:18,640
right and so that's eventually what

2092
01:16:17,198 --> 01:16:20,559
cannabis should be it should be cannabis

2093
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:22,640
sativa with

2094
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:24,239
the cultivar name um and that's you know

2095
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:26,239
that's what people would be

2096
01:16:24,238 --> 01:16:28,000
used to buying in

2097
01:16:26,238 --> 01:16:30,799
current agriculture

2098
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:32,319
is a cultivar and you plant super sweet

2099
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:33,679
and you're not going to get flower corn

2100
01:16:32,319 --> 01:16:37,279
right you're going to get corn on the

2101
01:16:33,679 --> 01:16:39,119
cob that you eat yeah yeah

2102
01:16:37,279 --> 01:16:41,279
but yeah that's that's not really

2103
01:16:39,119 --> 01:16:42,880
happening with with marijuana right now

2104
01:16:41,279 --> 01:16:46,158
um

2105
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:47,600
uh hemp you can definitely import

2106
01:16:46,158 --> 01:16:48,799
hemp seeds like

2107
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:50,960
for example

2108
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:52,960
is a cultivar of hemp

2109
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:54,079
and you can get what you expect

2110
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:54,800
um

2111
01:16:54,079 --> 01:16:58,399
but

2112
01:16:54,800 --> 01:17:00,159
and i think part of that goes back to

2113
01:16:58,399 --> 01:17:03,839
following the

2114
01:17:00,158 --> 01:17:05,839
rules for uh the botanical nomenclature

2115
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:08,400
because there's ones for cultivars too

2116
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:10,480
um and then and then oversight of

2117
01:17:08,399 --> 01:17:11,839
following those rules

2118
01:17:10,479 --> 01:17:13,279
that's i didn't know i didn't know all

2119
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:14,480
that that's really interesting yeah

2120
01:17:13,279 --> 01:17:15,439
thank you

2121
01:17:14,479 --> 01:17:17,039
yeah

2122
01:17:15,439 --> 01:17:18,399
um well

2123
01:17:17,039 --> 01:17:21,039
we've been talking for quite a while i

2124
01:17:18,399 --> 01:17:22,399
know you're you're busy um

2132
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:36,800
that you mentioned as well and

2133
