00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:19,118
so

3
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,039
welcome to the cannabis cultivation and

4
00:00:19,118 --> 00:00:23,359
science podcast i'm your host

5
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,960
tad hussey of kiss organics this is the

6
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,560
podcast where we discuss the cutting

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,359
edge of growing from a science-based

8
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:29,038
perspective

9
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,400
and drawn top experts from around the

10
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,359
industry to share their wisdom and

11
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:33,119
knowledge

12
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:36,399
this week's podcast is a bit different

13
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:38,320
though it's not a podcast on cultivation

14
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,679
right now we are facing unprecedented

15
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,799
times here in the united states and

16
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:42,558
around the world

17
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:44,320
many people are suffering either from

18
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:45,839
economic hardship or the racial

19
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,679
injustice that's bubbled up over the

20
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,960
past couple of months sparked by police

21
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:50,479
brutality

22
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,000
now i'm not here to tell folks what to

23
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:53,359
believe there's enough of that going

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,119
around these days

25
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:56,640
all i would suggest is that for those of

26
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:58,000
us who are fortunate enough to still

27
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,920
have jobs and making ends

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,600
meet it's a very good time to give back

29
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,039
to your community and there are a lot of

30
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,640
good causes out there

31
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,320
pick one that speaks to you and try to

32
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,560
give something back

33
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:10,000
along that vein kiss organics is going

34
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,560
to be contributing this year to the

35
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,799
flint unity farming project the founder

36
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,400
delma marshall is my guest this week and

37
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,080

hey thanks for having me yeah i wanted

43
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,880
to start off can you tell me a little

44
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,079
bit about yourself

45
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:34,000
and then we'll talk a little bit more

46
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:35,199
about flint michigan and the unity

47
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,280
project but but tell me a little bit

48
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,400
about yourself first

49
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:43,280
okay well as for me uh i'm an

50
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,320
army brat uh child uh my dad was in the

51
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,439
service

52
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:50,158
his last uh post was michigan so

53
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:52,078
michigan became our home but we're

54
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,118
actually from

55
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:59,199
vicksburg mississippi and uh

56
00:01:55,118 --> 00:02:02,000
jackson mississippi so and there we

57
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,880
had a farm so farming was just something

58
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,920
that

59
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:09,280
we were always around but far

60
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,199
away from so i'm a three-sport athlete

61
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,598
my dad was a tennis coach i played

62
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:17,519
tennis basketball football

63
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:20,560
uh and sports is made like part of

64
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:23,840
my my life and agriculture is like the

65
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,439
other side of it you know

66
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,080
yeah you know i was kind of the same way

67
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:30,959
i got really into sports in college

68
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,319
i played in college myself and then uh

69
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,598
it's funny because most people don't

70
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:36,238
associate

71
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:38,159
athleticism with agriculture they don't

72
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,800
typically go together i mean they're not

73
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:41,759
opposed but it is a funny that there is

74
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,680
that sort of

75
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:45,439
gap there between where our food comes

76
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,959
from and people that are really

77
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:52,000
interested in exercise and nutrition

78
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,039
right and it seems like they would go

79
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,479
together but

80
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:59,759
no oddly not so with at with uh

81
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:01,679
athletes their optimal thing is what

82
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:04,239
what they're eating in order to enhance

83
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,040
their performance so if you're in

84
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,560
agriculture you're growing what a person

85
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:10,719
would be eating so

86
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,680
it's pretty much along those same same

87
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:14,719
lines like they

88
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:17,599
go together so our pro program

89
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:19,840
our youth gardening and fitness program

90
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:21,199
is to do just that is to teach kids how

91
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,560
to eat properly

92
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:27,439
and then exercise to fight uh child

93
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,360
obesity because uh the overweight

94
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:32,400
problem is one of the biggest things

95
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,080
in the united states with kids and so we

96
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,239
want to teach them how to be

97
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,440
responsible with their weight and with

98
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,599
fitness at an early age

99
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:43,598
yeah now you started the flint unity

100
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:45,199
farming project and i want to talk about

101
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:47,679
that but before we do can you

102
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:49,598
give listeners a little background into

103
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,920
i mean the flint michigan so

104
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:53,919
most people have heard of the water

105
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:55,280
crisis in michigan and i'd like to if

106
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:57,598
you could just

107
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,360
kind of uh give an overview of what that

108
00:03:57,598 --> 00:03:59,840
is but then also tell us what it's like

109
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,599
in flint

110
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,759
also you know through the the water

111
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:05,119
crisis and even now as you guys are

112
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:06,878
still battling that

113
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,039
um can you talk a little bit about the

114
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:11,359
about the water crisis

115
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:12,239
oh yeah well definitely well uh flint

116
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,280
flint michigan

117
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:18,160
is uh probably one of the third

118
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,639
largest cities in the state of michigan

119
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,680
and

120
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,720
it's a lot of problems that come along

121
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,280
with it and

122
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,400
you know there's a communities of people

123
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:29,439
here i'm from

124
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:32,638
you know was raised here in michigan

125
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:35,199
and for whatever reason it is uh

126
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,040
you know bad things happen and that the

127
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,478
community itself needs needs help

128
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:43,280
flint used to be a haven for nba

129
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:44,478
players uh nfl players like back in the

130
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:47,599
early 80s

131
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:49,839
90s with glenn rice and andre rising

132
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,199
and it seemed like since those star

133
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:54,399
people left

134
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:56,560
the city is is still here and it's in

135
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:58,799
uh shambles like it's in economic

136
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,280
shambles i don't know who's to

137
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,840
you know who's who's supposed to blame

138
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:04,399
for

139
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:05,119
what what happened but there's still

140
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:07,038
people here

141
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,800
and and everything is bad like the

142
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:11,038
school system is bad they don't have

143
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:14,160
enough money to keep the schools open

144
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:17,439
like it's just a real like

145
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,439
messed up uh situation but you still

146
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,918
have people who do not have enough money

147
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:23,120
to

148
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:24,000
move away that's here and then those are

149
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,840
the people that we're

150
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,439
trying to help the ones that here trying

151
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:30,560
to inspire them

152
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:34,478
through the bad uh basically

153
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:37,120
eight years of uh slim water crisis

154
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:39,758
so take me back to the to it started

155
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,079
what in april of 2014

156
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,400
uh flint changed they began drawing

157
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:46,319
water directly from the flint river

158
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:48,560
for the hundred thousand residents there

159
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:51,759
instead of water coming from detroit

160
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:54,720
and uh residents started complaining of

161
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,720
the water changing in smell and taste

162
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,600
and they were reporting rashes and hair

163
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,039
loss

164
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:04,400
uh what was that like uh back in 2014

165
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:07,519
what happened when it all

166
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:10,079
started it was bad like i mean i i can't

167
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:12,719
think of any other term to use it except

168
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:13,918
bad and then again you have people who

169
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,120
have no other

170
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:19,359
ways of getting uh water

171
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,478
or clean clean water because it was

172
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,759
through the whole

173
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:26,800
city through the whole pipes uh

174
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,479
and so it was it put people like

175
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,478
you would have to have lived through it

176
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:33,439
in order to have seen it

177
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:35,120
in order to to know how bad it has has

178
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:37,519
been when you have kids who

179
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,160
can't drink water out of their faucet

180
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:40,399
they can't

181
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,000
bathe with water that's running through

182
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:45,359
the pipes and

183
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,478
we're five years in now and

184
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,680
it still hasn't been cured yet you know

185
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:52,719
like it still hasn't been

186
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:55,840
fixed yet for the city on other holes so

187
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:58,319
it was i it it pains me

188
00:06:55,839 --> 00:07:00,799
to think about you know like some of the

189
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:03,840
the things that i saw like from you from

190
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:07,120
working the slingy new farming project

191
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:10,239
i used to bring water in the jugs

192
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,639
and arizona jugs to feed our plants

193
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,960
in flint because we can't use the water

194
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:17,038
in flint because the water was painted

195
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:19,120
so i used to bring water to feed the

196
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:21,120
plants and then bring water for some of

197
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:24,079
the family kids of our

198
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,160
uh kids that was in our pro program so

199
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:27,120
just imagine that water like you you

200
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,360
would think

201
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,399
clean water is something that everyone

202
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,439
has

203
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:35,198
flint michigan hasn't had it for six

204
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:36,800
years now

205
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,400
yeah i mean it seems like a universal

206
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,079
human right it's something that

207
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:41,918
i've always taken for granted here in

208
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:45,279
the pacific northwest we have

209
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:46,159
really amazing water and i've been very

210
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:48,399
fortunate

211
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,479
and it sounds like from from reading

212
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:51,120
articles on this to refresh my memory

213
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:53,120
that

214
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,199
the water in the river was so caustic it

215
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,918
actually uh stripped the lead

216
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,919
out of the old plumbing systems and

217
00:07:57,918 --> 00:08:01,680
caused very high lead levels

218
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:03,120
which doctors were seeing in the blood

219
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,319
of children you know five

220
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,720
ten times higher than what uh was known

221
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,759
to be

222
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:13,199
safe uh based on the uh

223
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,720
on the levels so so people were being

224
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,720
forced to

225
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,720
shower and use these and then try and

226
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,280
find other things to drink or find clean

227
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,120
water

228
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:22,478
to drink and you know getting back to

229
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,879
your nutrition thing

230
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:26,318
this is speculation on my part but was

231
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,879
there a lot more people than drinking

232
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,560
soda

233
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,240
and arizona teas and a lot of these

234
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:34,719
other really cheap

235
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:37,120
um yet unhealthy uh beverages

236
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,320
oh yes definitely because you have to

237
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,879
find something to

238
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,240
to drink because it's it's very

239
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:44,879
unnatural to

240
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,720
try to go without drinking water you

241
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:48,480
know like from a natural source like you

242
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,200
automatically think you come to the sink

243
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,399
and get it

244
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,680
but in flint you had to learn different

245
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,240
ways of

246
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:58,319
of drinking or of getting water because

247
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,200
clean water wasn't uh

248
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,000
accessible to you and so people pick up

249
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,000
and started

250
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:09,120
drinking cokes or drinking sodas or 99

251
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,720
drinks since they like that was their

252
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,440
water

253
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,040
which i assume contributed to obesity

254
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,480
and diabetes and a lot of these other

255
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:18,559
challenges

256
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,159
so this inspired you to start the flint

257
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:22,239
unity farming project

258
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:24,159
and i don't know how i found out about

259
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,839
you i think it was through instagram

260
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:27,199
i i think you've started following me

261
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:29,440
and then i went and checked it out

262
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,600
and uh you know you're posting a lot of

263
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,680
photos i highly suggest people go

264
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,120
uh you know give them give them a follow

265
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:37,278
and check out the flint unity

266
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,360
farming project can you tell me a little

267
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:41,439
bit about what that project is and how

268
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,240
you got it started

269
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,360
oh yeah definitely uh the flint unity

270
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,399
fireman project

271
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:52,320
is a army inspired youth gardening

272
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:55,600
and uh program as i uh said uh

273
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,879
this was the idea of my dad my dad was

274
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,920
in the service

275
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:02,639
he was in germany back in 65

276
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:04,319
and he was working and he had a vision

277
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:07,199
of a gardening school

278
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,920
and so he wrote some notes down about it

279
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,959
and

280
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:12,799
he came back you know was

281
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:14,559
in the service and then he got out the

282
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:17,919
service and then he became a

283
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:19,838
school teacher and so this garden thing

284
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:21,838
was always something that

285
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,120
he did because we used to garden around

286
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,200
the house like

287
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,679
i couldn't play the atari video game

288
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,200
unless i had logged in three hours of

289
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:31,919
guarding time with him

290
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:34,160
outside so if anyone remember the atari

291
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:36,639
video games the 2600

292
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:38,719
pole position all of that i just

293
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:40,480
couldn't play it until i got tired i

294
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,360
actually had to work

295
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,360
doing out agriculture to earn credits in

296
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,200
order to play the video game because my

297
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,959
dad was just dead set on you need to

298
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,800
know what my life was like

299
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:52,639
growing up so that's where the

300
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:58,078
agriculture came in so

301
00:10:52,639 --> 00:11:01,600
december uh christmas uh december of 201

302
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:04,399
15 my dad we were at mclaren uh

303
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,680
hospital he was in hospital and he said

304
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:07,519
damn do you remember i

305
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:09,599
talked to you about that garden class

306
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:12,240
well i want you to try to start it now

307
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,159
and i don't want you to quit and i want

308
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,600
you to see how hard it's gonna be

309
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:20,879
to set up things and so from

310
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,480
my dad and i talking in the hospital

311
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:24,320
that's how the flint unity farming

312
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,720
project actually uh

313
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,800
started i gave it a name we wrote down

314
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,160
the core things that that we wanted to

315
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:33,039
accomplish with it

316
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:34,000
and it was actually a business uh side

317
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:36,719
to us so

318
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,360
it was big so when we wrote it up it was

319
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,120
actually

320
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,879
for us to get everything that we needed

321
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,720
so far as buying the trucks

322
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:44,399
and getting everything like on a big

323
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,600
scale it was

324
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:49,440
close to 750 000 like the starting in

325
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,240
order to get everything for us to have

326
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,160
it started

327
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,480
we knew no one was going to give us that

328
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:57,199
so what i did was i scaled everything

329
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,800
back uh to where we don't even have a

330
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,440
building but to where we would be able

331
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:03,199
to teach

332
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:06,240
kids and so that's the uh business

333
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,720
model that we moved out on and so

334
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,240
that's how we got us started so today we

335
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,839
have been able to teach

336
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:16,480
upwards over uh over 350 children

337
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,880
free of charge and we're just hoping to

338
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,039
con

339
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:20,879
continue we just need the resources in

340
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:23,199
order to be able to do it

341
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:24,000
because my brother also a military

342
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,519
veteran

343
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,240
army he and i run the pro program

344
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,519
together but i'm the more vocal focused

345
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,759
uh one in it

346
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,720
and he just comes in and work and then

347
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:37,519
leave so

348
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,079
yeah we're that's basically our pro

349
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,799
program

350
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:43,120
of teaching kids how to be able to grow

351
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:44,000
vegetables to help offset their exposure

352
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,560
from the

353
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,559
flint water crisis and then for them to

354
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:50,239
just learn how to be able to eat and be

355
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:51,919
healthy

356
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,278
yeah now when we were talking before you

357
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:56,639
had mentioned how

358
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:58,159
the there was quite an outpouring of

359
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,079
interest in the community when

360
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:01,199
people found out about your program can

361
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:04,559
you tell me about

362
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:06,800
uh sort of what that what that was like

363
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:08,879
um i i know you did some you know you

364
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:09,120
put up some ads and stuff initially for

365
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:11,039
it

366
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,879
but you got a really good turnout you

367
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:14,399
said and then what what did you teach

368
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:14,958
the kids what were some of the focuses

369
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,159
around

370
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:21,119
the program when everyone was showing up

371
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:21,919
well well for our uh gardening pro

372
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,120
program

373
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:27,759
what the basis was to teach kids where

374
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,959
uh plant life what is plant life and

375
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:32,399
then how to

376
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:33,759
grow vegetables so i kept it elementary

377
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,720
so far as

378
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:37,360
how to what vegetables that that we grew

379
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,560
because

380
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,240
uh i taught them how to grow tomatoes

381
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:42,879
and how to grow i'm trying to remember

382
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:47,039
the

383
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:48,000
herbs but i thought chives and something

384
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:50,958
else that was known

385
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,519
to if you eat it it can all offset a

386
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:53,759
lead

387
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,600
in in your your body so i basically

388
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:58,319
taught them how to grow

389
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,720
basic vegetables and then how they could

390
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,000
grow

391
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:05,278
other uh things and so i kept it in a

392
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,440
one like like a abc

393
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:08,720
format and i tried to give them

394
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,839
something to take home

395
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,440
uh the summer class was for eight weeks

396
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:15,600
so i tried to have them with something

397
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,279
that they could take home every week

398
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,800
and keep growing and then they could

399
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:20,879
take pictures for the kids to have

400
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:23,039
phones to let me see them or

401
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:25,278
and so that was basically my teaching uh

402
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:26,559
method was just teaching kids the basics

403
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:29,759
of how to

404
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:33,439
uh in npk level like i teach them

405
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:34,639
in npk and i tell them like a simple way

406
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,680
of knowing what that means

407
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:40,079
is up down and all around so

408
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:40,799
so i'm basically teaching them uh

409
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:42,958
gardening

410
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:44,078
but just doing it in such a way to where

411
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:46,638
they can understand

412
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:48,399
what they are doing yeah and you

413
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,159
mentioned that a lot of the kids

414
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,759
are were setting up gardens at their

415
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:55,120
house or even in the

416
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:57,679
abandoned lots or houses oh yes yes

417
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,278
yes it's a lot of uh abandoned houses

418
00:14:57,679 --> 00:14:59,679
around so a lot of the plants that i

419
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:01,919
gave

420
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:02,958
kids they took them home and planted it

421
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:06,240
either on their

422
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:09,278
uh yard in their backyard or it's

423
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,440
hundreds of vacant uh homes like there's

424
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:12,879
a house then there's five vacant homes

425
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,560
and then there's a house so

426
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:17,120
they could easily go and plant a

427
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:19,278
vegetable in a vacant lot

428
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,839
and let it grow and that was another

429
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:23,919
part of our program was to beautify the

430
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,120
city of flint but of course that fell on

431
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:27,439
deaf ears

432
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,879
no no one was really concerned about

433
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,959
beautifying flint

434
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:33,360
but that was another thing that we

435
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:35,838
wanted to gear the kids up to where

436
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,560
to not only feel good about yourself but

437
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,800
feel good

438
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:40,638
about the community which you are from

439
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:43,838
and do things to better it

440
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:45,839
you know and you had mentioned that

441
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,920
uh a lot of the kids didn't know about

442
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:52,000
vegetables

443
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:54,240
oh yes yeah oh yeah

444
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,078
i mean and it's just funny because if

445
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,600
you don't know if you're not exposed to

446
00:15:56,078 --> 00:16:01,439
it you don't don't know

447
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:03,040
uh i was at uh the amazing grace church

448
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,199
i was speaking at a church

449
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:07,198
and i just happened to ask the kids uh

450
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:07,838
where the vegetables come from and they

451
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:10,399
said

452
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:11,360
not even trying to be funny walmart it

453
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,078
comes from

454
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,720
walmart it comes from myers and i'm like

455
00:16:14,078 --> 00:16:17,919
no

456
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,399
it where where does it come from and

457
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:20,240
they

458
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,078
stuck at the store not even

459
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:25,360
understanding that

460
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:26,879
green vegetables green uh peppers come

461
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,720
from the ground that you can grow on

462
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:30,078
from the ground they didn't even make

463
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,120
that connection

464
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:35,519
and so it's good that our program was

465
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,078
able to help kids make that connection

466
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,360
that

467
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:40,638
you can grow your own food like it's

468
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,320
something that they don't even

469
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,639
think think man about you know and

470
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:47,199
living in this computer age

471
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,560
everyone is basically thinking in the

472
00:16:47,198 --> 00:16:50,958
com computer mind

473
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:52,159
mind frame as opposed to what they can

474
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:54,319
actually do

475
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:55,519
for them themselves you know and it just

476
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,199
takes hard work

477
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,799
to to do it that's the other thing

478
00:16:57,198 --> 00:17:02,078
gardening is not easy

479
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:04,318
it's a delayed satisfaction thing but if

480
00:17:02,078 --> 00:17:06,639
you can learn how to space it out

481
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:08,240
and do it then you will be better off

482
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,559
and once you learn how to do it

483
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,000
then you will always be able to to do it

484
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:15,199
so you could always provide

485
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,640
food if you put in the word

486
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,839
yeah what are your goals for the future

487
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:23,439
with the flint unity farming project

488
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:24,558
oh the the goals is vast for what it is

489
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:27,919
that i want uh

490
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:28,720
to to do we want to basically get our

491
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:32,240
program

492
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:35,440
uh sponsored or partnered with the

493
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:39,919
nfl uh the nba

494
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:42,480
and uh mbbl with the base

495
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:44,880
base baseball we would want to have

496
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,440
flint unique farming projects in

497
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,320
every city possible and you and i spoke

498
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,440
about before

499
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:54,319
i had a friend that was out in seattle

500
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,120
and we were supposed to try to get one

501
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:56,720
set up in

502
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:59,279
seattle when he was there but he got

503
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:02,079
traded uh traded to another team

504
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:02,639
so we weren't able to get that set up

505
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:05,199
but

506
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,960

to grow has been the uh pale

547
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:35,679

for them yeah that's great yeah

576
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,440
in our family uh my my father always

577
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:34,319
plants a garden that's way too large for

578
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,919
us because

579
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:38,000
it's his favorite thing to go out in the

580
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:40,240
community and share with neighbors

581
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,759
fresh vegetables right that's that's his

582
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,599
way of connecting with people and his

583
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:45,440
way of sort of giving back

584
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:47,199
um and it gives him a lot of a lot of

585
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:50,640
joy

586
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:52,880
yeah and that and that's our thing

587
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,240
at the the three years that we've been

588
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,720
able to run our pro

589
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,240
program the vegetables that we grow i

590
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,079
give them to the kids and to the

591
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,798
families of the kids that's in our

592
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:04,158
pro program and then any of the other

593
00:21:02,798 --> 00:21:06,558
ones i normally

594
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:08,080
give them away to people or sell sell

595
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:08,720
them to people in order for us to be

596
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:11,359
able to have

597
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,159
resources to do something else but yeah

598
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:14,158
the

599
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,200
giving of the community knowing that

600
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:18,159
you're

601
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:20,159
helping someone giving someone substance

602
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:23,120
giving you know food like

603
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:24,320
there's not any thing to to me i think

604
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:26,558
that's better

605
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:27,678
you know then doing that for someone

606
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:29,918
especially in this

607
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,280
you know today's climate and time you

608
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:34,400
know it it shows

609
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:36,399
it's giving compassion to humans and and

610
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,519
it almost seemed like that's like a lost

611
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,720
part of actually

612
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:42,480
caring about someone like now it's

613
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,000
you just hit like on something and then

614
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,400
that's justification

615
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,558
or that's uh oh well i i haven't done

616
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,400
enough i didn't hit like up on your post

617
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:53,359
but it's actually you're doing something

618
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,400
to help a another person i i think it's

619
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:57,119
life changing

620
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,600
