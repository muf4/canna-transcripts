00:00:59,698 --> 00:01:02,878
mats if you hadn't had a chance yet

25
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,799
please go back and listen to the

26
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:07,019
previous podcast with Steve Troy to get

27
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,790
a bit of background blue mats use no

28
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:10,618
electricity and are an affordable way to

29
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:13,500
improve the way you water your plants in

30
00:01:10,618 --> 00:01:15,599
this podcast I go into depth with Damien

31
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,790
one of the employees over at blue mats

32
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:19,649
on exactly how to set them up properly

33
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:21,689
as well as tackle the common user

34
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:24,150
questions and feedback I got after the

35
00:01:21,688 --> 00:01:27,929

heard about them on our podcast and now

43
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:44,549
on to the show all right thanks Damien I

44
00:01:43,349 --> 00:01:46,408
appreciate you taking the time today to

45
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:50,130
chat a little bit more about blue mats

46
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:51,560
and do a follow up follow up podcast ya

47
00:01:50,129 --> 00:01:54,269
know it sounds great to me

48
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:56,280
so I wanted to just dive right in here

49
00:01:54,269 --> 00:01:59,609
since we covered a lot in the last

50
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,049
podcast and talked about dialing in the

51
00:01:59,609 --> 00:02:02,509
blue mats since we've already covered

52
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:05,100
kind of what they are and what they do

53
00:02:02,509 --> 00:02:07,590
can you give me a little overview here

54
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:09,750
starting with we talked a little about

55
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:11,819
soaking the blue mats to get all the air

56
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,599
out of the carrot can we just go from

57
00:02:11,818 --> 00:02:14,659
there and

58
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:17,340
forward with how you prep them

59
00:02:14,659 --> 00:02:18,900
definitely definitely um so yeah it's

60
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:21,780
kind of changed a little bit over the

61
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:23,879
years in terms of kind of priming and

62
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:26,640
prepping those blue mats originally

63
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:29,490
Austria kind of wanted us to do it for I

64
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:30,929
think 12 hours underwater but in the

65
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:32,850
last few years just running more tests

66
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:34,950
and everything we just realized that you

67
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:37,139
want to just soak that ceramic cone

68
00:02:34,949 --> 00:02:39,649
until it's basically just porous enough

69
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:43,409
where water is both in and outside of it

70
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:45,480
and so now it's just 15 minutes without

71
00:02:43,409 --> 00:02:48,000
the cap on and the cap is that little

72
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:50,639
green top I go they screw on the blue

73
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,349
minute and so you want to do it just 15

74
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:54,959
minutes underwater without the cap and

75
00:02:52,349 --> 00:02:56,699
then while it's in your bucket or bowl

76
00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:00,150
of water or whatever it might be then

77
00:02:56,699 --> 00:03:02,009
you just screwed that back on just so

78
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:04,230
that for another 15 minutes and it's

79
00:03:02,009 --> 00:03:06,929
really just because the way that a blue

80
00:03:04,229 --> 00:03:08,789
mat is working is it's constantly

81
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:10,800
reading kind of the pressure and within

82
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:13,169
the blue mat and so as long as you get

83
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:16,230
that that ceramic cone to just be porous

84
00:03:13,169 --> 00:03:17,939
enough with water then you're pretty

85
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:20,879
good so that's why 15 minutes without

86
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:24,270
the cap 50 minutes with and you want to

87
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:27,389
make sure that yeah you don't get as few

88
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:30,420
air bubbles within the blue mat oh and

89
00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:32,639
that can be we I know the really like

90
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:34,169
kind of master way to do it is using a

91
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:37,019
little pipette to kind of squeeze water

92
00:03:34,169 --> 00:03:38,729
within it me personally I just use my

93
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:41,820
thumb to kind of push water within I

94
00:03:38,729 --> 00:03:44,369
know people use an eyedropper to it's it

95
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:46,289
really kind of comes down to it and it's

96
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:48,240
not 100% necessary even if there's a few

97
00:03:46,289 --> 00:03:50,280
bubbles it's not going to kind of ruin

98
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,469
the function of the blue mat it's just

99
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,449
we believe without with zero bubbles in

100
00:03:52,469 --> 00:03:56,400
there you kind of get the best accuracy

101
00:03:54,449 --> 00:03:58,250
of the blue mat meaning the blue mats

102
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,629
going to react and respond better to

103
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:03,389
kind of those outside factors it will

104
00:04:00,629 --> 00:04:06,539
know when the pressure outside of it

105
00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:09,299
meaning if the the soil around the blue

106
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:11,340
mat gets a little drier then it'll be

107
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:13,140
able to read that quicker and start

108
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:16,620
dripping water and get it back to that

109
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:18,089
kind of prime watering zone one thing

110
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:20,879
that's always really important I always

111
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:23,609
tell people is you want to make sure

112
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:25,469
that you're not putting in the blue mat

113
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:26,310
when the soil is either too wet or too

114
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:28,440
dry

115
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:30,480
because that's your basically setting

116
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:33,060
the bloom at that whole default setting

117
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:36,240
of turning it to little triangles um

118
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:38,819
followed there and instructions all of

119
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,069
that is when the moisture level is at

120
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:44,250
it's kind of prime point at its best

121
00:04:41,069 --> 00:04:45,990
moisture level so if you said it when it

122
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:48,329
stood ride the blue Matt's gonna kind of

123
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:50,100
keep it at that dry level so what I like

124
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:52,500
to tell people is just either overnight

125
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:54,480
or a few hours before and water how

126
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,399
you'd normally do so that there's enough

127
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:59,640
water throughout the entire container

128
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:02,039
not just on the top versus the bottom

129
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:04,439
and that's a really important factor is

130
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:06,480
making sure you're priming that blue mat

131
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:07,529
into that ideal moisture level because

132
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:11,610
that's what the bloom that's going to

133
00:05:07,529 --> 00:05:13,949
kind of do yeah with our soils I found

134
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:16,050
we like I like people to water the soil

135
00:05:13,949 --> 00:05:18,329
really slowly because there is peat moss

136
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:21,389
in there and it can get hydrophobic yep

137
00:05:18,329 --> 00:05:23,069
so it's a matter of watering a little

138
00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:24,959
bit of water at a time so it's over a

139
00:05:23,069 --> 00:05:27,089
period of a few hours to get that

140
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:28,918
moisture content to the optimal levels

141
00:05:27,089 --> 00:05:30,269
which in our soils again we aim for a

142
00:05:28,918 --> 00:05:31,949
hundred mbar but it's gonna vary

143
00:05:30,269 --> 00:05:34,918
depending on the soil that you're using

144
00:05:31,949 --> 00:05:37,409
and once you have your soil at that

145
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:39,060
level which those moisture meters the

146
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:40,620
digital moisture meters are excellent

147
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:42,240
for telling you when you're at that then

148
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:45,000
you can start looking to actually set up

149
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,780
and dial in your blue mats exactly

150
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,610
exactly

151
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:50,369
one other thing I'll point out and maybe

152
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:52,740
you can correct me on this is when I was

153
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:55,319
talking to Steve originally he was

154
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:57,478
saying that you want to attach the blue

155
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:59,728
mat to like screw it back together under

156
00:05:57,478 --> 00:06:02,788
water and kind of knock the two pieces

157
00:05:59,728 --> 00:06:06,509
to get any bubbles out you'd mentioned

158
00:06:02,788 --> 00:06:08,639
using a pipette how would you use the

159
00:06:06,509 --> 00:06:11,370
pipette I wasn't familiar with that in

160
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:14,279
the process yeah so the pipe exactly is

161
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:16,860
just essentially underneath the in the

162
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:19,049
blue mat so under when you have it under

163
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,740
water and I mean even if you have it

164
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:21,960
above water

165
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:24,389
if you unscrew it and look at the little

166
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:27,180
cap there's these three small looking

167
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:29,519
little ovals almost on the other side of

168
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:33,660
the cap and what tends to happen is

169
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:35,310
water will sometimes not get into those

170
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,990
parts meaning there's basically an air

171
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:38,908
bubble underneath these three little

172
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:39,990
holes that I found on the cap of the

173
00:06:38,908 --> 00:06:41,699
Bluma

174
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:44,040
and so the thing you do with the pipette

175
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:46,740
is essentially just squeeze water into

176
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:49,290
those three parts basically pushing any

177
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:52,610
air bubbles away and out of the bloom at

178
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:54,689
the other way you kind of described as

179
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:56,910
alternative where you kind of shake any

180
00:06:54,689 --> 00:06:58,939
bubbles out or what I mentioned is

181
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:02,400
basically pushing water with your thumb

182
00:06:58,939 --> 00:07:04,319
inside the doing the same function as

183
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:07,769
the pipette the pipette just kind of

184
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:09,480
really lets you know for sure that you

185
00:07:07,769 --> 00:07:11,250
push water into there and that there's

186
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,750
not going to be any air bubbles so it's

187
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:15,329
not a hundred percent necessary but for

188
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:16,860
kind of ten cents it might not be a bad

189
00:07:15,329 --> 00:07:19,949
idea or if you just have some pipettes

190
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:21,810
laying around now I've been going down

191
00:07:19,949 --> 00:07:25,050
to the store and getting distilled water

192
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:27,540
for soaking my blue mats to make sure

193
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:28,889
that there's no other you know particles

194
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:31,939
or anything else that could be in my

195
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:35,939
water is that overkill or even necessary

196
00:07:31,939 --> 00:07:37,860
I'd say it's not I mean you could say it

197
00:07:35,939 --> 00:07:39,420
is overkill I know people that do it

198
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:42,120
similar to what you're doing

199
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:43,680
the alternative is honestly just boiling

200
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,660
water because that's going to do the

201
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,519
same thing the great thing with

202
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:49,410
distilled water is you know there isn't

203
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:51,870
anything there's no sediments in there

204
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:56,280
you know that any of the kind of oxygen

205
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:57,959
has already been there's no there's not

206
00:07:56,279 --> 00:08:00,299
gonna be any oxygen bubbles within this

207
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:03,000
distilled water because sometimes if you

208
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:04,560
just pour water directly from your sink

209
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,980
or anything then there is gonna be a lot

210
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,629
of air bubbles in that water so I would

211
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:12,090
say yeah it might be a little overkill

212
00:08:09,629 --> 00:08:15,240
just because you're paying for more for

213
00:08:12,089 --> 00:08:16,769
just clean water but if you have

214
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:19,110
distilled water around or anything like

215
00:08:16,769 --> 00:08:21,139
that then you certainly can use that for

216
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:23,610
as an alternative to just boiling water

217
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:25,019
okay so now we've taken the two pieces

218
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:26,490
of the blue mat we've connected them

219
00:08:25,019 --> 00:08:28,529
under water we've made sure there's no

220
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:31,650
air bubbles what's the next step in the

221
00:08:28,529 --> 00:08:33,990
process for setting them up alright so

222
00:08:31,649 --> 00:08:35,939
the next step is once we have your blue

223
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:37,830
mat primed with water and it's already

224
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:39,300
porous throughout the whole thing next

225
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:40,680
thing would be getting your soil right

226
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:43,799
so kind of what you're mentioning before

227
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:46,469
slow watering soil just to allow that

228
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:48,419
water to within the soil to really kind

229
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:51,210
of just paying move around to all the

230
00:08:48,419 --> 00:08:53,579
places and needs to be I know your soil

231
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:56,400
is pretty amazing to use with blue mats

232
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:59,490
but blue mats can work with kind of

233
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:01,259
different types of soils it just may

234
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:03,419
have to kind of be adjusted differently

235
00:09:01,259 --> 00:09:05,460
or you might have to a kind of account

236
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:07,409
for if a soil is really good at

237
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:10,889
spreading that moisture versus retaining

238
00:09:07,409 --> 00:09:12,990
it then you might want to kind of just

239
00:09:10,889 --> 00:09:14,970
prime the bloom at a little different

240
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:16,769
and when I mean prime I mean there's a

241
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:20,129
step the next step would be putting it

242
00:09:16,769 --> 00:09:22,500
into the soil and then turning you

243
00:09:20,129 --> 00:09:24,000
essentially open up the bloom at so

244
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,129
waters flowing you connect it to your

245
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,799
water source so that water is actually

246
00:09:26,129 --> 00:09:30,899
going through the bloom at and so on the

247
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:33,539
top of the bloom at there's these what I

248
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:35,730
call low brown cap and that little cap

249
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:37,500
actually if you look into it has these

250
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:40,379
little knot into it on the outside

251
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:42,120
there's these little triangles and

252
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:44,490
that's what you're kind of using it to

253
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:46,590
control your bloom at so the basic

254
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:50,370
instructions set up instructions in the

255
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:52,649
manual is essentially you open up the

256
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:55,440
carrot so that water is flowing out and

257
00:09:52,649 --> 00:09:57,959
then you slowly close it until what we

258
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,610
call there's a hanging drop and that

259
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:02,580
essentially means that water is just on

260
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:05,879
the edge of that small three millimeter

261
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:07,710
drip tubing so water's found out that on

262
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:09,509
the very edge there and it's not falling

263
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:12,360
and it's not going back in it's just

264
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:14,220
kind of standing there and then you

265
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:17,120
close the bloom at and other two

266
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:20,700
triangles which is about a quarter of

267
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:24,120
the full radius of the brown cap and

268
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:27,780
that two carrot are the two triangles

269
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:29,730
that's essentially allowing it so the

270
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:33,539
blue mat is going to stay closed until

271
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:36,810
the soil dries up enough and then it's

272
00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:38,519
going to open up the blue mat and it's

273
00:10:36,809 --> 00:10:42,779
going to allow water to kind of feed

274
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:45,600
into the soil and that's where you kind

275
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:47,789
of have some leeway is those changing

276
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,430
those different triangles either opening

277
00:10:47,789 --> 00:10:53,370
it or closing it more so generally for

278
00:10:50,429 --> 00:10:55,739
no tilt kind of grow where you want more

279
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:58,289
more moisture you don't have to close at

280
00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:00,509
the full two triangles you can do one

281
00:10:58,289 --> 00:11:01,889
triangle or even one a half and it just

282
00:11:00,509 --> 00:11:03,840
means that the bloom that's going to be

283
00:11:01,889 --> 00:11:06,600
a little more responsive in terms of its

284
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:07,050
going to start watering sooner so the

285
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,820
more you

286
00:11:07,049 --> 00:11:12,059
close it the less its going to water

287
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:14,430
frequently and the more open you leave

288
00:11:12,059 --> 00:11:17,369
those triangles the more waters can be

289
00:11:14,429 --> 00:11:19,559
entered so the default way of setting it

290
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:21,149
is after you so you take let's say your

291
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:24,059
blue mats are still in your bucket of

292
00:11:21,149 --> 00:11:25,799
water and then your soil is that the

293
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:29,849
ideal moisture level you wanted to kind

294
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:32,250
of retain or stay and and so you take

295
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:34,290
that blue mat you put it into the soil

296
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:39,089
you connect it into the eight millimeter

297
00:11:34,289 --> 00:11:40,860
tubing and then you open up the blue mat

298
00:11:39,089 --> 00:11:43,290
to make sure water is flowing out and

299
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:45,240
then you close it with the little brown

300
00:11:43,289 --> 00:11:47,338
cap until there's what we call the

301
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:49,470
hanging drip so waters just found at the

302
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:53,250
tip of the tubing the three millimeter

303
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:54,509
tubing and then you close it another two

304
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:57,870
triangles which is about quarter

305
00:11:54,509 --> 00:11:59,458
rotation of the brown cap and you leave

306
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:01,139
it there that's it and if you want you

307
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:02,578
can connect distribution drippers to it

308
00:12:01,139 --> 00:12:05,179
or you can just allow it to come off

309
00:12:02,578 --> 00:12:08,578
that three millimeter tubing directly

310
00:12:05,179 --> 00:12:09,809
yeah so I found what works best for us

311
00:12:08,578 --> 00:12:11,699
and I think that's an important point

312
00:12:09,809 --> 00:12:13,708
you brought up I was attaching the

313
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:15,778
distribution drippers or the blue so

314
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:17,699
tape prior to dialing in my blue mat

315
00:12:15,778 --> 00:12:20,850
which is a mistake you want to just keep

316
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:22,259
that three millimeter line empty and not

317
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:24,839
attach anything until you do that

318
00:12:22,259 --> 00:12:27,208
hanging drop step and then correct I

319
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:29,550
found going back one carat it works

320
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:30,899
pretty well with our soils like you

321
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:34,500
mentioned living soils you want to be a

322
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:37,828
little bit wetter do you have a optimal

323
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:41,429
or general level for people say using

324
00:12:37,828 --> 00:12:43,769
cocoa or out in traditional garden or an

325
00:12:41,429 --> 00:12:46,139
outdoor setup that you might offer them

326
00:12:43,769 --> 00:12:47,669
as a guideline you know similar to the

327
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:51,778
hundred M bar that I really like with

328
00:12:47,669 --> 00:12:53,669
our soils yeah so I found especially

329
00:12:51,778 --> 00:12:55,769
using our digital moisture meters are

330
00:12:53,669 --> 00:12:57,689
really going to kind of allow you to get

331
00:12:55,769 --> 00:12:59,490
that perfect point and I know we've

332
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:01,740
talked about this before times we're

333
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:04,019
kind of cussing different types of

334
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:06,000
moisture meters and if you're a really

335
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:08,539
expert grower and you've been growing

336
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,940
for years and you really know kind of a

337
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:13,889
type of moisture level you want your

338
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:16,470
soil I know people who can easily just

339
00:13:13,889 --> 00:13:18,470
grab a handful of their soil and then

340
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:20,399
determine that's the perfect level

341
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:21,990
someone like me

342
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,819
or others who just want to have an

343
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:26,190
actual digital reading of it to really

344
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:28,290
make sure then our digital moisture

345
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:30,510
meters work really well for that because

346
00:13:28,289 --> 00:13:32,759
I've looked and this is what we talked

347
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:35,610
about prior is we looked on moist other

348
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:37,889
moisture meters found on like Amazon or

349
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:39,779
just on Google and we bought them and

350
00:13:37,889 --> 00:13:42,600
tried them out ourselves and they work

351
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:45,389
fine for just being able to determine if

352
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:47,310
it's too wet or too dry but what you're

353
00:13:45,389 --> 00:13:49,529
kind of asking is finding that optimal

354
00:13:47,309 --> 00:13:52,529
moisture level so with our digital

355
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:55,079
moisture meters usually the range that

356
00:13:52,529 --> 00:13:58,709
I'm telling people is between 120 and

357
00:13:55,080 --> 00:14:01,830
150 so around 130 works really well

358
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:05,970
especially with with a cocoa blend or

359
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:09,030
even just regular just peat moss types

360
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:10,950
of grow the main thing when you're

361
00:14:09,029 --> 00:14:12,990
setting or bloom that up is you want to

362
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:15,120
make sure you're kind of putting it on a

363
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:18,899
zone where it's not gonna give you a

364
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,639
incorrect reading so by saying this I

365
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:23,669
mean don't put it next to these huge

366
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:25,559
perlite chunks or you know in the very

367
00:14:23,669 --> 00:14:28,379
corner of your pot where it's gonna

368
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:30,389
obviously sense the moisture of the

369
00:14:28,379 --> 00:14:31,200
actual fabric pot or the clay pot

370
00:14:30,389 --> 00:14:32,939
whatever it might be

371
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,830
you want to put it in a zone where

372
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:37,710
there's plenty of soil to surround it

373
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:40,500
and kind of what I'm saying not where

374
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:42,840
there's a really high ratio of perlite

375
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:46,200
or just other stuff that might affect it

376
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:47,940
and Coco since Coco I know log growers

377
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:51,930
are using mix of coke or even just pure

378
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:54,180
cocoa it retains moisture really well so

379
00:14:51,929 --> 00:14:57,659
you could almost go a little higher up

380
00:14:54,179 --> 00:15:00,809
to 150 or even 180 if you if your

381
00:14:57,659 --> 00:15:02,939
flowers are or if your yeah your plants

382
00:15:00,809 --> 00:15:06,479
are flowering where it's using even less

383
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:09,480
water so I'd say the 150 range is great

384
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:12,060
if you tend to like your plants having

385
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:15,000
more water or soil requires more water

386
00:15:12,059 --> 00:15:17,129
like a living so low no-till grow then

387
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,809
that 100 works really well so I would

388
00:15:17,129 --> 00:15:21,350
agree with you on that point that 100

389
00:15:18,809 --> 00:15:23,759
works great for your your style of grew

390
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:27,210
so a couple things I want to highlight

391
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:30,179
that from what you mentioned so

392
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:31,889
initially we're going from a water

393
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:33,750
source just backing up a little bit here

394
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:36,840
and yeah if we're

395
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:40,279
using a Mainliner or plumbed line we

396
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:42,450
will need to add in a pressure reducer

397
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:44,759
right at the beginning there and then

398
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:47,850
you can run splitters off of that to set

399
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:49,230
up the rest of your your line but that 8

400
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:51,450
millimeter line which is what would come

401
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:53,430
off of the pressure reducer or if you're

402
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:55,710
using a reservoir with a with a bulkhead

403
00:15:53,429 --> 00:15:58,109
connector you can do it that way too

404
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:59,970
then you go from there down to your

405
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:03,360
carrot and then you can sort of create

406
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:06,660
your garden setup based off of based off

407
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,279
of that one other thing I wanted to

408
00:16:06,659 --> 00:16:11,610
mention when we were setting up I

409
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:13,230
noticed that sometimes I would do all of

410
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:14,610
those steps turn on the water and then

411
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:16,789
nothing would come out of blue mat even

412
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:19,080
though I've opened up that top dial and

413
00:16:16,789 --> 00:16:21,240
something John told me I didn't realize

414
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:23,160
was there can be a little kink in there

415
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:25,500
so you have to take it and just slide

416
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:27,480
the 3 millimetre line out a little bit

417
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,769
and you'll see it's just kind of stuck

418
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,450
together and you can just pinch it

419
00:16:28,769 --> 00:16:32,939
lightly with your fingers and it'll come

420
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:35,520
undone and then water will start flowing

421
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:37,230
and then you can dial correct yeah and

422
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,639
we have people that will call us with

423
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:41,279
exactly that they're saying hey I

424
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,960
connected to Mike water source I opened

425
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:45,049
up the carrot fully meaning with the

426
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:48,180
little brown cap you basically turn it

427
00:16:45,049 --> 00:16:51,269
counterclockwise so you opening you open

428
00:16:48,179 --> 00:16:53,279
it up fully and at that point water

429
00:16:51,269 --> 00:16:56,399
definitely should be coming out so my

430
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:58,740
basic steps which it's kind of funny

431
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:01,319
sometimes people don't realize that like

432
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:03,629
the shut-off valve near their reservoir

433
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:05,220
they had it closed so one thing is make

434
00:17:03,629 --> 00:17:07,588
sure that that's open so water is

435
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:09,209
flowing throughout the other thing is

436
00:17:07,588 --> 00:17:11,698
people don't realize in a gravity system

437
00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:14,310
that it actually has the water reservoir

438
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:16,560
the water container has to be above the

439
00:17:14,309 --> 00:17:18,568
plant so I've had it happen where Sohn

440
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:20,188
had at the same level they opened it up

441
00:17:18,568 --> 00:17:21,990
and no water was coming out I was like

442
00:17:20,189 --> 00:17:24,240
raise the reservoir another foot and

443
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:26,549
once they did water started flowing and

444
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,959
then kind of what you talked about which

445
00:17:26,549 --> 00:17:30,149
this rarely happens with the 8

446
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:32,190
millimeter I know with our super flex

447
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:34,170
tubing which is just a highly flexible

448
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:36,779
tubing compared to the a millimeter

449
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:38,519
block that can sometimes kink in terms

450
00:17:36,779 --> 00:17:40,740
of if it gets stuck together it

451
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:43,410
basically it's just it's kind of like

452
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:45,960
something's stepping on it and yeah you

453
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:47,580
just want to kind of pinch it the

454
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,500
opposite way so it opens up

455
00:17:47,579 --> 00:17:52,679
same with a three millimeter that I've

456
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:54,420
seen that happened more more often so

457
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:56,730
pretty rare but sometimes that can get

458
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:59,160
stuck to each other and kind of what you

459
00:17:56,730 --> 00:18:01,559
said you just need to pop it open and

460
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:03,090
then as long as you see as long as you

461
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:05,789
open up your carrots and see waters

462
00:18:03,089 --> 00:18:07,529
going out is flowing out and add a

463
00:18:05,789 --> 00:18:10,019
consistent rate because sometimes you

464
00:18:07,529 --> 00:18:11,700
get air bubbles in your line so you want

465
00:18:10,019 --> 00:18:13,379
to kind of purge those out so once you

466
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,759
see just a regular flow of water coming

467
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:16,920
out then you're good to go and you're

468
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:19,799
ready to proceed with setting it up and

469
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:21,090
everything okay so we just attached our

470
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:22,619
carrot we just checked we have water

471
00:18:21,089 --> 00:18:24,569
flowing out we've dialed in that blue

472
00:18:22,619 --> 00:18:28,079
mat now so that we have a hanging drop

473
00:18:24,569 --> 00:18:31,139
now we have the opportunity to attach up

474
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:34,169
to five distribution drippers or yeah

475
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:36,480
the blue soak hose and there's an

476
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:37,830
adapter for that blue soak and we say

477
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,759
blue soak what we're talking about is

478
00:18:37,829 --> 00:18:45,359
essentially a soaker hose sort of

479
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:46,470
material as yes yes paper and plastic

480
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:49,740
material I don't know how you would

481
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:52,789
describe it yeah I definitely feel like

482
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:55,500
it's a little more plastic moment and

483
00:18:52,789 --> 00:18:56,789
essentially there's plenty of drip tapes

484
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:59,039
out there that's what you call it either

485
00:18:56,789 --> 00:19:01,680
soaker hose or drip tape those are the

486
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:04,139
two words for it which essentially is a

487
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:06,509
type of tape that has these holes

488
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:09,390
throughout the entire thing and it

489
00:19:06,509 --> 00:19:13,319
allows you to essentially distribute

490
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:15,900
more water using a soaker hose than just

491
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:17,879
individual drip points so the difference

492
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:20,340
is distribution drippers are essentially

493
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:23,190
just one spot where water can drip out

494
00:19:20,339 --> 00:19:26,609
and the great thing with attaching those

495
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:29,730
to a carrot is you can just have one

496
00:19:26,609 --> 00:19:32,729
sensor so one area where water is being

497
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:35,549
sensed and have multiple drip points off

498
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:39,630
of that so that allows you to even get

499
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:41,579
up to a 10 gallon pot like a fabric pot

500
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:43,320
it allows you to have even just one

501
00:19:41,579 --> 00:19:45,359
sensor with multiple distribution

502
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:49,200
drippers so that you can really water

503
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:50,849
the entire surface of that pot and then

504
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:54,000
our soaker hose like what you said we

505
00:19:50,849 --> 00:19:57,689
call blue soaked blue so drip tape that

506
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:01,140
you can attach to the carrot or what has

507
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:04,110
been just happening for 25 years over

508
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:06,690
we have a farm in Cuba using that's the

509
00:20:04,109 --> 00:20:09,299
same drip tape that they've been using

510
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:11,070
for 30 years which is the same thing and

511
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:13,109
they don't even have it attached to the

512
00:20:11,069 --> 00:20:15,329
sensor and said it just comes off of a

513
00:20:13,109 --> 00:20:18,329
hose and it just waters a certain amount

514
00:20:15,329 --> 00:20:21,389
of water and there's a big difference

515
00:20:18,329 --> 00:20:24,089
between our soaker hose and conventional

516
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:26,790
soaker hose or drip tape

517
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:30,809
the difference is other drip tapes tend

518
00:20:26,789 --> 00:20:34,799
to only water every 7 inches I feel like

519
00:20:30,809 --> 00:20:37,799
or even every 12 inches while ours is

520
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:39,210
the entire thing actually has thousands

521
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:40,919
of micro tiny holes throughout the

522
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:43,769
entire thing so the whole thing

523
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:45,840
dispenses water not just certain parts

524
00:20:43,769 --> 00:20:48,029
of the drip tape so that's one big

525
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:51,059
difference the other is our tape is

526
00:20:48,029 --> 00:20:53,549
reusable compared to a lot of other drip

527
00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:55,319
tapes that people use they have to

528
00:20:53,549 --> 00:20:58,079
actually throw them out every year and

529
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:59,369
it's a huge waste it's terrible for the

530
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:01,500
environment cuz a lot of times these

531
00:20:59,369 --> 00:21:03,419
these farmers are just taking the tape

532
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:06,900
into the ground they're just tilling

533
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:08,789
over it while ours you just bury it

534
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:10,769
underground under the soil and you can

535
00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:12,960
leave it out during winter and you can

536
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:15,000
reuse it for years and years and like I

537
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,980
said we have a farm in Cuba that's been

538
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,220
using the same one for 25 years and with

539
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:22,620
Puerto Rico and Brazil as well it's very

540
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:24,930
kind of a famed drip tape in our

541
00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:27,000
community and what we managed to do

542
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:30,900
which Austria and Germany all the other

543
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,970
bloom at kind of mega countries the what

544
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:35,750
we managed to achieve is we've combined

545
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:39,120
bloom at carats to this blue soak and

546
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:43,470
you can basically water a lot larger

547
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:46,259
fabric that our fabric pots so 100 150

548
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:48,630
gallon pots are bigger with that using

549
00:21:46,259 --> 00:21:51,150
only one or two sensors and same thing

550
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:54,450
with just Lara like large row crops or

551
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:56,340
anything like that so now we've managed

552
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:58,890
to get greenhouses using blue mat

553
00:21:56,339 --> 00:22:02,269
sensors just attached to the soaker hose

554
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:05,250
and you just lay it out to the crops and

555
00:22:02,269 --> 00:22:07,589
that one sensor or the two sensors you

556
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:10,349
can touch once the beginning or another

557
00:22:07,589 --> 00:22:13,769
to the end and it allows you to just

558
00:22:10,349 --> 00:22:14,699
water these much longer rows of crops

559
00:22:13,769 --> 00:22:16,349
using

560
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:19,470
one sensor that I will still turn off

561
00:22:16,349 --> 00:22:21,089
and on based off the moisture around it

562
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:24,329
I think that's what you're kind of

563
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:27,149
talking about yeah in fact actually I'm

564
00:22:24,329 --> 00:22:28,859
going to be posting a video of the setup

565
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:32,310
on in my greenhouse that we're currently

566
00:22:28,859 --> 00:22:37,109
in the middle of right now and it's an

567
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:39,539
84 by 30 foot greenhouse and I will post

568
00:22:37,109 --> 00:22:41,490
some photos and more information it's

569
00:22:39,539 --> 00:22:43,559
gonna it gonna cost me about a thousand

570
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:45,750
dollars I think all said and done to

571
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:48,179
irrigate set up the blue mats throughout

572
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:50,039
the entire greenhouse and I mean they I

573
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:51,779
know I'm gonna get that back in the cost

574
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:53,339
of labor and watering throughout the

575
00:22:51,779 --> 00:22:56,279
season plus I'll have it for years to

576
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:57,659
come so I think it's well worth using in

577
00:22:56,279 --> 00:23:00,180
these situations and I don't have to

578
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:02,310
worry about my staff remembering to

579
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:04,230
water the plants too so they did get to

580
00:23:02,309 --> 00:23:05,970
dry and it's a lot of work and I've I've

581
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:07,710
actually changed the design again since

582
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:10,799
the last time we talked I know we tried

583
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:12,720
a few different ones out but I've when I

584
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:14,639
went to actually set it up I realized I

585
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:18,000
I think I have a better way of doing it

586
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:20,490
for my particular situation so I'll send

587
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,230
you some photos Oh perfect yeah I'd love

588
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:24,630
to see that this was the one we designed

589
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:27,120
like a month ago or something right yes

590
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:29,360
yes so originally we were gonna have two

591
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:32,279
carrots one on either side of the row

592
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:33,869
right yeah tape opposite directions I've

593
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:35,579
changed it to where I have one sensor

594
00:23:33,869 --> 00:23:38,369
now right in the middle of the row and

595
00:23:35,579 --> 00:23:41,339
then I've run sort of a giant circle or

596
00:23:38,369 --> 00:23:43,349
swirl around that bed so I'm still

597
00:23:41,339 --> 00:23:49,169
getting irrigation on both sides of the

598
00:23:43,349 --> 00:23:51,599
roots and yes yeah so I wanted to answer

599
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:53,850
our tackle some of the questions that we

600
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:56,429
had gotten after our first podcast was

601
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:58,169
Steve so one of the listener concerns

602
00:23:56,430 --> 00:24:00,180
was about water sitting in the line too

603
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:02,630
long or allowing portions of the soil to

604
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:05,670
dry out do you want to comment on that

605
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:07,290
so what do you mean by water sitting in

606
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:09,390
the actual line every time about it

607
00:24:07,289 --> 00:24:12,629
within the a millimeter or 3 millimeter

608
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:14,400
tubing or in the soaker hose I assume

609
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:16,380
they mean either with the idea being

610
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:19,110
that the water wasn't dripping out at a

611
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:24,630
fast enough rate and then somehow that

612
00:24:19,109 --> 00:24:28,049
water was being exposed yeah or leaching

613
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:28,710
from the materials being used I could

614
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:31,349
see that yeah

615
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:33,450
so the thing with a bloom ad system is

616
00:24:31,349 --> 00:24:36,628
the wah the water is continuously

617
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:39,149
flowing or running that's why with our

618
00:24:36,628 --> 00:24:42,240
pump systems we have the pump is pretty

619
00:24:39,148 --> 00:24:45,689
much always on same with a garden hose

620
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:47,788
or like a hose bib system that you're

621
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:50,460
always leaving that on you don't want to

622
00:24:47,788 --> 00:24:52,679
really set a timer with it and then

623
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:54,778
gravity systems obviously the exact same

624
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:57,960
the water is always flowing through the

625
00:24:54,778 --> 00:24:59,519
gravity system so I think one of the

626
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:04,019
questions we were getting and this might

627
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:06,240
be is that within the actual supply line

628
00:25:04,019 --> 00:25:08,099
people were wondering if they could run

629
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:11,490
a timer for that the bloom at was only

630
00:25:08,099 --> 00:25:14,668
on half the time another question was

631
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:16,829
with water with air being within the

632
00:25:14,669 --> 00:25:19,710
actual line so those are two kind of

633
00:25:16,829 --> 00:25:22,189
separate issues in terms of water being

634
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:24,899
in line you want water always in that

635
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:28,320
both 8 millimeter tubing and going into

636
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:29,849
the 3 millimeter tubing so the same with

637
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:31,499
the pump systems those people are always

638
00:25:29,849 --> 00:25:33,990
asking if they have to always be on and

639
00:25:31,499 --> 00:25:36,569
the answer is basically yes because you

640
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:38,609
could theoretically turn it at a timer

641
00:25:36,569 --> 00:25:40,200
so that it turns off the water flowing

642
00:25:38,609 --> 00:25:42,359
at night when you're not using it or

643
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:44,399
something like that and you could do

644
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:46,258
that but the main concern is you want to

645
00:25:44,398 --> 00:25:50,969
make sure that the bloom at always

646
00:25:46,259 --> 00:25:53,639
always has some water within it because

647
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:56,579
for some reason at night time if the

648
00:25:53,638 --> 00:25:59,459
soil did try out and too much water left

649
00:25:56,579 --> 00:26:02,368
the bloom at then you'd have to refill

650
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:04,019
the blue Mets with water which is

651
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:06,418
obviously a concern because if you have

652
00:26:04,019 --> 00:26:10,409
hundreds of plants on blue mats you'd

653
00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:12,389
have to kind of fill each one up and

654
00:26:10,409 --> 00:26:16,590
that's the main reason why a bloom at

655
00:26:12,388 --> 00:26:20,008
system is on 24/7 is because it's always

656
00:26:16,589 --> 00:26:22,168
it always has to be feeding and not

657
00:26:20,009 --> 00:26:24,058
feeding and sensing when water is so if

658
00:26:22,169 --> 00:26:27,028
you turn off the water supply going to

659
00:26:24,058 --> 00:26:29,220
the blue mats it might be fine for an

660
00:26:27,028 --> 00:26:31,798
hour or even longer however long it

661
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:34,200
might take for well kind of the water

662
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:36,690
the plants you've taken the water for

663
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:38,519
the soil to just get more dry but if you

664
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:40,139
overdo it then you're gonna have to

665
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:41,750
probably refill the bloom out with water

666
00:26:40,138 --> 00:26:45,379
to get to be responsive

667
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:47,809
again that kind of I want the kind of

668
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:49,780
button on that one too so my thought was

669
00:26:47,809 --> 00:26:53,029
maybe that the temperature in the line

670
00:26:49,779 --> 00:26:55,759
might get hot on a sunny day well I know

671
00:26:53,029 --> 00:26:58,849
you can bury the lines so what I'm

672
00:26:55,759 --> 00:27:03,589
actually is I'm going through and I have

673
00:26:58,849 --> 00:27:05,539
a larger black thicker hose that I just

674
00:27:03,589 --> 00:27:07,970
picked up at Home Depot and so I'm

675
00:27:05,539 --> 00:27:09,829
running my 8 millimeter inside of that

676
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:11,839
hose and then every time I have a

677
00:27:09,829 --> 00:27:16,399
connector I just cut the larger hose so

678
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:18,589
it's not it's not one like straight line

679
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,180
through but there'll be these gaps and

680
00:27:18,589 --> 00:27:22,099
so then I can bury that thicker hose

681
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:24,620
while protecting my 8 millimeter line

682
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:26,839
because I have customers walking through

683
00:27:24,619 --> 00:27:29,239
my greenhouse it's a you pick green yeah

684
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:30,649
all the time and bumping things so by

685
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:32,089
burying all of that I can keep it

686
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:35,090
protected that also maintains the

687
00:27:32,089 --> 00:27:36,679
temperature in the line so that if it is

688
00:27:35,089 --> 00:27:38,919
a hot sunny day that black line isn't

689
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:41,060
just sitting out there baking in the Sun

690
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:42,769
definitely definitely no and I think

691
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:47,720
that brings up another really great

692
00:27:42,769 --> 00:27:50,420
point is just in terms of the diversity

693
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:52,730
in a bloom at system really where a

694
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:54,019
bloom at kind of you can view and this

695
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:56,029
was a question we were getting allies

696
00:27:54,019 --> 00:27:57,950
people already had drip systems in place

697
00:27:56,029 --> 00:27:59,210
or they already had some plumbing in

698
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:01,220
place and they're asking if they could

699
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:03,200
still use a bloom at system and

700
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:04,730
integrate it within that system or if

701
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,950
they would have to buy it buy all the

702
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:08,930
new supply tubing and all that and the

703
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:11,000
answer is yes you can definitely fit a

704
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:14,450
bloom at system into almost any other

705
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:16,519
type of system usually what it needs the

706
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:18,500
difference what you need is to either

707
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:22,549
add a pressure reducer so that you

708
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:24,140
reduce the pressure down to 15 psi which

709
00:28:22,549 --> 00:28:27,849
is pretty low pressure but that's what a

710
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:31,009
bloom at system works ideally on but we

711
00:28:27,849 --> 00:28:32,869
almost every single system that I design

712
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:35,589
on a daily basis is different because

713
00:28:32,869 --> 00:28:39,500
people might already have a quarter inch

714
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:41,329
regular drip system in place and the

715
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:43,789
really cool and easy thing you can do is

716
00:28:41,329 --> 00:28:45,879
we have all these sorts of fittings that

717
00:28:43,789 --> 00:28:48,259
we have made here in the u.s. actually

718
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:51,500
where it allows you to go from that

719
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:53,890
quarter-inch conventional drip tubing to

720
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:55,680
our three millimeter bloom a drip tube

721
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:57,810
same thing with

722
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:59,580
things people might larger systems with

723
00:28:57,809 --> 00:29:03,389
thousands of plants people might have a

724
00:28:59,579 --> 00:29:05,099
half inch or even full inch PVC kind of

725
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:07,470
plumbing going around the entire

726
00:29:05,099 --> 00:29:09,509
facility or room and it's pretty easy

727
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:10,920
for us to we have a bunch of fittings

728
00:29:09,509 --> 00:29:14,369
that go from either three-quarter inch

729
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:16,560
or half inch that you can kind of allow

730
00:29:14,369 --> 00:29:18,779
to have main header lines where there's

731
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:21,589
bigger water source and then have it

732
00:29:18,779 --> 00:29:24,029
feed off into individual pots or beds

733
00:29:21,589 --> 00:29:25,500
going into a blue medic system so it's

734
00:29:24,029 --> 00:29:26,879
really and I think we're yeah that's

735
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:29,039
what you're kind of saying before you're

736
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,180
gonna have a larger header line and then

737
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:34,559
you're going to be able to go into a

738
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:36,779
smaller conventional drip tubing okay

739
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:38,730
great now one of the other questions I

740
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:40,349
received was can you add nutrients to

741
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:41,789
the line so what's the best way to

742
00:29:40,349 --> 00:29:44,250
fertig eight plants when you're using

743
00:29:41,789 --> 00:29:45,779
blue mats what can you say yeah what

744
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:48,660
can't you send through in terms of like

745
00:29:45,779 --> 00:29:50,879
nutrients enzymes surfactants things

746
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:53,790
like that definitely know that's

747
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:55,980
something people ask a lot and it kind

748
00:29:53,789 --> 00:29:58,710
of depends honestly when it comes down

749
00:29:55,980 --> 00:30:01,079
to it at the end you can use nutrients

750
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:03,150
we have a lot of people that do in fact

751
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:05,069
our we have a nutrient guide that we

752
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:07,560
tend to send to people whenever they ask

753
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:09,809
that and that whole nutrient guide was

754
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:12,269
just us browsing through blogs asking

755
00:30:09,809 --> 00:30:15,690
our customers and friends and just

756
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:18,509
testing ourselves and we found kind of a

757
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:20,460
list of yes nutrients and no nutrients

758
00:30:18,509 --> 00:30:23,910
they want to stay away from what I

759
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:26,730
generally tell people is if the nutrient

760
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:29,310
is pretty water-soluble then you you you

761
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:30,900
pretty much are good to go meaning and

762
00:30:29,309 --> 00:30:33,929
by that I mean if it mixes well with

763
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:36,030
water so as long as a nutrient isn't

764
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:39,150
changing the consistency really harshly

765
00:30:36,029 --> 00:30:41,250
where if it's really thick in nature or

766
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:44,670
really sludgy then you're gonna have a

767
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:46,319
chance to that would have a chance to

768
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:50,220
clog the system just because anything

769
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:52,649
that's really sick in any drip system

770
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:54,750
which uses really small tiny holes to

771
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:56,640
drip to admit the drips then you're

772
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:58,230
gonna actually end up having issues

773
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,390
where it's going to clog the line and

774
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:03,480
it's gonna be kind of a mess but the

775
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:05,100
nutrient is pretty water soluble meaning

776
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:07,110
it mixes well with water and it's not

777
00:31:05,099 --> 00:31:08,808
very thick then people have a lot of

778
00:31:07,109 --> 00:31:11,178
success and in

779
00:31:08,808 --> 00:31:12,678
that list we have just a ton of ton of

780
00:31:11,179 --> 00:31:15,700
green ones

781
00:31:12,679 --> 00:31:20,659
everything from protract to H&amp;G and

782
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:22,249
micro blue maxi bloom bloom bastok the

783
00:31:20,659 --> 00:31:24,590
list just goes on with what people have

784
00:31:22,249 --> 00:31:26,659
had successful is often what people have

785
00:31:24,589 --> 00:31:31,278
said is that using this solution called

786
00:31:26,659 --> 00:31:32,720
drip clean is a go-to just because it it

787
00:31:31,278 --> 00:31:34,460
kind of gets rid of all the

788
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:37,089
crystallization that can go on within

789
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:39,710
the bloom at and it just clears the line

790
00:31:37,089 --> 00:31:41,898
something people also might encounter

791
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:46,509
and I've seen this on Instagram and

792
00:31:41,898 --> 00:31:49,459
stuff is sometimes algae or this type of

793
00:31:46,509 --> 00:31:52,548
basically organic solution just starts

794
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:54,679
growing within usually it's algae and

795
00:31:52,548 --> 00:31:56,898
what you kind of want to do with that

796
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:58,100
biofilm is the other way I just

797
00:31:56,898 --> 00:31:59,449
remembered

798
00:31:58,099 --> 00:32:00,980
usually well you want to do with the

799
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:03,169
biofilm or algae or anything like that

800
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:05,538
is we run a little bit of hydrogen

801
00:32:03,169 --> 00:32:08,690
peroxide solution to just kind of wipe

802
00:32:05,538 --> 00:32:10,460
that out and kill it and so that's the

803
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:12,409
thing you can do with nutrients is just

804
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:14,538
there's some solutions that you can do

805
00:32:12,409 --> 00:32:17,570
to kind of take care of the line and

806
00:32:14,538 --> 00:32:18,888
just keep it clean so generally I love

807
00:32:17,569 --> 00:32:21,528
to just keep it simple and I don't

808
00:32:18,888 --> 00:32:24,678
really run nutrients inside my my drip

809
00:32:21,528 --> 00:32:26,778
line it'll kind of just it just it's

810
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:29,629
less hassle in the future and then what

811
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:32,419
I do is a nutrient well meaning I kind

812
00:32:29,628 --> 00:32:36,528
of just dig a little hole into the into

813
00:32:32,419 --> 00:32:38,869
the soil and add my nutrient kind of

814
00:32:36,528 --> 00:32:41,298
outside of the drip system and what a

815
00:32:38,868 --> 00:32:44,509
nutrient well does really is essentially

816
00:32:41,298 --> 00:32:48,230
allows the nutrient to feed slowly into

817
00:32:44,509 --> 00:32:50,089
the into your plant so if you're away

818
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:52,669
for a few days that's a good solution

819
00:32:50,089 --> 00:32:55,428
with nutrients if not just hand feeding

820
00:32:52,669 --> 00:32:56,929
is always a good idea if you do want to

821
00:32:55,429 --> 00:32:59,659
run nutrients through which I know a lot

822
00:32:56,929 --> 00:33:01,070
of people do then you can there just

823
00:32:59,659 --> 00:33:02,840
might be some future maintenance you

824
00:33:01,069 --> 00:33:05,210
have to do the other thing is we do have

825
00:33:02,839 --> 00:33:08,209
dosatron systems that work with larger

826
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:09,528
scale blue mat systems and if you need

827
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:12,110
help designing those or if you have

828
00:33:09,528 --> 00:33:14,599
questions and you can always ask us so

829
00:33:12,109 --> 00:33:17,240
the answer is yes you can run nutrients

830
00:33:14,599 --> 00:33:18,859
in a blue mat system it's just that you

831
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:20,839
might have to end up doing a little

832
00:33:18,859 --> 00:33:23,119
maintenance to make sure you don't clog

833
00:33:20,839 --> 00:33:25,429
the line or anything like that

834
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:27,469
now I'll just share that my opinion on

835
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:29,570
it is is my preference is not like you

836
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:32,150
mentioned not to run any nutrients or

837
00:33:29,569 --> 00:33:35,029
other additives through that system

838
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:38,120
besides water and for all the reasons

839
00:33:35,029 --> 00:33:41,149
you mentioned plus the dangers of

840
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:43,459
biofilm and it's real easy I think to

841
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:45,110
just take especially with organics if

842
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:46,819
we're doing if we want to add say

843
00:33:45,109 --> 00:33:48,469
seaweed extract powder I can mix that

844
00:33:46,819 --> 00:33:49,189
with water and just water it in over the

845
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:51,170
top

846
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:52,759
same with compost teas I wouldn't send

847
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:55,250
those through either cuz yeah remember

848
00:33:52,759 --> 00:33:57,019
three millimeters is not very big it's a

849
00:33:55,250 --> 00:34:03,500
pretty small hole so a lot of stuff can

850
00:33:57,019 --> 00:34:07,369
clog it do you want to talk a little bit

851
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:09,769
about how people are using them with a

852
00:34:07,369 --> 00:34:11,839
pump and when that might come into play

853
00:34:09,769 --> 00:34:14,840
for some growers in certain settings

854
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:17,600
yeah yeah definitely so essentially a

855
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:19,100
pump system is just a another way of

856
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:22,219
saying it's just a pressure system and

857
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:25,279
pumps really come into play when people

858
00:34:22,219 --> 00:34:27,139
don't have the either the room size to

859
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,090
do a gravity system because you either

860
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:31,940
the ceiling isn't high enough or

861
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:34,940
something like that or that they just

862
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:37,490
don't have a hose bib within the

863
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:39,650
facility either because the alternative

864
00:34:37,489 --> 00:34:41,329
to getting a pump is just getting our

865
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:43,970
pressure reducer and you connect that to

866
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:47,960
a regular spigot or hose bib or even

867
00:34:43,969 --> 00:34:49,579
garden hose itself so that's what people

868
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:51,320
use a pump system generally in a

869
00:34:49,579 --> 00:34:54,799
facility that doesn't already have that

870
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:58,250
or when they essentially want to pump

871
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:59,810
out of a barrel of water a reservoir but

872
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:02,210
don't want to raise the reservoir high

873
00:34:59,809 --> 00:35:04,969
enough a lot of cases people have

874
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:08,659
nutrients in their in that barrel in

875
00:35:04,969 --> 00:35:10,789
their 50 gallon drum so then they want

876
00:35:08,659 --> 00:35:13,879
to pump that nutrient out so that's the

877
00:35:10,789 --> 00:35:16,460
other way of using a pump system and you

878
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:18,950
can use your own pumps the main thing is

879
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:22,220
you have to connect bloom at pressure

880
00:35:18,949 --> 00:35:24,109
reducer to it and get it down to 15 psi

881
00:35:22,219 --> 00:35:25,219
and the reason why I'm saying the bloom

882
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:26,630
at pressure reducer

883
00:35:25,219 --> 00:35:29,959
is because you're going to have a hard

884
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:33,890
time going to a regular hardware store

885
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:35,730
and finding a pressure reducer that goes

886
00:35:33,889 --> 00:35:38,099
into eight millimeter line

887
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:39,929
while our producers do that another

888
00:35:38,099 --> 00:35:41,699
reason is we have tested out other

889
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:43,980
pressure reducers in our systems and

890
00:35:41,699 --> 00:35:46,739
found that they actually don't really

891
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:49,170
reduce the pressure to that the actual

892
00:35:46,739 --> 00:35:50,939
rate that you want it to be instead they

893
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:53,190
just would restrict the flow but the

894
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:55,050
pressure would still be pretty high so I

895
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:57,000
would say I definitely recommend getting

896
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:59,850
a bloom a pressure reducer than trying

897
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,320
to kind of cheap out and get a one that

898
00:35:59,849 --> 00:36:04,799
would isn't actually going to be

899
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:08,940
reducing the pressure and why you would

900
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:12,000
want to use a pump is usually when you

901
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:13,559
have more than about 50 plants and you

902
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:18,059
just need to get enough pressure to do

903
00:36:13,559 --> 00:36:21,210
that like I was saying with the pumps

904
00:36:18,059 --> 00:36:23,519
though it's the other reasoning you want

905
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:26,159
to get kind of our pump kits is that

906
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:28,500
everything is included from the pressure

907
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:30,509
tank our pumps we use have a built-in

908
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:33,510
pressure switch that's something you'd

909
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:35,130
need and then they has all the fittings

910
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:37,650
and components that kind of attach it

911
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:40,710
together and we know that the pumps we

912
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:42,960
use are rated for continuous use so if

913
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:44,670
you try using other pumps that aren't

914
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:48,119
rated for continuous use or don't have

915
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:50,280
this pressure switch you tend to run the

916
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:51,930
risk of burning them out and then you're

917
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:54,090
just out another couple hundred dollars

918
00:36:51,929 --> 00:36:56,730
and you might want to still just end up

919
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:58,320
buying the pressure pump so to answer

920
00:36:56,730 --> 00:37:00,570
your question yeah

921
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:05,970
the reasoning to use a pressure pump is

922
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:08,160
usually for larger scale grows and also

923
00:37:05,969 --> 00:37:10,919
in cases where you can't get a gravity

924
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:13,559
system high enough or you don't have a

925
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:16,349
built in hose bigger or anything like

926
00:37:13,559 --> 00:37:19,349
that okay no pumps this ones are great

927
00:37:16,349 --> 00:37:21,630
yeah the last question I had was one of

928
00:37:19,349 --> 00:37:24,239
the other methods for irrigation that's

929
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:26,550
really popular in this community or in

930
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:29,099
terms of low tech solutions is sub

931
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:30,750
irrigated planters or sips how do you

932
00:37:29,099 --> 00:37:32,368
feel blue mats compared with sips are

933
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:35,250
you familiar with what I'm describing

934
00:37:32,369 --> 00:37:37,410
here yeah yeah none I've seen on YouTube

935
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:39,239
and so no no these kind of clickbait

936
00:37:37,409 --> 00:37:40,529
articles that actually end up being

937
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:43,589
really cool how to kind of create your

938
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:46,290
own automated watering system and it

939
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:47,789
almost kind of works similar to a blue

940
00:37:46,289 --> 00:37:49,909
mat the difference is you're kind of

941
00:37:47,789 --> 00:37:53,900
over feeding water for

942
00:37:49,909 --> 00:37:56,210
and a consistent rate and we have bloom

943
00:37:53,900 --> 00:38:00,170
at bottle adapters that literally do the

944
00:37:56,210 --> 00:38:02,599
exact same thing you connected to a two

945
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:05,960
liter coke bottle and it just feeds a

946
00:38:02,599 --> 00:38:08,210
certain amount of water per day and I

947
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:09,679
love the idea honestly so it's kind of

948
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:12,530
really cool to engineering behind these

949
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:16,308
were essentially it's the same property

950
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:18,109
that a blue mat works off where the soil

951
00:38:16,309 --> 00:38:21,559
is kind of acting as a semipermeable

952
00:38:18,108 --> 00:38:24,440
membrane where water is being wet in and

953
00:38:21,559 --> 00:38:26,660
out consistently the difference is with

954
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:29,269
those systems as I mentioned you're just

955
00:38:26,659 --> 00:38:31,788
watering at a consistent kind of rate

956
00:38:29,269 --> 00:38:34,759
you're basically just to keep the soil

957
00:38:31,789 --> 00:38:37,549
wet while a blue mat kind of monitors

958
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:39,650
when it needs to be watered and we have

959
00:38:37,548 --> 00:38:42,670
really really just this great article

960
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:45,740
that was written on marijuana adventure

961
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:49,430
essentially and they wrote it on blue

962
00:38:45,739 --> 00:38:52,759
mats eventually because there's just

963
00:38:49,429 --> 00:38:54,078
this huge this hidden killer that people

964
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:55,730
don't really know about which is

965
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:58,039
essentially over watering your plants

966
00:38:55,730 --> 00:39:00,889
and that tends to happen a lot of times

967
00:38:58,039 --> 00:39:02,809
when people hand feed as well because

968
00:39:00,889 --> 00:39:04,940
then they'll just use a bucket and throw

969
00:39:02,809 --> 00:39:07,069
water on top of the plant and what the

970
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:09,289
plant is doing when it gets over watered

971
00:39:07,068 --> 00:39:12,259
at first it's essentially like being too

972
00:39:09,289 --> 00:39:14,569
full if you eat too much so you're not

973
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:16,460
going to really want to eat more but

974
00:39:14,568 --> 00:39:18,528
what's happening at the plant is when

975
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:21,670
that's happening it can't even use the

976
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:24,980
water that's in the in the soil because

977
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:27,349
at a but basically at a deep down

978
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:30,079
biological level the stomata is over

979
00:39:27,349 --> 00:39:33,380
filled meaning it can't use the water

980
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:34,849
and I think everyone knows how kind of

981
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:36,619
photosynthesis and everything works

982
00:39:34,849 --> 00:39:40,010
where a plant is using that sunlight

983
00:39:36,619 --> 00:39:43,369
plus the water to create sugars within

984
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:45,559
the plant and when you overwater those

985
00:39:43,369 --> 00:39:47,390
sugars aren't being created for there's

986
00:39:45,559 --> 00:39:48,980
a kind of a delay with those sugars

987
00:39:47,389 --> 00:39:51,828
being created because the plant is so

988
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:53,838
full so the plant isn't growing it's

989
00:39:51,829 --> 00:39:55,849
really hard to see that the plant is

990
00:39:53,838 --> 00:39:57,828
isn't enjoying it either because the

991
00:39:55,849 --> 00:39:59,630
leaves still stay green they don't turn

992
00:39:57,829 --> 00:40:02,510
dry or anything like they do when you

993
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:03,410
under water but the plant isn't growing

994
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:07,250
either it's just

995
00:40:03,409 --> 00:40:08,328
kind of at this hibernated state so

996
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:09,139
that's the hidden killer with

997
00:40:08,329 --> 00:40:11,599
over-watering

998
00:40:09,139 --> 00:40:14,750
and that's what some of these systems

999
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:17,150
where you're basically just feeding from

1000
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:19,278
below and keeping it saturated all the

1001
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:20,960
time is you kind of run the risk of that

1002
00:40:19,278 --> 00:40:23,150
happening where the plant isn't going to

1003
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:26,170
die but at the same time isn't going to

1004
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:28,670
grow so I'd say for higher valued plants

1005
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:31,190
bloom at systems pretty ideal for that

1006
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:33,440
exact reason where it's not gonna over

1007
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:35,720
water at one point but it is going to

1008
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:38,509
keep it it is gonna water it throughout

1009
00:40:35,719 --> 00:40:40,250
the plant growing and when a plant needs

1010
00:40:38,509 --> 00:40:42,798
more water the bloom that accounts for

1011
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:45,829
that so keep it waters more it's more

1012
00:40:42,798 --> 00:40:47,659
water into the system and when it's

1013
00:40:45,829 --> 00:40:50,210
smaller it's using less water so it's

1014
00:40:47,659 --> 00:40:51,528
not going to overdo it then either so I

1015
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:54,170
think that's the main difference is

1016
00:40:51,528 --> 00:40:56,028
those systems work great for plants that

1017
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:58,068
you don't really care about how they

1018
00:40:56,028 --> 00:41:00,768
grow or how big they get or anything

1019
00:40:58,068 --> 00:41:03,469
like that but in a system where you do

1020
00:41:00,768 --> 00:41:06,679
want to get a plant to yield as much as

1021
00:41:03,469 --> 00:41:09,048
it can and to really grow at its best

1022
00:41:06,679 --> 00:41:10,750
rate then in that case a bloom at

1023
00:41:09,048 --> 00:41:15,108
systems kind of the better alternative

1024
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:17,028
versus these other automated well you

1025
00:41:15,108 --> 00:41:19,098
know I want to say I do like the idea of

1026
00:41:17,028 --> 00:41:23,568
sub irrigated planters I think they work

1027
00:41:19,099 --> 00:41:25,548
pretty well yeah plants my because it is

1028
00:41:23,568 --> 00:41:28,068
a wicking process so as the soil dries

1029
00:41:25,548 --> 00:41:32,358
out more that water will be pulled up

1030
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:34,548
into the soil column from from below my

1031
00:41:32,358 --> 00:41:36,380
issue with them is that when you first

1032
00:41:34,548 --> 00:41:37,818
transplant the plant into that system

1033
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:39,019
you're still going to need to water it

1034
00:41:37,818 --> 00:41:41,028
and this can be a challenge sometimes

1035
00:41:39,018 --> 00:41:42,558
with blue mats too in that that area

1036
00:41:41,028 --> 00:41:44,690
right in the rhizosphere there around

1037
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:46,460
the roots may not be getting enough

1038
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:49,970
water even though that pot is still

1039
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:51,829
heavy and has a lot of water so in those

1040
00:41:49,969 --> 00:41:54,048
cases you're still you're still top

1041
00:41:51,829 --> 00:41:57,170
watering and specifically with cannabis

1042
00:41:54,048 --> 00:41:59,509
I've found it seems to me that and this

1043
00:41:57,170 --> 00:42:02,269
is anecdotal that top-down watering

1044
00:41:59,509 --> 00:42:04,880
seems to be more effective overall which

1045
00:42:02,268 --> 00:42:07,489
is why I've always chosen that over sub

1046
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:10,519
your gate planners but as a new grower I

1047
00:42:07,489 --> 00:42:12,828
know a lot of people will use sips or

1048
00:42:10,518 --> 00:42:15,379
earth boxes as an alternative as a way

1049
00:42:12,829 --> 00:42:15,920
of watering when you're not as familiar

1050
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:17,660
with

1051
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:19,190
proper watering or have a system like

1052
00:42:17,659 --> 00:42:22,549
blue mats that allows you to dial that

1053
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:24,289
in so exactly exactly I mean at the end

1054
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:26,300
of the day we just want to also get

1055
00:42:24,289 --> 00:42:28,820
water to the plants that's why I'm fully

1056
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:30,860
supportive of segregating planters or

1057
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:32,480
anything like that because as long as

1058
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:35,960
you don't forget to water your plant

1059
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:37,190
your plants gonna live and that's what

1060
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:38,829
we kind of want at the end of the day

1061
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:42,559
our goal is to just have happy plants

1062
00:42:38,829 --> 00:42:43,699
whatever works for that yeah well I want

1063
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:47,389
to say thanks for taking the time today

1064
00:42:43,699 --> 00:42:49,429
to chats I know that you've sent me this

1065
00:42:47,389 --> 00:42:51,199
new tips and tricks article which I can

1066
00:42:49,429 --> 00:42:53,569
post up on the podcast page for people

1067
00:42:51,199 --> 00:42:55,730
if they have further questions they can

1068
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:56,990
contact me or damien directly I'll put

00:42:55,730 --> 00:43:00,380
all your information up there on the

1070
00:42:56,989 --> 00:43:02,479
podcast page and perfect yeah you know

00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,050
saying I love listening to your podcast

1074
00:43:06,619 --> 00:43:11,029
as well myself so it's a huge pleasure

1075
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:12,289
to be here and I know one thing I've

1076
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:14,420
been seeing and people have been telling

1077
00:43:12,289 --> 00:43:16,670
me on Instagram and whatnot is now

1078
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:20,900
they're choosing your podcasts as kind

1079
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:22,670
of a default method or a podcast to hear

1080
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:24,800
when they're commuting to work or

1081
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:27,289
whatnot and I'm thinking I might just do

1082
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:29,240
the same that cool well I appreciate

1083
00:43:27,289 --> 00:43:31,610
that and stay tuned we may have
