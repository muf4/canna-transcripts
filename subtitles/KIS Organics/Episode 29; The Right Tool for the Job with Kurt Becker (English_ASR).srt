DRAM Corporation for anyone looking to

19
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,710
improve the efficacy of their spray

20
00:00:53,909 --> 00:00:57,718
applications I highly suggest checking

21
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:00,239
out this podcast and reaching out to

22
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:02,010
dram directly I got to hear Kurt speak

23
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:04,140
at a bio controlls conference last year

24
00:01:02,009 --> 00:01:06,658
and he is a genius when it comes to

25
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,129
spray applications for the past 23 years

26
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:09,719
current has worked with growers to

27
00:01:08,129 --> 00:01:11,759
improve their spray and irrigation

28
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:15,179
practices through improved technology

29
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,368
and technique DRAM now in its 76th year

30
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,590
is a leader in horticultural technology

31
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:21,540
focusing on watering chemical

32
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,939
application air movement and water

33
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,969
quality hey Kurt welcome to the podcast

34
00:01:23,938 --> 00:01:29,129
thanks for coming on today thanks dad

35
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:30,929
appreciate you having me yeah can we

36
00:01:29,129 --> 00:01:32,908
start out giving listeners a little bit

37
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:35,430
of a background into your history and

38
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:37,700
how you came into this role and all this

39
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:41,189
knowledge regarding spray applications

40
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:43,320
well most of that is on the job I

41
00:01:41,188 --> 00:01:45,000
studied you know political science in

42
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:46,889
college I worked in banking before I got

43
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,259
into the horticultural industry I've

44
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:54,420
been doing this for 24 and 1/2 years as

45
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:58,319
after a sales role took me into the

46
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:59,519
company and as in those 24 years you

47
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:02,250
know I've been very active in developing

48
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:05,609
a lot of our product line on the Spray

49
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:08,729
side as well as what we as a lot about

50
00:02:05,609 --> 00:02:10,080
as well as on our philosophies and in

51
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:13,890
working on a lot of the science behind

52
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,960
what we do from a spray standpoint Oh

53
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:18,989
that timeframe jerem has really focused

54
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:20,610
on you know different particle sizes do

55
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:22,050
different things and making sure that we

56
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:24,000
think either we know how to make a

57
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:26,189
different sized droplet the trick is

58
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,849
knowing how to make that applicable to

59
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:32,009
plant protection and so we've developed

60
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:32,989
a number of different tools over that

61
00:02:32,009 --> 00:02:35,609
time frame

62
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:38,280
during my tenure at the company that

63
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:40,200
basically focus on you know okay we want

64
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,180
to try and achieve this so we make a

65
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:44,280
droplet that does that or we want you

66
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,930
know we need this much force to get him

67
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,520
in the canopy all sorts of things that

68
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:49,530
basically all of our different equipment

69
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:52,050
is designed to do slightly different

70
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:55,229
things so it's why we have you know I

71
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:59,580
think we make over 37 different machines

72
00:02:55,229 --> 00:03:01,738
for indoor plant protection we don't

73
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:03,269
really make equipment for outdoors and

74
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:05,189
some of our stuff could be used that way

75
00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:07,830
but the majority of what we've done and

76
00:03:05,189 --> 00:03:11,069
where we focus is for indoor plant

77
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:14,010
growth now when you say indoor you're

78
00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:16,500
talking about greenhouse environments as

79
00:03:14,009 --> 00:03:18,030
well correct any indoor yeah well that's

80
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,879
where we start I mean we are the trim is

81
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:22,620
a 77 year old company and we've been

82
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,289
involved in the in the greenhouse

83
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:27,569
industry indoor meaning you got walls

84
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:29,189
and you got a ceiling and so there's

85
00:03:27,569 --> 00:03:31,379
there's really different characteristics

86
00:03:29,189 --> 00:03:32,519
of a spray that you require and there's

87
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:34,439
different concerns that you might have

88
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:38,370
you know when you're spraying outside

89
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:40,769
versus spraying inside you know a lot of

90
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:42,569
outdoor spray equipment tends to use

91
00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:45,269
bigger droplets tends to be wet or

92
00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:48,060
applications unless we really bring an

93
00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:50,009
aerial and you need to do that because

94
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,379
there's a lot of concerns one is drift

95
00:03:50,009 --> 00:03:55,909
management we don't want to spray the

96
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:59,069
neighbors farm we don't want to you know

97
00:03:55,909 --> 00:04:00,949
have stuff drifting into different crops

98
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:04,590
that we don't that we don't want to

99
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:05,669
apply a pesticide to indoor it's very

100
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:08,579
different I'm not really worried about

101
00:04:05,669 --> 00:04:11,849
I'm not really worried about intrusion

102
00:04:08,579 --> 00:04:15,599
into other crops so that allows us to

103
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:19,769
use a much wider range of droplet sizes

104
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:21,719
to achieve better coverage if you look

105
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:24,720
outside a really aerial applications

106
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,520
work very well in very wide open spaces

107
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,450
where you've got the same crop over and

108
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:30,419
over again and some

109
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:32,519
use an aerial application which is using

110
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:34,350
generally smaller droplets although

111
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:37,169
still much larger than some of the stuff

112
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:39,420
that we can create for indoor use and

113
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:41,250
the intent there is that they can cover

114
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:42,810
a lot greater area a quicker but they

115
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:45,120
also do it with a lot less liquid

116
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:46,740
because can't carry you know a tanker

117
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,250
load full of liquid on the plane that

118
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:51,480
you'd be using to apply the pesticide in

119
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,589
our instance I'm not really worried

120
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,379
about the amount of water that we're

121
00:04:52,589 --> 00:04:57,979
going to apply from transferring it and

122
00:04:55,379 --> 00:05:00,719
carrying it standpoint it's more about

123
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:03,600
using smaller droplets and then we just

124
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,160
need less water to do the job because we

125
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,220
can create cover much more surface area

126
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:09,630
the smaller droplets we get so you're

127
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:12,960
talking about droplet size and how it

128
00:05:09,629 --> 00:05:15,329
affects an application and what I'm

129
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:17,339
hearing is that the smaller the droplet

130
00:05:15,329 --> 00:05:19,109
size the better surface area or better

131
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:22,799
coverage you get over that leaf surface

132
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:24,770
are there other considerations pretty

133
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,360
much that that's the that's the

134
00:05:24,769 --> 00:05:30,349
important effect to pull out of that the

135
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,970
basically it's not only showing a linear

136
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:35,970
relationship it's actually exponential

137
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:38,280
when we drop when we cut particle size

138
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:40,170
we got droplets down into smaller sizes

139
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:42,529
we cover a lot more surface area because

140
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:45,540
they themselves have more surface area a

141
00:05:42,529 --> 00:05:49,019
pretty common graphic that we that we

142
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:50,580
like to use in in communicating that is

143
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:54,479
just explaining that okay if we took one

144
00:05:50,579 --> 00:05:56,339
100 micron droplet the liquid contained

145
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,689
in 100 micron drop 100 microns is

146
00:05:56,339 --> 00:05:59,279
already pretty small that's about the

147
00:05:57,689 --> 00:06:01,829
size of your hair the diameter of your

148
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:05,939
hair is about 100 microns if we took one

149
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:07,800
droplet that was 100 microns and we cut

150
00:06:05,939 --> 00:06:09,540
it in two in that same amount of liquid

151
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,300
we took that same amount of liquid and

152
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:14,910
made droplets that were 50 microns okay

153
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:19,590
with the same fluid volume we would get

154
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:21,900
eight droplets that would be the same

155
00:06:19,589 --> 00:06:23,039
volume of liquid but we would be able to

156
00:06:21,899 --> 00:06:24,929
cover more surface area cuz you know

157
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:27,600
eight droplets just by cutting the

158
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:29,250
particle size in half if we take that

159
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,790
and we cut it to a tenth of the original

160
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:35,420
size or about ten microns we get about a

161
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:40,500
thousand droplets with the same liquid

162
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:41,129
contained in the 100 micron droplet so

163
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,899
again we can come

164
00:06:41,129 --> 00:06:45,778
much more surface area if you think

165
00:06:42,899 --> 00:06:49,559
about majority of what we're using to

166
00:06:45,778 --> 00:06:53,038
spray plants is water-based there are

167
00:06:49,559 --> 00:06:54,689
oil based products very few generally

168
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:56,519
those are never used without without

169
00:06:54,689 --> 00:06:57,778
something else not without being

170
00:06:56,519 --> 00:07:00,329
dissolved in something which is

171
00:06:57,778 --> 00:07:02,009
typically water so if you think about

172
00:07:00,329 --> 00:07:04,498
water water has a very very strong

173
00:07:02,009 --> 00:07:05,999
surface tension it tends to bead up we

174
00:07:04,499 --> 00:07:07,769
can chemically alter that using

175
00:07:05,999 --> 00:07:11,429
surfactants and things like that to help

176
00:07:07,769 --> 00:07:12,959
it spread more evenly but oil in it has

177
00:07:11,428 --> 00:07:14,848
a very low surface tension so it's

178
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:16,050
spreads it early evenly it's why it's a

179
00:07:14,848 --> 00:07:19,468
good lubricant it spreads out over

180
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:21,119
surfaces if you think about what we're

181
00:07:19,468 --> 00:07:23,819
doing we're basically doing the same

182
00:07:21,119 --> 00:07:27,419
thing mechanically that a surfactant

183
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:30,269
might do we're taking that large droplet

184
00:07:27,418 --> 00:07:32,008
and we're making it into a ship we're

185
00:07:30,269 --> 00:07:33,329
spreading it out we happen to be doing

186
00:07:32,009 --> 00:07:35,718
it by chopping it up into tiny little

187
00:07:33,329 --> 00:07:38,519
droplets and spreading it more evenly

188
00:07:35,718 --> 00:07:42,629
instead of a liquid that that spreads on

189
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:44,819
its own but the effect is the same we're

190
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:46,559
covering much more surface area if we

191
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:50,429
take that same example the 100 micron

192
00:07:46,559 --> 00:07:52,079
drop when we cut it to to a twentieth of

193
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:54,628
the size or about five micron droplets

194
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:58,588
which is something we can do we get

195
00:07:54,629 --> 00:08:01,169
about 19,000 droplets with the same

196
00:07:58,588 --> 00:08:04,588
liquid contained in the one 100 micron

197
00:08:01,168 --> 00:08:06,058
droplet so if you think to be at the you

198
00:08:04,588 --> 00:08:08,038
know 100 microns is at the very low end

199
00:08:06,059 --> 00:08:09,329
of hydraulics brain there's not a lot of

200
00:08:08,038 --> 00:08:10,949
hydraulic sprayers that put out a

201
00:08:09,329 --> 00:08:15,059
droplet with an average particle size

202
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:16,829
that's small when we talking about some

203
00:08:15,059 --> 00:08:19,079
of the fog type systems that we have

204
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:21,348
we're in you know we've got directed fog

205
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:23,999
that is a 50 micron droplet we've got

206
00:08:21,348 --> 00:08:26,338
ultra low volume fogs that are in the 5

207
00:08:23,999 --> 00:08:28,379
to 10 micron droplets so we can cover a

208
00:08:26,338 --> 00:08:30,118
lot more surface area which is really

209
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:32,188
where that term actually gets its name

210
00:08:30,119 --> 00:08:33,649
low volume and ultra low volume is

211
00:08:32,188 --> 00:08:37,379
really referring to the amount of liquid

212
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:38,818
that's used to make the application and

213
00:08:37,379 --> 00:08:43,019
those are in our terms those are those

214
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:45,599
are industry terms the nice thing about

215
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:46,799
that even when we talk about hydraulic

216
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,149
sprays because there's a lot of times

217
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:50,039
right when hydraulic sprays are very

218
00:08:48,149 --> 00:08:53,039
applicable and fog is not always the

219
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:55,309
best choice but understanding that

220
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:57,230
relationship of if I take a

221
00:08:55,309 --> 00:08:59,388
and I cut it in it cut the average

222
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:01,129
particle size in half I'm going to get

223
00:08:59,389 --> 00:09:04,639
about eight times more droplets with the

224
00:09:01,129 --> 00:09:06,708
same liquid in the tank give you give it

225
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:08,690
basically illustrates the idea that it's

226
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:10,879
one we can create smaller droplets even

227
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:12,800
if we don't you know go all the way down

228
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:14,059
the spectrum we just cut them in half we

229
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:16,429
can cover certain we can cover more

230
00:09:14,059 --> 00:09:19,429
surface area much more effectively than

231
00:09:16,429 --> 00:09:21,409
we can with bigger droplets and so in a

232
00:09:19,429 --> 00:09:24,409
greenhouse or an indoor space where

233
00:09:21,409 --> 00:09:28,129
we're not really worried about wind

234
00:09:24,409 --> 00:09:30,379
drift contaminating other crops we might

235
00:09:28,129 --> 00:09:32,539
be spring the whole room you know using

236
00:09:30,379 --> 00:09:36,259
the smallest droplet applicable for that

237
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:37,490
is generally going to be a good thing so

238
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:39,769
just so I understand when you're not

239
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:41,120
taking that hundred micron droplet and

240
00:09:39,769 --> 00:09:42,409
cutting it in half in your example

241
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,440
you're saying that if you sprayed a

242
00:09:42,409 --> 00:09:49,458
gallon of 100 micron droplets versus a

243
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,990
gallon of say a hundred or a gallon of

244
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:52,909
50 micro droplets you're going to get

245
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:55,278
eight times the coverage would that

246
00:09:52,909 --> 00:09:56,809
exactly okay I want to make sure I

247
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:59,689
understood the math on there that that

248
00:09:56,809 --> 00:10:01,338
makes a lot of sense actually so that

249
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:06,170
brings me up to my next question which

250
00:10:01,339 --> 00:10:09,199
was can you use a hundred micron droplet

251
00:10:06,169 --> 00:10:11,149
or a sprayer like that with a surfactant

252
00:10:09,198 --> 00:10:14,899
and achieve the same results as you

253
00:10:11,149 --> 00:10:16,458
would with a smaller droplet size not

254
00:10:14,899 --> 00:10:18,589
necessarily the same results but

255
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:20,929
surfactants are always a good idea as

256
00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:22,310
long as you know they're they're safe on

257
00:10:20,929 --> 00:10:23,708
the plant you're going to be flying them

258
00:10:22,309 --> 00:10:26,448
too and they're labeled for that plant

259
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:28,458
or the use

260
00:10:26,448 --> 00:10:29,870
surfactants are generally a very good

261
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:32,359
idea because you're going to cover more

262
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:35,089
surface area but you got to get them

263
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,769
there too and so that's where that's

264
00:10:35,089 --> 00:10:38,930
where smaller droplets tend to sometimes

265
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:42,078
have an advantage you also won't ever

266
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:45,019
get to the to the reduction in volume

267
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:47,328
that you will so before talking about

268
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:48,709
wet spraying or hydraulic spraying even

269
00:10:47,328 --> 00:10:50,629
if we're talking about targeted low

270
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:52,698
volume so kind of break the world down

271
00:10:50,629 --> 00:10:55,009
into hydraulic sprays or the wet

272
00:10:52,698 --> 00:10:58,068
sprayers that's you know you're you're

273
00:10:55,009 --> 00:11:00,230
spraying a gallon two gallon and a half

274
00:10:58,068 --> 00:11:04,969
a minute the plants are going to be

275
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:07,990
visibly wet when you've after you've

276
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:07,990
done your job

277
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:12,190
you know that's the typical hydraulic

278
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:13,779
spray that people think of we talk about

279
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:17,500
targeted low volume we're basically

280
00:11:13,779 --> 00:11:19,929
taking down that spectrum we're creating

281
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:22,539
droplets in the 50 40 to 60 micron range

282
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:27,509
typically where we're able to then use a

283
00:11:22,539 --> 00:11:31,659
lot less water a higher concentration of

284
00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:33,100
product to water so we reduce similar

285
00:11:31,659 --> 00:11:35,919
amounts of pesticide we just put it in

286
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:37,659
less liquid and then we would aim that

287
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:38,979
as well so there's different types of

288
00:11:37,659 --> 00:11:40,959
machines that we can use to aim that

289
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:42,730
into the crop so that we can be

290
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:45,460
selective about where it wants to go so

291
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:47,700
in that instance where I mentioned

292
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:50,440
drifted is generally not a concern

293
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:52,870
indoors in a greenhouse sometimes it is

294
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:55,420
sometimes I don't want to hit the bench

295
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:58,810
next to the one I'm trying to treat and

296
00:11:55,419 --> 00:12:00,699
so an ultra low volume treatment when we

297
00:11:58,809 --> 00:12:03,879
get into that five and 10 micron range

298
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:05,830
that is a space treatment that's flea

299
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:08,590
bomb so your cat comes home with fleas

300
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:11,889
you need to bomb the whole house to kill

301
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:14,620
them all that's what ultra low volume is

302
00:12:11,889 --> 00:12:17,439
we are filling the space with pesticides

303
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:20,080
and you can't do a bench you are doing

304
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,870
the entire room at that point when we

305
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:25,509
want to just treat a bench or a portion

306
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:29,379
of a bench targeted low volume where we

307
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:32,470
can use smaller droplets but not as

308
00:12:29,379 --> 00:12:35,230
small as we could go we can aim that and

309
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:36,820
and had it not float away and drift

310
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:38,590
around the whole house those droplets

311
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:40,780
tend to follow them much quicker than

312
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:44,139
say a 5 to 10 micron droplet which can

313
00:12:40,779 --> 00:12:46,449
stay airborne for as much as 3 to 4

314
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:49,480
hours how do these smaller droplets

315
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:52,230
affect humidity then over time they must

316
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:55,389
raise it quite a bit I would think

317
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:58,360
actually not yes well if we look at a

318
00:12:55,389 --> 00:13:00,460
typical application generally not those

319
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:02,440
types of nozzles can be used or or

320
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:05,110
nozzles creating similar droplets can be

321
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:09,430
used to affect humidity for instance a

322
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:10,750
frog system so we fell in in other types

323
00:13:09,429 --> 00:13:14,559
of systems we do besides spray

324
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:17,879
application we do moisture management we

325
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:20,349
do irrigation systems we do you know

326
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:22,179
missing systems for propagation with

327
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:25,028
your drip irrigation and stuff like that

328
00:13:22,179 --> 00:13:26,319
we have nozzles that will create 80

329
00:13:25,028 --> 00:13:27,730
micron droplets and there's other

330
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,920
companies that have drops that have

331
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:32,440
systems that will create their with high

332
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:35,019
pressure that can create 10 to 10 10 10

333
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:36,339
to 20 microns those are typically

334
00:13:35,019 --> 00:13:38,079
distributed systems where you have a

335
00:13:36,339 --> 00:13:39,490
pipe running on your nozzles all over

336
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:43,660
the place and each one of those nozzles

337
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:47,139
is going to maybe put out you know 5 3

338
00:13:43,659 --> 00:13:51,039
to 5 liters per hour of liquid when we

339
00:13:47,139 --> 00:13:54,159
look at what we do we're going to do a

340
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:56,740
similar output but we're gonna do that

341
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:58,778
for with one novel and we're gonna do

342
00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:02,740
that from one location to try and spread

343
00:13:58,778 --> 00:14:05,019
the pesticide around so you if we if we

344
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:07,659
use more volume in or if we continued

345
00:14:05,019 --> 00:14:09,429
that operation through a long period we

346
00:14:07,659 --> 00:14:11,889
can increase the humidity but generally

347
00:14:09,429 --> 00:14:12,989
if I say I take a 10,000 square-foot

348
00:14:11,889 --> 00:14:16,360
space

349
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:18,159
we're generally not adding more than 2

350
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,080
litres of liquid to that or half a

351
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:23,079
gallon when we're doing a pesticide

352
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:25,480
application so it's it's generally not

353
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:26,860
effective admitted grammatically and

354
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,389
then when you think about it if you

355
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:30,550
compare that to something like a wet

356
00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:34,439
spray if I'm going to put 2 litres into

357
00:14:30,549 --> 00:14:38,049
that space but the wet spray you might

358
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:40,270
you know put 50 gallons into that or 30

359
00:14:38,049 --> 00:14:42,370
gallons into that same space you know

360
00:14:40,269 --> 00:14:44,259
that amount of moisture is actually

361
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:48,820
generally more detrimental it can you

362
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:51,509
know cause more humidity issues then

363
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:53,320
then say the the low volume application

364
00:14:51,509 --> 00:14:55,450
that makes sense so you're actually

365
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:57,550
having less of an effect on humidity

366
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:58,900
than a spray we haven't put out more

367
00:14:57,549 --> 00:14:59,409
liquid that I get what you're saying

368
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:01,600
there

369
00:14:59,409 --> 00:15:03,399
so overall generally that's the case

370
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:07,000
yeah before I forget you mentioned

371
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:08,199
surfactants for organic growers or

372
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,669
gardeners do you have any

373
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,680
recommendations for favorites that

374
00:15:09,669 --> 00:15:15,189
you've seen just over the years that

375
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:17,500
people are using I don't typically

376
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:19,630
there's a lot fewer than most of the

377
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:23,169
ones that are organically approved are

378
00:15:19,629 --> 00:15:24,939
going to be yucca based extracts almost

379
00:15:23,169 --> 00:15:27,338
all of them are SAP and in Vince

380
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:32,050
versions so happening is a chemistry

381
00:15:27,339 --> 00:15:35,140
chemical in in certain plants that

382
00:15:32,049 --> 00:15:35,909
basically is it's almost it's a it's a

383
00:15:35,139 --> 00:15:41,159
loose

384
00:15:35,909 --> 00:15:42,539
and based surfactant Sappington is is an

385
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:45,919
active ingredient and a number of

386
00:15:42,539 --> 00:15:45,919
different organically registered

387
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:53,430
products so that you could use you know

388
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:56,670
that are applicable for organic

389
00:15:53,429 --> 00:15:58,829
production as far as specific brands

390
00:15:56,669 --> 00:16:00,000
there's there's not any of them that I

391
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:01,290
would definitely recommend necessarily

392
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,669
recommend over another because they're

393
00:16:01,289 --> 00:16:04,679
all fairly similar in the way that they

394
00:16:02,669 --> 00:16:06,059
work they're normally yucca based but

395
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:08,339
there aren't some other basis of Sapa

396
00:16:06,059 --> 00:16:11,369
and that you can you can get generally

397
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:12,750
those tend to work pretty well we

398
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:15,149
actually there's a couple that we've

399
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:17,730
done some tests with with regard

400
00:16:15,149 --> 00:16:20,250
specifically to one piece of equipment

401
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:24,649
we make you know I mentioned the the

402
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:27,000
ultra low volume range we really create

403
00:16:24,649 --> 00:16:29,730
droplets in very different ways so we

404
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:34,139
have you know we have different methods

405
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:37,110
to make smaller droplets we can use high

406
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:40,889
pressure hydrogen hydrostatic pumps we

407
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:43,680
can use aerosol generation systems so

408
00:16:40,889 --> 00:16:46,139
basically we're using air in a very

409
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:48,149
precise manner to chop the droplets up

410
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:50,850
here the droplets and spread and then

411
00:16:48,149 --> 00:16:53,250
apply them we also have volume based air

412
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:55,790
systems where we use high velocity

413
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:59,070
volumes of air to shatter the droplets

414
00:16:55,789 --> 00:17:00,929
those ladder systems tend to be a little

415
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:03,629
bit more sloppy in the way that they

416
00:17:00,929 --> 00:17:05,639
create a droplet they're not as accurate

417
00:17:03,629 --> 00:17:08,039
as far as how evenly they'll they'll

418
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,360
break up the droplets in those cases we

419
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:12,180
typically require some type of

420
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:14,669
surfactant to help with that process so

421
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:18,090
that we want to make so in non non

422
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:21,870
organic agriculture we are using a

423
00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:23,309
product of our own design but it's not

424
00:17:21,869 --> 00:17:25,109
Omri to prove it's not it's not

425
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:29,129
organically approvable it's basically

426
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:31,019
it's a salt based product in those

427
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:33,060
instances we can use some of this happen

428
00:17:31,019 --> 00:17:35,400
in based products to help that machine

429
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:37,500
do its job basically reduce the surface

430
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,810
tension of the water so that as we

431
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:42,420
shatter it with that velocity and volume

432
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:44,399
of air we're able to shatter the

433
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:46,170
droplets more evenly and get a much

434
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,250
better result as far as distribution

435
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:51,950
through the through the facility so

436
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:53,809
as someone who is a grower gardener that

437
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:57,289
has a greenhouse or an indoor garden

438
00:17:53,809 --> 00:17:59,869
where they're cultivating what sort of

439
00:17:57,289 --> 00:18:01,759
like practical considerations in terms

440
00:17:59,869 --> 00:18:03,529
of actual sprayers would you recommend

441
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:06,470
for them to have on hand in a given

442
00:18:03,529 --> 00:18:08,750
situation like this like you mentioned

443
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:11,720
having a way of applying to the entire

444
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:13,430
space which seems really important what

445
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:16,430
they also need to have one for targeted

446
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:18,170
spraying and what what if you could

447
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:23,240
recommend specific sprayers I think that

448
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:25,450
would be useful too okay well as I said

449
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:29,210
before you know the low volume stuff is

450
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:31,000
a great time-saver great labor saver

451
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:33,680
generally does a really good job of

452
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,200
applying pesticides but it's not always

453
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:37,490
applicable so what when when we look at

454
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,440
someone say you're just starting out

455
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:40,870
looking for a new piece of equipment and

456
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:44,360
you need your you know you've got a

457
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:47,509
greenhouse area but you want to spray we

458
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:51,469
generally start with a good hydraulic

459
00:18:47,509 --> 00:18:54,470
sprayer we like to see machines run up

460
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:56,779
to at least 500 psi we make a number of

461
00:18:54,470 --> 00:19:00,799
machines our Hydra and our MSO line both

462
00:18:56,779 --> 00:19:02,539
run up to 500 psi and then we like to

463
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:03,379
make sure that one of the things we see

464
00:19:02,539 --> 00:19:04,849
in greenhouses

465
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:06,980
quite often and someone might have a

466
00:19:04,849 --> 00:19:10,099
machine capable of 500 psi but they turn

467
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:11,509
it up to 250 or 300 the machines are

468
00:19:10,099 --> 00:19:13,669
meant to work at higher pressures and

469
00:19:11,509 --> 00:19:16,309
there's a reason why you may want to

470
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:18,289
reduce pressure for business for some

471
00:19:16,309 --> 00:19:21,889
specific applications but for the most

472
00:19:18,289 --> 00:19:25,099
part if you're trying to apply a

473
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:27,530
pesticide a fungicide to the plant and

474
00:19:25,099 --> 00:19:30,559
you're not worried about things like

475
00:19:27,529 --> 00:19:32,359
drifting on to the next crop or you know

476
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,950
you're generally not going to damage the

477
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:35,419
plant by increasing the pressure because

478
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:36,950
the nozzles generally taking care of

479
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:40,190
that by helping you manufacture a

480
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:42,200
smaller droplet of course if you've got

481
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:43,009
a nozzle that's putting out two plus

482
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:46,759
gallons a minute

483
00:19:43,009 --> 00:19:49,190
higher pressure can be a problem but

484
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:52,670
nozzles that are meant for fine

485
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:54,529
application which anything that we would

486
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:58,550
sell would would come standard ly with

487
00:19:54,529 --> 00:20:00,829
that the higher the pressure generally

488
00:19:58,549 --> 00:20:03,319
means the the finer the droplets we're

489
00:20:00,829 --> 00:20:06,710
going to create plus we also get

490
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:08,319
the added benefit of more force so you

491
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:11,269
know when we're trying to apply

492
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:13,819
pesticides to a plant a lot of the

493
00:20:11,269 --> 00:20:16,009
things we're trying to target aren't

494
00:20:13,819 --> 00:20:19,279
sitting on the outside of the leaves and

495
00:20:16,009 --> 00:20:20,779
they're sitting at the top of the papal

496
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:23,210
growth or inhales they're not I mean

497
00:20:20,779 --> 00:20:25,220
easy spot to get there generally hiding

498
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:26,900
inside the plant and they do that

499
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:29,210
because it's the safest place for them

500
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:30,800
so if we want to get whitefly or spider

501
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:33,289
mite or somebody that's up underneath we

502
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:35,000
want to target mildew or botrytis at the

503
00:20:33,289 --> 00:20:37,369
stem or things that we have to you know

504
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,500
really get into the canopy droplets

505
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:40,729
gonna help but also some force you need

506
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:45,619
something to actually propel that

507
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:46,849
product into the crop and so when you

508
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:50,209
have a higher pressure it's actually

509
00:20:46,849 --> 00:20:52,189
giving you a little bit more force to to

510
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:55,220
push that spray in the plant now we

511
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:56,539
don't want force like a pressure washer

512
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:59,269
force we don't want something that's

513
00:20:56,539 --> 00:21:01,460
very hard straight stream we want force

514
00:20:59,269 --> 00:21:05,000
with very fine droplets so you end up

515
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:08,000
with a very swirling spray you end up

516
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:11,150
with very diffuse droplets that the

517
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,309
force is there but it rapidly dissipates

518
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:16,910
when it encounters other forces like a

519
00:21:13,309 --> 00:21:19,399
plant it'll hit that plan and spread as

520
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:22,160
opposed to you know battering the plant

521
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:25,670
so a combination there you're looking at

522
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:26,540
particle size and pressure you want to

523
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:30,080
always make sure you have the right

524
00:21:26,539 --> 00:21:32,089
nozzle in married to that so we'd start

525
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:34,699
with something that's a good up to 500

526
00:21:32,089 --> 00:21:36,289
psi sprayer but as I said there's times

527
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:38,120
when you may want to reduce that

528
00:21:36,289 --> 00:21:39,230
pressure so variable pressure is

529
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:40,819
important when you're looking at a

530
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:42,829
sprayer you want to make sure you can

531
00:21:40,819 --> 00:21:44,960
turn down the pressure because sometimes

532
00:21:42,829 --> 00:21:46,399
you may want to spray just a little

533
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,140
section and you don't want it drifting

534
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,580
on something else there's plenty of

535
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:52,280
different products that we use

536
00:21:49,579 --> 00:21:54,859
commercially plant growth regulators

537
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:57,170
where I want that on a specific set of

538
00:21:54,859 --> 00:21:59,359
plants and I don't want it drifting all

539
00:21:57,170 --> 00:22:02,269
over the place there's some times when I

540
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:06,019
might need to springe the soil or just

541
00:22:02,269 --> 00:22:07,460
get the soil slightly moist and fine

542
00:22:06,019 --> 00:22:08,930
droplets don't help me with that you

543
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:10,910
know I need a little bit coarser of a

544
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:13,460
droplet so it'll actually impact the

545
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:15,620
soil and and and soak in a little bit so

546
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:16,909
pressure can you know altering your

547
00:22:15,619 --> 00:22:20,538
pressure can help

548
00:22:16,909 --> 00:22:23,359
with that so variability is important we

549
00:22:20,538 --> 00:22:24,679
look at Venn things like you know that

550
00:22:23,358 --> 00:22:26,449
the next thing that I would suggest

551
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:28,999
that's probably the next most important

552
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:33,229
besides a good solid pressurized system

553
00:22:28,999 --> 00:22:36,348
is usability and ease of use you're

554
00:22:33,229 --> 00:22:39,109
gonna go and spray a greenhouse and take

555
00:22:36,348 --> 00:22:40,579
time doing it it's not a real fun job I

556
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:41,808
don't think there's a lot of people

557
00:22:40,579 --> 00:22:44,839
would say that's something that they

558
00:22:41,808 --> 00:22:48,348
really enjoy doing it's a job that's a

559
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:52,638
necessary thing but it's not anybody's

560
00:22:48,348 --> 00:22:55,249
favorite job and so our beliefs as a

561
00:22:52,638 --> 00:22:57,738
company is we want to make it as easy as

562
00:22:55,249 --> 00:23:00,798
possible for the applicator the harder

563
00:22:57,739 --> 00:23:03,200
it gets for the applicator the worst job

564
00:23:00,798 --> 00:23:04,729
they do in our opinion they're

565
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,048
uncomfortable they've got to run back to

566
00:23:04,729 --> 00:23:07,989
the machine because a hose keeps getting

567
00:23:06,048 --> 00:23:10,460
caught and pinched against the side wall

568
00:23:07,989 --> 00:23:12,769
the thing is a real bear to move around

569
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:15,229
you know 50 gallons we've got a lot of

570
00:23:12,769 --> 00:23:17,569
machines that are fifty hundred even 200

571
00:23:15,229 --> 00:23:20,090
allen sprayers someone has to move that

572
00:23:17,569 --> 00:23:23,989
it better be very very easy to maneuver

573
00:23:20,089 --> 00:23:27,558
because 50 gallons is 200 pounds so

574
00:23:23,989 --> 00:23:30,379
moving that you know it's important to

575
00:23:27,558 --> 00:23:32,989
make sure that that it's designed well

576
00:23:30,378 --> 00:23:34,819
to be able to maneuver you've selected

577
00:23:32,989 --> 00:23:36,139
the right wheels for the type of surface

578
00:23:34,819 --> 00:23:38,269
you're going to be covering with it

579
00:23:36,138 --> 00:23:40,579
you've got the right kind of reel that

580
00:23:38,269 --> 00:23:42,888
doesn't create a pinch point so you're

581
00:23:40,579 --> 00:23:44,269
20 feet out and the hose gets pinched up

582
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:46,459
against a side wall and you got to run

583
00:23:44,269 --> 00:23:49,429
back to the machine to undo it

584
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:51,048
you want to look for guns that have that

585
00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:52,609
are comfortable to hold when you're

586
00:23:51,048 --> 00:23:54,168
pulling the trigger there's some guns

587
00:23:52,608 --> 00:23:57,589
that are out there where you basically

588
00:23:54,169 --> 00:23:59,659
you know they're like an exercise what

589
00:23:57,589 --> 00:24:02,178
like one of those spring Z that they

590
00:23:59,659 --> 00:24:04,039
used to have in the eighties for you

591
00:24:02,179 --> 00:24:06,409
know building up your forearms and your

592
00:24:04,038 --> 00:24:07,970
grip that there it's got a very tight

593
00:24:06,409 --> 00:24:10,009
spring and so when you pull the trigger

594
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:11,450
they they're there's a lot of force

595
00:24:10,009 --> 00:24:12,979
involved you want to find things that

596
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,929
are more comfortable to use because if

597
00:24:12,979 --> 00:24:17,179
you're not comfortable doing the job and

598
00:24:14,929 --> 00:24:20,479
you're constantly having to deal with

599
00:24:17,179 --> 00:24:23,479
issues around the equipment generally

600
00:24:20,479 --> 00:24:28,359
the job suffers it's our opinion so we

601
00:24:23,479 --> 00:24:28,359
spend a lot of our time designing for

602
00:24:28,538 --> 00:24:33,019
designing for

603
00:24:29,929 --> 00:24:34,490
of use and comfort so when we look at

604
00:24:33,019 --> 00:24:35,990
hydraulic sprayers any of our equipment

605
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:37,339
is going to fit into those types of

606
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:38,808
things we want to make sure that they're

607
00:24:37,339 --> 00:24:43,158
easy to use we want to make sure they've

608
00:24:38,808 --> 00:24:45,200
got they've got a good a good range of

609
00:24:43,159 --> 00:24:46,909
pressure but also that they can get up

610
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:50,269
to about 500 psi to create a fine

611
00:24:46,909 --> 00:24:51,259
droplet and then beyond that you know as

612
00:24:50,269 --> 00:24:52,278
long as those types of things are

613
00:24:51,259 --> 00:24:55,610
covered I think you're gonna you're

614
00:24:52,278 --> 00:24:56,990
going to start out just great from there

615
00:24:55,609 --> 00:24:58,729
that's when we start to talk to people

616
00:24:56,990 --> 00:25:01,038
about maybe you want to think about a

617
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:02,720
little volume machine to cut some of the

618
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:05,210
time that you're putting into this but

619
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:07,490
if you're starting out a good hydraulic

620
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:09,919
sprayer is the best place to start okay

621
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:11,210
and that kind of robbing my next

622
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:12,980
question because the moment you said

623
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:16,009
smaller droplets I immediately thought

624
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:19,159
of compost tea applications or microbial

625
00:25:16,009 --> 00:25:21,558
based applications where in my

626
00:25:19,159 --> 00:25:23,330
experience a smaller droplet can

627
00:25:21,558 --> 00:25:25,480
sometimes an higher force can lead to

628
00:25:23,329 --> 00:25:28,308
actually being quite damaging to

629
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:30,769
microbial life can you touch a little

630
00:25:28,308 --> 00:25:33,859
bit on options in that regard and your

631
00:25:30,769 --> 00:25:35,929
experiences and what you're finding to

632
00:25:33,859 --> 00:25:37,158
an extent that can be indication it

633
00:25:35,929 --> 00:25:41,929
depends on the manufacturers

634
00:25:37,159 --> 00:25:43,909
recommendations there are certainly some

635
00:25:41,929 --> 00:25:45,710
products whether they're compost teas or

636
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:48,350
microbial products where you are

637
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:50,090
applying say an antenna Pathak fungi

638
00:25:48,349 --> 00:25:52,849
that's going to parasitize a white fly

639
00:25:50,089 --> 00:25:57,558
or do you want to be aware of the

640
00:25:52,849 --> 00:26:00,648
limitations of those those microbes I

641
00:25:57,558 --> 00:26:04,308
know that certain pressures can cause

642
00:26:00,648 --> 00:26:05,569
damage and so you have to be very well

643
00:26:04,308 --> 00:26:07,190
aware that other things that are going

644
00:26:05,569 --> 00:26:09,378
to impact those applications is

645
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:11,690
filtration you know every one of the

646
00:26:09,378 --> 00:26:13,128
sprayers we make has filters in them and

647
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:14,778
it's and that's done to protect the

648
00:26:13,128 --> 00:26:16,939
system protect the nozzle protect the

649
00:26:14,778 --> 00:26:21,528
investment the person you know has put

650
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:23,058
into that machine but the most of the

651
00:26:21,528 --> 00:26:24,528
time we look at that as that's one

652
00:26:23,058 --> 00:26:26,509
application and we need to how do we

653
00:26:24,528 --> 00:26:27,888
modify things to to make that

654
00:26:26,509 --> 00:26:30,259
application it's not going to be every

655
00:26:27,888 --> 00:26:31,998
application so we work very closely with

656
00:26:30,259 --> 00:26:34,639
a lot of manufacturers of those products

657
00:26:31,999 --> 00:26:37,038
and we're very familiar with so if we're

658
00:26:34,638 --> 00:26:39,439
going to apply you know a Bavaria basi

659
00:26:37,038 --> 00:26:41,298
on a product we're very familiar with

660
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,340
the limitations of that you know it for

661
00:26:41,298 --> 00:26:43,940
the most part pressure is not a big

662
00:26:43,339 --> 00:26:47,240
issue for some

663
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:49,669
like that but he is and so that you know

664
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:51,230
that that one of those ultra low volume

665
00:26:49,669 --> 00:26:54,679
machines that we make is actually a

666
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:56,899
small jet engine and there is heat that

667
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:59,360
results so we've we've actually

668
00:26:56,898 --> 00:27:03,138
developed a specific version of that

669
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:04,849
machine which cools the exhaust so that

670
00:27:03,138 --> 00:27:07,158
we don't have issues and we can't apply

671
00:27:04,849 --> 00:27:08,778
those types of products we work very

672
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:10,070
hard at making sure that we understand

673
00:27:08,778 --> 00:27:12,888
our equipment and relationship

674
00:27:10,069 --> 00:27:16,638
biological applications and for the most

675
00:27:12,888 --> 00:27:18,619
part we can use any of them without any

676
00:27:16,638 --> 00:27:20,089
real concerns sometimes like I said you

677
00:27:18,619 --> 00:27:22,308
might need make a modification you're

678
00:27:20,089 --> 00:27:23,990
gonna buy something that we don't want

679
00:27:22,308 --> 00:27:25,970
to filter out all the good stuff you

680
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:27,919
know so we need to make sure that we

681
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:30,079
sometimes remove the filter but then

682
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:32,330
there's the person you know that's

683
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:33,740
that's with the caveat that you you take

684
00:27:32,329 --> 00:27:35,928
that filter out you better make sure you

685
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:41,450
really rinse the machine and flush it

686
00:27:35,929 --> 00:27:43,190
well before you put it away if you're

687
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:44,840
going to use a heat sensitive product

688
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:48,019
making sure you've got the correct

689
00:27:44,839 --> 00:27:50,990
machine to do that job and our team is

690
00:27:48,019 --> 00:27:53,870
very well-versed in those types of of

691
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:56,378
issues we're good at working there's a

692
00:27:53,869 --> 00:28:00,109
lot of violence occasion even

693
00:27:56,378 --> 00:28:01,579
non-organic horticulture

694
00:28:00,109 --> 00:28:03,408
there's a lot of those are just very

695
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:04,939
very good products to use they're you

696
00:28:03,409 --> 00:28:07,309
know they're safer environmentally they

697
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:08,600
are they have a totally different mode

698
00:28:07,308 --> 00:28:11,058
of action than a lot of the other

699
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:12,619
pesticides that are available and it's

700
00:28:11,058 --> 00:28:14,869
great to shake that stuff up even if

701
00:28:12,619 --> 00:28:16,069
you're a conventional growers so the

702
00:28:14,869 --> 00:28:18,319
majority of our customers are using

703
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:21,319
those types of products already very

704
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:25,339
regular regularly that's good to hear I

705
00:28:21,319 --> 00:28:27,019
my experience with it is that I using a

706
00:28:25,339 --> 00:28:29,750
microscope we would check the product

707
00:28:27,019 --> 00:28:31,399
for activity like a compost tea for

708
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:32,929
example and then we would send it

709
00:28:31,398 --> 00:28:35,268
through the sprayer and look at it on

710
00:28:32,929 --> 00:28:37,038
the other end and I know this is just a

711
00:28:35,269 --> 00:28:38,929
one-off thing I looked at an atomizer

712
00:28:37,038 --> 00:28:41,000
someone had a hydro shop once and even

713
00:28:38,929 --> 00:28:42,620
the bacteria the motile bacteria was

714
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,388
killed off by going through this

715
00:28:42,619 --> 00:28:45,739
atomizer now you mentioned heat that

716
00:28:44,388 --> 00:28:48,949
might have been a factor I don't know I

717
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:51,919
assumed it was the the particle side the

718
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:56,269
droplet size or something inside there

719
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:57,830
it can be both yeah sure it can be maybe

720
00:28:56,269 --> 00:29:00,019
not even a droplet size but sometime

721
00:28:57,829 --> 00:29:03,528
it can be just the actual application or

722
00:29:00,019 --> 00:29:05,419
the the process of making the droplet so

723
00:29:03,528 --> 00:29:08,000
the droplet might be fairly large but

724
00:29:05,419 --> 00:29:10,820
but the forces involved in doing that

725
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,130
might cause some damage to something as

726
00:29:10,819 --> 00:29:15,950
you said the best way to do to test that

727
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:18,260
stuff is to actually run a test and see

728
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:20,558
what what comes out the other end and so

729
00:29:18,259 --> 00:29:23,390
with most of the commercially available

730
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:24,918
product in the horticultural industry

731
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:26,750
we've actually done that work we work

732
00:29:24,919 --> 00:29:29,419
with the manufacturers of those products

733
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:32,659
to get approval with any of those

734
00:29:29,419 --> 00:29:34,340
products we we had one of the chemical

735
00:29:32,659 --> 00:29:37,220
manufacturers actually is a biological

736
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:39,769
manufacturer a number of years ago you

737
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:42,019
know always basically said we always

738
00:29:39,769 --> 00:29:43,940
need to keep keep together we always

739
00:29:42,019 --> 00:29:45,440
need to work together because they make

740
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:47,778
the bullets we make the guns you want to

741
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,548
make sure they fit we want to make sure

742
00:29:47,778 --> 00:29:52,579
that our stuff works with their stuff

743
00:29:49,548 --> 00:29:53,990
and vice versa so we have a very close

744
00:29:52,579 --> 00:29:56,178
relationship with the various

745
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:58,880
manufacturers in the industry and and

746
00:29:56,179 --> 00:30:00,320
anytime something new comes out we're

747
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,630
really good about making sure that it

748
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:04,158
gets tested and and that we understand

749
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:07,669
how to use those products in our

750
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:09,830
equipment okay so a grower could contact

751
00:30:07,669 --> 00:30:11,690
DRAM and find out from them exactly what

752
00:30:09,829 --> 00:30:13,879
sprayer would work best for the types of

753
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:15,230
products that they're applying in their

754
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:17,539
green house or in their indoor

755
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:20,538
environment essentially definitely yeah

756
00:30:17,538 --> 00:30:24,288
right that's great to hear and along

757
00:30:20,538 --> 00:30:26,359
those lines I yesterday was out in a

758
00:30:24,288 --> 00:30:27,710
facility they have a 500 gallon compost

759
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:30,859
tea Brewer that they're then sending

760
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:33,409
through a dosatron out into okay these

761
00:30:30,859 --> 00:30:34,668
brooms and I haven't I told them how I

762
00:30:33,409 --> 00:30:36,230
would test it you know similar to what

763
00:30:34,669 --> 00:30:38,200
we just discussed using a microscope

764
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:40,339
look at the tea before look at it after

765
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:42,169
have you do you how do you have any

766
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:45,019
results relating to dosatrons and how

767
00:30:42,169 --> 00:30:46,639
they affect microbial life though well

768
00:30:45,019 --> 00:30:47,960
when it comes to specifically a compost

769
00:30:46,638 --> 00:30:49,548
tea it's it's hard to know because

770
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:53,899
there's there can be such a wide range

771
00:30:49,548 --> 00:30:55,638
of constituent microflora in in what

772
00:30:53,898 --> 00:30:58,038
you're trying to apply there when it

773
00:30:55,638 --> 00:30:59,509
comes to commercially available products

774
00:30:58,038 --> 00:31:01,759
I don't think there's any issues at all

775
00:30:59,509 --> 00:31:05,058
from what we've seen the design of a

776
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:07,429
piston in that you you know basically

777
00:31:05,058 --> 00:31:09,558
the way that those work you have water

778
00:31:07,429 --> 00:31:11,690
runs through the drives of piston up and

779
00:31:09,558 --> 00:31:14,028
down the majority of

780
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:17,750
but you might get some issues against

781
00:31:14,028 --> 00:31:19,308
the sidewall of the of the chamber but I

782
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:22,548
would think that you wouldn't get very

783
00:31:19,308 --> 00:31:24,349
much damage at all especially given the

784
00:31:22,548 --> 00:31:26,298
type of pop you know the size of the

785
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:28,128
population you'd be trying to apply so I

786
00:31:26,298 --> 00:31:31,548
would think that an injector generally

787
00:31:28,128 --> 00:31:33,589
would be a very fairly safe method or a

788
00:31:31,548 --> 00:31:35,929
piston based injector like a dosatron

789
00:31:33,589 --> 00:31:38,509
okay just because there you know you're

790
00:31:35,929 --> 00:31:42,230
basically siphoning liquid out of a tank

791
00:31:38,509 --> 00:31:43,339
and you know with one pull on the piston

792
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:46,250
and you're pushing it out

793
00:31:43,339 --> 00:31:49,490
with the with the with this river stroke

794
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:51,740
so you've got a large chamber that's

795
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:53,419
being filled each time so I wouldn't

796
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:54,859
think there'd be a bunch of an issue the

797
00:31:53,419 --> 00:31:57,190
only thing that I could see being an

798
00:31:54,859 --> 00:32:00,408
issue is that dosatron has a filter on

799
00:31:57,190 --> 00:32:02,750
the intake of the solution line and so

800
00:32:00,409 --> 00:32:07,039
you may need to depending on you know

801
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:08,929
how big the the microbial product is you

802
00:32:07,038 --> 00:32:10,878
know the different little bugs you're

803
00:32:08,929 --> 00:32:12,980
trying to pull through that machine are

804
00:32:10,878 --> 00:32:14,839
they're filter might be trapping and

805
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:17,269
filtering some of them out so you might

806
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:18,740
need to look at what the filter does but

807
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:21,169
I would say the actual mechanics

808
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:23,169
wouldn't probably be an issue okay well

809
00:32:21,169 --> 00:32:25,549
that's good to know I appreciate that

810
00:32:23,169 --> 00:32:27,259
along those lines and then we started

811
00:32:25,548 --> 00:32:31,609
talking about microbes here I recently

812
00:32:27,259 --> 00:32:32,929
was sent a test result from a buddy of

813
00:32:31,609 --> 00:32:36,500
mine he's a golf course superintendent

814
00:32:32,929 --> 00:32:39,048
and he had started looking at water

815
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:41,058
quality specifically chlorine and how it

816
00:32:39,048 --> 00:32:45,079
affects microbial based products and it

817
00:32:41,058 --> 00:32:47,329
was pretty sure a pretty big die-off

818
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:48,138
associated with adding chlorine to a

819
00:32:47,329 --> 00:32:50,298
finished

820
00:32:48,138 --> 00:32:52,898
you know microbial product or compost

821
00:32:50,298 --> 00:32:55,398
tea do you have anything that any

822
00:32:52,898 --> 00:32:59,058
anything you would add along those lines

823
00:32:55,398 --> 00:33:01,428
or any experiences yourself with that so

824
00:32:59,058 --> 00:33:02,690
one of our businesses we have a segment

825
00:33:01,429 --> 00:33:04,490
of our business called REM water and

826
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:07,070
what we do in that that segment of our

827
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:08,599
business is water treatment we manage

828
00:33:07,069 --> 00:33:10,250
you know basically we do water

829
00:33:08,599 --> 00:33:12,709
management we move water we pump water

830
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:15,980
we store water we use it for irrigation

831
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:18,798
we develop irrigation system but we also

832
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:21,259
do disinfection of water we do

833
00:33:18,798 --> 00:33:24,079
filtration of water we don't use

834
00:33:21,259 --> 00:33:26,539
chlorine as a disinfectant and main

835
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:28,039
reason we don't like

836
00:33:26,539 --> 00:33:31,279
well one we feel that there's there's

837
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:32,960
more effective disinfectants for some of

838
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:35,960
the things we're trying to do but at the

839
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:38,420
same time chlorine is really not a plant

840
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:41,210
friendly product but it's certainly not

841
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:43,000
a microbial friendly product in the

842
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:46,579
entire the entire point of putting

843
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:48,679
chlorine into your pool is to prevent

844
00:33:46,579 --> 00:33:51,109
the spread of pathogens in that pool I

845
00:33:48,679 --> 00:33:53,450
don't want somebody to get in there all

846
00:33:51,109 --> 00:33:55,250
journey and have those little germs to

847
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:57,890
learn and get somebody else the whole

848
00:33:55,250 --> 00:34:00,200
point of that is to kill those so that

849
00:33:57,890 --> 00:34:03,290
what you're stating as far as you know

850
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:06,529
the tests that they did that that

851
00:34:03,289 --> 00:34:09,199
completely makes sense so no I would

852
00:34:06,529 --> 00:34:10,550
generally not use chlorine as or if

853
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:12,769
you're gonna use chlorinated water to

854
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:14,330
let it dance off for a bit a little bit

855
00:34:12,769 --> 00:34:16,780
agitation and you'll gas off a lot of

856
00:34:14,329 --> 00:34:18,949
the chlorine in a period of time

857
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:21,379
otherwise you could use things like

858
00:34:18,949 --> 00:34:23,809
carbon filters and stuff to remove the

859
00:34:21,378 --> 00:34:25,398
you know the remove the chlorine if

860
00:34:23,809 --> 00:34:28,128
you're going to be using like city water

861
00:34:25,398 --> 00:34:31,429
and you're concerned about I certainly

862
00:34:28,128 --> 00:34:36,259
wouldn't add it we use as a disinfectant

863
00:34:31,429 --> 00:34:37,429
we use ozone which is from the air we

864
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:39,560
breathe we basically stripped the

865
00:34:37,429 --> 00:34:41,358
nitrogen out we concentrate the oxygen

866
00:34:39,559 --> 00:34:43,789
and we run it through a generation

867
00:34:41,358 --> 00:34:45,679
system that basically is like lightning

868
00:34:43,789 --> 00:34:50,000
in a bottle it splits up some of those o

869
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:53,119
2 molecules and repairs them with other

870
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,190
o2 molecules making o3 it's a very

871
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:57,260
reactive product which is why we like it

872
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:59,119
it's very good at the you know

873
00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:01,160
eliminating biofilm and things like that

874
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:05,108
it'll nuke anything you know if you if

875
00:35:01,159 --> 00:35:08,059
we took straight very high level

876
00:35:05,108 --> 00:35:10,039
ozonated water and we mixed it

877
00:35:08,059 --> 00:35:13,670
immediately with a bunch of microbes it

878
00:35:10,039 --> 00:35:16,519
would get rid of a lot of them the nice

879
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:18,320
thing about ozone is is so reactive that

880
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:19,699
typically it tends to you know in an

881
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,740
on-demand environment if I've got

882
00:35:19,699 --> 00:35:23,149
nothing I need to oxidize it's still

883
00:35:21,739 --> 00:35:26,719
only you know I have a half-life of 20

884
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:29,720
minutes so what ends up happening though

885
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:31,009
what's really nice about the ozone

886
00:35:29,719 --> 00:35:33,379
system especially when we're talking

887
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:36,260
about you know using it with microbial

888
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:38,369
products most of the products most of

889
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:40,770
microbes we like

890
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:42,900
to the aerobic most of the microbes we

891
00:35:40,769 --> 00:35:47,420
don't like for plant growth tend to be

892
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:51,840
anaerobic the one of the real big

893
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:56,159
advantages of an ozone system for plant

894
00:35:51,840 --> 00:36:00,690
growth is that when when the ozone goes

895
00:35:56,159 --> 00:36:02,659
away it reverts back to o2 basically one

896
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:06,389
of those Oh

897
00:36:02,659 --> 00:36:09,569
oxygen molecules on a no.3 molecule

898
00:36:06,389 --> 00:36:12,690
split off oxidizing something leaving o

899
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:14,760
to that o2 is still dissolved in the

900
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:16,019
water so the advantage is we can

901
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:18,060
actually have very high levels of

902
00:36:16,019 --> 00:36:20,849
dissolved oxygen and now we've actually

903
00:36:18,059 --> 00:36:22,949
done some tests using highly ozonated

904
00:36:20,849 --> 00:36:25,489
water that had been run through a system

905
00:36:22,949 --> 00:36:27,539
so the ozone is basically being used up

906
00:36:25,489 --> 00:36:29,729
ending up with very high levels of

907
00:36:27,539 --> 00:36:33,650
dissolved oxygen generally you know when

908
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:36,809
we in our tests in the 20 to 25 ppm

909
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:39,030
levels of dissolved oxygen which is at

910
00:36:36,809 --> 00:36:40,259
that point with the temperature water we

911
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:42,590
were using was actually above the

912
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:45,030
saturation level saturation was about 11

913
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:48,360
we can put that in because ozone is much

914
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:49,800
more soluble in water than o2 is so we

915
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:52,860
get it into solution stays in solution

916
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:55,140
much like carbonization you know carbon

917
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:58,110
dioxide does in a canno soda you know

918
00:36:55,139 --> 00:37:01,440
you have a pressurized canister that's

919
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:04,140
full of supersaturated gas in a liquid

920
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:06,090
you open it up the pressure pressure is

921
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:08,339
relieved it starts that for vests and

922
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:09,960
says that's what's happening in this

923
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:11,610
case but it takes it doesn't happen in

924
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:13,199
two minutes it happens in about 20

925
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:16,050
minutes it takes a while for you can a

926
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:18,059
can of coke to go flat same thing here

927
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:21,990
we've supersaturated the liquid for the

928
00:37:18,059 --> 00:37:24,570
water with oxygen and then we are able

929
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:27,299
to keep that in solution so we've done

930
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:31,559
some trials with specifically Burberry

931
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:33,690
of Asiana where we saw as well as some

932
00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:35,969
Trichoderma products where we saw better

933
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:38,450
colonization as a result of using highly

934
00:37:35,969 --> 00:37:40,819
oxygen and water from the ozone process

935
00:37:38,449 --> 00:37:43,409
mainly because we're providing them with

936
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:45,780
an environment that allows them to

937
00:37:43,409 --> 00:37:47,819
thrive a lot of oxygen in the water yeah

938
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:49,740
that makes a lot of sense but that does

939
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:51,720
it there's a roundabout way to answering

940
00:37:49,739 --> 00:37:54,149
your question about chlorine in in

941
00:37:51,719 --> 00:37:55,759
Spray solutions meeting microbes but

942
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:58,559
yeah I would I would say that that

943
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,970
chlorines probably not a good tool to be

944
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:02,009
using in in that type of that

945
00:37:59,969 --> 00:38:05,848
application not a bad way to clean up

946
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:08,070
afterwards but you know say you want to

947
00:38:05,849 --> 00:38:10,559
or you get something in the tank that

948
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:12,660
maybe shouldn't been in there I've seen

949
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:15,269
it happen where we're a compost tea

950
00:38:12,659 --> 00:38:17,489
system something that we didn't really

951
00:38:15,269 --> 00:38:21,539
want the compost wasn't very good or

952
00:38:17,489 --> 00:38:23,339
there's a bad source and it was too

953
00:38:21,539 --> 00:38:25,949
cerium or something in in there that

954
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:27,809
could be bred as well so you know

955
00:38:25,949 --> 00:38:30,750
chlorine would be a good tool to help

956
00:38:27,809 --> 00:38:34,559
clean about afterwards yeah now you

957
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:35,670
touched on biofilm briefly is that

958
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:37,320
something you can talk about a little

959
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:39,059
bit more in terms of maintenance and

960
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:42,240
care and sprayers and irrigation lines

961
00:38:39,059 --> 00:38:44,190
and such things like that that's

962
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:46,739
actually a very big part of what we do

963
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:53,010
for me from water treatment standpoint

964
00:38:46,739 --> 00:38:54,929
biofilm is a big part of any irrigation

965
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:58,109
system you're gonna find biofilm I mean

966
00:38:54,929 --> 00:39:01,919
you find in any water system at all what

967
00:38:58,108 --> 00:39:03,358
we hose own because it's so reactive is

968
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:07,619
actually a very good tool to eliminate

969
00:39:03,358 --> 00:39:09,329
biofilm it generally isn't going to

970
00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:11,070
slough it off one of the times one of

971
00:39:09,329 --> 00:39:14,400
the things we see with other biofilm or

972
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:18,510
you know radicans is that they'll loosen

973
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:21,630
chunks and send it downstream where as

974
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:23,490
ozone tends to react very quickly and

975
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:26,130
then it stops because it's that you've

976
00:39:23,489 --> 00:39:27,329
used you've used the ozone so what it

977
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:29,880
ends up doing instead of weakening the

978
00:39:27,329 --> 00:39:32,969
bond to the pipe it ends up kind of

979
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:35,220
burning up the ozone or the biofilm and

980
00:39:32,969 --> 00:39:36,598
then more ozone comes along and burns up

981
00:39:35,219 --> 00:39:39,539
a little bit more so it basically eats

982
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:43,170
its way down the pipe without really

983
00:39:39,539 --> 00:39:45,989
removing it in big you know snake skins

984
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:49,849
worth of algae and biofilm and gunk that

985
00:39:45,989 --> 00:39:54,029
and a clogging stuff so one of the more

986
00:39:49,849 --> 00:39:56,490
effective tools that we've found for for

987
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:58,320
controlling biofilm is ozone just

988
00:39:56,489 --> 00:40:01,679
because it's so reactive it density

989
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:03,630
tends to do a better job so is there a

990
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:05,039
particular device or something like an

991
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:07,530
ozonator that you can put

992
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:09,779
your irrigation or something that you

993
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:11,940
can use to run a tap to fill your

994
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:13,410
sprayer with that water and then run

995
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:15,960
that through your sprayer as a way of

996
00:40:13,409 --> 00:40:17,879
because it sounds like it sounds like a

997
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:19,769
great option to have right on your

998
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:21,510
irrigation to where you just run it

999
00:40:19,769 --> 00:40:23,280
through it takes out the biofilm and you

1000
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:25,470
end up with high dissolved oxygen water

1001
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:27,960
hitting your plants is that am i

1002
00:40:25,469 --> 00:40:30,629
understanding this correctly or that's

1003
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:32,099
exactly that's exactly the what we feel

1004
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:33,780
the benefit is it's cleaning it's

1005
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:36,089
basically doing a lot of cleaning at the

1006
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:38,010
same time it's giving you water that's

1007
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:40,200
healthier than it was before much

1008
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:44,400
healthier for for plant growth as well

1009
00:40:40,199 --> 00:40:46,679
as for beneficial microbes as far as the

1010
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,150
system no it's unfortunately it's not

1011
00:40:46,679 --> 00:40:50,869
really a plug-and-play thing because

1012
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:52,860
there's so much that goes into this

1013
00:40:50,869 --> 00:40:54,659
typically a system like that is gonna be

1014
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:57,860
something we would design for a customer

1015
00:40:54,659 --> 00:41:00,089
we do have some basic sizes of systems

1016
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:01,829
but one of the things we like to look at

1017
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:04,230
right away you know first we have how

1018
00:41:01,829 --> 00:41:07,099
much water you know how much water do we

1019
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:09,630
need to clean secondly we would look at

1020
00:41:07,099 --> 00:41:13,219
what's in the water what do we need to

1021
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:15,690
remove and we do that with filtration or

1022
00:41:13,219 --> 00:41:16,709
disinfection in the water and that's

1023
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:18,059
something that we find that a lot of

1024
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:21,720
people don't they don't always look at

1025
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:25,340
what's in the water to be removed and

1026
00:41:21,719 --> 00:41:30,599
it's important because if I if I base my

1027
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:32,490
disinfection system on flow alone but

1028
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:34,500
I've got really really high loads I'm

1029
00:41:32,489 --> 00:41:35,609
gonna overload the system very quickly

1030
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:38,099
because it's going to be working really

1031
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:40,530
hard to get rid of the very high load

1032
00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:41,610
even if it's not a lot of water so we

1033
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:43,550
need to look at both of those things

1034
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:45,690
anytime that we do a system like that

1035
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:47,280
you know we can come in with some basic

1036
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:49,019
recommendations just by looking at the

1037
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:52,590
water but most of the time we want to do

1038
00:41:49,019 --> 00:41:54,570
a water sample and test the water and

1039
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:56,220
see what's actually there that needs to

1040
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:58,650
be around sometimes it's not you know

1041
00:41:56,219 --> 00:42:02,309
things that sometimes are things that

1042
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:04,440
need other other tools to help remove

1043
00:42:02,309 --> 00:42:05,549
you know so if we're high in salts or

1044
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:07,500
bicarbonate or something like that

1045
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:09,090
ozone is not effective on those types of

1046
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:10,710
things so we would look at other types

1047
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:12,450
of you know whether we're going to

1048
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:15,000
adjust the pH air we're going to use

1049
00:42:12,449 --> 00:42:17,159
something like nano filtration or even

1050
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,840
ro you know we would look at different

1051
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:21,029
things when applicable

1052
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:22,050
you know we don't necessarily advocate

1053
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:24,750
those types of things all the time

1054
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:26,840
because a lot of times water it's you

1055
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:30,269
know the water in a lot of facilities is

1056
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:31,920
great to start out or it might need just

1057
00:42:30,269 --> 00:42:35,400
a little bit of tweaking

1058
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:37,650
sometimes we see growers that think ro

1059
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:42,320
is some special magical water and it's

1060
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:46,889
it's actually what it is h2o it's - its

1061
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:48,240
hydrogen and oxygen only and it has no

1062
00:42:46,889 --> 00:42:51,329
buffering capacity it has nothing else

1063
00:42:48,239 --> 00:42:54,239
whereas most of the water on the planet

1064
00:42:51,329 --> 00:42:55,739
has something else in it water is the

1065
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:57,419
universal solvent so much stuff is

1066
00:42:55,739 --> 00:43:00,119
dissolved in the water around us and

1067
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:02,159
most of that is benign sometimes it's

1068
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:03,210
not so we need to look at you know what

1069
00:43:02,159 --> 00:43:04,710
we're trying to do with it for trying to

1070
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:07,829
grow plants there's some things we want

1071
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:09,539
to you want to adjust yeah was it I

1072
00:43:07,829 --> 00:43:11,279
think it was you I was talking to at the

1073
00:43:09,539 --> 00:43:14,489
bio controls conference that said that

1074
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:18,390
RO water is not the best option for soil

1075
00:43:14,489 --> 00:43:19,849
growers that are growing in soil can you

1076
00:43:18,389 --> 00:43:22,679
expand on that at all

1077
00:43:19,849 --> 00:43:24,739
well yeah basically for some of the

1078
00:43:22,679 --> 00:43:28,230
reasons that I just mentioned the most

1079
00:43:24,739 --> 00:43:30,839
what the the main issue that we find

1080
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:33,300
with RO is that there's really very

1081
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:36,720
little buffering capacity to it so if

1082
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:39,000
I'm growing in you know very commonly a

1083
00:43:36,719 --> 00:43:42,119
soilless media all right so I'm using

1084
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:44,750
something that's fairly inert a Coco

1085
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:47,699
whatever you know what so in rock wall

1086
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:50,010
if I keep putting in water there you

1087
00:43:47,699 --> 00:43:53,279
know we're we're I've adjusted it for

1088
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:55,740
the pH but it's it but it's been

1089
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:59,700
borrowed or I'm using a fertilizer that

1090
00:43:55,739 --> 00:44:01,529
is already is it's that's acidic it's

1091
00:43:59,699 --> 00:44:03,989
gonna start to drop the media pH and

1092
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:06,600
I've got nothing in that water to help

1093
00:44:03,989 --> 00:44:09,299
buffer bicarbonate is actually you know

1094
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:10,619
yes we can have too many but a lot of

1095
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:14,190
times those by governments are helping

1096
00:44:10,619 --> 00:44:17,039
us keep that water fairly stable if we

1097
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:18,389
don't if we're applying things like like

1098
00:44:17,039 --> 00:44:19,829
an acidic fertilizer without those

1099
00:44:18,389 --> 00:44:21,420
bicarbonate Stu help buffer that water

1100
00:44:19,829 --> 00:44:24,719
we're going to start crashing the media

1101
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:26,700
pH and we find that we've seen that in

1102
00:44:24,719 --> 00:44:30,779
in grow facilities where people have

1103
00:44:26,699 --> 00:44:32,819
used RO water just in discriminately and

1104
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:34,260
say no yes I think I need this

1105
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:36,990
but they don't adjust their they don't

1106
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:38,850
have anything buffering it back when we

1107
00:44:36,989 --> 00:44:41,549
look at our systems even when we when we

1108
00:44:38,849 --> 00:44:45,989
sell an RO system we rarely tell the

1109
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:47,400
grower to use the RO water by itself we

1110
00:44:45,989 --> 00:44:50,009
generally are going to blend that back

1111
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:53,280
at some ratio to their original source

1112
00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:55,380
water number one is it's it's going to

1113
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:57,269
be easier to grow with Caesar's sphere

1114
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:58,200
you know it's kind of let you know when

1115
00:44:57,269 --> 00:45:00,300
you when you've got no buffering

1116
00:44:58,199 --> 00:45:02,399
capacity it's kind of like you can only

1117
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:04,080
make right turns in your car if you come

1118
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,889
up with kind of 30-degree angle you're

1119
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:06,299
not gonna be able to make it you're

1120
00:45:04,889 --> 00:45:08,210
going to make lunch or right turns back

1121
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:10,710
and forth back and forth to oversteer or

1122
00:45:08,210 --> 00:45:12,090
it's like sailing in of your sailor it's

1123
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:14,220
like sailing a sailboat directly into

1124
00:45:12,090 --> 00:45:16,320
the wind you've got to make a bunch of

1125
00:45:14,219 --> 00:45:18,839
tacks along the wind you can't go

1126
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:20,280
straight into the wind if we have more

1127
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:22,410
buffering capacity we can head more

1128
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:23,490
towards the lint and if I get a motor on

1129
00:45:22,409 --> 00:45:24,779
there because you don't you don't have

1130
00:45:23,489 --> 00:45:29,039
to over steer all the time you get

1131
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:29,850
yourself there but then that said ARRA

1132
00:45:29,039 --> 00:45:32,250
is expensive

1133
00:45:29,849 --> 00:45:36,529
especially when we're talking about you

1134
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:39,809
know water are becoming more expensive

1135
00:45:36,530 --> 00:45:42,120
water is going down part of the issue is

1136
00:45:39,809 --> 00:45:44,239
where you put the effluent from that you

1137
00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:46,980
know if you're getting 50 to 60 percent

1138
00:45:44,239 --> 00:45:48,779
conservatively out of there that you can

1139
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:51,240
use where does the forty to fifty

1140
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:53,190
percent go that you can't use that's now

1141
00:45:51,239 --> 00:45:54,539
concentrated with the salts and things

1142
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:55,950
that you took out of your water you got

1143
00:45:54,539 --> 00:45:58,050
to find a place to put that some places

1144
00:45:55,949 --> 00:46:01,919
won't let you do anything with that very

1145
00:45:58,050 --> 00:46:03,780
easily so it's it's a that's a concern

1146
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:05,700
we look at it from a standpoint of total

1147
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:07,650
water management if you've got you know

1148
00:46:05,699 --> 00:46:10,589
if I blend back at a 50 percent ratio

1149
00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:12,539
that means that you know I have a whole

1150
00:46:10,590 --> 00:46:14,250
lot less effluent as a percentage of my

1151
00:46:12,539 --> 00:46:16,949
total water going now I'm not I'm not

1152
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:19,110
stripping everything out and sending it

1153
00:46:16,949 --> 00:46:20,879
down the drain and then finally one of

1154
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:23,940
the things as a sprayer manufacturer

1155
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:25,920
that concerns us about ro in fact we we

1156
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:29,340
put labels on our equipment now that say

1157
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:32,220
do not use RO in this machine by itself

1158
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:36,180
straight ro we always recommend blending

1159
00:46:32,219 --> 00:46:37,739
back and the reason for that is ro as I

1160
00:46:36,179 --> 00:46:41,429
mentioned before is a universal solvent

1161
00:46:37,739 --> 00:46:43,379
it is hydrogen and oxygen mo if you go

1162
00:46:41,429 --> 00:46:44,969
to your tap right now you will not have

1163
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:46,619
only hydrogen oxygen and you will have

1164
00:46:44,969 --> 00:46:50,179
30 45

1165
00:46:46,619 --> 00:46:52,858
the other things in that water and

1166
00:46:50,179 --> 00:46:55,649
that's because water is when it's just

1167
00:46:52,858 --> 00:46:57,170
hydrogen oxygen is very hungry it wants

1168
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:59,910
to bond with other things with other

1169
00:46:57,170 --> 00:47:04,108
materials but other minerals metals

1170
00:46:59,909 --> 00:47:06,960
whatever if I put that water into

1171
00:47:04,108 --> 00:47:10,170
systems with certain metals and actually

1172
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:12,838
in in some instances all metals even

1173
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:15,298
stainless we can cause damage to those

1174
00:47:12,838 --> 00:47:19,130
components and we can also strip some of

1175
00:47:15,298 --> 00:47:23,548
the components of those metals out so ro

1176
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:26,430
going through brass fittings will start

1177
00:47:23,548 --> 00:47:29,429
to affect those brass fittings ro going

1178
00:47:26,429 --> 00:47:32,478
through brass fittings if we use certain

1179
00:47:29,429 --> 00:47:35,248
disinfectants with that like hyper

1180
00:47:32,478 --> 00:47:37,379
oxygen based peroxy acetic acid based

1181
00:47:35,248 --> 00:47:39,988
products will accelerate that

1182
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:43,140
dramatically stripping bits of the metal

1183
00:47:39,989 --> 00:47:44,639
out causing oxidation of those

1184
00:47:43,139 --> 00:47:47,699
components causing some of those

1185
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:49,848
components end up in the water causing

1186
00:47:47,699 --> 00:47:51,718
damage to the machine or where

1187
00:47:49,849 --> 00:47:53,249
potentially stripping some of those

1188
00:47:51,719 --> 00:47:55,679
components out and putting them on to

1189
00:47:53,248 --> 00:47:57,808
your crop so depending on what your crop

1190
00:47:55,679 --> 00:48:02,038
is you know and the Constituent metals

1191
00:47:57,809 --> 00:48:06,809
in your spray equipment plumbing you may

1192
00:48:02,039 --> 00:48:09,119
be applying those to the plant now in a

1193
00:48:06,809 --> 00:48:11,430
lot of instances that's not a big deal

1194
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:12,838
in some instances you know there's

1195
00:48:11,429 --> 00:48:14,278
there's some crops where people are

1196
00:48:12,838 --> 00:48:16,259
being tested for the metals that are on

1197
00:48:14,278 --> 00:48:17,940
the crop and so they have to be are

1198
00:48:16,259 --> 00:48:19,588
careful of that from an RO standpoint

1199
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:23,068
the RO is probably exacerbating the

1200
00:48:19,588 --> 00:48:24,630
problem that's fascinating I had no idea

1201
00:48:23,068 --> 00:48:26,369
you know I hear about people that

1202
00:48:24,630 --> 00:48:28,739
complain about their water and they just

1203
00:48:26,369 --> 00:48:31,079
go straight to RO systems and just use

1204
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:33,210
RO water but I here in the Seattle area

1205
00:48:31,079 --> 00:48:35,548
we're really fortunate we have we have

1206
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:37,619
really good water for the most part so I

1207
00:48:35,548 --> 00:48:41,159
haven't had to deal with that right but

1208
00:48:37,619 --> 00:48:43,588
that's a great explanation our arrow is

1209
00:48:41,159 --> 00:48:47,129
kind of a nuclear option it's it's just

1210
00:48:43,588 --> 00:48:48,808
it's a way over steer you you can go 20

1211
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:51,028
percent of the way there and do a much

1212
00:48:48,809 --> 00:48:54,028
better job you know it's it's not you

1213
00:48:51,028 --> 00:48:58,079
don't need to remove everything you know

1214
00:48:54,028 --> 00:49:00,030
there's you talk with somebody that is

1215
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:01,529
adapted water treatment and well we can

1216
00:49:00,030 --> 00:49:03,690
help you very easily say no this is

1217
00:49:01,530 --> 00:49:06,150
let's just let's target this and get it

1218
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:08,849
to a normal level not strip the whole

1219
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:12,389
thing out and start from scratch that's

1220
00:49:08,849 --> 00:49:13,920
great yeah that's really great I had I

1221
00:49:12,389 --> 00:49:16,889
did have a couple other quick questions

1222
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:18,570
for you here one of them was to talk a

1223
00:49:16,889 --> 00:49:20,460
little bit about this nematode bucket

1224
00:49:18,570 --> 00:49:23,100
that Suzanne Wainwright evidence raves

1225
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:24,929
about okay can you discuss a little

1226
00:49:23,099 --> 00:49:27,049
about why this came about and the

1227
00:49:24,929 --> 00:49:32,639
importance of it when applying nematodes

1228
00:49:27,050 --> 00:49:35,100
sure so one of the companies

1229
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:37,409
manufacturing nematodes a number of

1230
00:49:35,099 --> 00:49:38,969
years ago you know as I mentioned we

1231
00:49:37,409 --> 00:49:40,769
work a lot we work really closely with

1232
00:49:38,969 --> 00:49:41,909
the manufacturers of the different plant

1233
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:46,110
protection products that are in the

1234
00:49:41,909 --> 00:49:49,170
market they kind of came to us and said

1235
00:49:46,110 --> 00:49:52,800
hey you know we have a real issue with

1236
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:55,740
nematodes in our industry the biggest

1237
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:58,260
issue is that they they're aerobic

1238
00:49:55,739 --> 00:50:00,029
they breathe air we put them in water

1239
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:01,500
but they still breathe air and so what

1240
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:03,269
they'll do is they'll breathe up milk

1241
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:06,269
they'll suck up the oxygen in the tank

1242
00:50:03,269 --> 00:50:09,360
and start to go in oxic and so they'll

1243
00:50:06,269 --> 00:50:11,400
though they'll basically start to to

1244
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:13,470
suffocate if they're not you know so

1245
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:15,420
what we really need they said to us is

1246
00:50:13,469 --> 00:50:16,799
we need something that'll help agitate

1247
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:21,289
but it would be great if we could add

1248
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:23,970
oxygen at the same time so that it would

1249
00:50:21,289 --> 00:50:25,949
basically you know it would mix them up

1250
00:50:23,969 --> 00:50:27,779
in the tank which is good it's better

1251
00:50:25,949 --> 00:50:29,669
for distribution of the product as well

1252
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:31,980
as but it also helps keep the oxygen

1253
00:50:29,670 --> 00:50:33,599
mixed through the tank and if we can add

1254
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:35,639
some air that would be oxygen that would

1255
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:37,139
be great we started looking into

1256
00:50:35,639 --> 00:50:38,489
different ways to do it based on you

1257
00:50:37,139 --> 00:50:41,400
know some recommendations they said you

1258
00:50:38,489 --> 00:50:42,959
know hey we've done it with you know

1259
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:46,950
bubblers and things like that where we

1260
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:49,800
just pump air into the tank and we

1261
00:50:46,949 --> 00:50:52,409
started going down that road and are the

1262
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:54,570
first attempts we made we weren't ever

1263
00:50:52,409 --> 00:50:56,819
real happy because you know and then

1264
00:50:54,570 --> 00:50:59,130
that company basically said well can you

1265
00:50:56,820 --> 00:51:01,110
just you know help us get us the pump

1266
00:50:59,130 --> 00:51:03,150
and we'll tell customers hey buy this

1267
00:51:01,110 --> 00:51:05,130
air pump from DRAM and we'll you know

1268
00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:06,510
we'll put a little instructional video

1269
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:09,269
on our website showing them how they can

1270
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:11,130
make this and the problem with that is

1271
00:51:09,269 --> 00:51:14,340
when you compress air

1272
00:51:11,130 --> 00:51:16,200
it heats up and so one of the secondary

1273
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:17,820
concerns that they had that they told us

1274
00:51:16,199 --> 00:51:20,460
about when we first discussed this was

1275
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:22,530
we don't want the water to get hot when

1276
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:25,380
I compress air and pump it into a bucket

1277
00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:29,610
it tends to get hot now depends on how

1278
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:30,869
much compression I do for a while we you

1279
00:51:29,610 --> 00:51:32,579
know with the product kind of languor

1280
00:51:30,869 --> 00:51:36,719
for a little bit and I languished and we

1281
00:51:32,579 --> 00:51:38,340
didn't get didn't get it finished until

1282
00:51:36,719 --> 00:51:41,429
a number of years ago when we realized

1283
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:43,530
that we could inject oxygen into a

1284
00:51:41,429 --> 00:51:47,009
passing stream which wouldn't compress

1285
00:51:43,530 --> 00:51:48,540
the air instead of pumping the air and

1286
00:51:47,010 --> 00:51:50,370
that's what we started doing in fact

1287
00:51:48,539 --> 00:51:52,050
we've got a kit that we can now add to

1288
00:51:50,369 --> 00:51:53,849
the agitation systems on some of our

1289
00:51:52,050 --> 00:51:55,740
hydraulic sprayers you just add an air

1290
00:51:53,849 --> 00:51:58,799
kit to our hydraulic sprayer to

1291
00:51:55,739 --> 00:52:00,389
oxygenate the tank so we have a bucket

1292
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:02,910
so we started out by making a bucket

1293
00:52:00,389 --> 00:52:05,639
where it's it's really two buckets one

1294
00:52:02,909 --> 00:52:06,929
bucket houses all the components inside

1295
00:52:05,639 --> 00:52:10,319
of it and the other is just for the

1296
00:52:06,929 --> 00:52:12,059
liquid and what we do is we recirculate

1297
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:13,650
that so it's got a switch where we can

1298
00:52:12,059 --> 00:52:15,659
either turn on or off the air so it

1299
00:52:13,650 --> 00:52:17,369
allows us to use it as a agitation

1300
00:52:15,659 --> 00:52:19,679
system say for fertilizers and things as

1301
00:52:17,369 --> 00:52:21,210
well what we might not want the air

1302
00:52:19,679 --> 00:52:23,669
because it might kind of cause bubbling

1303
00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:26,190
and foaming but then we can flip a

1304
00:52:23,670 --> 00:52:29,250
switch turn on the air injection and

1305
00:52:26,190 --> 00:52:31,500
that will add oxygen and what we've been

1306
00:52:29,250 --> 00:52:35,460
able to do is maintain saturation levels

1307
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:37,469
of oxygen in the tank as we mix it now

1308
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:40,170
from a nematode standpoint you know

1309
00:52:37,469 --> 00:52:42,809
anybody using them at ODEs has probably

1310
00:52:40,170 --> 00:52:45,720
been very well cautioned that you want

1311
00:52:42,809 --> 00:52:47,219
to make sure that they're you know for

1312
00:52:45,719 --> 00:52:51,359
them to do the best job you want them to

1313
00:52:47,219 --> 00:52:53,189
be active and raring to go and you know

1314
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:55,800
if you look at just even some of the

1315
00:52:53,190 --> 00:52:57,780
instructional videos or theirs they'll

1316
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:59,730
show pictures showing what they should

1317
00:52:57,780 --> 00:53:00,990
look like under a microscope you don't

1318
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:03,000
want to see you want to see them

1319
00:53:00,989 --> 00:53:05,819
wiggling you don't want to see them all

1320
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:07,380
bent over and kind of stiff that you

1321
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:10,230
know they might still be alive but

1322
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:12,180
they're not real active so the idea of

1323
00:53:10,230 --> 00:53:15,000
adding the oxygen is to help keep them

1324
00:53:12,179 --> 00:53:19,319
in an optimal state to go and do their

1325
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:21,239
job mixing and agitating and oxygenating

1326
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:23,400
is going to do that and so we developed

1327
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:24,539
that that specifically for that product

1328
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,110
but the nice thing about the edge

1329
00:53:24,539 --> 00:53:28,110
stations

1330
00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:29,579
them is it'll it'll mix up fertilizer as

1331
00:53:28,110 --> 00:53:31,860
well so it's kind of a dual purpose

1332
00:53:29,579 --> 00:53:33,809
since you can flip off the switch and

1333
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:35,130
then we also make it in the we like I

1334
00:53:33,809 --> 00:53:36,750
said we make a kit for our spray

1335
00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:40,170
equipment but we also make a 50 gallon

1336
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:43,170
stock system for really large areas

1337
00:53:40,170 --> 00:53:45,000
we've got some large growers where it's

1338
00:53:43,170 --> 00:53:46,740
a 50 gallon tank with a dosatron on it

1339
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,820
like we had mentioned before this is one

1340
00:53:46,739 --> 00:53:49,739
of those places where we know it doen't

1341
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:55,559
Strunz no damaging a microbial product

1342
00:53:49,739 --> 00:53:57,509
or in this case a little worm but the we

1343
00:53:55,559 --> 00:53:59,279
have an agitation and aeration system on

1344
00:53:57,510 --> 00:54:01,890
that so that we can use it for a 50

1345
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:04,200
gallon stock tank full of of nematodes

1346
00:54:01,889 --> 00:54:06,750
that and that's being used in in large

1347
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:08,399
greenhouses where they're you know

1348
00:54:06,750 --> 00:54:10,079
basically where they are you know

1349
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:11,280
applying them through booms or or you

1350
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:13,259
know hand watering or whatever but

1351
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:16,350
they've got multiple areas they're doing

1352
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:18,990
it once so it also allows you to get an

1353
00:54:16,349 --> 00:54:22,710
even application as in a certain number

1354
00:54:18,989 --> 00:54:25,349
of nematodes per se per container or per

1355
00:54:22,710 --> 00:54:27,720
bed or per space that you're essentially

1356
00:54:25,349 --> 00:54:31,259
trying to cover over a given application

1357
00:54:27,719 --> 00:54:32,309
it's not right well yeah because what

1358
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:33,960
you're gonna do is you're gonna mix it

1359
00:54:32,309 --> 00:54:36,929
the you know it's important to be able

1360
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:38,730
to make sure the concentration is even

1361
00:54:36,929 --> 00:54:41,309
through the container through the stock

1362
00:54:38,730 --> 00:54:43,500
tank yeah so you know they said that you

1363
00:54:41,309 --> 00:54:46,170
know without agitation they tend to sink

1364
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:47,849
to the bottom breeze up all the oxygen

1365
00:54:46,170 --> 00:54:50,309
and then they start to suffocate

1366
00:54:47,849 --> 00:54:53,159
so agitation is helping one by mixing

1367
00:54:50,309 --> 00:54:55,079
them through the liquid and to the

1368
00:54:53,159 --> 00:54:58,190
aeration is helping by adding oxygen to

1369
00:54:55,079 --> 00:55:00,449
that liquid to keep them happy so

1370
00:54:58,190 --> 00:55:03,679
changing direction the last question I

1371
00:55:00,449 --> 00:55:05,939
have is I know Suzanne harps on this

1372
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:08,489
everyone like a lot of growers are using

1373
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:11,789
paint sprayers which are not designed

1374
00:55:08,489 --> 00:55:13,769
for you know horticultural applications

1375
00:55:11,789 --> 00:55:15,329
I know I was guilty of this when I first

1376
00:55:13,769 --> 00:55:17,940
started growing you know everyone has

1377
00:55:15,329 --> 00:55:21,389
access to a paint sprayer can you talk a

1378
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:22,800
little bit about the disadvantages and

1379
00:55:21,389 --> 00:55:24,659
what we're missing out when we're using

1380
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:29,130
something like that for a horticulture

1381
00:55:24,659 --> 00:55:31,139
application well I think that the

1382
00:55:29,130 --> 00:55:34,019
summary of that is exactly what you said

1383
00:55:31,139 --> 00:55:37,349
they're not really dissolved or designed

1384
00:55:34,019 --> 00:55:38,840
for spray applications of agricultural

1385
00:55:37,349 --> 00:55:42,900
products

1386
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:44,250
they generally aren't always the most

1387
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:45,539
durable pieces of equipment they're not

1388
00:55:44,250 --> 00:55:47,099
made for some of the products we're

1389
00:55:45,539 --> 00:55:50,340
putting in so they can cause damage to

1390
00:55:47,099 --> 00:55:51,960
seals most commonly that's what we see

1391
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:53,000
as seals and things fail and stuff like

1392
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:55,079
that

1393
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:57,510
pressures things like that aren't always

1394
00:55:55,079 --> 00:56:00,509
really well thought out there's there's

1395
00:55:57,510 --> 00:56:02,550
you know they're not designed for the

1396
00:56:00,510 --> 00:56:04,260
type of duty that's being put onto them

1397
00:56:02,550 --> 00:56:05,730
you know when someone's going to go use

1398
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:06,990
a paint sprayer most the time they're

1399
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:08,760
buying something they're gonna go paint

1400
00:56:06,989 --> 00:56:10,349
a wall and it's going to take them 15

1401
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:12,330
minutes and they're gonna be done you

1402
00:56:10,349 --> 00:56:14,099
know we've seen guys take that into

1403
00:56:12,329 --> 00:56:15,480
three four acres of greenhouse where

1404
00:56:14,099 --> 00:56:17,819
it's going to take them several hours

1405
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:21,630
and it's not the same kind of duty so

1406
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:24,240
from a standpoint of you know the size

1407
00:56:21,630 --> 00:56:26,940
of the motors and all that stuff it's

1408
00:56:24,239 --> 00:56:31,379
generally not meant for agricultural

1409
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:33,450
applications now that said some of the

1410
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:36,329
things that some of them try to achieve

1411
00:56:33,449 --> 00:56:39,059
you know we use an agricultural pump to

1412
00:56:36,329 --> 00:56:42,150
produce a 3,000 psi droplet to create a

1413
00:56:39,059 --> 00:56:44,009
spray that's a targeted spray paint

1414
00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:45,180
sprayers doing something trying to do

1415
00:56:44,010 --> 00:56:48,600
something similar although it's

1416
00:56:45,179 --> 00:56:53,509
generally using a diaphragm pump not a

1417
00:56:48,599 --> 00:56:55,949
piston style pump which depending on the

1418
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:57,140
the products that you're applying may be

1419
00:56:55,949 --> 00:56:59,449
better maybe worse

1420
00:56:57,139 --> 00:57:01,619
but those seats but the diaphragm itself

1421
00:56:59,449 --> 00:57:02,849
you know generally what we've seen with

1422
00:57:01,619 --> 00:57:05,429
paint sprayers is those diaphragms

1423
00:57:02,849 --> 00:57:07,469
themselves aren't aren't meant to

1424
00:57:05,429 --> 00:57:09,839
tolerate some of the products that go

1425
00:57:07,469 --> 00:57:11,789
through our machines and so certainly

1426
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:13,620
not powders they're just generally not

1427
00:57:11,789 --> 00:57:14,880
good for that they're meant you know for

1428
00:57:13,619 --> 00:57:18,960
the most part these things are meant to

1429
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:20,550
apply an oil-based priority or even a

1430
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:23,070
latex based product but they're not

1431
00:57:20,550 --> 00:57:24,780
they're not like water I mean it's a

1432
00:57:23,070 --> 00:57:26,130
different type of liquid and they

1433
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:27,120
certainly aren't gonna have powders so

1434
00:57:26,130 --> 00:57:30,269
most of the time they don't tolerate

1435
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:31,980
powders very well the nozzles aren't

1436
00:57:30,269 --> 00:57:33,570
really meant for that type of

1437
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:35,849
application as well they're generally

1438
00:57:33,570 --> 00:57:40,019
sometimes you know I think the best you

1439
00:57:35,849 --> 00:57:41,429
can get is a carbon steel tip which can

1440
00:57:40,019 --> 00:57:43,800
work in some cases but with other

1441
00:57:41,429 --> 00:57:46,739
products that doesn't work for a well I

1442
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:48,960
guess the biggest thing I can say is you

1443
00:57:46,739 --> 00:57:50,609
know looking at how something designed I

1444
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:52,380
mentioned earlier when I was talking

1445
00:57:50,610 --> 00:57:55,369
about hydraulic sprayers

1446
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:57,240
our philosophy about spray equipment is

1447
00:57:55,369 --> 00:57:58,920
you know you I wanted the right

1448
00:57:57,239 --> 00:58:00,508
pressures and I want to do the right

1449
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:02,220
thing I want to create the right droplet

1450
00:58:00,509 --> 00:58:03,599
but beyond that the second most

1451
00:58:02,219 --> 00:58:05,308
important thing that we think is

1452
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:09,210
important in a piece of equipment is

1453
00:58:05,309 --> 00:58:10,009
that it is designed to make that job

1454
00:58:09,210 --> 00:58:13,108
easier

1455
00:58:10,009 --> 00:58:14,759
meaning the hose reel the wheels the you

1456
00:58:13,108 --> 00:58:16,318
know the pump everything's not going to

1457
00:58:14,759 --> 00:58:18,150
fail in the middle of the job it's gonna

1458
00:58:16,318 --> 00:58:19,679
make it so that you don't have to worry

1459
00:58:18,150 --> 00:58:22,079
about flipping the switch turn the

1460
00:58:19,679 --> 00:58:24,088
pressure up and going and nothing's

1461
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:25,589
gonna get in the way of that and what we

1462
00:58:24,088 --> 00:58:28,048
find with paint spray equipment is

1463
00:58:25,588 --> 00:58:29,969
they're not they don't that's not they

1464
00:58:28,048 --> 00:58:32,730
haven't been designed for someone to

1465
00:58:29,969 --> 00:58:34,618
take out into a greenhouse and pull

1466
00:58:32,730 --> 00:58:37,230
around and spray you know everything

1467
00:58:34,619 --> 00:58:38,789
from I think you get maybe a 25 foot

1468
00:58:37,230 --> 00:58:40,858
hose on some of those things and you

1469
00:58:38,789 --> 00:58:43,170
know you got to pull it down an aisle or

1470
00:58:40,858 --> 00:58:44,848
you know they're meant to use a bucket

1471
00:58:43,170 --> 00:58:47,789
they don't agitate they don't you know

1472
00:58:44,849 --> 00:58:49,740
all those things all add up to making

1473
00:58:47,789 --> 00:58:51,509
the job in our opinion more difficult

1474
00:58:49,739 --> 00:58:52,828
and then when you have a pump that's

1475
00:58:51,509 --> 00:58:54,210
gonna start failing on you because it

1476
00:58:52,829 --> 00:58:55,559
wasn't meant to handle the products

1477
00:58:54,210 --> 00:58:57,690
you're putting through it it just makes

1478
00:58:55,559 --> 00:59:00,028
that job more and more difficult for the

1479
00:58:57,690 --> 00:59:03,659
grower and it might be cheaper to go buy

1480
00:59:00,028 --> 00:59:05,329
one of those but we look at from the

1481
00:59:03,659 --> 00:59:07,469
standpoint of you know you're going out

1482
00:59:05,329 --> 00:59:09,960
we look at there's there's there's

1483
00:59:07,469 --> 00:59:11,298
several different places of value in

1484
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:13,858
pesticide application

1485
00:59:11,298 --> 00:59:14,880
one is the labor that's involved you

1486
00:59:13,858 --> 00:59:16,650
know the people that are doing the job

1487
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:18,358
you're paying them okay

1488
00:59:16,650 --> 00:59:21,990
there's there's there's the other value

1489
00:59:18,358 --> 00:59:24,659
is there their happiness in your

1490
00:59:21,989 --> 00:59:26,159
workplace those types of things

1491
00:59:24,659 --> 00:59:28,199
typically tend to suffer when you have

1492
00:59:26,159 --> 00:59:30,598
products that that you have equipment

1493
00:59:28,199 --> 00:59:32,689
that doesn't hold up and do what they

1494
00:59:30,599 --> 00:59:36,298
need to customer you know the guy or the

1495
00:59:32,690 --> 00:59:38,940
guy spraying get frustrated and it

1496
00:59:36,298 --> 00:59:41,219
becomes a problem more importantly you

1497
00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:43,650
know so you have the consideration of

1498
00:59:41,219 --> 00:59:45,598
the other value when you're doing this

1499
00:59:43,650 --> 00:59:48,480
and that's your crop you know the plants

1500
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:51,180
that you are spraying you know they're

1501
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:55,469
out but there's the potential in some of

1502
00:59:51,179 --> 00:59:57,389
those diaphragm based paint sprayers for

1503
00:59:55,469 --> 00:59:58,409
that diaphragm the cracked especially

1504
00:59:57,389 --> 01:00:01,858
with some of the products we're using

1505
00:59:58,409 --> 01:00:03,598
that they're not meant to tolerate and a

1506
01:00:01,858 --> 01:00:06,059
diaphragm cracking behind that that

1507
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:10,620
diaphragm is a big chamber

1508
01:00:06,059 --> 01:00:13,019
of pressurized motor oil do you want

1509
01:00:10,619 --> 01:00:14,489
that to be sprayed on your crop I looked

1510
01:00:13,019 --> 01:00:16,909
at like a piston style pump it's

1511
01:00:14,489 --> 01:00:20,039
actually designed so that if there is a

1512
01:00:16,909 --> 01:00:21,899
seal failure the water flows into the

1513
01:00:20,039 --> 01:00:24,989
oil not the oil flowing in the water

1514
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:27,119
because the pressurized side is where is

1515
01:00:24,989 --> 01:00:28,799
where the water is the liquidus we're

1516
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:30,059
pressurizing liquid side with a system

1517
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:33,570
like that the oil only serves to

1518
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:35,969
lubricate the Pistons in a diaphragm

1519
01:00:33,570 --> 01:00:38,100
based pump we're pressurizing a chamber

1520
01:00:35,969 --> 01:00:39,959
which makes the diaphragm fluctuate up

1521
01:00:38,099 --> 01:00:43,650
and down which then transfers that

1522
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:46,380
pressure to the liquid if that diaphragm

1523
01:00:43,650 --> 01:00:49,139
fails that oil goes right out the

1524
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:50,940
sprayer and when the kind of droplets

1525
01:00:49,139 --> 01:00:53,009
and things that were applying you know

1526
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:55,409
with that type of equipment the

1527
01:00:53,010 --> 01:00:57,570
potential for damage to the crop you

1528
01:00:55,409 --> 01:00:59,519
know I don't think anybody really wants

1529
01:00:57,570 --> 01:01:00,480
to spray motor oil onto their plants I

1530
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:01,199
don't think anybody would think that'd

1531
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:05,219
be a good idea

1532
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:06,929
and so we look at prop value is one of

1533
01:01:05,219 --> 01:01:09,299
the reasons why yeah okay I might have

1534
01:01:06,929 --> 01:01:13,199
gone to Home Depot on demo by a cheap

1535
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:17,250
paint sprayer but what's the potential

1536
01:01:13,199 --> 01:01:19,230
liability in doing that what's the

1537
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:21,750
potential cost to that depending on the

1538
01:01:19,230 --> 01:01:23,429
value of your crop could be very high so

1539
01:01:21,750 --> 01:01:25,260
that's that's one of those things that

1540
01:01:23,429 --> 01:01:26,639
it always makes me scratch my head when

1541
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:28,170
I see somebody buying something cheap

1542
01:01:26,639 --> 01:01:29,789
like that and then I walk into a room

1543
01:01:28,170 --> 01:01:32,639
and they've got a million dollars for

1544
01:01:29,789 --> 01:01:36,300
the plants in there and you say okay is

1545
01:01:32,639 --> 01:01:39,210
this it's just really a good saving of

1546
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:41,580
money by you know you saved a thousand

1547
01:01:39,210 --> 01:01:44,250
bucks you know is that is that is that

1548
01:01:41,579 --> 01:01:45,929
smart so that's that's kind of my

1549
01:01:44,250 --> 01:01:47,369
opinion on on those types of equipment I

1550
01:01:45,929 --> 01:01:49,079
don't think that they are meant to do

1551
01:01:47,369 --> 01:01:51,329
the job they generally don't hold up to

1552
01:01:49,079 --> 01:01:55,230
the job they cause potential liability

1553
01:01:51,329 --> 01:01:56,699
and you know then again like I said our

1554
01:01:55,230 --> 01:01:59,010
philosophy is building for ease of use

1555
01:01:56,699 --> 01:02:02,099
so that the guy doing the job is

1556
01:01:59,010 --> 01:02:03,930
comfortable doing it well and I would

1557
01:02:02,099 --> 01:02:05,880
think the biggest factor that you

1558
01:02:03,929 --> 01:02:07,859
mentioned earlier in our conversation

1559
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:10,380
what I've learned from you is that the

1560
01:02:07,860 --> 01:02:12,000
droplet size may not be optimal and so

1561
01:02:10,380 --> 01:02:13,890
we may not getting the actual coverage

1562
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:16,619
on the leaf surface that we want so the

1563
01:02:13,889 --> 01:02:17,819
the spray application itself may not be

1564
01:02:16,619 --> 01:02:19,589
as effective

1565
01:02:17,820 --> 01:02:22,559
which well that's certainly true it

1566
01:02:19,590 --> 01:02:24,990
hasn't been designed for spraying plants

1567
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:26,400
yeah we don't know what it's producing

1568
01:02:24,989 --> 01:02:27,989
you know some of those are produced are

1569
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:29,550
capable producing some pretty pretty

1570
01:02:27,989 --> 01:02:31,049
fine droplets but they're meant to be

1571
01:02:29,550 --> 01:02:33,240
doing that with like a varnish or

1572
01:02:31,050 --> 01:02:34,170
something you know so so yeah that's

1573
01:02:33,239 --> 01:02:35,819
that's a good point

1574
01:02:34,170 --> 01:02:38,159
so we need the right tool for the right

1575
01:02:35,820 --> 01:02:40,140
job which brings up one other thing that

1576
01:02:38,159 --> 01:02:42,690
I was thinking of because I was out in

1577
01:02:40,139 --> 01:02:44,279
my garden and I have one of your I think

1578
01:02:42,690 --> 01:02:46,079
I think that's called a professional

1579
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:48,390
wand I know you have a bunch of

1580
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:49,799
different lines so probably a rain wand

1581
01:02:48,389 --> 01:02:51,329
or you know it's some sort of rain one

1582
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:52,500
but I have I have one of your ones and

1583
01:02:51,329 --> 01:02:54,360
it has a really small head that's

1584
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:58,230
probably the size of like a half-dollar

1585
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:59,940
or smaller okay and it's it's a nice

1586
01:02:58,230 --> 01:03:02,039
high-quality one and I used that in my

1587
01:02:59,940 --> 01:03:03,420
raised beds out front now I was I need

1588
01:03:02,039 --> 01:03:05,969
one for the hose in the back and I went

1589
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:08,550
and bought a $10 one at Fred Meyer I

1590
01:03:05,969 --> 01:03:10,230
can't remember the brand name and it has

1591
01:03:08,550 --> 01:03:13,260
all these nozzle adjustments I can make

1592
01:03:10,230 --> 01:03:18,389
from wat from shower to mist - whatever

1593
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:20,100
and when I go to water with the nice

1594
01:03:18,389 --> 01:03:23,400
DRAM wand that I have in the front yard

1595
01:03:20,099 --> 01:03:25,799
I get a really nice spray that's high

1596
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:27,809
volume but low pressure so I can water

1597
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:29,460
my tomatoes my peppers without damaging

1598
01:03:27,809 --> 01:03:32,130
them while they're small you know still

1599
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:33,960
starting out whereas the the other one

1600
01:03:32,130 --> 01:03:35,490
in the back even when I switch to

1601
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:37,500
different nozzles like shower that's

1602
01:03:35,489 --> 01:03:39,629
supposedly going to be higher volume

1603
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:42,750
less pressure I'm still like shooting it

1604
01:03:39,630 --> 01:03:44,760
at this poor plant and stressing that

1605
01:03:42,750 --> 01:03:46,739
plant out so having the right tool and

1606
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:48,390
maybe spending a little more on like

1607
01:03:46,739 --> 01:03:51,929
your water wands are phenomenal that's

1608
01:03:48,389 --> 01:03:53,730
sort of where I associate DRAM you know

1609
01:03:51,929 --> 01:03:54,809
you started with this whole this whole

1610
01:03:53,730 --> 01:03:57,119
side of things

1611
01:03:54,809 --> 01:04:00,000
I suggest users give them a shot because

1612
01:03:57,119 --> 01:04:02,069
they're great well thank you yeah that's

1613
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:04,650
we started 77 years ago with the

1614
01:04:02,070 --> 01:04:06,720
invention of the 400 al aluminum water

1615
01:04:04,650 --> 01:04:09,000
breaker and that's what's really what we

1616
01:04:06,719 --> 01:04:13,379
started as as company is a hand watering

1617
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:15,539
company now we make dozens of different

1618
01:04:13,380 --> 01:04:17,309
nozzles and we don't make them you know

1619
01:04:15,539 --> 01:04:18,929
we do have a consumer side of our

1620
01:04:17,309 --> 01:04:21,150
business where we sell those in

1621
01:04:18,929 --> 01:04:22,949
different colors but we on the

1622
01:04:21,150 --> 01:04:24,720
professional end we make them all with

1623
01:04:22,949 --> 01:04:26,159
different patterns different hole sizes

1624
01:04:24,719 --> 01:04:28,769
all meant to do different things

1625
01:04:26,159 --> 01:04:31,159
different widths of patterns we actually

1626
01:04:28,769 --> 01:04:32,900
have you know on the professional and we

1627
01:04:31,159 --> 01:04:35,269
a video with series of videos to talk

1628
01:04:32,900 --> 01:04:36,740
about you know how to water and and

1629
01:04:35,269 --> 01:04:38,599
using the right tool for the job

1630
01:04:36,739 --> 01:04:40,279
you know there's some times when you

1631
01:04:38,599 --> 01:04:42,469
need a lot of water sometimes don't need

1632
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:44,870
a lot of water use the right tool when

1633
01:04:42,469 --> 01:04:46,309
when doing that because as you said I

1634
01:04:44,869 --> 01:04:49,279
mean one of one of my biggest pet peeves

1635
01:04:46,309 --> 01:04:52,279
is those multi-pattern heads because

1636
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:53,840
they're you know the old friend is jack

1637
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:57,110
of all trades and master of none they

1638
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:58,430
don't do anything well you get you get

1639
01:04:57,110 --> 01:05:00,230
might get nine different things you can

1640
01:04:58,429 --> 01:05:02,269
do with it but none of them is real is

1641
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:04,760
as good as what it would be if you

1642
01:05:02,269 --> 01:05:07,699
bought the two or three nozzles that you

1643
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:08,900
selected it for you know and that's so I

1644
01:05:07,699 --> 01:05:10,639
appreciate you saying that because

1645
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:12,230
that's yeah those are that's a very

1646
01:05:10,639 --> 01:05:14,329
important part of our business you know

1647
01:05:12,230 --> 01:05:15,800
hand watering is and we never you know

1648
01:05:14,329 --> 01:05:18,079
we've always known it's important but

1649
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:22,039
especially when we talk to professional

1650
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:25,069
growers it's people that that water all

1651
01:05:22,039 --> 01:05:27,800
day you know and take it seriously you

1652
01:05:25,070 --> 01:05:29,510
they are very protective very religious

1653
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:32,930
about the watering tools they use in

1654
01:05:29,510 --> 01:05:34,640
fact I mean it's it's very nice to be in

1655
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:37,399
that position to be trusted that well

1656
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:38,779
because we don't have you know we may

1657
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:40,760
have plenty of competition on the

1658
01:05:38,780 --> 01:05:42,590
consumer end where we're selling to you

1659
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:46,040
know every home gardener you know

1660
01:05:42,590 --> 01:05:48,470
anybody with a with a potted plant but

1661
01:05:46,039 --> 01:05:50,659
on the professional and we don't have a

1662
01:05:48,469 --> 01:05:52,129
lot of competition because nobody did

1663
01:05:50,659 --> 01:05:54,170
all the other stuff that's out there is

1664
01:05:52,130 --> 01:05:55,519
just isn't it's not it's not meant for

1665
01:05:54,170 --> 01:05:57,559
professional use it's meant for a

1666
01:05:55,519 --> 01:06:00,250
homeowner years and we've you know we've

1667
01:05:57,559 --> 01:06:02,449
been trusted by the commercial

1668
01:06:00,250 --> 01:06:05,269
horticultural industry for so long that

1669
01:06:02,449 --> 01:06:06,949
you know it's it's a its position we

1670
01:06:05,269 --> 01:06:09,230
don't take lightly in fact we just you

1671
01:06:06,949 --> 01:06:11,809
know just announced we're modifying one

1672
01:06:09,230 --> 01:06:13,250
of our oldest trolls and offering a

1673
01:06:11,809 --> 01:06:14,750
protective ring on the outside of it

1674
01:06:13,250 --> 01:06:16,190
that they could because other customers

1675
01:06:14,750 --> 01:06:18,260
have been asking for it we come up with

1676
01:06:16,190 --> 01:06:20,240
different nozzles and and valves and

1677
01:06:18,260 --> 01:06:22,700
things all the time because we don't

1678
01:06:20,239 --> 01:06:24,529
want to take for granted that market

1679
01:06:22,699 --> 01:06:28,519
which in our opinion is you know the

1680
01:06:24,530 --> 01:06:30,830
professional markets very picky and we

1681
01:06:28,519 --> 01:06:32,480
liked and and so are we so it's good fit

1682
01:06:30,829 --> 01:06:34,819
so I like that I'd appreciate you

1683
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:38,389
bringing that up yeah when I'm watering

1684
01:06:34,820 --> 01:06:39,769
my front garden with a nozzle and it's

1685
01:06:38,389 --> 01:06:41,929
not as it's not as good of one you know

1686
01:06:39,769 --> 01:06:43,460
it's it's annoying but when I go to the

1687
01:06:41,929 --> 01:06:47,210
Torre nursery and I have to water

1688
01:06:43,460 --> 01:06:48,889
for two hours you know I can cut off you

1689
01:06:47,210 --> 01:06:52,820
know a half an hour to an hour of time

1690
01:06:48,889 --> 01:06:54,980
just by using a better nozzle and right

1691
01:06:52,820 --> 01:06:57,740
with that cost of labor and like you

1692
01:06:54,980 --> 01:07:00,110
said the happiness of the of the the

1693
01:06:57,739 --> 01:07:02,239
labor using that product it makes a big

1694
01:07:00,110 --> 01:07:04,130
difference because it drives me crazy

1695
01:07:02,239 --> 01:07:06,679
when I'm when the water pressure is so

1696
01:07:04,130 --> 01:07:09,349
high that I'm actually shooting soil

1697
01:07:06,679 --> 01:07:12,379
back up onto the leaf tissue of my plant

1698
01:07:09,349 --> 01:07:14,750
it it's not good so oh definitely no I

1699
01:07:12,380 --> 01:07:17,150
really do appreciate your your higher

1700
01:07:14,750 --> 01:07:19,460
