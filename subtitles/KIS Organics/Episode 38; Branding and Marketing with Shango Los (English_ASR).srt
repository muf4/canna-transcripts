science podcast

I'm your host CAD Hussey of KISS

5
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:26,879
organics this is the podcast where we

6
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,890
discuss the cutting-edge organic growing

7
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:30,570
from a science-based perspective and

8
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,070
drawn top experts from around the

9
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:34,020
industry to share their wisdom and

10
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:36,570
knowledge I want to warn listeners that

11
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,640
today's podcast is not about cultivation

12
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,770
I do have some great guests lined up

13
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,058
soon for more interviews on growing but

14
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:44,579
today I want to discuss another

15
00:00:42,058 --> 00:00:46,649
important topic for anyone growing

16
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:47,730
cannabis as a business or working in the

17
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:49,770
cannabis industry

18
00:00:47,729 --> 00:00:51,808
you know that having a great product or

19
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,059
growing top-shelf cannabis is only half

20
00:00:51,808 --> 00:00:55,828
the story the other half is shaping your

21
00:00:54,058 --> 00:00:58,709
message in a way to effectively reach

22
00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:00,239
your audience on that note I had the

23

information with our listeners yeah and

67
00:02:35,829 --> 00:02:39,250
it's a little different than your other

68
00:02:36,848 --> 00:02:41,738
shows too because I like I enjoy

69
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:44,169
listening to your your podcast and you

70
00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:46,569
know it's it's all very scientific and

71
00:02:44,169 --> 00:02:48,939
the the idea that we're gonna kind of

72
00:02:46,568 --> 00:02:51,189
plug in some marketing information for

73
00:02:48,939 --> 00:02:53,079
for people out there that are bringing

74
00:02:51,189 --> 00:02:54,699
some kind of cannabis related product to

75
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:56,230
market I think I think that it's going

76
00:02:54,699 --> 00:02:59,979
to be you know a fun little something

77
00:02:56,229 --> 00:03:01,238
different yeah I think so too and I kind

78
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:02,469
of wanted to start off by giving

79
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:06,280
listeners a little bit of background

80
00:03:02,469 --> 00:03:10,299
into who you are and what what you're

81
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:12,068
all about right now cool so um so I

82
00:03:10,299 --> 00:03:13,780
guess the the two important things about

83
00:03:12,068 --> 00:03:15,388
my background that that would would

84
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:18,669
inform our discussion today would be

85
00:03:15,389 --> 00:03:21,879
number one I've been doing brand

86
00:03:18,669 --> 00:03:23,409
strategy and marketing and what we used

87
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:27,340
to call back in the day in the dot-com

88
00:03:23,409 --> 00:03:29,918
boom product evangelism you know for you

89
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:31,329
know over 20 years or so and and I was

90
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:34,359
lucky enough you know I did the first

91
00:03:31,329 --> 00:03:37,329
dot-com boom and all of that chaos an

92
00:03:34,359 --> 00:03:38,859
investment capital and and I got to live

93
00:03:37,329 --> 00:03:41,560
that experience and and at that time

94
00:03:38,859 --> 00:03:44,590
people always said oh my gosh to to be

95
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:47,199
alive and to be an entrepreneur you know

96
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:49,689
when a whole new industry starts this is

97
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:50,918
a once and a lifetime thing and I was

98
00:03:49,689 --> 00:03:53,199
very grateful for it you know I was in

99
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:54,489
my early 20s and I was making more money

100
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:56,708
than I ever had in my life right then

101
00:03:54,489 --> 00:03:59,019
and the funny thing is that once in a

102
00:03:56,709 --> 00:04:01,930
lifetime experience who I'm having again

103
00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:04,239
now in cannabis and and so I'm very

104
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:06,879
grateful to you know be alive in this

105
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,629
time and to be able to participate so

106
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:11,419
but back in the dot-com age

107
00:04:08,629 --> 00:04:12,949
you know or the first boom we were doing

108
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:15,199
lots of tech related stuff and we were

109
00:04:12,949 --> 00:04:17,959
doing a lot of brand building and and

110
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:20,539
and destroying a lot of companies and

111
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:23,959
and then building some that survived too

112
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:26,300
so that was great but but as far as what

113
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:28,609
we're talking about today

114
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:32,300
I think the most relevance is is since

115
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:34,569
2013 I've been helping cannabis related

116
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:36,770
companies bring their products to market

117
00:04:34,569 --> 00:04:39,259
it all started with I founded this

118
00:04:36,769 --> 00:04:41,689
organization here on Vashon Island where

119
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:45,370
I live that brought together all the

120
00:04:41,689 --> 00:04:47,839
medical growers so this was this was pre

121
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:50,180
taxation and normalization here in

122
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:52,129
Washington State and you know people

123
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:54,019
were getting together and and I live on

124
00:04:52,129 --> 00:04:55,399
this island in the and the farmers were

125
00:04:54,019 --> 00:04:57,740
just competing against each other

126
00:04:55,399 --> 00:05:00,529
selling against each other on the island

127
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:02,960
and so we had very low prices for very

128
00:05:00,529 --> 00:05:05,899
high quality flour and value-added

129
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:08,810
products like RSO and edibles and things

130
00:05:05,899 --> 00:05:10,399
like that and and when I kind of

131
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:12,230
realized what was going on I'm like oh

132
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:14,569
my gosh all you farmers could make so

133
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:16,879
much more money if we got the product

134
00:05:14,569 --> 00:05:19,939
off the island if we got it into the

135
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:23,899
dispensaries in other parts of the state

136
00:05:19,939 --> 00:05:25,939
and and since it was legal enough I you

137
00:05:23,899 --> 00:05:28,039
know I started this this group called

138
00:05:25,939 --> 00:05:31,250
Vimeo the Vashon Island marijuana

139
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:32,810
entrepreneurs Alliance and and I and I

140
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:35,930
know that the word marijuana is not

141
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:38,990
really people don't embrace that as much

142
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:41,540
as they did but in 2013 you know I

143
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:43,069
didn't I didn't understand that cannabis

144
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:45,830
it was going to be our preferred word

145
00:05:43,069 --> 00:05:47,180
anyway so so I pulled together all the

146
00:05:45,829 --> 00:05:49,129
for all the farmers and I said listen

147
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:51,980
you know I can help build these

148
00:05:49,129 --> 00:05:54,829
relationships with the dispensaries over

149
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:56,629
town off the island and then we if we

150
00:05:54,829 --> 00:06:00,019
all work together we can do things like

151
00:05:56,629 --> 00:06:02,269
bye-bye soil and bulk and living soil

152
00:06:00,019 --> 00:06:05,180
nutrients in bulk and packaging in bulk

153
00:06:02,269 --> 00:06:07,339
to bring everybody's cost down and then

154
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:09,050
to bring your profit up and of course

155
00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:10,399
they were all like into this idea so

156
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:13,490
that's that's really where I got my

157
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:15,439
start bringing my you know the the brand

158
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:17,840
strategy and marketing and operational

159
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:20,509
stuff that I had been doing in tech into

160
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:21,528
cannabis because I myself am a cannabis

161
00:06:20,509 --> 00:06:24,858
patient

162
00:06:21,528 --> 00:06:26,418
a traumatic brain injury and then and

163
00:06:24,858 --> 00:06:29,899
then started teaching what I knew to

164
00:06:26,418 --> 00:06:33,558
people here on the island and so after

165
00:06:29,899 --> 00:06:35,598
helping the growers on the island kind

166
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:37,309
of set up this distribution network

167
00:06:35,598 --> 00:06:39,649
through the Washington medical system

168
00:06:37,309 --> 00:06:41,869
people started asking me for help with

169
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:45,079
with you know different products a you

170
00:06:41,869 --> 00:06:47,899
know a soil nutrient or a you know a

171
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:49,158
specialty you know value-added canvas

172
00:06:47,899 --> 00:06:51,798
product and then and then it's just been

173
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:54,528
continuing on now for four five years or

174
00:06:51,798 --> 00:06:56,418
so I must admit I'm I'm kind of moving

175
00:06:54,528 --> 00:06:58,098
away from the consulting well I'm still

176
00:06:56,418 --> 00:07:00,079
available for like products that I think

177
00:06:58,098 --> 00:07:03,319
are cool now that the shaping fire

178
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:05,449
podcast is taken off so much and and I'm

179
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:07,338
traveling a lot to do that and to

180
00:07:05,449 --> 00:07:08,838
interview people and to speak I'm not

181
00:07:07,338 --> 00:07:11,118
doing nearly as much consulting I'm

182
00:07:08,838 --> 00:07:12,499
doing but it doesn't mean that my brain

183
00:07:11,119 --> 00:07:15,319
doesn't think about it all the time

184
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:17,569
still yeah that's great you know I've

185
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:19,209
had a lot of discussions about marketing

186
00:07:17,569 --> 00:07:24,439
and you've actually helped me with

187
00:07:19,209 --> 00:07:26,298
considering how to position or look at

188
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:27,739
another podcast and I'm looking at

189
00:07:26,298 --> 00:07:29,688
starting and some other stuff so I've

190
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:30,859
really appreciated your your knowledge

191
00:07:29,689 --> 00:07:33,159
and your perspective on things

192
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:35,559
throughout the years I think it's great

193
00:07:33,158 --> 00:07:37,998
well cool I'm glad I could be helpful

194
00:07:35,559 --> 00:07:40,249
yeah so now that we know a little bit

195
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:41,838
about you and I have to say like if you

196
00:07:40,249 --> 00:07:43,819
meet Shangaan person you would never

197
00:07:41,838 --> 00:07:47,749
picture that he was this like tech guy

198
00:07:43,819 --> 00:07:50,028
you know he you feel to me like someone

199
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:53,989
who's been around cannabis your whole

200
00:07:50,028 --> 00:07:56,509
life and yeah the Vashon Island is just

201
00:07:53,988 --> 00:07:59,088
such this amazing place for artists and

202
00:07:56,509 --> 00:08:02,838
on and people looking to kind of get

203
00:07:59,088 --> 00:08:04,218
away from sort of every city life yet be

204
00:08:02,838 --> 00:08:05,959
pretty close to the city it's such a

205
00:08:04,218 --> 00:08:07,368
cool experience if people ever get a

206
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:09,468
chance to make it out there I highly

207
00:08:07,369 --> 00:08:10,969
recommend it yeah I'm really I'm really

208
00:08:09,468 --> 00:08:12,949
lucky and actually it was my brain

209
00:08:10,968 --> 00:08:15,558
injury that brought me to Vashon I used

210
00:08:12,949 --> 00:08:17,449
to live in Seattle proper and my after

211
00:08:15,559 --> 00:08:18,879
my brain injury my neurologist said you

212
00:08:17,449 --> 00:08:22,179
know if you really want to heal properly

213
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:24,829
yeah use the cannabis medicine but also

214
00:08:22,178 --> 00:08:28,128
you should move out of town and so I

215
00:08:24,829 --> 00:08:29,718
moved here to Vashon in in 2011 and

216
00:08:28,129 --> 00:08:33,709
that's been pretty great and you know

217
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:35,200
even though I only started really you

218
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:37,418
know being involved with cannabis

219
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,270
business in 2013 I mean I've been

220
00:08:37,418 --> 00:08:43,120
talking since since college so you know

221
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:45,939
that's like 1989 I got turned on to

222
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,620
smoking cannabis so I've been in

223
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:51,010
cannabis culture and I'm a Deadhead too

224
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:53,080
right so yeah I followed the Grateful

225
00:08:51,009 --> 00:08:55,240
Dead for a couple years and you know I

226
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:57,639
still I still listen to them you know

227
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:59,769
weekly so you know I'm an old head it

228
00:08:57,639 --> 00:09:02,259
was kind of funny too recently this this

229
00:08:59,769 --> 00:09:05,259
year I let my hair grow again because

230
00:09:02,259 --> 00:09:07,210
you know at the beginning of this more

231
00:09:05,259 --> 00:09:08,769
formalized version of cannabis that

232
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:11,110
we're getting into a lot of the early

233
00:09:08,769 --> 00:09:13,299
people they you know they wanted to talk

234
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:14,680
to people in suits they didn't want to

235
00:09:13,299 --> 00:09:17,019
trust their millions of dollars to

236
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:19,299
somebody who didn't look like who they

237
00:09:17,019 --> 00:09:20,889
were familiar with so when I started in

238
00:09:19,299 --> 00:09:22,479
cannabis you know I had my hair a little

239
00:09:20,889 --> 00:09:25,120
shorter and when I would speak at

240
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,980
conventions I would wear a suit and then

241
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,620
after a couple years of that I realized

242
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:31,690
that the kind of people that I attracted

243
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:33,610
in my suit was was different than the

244
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:35,920
people I wanted to work with so I said

245
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:38,080
ah hell and I just let my hair grow long

246
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:40,059
and Farrell again and and I wear my

247
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,530
normal clothes too and and and and

248
00:09:40,059 --> 00:09:43,000
everything's still fine and I'm still

249
00:09:41,529 --> 00:09:45,819
making money and people still want to

250
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,639
hear my my opinions so I just decided

251
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:51,129
that wearing a suit was a was a not not

252
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:52,750
an important variable nice well that

253
00:09:51,129 --> 00:09:54,100
talks a little about your own personal

254
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:56,649
brand and how you wanted to position

255
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:59,409
yourself in the market and be perceived

256
00:09:56,649 --> 00:10:00,850
so I think that's right on topic but

257
00:09:59,409 --> 00:10:03,129
let's let's go ahead and dive in a

258
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:05,409
little bit now about some of the things

259
00:10:03,129 --> 00:10:07,840
you and I talked about in terms of

260
00:10:05,409 --> 00:10:08,860
branding and marketing I wanted you to

261
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,710
be able to give a little bit of a

262
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:13,480
foundation for say growers or someone

263
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:16,120
who had a product that was coming out in

264
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:18,700
the cannabis industry could you give us

265
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:21,100
a little bit of a foundation around best

266
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:24,090
practices and things that would gallon

267
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:27,279
the marketing side yeah for sure so so

268
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:30,460
I'll take a little module out of a out

269
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:31,839
of a class that I teach and and this is

270
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:34,120
also where I start with all of my

271
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:37,120
consulting clients just to put us on on

272
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:41,830
the same page so I'll go through five

273
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:44,289
categories of a brand strategy I guess

274
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:48,670
we'll call it that should be considered

275
00:10:44,289 --> 00:10:50,289
both by by folks who are are launching a

276
00:10:48,669 --> 00:10:52,539
you know a farm or something that's

277
00:10:50,289 --> 00:10:55,839
going to produce cannabis itself but

278
00:10:52,539 --> 00:10:59,019
this also works just as well for a non

279
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:02,040
regulated product whether it be you know

280
00:10:59,019 --> 00:11:04,779
bongs and pipes and rolling papers or

281
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:05,589
your like like living soil nutrition or

282
00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:08,019
something so

283
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:10,290
so there's five categories the first one

284
00:11:08,019 --> 00:11:12,819
is going to be naming a lot of people

285
00:11:10,289 --> 00:11:15,519
they've got the name that they've been

286
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:17,650
calling their project in their head and

287
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,960
so it's kind of like a default that

288
00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:22,120
that's what the name of the business is

289
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:24,190
going to be but there are some really

290
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:27,759
important things to think about when

291
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:30,580
choosing a name for example you want to

292
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:31,840
make sure that you know it's unique in

293
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:34,090
cannabis right you want to make sure

294
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:36,490
there's not already somebody doing that

295
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:40,090
name also you want to pick something

296
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:41,049
that is is has got some kind of unique

297
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:44,440
word in it

298
00:11:41,049 --> 00:11:46,029
so that it's easily searchable right you

299
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,560
know if that's why we get a lot of these

300
00:11:46,029 --> 00:11:49,149
these companies called like purple

301
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:51,159
penguin right because you don't usually

302
00:11:49,149 --> 00:11:52,959
get the word purple in the word penguin

303
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:55,000
next to each other so if somebody

304
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:57,310
Google's purple penguin they come right

305
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,220
up if you were to call your company

306
00:11:57,309 --> 00:12:04,659
let's say green rush right one of the

307
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:07,029
most common terms used in cannabis media

308
00:12:04,659 --> 00:12:09,009
right now you know if you put in Green

309
00:12:07,029 --> 00:12:10,870
Rush company they're not gonna find your

310
00:12:09,009 --> 00:12:13,240
company right there's going to be all of

311
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:19,810
these news articles about the Green Rush

312
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:21,820
and so I encourage my clients to to do a

313
00:12:19,809 --> 00:12:24,639
little brainstorming to find something

314
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:27,010
that it's unique that catches the spirit

315
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,870
of how they want to be seen and and and

316
00:12:27,009 --> 00:12:31,360
you know in the old days we would do

317
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:33,909
like a whole half day brainstorming

318
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,100
workshop but most folks don't have time

319
00:12:33,909 --> 00:12:37,419
or resources to do that so so I just

320
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:41,139
recommend this this quick little

321
00:12:37,419 --> 00:12:45,789
exercise to get you going which is to to

322
00:12:41,139 --> 00:12:50,019
brainstorm 50 descriptive words for what

323
00:12:45,789 --> 00:12:51,579
you do or sell and and when you get to

324
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:54,100
probably you know somewhere between

325
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:57,160
eight and twelve it's going to start

326
00:12:54,100 --> 00:13:00,129
getting hard and and and don't give up

327
00:12:57,159 --> 00:13:01,189
then because it's when your brain is

328
00:13:00,129 --> 00:13:03,948
search

329
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:06,560
for other words that don't come to mind

330
00:13:03,948 --> 00:13:09,708
quickly that you actually stumble across

331
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:11,179
really good names and so you want it you

332
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:14,088
want to press your mind you want to make

333
00:13:11,179 --> 00:13:15,919
your mind really work for these words so

334
00:13:14,089 --> 00:13:18,410
so the first time through you

335
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:20,688
brainstormed fifty descriptive words for

336
00:13:18,409 --> 00:13:22,490
what you do or cell and then and then

337
00:13:20,688 --> 00:13:25,309
the second part of it is that you

338
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:27,829
brainstorm another 50 words that you'd

339
00:13:25,309 --> 00:13:30,229
like your customers to use to describe

340
00:13:27,828 --> 00:13:33,588
you so now you've got two columns one

341
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:34,879
column is all about you know what you do

342
00:13:33,589 --> 00:13:36,529
what you're selling or what your service

343
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:38,149
is and the other one is descriptors and

344
00:13:36,528 --> 00:13:40,370
then you could just play with that

345
00:13:38,149 --> 00:13:43,220
massage those words back and forth and

346
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:44,740
and start to find well well what jumps

347
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:47,000
out to you what excites you what

348
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:49,579
combinations of words do you think are

349
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,208
cool and because you've pushed your mind

350
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:55,338
twice you're gonna have a lot of

351
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:57,229
unexpected words that that came to you

352
00:13:55,339 --> 00:14:00,110
after you've done your first you know 10

353
00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:03,019
or 12 and chances are you're gonna find

354
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:05,870
a lot of really interesting unexpected

355
00:14:03,019 --> 00:14:08,299
highways to go down and then and then

356
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:10,519
with all of those resources you have

357
00:14:08,299 --> 00:14:13,159
made mix and match them and and until

358
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:15,470
you have at least five acceptable names

359
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:17,568
right five names that you think okay I

360
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:19,399
could I could live with this name for a

361
00:14:17,568 --> 00:14:21,169
while don't just stick with the first

362
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:25,159
one because just because you've gotten

363
00:14:21,169 --> 00:14:27,349
one name that it is acceptable you know

364
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:28,850
the next one may actually be better and

365
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:30,860
you're gonna be you're gonna have this

366
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:32,420
name for a lot of years hopefully so you

367
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:33,169
want to make sure that you you pick a

368
00:14:32,419 --> 00:14:35,688
good one

369
00:14:33,169 --> 00:14:37,879
so do your brainstorming exercise mix

370
00:14:35,688 --> 00:14:40,299
and match the words make file at least

371
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:43,909
five acceptable names and then we go to

372
00:14:40,299 --> 00:14:45,528
category two which is social media so

373
00:14:43,909 --> 00:14:47,838
now that you you know got a name for

374
00:14:45,528 --> 00:14:50,448
yourself or at least a proposed list of

375
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:52,519
five names you need to really check your

376
00:14:50,448 --> 00:14:56,448
social media because it is going to be

377
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:59,058
forever a pain in the butt if if someone

378
00:14:56,448 --> 00:15:00,708
else has already got the social media

379
00:14:59,058 --> 00:15:02,750
handles that are the name of your

380
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:04,938
company you'll find that you're you're

381
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:07,818
having to do like an underscore in

382
00:15:04,938 --> 00:15:10,578
between them or do a weird spelling or

383
00:15:07,818 --> 00:15:13,129
man all that stuff really degrades your

384
00:15:10,578 --> 00:15:14,929
marketing and so after you've got your

385
00:15:13,129 --> 00:15:17,149
list of five acceptable name

386
00:15:14,929 --> 00:15:18,769
number one go and make sure you can get

387
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:21,079
the dough name domain name go make sure

388
00:15:18,769 --> 00:15:23,840
you can get the dot-com for it then go

389
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:27,500
check Instagram and Facebook and Twitter

390
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:31,120
and make sure that you can get the your

391
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:33,500
name the same in all of those places and

392
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,909
why this is so important is because you

393
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:37,309
know not only you want to be able to

394
00:15:34,909 --> 00:15:39,620
tell your customers where to go very

395
00:15:37,309 --> 00:15:42,859
easily but when you start printing up

396
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:46,039
flyers and and and printed materials

397
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:49,820
it's a it takes up a lot of space to

398
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:52,490
list four or five different social media

399
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:54,830
locations for yourself because your your

400
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:56,210
this on IG but your this different thing

401
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:58,220
on Facebook and then you've got a

402
00:15:56,210 --> 00:16:00,440
different domain name it just gets

403
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:03,860
really confusing so it's important

404
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:05,900
enough to pick a unique name that is

405
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:10,430
unique enough that you can pick it up in

406
00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:14,778
all of your social media uniquely and

407
00:16:10,429 --> 00:16:18,979
you know if someone is sitting on a name

408
00:16:14,778 --> 00:16:20,600
that you want to use say for example you

409
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:23,779
know on Twitter or something I mean

410
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:26,149
domain names are much more regulated so

411
00:16:23,779 --> 00:16:28,399
it's you can't really grab somebody's

412
00:16:26,149 --> 00:16:31,990
domain name but for Twitter for example

413
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:34,939
I was working with Gaja preneur calm and

414
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:38,210
somebody had been sitting on the twitter

415
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:40,010
handle ganja preneur but they hadn't

416
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:42,950
posted anything in two and a half years

417
00:16:40,009 --> 00:16:45,470
and so on their behalf i wrote to

418
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:47,390
twitter and i said hey you know this is

419
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:51,200
that this is our legitimate business

420
00:16:47,389 --> 00:16:52,970
name and and this cat has got this this

421
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:55,190
twitter account that says contra preneur

422
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:57,860
but he doesn't do anything with it right

423
00:16:55,190 --> 00:17:00,050
and he hasn't for years so how about you

424
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:01,550
consider taking it from him and giving

425
00:17:00,049 --> 00:17:03,979
it to us since it's our official

426
00:17:01,549 --> 00:17:06,678
business name Twitter people and they

427
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:09,588
said yeah right and so and so I was able

428
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:11,509
to you know capture that furred forg

429
00:17:09,588 --> 00:17:14,539
entrepreneurs so so if you've got a

430
00:17:11,509 --> 00:17:16,549
company and and and you can get the

431
00:17:14,539 --> 00:17:18,409
domain name and you can get a couple of

432
00:17:16,549 --> 00:17:20,899
the social medias but you can't get one

433
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:23,029
of them know that it is a possibility

434
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:25,069
that you could reach out to them and and

435
00:17:23,029 --> 00:17:27,210
and claim that you got this business

436
00:17:25,068 --> 00:17:30,720
and couldn't potentially

437
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:32,819
grab that that social media if somebody

438
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,799
is active on it that's probably way less

439
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:36,869
likely but if it's neglected it makes it

440
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:38,339
makes it really easy alright so that's

441
00:17:36,869 --> 00:17:40,559
the second category so first one is

442
00:17:38,339 --> 00:17:41,819
naming oh good well I just wanted to

443
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,559
jump in a little about naming cuz I

444
00:17:41,819 --> 00:17:46,589
think that's so important and I think

445
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:49,559
people under value it as exactly how

446
00:17:46,589 --> 00:17:52,559
much of a priority it is I can tell you

447
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:55,109
that when we first started my business

448
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:57,539
or I came into my parents business it

449
00:17:55,109 --> 00:18:01,079
was a compost tea brewing company and

450
00:17:57,539 --> 00:18:04,379
our name was simplicity but it was - TE

451
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:06,539
a witch from a dot-com perspective is

452
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:07,920
really tough so people had trouble

453
00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:09,559
finding the website right away my

454
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:12,180
parents didn't know anything about tech

455
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:15,000
you know this was back in 2000 when

456
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:18,090
comms weren't even really a thing but it

457
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:21,299
became a big challenge and as I've

458
00:18:18,089 --> 00:18:23,519
looked into naming future businesses and

459
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:25,200
ideas and products and things like that

460
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:28,109
I've had the opportunity to meet with

461
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:31,049
some really really amazing people on the

462
00:18:28,109 --> 00:18:32,519
marketing side and one of the things

463
00:18:31,049 --> 00:18:34,139
that they've they've taught me is sort

464
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:36,240
of take the values that are associated

465
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:37,860
with your product whatever your product

466
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,630
is whether it's cannabis or cannabis

467
00:18:37,859 --> 00:18:41,969
related you know fertilizer or something

468
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:43,440
and figure out what those values are and

469
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:45,569
then figure out how you can convey them

470
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,180
to that audience and you can do it by

471
00:18:45,569 --> 00:18:50,099
making word-association you like

472
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:52,410
creating an association like Apple for

473
00:18:50,099 --> 00:18:55,709
example or Amazon there was no

474
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:57,420
association with the company week they

475
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:59,579
created that so now when you hear the

476
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:02,190
word Apple you think of you know these

477
00:18:59,579 --> 00:19:04,289
technology and an iPhone and and with

478
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:06,000
Amazon you think of an online on the

479
00:19:04,289 --> 00:19:07,920
online store so there they were able to

480
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,289
create that Association out of nowhere

481
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:13,440
through marketing and branding or you

482
00:19:10,289 --> 00:19:15,569
can take something you can try and use

483
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,880
the name I love the stuff by Jonah

484
00:19:15,569 --> 00:19:19,799
Berger have you ever read contagious no

485
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,660
I haven't oh it's this awesome book you

486
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:23,970
can I'll put a link on the podcast page

487
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:26,360
for people he has a lot of YouTube talks

488
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:28,380
the guy's amazing

489
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:30,349
and one things he talks about was he

490
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:32,720
actually came up with the name Swiffer

491
00:19:30,349 --> 00:19:35,519
which was you know they had this mop

492
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:38,029
thing for cleaning dust off of floors

493
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:40,289
and so they were like what kind of words

494
00:19:38,029 --> 00:19:41,089
sound like when you hear the word

495
00:19:40,289 --> 00:19:43,190
Swiffer when you

496
00:19:41,089 --> 00:19:46,069
you think well it sounds like Swift so

497
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:47,539
it sounds fast you hear that this fuss

498
00:19:46,069 --> 00:19:50,179
sound in the middle which sort of makes

499
00:19:47,539 --> 00:19:53,509
you think of like moving a mop along the

500
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:55,160
floor and they used a made-up word that

501
00:19:53,509 --> 00:19:56,569
already had associations that you

502
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:59,300
weren't even really aware of in your

503
00:19:56,569 --> 00:20:01,369
brain around this product and they did

504
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:02,720
the same thing with Febreze and I just

505
00:20:01,369 --> 00:20:05,750
thought that was really interesting way

506
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:08,630
of approaching naming that was really

507
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:10,519
successful yeah and I love any kind of a

508
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:14,300
name where you can get onomatopoeia like

509
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:17,450
that where the the name sounds like the

510
00:20:14,299 --> 00:20:20,299
the service or device that's always fun

511
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:22,850
to it gives a it gives a extra set of of

512
00:20:20,299 --> 00:20:24,319
character to your company and people can

513
00:20:22,849 --> 00:20:27,379
put it together I got two other things

514
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:29,960
to hit on to that that idea of of making

515
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:32,270
a name like Apple that that doesn't mean

516
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:34,640
anything in technology until you make it

517
00:20:32,269 --> 00:20:37,129
say that that goes further the same with

518
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:39,320
my podcast right shaping fire I mean

519
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:42,020
that doesn't really mean anything to

520
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:45,259
most people and and and once people

521
00:20:42,019 --> 00:20:47,960
become aware of of both the shaping fire

522
00:20:45,259 --> 00:20:50,509
podcast and our popular YouTube channel

523
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:52,340
then people are like oh yeah you know I

524
00:20:50,509 --> 00:20:55,069
know what shaping fire is but but we

525
00:20:52,339 --> 00:20:58,579
have you know imbued that instilled

526
00:20:55,069 --> 00:21:01,309
meaning into shaping fire what nobody

527
00:20:58,579 --> 00:21:03,169
knows though is that when I was coming

528
00:21:01,309 --> 00:21:05,690
up with it I did the I actually did the

529
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:08,240
brainstorming exercises that I had just

530
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:10,309
been just talking about and more right I

531
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,980
did you know my naming process took

532
00:21:10,309 --> 00:21:15,019
about eight weeks and and I came up with

533
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:16,849
about ten names in the end that I liked

534
00:21:15,019 --> 00:21:19,549
and it was finally shaping fire that I

535
00:21:16,849 --> 00:21:21,349
stopped on and for me the shaping fire

536
00:21:19,549 --> 00:21:22,990
the name has always been about you know

537
00:21:21,349 --> 00:21:25,459
there's this this normalization

538
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:29,150
legalization taxation thing that's

539
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:31,370
taking off and and cannabis industry has

540
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:34,250
now become this this wildfire and it's

541
00:21:31,369 --> 00:21:36,949
chaotic and it's and it's both creating

542
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:40,069
and destroying at the same time and so

543
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:42,860
through good quality education which I

544
00:21:40,069 --> 00:21:45,439
aim to provide both on the podcast and

545
00:21:42,859 --> 00:21:48,139
on the YouTube channel we are shaping

546
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,450
this fire we're in and you know we're

547
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:53,690
sculpting it into something that has

548
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:54,880
meaning and and so anyway so that's

549
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:56,200
where I came from

550
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,650
another thing you were talking about -

551
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:04,000
you said simplicity right and so you're

552
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:05,530
taking a word simplicity that is in the

553
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,160
dictionary and replacing it with

554
00:22:05,529 --> 00:22:13,180
something that it's like a homonym like

555
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:15,910
simplicity te a and and I generally

556
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:18,370
suggest people avoid those because

557
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:21,430
they're easy for people to not be able

558
00:22:18,369 --> 00:22:23,169
to find you when they search for you one

559
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:24,580
of my good friends did that recently and

560
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:26,860
he jokes about it all the time when he

561
00:22:24,579 --> 00:22:29,829
does interviews Patrick from green

562
00:22:26,859 --> 00:22:33,519
bicycles he puts together a great

563
00:22:29,829 --> 00:22:36,579
compost tea and and and and soil

564
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:41,170
amendments but but green bicycles is gr

565
00:22:36,579 --> 00:22:43,269
e a n and so you know this was a

566
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:45,100
decision he made early on in his process

567
00:22:43,269 --> 00:22:47,019
and he's gone with it and he always

568
00:22:45,099 --> 00:22:48,669
jokes about how it's a hassle now to

569
00:22:47,019 --> 00:22:51,099
always have to explain people to people

570
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:53,890
that green is not the color green it's

571
00:22:51,099 --> 00:22:56,829
as grea and even though all of his

572
00:22:53,890 --> 00:23:00,310
marketing really uses the color green so

573
00:22:56,829 --> 00:23:03,549
so I caution people to to really focus

574
00:23:00,309 --> 00:23:06,970
on words that when people hear it they

575
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:08,440
will understand how to spell it that's a

576
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:11,829
great point that's a really great point

577
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:13,570
and what's funny is when I when I heard

578
00:23:11,829 --> 00:23:15,789
shaping fire well one thing I love about

579
00:23:13,569 --> 00:23:18,579
that is if you type shaping fire into

580
00:23:15,789 --> 00:23:20,049
Google they're gonna find you yeah which

581
00:23:18,579 --> 00:23:23,049
is really really nice it's it's very

582
00:23:20,049 --> 00:23:24,639
very intentional and very easy to spell

583
00:23:23,049 --> 00:23:26,769
everyone can spell the word shaping in

584
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,720
the word fire it's not challenging for

585
00:23:26,769 --> 00:23:30,339
someone to spell that but I thought it

586
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,170
was because I was seeing on Instagram

587
00:23:30,339 --> 00:23:34,659
everyone you know when someone puts up a

588
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:36,580
good bud or a flower picture they always

589
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:38,860
did people would use the fire emoji or

590
00:23:36,579 --> 00:23:42,429
say it was fire so I thought you were

591
00:23:38,859 --> 00:23:45,069
using that sort of slang term that had

592
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:47,259
become popular in cannabis culture as

593
00:23:45,069 --> 00:23:50,079
the way of saying like shaping fire like

594
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:51,549
growing top-shelf cannabis which is

595
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:52,720
interesting because up until now I

596
00:23:51,549 --> 00:23:55,180
didn't realize you had a totally

597
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:57,279
different meaning around your pot it

598
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:59,200
certainly wasn't lost on me when I chose

599
00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:01,119
the name that it had these multiple

600
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:04,630
meanings in our scene that's for sure

601
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:06,909
right and a fire is a word that people

602
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:08,470
in our scene you know embrace readily

603
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:10,120
and it's a good thing it's a good to

604
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:12,610
scriptor so I mean I wouldn't have

605
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:14,229
called the show like you know shaping

606
00:24:12,609 --> 00:24:17,109
larf you know what I mean

607
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:20,169
you know I would a having it come

608
00:24:17,109 --> 00:24:22,269
together like that was important but

609
00:24:20,169 --> 00:24:25,120
yeah what was not the initial intent

610
00:24:22,269 --> 00:24:26,740
anyway all right so talk to me you were

611
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:29,229
you were on social media I think when I

612
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:31,240
interrupted you there yeah so so we did

613
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:32,950
naming and we did social media because

614
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:34,210
we want to make sure that your your your

615
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:36,190
company is set up to win from the

616
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:38,919
beginning and then the third one is

617
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:41,380
trademark and and I always recommend

618
00:24:38,919 --> 00:24:43,299
people to trademark early as soon as

619
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:46,929
you've decided what your name is really

620
00:24:43,298 --> 00:24:49,150
gonna be go ahead and immediately

621
00:24:46,929 --> 00:24:51,929
trademark as much as you can now if you

622
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:56,380
if you are a farm and you are selling

623
00:24:51,929 --> 00:25:00,220
cannabis the USPTO will not give you a

624
00:24:56,380 --> 00:25:01,840
trademark for selling cannabis we're

625
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:05,288
still waiting on that to be legally

626
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:07,269
possible but perhaps you could you could

627
00:25:05,288 --> 00:25:09,429
start your trademark by trademarking

628
00:25:07,269 --> 00:25:12,009
your name and your ability to make

629
00:25:09,429 --> 00:25:14,500
t-shirts with it right or your ability

630
00:25:12,009 --> 00:25:17,548
to consult with it and so you start

631
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:20,109
building up this legal history of

632
00:25:17,548 --> 00:25:23,408
relationship of you and that name and

633
00:25:20,109 --> 00:25:25,750
and that you're using it publicly now if

634
00:25:23,409 --> 00:25:28,690
you are in the cannabis industry but

635
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:30,730
you're in a non regulated product say

636
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:32,470
for example you know bongs and rolling

637
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:33,880
papers or or whatever you know something

638
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:36,038
something that's not regulated by the

639
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:38,890
state then you can go ahead and

640
00:25:36,038 --> 00:25:40,808
trademark right away and and you should

641
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:43,870
do that right away because there's never

642
00:25:40,808 --> 00:25:46,058
been so many people starting cannabis

643
00:25:43,869 --> 00:25:48,548
related companies as there are right now

644
00:25:46,058 --> 00:25:51,129
and the chance that you know if your

645
00:25:48,548 --> 00:25:53,079
company is in Florida that somebody else

646
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:55,659
in Connecticut is going to come up with

647
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:58,599
the same idea it's very likely

648
00:25:55,659 --> 00:26:00,880
especially since the lexicon of cannabis

649
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:05,139
words is actually surprisingly small and

650
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:07,600
so you know if you you know if you're a

651
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:10,030
technical kind of person you know

652
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:14,619
certainly you can file your trademark on

653
00:26:10,029 --> 00:26:17,859
your own but I'm a big fan of having

654
00:26:14,619 --> 00:26:20,529
legal help and you know you could you

655
00:26:17,859 --> 00:26:22,240
can get into a trademark attorney you

656
00:26:20,529 --> 00:26:25,058
know for as little as probably 800

657
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:27,819
bucks to be able to get your initial

658
00:26:25,058 --> 00:26:29,829
trademark placed so it's on the books

659
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:32,710
and if you're taking this game seriously

660
00:26:29,829 --> 00:26:35,399
spending 800 bucks on a trademark should

661
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:37,690
be probably be considered a reasonable

662
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:40,929
expense to protect your company's

663
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:43,900
identity so so yeah so that's that's a

664
00:26:40,929 --> 00:26:46,450
that's a short area trademark but but do

665
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:49,780
it swiftly as soon as you have decided

666
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:52,808
on a name so then the the next category

667
00:26:49,779 --> 00:26:54,849
is is what I call a thin slicing and and

668
00:26:52,808 --> 00:26:57,250
for for for folks who are listening who

669
00:26:54,849 --> 00:26:59,919
have grown up with the internet this

670
00:26:57,250 --> 00:27:01,960
will be like a duh but for but there was

671
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:04,269
a time before the internet and and if

672
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:07,240
you were gonna open a company you

673
00:27:04,269 --> 00:27:09,549
normally had a storefront and I think

674
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:11,230
that for most companies I mean unless

675
00:27:09,549 --> 00:27:13,539
you're you're opening a retail shop

676
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:17,230
right when so that the whole point is

677
00:27:13,539 --> 00:27:20,200
having a storefront I'm a big fan of

678
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:22,089
Internet only companies because you

679
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,860
don't have to pay the overhead for a

680
00:27:22,089 --> 00:27:27,069
retail space you don't have to pay the

681
00:27:23,859 --> 00:27:30,909
overhead for the labor you don't have to

682
00:27:27,069 --> 00:27:34,089
deal with municipal bans on cannabis

683
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:36,220
companies and and you get to take

684
00:27:34,089 --> 00:27:38,678
advantage of what's called thin slicing

685
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:40,600
because in your you know let's say that

686
00:27:38,679 --> 00:27:42,160
you live in a small town somewhere and

687
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:44,889
you've got you've come up with this

688
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:46,929
really cool product there may only be a

689
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:49,690
couple hundred to a couple thousand

690
00:27:46,929 --> 00:27:52,030
people in your immediate area of driving

691
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:54,308
distance who will drive to your store

692
00:27:52,029 --> 00:27:56,170
and buy whatever it is that you're

693
00:27:54,308 --> 00:27:58,058
selling but if you're selling it on the

694
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:59,860
Internet and now everyone is you know

695
00:27:58,058 --> 00:28:01,329
pretty comfortable with e-commerce and

696
00:27:59,859 --> 00:28:03,759
putting their credit cards online and

697
00:28:01,329 --> 00:28:06,428
all that kind of stuff you get to thin

698
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:08,829
slice the entirety of the country

699
00:28:06,429 --> 00:28:11,620
whereas locally there might only be a

700
00:28:08,829 --> 00:28:14,379
few people who want your product if you

701
00:28:11,619 --> 00:28:16,479
take the entire country there's plenty

702
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:20,260
of people to keep your company and float

703
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:22,179
and doing well and you know one of those

704
00:28:20,259 --> 00:28:25,808
folks who I think has done a good job of

705
00:28:22,179 --> 00:28:28,210
it is Alan Atkinson at crow Kashi right

706
00:28:25,808 --> 00:28:29,920
Alan does not do a lot of marketing

707
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:32,740
right he's he doesn't do a lot of

708
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:35,500
marketing and and if anything his

709
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:36,009
biggest marketing is probably being The

710
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:38,170
Cove

711
00:28:36,009 --> 00:28:40,660
founder of probiotic farmers alliance

712
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:43,690
and his leadership there tends to lead

713
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:45,150
people to his product crow Kashi but the

714
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:49,779
thing is is that there are enough people

715
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:52,390
across the country that hear his message

716
00:28:49,779 --> 00:28:56,109
about Gro Kashi and then can buy it on

717
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:58,240
the line online way more people than

718
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:59,889
there are in Laytonsville even though

719
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,269
that's a hotbed of cannabis growing

720
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:02,530
right I'm not I'm certainly not

721
00:29:01,269 --> 00:29:04,509
belittling that there's a ton of

722
00:29:02,529 --> 00:29:07,180
cannabis being growing there but there's

723
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:10,210
only so many people in Laytonsville the

724
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:12,910
fact that he's able to thin slice this

725
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:16,980
national market and sell to all those

726
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:19,990
people he gets to access a nationwide

727
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:22,150
consumer pool without having to have

728
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:25,000
retail shops all across the country and

729
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:28,870
it works out really well to his Vantage

730
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:31,660
so so consider thin slicing and and and

731
00:29:28,869 --> 00:29:33,129
and being an internet company and if you

732
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:35,529
and if you're thinking about owning a

733
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:38,110
retail opening a retail store you know

734
00:29:35,529 --> 00:29:39,460
make sure make sure you are clear in

735
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:43,419
your head that your business model

736
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:45,009
demands that so then similarly and then

737
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:47,769
this is the this is the last of the five

738
00:29:45,009 --> 00:29:51,420
categories is um start using tech

739
00:29:47,769 --> 00:29:54,220
marketing as fast as you can for example

740
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:56,170
right away as soon as as soon as even

741
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:58,809
you have a placeholder on your website

742
00:29:56,170 --> 00:30:01,769
before you've even launched make sure

743
00:29:58,809 --> 00:30:05,259
you integrate integrate some kind of

744
00:30:01,769 --> 00:30:07,660
like MailChimp newsletter to capture

745
00:30:05,259 --> 00:30:10,089
emails because sometimes people come to

746
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:13,000
your your website once but they won't

747
00:30:10,089 --> 00:30:15,279
ever come again and so if they come once

748
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,539
it's shown enough interest and if

749
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:18,970
they're willing to give you their email

750
00:30:16,539 --> 00:30:20,409
address now you can reach them again

751
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:22,600
when you actually go through your

752
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:24,610
product launch and any future product

753
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:28,599
launches and you can start to develop a

754
00:30:24,609 --> 00:30:30,849
relationship with them so so capturing

755
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:34,689
emails with MailChimp it's it's free

756
00:30:30,849 --> 00:30:36,730
it's very easy to use and then you can

757
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:39,279
start building customer loyalty programs

758
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:40,930
based on your newsletter and and you

759
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:42,940
know creating original content for that

760
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:44,920
newsletter that causes people to share

761
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:48,250
it with their friends and this is all

762
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:49,420
very low-priced marketing that is very

763
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:51,460
valuable when you're

764
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:53,710
starting out before you're actually

765
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:56,019
creating revenue and then there are some

766
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:57,549
other really good high-quality tech

767
00:30:56,019 --> 00:30:59,920
marketing tools out there like the

768
00:30:57,549 --> 00:31:01,839
Facebook pixel right I mean one of the

769
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:05,110
greatest tools that we've got for

770
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:08,019
marketing in cannabis you know even

771
00:31:05,109 --> 00:31:12,369
though Instagram and Facebook make it

772
00:31:08,019 --> 00:31:14,470
difficult to mint to market cannabis

773
00:31:12,369 --> 00:31:16,509
related products if you take your time

774
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:19,089
and you massage your messaging and you

775
00:31:16,509 --> 00:31:21,549
don't have pictures of cannabis in your

776
00:31:19,089 --> 00:31:23,169
ad you can actually make it work and

777
00:31:21,549 --> 00:31:25,839
then you boost those and they're your

778
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:28,360
return on that kind of marketing is

779
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:30,309
really good if you take the time to

780
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:33,309
write it in a way that you can kind of

781
00:31:30,309 --> 00:31:35,109
disco around their rules and so then you

782
00:31:33,309 --> 00:31:38,500
can use what's called a Facebook pixel

783
00:31:35,109 --> 00:31:41,259
and it tracks everybody who who clicks

784
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:43,569
on your ad and go to your website and so

785
00:31:41,259 --> 00:31:45,129
you can remark it to them later so if

786
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:47,349
you're not familiar with the Facebook

787
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:49,240
pixel you should look into that and then

788
00:31:47,349 --> 00:31:50,230
there's there's there's all sorts of you

789
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,789
know different technology where my

790
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:55,420
favorites is actually called hot jar

791
00:31:51,789 --> 00:31:58,539
it's pretty cool it tracks the movement

792
00:31:55,420 --> 00:32:00,910
of people on your website so let's say

793
00:31:58,539 --> 00:32:02,680
that you've got an online store and and

794
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:05,410
you're not getting the the number of

795
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:07,690
sales that you want for the amount of

796
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:09,400
people who are coming to your site so

797
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:11,650
let's say that you have a high bounce

798
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:13,269
rate people come but they don't buy well

799
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:15,519
it would sure be great to know what

800
00:32:13,269 --> 00:32:16,990
they're doing on their on your website

801
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:18,519
while they're there maybe they're

802
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:21,250
getting lost maybe they don't understand

803
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:24,639
how it works and so this this service

804
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:26,980
called hot jar actually records video

805
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:29,950
records everybody who comes to your site

806
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:33,099
and so you know whenever you want to you

807
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:36,370
can log in and and watch each user's

808
00:32:33,099 --> 00:32:38,619
session and track where they're moving

809
00:32:36,369 --> 00:32:41,969
around it gives you a heat map for the

810
00:32:38,619 --> 00:32:46,569
website and you may find out that that

811
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:49,329
people are confusing you know your your

812
00:32:46,569 --> 00:32:51,339
catalog with your shopping cart or or

813
00:32:49,329 --> 00:32:52,689
maybe they're coming you're they're

814
00:32:51,339 --> 00:32:54,819
coming to their website and and you're

815
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:56,860
expecting them to go to the the store

816
00:32:54,819 --> 00:32:58,929
part but maybe they're going and getting

817
00:32:56,859 --> 00:32:59,919
distracted by your blog and your videos

818
00:32:58,930 --> 00:33:01,420
and they're spending all their time

819
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,740
there and they're forgetting to go back

820
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:04,990
to the store

821
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:07,870
so so hot jars another great technology

822
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:09,940
too and you know often it's worth it to

823
00:33:07,869 --> 00:33:12,549
bring on an expert at this point because

824
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:15,130
you know if you're in cannabis chances

825
00:33:12,549 --> 00:33:17,259
are you're focused on the operations and

826
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:20,740
horticulture of growing your cannabis

827
00:33:17,259 --> 00:33:22,750
and if you are manufacturing or curating

828
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:24,640
products for sale that's probably where

829
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:27,369
your expertise is and you're working on

830
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:30,490
that and you know for example myself

831
00:33:27,369 --> 00:33:33,189
even you know I know that my tech

832
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:37,150
marketing has to happen but really what

833
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:39,070
I enjoy most is is is reaching out to

834
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:40,630
industry experts and then chatting with

835
00:33:39,069 --> 00:33:43,178
them and then going into conventions

836
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:44,740
that's what I like to do and so you know

837
00:33:43,179 --> 00:33:47,440
you might want to add somebody who's a

838
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:49,750
specialist like like I hired blunt

839
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:52,240
branding and so you know I work with

840
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:54,099
Kirsten Nelson at blunt branding to

841
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,900
sculpt my message and I'm like okay this

842
00:33:54,099 --> 00:33:58,389
is what I want to say and this is how I

843
00:33:55,900 --> 00:34:01,240
want to say it and then she'll take it

844
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:02,890
and and plug it into all this kind of

845
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:06,190
the technology and a Facebook pixel

846
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:07,720
she'll deploy it and and then and then I

847
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:09,940
can just go back to doing the things

848
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:11,740
that I like to do now granted bringing

849
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:14,079
somebody on like that

850
00:34:11,739 --> 00:34:15,309
you either want to you know you want to

851
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:19,000
make sure you negotiate something that

852
00:34:15,309 --> 00:34:21,039
you can afford dollar-wise but the

853
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,750
amount of time that it frees you up is

854
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:24,460
really helpful especially if you don't

855
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:26,619
know how all this technology crap works

856
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:27,970
the first place you know if this is not

857
00:34:26,619 --> 00:34:29,320
your if your this is not your

858
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:32,079
bread-and-butter you're gonna spend so

859
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:33,609
much time learning the technology that

860
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:35,679
you might as well you know get somebody

861
00:34:33,608 --> 00:34:37,449
at the beginning so so those are the

862
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:40,059
five categories that I always start with

863
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:42,608
my with my clients to to you know

864
00:34:40,059 --> 00:34:44,230
brainstorm and get a name make sure it's

865
00:34:42,608 --> 00:34:47,128
available throughout social media and

866
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:51,909
domain trade market as soon as you can

867
00:34:47,128 --> 00:34:54,279
lean towards a thin slicing internet

868
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:56,260
company with less overhead and start

869
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:59,430
using technology marketing apps as soon

870
00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:02,260
as possible so that you can track and

871
00:34:59,429 --> 00:35:05,108
you know get into relationship with the

872
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:07,270
people who come to you that's great I

873
00:35:05,108 --> 00:35:10,869
agree with everything you just said and

874
00:35:07,269 --> 00:35:13,900
I know that you had some company

875
00:35:10,869 --> 00:35:15,910
examples to sort of highlight some of

876
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:16,240
these principles do you want to touch on

877
00:35:15,909 --> 00:35:17,319
some of

878
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:20,319
right now I know you already mentioned

879
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:21,789
green bicycles for the naming was there

880
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:24,550
was there some other things he had in

881
00:35:21,789 --> 00:35:26,199
mind in that regard well sure I mean as

882
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:27,580
far as as far as that goes I mean there

883
00:35:26,199 --> 00:35:31,059
are some folks that do it really well

884
00:35:27,579 --> 00:35:32,679
like our mutual friend Jeremy Silva

885
00:35:31,059 --> 00:35:34,929
right over at build of soil he does a

886
00:35:32,679 --> 00:35:37,779
great job about this right I mean he's

887
00:35:34,929 --> 00:35:42,250
got he's got a unique name that's really

888
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:43,660
easy to say really easy to spell and he

889
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:46,599
does he does

890
00:35:43,659 --> 00:35:48,759
you know he's creating new content on

891
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:50,829
Instagram all the time like I you know I

892
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:55,360
can't be the only one who loves watching

893
00:35:50,829 --> 00:35:56,799
him grow he does like a be testing with

894
00:35:55,360 --> 00:36:01,480
different with different growing

895
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:04,600
supplies in an in - 4x4 tents that are

896
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:07,900
in his shop and you know he's creating

897
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:10,809
original content and and people know him

898
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:14,619
as a human but then they also know his

899
00:36:10,809 --> 00:36:16,360
company as curating good products and so

900
00:36:14,619 --> 00:36:18,940
you know he's one person that does it

901
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:20,289
really well um can we another we talk

902
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:21,760
about Jeremy for a second cuz there's

903
00:36:20,289 --> 00:36:24,159
some things I want to highlight that

904
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:27,580
that I thought he did a great job on -

905
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:30,309
is I met Jeremy you know digitally in

906
00:36:27,579 --> 00:36:33,159
the IC mag forum for organic soil I

907
00:36:30,309 --> 00:36:36,190
don't even know how long ago and at this

908
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:38,529
point I I'd found it or started kiss

909
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:40,990
organics build a soil was wasn't even

910
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:43,570
around yet and so we were selling these

911
00:36:40,989 --> 00:36:46,868
amendments online but I was not doing

912
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:49,030
any marketing and then one day a banner

913
00:36:46,869 --> 00:36:52,059
ad for build the soil showed up on the

914
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:54,640
IC Meg forum for organic soil and he was

915
00:36:52,059 --> 00:36:56,650
sponsoring that for him and that was you

916
00:36:54,639 --> 00:36:57,759
know people started talking about it he

917
00:36:56,650 --> 00:37:01,450
probably didn't pay that much for the

918
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:04,660
banner in the first place but he was he

919
00:37:01,449 --> 00:37:06,159
was really a marketing guy and what he

920
00:37:04,659 --> 00:37:08,469
did was he built this idea around

921
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:10,659
amendments by taking the information he

922
00:37:08,469 --> 00:37:12,608
was learning on IC meg and putting it on

923
00:37:10,659 --> 00:37:14,139
his website in the blog and sharing the

924
00:37:12,608 --> 00:37:15,909
things that people like Clackamas coot

925
00:37:14,139 --> 00:37:17,559
were saying and and sharing these

926
00:37:15,909 --> 00:37:20,230
recipes and just simplifying the

927
00:37:17,559 --> 00:37:21,579
information so what he did was say hey

928
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:24,490
I'm gonna give you all this information

929
00:37:21,579 --> 00:37:26,139
for free and a lot of these these

930
00:37:24,489 --> 00:37:27,699
products that this information talks

931
00:37:26,139 --> 00:37:28,539
about are going to be available on our

932
00:37:27,699 --> 00:37:32,199
website

933
00:37:28,539 --> 00:37:34,989
and the other thing that I think Jeremy

934
00:37:32,199 --> 00:37:36,759
did a great job of was he focused on one

935
00:37:34,989 --> 00:37:39,069
social media platform and that has been

936
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:40,960
very consistent with it they have 20 or

937
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:43,870
30 thousand followers now on Instagram

938
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:45,490
and what he's done there is he's been

939
00:37:43,869 --> 00:37:47,079
very consistent about his posting and

940
00:37:45,489 --> 00:37:49,719
it's something that I am terrible at but

941
00:37:47,079 --> 00:37:52,239
rather than him diluting is his time by

942
00:37:49,719 --> 00:37:54,099
posting on Facebook and Instagram or

943
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:55,689
these other markets he's picked the one

944
00:37:54,099 --> 00:37:58,690
that he thought was most relevant to

945
00:37:55,690 --> 00:38:00,820
growers which was Instagram and then has

946
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:03,130
really stuck with it like you said

947
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:04,840
sharing all that information but he's

948
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:07,900
also created this sort of lifestyle

949
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:10,530
brand around him and his company where

950
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:13,450
it's not all of this post or not about

951
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:14,830
just about cannabis or about product and

952
00:38:13,449 --> 00:38:16,659
there is a lot of stuff that he puts up

953
00:38:14,829 --> 00:38:19,179
about his products and deals and that

954
00:38:16,659 --> 00:38:21,750
sort of thing but he also you know talks

955
00:38:19,179 --> 00:38:24,819
about his girlfriend's hip surgery and

956
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:27,340
the martial arts that he's doing and the

957
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:29,140
his his pet pig and other things in his

958
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:31,360
life that make you feel a little more

959
00:38:29,139 --> 00:38:32,980
connected to the person and the business

960
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:37,870
that you're you know you're contributing

961
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:39,789
- yeah for sure I mean the whole build

962
00:38:37,869 --> 00:38:42,190
of soil brand just screams authenticity

963
00:38:39,789 --> 00:38:44,050
right I mean he's the kind of guy when

964
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:46,720
you run into him at Emerald cup or or

965
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:48,610
locally there in Colorado you're you're

966
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:50,589
happy to run into him not because he's a

967
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:52,360
successful business owner necessarily

968
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:54,840
but just because he's a nice guy and you

969
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:58,240
know I gotta say that probably applies

970
00:38:54,840 --> 00:39:01,600
equally to you tad because you know you

971
00:38:58,239 --> 00:39:05,349
run a similar type business and and you

972
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:08,679
also provide a lot of value through your

973
00:39:05,349 --> 00:39:11,019
podcast which then drives traffic to the

974
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:13,809
keep it simple website where you are

975
00:39:11,019 --> 00:39:15,880
able to provide these these amendments

976
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:18,789
as well and I would say also you are

977
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:21,960
also a likable guy right and so I would

978
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:25,449
I would say that the idea of of you know

979
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:28,179
not being plasticky corporate and

980
00:39:25,449 --> 00:39:30,250
instead kind of like letting that veil

981
00:39:28,179 --> 00:39:33,609
between your business and your personal

982
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:35,500
life be a little bit transparent I think

983
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:37,180
that it creates customer loyalty because

984
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:40,329
you know there's a reason why we all

985
00:39:37,179 --> 00:39:42,269
push back against like you know better

986
00:39:40,329 --> 00:39:45,000
months with no personality

987
00:39:42,269 --> 00:39:46,889
miracle-gro right it's it's because it's

988
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:51,090
it's a bunch of c-suite executives

989
00:39:46,889 --> 00:39:52,769
behind it and not some person who you

990
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:55,410
know we'd want to sit down and talk with

991
00:39:52,769 --> 00:39:57,150
and and I think that's a good thing and

992
00:39:55,409 --> 00:39:58,909
sounds like we both agree that that

993
00:39:57,150 --> 00:40:01,170
Jeremy's done a really good job of that

994
00:39:58,909 --> 00:40:02,759
yeah I want to highlight too

995
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:05,670
something that was really tough for me

996
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:09,330
when I first got into business or having

997
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:11,940
a product in a market was I spent a lot

998
00:40:09,329 --> 00:40:13,529
of time noticing other competitors

999
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:15,480
things they were doing right things they

1000
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:16,950
were doing wrong information that they

1001
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:18,750
were sharing that was just blatantly

1002
00:40:16,949 --> 00:40:21,869
inaccurate and I would get really angry

1003
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:25,650
and I'd get caught up but focusing more

1004
00:40:21,869 --> 00:40:27,029
on them in their product then what I was

1005
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:28,769
doing with my own business and it was

1006
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:30,900
totally the wrong approach

1007
00:40:28,769 --> 00:40:32,550
since then I've really learned that a

1008
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:34,559
lot of times you can collaborate with

1009
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:35,880
people and realistically it's important

1010
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:38,519
to be aware of what other people are

1011
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:40,410
doing in your industry but it doesn't it

1012
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:43,469
doesn't and shouldn't be the focus of

1013
00:40:40,409 --> 00:40:45,659
your time and your energy like Jeremy is

1014
00:40:43,469 --> 00:40:47,129
probably my biggest online competitor

1015
00:40:45,659 --> 00:40:48,750
when it comes to selling products and

1016
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:51,059
I'm talking about him on my podcast

1017
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:53,639
but at the same time I'm also you know

1018
00:40:51,059 --> 00:40:55,259
I've established a good working

1019
00:40:53,639 --> 00:40:56,549
relationship with Jeremy even though

1020
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:58,350
we've never met in person but we've

1021
00:40:56,550 --> 00:41:00,269
talked on the phone a lot you know we

1022
00:40:58,349 --> 00:41:02,339
get along great and I wish him the best

1023
00:41:00,269 --> 00:41:04,619
and I'm hoping I can collaborate with

1024
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:05,610
him in the future because we can only

1025
00:41:04,619 --> 00:41:07,980
become stronger through these

1026
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:11,220
partnerships it doesn't have to be this

1027
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:13,019
antagonistic relationship and you know

1028
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:14,459
like you mentioned green bicycles well

1029
00:41:13,019 --> 00:41:16,650
we started as a compost tea business

1030
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:19,679
compost tea is still a big part of our

1031
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:21,480
business but yet I realize there's other

1032
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:24,449
people out there that may be doing as

1033
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:26,400
good or better job as well in in the

1034
00:41:24,449 --> 00:41:27,329
industry so it's I think it's one of

1035
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,210
those things we just need to recognize

1036
00:41:27,329 --> 00:41:31,590
is that we don't have to focus on what

1037
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:32,970
other people are doing but really focus

1038
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:35,730
on what we're doing and find ways to

1039
00:41:32,969 --> 00:41:37,619
collaborate with people yeah I think you

1040
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:39,869
make two really solid points there the

1041
00:41:37,619 --> 00:41:44,009
first one about watching what everybody

1042
00:41:39,869 --> 00:41:47,940
else is doing there are so many people

1043
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:52,320
doing so many businesses and they do it

1044
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:55,740
in competitive combative ways that I

1045
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:59,100
would find that I find frustrating

1046
00:41:55,739 --> 00:42:01,529
antagonizing that I find when when I

1047
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:03,868
focus on what everybody else is doing in

1048
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:06,420
the industry I get so upset and stressed

1049
00:42:03,869 --> 00:42:10,700
out that I have a hard time taking care

1050
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:16,230
of my own business and and similarly I

1051
00:42:10,699 --> 00:42:18,210
want to do my podcast and my youtube

1052
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:20,730
channel in my way and so people are

1053
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:22,440
often talking to me like hey did you you

1054
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:24,510
know listen to this particular podcast

1055
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:26,190
or this particular podcast and people

1056
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:28,770
are often surprised when I say you know

1057
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:30,720
I only really listen to like three or

1058
00:42:28,769 --> 00:42:34,579
four podcasts you know and there there's

1059
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:37,829
probably easily 30 that are popular in

1060
00:42:34,579 --> 00:42:40,829
in cannabis right now but I don't listen

1061
00:42:37,829 --> 00:42:43,259
to them all because mostly I'm focused

1062
00:42:40,829 --> 00:42:45,389
on keeping my head down taking care of

1063
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:47,700
my own business and doing my things the

1064
00:42:45,389 --> 00:42:49,559
way that I want to instead of feeling

1065
00:42:47,699 --> 00:42:51,509
like I need to know what what what

1066
00:42:49,559 --> 00:42:53,400
everybody else is doing to replicate

1067
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:54,810
because normally I don't want to

1068
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:56,970
replicate with anybody else's doing

1069
00:42:54,809 --> 00:42:58,710
anyway I want to do things in my way and

1070
00:42:56,969 --> 00:43:02,579
so I think I think that's a really good

1071
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:04,800
point that you have to don't worry what

1072
00:43:02,579 --> 00:43:06,750
everybody else is doing like if you want

1073
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:09,240
to if you want to drop in and follow

1074
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:11,099
somebody for a little while so that you

1075
00:43:09,239 --> 00:43:12,868
can learn you know some of their secrets

1076
00:43:11,099 --> 00:43:14,279
and then you can cross apply those

1077
00:43:12,869 --> 00:43:17,280
secrets to how you're doing business

1078
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:20,340
like for example you know really smart

1079
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:22,220
growers go and tour their competitors

1080
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:24,869
grows if they can get into them right

1081
00:43:22,219 --> 00:43:26,309
because they can learn best practices

1082
00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:28,350
from other people and then bring them

1083
00:43:26,309 --> 00:43:30,358
home to themselves now that kind of

1084
00:43:28,349 --> 00:43:33,019
research and development is really smart

1085
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:35,279
but to sit on social media and be

1086
00:43:33,019 --> 00:43:38,309
obsessing about what other people are

1087
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:41,550
doing and at that that you'll you

1088
00:43:38,309 --> 00:43:44,639
that'll just all end in tears the second

1089
00:43:41,550 --> 00:43:47,550
point you make about collaborative you

1090
00:43:44,639 --> 00:43:49,409
know I tell my clients that this is

1091
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:51,030
something that everybody needs to take

1092
00:43:49,409 --> 00:43:54,089
from hip hop right because one of the

1093
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:56,609
most brilliant marketing things to come

1094
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:59,280
out of hip hop is the idea of guesting

1095
00:43:56,608 --> 00:44:03,989
on somebody's album right you can use

1096
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:07,019
guesting to either have a popular artist

1097
00:44:03,989 --> 00:44:08,729
help build the career of somebody who's

1098
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:11,789
just coming up

1099
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:14,099
or you can take two very popular artists

1100
00:44:11,789 --> 00:44:16,050
and have them guest on a song together

1101
00:44:14,099 --> 00:44:18,150
and now they're they're trading

1102
00:44:16,050 --> 00:44:21,330
audiences right so now they're they're

1103
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:23,579
both enriched by that partnership and I

1104
00:44:21,329 --> 00:44:27,210
think that that is a fantastic example

1105
00:44:23,579 --> 00:44:29,219
that fits very well in with cannabis and

1106
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:32,250
I think that you will be seeing more and

1107
00:44:29,219 --> 00:44:38,389
more of these Co branded products come

1108
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:41,130
out as as the industry gets beyond the

1109
00:44:38,389 --> 00:44:43,799
prohibition competitive secretiveness

1110
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:45,420
and becomes more open to working

1111
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:47,280
together and you know where I need to

1112
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:50,639
think that has to happen as soon as

1113
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:53,010
possible is within with artisan cannabis

1114
00:44:50,639 --> 00:44:56,009
growers the heritage growers because

1115
00:44:53,010 --> 00:44:58,620
because if the heritage farmers you know

1116
00:44:56,010 --> 00:45:01,230
since the one acre cap was removed in

1117
00:44:58,619 --> 00:45:04,230
California it's turned into a bloodbath

1118
00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:06,240
and the corporation's have gotten the

1119
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:09,480
money the organization and the

1120
00:45:06,239 --> 00:45:11,839
experience to just come in and roll out

1121
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:14,699
these large marketing programs and

1122
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:18,360
inundate the market with

1123
00:45:14,699 --> 00:45:20,909
brand messaging but but the heritage

1124
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:22,880
farmers while they've got better flour

1125
00:45:20,909 --> 00:45:27,179
they don't necessarily have the

1126
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:30,119
messaging reach and so as artists and

1127
00:45:27,179 --> 00:45:32,969
growers can come together and work

1128
00:45:30,119 --> 00:45:36,839
together and and get their messages out

1129
00:45:32,969 --> 00:45:39,659
as a group on why heritage farming and

1130
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:44,220
why small farms are important and why

1131
00:45:39,659 --> 00:45:46,739
you know growing and living soils is is

1132
00:45:44,219 --> 00:45:48,899
you know preferable for a good tasting

1133
00:45:46,739 --> 00:45:50,969
artisan flower I mean more power to them

1134
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:53,160
you know one one farm in California

1135
00:45:50,969 --> 00:45:56,939
that's doing a great job with that is

1136
00:45:53,159 --> 00:46:00,599
moon time medicinals and so you know

1137
00:45:56,940 --> 00:46:02,429
their website you know they they you

1138
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:04,559
know it's pretty right so so that's

1139
00:46:02,429 --> 00:46:07,349
number one it's nice to be there number

1140
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:11,279
two they know how to talk about the

1141
00:46:07,349 --> 00:46:13,889
importance of artisan you know farming

1142
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:15,210
heritage farmers and and you know they

1143
00:46:13,889 --> 00:46:16,589
are there they're legit there on the

1144
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:18,179
hill and Garberville I mean being in

1145
00:46:16,590 --> 00:46:19,860
Humboldt County that's that's pretty

1146
00:46:18,179 --> 00:46:21,639
legit and they've been doing it for

1147
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:24,338
decades and

1148
00:46:21,639 --> 00:46:27,159
and then and the fact that you know they

1149
00:46:24,338 --> 00:46:30,969
know how to talk about all right so we

1150
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:34,268
use KN f we use inputs from our own

1151
00:46:30,969 --> 00:46:36,669
property we grow in the sunshine and

1152
00:46:34,268 --> 00:46:39,669
this is why you should care about that

1153
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:42,039
so you know not everybody is into that

1154
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:43,690
because a lot of it yet because a lot of

1155
00:46:42,039 --> 00:46:45,309
the Heritage farmers have never really

1156
00:46:43,690 --> 00:46:47,519
need them are needed to market in that

1157
00:46:45,309 --> 00:46:50,528
way but they will get up to speed and

1158
00:46:47,518 --> 00:46:53,018
and if and if they don't it's gonna be a

1159
00:46:50,528 --> 00:46:54,579
lot harder Road yeah you brought up

1160
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:57,338
another good point too which is sort of

1161
00:46:54,579 --> 00:46:59,109
what message are you looking to put out

1162
00:46:57,338 --> 00:47:02,440
there you have to be I think very

1163
00:46:59,108 --> 00:47:04,088
conscious of what what you want your

1164
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:06,190
brand what values you want your brand to

1165
00:47:04,088 --> 00:47:08,068
promote and then make sure that you're

1166
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:12,159
consistent across your social media

1167
00:47:08,068 --> 00:47:13,838
posts to promote that branding so you

1168
00:47:12,159 --> 00:47:17,139
know for example if you're gonna be a

1169
00:47:13,838 --> 00:47:20,288
high end craft cannabis company then

1170
00:47:17,139 --> 00:47:22,868
your photos need to look high-end you

1171
00:47:20,289 --> 00:47:25,960
can't put up you know crummy photos from

1172
00:47:22,869 --> 00:47:27,190
a bad you know bad phone camera you

1173
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:30,490
actually have to take professional

1174
00:47:27,190 --> 00:47:33,548
photographer dose and I think too along

1175
00:47:30,489 --> 00:47:35,318
that line there's so many Instagram

1176
00:47:33,548 --> 00:47:37,500
accounts now which seems to be those

1177
00:47:35,318 --> 00:47:39,880
still the major platform for cannabis

1178
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:44,768
there's so many Instagram accounts that

1179
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:47,079
just have photos of buds or you know wax

1180
00:47:44,768 --> 00:47:49,058
or whatever rosin you know some just

1181
00:47:47,079 --> 00:47:50,410
photos of the actual product there it's

1182
00:47:49,059 --> 00:47:52,059
really boring like if I scroll through

1183
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:54,190
my Instagram feed a lot of them are just

1184
00:47:52,059 --> 00:47:55,809
the same pictures over and over again so

1185
00:47:54,190 --> 00:47:58,150
how do you differentiate yourself from

1186
00:47:55,809 --> 00:48:00,278
all of that how do you you know take

1187
00:47:58,150 --> 00:48:02,920
unique looking photos or take a

1188
00:48:00,278 --> 00:48:04,268
different perspective on social media or

1189
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:07,509
how do you create a message around that

1190
00:48:04,268 --> 00:48:10,179
and be more than just you know bud shots

1191
00:48:07,509 --> 00:48:11,769
but actually a lifestyle brand you know

1192
00:48:10,179 --> 00:48:13,000
how do you create that and I think

1193
00:48:11,768 --> 00:48:14,288
that's really important that people

1194
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,880
think about that when they start

1195
00:48:14,289 --> 00:48:16,930
thinking about their social media it

1196
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:19,050
actually requires a little bit of

1197
00:48:16,929 --> 00:48:28,389
thought

1198
00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:31,640
