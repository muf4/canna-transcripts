00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,209
marketplace and so we're privileged to

2
00:00:03,569 --> 00:00:09,960
have that hustle here today she is going

3
00:00:06,208 --> 00:00:13,018
to talk to you about maybe opening up

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:16,440
your mind a little bit and looking at

5
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:18,240
best practices not just from what has

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,970
been in what I call the vertical tour

7
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:22,719
endemic business that which is always

8
00:00:20,969 --> 00:00:25,589
been part of a cannabis

9
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:28,329
ah dressy but looking out at the larger

10
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:30,939
agricultural horticultural what's out

11
00:00:28,329 --> 00:00:35,170
there in the spectrum of the big picture

12
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:37,630
as we grow into big business so let's

13
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:40,480
bring on pad we have a microphone up

14
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:43,150
front and we would like to see

15
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:45,579
interactive so

16
00:00:43,149 --> 00:00:47,820
we have questions just come on up stand

17
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:50,159
in front and we will recognize you

18
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:56,609
- thank you very much and

19
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:59,709
thank you thanks Dave I appreciate that

20
00:00:56,609 --> 00:01:01,329
this can hear me okay sounds good

21
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:02,768
all right first thing I want to say is

22
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:05,890
there's no need to take notes I'll have

23
00:01:02,768 --> 00:01:08,500
the transcript from how I expected this

24
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:10,689
talk to go at least up on our website on

25
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:13,000
kiss organics comm it'll be the first

26
00:01:10,689 --> 00:01:14,950
blog post so everything all the

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,530
resources and and everything that I

28
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:19,210
mentioned in this talk I will have links

29
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:21,310
to on there so you can just sit back and

30
00:01:19,209 --> 00:01:23,079
relax the whole presentation is not

31
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:24,490
going to use the full hour so while

32
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:28,840
plenty of times for questions at the end

33
00:01:24,489 --> 00:01:31,449
if you have any questions so the first

34
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:33,130
thing I'd like to start with is I'd like

35
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:34,899
to just take a moment and have you think

36
00:01:33,129 --> 00:01:39,189
back and remember the very first time

37
00:01:34,899 --> 00:01:41,739
you saw a cannabis plant now for me that

38
00:01:39,189 --> 00:01:43,599
was in 2005 I remember distinctly

39
00:01:41,739 --> 00:01:45,818
walking down into this gentleman's

40
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:49,059
basement and when he opened the door I

41
00:01:45,819 --> 00:01:50,829
was hit with this overwhelming odor the

42
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:52,509
lights were so bright I was squinting it

43
00:01:50,829 --> 00:01:55,239
was like being transported into a whole

44
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:57,579
nother world and there was a sort of

45
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:59,890
power and mysticism about this plant

46
00:01:57,579 --> 00:02:04,030
something that I had never experienced

47
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:05,560
before you see I up with my parents

48
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:06,159
owning a retail nursery and landscape

49
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,719
company

50
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,699
I've been around plants and today I was

51
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:12,969
born but I had no experience with

52
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:15,159
cannabis and through this journey and

53
00:02:12,969 --> 00:02:17,500
getting to see this plant in person it

54
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:20,889
really it really interested me and it

55
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:22,180
brought me to my first hydro shop and my

56
00:02:20,889 --> 00:02:24,729
first experience in the hydro shop

57
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:26,290
walking in I felt like I was being

58
00:02:24,729 --> 00:02:28,568
transported back to my high school

59
00:02:26,289 --> 00:02:29,620
chemistry class there were no plants

60
00:02:28,568 --> 00:02:31,089
there were all these bottles on the

61
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:32,830
shelves I had never heard ever never

62
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:35,439
seen before and I've been to a lot of

63
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:37,030
nurseries and garden centers and frankly

64
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:38,979
got me really excited to try them all

65
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:40,330
out and find out you know if I could get

66
00:02:38,979 --> 00:02:44,068
this massive growth that they were

67
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:44,069
claiming on a lot of these bottles and

68
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:48,359
I had never seen marketing like this

69
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:49,889
with these you know photos of cartoonish

70
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,200
pictures of beautiful women and these

71
00:02:49,889 --> 00:02:53,819
monster plants totally new to me and not

72
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:58,009
something that you find in your typical

73
00:02:53,819 --> 00:03:00,000
garden center or outside in the AG world

74
00:02:58,009 --> 00:03:01,949
now throughout this journey I was

75
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,620
fortunate to have people like my father

76
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:06,449
here who taught me a lot of what I know

77
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:08,129
about soil this is actually after he had

78
00:03:06,449 --> 00:03:09,689
washed his hands they're literally

79
00:03:08,129 --> 00:03:11,849
stained like that from years and years

80
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:13,949
of just digging in the dirt he founded

81
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:16,139
the nursery and then when he sold the

82
00:03:13,949 --> 00:03:17,429
nursery started a compost tea business

83
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:21,750
and that's sort of when I came in around

84
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:24,450
2005 in addition to that I was fortunate

85
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:27,389
to have a good background in science and

86
00:03:24,449 --> 00:03:30,419
research and I just gotten back from

87
00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:32,729
grad school in Australia and this was

88
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:34,439
our laboratory set up in terms of being

89
00:03:32,729 --> 00:03:36,840
able to have a phase contract microscope

90
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:38,939
and take video and actually look at

91
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,759
these soil microorganisms up close and

92
00:03:38,939 --> 00:03:46,349
and really delve into what was going on

93
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:47,759
in our soils along this process I was

94
00:03:46,349 --> 00:03:49,919
really fortunate to meet some really

95
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:51,539
wonderful people people like Jeff

96
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:53,789
lowenfeld author of teeming with

97
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:55,979
microbes teeming with nutrients in his

98
00:03:53,789 --> 00:03:57,299
latest book teeming with fungi wonderful

99
00:03:55,979 --> 00:03:59,219
author if you ever get a chance to hear

100
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:00,900
him speak he's fascinating a wonderful

101
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:02,460
speaker and these are great books to

102
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:05,490
check out if anything in this talk

103
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:06,960
sounds sounds remotely interesting in

104
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:08,580
addition to that I also became good

105
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,980
friends with Tim Wilson the microbe

106
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:13,350
organics one of the foremost experts on

107
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:16,159
compost teas and some of his works have

108
00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:19,040
even been published in the Smithsonian

109
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,540
dr. Langham of the soil food web my

110
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,760
father was one of the very first soil

111
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:24,260
food web advisors and we were we worked

112
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:26,750
hand in hand with her in establishing

113
00:04:24,259 --> 00:04:28,699
brewing times for compost teas you know

114
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:31,430
whether or not e.coli would reproduce in

115
00:04:28,699 --> 00:04:33,170
in these brews and things like that and

116
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:35,300
in addition to that some other wonderful

117
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:35,750
people like Steve Solomon Erica Ryan

118
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:38,389
himer

119
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:41,000
and gentleman who goes by the online

120
00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:42,740
name of Clackamas coot who people have

121
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,600
started entire businesses and commercial

122
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:49,550
soil mixes around a lot of his concepts

123
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:52,730
and ideas then in 2011 we opened keep it

124
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:55,250
simple farm it's a beautiful property we

125
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:58,220
have a salmon spawning trail that goes

126
00:04:55,250 --> 00:05:00,709
right down right down along this Creek

127
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:03,350
and we give tours to kids on native

128
00:05:00,709 --> 00:05:05,689
habitat and there's an outdoor preschool

129
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:09,590
on the property these are our tobacco

130
00:05:05,689 --> 00:05:11,389
starts last year we do it you pick for

131
00:05:09,589 --> 00:05:13,729
the community and also grow veggies

132
00:05:11,389 --> 00:05:15,289
organic veggie starts the staff has a

133
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:18,290
lot of fun with their plantings we have

134
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:19,180
squash and corn and some watermelon over

135
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:21,500
here

136
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:23,990
it's a it's a beautiful property in a

137
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:25,699
great place to work here's one of the

138
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,810
giant pumpkins that we grew last year we

139
00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:27,800
grow them for the community and they get

140
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:29,449
to guess the weight and then the

141
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,520
preschool kids get to come in with their

142
00:05:29,449 --> 00:05:34,459
hammers and smash away at it at the end

143
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:41,669
of the season it's a lot of fun we have

144
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:44,009
piglets and pigs goats turkeys bees

145
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:46,590
and we just started baby chicks season

146
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:48,420
so I'm very fortunate the fact that I

147
00:05:46,589 --> 00:05:49,979
get to talk to people about chickens and

148
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:51,930
ducks and then the next person in may

149
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:53,189
have a question about soil science what

150
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:54,900
we're talking about apple trees or

151
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:58,709
cannabis it's a lot of fun I'm really

152
00:05:54,899 --> 00:06:00,750
fortunate to do what I do and I believe

153
00:05:58,709 --> 00:06:01,919
by applying some of these principles

154
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:04,949
that I'm going to talk about today in

155
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:06,600
regards to science and research that

156
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:08,819
already exists in the horticulture and

157
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:11,250
agriculture world we can dramatically

158
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:13,319
reduce our costs on conventional bottled

159
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:15,089
nutrient programs by up to 70% or more

160
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:17,689
and that's really what I'd like to talk

161
00:06:15,089 --> 00:06:20,189
to you about today

162
00:06:17,689 --> 00:06:23,430
now the first thing I'd like to suggest

163
00:06:20,189 --> 00:06:25,500
is that you consider going organic now

164
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:27,750
for some of you before your eyes glaze

165
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,399
over my goal today is to give you

166
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:32,129
compelling arguments for why it makes

167
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:35,759
sense from both an economic and an

168
00:06:32,129 --> 00:06:39,110
environmental environmental perspective

169
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:43,759
and address such issues as bugs quality

170
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:46,170
yield and cost so as many people know

171
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:49,579
cannabis has been in the news more

172
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:52,410
recently this was from 2016

173
00:06:49,579 --> 00:06:55,740
unfortunately public perception of

174
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:57,960
cannabis has been damaged quite a bit by

175
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:59,759
the illegal pesticides and plant growth

176
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:01,349
hormones things that are not approved

177
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,629
for use on edible crops that have been

178
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:06,270
found in some of these in some of these

179
00:07:03,629 --> 00:07:07,920
products and this is a big concern I

180
00:07:06,269 --> 00:07:09,810
think in terms of how our industry is

181
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:12,420
perceived it's a big issue in terms of

182
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:15,389
safety of our medicine now from an

183
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:17,129
environmental perspective when we are

184
00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:18,599
fertilizing with a lot of these chemical

185
00:07:17,129 --> 00:07:21,089
fertilizers we have to think about where

186
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:23,160
this products going a lot of that excess

187
00:07:21,089 --> 00:07:25,560
nitrates and phosphates that leached out

188
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:27,540
of the soil mixes are going down into

189
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:29,189
our groundwater which creates algal

190
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:32,879
blooms and dead zones in the ocean which

191
00:07:29,189 --> 00:07:34,800
kills off a lot of marine life most of

192
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:36,659
these products are made using fossil

193
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,550
fuels and are transported all the way

194
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:40,980
from China so there's a huge cost

195
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:43,840
associated with that

196
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:46,960
and one other thing I'd like to mention

197
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:48,459
is a story we're in regards to my

198
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:54,579
experiences with visiting a few of these

199
00:07:48,459 --> 00:07:56,739
502 farms many many of the mineral salts

200
00:07:54,579 --> 00:07:58,810
are mixed up in these giant IBC totes

201
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:00,910
and it's some of the facilities I've

202
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:02,680
visited I've literally seen them being

203
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:05,200
dumped down the drain into septic

204
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:08,350
systems or sewage systems literally

205
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:10,479
polluting the groundwater that exists in

206
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:12,400
that area and I think it's not going to

207
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:14,890
be too much longer before we have a huge

208
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:17,349
issue in regards to either the EPA or

209
00:08:14,889 --> 00:08:19,329
the state coming down and creating

210
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:21,730
regulations or finding companies for

211
00:08:19,329 --> 00:08:23,259
this sort of behavior something to

212
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:27,340
consider in regards to how you're

213
00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:28,329
managing your nutrient program so before

214
00:08:27,339 --> 00:08:31,168
you write me off as a tree-hugging

215
00:08:28,329 --> 00:08:34,809
liberal I'd like to give you some other

216
00:08:31,168 --> 00:08:38,470
good good reasons for going organic now

217
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:43,359
from 2015 Consumer Reports found that 24

218
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:45,129
to 60% of higher price for organic

219
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,169
produce over conventional produce now I

220
00:08:45,129 --> 00:08:48,580
know that doesn't directly translate to

221
00:08:47,169 --> 00:08:50,589
cannabis production because there's not

222
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:52,360
currently an organic standard for

223
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:54,730
cannabis but there are companies working

224
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:57,070
on that companies like certified kine

225
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:59,920
or clean green are attempting to unify

226
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:02,680
the industry under a single broad

227
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:05,049
marketing term similar to our murray or

228
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:07,059
any other certification agency so that

229
00:09:05,049 --> 00:09:08,709
consumers can be educated and know that

230
00:09:07,059 --> 00:09:10,659
when they are purchasing a product it's

231
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:13,360
been tested by an independent agency and

232
00:09:10,659 --> 00:09:16,389
is safe for them so they know that

233
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,980
they'll get saved medicine and frankly

234
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:20,649
we don't even know all the long-term

235
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:22,779
consequences of what combusting or

236
00:09:20,649 --> 00:09:25,659
metabolizing a lot of these chemicals

237
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:27,339
really are or what levels may exist in

238
00:09:25,659 --> 00:09:29,199
the fund the final product especially

239
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:31,000
with a lot of pesticides so I think it's

240
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,530
something it's a I think it's a

241
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,889
responsibility that we have as growers

242
00:09:32,529 --> 00:09:37,209
to provide safe medicine and also for

243
00:09:35,889 --> 00:09:38,799
recreational use when people are growing

244
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:42,580
cannabis

245
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:44,289
and unfortunately not all product

246
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:45,670
manufacturers have been totally honest

247
00:09:44,289 --> 00:09:48,629
with us I mean many of you probably

248
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:50,919
remember Guardian might spray which

249
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:53,470
contained Abba mekt in but they told us

250
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:55,659
it was 100% natural and organic I almost

251
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:57,220
used it on my crop because I was handed

252
00:09:55,659 --> 00:09:59,110
samples and I just fortunately never

253
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:01,329
never got around to and it was highly

254
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:03,250
effective because it had the same active

255
00:10:01,328 --> 00:10:07,989
components as Abbott something not

256
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:10,299
approved for use on cannabis other

257
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:12,669
products such as bushmaster and gravity

258
00:10:10,299 --> 00:10:14,649
and flower dragon they contained Hakala

259
00:10:12,669 --> 00:10:16,599
beatriz all plant growth hormones that

260
00:10:14,649 --> 00:10:18,850
made the made the buds much heavier and

261
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,950
denser so they had more more weight and

262
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:26,409
more package appeal again not approved

263
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:28,540
for use on cannabis production now one

264
00:10:26,409 --> 00:10:30,219
of the biggest reasons I think going

265
00:10:28,539 --> 00:10:32,379
organic makes sense is it gives you the

266
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:34,570
ability to reuse and recycle your soil

267
00:10:32,379 --> 00:10:36,610
this is huge because you no longer have

268
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:37,870
the cost of moving soil in and out of

269
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:39,730
your facility if you have an indoor

270
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:42,610
facility you don't have the cost of

271
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:45,250
buying new soil every cycle or every

272
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:49,000
other cycle or the cost of disposing of

273
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:52,089
this so huge advantages to recycling and

274
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,278
reusing soil now the first question I

275
00:10:52,089 --> 00:10:56,410
hear when typically brought up or the

276
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:57,820
first concern is bugs how do you deal

277
00:10:56,409 --> 00:11:00,939
with bugs if you're reusing and

278
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:02,829
recycling soil well we've had growers

279
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:03,940
organic growers in soil for more than

280
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:08,169
two years they've had to deal with

281
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:13,510
everything from broad mites the russet

282
00:11:08,169 --> 00:11:16,389
mite sarude aphid powdery mildew the tea

283
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:17,049
spotted spider mites fungus gnats and

284
00:11:16,389 --> 00:11:20,078
much more

285
00:11:17,049 --> 00:11:22,179
so I firmly believe with an effective

286
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:24,159
IPM program and preventative maintenance

287
00:11:22,179 --> 00:11:25,328
you can totally keep these bugs under

288
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:28,269
control and manage

289
00:11:25,328 --> 00:11:29,738
and when I say organics I don't mean

290
00:11:28,269 --> 00:11:31,778
that we're just choosing to live in

291
00:11:29,739 --> 00:11:33,970
harmony with a lot of these insects but

292
00:11:31,778 --> 00:11:35,948
we're actually actively and preventative

293
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:37,629
ly maintaining our garden it can still

294
00:11:35,948 --> 00:11:39,669
be clean we can still access and use

295
00:11:37,629 --> 00:11:41,558
scientific method and a lot of these

296
00:11:39,669 --> 00:11:43,509
properties so don't think the organics

297
00:11:41,558 --> 00:11:44,860
means we just chuck science or chuck

298
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:45,970
cleanliness out the window that's not

299
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:49,480
the case at all or not what I'm

300
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:52,239
advocating so what is reuse so really

301
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:54,819
look like this is a photo that we had

302
00:11:52,239 --> 00:11:57,040
one of our growers took this soil is

303
00:11:54,818 --> 00:11:58,659
over two years old this grower was

304
00:11:57,039 --> 00:12:00,368
averaging one point six the one point

305
00:11:58,659 --> 00:12:02,850
pounds per one point eight pounds per

306
00:12:00,369 --> 00:12:05,160
light or about 35 grams per square foot

307
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:08,649
single-ended fixtures no co2

308
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:10,448
supplementation and that entire bed down

309
00:12:08,649 --> 00:12:12,489
the road cost me about fifty dollars in

310
00:12:10,448 --> 00:12:13,798
nutrients and media and that media has

311
00:12:12,489 --> 00:12:17,019
been sitting there for over two years

312
00:12:13,798 --> 00:12:19,360
the process is really quite simple you

313
00:12:17,019 --> 00:12:21,669
literally pull the plant out of the bed

314
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,769
shake off whatever soil is around the

315
00:12:21,669 --> 00:12:25,738
roots and then harvest your plant and

316
00:12:23,769 --> 00:12:27,489
then you'll bring in every time you

317
00:12:25,739 --> 00:12:28,720
harvest a plant you're pulling out

318
00:12:27,489 --> 00:12:30,040
organic matter and you're pulling out

319
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,309
nutrients and those need to be replaced

320
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:35,110
so you can you can literally add some

321
00:12:33,308 --> 00:12:36,759
more some high quality compost about a

322
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:38,889
cubic foot per yard we found is a good

323
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:40,589
recommendation and then add some of

324
00:12:38,889 --> 00:12:43,899
those dry nutrients back into the soil

325
00:12:40,589 --> 00:12:46,629
mix it back in and 24 to 36 hours you're

326
00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:48,639
bringing in your next crop here's some

327
00:12:46,629 --> 00:12:50,199
photos for some other growers again all

328
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,489
of the soil in the photos I'm showing

329
00:12:50,198 --> 00:12:53,789
her all these buds were grown and sold

330
00:12:51,489 --> 00:12:56,160
it's over two years old

331
00:12:53,789 --> 00:13:00,750
this is from fire farms down in Oregon

332
00:12:56,159 --> 00:13:02,879
and even if you decide that organics is

333
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:04,529
not the way to go I don't think at least

334
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:07,110
be open-minded to considering looking

335
00:13:04,529 --> 00:13:09,149
outside of your local hydro shop for

336
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:10,139
some of these nutrients this is an

337
00:13:09,149 --> 00:13:12,899
article that was published in December

338
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:15,600
of last year company called out Co hired

339
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:17,100
this woman Alison justice she's coming

340
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,320
from the horticultural industry industry

341
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:22,139
they brought her in and she was able to

342
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:26,010
switch them from a conventional bottled

343
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:27,779
nutrient program to ingredients that she

344
00:13:26,009 --> 00:13:29,519
found and was aware of just from the

345
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:32,759
horn industry that had similar NPK

346
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:34,529
values dropped their cost 22 times over

347
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:36,480
what they were paying before as many of

348
00:13:34,529 --> 00:13:38,730
you know your expenses are just as

349
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,970
important as your sales now from an

350
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:45,090
organic perspective it's even cheaper we

351
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:47,940
found that by recycling and reusing the

352
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:49,470
soil we've gotten on an average yield of

353
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,820
about four pounds per yard or two pounds

354
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:52,560
perlite which is what most of our

355
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:54,780
growers with co2 and double-ended

356
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:56,369
fixtures are averaging we're seeing

357
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:58,139
about five cents a gram now that

358
00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:00,720
includes your substrate and your

359
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:02,759
nutrient so that's that's bull and then

360
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,399
the following Jager down to under two

361
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:07,169
cents a gram very very affordable no I'm

362
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:09,000
not aware of any other program that can

363
00:14:07,169 --> 00:14:11,449
be can get that low in terms of your

364
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,450
costs

365
00:14:11,889 --> 00:14:16,340
goldleaf Gardens is a great example of

366
00:14:14,419 --> 00:14:18,049
this type of growing strategy they have

367
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:20,000
a great reputation they're known for

368
00:14:18,049 --> 00:14:22,879
quality and something that really struck

369
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,519
me was a group people came up to our

370
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:27,350
booth earlier this week and I was

371
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,429
talking them and they recognized the

372
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:30,440
gold leaf guard this video we had

373
00:14:28,429 --> 00:14:31,429
playing and I was asking them what do

374
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,230
you think you know what do you think of

375
00:14:31,429 --> 00:14:35,659
their product I haven't been to a lot of

376
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:37,190
rec shops myself and the first word she

377
00:14:35,659 --> 00:14:40,669
used to describe them was it's very

378
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:41,690
consistent and I think that's really

379
00:14:40,669 --> 00:14:43,909
really important when we talk about

380
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:46,070
top-shelf cannabis and top-shelf

381
00:14:43,909 --> 00:14:47,870
cannabis brands is that ability to

382
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:50,900
produce a consistent product over and

383
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:54,919
over again that is that is of high

384
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:56,629
quality and organic they also make the

385
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:59,240
material four layer layer Arkana gars

386
00:14:56,629 --> 00:15:01,789
another connoisseur branding all of that

387
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,970
is coming out of organic soil and grown

388
00:15:01,789 --> 00:15:06,649
by gold leaf all the material for that

389
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:09,680
here's their facility in their facility

390
00:15:06,649 --> 00:15:12,019
they're using modified fabric raised

391
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:15,229
beds about 1/3 of a yard per bed and

392
00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:16,939
they're averaging two to three two to

393
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:18,980
three pounds across all their strains or

394
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:20,630
about sixty grams per square foot in

395
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:23,180
terms of their yield they are using

396
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:28,480
double-ended kavita's and they are such

397
00:15:23,179 --> 00:15:28,479
they are they are supplementing with co2

398
00:15:29,649 --> 00:15:34,698
so really what our goal here is from an

399
00:15:32,448 --> 00:15:38,689
organic perspective is to create a

400
00:15:34,698 --> 00:15:40,490
living ecology and recreate nature to

401
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:42,620
the best of our ability in these

402
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:44,269
facilities and in these beds and that

403
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:45,379
does require a certain amount of soil

404
00:15:44,269 --> 00:15:47,629
that's why they're going with raised

405
00:15:45,379 --> 00:15:49,338
beds it's a nice buffer and it allows

406
00:15:47,629 --> 00:15:51,980
you to get more nutrients into the soil

407
00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:53,779
rather than having to add nutrients

408
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:55,430
constantly throughout the cycle and they

409
00:15:53,778 --> 00:15:57,769
do supplement with things like molasses

410
00:15:55,429 --> 00:16:00,019
and compost teas and other ways to

411
00:15:57,769 --> 00:16:03,169
encourage microbial growth and I'll talk

412
00:16:00,019 --> 00:16:05,179
a little bit about that here next so if

413
00:16:03,169 --> 00:16:08,000
we can assume that there is benefit to

414
00:16:05,179 --> 00:16:09,349
considering growing organically the next

415
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,778
thing that becomes really important is

416
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:14,839
getting good biology and microbial

417
00:16:11,778 --> 00:16:17,389
diversity in our soil this is a photo of

418
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:19,430
cyanobacteria actually creating soil

419
00:16:17,389 --> 00:16:21,589
structure it's these microorganisms the

420
00:16:19,429 --> 00:16:22,818
bacteria and fungi that bond the soil

421
00:16:21,589 --> 00:16:24,380
together and create that structure

422
00:16:22,818 --> 00:16:28,429
really really important from a plant

423
00:16:24,379 --> 00:16:30,110
perspective now an important distinction

424
00:16:28,429 --> 00:16:31,849
when we're applying mineral salts is

425
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:33,649
we're directly feeding the plant ionic

426
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:35,420
nutrients but when we put out organic

427
00:16:33,649 --> 00:16:36,889
fertilizer we're not directly feeding

428
00:16:35,419 --> 00:16:38,448
the plant we're feeding all of these

429
00:16:36,889 --> 00:16:43,879
microbial communities that's the

430
00:16:38,448 --> 00:16:45,979
bacteria archaea fungal hyphae protozoa

431
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:47,179
flageolets ciliates amoeba all those

432
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:49,190
micro organisms that you may have

433
00:16:47,179 --> 00:16:54,439
studied back in junior high biology

434
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:56,630
class and in addition to that the the

435
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,670
plant is photosynthesis photosynthesis

436
00:16:56,629 --> 00:17:00,769
in sunlight and it's putting up to 40%

437
00:16:58,669 --> 00:17:02,059
of that energy back out through the soil

438
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:04,640
in the form of exudates

439
00:17:02,059 --> 00:17:07,039
and that's things like sugars carbon

440
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,049
carbohydrates to feed these microbial

441
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:10,338
communities and those microbial

442
00:17:09,048 --> 00:17:11,900
communities are then cycling the

443
00:17:10,338 --> 00:17:13,789
nutrients and making the plant available

444
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:15,699
so if the plant the plant actually

445
00:17:13,789 --> 00:17:17,928
controls us too so if it wants more

446
00:17:15,699 --> 00:17:19,850
phosphorus or more potassium and it can

447
00:17:17,929 --> 00:17:21,709
actually control that process by putting

448
00:17:19,849 --> 00:17:23,658
out exudates it's select for the

449
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:25,009
microorganisms that make these nutrients

450
00:17:23,659 --> 00:17:27,530
plants available

451
00:17:25,009 --> 00:17:30,849
and in the natural system this is the

452
00:17:27,529 --> 00:17:30,849
way that the plant receives nutrients

453
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:36,559
just to give you another perspective on

454
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:39,500
this another visual this is a small

455
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:41,269
amount of our potting soil with a little

456
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:43,400
bit of distilled water and molasses just

457
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:45,769
to show you what these microorganisms

458
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:49,190
really look like what you're seeing here

459
00:17:45,769 --> 00:17:51,230
this is all fungal hyphae these are all

460
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:53,450
bacteria are running around and these

461
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:56,029
bacteria then are eating up the organic

462
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:59,180
matter and in turn being eaten by other

463
00:17:56,029 --> 00:18:01,970
bacteria and by larger microorganisms

464
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:04,279
like flageolets ciliates amoeba and

465
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:06,470
nematodes and then what they excrete is

466
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:08,149
now a plant available nutrient so when

467
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:10,460
we put out excess amounts of mineral

468
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:13,130
salts or chemicals what we're doing is

469
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:14,720
we're destroying some of these some of

470
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:17,360
these micro microbial communities and

471
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,100
the problem with that is that this is

472
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:21,529
also what helps defend the plant and

473
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:24,019
keep it safe from a lot of the diseases

474
00:18:21,529 --> 00:18:27,799
that we face especially in facilities

475
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:30,049
and indoor communities now there's not a

476
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:32,389
lot of microbial products that I really

477
00:18:30,049 --> 00:18:35,269
think are essential to growing cannabis

478
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:37,280
but mycorrhizal fungi is definitely one

479
00:18:35,269 --> 00:18:39,799
of them most people by now are familiar

480
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:42,019
with micro Raizel fungus it is a a

481
00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:44,359
microorganism that's been around for

482
00:18:42,019 --> 00:18:45,650
more than 450 million years million

483
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:47,689
years but weren't even aware of it until

484
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:49,850
I don't know maybe 30 or 40 years ago

485
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:52,490
and it forms a symbiotic relationship

486
00:18:49,849 --> 00:18:54,529
with the roots of our plants it's one of

487
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:57,319
the primary ways the natural system the

488
00:18:54,529 --> 00:18:59,329
plant receives phosphorus and by

489
00:18:57,319 --> 00:19:01,879
infecting the plants it actually

490
00:18:59,329 --> 00:19:06,480
provides it with protection from a lot

491
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:08,580
of diseases it outcompetes a certain

492
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,890
certain my other pathogenic

493
00:19:08,579 --> 00:19:14,548
microorganisms like Phytophthora and

494
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:17,490
rhizoctonia and Fusarium for limited

495
00:19:14,548 --> 00:19:19,529
nutrients in the soil and when we talk

496
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:21,058
about when we talk about mycorrhizal

497
00:19:19,529 --> 00:19:23,099
fungus it's really really important to

498
00:19:21,058 --> 00:19:26,819
realize that the ones that associate

499
00:19:23,099 --> 00:19:29,089
with cannabis are known as Glomus

500
00:19:26,819 --> 00:19:31,649
species or endo micro raisa and

501
00:19:29,089 --> 00:19:34,289
specifically Glomus enter a disease and

502
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:36,690
Glomus masya are the two that associated

503
00:19:34,289 --> 00:19:37,769
with cannabis that are known to the

504
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:38,669
reason I put this slide up here is

505
00:19:37,769 --> 00:19:40,558
because they've recently been

506
00:19:38,669 --> 00:19:42,600
reclassified they can now be called rise

507
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:45,000
of agus enter a disease or rise of agus

508
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:47,039
to regularise Glomus masya is now being

509
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,058
called funnel formas ma CA just really

510
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,859
important so when you're looking in the

511
00:19:48,058 --> 00:19:51,990
package this is what you want to look

512
00:19:49,859 --> 00:19:55,619
for is one of these one of these five

513
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:57,298
terms now in addition to be one of the

514
00:19:55,619 --> 00:19:58,979
being one of the primary ways a plant

515
00:19:57,298 --> 00:20:01,379
receives phosphorus the natural system

516
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:03,839
they've also found that mycorrhizal

517
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:06,510
fungus can increase absorption up to 40

518
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:07,649
times more for nitrogen sulphur boron

519
00:20:06,509 --> 00:20:10,289
copper and zinc

520
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:12,690
it also contains cytokinin jasmine oak

521
00:20:10,289 --> 00:20:15,298
acids and salicylic acids and auxins and

522
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:17,250
cytokinins are really important for root

523
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:19,440
development jazz monic and salicylic

524
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:21,480
acid helps with the plants natural

525
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,009
defense system and auxins are really

526
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:26,069
important in many different aspects of

527
00:20:23,009 --> 00:20:28,200
cellular development so it serves a

528
00:20:26,069 --> 00:20:29,909
myriad of functions beyond just

529
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:32,669
providing phosphorus or nutrients for

530
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:34,380
the planet so how do we use micro

531
00:20:32,669 --> 00:20:37,740
eyes'll fungus appropriately in our

532
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:39,809
gardening practices well it's really a

533
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:41,429
one-time application to the roots

534
00:20:39,808 --> 00:20:42,250
directly when transplanting rooted

535
00:20:41,429 --> 00:20:43,840
clones

536
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:45,159
you want to make sure that it comes in

537
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:47,619
direct contact with the roots because

538
00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:49,539
it's a root Symbian so personally I

539
00:20:47,619 --> 00:20:51,519
choose not to add it to compost teas or

540
00:20:49,538 --> 00:20:53,589
with other microorganisms because it may

541
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:55,658
just become a very expensive food source

542
00:20:53,589 --> 00:20:57,009
for those and I don't like to add it in

543
00:20:55,659 --> 00:20:58,390
on top of the soil too because it

544
00:20:57,009 --> 00:21:01,419
actually needs to come in contact with

545
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:02,950
the roots for cannabis cultivation it's

546
00:21:01,419 --> 00:21:05,230
really simple and easy to add it in

547
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:07,480
right when we transplant if you had a

548
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:13,569
tree or an existing bush you can dig

549
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:15,400
down and do a root injection now what

550
00:21:13,569 --> 00:21:17,589
I've talked about so far is really a

551
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:19,059
nutrient cycling or it's also known as

552
00:21:17,589 --> 00:21:21,069
the microbial loop in scientific

553
00:21:19,058 --> 00:21:23,288
literature is sort of the biological

554
00:21:21,069 --> 00:21:25,298
aspects associated with cannabis with

555
00:21:23,288 --> 00:21:27,579
cannabis and plant growth what I'd like

556
00:21:25,298 --> 00:21:28,750
to talk about now is a little a little

557
00:21:27,579 --> 00:21:30,339
bit more about the minerals and

558
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,990
nutrients associated with the soil and

559
00:21:30,339 --> 00:21:34,449
to do that I want to tell you about this

560
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:37,269
gentleman here his name is Steve Solomon

561
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:39,490
he was the founder of territorial seeds

562
00:21:37,269 --> 00:21:41,679
and he's written a couple pretty famous

563
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:43,900
books for our region including gardening

564
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,600
west of the Cascades and more recently a

565
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:47,409
book called the intelligent gardener

566
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:50,230
Steve's life is actually really

567
00:21:47,409 --> 00:21:51,970
fascinating in 1978 he moved to Oregon

568
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:54,759
and began homesteading off his land and

569
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:57,519
in the 1979 he opened territorial seeds

570
00:21:54,759 --> 00:21:58,950
and he was doing everything you were

571
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:02,288
taught at the time when it came to

572
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:04,150
organic production he was using animal

573
00:22:02,288 --> 00:22:06,158
manures at compost he was adding

574
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:07,929
dolomite to sweeten the soil everything

575
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:10,809
that we're taught is important from an

576
00:22:07,929 --> 00:22:12,429
organic grower perspective but he found

577
00:22:10,808 --> 00:22:14,319
that his energy level over the next few

578
00:22:12,429 --> 00:22:16,480
years was deteriorating rapidly his

579
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:18,158
teeth were starting to fall out his gums

580
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,650
were getting soft as his dentist called

581
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:23,340
him wobblers his wife's fingernails were

582
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:25,659
actually becoming soft and pliable and

583
00:22:23,339 --> 00:22:27,639
he couldn't figure out what was going on

584
00:22:25,659 --> 00:22:29,169
over half his diet was stuff that he was

585
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:31,570
growing himself right there on his land

586
00:22:29,169 --> 00:22:33,570
primarily vegetable vegetable based and

587
00:22:31,569 --> 00:22:38,009
doing everything he could to be a

588
00:22:33,569 --> 00:22:43,349
organic farmer well over this time

589
00:22:38,009 --> 00:22:45,180
period he he decided in let's see 1984

590
00:22:43,349 --> 00:22:46,619
to take a vacation with his wife the

591
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:48,120
business was finally up and running and

592
00:22:46,619 --> 00:22:49,949
they were able to take a bit of a

593
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:52,019
sabbatical with his family so they left

594
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:53,819
and went to Fiji where they lived for

595
00:22:52,019 --> 00:22:55,410
six months and over the period of the

596
00:22:53,819 --> 00:22:57,539
next few months he found that his health

597
00:22:55,410 --> 00:23:00,150
was improving dramatically his energy

598
00:22:57,539 --> 00:23:01,710
was recovering his teeth his gums were

599
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:04,050
firming up and his wife's fingernails

600
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:06,950
were getting harder he wasn't sure if it

601
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:09,539
was the lifestyle the wonderful weather

602
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:11,130
he decided to look further into where

603
00:23:09,539 --> 00:23:13,799
the vegetables were actually being grown

604
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:15,630
and he found that there was this valley

605
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:18,149
where they were spraying all manner of

606
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:20,220
chemical pesticides but they weren't

607
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:22,680
using any fertilizer and it was on this

608
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:26,009
diet that his health was he was rapidly

609
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:27,950
improving so he found out that this

610
00:23:26,009 --> 00:23:30,629
particular valley would flood

611
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:32,519
periodically by cyclones that would come

612
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:35,760
in the region and they would they would

613
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:38,400
deposit at that time a bunch of silt and

614
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:40,769
clay from a local igneous rock deposit

615
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:43,230
where about extinct volcano used to

616
00:23:40,769 --> 00:23:44,759
exist and then the weeds would grow up

617
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:46,710
to chest height that would then be

618
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:49,259
tilled in and then they would plant the

619
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:50,789
vegetables again no fertilizer the

620
00:23:49,259 --> 00:23:53,759
organic matter was coming from the weeds

621
00:23:50,789 --> 00:23:55,980
and they were spraying all types of

622
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:57,990
terrible pesticides on this crop and yet

623
00:23:55,980 --> 00:24:00,210
his health was improving so you then

624
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:02,339
went back to Oregon and found his health

625
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:04,440
declining again and started reading the

626
00:24:02,339 --> 00:24:06,449
works of William Albrecht that were

627
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,130
actually published back in the 1920s and

628
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:09,299
1930s this information has been around

629
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:11,550
for a really long time

630
00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:15,059
all around the idea of mineral balancing

631
00:24:11,549 --> 00:24:17,750
and nutrient density and in addition to

632
00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:21,059
William Albrecht people like Kari reams

633
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:22,470
Michaelis Tara Neel Kinsey and many more

634
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:25,109
I've done a lot of research on this on

635
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:29,559
optimal levels of minerals and nutrients

636
00:24:25,109 --> 00:24:32,079
in the soil so I would like to equate

637
00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:34,690
some of these chemical nutrients with

638
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:36,939
the idea of eating a Big Mac every

639
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:38,650
single day for every meal now yes it

640
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:40,960
contains protein fats and carbohydrates

641
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:43,390
you will grow but you'll probably be

642
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,610
more more more exposed to disease and

643
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:49,780
pathogens your health will probably

644
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:51,969
suffer in the long term and one thing

645
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:54,759
that they found with this is by doing a

646
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:58,000
soil test and this soil test cost

647
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:59,529
twenty-five dollars we like to use Logan

648
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,240
labs just because it gives us

649
00:24:59,529 --> 00:25:03,670
consistency across comparing all of

650
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:09,130
these tests this will give us a lot of

651
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:10,900
information including pH CEC calcium

652
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:14,590
levels and all these other trace

653
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:17,769
minerals again only $25 and don't take

654
00:25:14,589 --> 00:25:19,750
this as the end-all this just gives us

655
00:25:17,769 --> 00:25:22,450
an a rough guideline of where our soil

656
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:24,670
is at but by knowing having an idea of

657
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:26,590
what sorts of excesses and deficiencies

658
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:29,259
exists in our soils we're then able to

659
00:25:26,589 --> 00:25:30,730
reinvent them and improve them so even

660
00:25:29,259 --> 00:25:32,619
if you're used to buying say a

661
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:34,120
commercial potting soil getting a twenty

662
00:25:32,619 --> 00:25:35,919
five dollar soil test on that potting

663
00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:37,059
soil finding out if there's anything you

664
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,769
can do to improve upon it before

665
00:25:37,059 --> 00:25:40,899
planting your plants could have a

666
00:25:38,769 --> 00:25:44,230
dramatic effect on your overall crop

667
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:47,019
health one example I like to give is

668
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:48,130
organic alfalfa meal this is something

669
00:25:47,019 --> 00:25:48,609
that you can find at your local feed

670
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:51,940
store

671
00:25:48,609 --> 00:25:53,829
it runs around 20 22 to 25 dollars for a

672
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:57,700
40 to 50 pound bag of it so it's really

673
00:25:53,829 --> 00:26:00,189
affordable it contains a small amount of

674
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:01,600
fast release nitrogen it's an excellent

675
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:03,850
microbial food so it's going to increase

676
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:05,319
all that bacteria and fungi when you

677
00:26:03,849 --> 00:26:07,359
apply it all the stuff like we showed in

678
00:26:05,319 --> 00:26:09,039
that that other photo and it also

679
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:11,139
contains try a constant all which is a

680
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:14,529
really important plant growth hormone

681
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:16,750
associated with bud production so for

682
00:26:14,529 --> 00:26:18,700
cannabis it's it's has a lot of value

683
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:20,440
and Rose growers swear by alfalfa meal

684
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:22,390
you may hear them talking about how they

685
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:24,610
added into their gardens

686
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:26,920
kelp meal is another one that I really

687
00:26:24,609 --> 00:26:29,529
like you're picking up a small amount of

688
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:31,950
nitrogen and potassium but it also

689
00:26:29,529 --> 00:26:34,450
contains over 70 different elements

690
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:37,539
we've science has discovered that plants

691
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:40,269
need a minimum of 14 to 16 elements to

692
00:26:37,539 --> 00:26:43,180
grow but recently we've discovered that

693
00:26:40,269 --> 00:26:44,829
beyond that research has found that

694
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:47,320
there's many more elements in the soil

695
00:26:44,829 --> 00:26:49,329
the plants are able to use we're talking

696
00:26:47,319 --> 00:26:51,759
parts per million two part parts per

697
00:26:49,329 --> 00:26:55,299
billion so by having something that adds

698
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:57,099
like a rock dust or tell meal that has a

699
00:26:55,299 --> 00:26:59,230
lot of these enema these trace minerals

700
00:26:57,099 --> 00:27:02,169
in them it allows the plant to access

701
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:03,819
these over time and kelp also contains a

702
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:05,350
lot of really good plant growth hormones

703
00:27:03,819 --> 00:27:07,659
and regulators things like cytokinins

704
00:27:05,349 --> 00:27:11,289
gibberellins oxidants some of the things

705
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:12,940
we mentioned before so here's some just

706
00:27:11,289 --> 00:27:14,139
a variety of nitrogen sources that I

707
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:16,210
made up the other day just to give you

708
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:17,730
an idea there's so many more but these

709
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:21,190
are all things that you can source

710
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:23,140
probably locally fishmeal for example is

711
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:25,450
around 10% nitrogen it's a fast release

712
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:28,480
source alfalfa is 1 to 2 percent

713
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:30,160
nitrogen neem seed and feather meal are

714
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,660
slow release nitrogen source so you'll

715
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:34,650
get that in nitrogen over a period of

716
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:37,930
months rather than a period of weeks

717
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:40,570
animal manures cottonseed and compost

718
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:43,990
and vermicompost contains nitrogen as

719
00:27:40,569 --> 00:27:46,689
well phosphorus yeah fish fill and meal

720
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:49,420
bone meal soft rock phosphate contains

721
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:51,490
calcium and phosphorus guano's manures

722
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:53,560
and fish hydrolysate that's been

723
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:54,819
stabilized with phosphoric acid all

724
00:27:53,559 --> 00:27:56,980
great ways to pick up phosphorus

725
00:27:54,819 --> 00:27:59,500
potassium

726
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:01,450
I found the cannabis really really likes

727
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:03,579
really really like the potassium so I

728
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:04,990
always like to give plants a larger

729
00:28:03,579 --> 00:28:07,269
amount that's why you seal I think a lot

730
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:09,970
of PK boosters in the industry as well

731
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:11,529
but things like kelp meal seaweed

732
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:14,380
extract powder is quite high in

733
00:28:11,529 --> 00:28:16,420
potassium and then not organic but

734
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:17,860
potassium sulfate and potassium silicate

735
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:19,800
or other ways to pick it up

736
00:28:17,859 --> 00:28:26,189
compost green sand came

737
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:27,629
and again alfalfa me over so a changing

738
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:30,240
direction a little bit the next thing

739
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:32,040
I'd like to suggest is as growers we

740
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,920
start taking a hard look at ingredient

741
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:36,990
lists and seeing what's on the label and

742
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:38,519
anytime I hear from a particular

743
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:40,680
manufacturing company that something is

744
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:42,119
proprietary to me that means it's not

745
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,620
something that I necessarily choose to

746
00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:45,059
use on my garden I want to know

747
00:28:43,619 --> 00:28:47,429
everything that's going both in my soil

748
00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:49,679
and in my crop not just for health

749
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:51,330
reasons but because there may be some

750
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,230
potential liabilities down the road as

751
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:55,049
we discussed with some other

752
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:57,539
manufacturers and we want to know that

753
00:28:55,049 --> 00:28:57,930
we're growing safe crops so keep that in

754
00:28:57,539 --> 00:29:01,349
mind

755
00:28:57,930 --> 00:29:03,090
I hear proprietary either to me that

756
00:29:01,349 --> 00:29:04,589
means also potentially that they're

757
00:29:03,089 --> 00:29:06,509
really doing something like using a lot

758
00:29:04,589 --> 00:29:07,709
of these ingredients here that we could

759
00:29:06,509 --> 00:29:11,759
source somewhere else much more

760
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:13,230
affordably so let's start comparing

761
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:14,670
apples to apples which is really really

762
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:17,730
tough to do when it comes to a lot of

763
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:20,039
these products so many companies have

764
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:20,400
mycorrhizal fungi now how do we compare

765
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:22,440
them

766
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:25,200
well we already discussed how Glomus

767
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:28,019
enter a disease and Glomus Massey a are

768
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,730
the two that is that infect cannabis so

769
00:29:28,019 --> 00:29:31,829
that's a good starting point right there

770
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:34,259
pumpkin Pro is a new one out but from

771
00:29:31,829 --> 00:29:37,019
the giant pumpkin industry from a former

772
00:29:34,259 --> 00:29:39,390
world record holder it's 300 spores per

773
00:29:37,019 --> 00:29:42,389
gram it doesn't contain Trichoderma and

774
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:44,310
five pounds around $60 now trichoderma

775
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:46,160
has been found Trichoderma and high

776
00:29:44,309 --> 00:29:49,259
phosphorus have been found to inhibit

777
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:51,390
mycorrhizal infection rates with a bunch

778
00:29:49,259 --> 00:29:53,420
of studies out now primarily out of

779
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:56,540
Florida

780
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:57,800
by not by not having try can track your

781
00:29:56,539 --> 00:29:59,889
derma in there we're giving the plan the

782
00:29:57,799 --> 00:30:03,409
best success to make that infection

783
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:05,960
mycosis another one 80s force to 300

784
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:08,960
scores per gram no Trichoderma pound

785
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:12,350
runs about $20 now we look at great

786
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:14,269
white here 219,000 propagules of micro

787
00:30:12,349 --> 00:30:17,359
Eisen that looks that looks really good

788
00:30:14,269 --> 00:30:18,829
on the package only 83 proper girls

789
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:20,899
program though of the Glomus species

790
00:30:18,829 --> 00:30:22,789
that associate with cannabis a lot of

791
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:25,400
those propagules up here our octo

792
00:30:22,789 --> 00:30:27,680
mycorrhizal so they typically associate

793
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:29,420
with conifers now I was talking with

794
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:31,130
some people yesterday about this and

795
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:34,730
there may be some benefit to having ecto

796
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:36,560
mycorrhizal fungus in your soil but when

797
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:38,329
we talk about mycorrhizal infection or

798
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:39,289
colonization we really need to look at

799
00:30:38,329 --> 00:30:41,629
the ones that are going to infect

800
00:30:39,289 --> 00:30:43,869
cannabis itself and eight ounces to get

801
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:46,310
there running around 72 dollars

802
00:30:43,869 --> 00:30:50,539
michael maximum here you're looking at

803
00:30:46,309 --> 00:30:51,919
27 spores per gram pound is $52 and then

804
00:30:50,539 --> 00:30:53,960
this product from hydro organics i

805
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:56,900
grabbed was 2.46 property goals program

806
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:59,900
I seen in the garden industry I'll see

807
00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:01,759
companies will put with my coryza

808
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:04,040
on the label on their fertilizer label

809
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:05,089
and then I go back and flip it over and

810
00:31:04,039 --> 00:31:07,759
look on the other side then it'll be

811
00:31:05,089 --> 00:31:09,470
point zero eight scores for C senior

812
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:11,539
sports program not enough to actually

813
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:13,339
get micro eyes'll infection but enough

814
00:31:11,539 --> 00:31:15,349
for them to put it on the label to where

815
00:31:13,339 --> 00:31:17,179
the you know the ignorant gardener will

816
00:31:15,349 --> 00:31:18,379
think that they're getting this this in

817
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:22,789
addition to everything else on the

818
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:25,550
fertilizer now unfortunately looking at

819
00:31:22,789 --> 00:31:27,589
a label isn't enough and this is they

820
00:31:25,549 --> 00:31:29,990
found that the Oregon Department of

821
00:31:27,589 --> 00:31:33,500
Agriculture did a microbial testing on a

822
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:34,789
lot of these products in 2015 now before

823
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:39,440
I show this I just want to say that I'm

824
00:31:34,789 --> 00:31:40,700
not here to promote or condone any of

825
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,380
these products or say anything negative

826
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:44,450
about them this is just the research

827
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:46,370
that the Oregon Department of Ag came up

828
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:48,620
with they found with the advance

829
00:31:46,369 --> 00:31:50,899
nutrients product Parana they were

830
00:31:48,619 --> 00:31:51,469
claiming 234 propagules per gram of

831
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:53,298
micro

832
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:55,850
there was none detected on the label

833
00:31:53,298 --> 00:31:57,980
same with Trichoderma and Pseudomonas OG

834
00:31:55,849 --> 00:32:00,469
bio are here they claimed 500 spores per

835
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:04,069
gram only one score program was found in

836
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:08,329
the sample that they tested OGT organic

837
00:32:04,069 --> 00:32:12,048
bounty great white claimed 365 they only

838
00:32:08,329 --> 00:32:14,839
found 53 RTI claimed 80 they found 42

839
00:32:12,048 --> 00:32:17,298
Santiam organics and southern oregon

840
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:19,908
Bokashi a million CF use per gram of

841
00:32:17,298 --> 00:32:23,058
bacillus they only found 43 CFPs per

842
00:32:19,909 --> 00:32:24,380
gram so I don't know if it's the

843
00:32:23,058 --> 00:32:25,908
shelf-life of these products and they

844
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:27,710
were sitting on the shelf too long or if

845
00:32:25,909 --> 00:32:29,600
they weren't you know hitting their

846
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:32,120
guaranteed analysis for another analysis

847
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:33,678
for another reason but you're paying a

848
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:35,479
lot of money for these products so if

849
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:37,100
you're using a lot of any of these

850
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,630
things it might be worth doing your own

851
00:32:37,099 --> 00:32:40,548
independent testing or if there's any

852
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:42,320
product that you're using a lot of go

853
00:32:40,548 --> 00:32:43,519
ahead and spend a few bucks get some

854
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:44,899
microbial testing on it and make sure

855
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:46,429
you're actually getting what you think

856
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:50,659
you're getting when you're buying that

857
00:32:46,429 --> 00:32:52,669
product off the shelf this is from that

858
00:32:50,659 --> 00:32:54,049
pumpkin Pro product he posts this on his

859
00:32:52,669 --> 00:32:56,900
website in which one of the reasons I

860
00:32:54,048 --> 00:32:58,460
like to talk and promote him is he has

861
00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:01,580
this testing you know it's from December

862
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:03,710
7th 2016 what's actually in his product

863
00:33:01,579 --> 00:33:05,389
it was tested independently this is what

864
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:07,548
I like I expect from manufacturers that

865
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:09,200
are selling microbial products is that

866
00:33:07,548 --> 00:33:10,429
they're doing this testing for you and I

867
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:13,308
think it's perfectly reasonable to ask

868
00:33:10,429 --> 00:33:17,440
and request independent test lab testing

869
00:33:13,308 --> 00:33:19,000
on products like this so

870
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,740
I want to just look at a couple other

871
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,378
products give you some some other

872
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:25,569
comparisons on costs and value so

873
00:33:23,378 --> 00:33:27,819
strapped by Botanica is blackstrap

874
00:33:25,569 --> 00:33:30,339
molasses unsold food blackstrap molasses

875
00:33:27,819 --> 00:33:33,788
45 95 for a two and half gallon retail

876
00:33:30,339 --> 00:33:35,888
bud candy from vamps nutrients 1 69 98

877
00:33:33,788 --> 00:33:37,388
for a 2 enough gallon bucket I know at

878
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:38,798
our feed store this is our prices

879
00:33:37,388 --> 00:33:40,689
depending on where you live you may be

880
00:33:38,798 --> 00:33:42,638
able to find it even cheaper we saw a

881
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:46,058
three and a half gallon bucket for $27

882
00:33:42,638 --> 00:33:47,888
and a 50 gallon drum for 225 we're

883
00:33:46,058 --> 00:33:49,210
sourcing it out the egg industry again

884
00:33:47,888 --> 00:33:51,459
these are things that if you choose to

885
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:52,960
use them in your gardening you may just

886
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:55,629
want to start looking other places and

887
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,950
see where you can find them seaweed

888
00:33:55,628 --> 00:33:59,459
another great thing like we already

889
00:33:56,950 --> 00:34:02,590
talked about all the benefits of seaweed

890
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:04,210
this is all cold water processed

891
00:34:02,589 --> 00:34:07,028
Aska phylum nodosum which is north

892
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:09,579
atlantic sea kelp prices range from 56

893
00:34:07,028 --> 00:34:12,280
55 56 dollars up to 62 dollars a gallon

894
00:34:09,579 --> 00:34:15,399
you can buy your own seaweed extract

895
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:16,629
powder for 15 to 20 dollars a pound it's

896
00:34:15,398 --> 00:34:18,429
going to cost you about 20 cents per

897
00:34:16,628 --> 00:34:20,918
gallon if you're buying in bulk like a

898
00:34:18,429 --> 00:34:23,289
forty four pound box you can get that

899
00:34:20,918 --> 00:34:25,480
price down to around eight dollars a

900
00:34:23,289 --> 00:34:27,338
pound which cuts you down to like five

901
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,750
to ten cents a gallon really really

902
00:34:27,338 --> 00:34:30,578
affordable no reason you can't mix your

903
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:32,500
own seaweed water make your own product

904
00:34:30,579 --> 00:34:35,710
you're literally only using a quarter

905
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:37,869
teaspoon per gallon keema gases

906
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:39,579
wonderful key leaders they bond with the

907
00:34:37,869 --> 00:34:42,970
minerals in our soil and help make them

908
00:34:39,579 --> 00:34:44,649
plants available diamond black is six

909
00:34:42,969 --> 00:34:47,108

911

912
00:34:50,739 --> 00:34:54,608
around 12 to 15 dollars a pound

913

eighty-five percent by content it's a

914

915
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:01,150
and a half cents a gallon or less

916
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:02,619
by Oleg is another company that has

917
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:04,869
really good quemic assets that are quite

918
00:35:02,619 --> 00:35:06,009
affordable so just take a look around

919
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:07,869
and make sure you're looking at the

920
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:09,160
labels to see what percentages are on

921
00:35:07,869 --> 00:35:12,579
there what you're actually getting for

922
00:35:09,159 --> 00:35:14,109
your money the last point that I think

923
00:35:12,579 --> 00:35:16,210
is really really important is have a

924
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:18,519
test garden all right this will more

925
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:20,559
than pay for itself over time I can't

926
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:21,639
tell you how many times I meet growers

927
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:23,920
and they came up to me they're like oh

928
00:35:21,639 --> 00:35:26,619
you got to try this product and product

929
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:28,750
X will be this amazing thing you know

930
00:35:26,619 --> 00:35:30,400
they got 20% more growth over there over

931
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:32,710
their crop before and I asked them well

932
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,150
did you have any controls like did you

933
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:36,789
change the humidity in the room did you

934
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:38,289
change your watering practices no but we

935
00:35:36,789 --> 00:35:40,449
switched we switch lighting companies

936
00:35:38,289 --> 00:35:42,730
that year so how do I know if it was

937
00:35:40,449 --> 00:35:44,189
product X or the lighting or some other

938
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:46,210
thing or they made you five different

939
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:47,829
nutrient samples that they picked up at

940
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:49,059
a trade show like today and then they

941
00:35:47,829 --> 00:35:51,639
don't know which of the five actually

942
00:35:49,059 --> 00:35:53,619
I'd benefit and maybe maybe for the five

943
00:35:51,639 --> 00:35:55,299
actually we're detrimental for your crop

944
00:35:53,619 --> 00:35:56,739
and the fifth one was just amazing

945
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:58,510
there's no way to know if you don't have

946
00:35:56,739 --> 00:36:00,250
controls that means you have to be able

947
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:02,830
to replicate this experiment over and

948
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:05,590
over again and only change one thing in

949
00:36:02,829 --> 00:36:07,630
your grow cycle so if you're setting up

950
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:10,059
a test garden that means that one

951
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:11,980
section and I I don't mean just one

952
00:36:10,059 --> 00:36:14,829
plant you want to have you know maybe 10

953
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:17,650
to 15 plants or an area would receive

954
00:36:14,829 --> 00:36:19,690
one change from the rest of your entire

955
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:22,180
crop so your control can be how you

956
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:24,880
normally grow your plants and then your

957
00:36:22,179 --> 00:36:26,799
test garden can be whatever new idea or

958
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,059
a new thing you want to test so all of

959
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,800
these principles I selected two I

960
00:36:28,059 --> 00:36:31,570
mentioned today those are things you can

961
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,860
test out yourself to see if it works for

962
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:35,200
you in your garden it doesn't have to be

963
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:37,240
expensive you can dedicate just a small

964
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:38,529
portion of your garden to trying some of

965
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:40,419
these concepts out but again really

966
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:42,310
really important that we use scientific

967
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:44,170
method experimental design and have

968
00:36:42,309 --> 00:36:45,480
controls so we know what our variables

969
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:47,519
are

970
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:50,159
now in terms of whether or not this

971
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:52,980
process works companies like gold leaf

972
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:55,289
gardens here in Washington has an

973
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:56,849
amazing amazing brand going they're

974
00:36:55,289 --> 00:36:59,309
known for their high quality cannabis

975
00:36:56,849 --> 00:37:01,858
products in top-shelf shower flower and

976
00:36:59,309 --> 00:37:03,750
they get they get top dollar for what

977
00:37:01,858 --> 00:37:05,940
they're growing high five farms and fire

978
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:09,260
down in Oregon are two really

979
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:11,639
progressive sustainable and

980
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:14,010
environmentally friendly brands that are

981
00:37:11,639 --> 00:37:15,769
doing a great job also getting that top

982
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:17,609
dollar in the market because people know

983
00:37:15,769 --> 00:37:19,710
what they're growing they know they're

984
00:37:17,608 --> 00:37:22,769
organic and they're able to keep their

985
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:24,358
production levels at optimal levels

986
00:37:22,769 --> 00:37:27,329
because they're they're incorporating a

987
00:37:24,358 --> 00:37:28,619
lot of these principles so these are

988
00:37:27,329 --> 00:37:31,739
just some photos extra photos I have

989
00:37:28,619 --> 00:37:35,880
from fire that they shared with me all

990
00:37:31,739 --> 00:37:38,069
these were growing organically and just

991
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:39,539
to sum it up these are sort of the main

992
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:40,980
points of what I wanted to get across to

993
00:37:39,539 --> 00:37:43,259
you today please consider growing

994
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:45,059
organically if you do increase the

995
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:46,980
microbial diversity and biomass in your

996
00:37:45,059 --> 00:37:49,769
soils that means using high quality

997
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:51,960
compost or vermicompost I'm not talking

998
00:37:49,769 --> 00:37:54,570
about $20 municipal compost that you get

999
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:56,670
your local garden center invest in your

1000
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:58,710
soil it makes a huge difference and then

1001
00:37:56,670 --> 00:38:00,030
get a soil test know what your nutrient

1002
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:02,280
levels and mineral levels are in your

1003
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:04,590
soil so you can you can adjust them and

1004
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:06,660
make them optimal for your plant look at

1005
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:08,309
your local garden and farm store and

1006
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:10,049
find out what they have your local AG

1007
00:38:08,309 --> 00:38:12,509
supply you may be able to save tons of

1008
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:14,730
money on a lot of these nutrients and a

1009
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:16,230
lot of these raw amendments take a look

1010
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:17,460
at the ingredients on the labels so you

1011
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:18,840
can start comparing and seeing what

1012
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:21,300
you're actually paying money for and

1013
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:23,519
then lastly try these things out have a

1014
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:24,690
test garden try one thing to see if it

1015
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:25,920
makes a difference you're constantly

1016
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:27,450
learning and evolving and by working

1017
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,639
together we can all share that knowledge

1018
00:38:27,449 --> 00:38:32,609
and improve a lot of the science behind

1019
00:38:29,639 --> 00:38:34,289
cancer cannabis cultivation

1020
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:36,530
so I had today thank you very much for

1021
00:38:34,289 --> 00:38:36,529
your time

1022
00:38:37,329 --> 00:38:42,739
[Applause]

1023
00:38:39,699 --> 00:38:42,739
[Music]

1024
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:46,108
we line up

1025
00:38:47,059 --> 00:38:55,039
[Music]

1026
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:03,650
I really know

1027
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:09,710
[Music]

1028
00:39:13,028 --> 00:39:15,688
yes

1029
00:39:24,949 --> 00:39:29,689
I believe they do have some sort of

1030
00:39:27,349 --> 00:39:31,670
certification the issue there is that

1031
00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:33,650
certification has to have value which

1032
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:35,119
means enough people in the industry have

1033
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:38,269
to be aware of what that certification

1034
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:39,858
means and the other challenge there is

1035
00:39:38,269 --> 00:39:45,259
not all of these certifiers are

1036
00:39:39,858 --> 00:39:46,880
requiring the same standards so you are

1037
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:49,010
right that yes there are there are

1038
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,510
certification agencies and clean green

1039
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:52,849
and certify kind of sort of the two

1040
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:54,589
largest right now I'm hoping that one of

1041
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:55,910
them will gain enough momentum and do

1042
00:39:54,588 --> 00:39:58,190
enough marketing to where they can

1043
00:39:55,909 --> 00:39:59,690
really control the industry so they can

1044
00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:01,190
start like armoury would be a great

1045
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:03,200
example of that armoury is just an

1046
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:05,570
independent certification group they're

1047
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:08,348
not associated with the government but a

1048
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:11,119
lot of people recognize Omri and

1049
00:40:08,349 --> 00:40:13,849
consumers growers give it a perceived

1050
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:15,289
value that allows manufacturers to get a

1051
00:40:13,849 --> 00:40:17,269
little bit more money for that product

1052
00:40:15,289 --> 00:40:19,279
and growers know that it's safe so

1053
00:40:17,269 --> 00:40:20,989
hopefully with cannabis it will be the

1054
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:23,030
same thing where if you go into a store

1055
00:40:20,989 --> 00:40:26,118
and see an area that's certified kind

1056
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:27,410
products or clean green certified you

1057
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:30,170
know that consumer will be willing to

1058
00:40:27,409 --> 00:40:32,690
pay an extra twenty percent say for that

1059
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:34,400
that product and on the back end you

1060
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:36,740
know the growers could get ten to twenty

1061
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:39,789
percent more for the for the value of

1062
00:40:36,739 --> 00:40:39,789
that product by being certified

1063
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:45,550
so I have a question about resources

1064
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:49,570
elements here

1065
00:40:49,789 --> 00:40:54,590
brought us that available online at your

1066
00:40:52,309 --> 00:40:55,579
website or are there resources that

1067
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:58,460
might point

1068
00:40:55,579 --> 00:41:00,710
yeah I posted a I posted a written

1069
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:03,230
transcript on my talk it should be live

1070
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:04,610
at 11:00 of what I was going to talk

1071
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:07,490
about in this talk which had a lot of

1072
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:08,900
those resources so yeah it'll be

1073
00:41:07,489 --> 00:41:10,579
available and I'm a I'm gonna add the

1074
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:13,389
slides down the road so we'll have some

1075
00:41:10,579 --> 00:41:13,389
of those missions as well

1076
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:19,920
resource department of agriculture

1077
00:41:17,659 --> 00:41:21,279
number seven on our series had a

1078
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:24,070
resource department

1079
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:25,480
sure yeah I haven't read a lot mobile

1080
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:27,940
the Oregon Department of Agriculture has

1081
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:29,880
a wonderful website I highly recommend

1082
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:31,869
going there and I have the links to that

1083
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:33,610
in my talk as well

1084
00:41:31,869 --> 00:41:37,389
so yes I do I do recommend that one

1085
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:40,300
Bureau it's the ODA yeah they have a

1086
00:41:37,389 --> 00:41:44,440
cannabis section and they also have a

1087
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:46,510
pesticide advisory section as well in

1088
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:48,730
addition to that I also run a forum with

1089
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:50,920
Tim Wilson it's a free form there's no

1090
00:41:48,730 --> 00:41:54,159
advertising on there it's logical

1091
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:57,130
gardener org and it's all primarily

1092
00:41:54,159 --> 00:41:59,049
science-based horticulture covering a

1093
00:41:57,130 --> 00:42:01,510
variety of topics from permaculture to

1094
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:03,250
gardening it's not necessarily cannabis

1095
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:05,530
focus but there is a medicinal plant

1096
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:09,730
section where there is talk on cannabis

1097
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:12,440
cultivation yeah

1098
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:14,240
logical gardener dot o-r-g and it's on

1099
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:18,619
it's in the link section on our website

1100
00:42:14,239 --> 00:42:21,069
too if you go to kiss organics com other

1101
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:21,069
question

1102
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:28,820
challenges

1103
00:42:31,389 --> 00:42:40,328
oh boy not really I I wouldn't gave a

1104
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:42,880
talk on compost teas in on Kauai about a

1105
00:42:40,329 --> 00:42:44,230
decade ago and I found that I was

1106
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:46,930
totally out of my element because the

1107
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:48,548
environment was so different I think a

1108
00:42:46,929 --> 00:42:51,338
lot of these principles are still very

1109
00:42:48,548 --> 00:42:53,710
sound but in terms of soil structure and

1110
00:42:51,338 --> 00:42:55,538
and all the composition all of that I

1111
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:57,789
could look at a soil test and maybe give

1112
00:42:55,539 --> 00:43:00,519
you analysis but I'm not as familiar

1113
00:42:57,789 --> 00:43:02,170
with those areas so it would be good to

1114
00:43:00,518 --> 00:43:03,729
connect with someone locally than a

1115
00:43:02,170 --> 00:43:05,170
local farmer for example that's been

1116
00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:07,559
growing in those soils that could give

1117
00:43:05,170 --> 00:43:07,559
you more information

1118
00:43:14,679 --> 00:43:18,809
okay Patti

1119
00:43:26,679 --> 00:43:29,279
yeah

1120
00:43:29,969 --> 00:43:33,359
burn him

1121
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:40,730
not really I found even in Seattle

1122
00:43:38,239 --> 00:43:43,639
having a shade cloth over our tomatoes

1123
00:43:40,730 --> 00:43:45,320
for example in our greenhouse made a

1124
00:43:43,639 --> 00:43:47,869
huge difference in controlling the

1125
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:49,220
temperature and we didn't see any any

1126
00:43:47,869 --> 00:43:51,589
reduction in growth rate over the

1127
00:43:49,219 --> 00:43:53,989
tomatoes that were being the in terms of

1128
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:56,210
the UV exposure from the other the other

1129
00:43:53,989 --> 00:43:57,829
tomatoes in our greenhouse but it wasn't

1130
00:43:56,210 --> 00:44:00,710
anything that was terribly scientific it

1131
00:43:57,829 --> 00:44:03,259
was just an observation so I would I

1132
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:04,820
would tour some tomato greenhouses and

1133
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:05,720
how to see how they're controlling our

1134
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:06,950
pepper green now is how they're

1135
00:44:05,719 --> 00:44:09,109
controlling temperature and humidity

1136
00:44:06,949 --> 00:44:14,109
that's really your best resource I think

1137
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:17,399
yeah anyone else

1138
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:17,399
[Music]

1139
00:44:19,389 --> 00:44:22,389
that

1140
00:44:29,429 --> 00:44:37,809
Russert life yes I think it depends on

1141
00:44:36,159 --> 00:44:41,349
what stage of plant growth you or your

1142
00:44:37,809 --> 00:44:42,940
in I think keeping a clean room and

1143
00:44:41,349 --> 00:44:46,269
those protocols are really important and

1144
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:49,450
then having a preventive bug program

1145
00:44:46,269 --> 00:44:50,920
which I know you guys do as well it

1146
00:44:49,449 --> 00:44:52,329
would be a combination of initially

1147
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:54,970
doing some spraying some foliar

1148
00:44:52,329 --> 00:44:57,699
applications with horticultural oils to

1149
00:44:54,969 --> 00:44:58,869
control and maybe knock down the bug

1150
00:44:57,699 --> 00:45:02,529
population then bringing in some

1151
00:44:58,869 --> 00:45:04,599
beneficials and you may find I think

1152
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:06,880
with organics that the plant is does

1153
00:45:04,599 --> 00:45:08,920
have other you know microbial

1154
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:12,280
interactions that will help potentially

1155
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:14,730
with plant defense but yeah it is a

1156
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:16,630
challenge it's not I'm not saying that

1157
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:18,550
growing organically makes all these

1158
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:20,200
pathogens go away it's it's something

1159
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:22,690
that you're still dealing with but I

1160
00:45:20,199 --> 00:45:25,210
think you can consider still reusing

1161
00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:26,200
soil in facilities even when you are

1162
00:45:25,210 --> 00:45:28,470
dealing with a lot of these problems

1163
00:45:26,199 --> 00:45:30,339
because we have had growers that have

1164
00:45:28,469 --> 00:45:32,019
everything under the Sun the only thing

1165
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:34,450
we haven't found a solution for you to

1166
00:45:32,019 --> 00:45:37,960
be totally honest is this root nematode

1167
00:45:34,449 --> 00:45:40,058
that it's just once it got a holding

1168
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:42,099
this one garden we were unable to

1169
00:45:40,059 --> 00:45:43,569
throughout the soil but that soil was

1170
00:45:42,099 --> 00:45:44,890
about four years old so the grower was

1171
00:45:43,568 --> 00:45:47,608
willing to do that because they'd still

1172
00:45:44,889 --> 00:45:49,900
gotten their ROI on it at that point

1173
00:45:47,608 --> 00:45:52,119
honestly the best thing is not don't

1174
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:54,400
take in new plants I can't tell you how

1175
00:45:52,119 --> 00:45:55,028
many times I hear oh yeah I got these

1176
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:58,509
from a buddy

1177
00:45:55,028 --> 00:46:11,338
this new genetics and now I have you

1178
00:45:58,509 --> 00:46:11,338
name it yeah yes yes

1179
00:46:15,619 --> 00:46:21,000
yeah so asking if taking an organic soil

1180
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:22,440
can be bad definitely yes you can be

1181
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,869
bring it to a whole nother vector for

1182
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:25,858
bringing in insects and diseases and one

1183
00:46:24,869 --> 00:46:29,070
thing that you will have to deal with

1184
00:46:25,858 --> 00:46:30,750
with organic soils is fungus gnats it's

1185
00:46:29,070 --> 00:46:32,609
it's unavoidable anytime you have that

1186
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:34,108
amount of organic matter but those are

1187
00:46:32,608 --> 00:46:35,489
fortunately really easy to treat and

1188
00:46:34,108 --> 00:46:37,619
control relative to a lot of these other

1189
00:46:35,489 --> 00:46:39,989
pests so it is important that wherever

1190
00:46:37,619 --> 00:46:41,309
you're getting your soil or if you're

1191
00:46:39,989 --> 00:46:43,079
mixing your own soil that it's coming

1192
00:46:41,309 --> 00:46:45,150
from a clean facility or a clean place

1193
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:50,369
to where you're not bringing in any any

1194
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:52,500
of these pests and diseases yeah yeah

1195
00:46:50,369 --> 00:46:54,920
it's another potential vector just like

1196
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:54,920
anything else

1197
00:47:00,070 --> 00:47:05,680
you know there are some people that are

1198
00:47:02,179 --> 00:47:07,879
foliar feeding with compost teas I

1199
00:47:05,679 --> 00:47:10,250
personally use them as Sola drenches to

1200
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:12,470
increase nutrient cycling there's mixed

1201
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:15,230
data and research in regards to using

1202
00:47:12,469 --> 00:47:16,639
them for disease prevention so I choose

1203
00:47:15,230 --> 00:47:20,300
not to mention for that because it also

1204
00:47:16,639 --> 00:47:22,309
brings up the whole issue of claiming

1205
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:24,109
that these teas are pesticidal which

1206
00:47:22,309 --> 00:47:27,710
brings in the EPA and a whole lot of

1207
00:47:24,108 --> 00:47:29,420
regulations so it's worth experimenting

1208
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:31,010
with it the one issue with a lot of

1209
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:33,800
these teas too though is that they're

1210
00:47:31,010 --> 00:47:35,119
not they're not consistent you can't

1211
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:36,530
you're not going to get the same compost

1212
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:38,210
tea every time you brew it's going to be

1213
00:47:36,530 --> 00:47:39,980
slightly different and in fact you can

1214
00:47:38,210 --> 00:47:43,309
change those microbial communities quite

1215
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:45,460
a bit just by adjusting how long you're

1216
00:47:43,309 --> 00:47:47,389
brewing or what your food sources so

1217
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:49,820
there are some studies that show that

1218
00:47:47,389 --> 00:47:52,489
seaweed has actually helped has

1219
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:54,559
contained some pesticidal properties in

1220
00:47:52,489 --> 00:47:58,759
that regard but it's that would be

1221
00:47:54,559 --> 00:48:00,500
something one experiment with yeah

1222
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:03,010
okay once again you tell us what Putin

1223
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:06,809
Syrian and

1224
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:12,180
okay I don't know our exact booth number

1225
00:48:06,809 --> 00:48:12,179
you set me up for that one yeah you did

1226
00:48:15,650 --> 00:48:20,670
thank you

1227
00:48:17,449 --> 00:48:20,669
