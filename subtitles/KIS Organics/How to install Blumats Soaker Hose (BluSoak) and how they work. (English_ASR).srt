00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:06,028
hey guys Todd Hussey here with kiss

2
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:08,009
organics and I'm here today to talk to

3
00:00:06,028 --> 00:00:09,779
you about blue mats now if you're

4
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:12,269
unfamiliar with blue mats what they are

5
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:13,859
is an automatic watering system

6
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:15,750
it's an irrigation system that works

7
00:00:13,859 --> 00:00:18,000
without the need for electricity and

8
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:20,039
keeps your plants an optimal moisture

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,740
contents throughout the grow and you can

10
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:25,170
you can adjust these levels yourself and

11
00:00:22,739 --> 00:00:25,948
it allows you to grow really happy

12
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,810
healthy plants

13
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:29,609
I think watering is one of those things

14
00:00:27,809 --> 00:00:31,229
it gets underappreciated by a lot of

15
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:33,570
growers and overlooked in a lot of cases

16
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,969
and it's one of the most important

17
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,558
things in an organic soil or an organic

18
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:39,689
growing system in terms of your overall

19
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:40,949
plant health and plant growth so what

20
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:42,329
I'm going to do for you today is break

21
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,890
down a little bit more about what blue

22
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:45,750
mats are show you a few different

23
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:49,980
designs and then show you how to install

24
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:52,140
them in your own garden now the first

25
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:53,968
step is to get the soil wet into the

26
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,549
right moisture content as if you had

27
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:59,280
just watered and we're gonna get it set

28
00:00:56,549 --> 00:01:01,649
to what we consider optimal now with

29
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,840
soils like ours like the kiss organic

30
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:05,939
soils that are peat based which is what

31
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,280
is most most potting soils are you're

32
00:01:05,938 --> 00:01:09,989
going to find that this peat can be

33
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,790
hydrophobic which means if it gets

34
00:01:09,989 --> 00:01:13,739
really dry it's not gonna want to accept

35
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,810
water now I'm doing this on a

36
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:18,359
record-breaking day here in Seattle it's

37
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:20,368
like 88 degrees at out so I'm gonna

38
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:22,590
really let this water soak in I'm gonna

39
00:01:20,368 --> 00:01:23,640
water another bed and come back and

40
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,109
water that it's a good watering

41
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,849
technique to know about in general it's

42
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:29,188
called the pulse watering technique you

43
00:01:26,849 --> 00:01:30,118
can look it up but essentially let the

44
00:01:29,188 --> 00:01:31,679
water soak in

45
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:33,118
because peat can get hydrophobic which

46
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,189
means it's not going to want to accept

47
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:37,530
water when it gets really dry and then

48
00:01:35,188 --> 00:01:39,000
come back to that bed and then give it a

49
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,379
little bit more water this is really

50
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,180
important especially when you're doing a

51
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:44,938
container watering over numerous

52
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:47,579
containers now once that water is soaked

53
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:49,859
in and I've got that bed to the optimum

54
00:01:47,578 --> 00:01:51,899
moisture content that I wanted that then

55
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:53,938
I can move on with what I want to do

56
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:57,868
next which is start installing the blue

57
00:01:53,938 --> 00:01:59,459
mats now that I've let the water soak in

58
00:01:57,868 --> 00:02:01,649
a little bit I want to test it to see

59
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:03,449
what kind of moisture content I have I'm

60
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:04,759
gonna dig down a little bit to see make

61
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:07,320
sure that the water is actually

62
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:08,729
penetrated beyond the first inch or so

63
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:10,590
and then it's actually down there and

64
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:12,930
then I'm gonna squeeze it not quite

65
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,920
enough to get a drop out of it that's

66
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,330
what I'm looking for

67
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:17,789
goodness just slowly want to break apart

68
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:19,080
there and if you do have a digital

69
00:02:17,789 --> 00:02:22,019
moisture meter it makes it really easy

70
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,730
we want to aim for a hundred mbar this

71
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:25,800
is the digital moisture meter from bloom

72
00:02:23,729 --> 00:02:28,769
at there are about fifty bucks and they

73
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:31,050
work really really well after I've done

74
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:32,370
that I'm gonna be soaking my sensors now

75
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:34,800
this is something you'll want to start

76
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:37,050
doing while you're wetting the beds and

77
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,239
doing everything else so I let them sit

78
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:41,550
for a couple hours and now I'm putting

79
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:43,530
them together what I what I'm doing

80
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:45,209
right here is getting all of the air out

81
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:48,689
and attaching them down below so you

82
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:50,489
don't want any air inside the bloom at

83
00:02:48,689 --> 00:02:53,068
sensor itself and I'm tapping it to

84
00:02:50,489 --> 00:02:55,170
remove any micro air bubbles in both of

85
00:02:53,068 --> 00:02:58,500
the can both the top and the bottom cone

86
00:02:55,169 --> 00:03:06,329
and then attaching them below below the

87
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:07,860
water level it's really that simple the

88
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:10,769
next thing I'm going to do is attach the

89
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:12,720
pressure reducer to my hose and then in

90
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:14,539
this case I also showed the optional

91
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:17,489
filter now if you're using tap water

92
00:03:14,539 --> 00:03:19,919
from a municipal source like I am it's

93
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:25,049
probably not necessary you can just go

94
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:26,488
straight off of the pressure reducer so

95
00:03:25,049 --> 00:03:28,500
the first step is coming off of the

96
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:30,299
pressure reducer with an eight

97
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,280
millimeter line in this case I'm using

98
00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:34,409
the black tubing they also have an

99
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:37,140
orange Superflex tubing that you can get

100
00:03:34,409 --> 00:03:39,539
if you are in an area that you're crazy

101
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:41,189
to move around more corners and such but

102
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:43,769
for my intents and purposes the black

103
00:03:41,189 --> 00:03:46,469
line works just fine and it blends in

104
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:48,120
with my bed better so the first step is

105
00:03:46,469 --> 00:03:50,729
deciding where you want the sensor in

106
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:53,549
the bed so in my case I'm putting the

107
00:03:50,729 --> 00:03:55,139
sensor near probably about four or five

108
00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:58,260
inches away from the base of my tomato

109
00:03:55,139 --> 00:04:00,539
plant so that way I know that if if that

110
00:03:58,259 --> 00:04:02,129
part of the bed needs water it's going

111
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:04,078
to dispense water throughout the entire

112
00:04:02,129 --> 00:04:07,889
line off of that sensor so I just

113
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:10,139
attached the blue silk adaptor to the

114
00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:11,849
blue soak tape and now that blue soap

115
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:15,150
tape essentially works like a soaker

116
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:17,310
hose so I'm running it over and towards

117
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:19,048
my plants so it's gonna get all of the

118
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:21,120
plants that I want it to reach in the

119
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:23,219
bed so it's only going to sense the

120
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,430
moisture wherever I put that carrot that

121
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:27,690
blue mat sensor everything else is just

122
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:30,629
going to go off of

123
00:04:27,689 --> 00:04:34,199
point so originally I decided I was

124
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:35,909
gonna run it underneath the tomato cage

125
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:37,560
and then I end up coming back here in a

126
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:39,360
second as you'll see and pulling it back

127
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,220
out and putting it over the top but

128
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,810
ideally you want to have your design and

129
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:44,250
your layout figured out early and you

130
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:46,379
want to install it when your plants are

131
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:48,480
small now one thing about these systems

132
00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:52,409
when you do first put in a smaller plant

133
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:54,180
is you may need to water hand water over

134
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:56,130
the top until that plant gets

135
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,560
established in the soil and has a larger

136
00:04:56,129 --> 00:05:01,139
root ball and ability to pull more

137
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:04,019
moisture out of the soil but in this

138
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:06,029
case my plants are obviously maturing

139
00:05:04,019 --> 00:05:07,620
they're fairly large I'm not worried

140
00:05:06,029 --> 00:05:10,859
about them getting adequate and water

141
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:13,050
you know doing it this way so I'm laying

142
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:14,699
out my line I measured out about half of

143
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:16,949
it here because I need to loop it back

144
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:19,620
around so one thing that you have to

145
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:22,110
remember is it's only going to measure

146
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:23,550
wherever that bloom at carat or sensor

147
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:25,830
is so you need to make sure that you

148
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:28,770
come back around with your bloom at tape

149
00:05:25,829 --> 00:05:31,109
or the blue soak tape to get within four

150
00:05:28,769 --> 00:05:33,779
to six inches I'd like to go four to

151
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:36,180
five inches I'd say even to that sensor

152
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:38,250
itself the other way you can do that I

153
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:40,769
know bloom at themselves recommend

154
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:42,569
putting in a distribution dripper right

155
00:05:40,769 --> 00:05:44,849
off of the end there before you put in

156
00:05:42,569 --> 00:05:47,310
the three mil millon three millimeter

157
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:50,750
adapter but I've found that it works

158
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:52,980
better for me without using that and so

159
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:55,829
what you can't see right here is I'm now

160
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:57,390
putting on the end cap to the blue so

161
00:05:55,829 --> 00:05:59,519
tape that keeps that keeps it from

162
00:05:57,389 --> 00:06:01,529
coming out the other end and just laying

163
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:03,629
it down right there wrapping it back

164
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:06,119
around to that green sensor that I put

165
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:07,439
underneath the base of that tomato so

166
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,449
now it's going to water all three of

167
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:13,430
those tomatoes the cucumbers and the

168
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:15,599
flowers off of that one sensor alone and

169
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:17,910
there's so many different ways you can

170
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,220
do this design I'll show you a bunch of

171
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:22,830
different options here I did three of my

172
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:24,300
beds in this video so you can kind of

173
00:06:22,829 --> 00:06:26,129
see the different ways I gave a few

174
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,660
different ways of doing it but really

175
00:06:26,129 --> 00:06:29,339
you'll want to figure out what design

176
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:31,380
works best for you and your crop

177
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:32,939
depending on you know how thorough do

178
00:06:31,379 --> 00:06:35,219
you need it to water how much of the bed

179
00:06:32,939 --> 00:06:37,379
you need to cover and that's really

180
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:39,840
going to decide based off of your budget

181
00:06:37,379 --> 00:06:41,519
the value of your crop and how you lay

182
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:43,948
it out but really important always

183
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:45,359
overestimate the length that you think

184
00:06:43,949 --> 00:06:48,478
you need so you don't have to reorder

185
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,860
parts and just make be very thoughtful

186
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:51,839
about the way that you're laying it out

187
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:53,759
ahead of time but once you have a design

188
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:55,848
figured out it's really really easy to

189
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,750
set up

190
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:59,098
all right I've gone ahead and fast

191
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,930
forwarded to save you the time of

192
00:06:59,098 --> 00:07:02,519
watching me lay out all the lines but

193
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:05,069
essentially what I did was I put another

194
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:08,878
sensor in that corner closest to the

195
00:07:05,069 --> 00:07:11,009
back left tomato plant and then ran the

196
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:13,050
blue soap all the way down and around

197
00:07:11,009 --> 00:07:15,030
the all the plants in the bed and then

198
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:17,430
back to that sensor again ending about

199
00:07:15,029 --> 00:07:19,318
four to five inches away from the sensor

200
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:21,509
because it's really important that the

201
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:24,180
sensor the area around the sensor gets

202
00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:25,348
moisture the same as the rest of the

203
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:27,449
roots and the rest of the plant because

204
00:07:25,348 --> 00:07:29,848
that's what's gonna put water out and

205
00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:35,189
sense when to release water into the

206
00:07:29,848 --> 00:07:36,718
soaker hose itself and you can't really

207
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:39,810
see it but what I'm doing now is I'm

208
00:07:36,718 --> 00:07:42,478
attaching the end of the line there so

209
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:44,218
this is my last bed and so off of those

210
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:46,500
eight millimeter sensors you actually

211
00:07:44,218 --> 00:07:48,329
have it's it's sort of a pass through so

212
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,889
you have one end in and one end out now

213
00:07:48,329 --> 00:07:51,750
the end coming out of that eight

214
00:07:49,889 --> 00:07:53,819
millimeter line I need to cap because

215
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:56,399
otherwise water would just flow right

216
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:58,139
out of it and so I'm just putting a cap

217
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:59,579
on there right now to show that I'm

218
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:03,680
ending the line and I'll show you a

219
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:03,680
visual of that as well here in a second

220
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:08,420
so here's a quick shot just to show the

221
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:10,400
aesthetics of the bed in my case here I

222
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:12,170
put a 90 degree angle on the eight

223
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:14,839
millimeter line so I get a nice clean

224
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:17,420
line down and then just sent it down the

225
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:22,159
bed and then under the gravel and then

226
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:24,560
back up down the next bed so here's a

227
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:27,590
close-up of what the sensor looks like

228
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:30,439
and you can see how I ran the end of the

229
00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:33,679
blue soak tape line back over to the

230
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:36,200
sensor itself so this way I will make

231
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,668
sure to keep that area moist and it'll

232
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,910
keep everything wet and watered but you

233
00:08:37,668 --> 00:08:43,189
see you have the blue mat sensor

234
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:45,620
connected to a three millimeter adapter

235
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:47,180
to the blue soak tape and then the blue

236
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:49,940
soak tape that goes around the bed

237
00:08:47,179 --> 00:08:52,459
looping back around and then ending

238
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:54,980
underneath the stake with a blue cap a

239
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:56,600
blue soak cap and then the other line

240
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:58,909
you see in there is just the black eight

241
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:01,570
millimeter line that connects my blue

242
00:08:58,909 --> 00:09:01,569
mat sensors

243
00:09:03,389 --> 00:09:07,330
here's another visual the same thing

244
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:11,039
just from a different angle to give you

245
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:11,040
guys another view of what's going on

246
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:17,970
and here's an end of that blue soaked

247
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:20,550
end cap so you can see it actually just

248
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:22,560
screws on to the end you just put it

249
00:09:20,549 --> 00:09:25,039
right inside the sleeve and it fits on

250
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:25,039
really nice

251
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:30,639
so this was my pepper bed I did

252
00:09:29,139 --> 00:09:33,189
something a little funky here I decided

253
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:35,409
to loop around the plant completely and

254
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:37,510
make sure that I got good coverage right

255
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:39,549
around my peppers without watering the

256
00:09:37,509 --> 00:09:42,338
West rest of the bed because this bed is

257
00:09:39,549 --> 00:09:44,439
going to be under that hoop house

258
00:09:42,339 --> 00:09:47,230
plastic it's a little harder for me to

259
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:48,850
get in there and weed so by putting the

260
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:50,409
soaker hose just around the base of the

261
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:51,700
plant I'm hoping to reduce my weed

262
00:09:50,409 --> 00:09:53,079
pressure in the middle of the bed

263
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:55,300
because that area doesn't need to stay

264
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:57,910
as wet and also make sure that my

265
00:09:55,299 --> 00:09:59,169
peppers get really really good water

266
00:09:57,909 --> 00:10:00,939
throughout the season because it's going

267
00:09:59,169 --> 00:10:03,490
to be super hot under there and I want

268
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:05,920
to grow some awesome peppers I've also

269
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:08,259
extended it out to get the thyme and the

270
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:09,759
sage at the end of the bed so those are

271
00:10:08,259 --> 00:10:13,528
getting good water too by running the

272
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:13,528
soaker hose over by the root systems

273
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:19,409
so here's a couple more traditional

274
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:22,050
designs that I've seen people use either

275
00:10:19,409 --> 00:10:24,569
that spiral design going out to cover

276
00:10:22,049 --> 00:10:26,519
about a four by four space or this sort

277
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:28,650
of back to back and forth wavy design

278
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:30,600
that I used on the other side so either

279
00:10:28,649 --> 00:10:33,120
works really well it kind of depends on

280
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,139
your layout of plants and what kind of

281
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,929
coverage you're trying to get in the

282
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:38,009
area but here's just two more options to

283
00:10:36,929 --> 00:10:42,689
consider when you're laying out your

284
00:10:38,009 --> 00:10:45,090
blue mats so this is the soaker hose

285
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:47,370
here once I opened up the carrots it's

286
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:49,379
around a pepper right now and you can

287
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:51,240
see the water coming out of the soaker

288
00:10:49,379 --> 00:10:53,669
hose itself this is what it will look

289
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,529
like when it's dispensing water now this

290
00:10:53,669 --> 00:10:58,019
is where the sensor comes in because as

291
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:59,610
you close down the sensor and adjust it

292
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:01,889
which I'll demonstrate here in a second

293
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:03,899
it will maintain that moisture content

294
00:11:01,889 --> 00:11:06,090
at whatever level you set it at so for

295
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:08,009
this soil because I know what it is it's

296
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:10,379
a it's a peat based soil that we make

297
00:11:08,009 --> 00:11:12,240
ourselves we really like to keep it at

298
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:13,259
right at 100 mbar so that's what I'm

299
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,409
going to aim for and that's what I'm

300
00:11:13,259 --> 00:11:18,120
going to set my sensors at now rain or

301
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:19,919
shine these things are working for you

302
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,870
day or night so your plant always gets

303
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:24,750
an even moisture level which is so

304
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:25,200
important for plant health so if it for

305
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,419
example

306
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,400
rains the next day those sensors will

307
00:11:27,419 --> 00:11:32,579
shut off and so we won't get more water

308
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:34,319
into the soaker hose until the plant

309
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:36,830
needs it until that soil starts drying

310
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,830
out again

311
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:42,669
now the soaker hoses are great but

312
00:11:40,929 --> 00:11:43,809
they're not for everyone some people are

313
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:46,509
going to want to use distribution

314
00:11:43,809 --> 00:11:48,789
drippers and the distribution drippers

315
00:11:46,509 --> 00:11:50,439
are the little brown things with the

316
00:11:48,789 --> 00:11:53,169
black tip that you can see in this photo

317
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:55,300
you can put up to five per bloom at

318
00:11:53,169 --> 00:11:57,669
sensor and they work really well if

319
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:59,379
you're dealing with containers say like

320
00:11:57,669 --> 00:12:00,579
a five gallon container or a ten gallon

321
00:11:59,379 --> 00:12:02,009
tank container because you can put a

322
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:04,660
sensor in and then run those

323
00:12:02,009 --> 00:12:09,129
distribution zippers around the base of

324
00:12:04,659 --> 00:12:11,259
the plant alright we're on to the final

325
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:12,970
step here and that's dialing in your

326
00:12:11,259 --> 00:12:15,909
blue mats and getting the sensor set up

327
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:17,800
so I'm going ahead and closing up the

328
00:12:15,909 --> 00:12:19,569
sensor because I had it open overnight

329
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:21,759
it doesn't put out enough water to where

330
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:23,410
I was concerned about over watering some

331
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:24,309
people even run these without sensors

332
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:26,019
all the time

333
00:12:24,309 --> 00:12:28,239
so you don't even need them in some

334
00:12:26,019 --> 00:12:30,279
instances but the first thing to do is

335
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,570
as you open it up if you're if you open

336
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:33,429
it all the way up and don't get any

337
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:35,020
water there could be a little kink there

338
00:12:33,429 --> 00:12:37,029
in your three millimeter lines sometimes

339
00:12:35,019 --> 00:12:39,610
that rubber gets stuck together so

340
00:12:37,029 --> 00:12:41,409
you'll just need to slide the line in or

341
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:43,269
out a little bit and just on kink it now

342
00:12:41,409 --> 00:12:46,629
in this case you can see it's not kinked

343
00:12:43,269 --> 00:12:48,579
so all I'm going to do here is let it

344
00:12:46,629 --> 00:12:50,649
get to where it's just dripping and I

345
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:53,080
want to have a drip just hanging there

346
00:12:50,649 --> 00:12:55,090
at the top that's when I know I have it

347
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:57,610
at the right level so there we go you

348
00:12:55,090 --> 00:13:00,610
can see I'm almost there and I just want

349
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:02,470
to get that drip hanging right there now

350
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:04,060
what I'm going to do is look on the side

351
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:06,910
of the blue mat there are these little

352
00:13:04,059 --> 00:13:12,579
arrows and I'm going to move over one

353
00:13:06,909 --> 00:13:14,649
two two arrows tighter so clockwise one

354
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:16,270
two two arrows now it really just

355
00:13:14,649 --> 00:13:18,579
depends on how wet you want the soil to

356
00:13:16,269 --> 00:13:19,990
be so in my case I only did one arrow

357
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:22,509
because I wanted to keep the soil a

358
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:25,360
little bit on the wetter side you can

359
00:13:22,509 --> 00:13:28,120
also do two arrows but it also depends

360
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,190
on where you set the how moist your bed

361
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,600
is at the time of setting it and you can

362
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:34,750
use those moisture meters to make

363
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,070
adjustments now what I would do is I'm

364
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,840
gonna leave this and not make an

365
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:40,510
adjustment now for a little while you

366
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:43,480
want to wait at least you know probably

367
00:13:40,509 --> 00:13:45,069
24 hours 12 to 24 hours before coming

368
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,659
back in and measuring with your moisture

369
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:48,490
meter and seeing where your beds at and

370
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:51,039
then if you do make an adjustment make

371
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:51,539
it a small adjustment maybe only one

372
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:53,219
carrot

373
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:54,659
the time so that you're not overdoing it

374
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:56,910
and constantly having to go back and

375
00:13:54,659 --> 00:13:59,219
forth and fix it but provided you don't

376
00:13:56,909 --> 00:14:00,958
bump the sensor it should water your

377
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:03,509
plant for the entire life of that plant

378
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:06,208
now it's really really simple I can't

379
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:07,259
recommend these units enough and feel

380
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:09,659
free to hit me up if you have any

381
