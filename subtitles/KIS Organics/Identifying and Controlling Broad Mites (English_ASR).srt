1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:07,859
can we talk a little bit about broad

2
00:00:03,029 --> 00:00:09,299
mites sure great so what what can you

3
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:11,309
tell me about broad mites I know for a

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,290
while there they were like the latest

5
00:00:11,308 --> 00:00:15,239
spider mite as and they were everyone

6
00:00:13,289 --> 00:00:18,299
was diagnosing all plant problems as

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:22,980
being broad mites yes and in fact I just

8
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:24,300
saw some hemp images that you know it

9
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,649
was like broad my promit but it's not

10
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:29,640
we're pretty sure it's actually

11
00:00:25,649 --> 00:00:32,640
herbicide damage and for outdoor

12
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:35,009
production people have to remember you

13
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,950
know spray drift is an issue and

14
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:40,710
herbicides drift we even had it at my

15
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:42,930
house this year the farm field up back

16
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:45,990
had sprayed and herbicide and it damaged

17
00:00:42,929 --> 00:00:47,399
all our Tomatoes and we had herbicide

18
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:48,780
damage and our Tomatoes which looked

19
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:50,670
like broad my damage cuz I got all

20
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,500
excited thinking yes we've got broad

21
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,750
mites I can take pictures and videos and

22
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,450
it turned out to be herbicide damage so

23
00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:01,019
I was really disappointed so let before

24
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:02,820
we talk about the actual life cycle in

25
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,469
identification for a broad minute what

26
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,260
are we looking for in a plant in terms

27
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:09,689
of damage I have always associated it

28
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:12,420
with sort of like incorrect me because

29
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:14,009
I'm probably wrong but I like twisted

30
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,829
new green growth it's a little bit

31
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:19,728
lighter than it should be in color well

32
00:01:16,829 --> 00:01:23,670
on if you're speaking to cannabis

33
00:01:19,728 --> 00:01:27,239
cannabis actually can have a really high

34
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:28,469
level of broad mites on it before you

35
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:30,209
see damage

36
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:31,978
you know I deal with this in ornamentals

37
00:01:30,209 --> 00:01:34,048
and vegetables too and you just get a

38
00:01:31,978 --> 00:01:36,060
few broad mites feeding on an impatient

39
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:39,330
and the leaf is completely gnarled and

40
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:41,189
destroyed cannabis actually handles this

41
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:43,500
past quite well not that you want it and

42
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:45,030
typically people don't realize they have

43
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,329
it until they do have really high

44
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:49,769
numbers and that's when you see that

45
00:01:47,329 --> 00:01:51,599
slightly distorted growth a little

46
00:01:49,769 --> 00:01:53,459
discoloration you walk by and it's just

47
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:55,679
like yeah it just doesn't quite look

48
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:58,079
right then you put it under your scope

49
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,030
and you're like holy crap you know and

50
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,548
then you know you have them and being

51
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:05,579
this is very what we call cosmopolitan

52
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:07,560
pest being it's it's probably in every

53
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:10,978
local garden center coming from every

54
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:14,199
major greenhouse because it's just been

55
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:17,650
a really bad past the last few years

56
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:19,329
luckily before it hit cannabis we've

57
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:22,750
been working on it a lot in ornamentals

58
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:24,690
and we've had a lot of trials and tests

59
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:27,729
and things we did and we found out

60
00:02:24,689 --> 00:02:30,280
products like the SELEX work extremely

61
00:02:27,729 --> 00:02:31,780
well on it

62
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:35,020
and that in combination with the

63
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:38,110
predatory mite q cámaras and so for a

64
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:40,630
lot of ornamentals now if it's if it's

65
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:42,850
an ornamental that we know can get it we

66
00:02:40,629 --> 00:02:43,239
just treat it with q camaris we just do

67
00:02:42,849 --> 00:02:44,979
it

68
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:50,310
as a preventative and it's basically

69
00:02:44,979 --> 00:02:52,419
stopped the problem in ornamentals so

70
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:55,030
basically what you want to do then

71
00:02:52,419 --> 00:02:57,069
you're saying is treat the plants early

72
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:58,989
on with something like a safar LX to

73
00:02:57,069 --> 00:03:01,269
knock back the populations and then yes

74
00:02:58,989 --> 00:03:03,550
follow up with an application of the

75
00:03:01,269 --> 00:03:07,030
cuckoo mares yeah and I would say QQ

76
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:07,900
mares are so inexpensive I mean you know

77
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:11,289
they're just like a bread and butter

78
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:14,019
product it's easy to get again prices

79
00:03:11,289 --> 00:03:15,789
low on it and Q cámaras being that we

80
00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:18,670
know it does really good on broad might

81
00:03:15,789 --> 00:03:21,759
it will also feed on first instar

82
00:03:18,669 --> 00:03:24,069
Western flour thrips and a few other

83
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:27,519
trip species not all of them but a lot

84
00:03:24,069 --> 00:03:28,959
of them it will snack on spider mite

85
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,610
eggs because this is something that's

86
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,019
been very interesting I'm New Guinean

87
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:35,590
patients we used to have a lot of spider

88
00:03:32,019 --> 00:03:39,069
mite problems on in addition to thrips

89
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:41,349
problems and broad mites once we went to

90
00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:43,060
using the q cámaras program we don't

91
00:03:41,349 --> 00:03:46,239
have spider mite issues anymore on the

92
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:48,879
new guineas and we think that the q

93
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,269
camaris are stopping it before it gets

94
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,759
started

95
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:54,310
I would never recommend Q camaris to

96
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:56,139
treat for spider mites if you have a

97
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:58,150
population already but if there's just

98
00:03:56,139 --> 00:03:59,768
one egg here and there and the Q cámaras

99
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:02,829
find it there's a chance they're gonna

100
00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:04,930
just feed on it but again do not use q

101
00:04:02,829 --> 00:04:07,569
cámaras as a control don't email me

102
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:09,280
saying hey I heard you say use Q camaris

103
00:04:07,569 --> 00:04:09,879
to control spider mites that is not what

104
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,759
I said

105
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:14,680
so when we're targeting broad mites were

106
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:16,899
seeing these side benefits of other

107
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,629
things that will feed on and can stop

108
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:22,239
problems before they start

109
00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:23,469
okay so I'm just gonna say if you're a

110
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,170
cannabis grower and you don't have

111
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:27,940
cucumbers in your program you're crazy

112
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:30,970
all right so if we're talking about

113
00:04:27,939 --> 00:04:33,399
identifying broad mites they're quite

114
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:35,290
small very small and so they're really

115
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:36,699
hard to see you do need a microscope I

116
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:40,300
couldn't see them where the jeweler's

117
00:04:36,699 --> 00:04:42,430
loupe myself what what identifying

118
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:45,550
characteristics and what do we need is

119
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:48,459
tools in the garden for people to be

120
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:50,259
able to really identify them well 60 X

121
00:04:48,459 --> 00:04:51,699
magnification is generally where you

122
00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:54,189
need to be around and this is where

123
00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:56,800
again I love my Dynalite because my eyes

124
00:04:54,189 --> 00:05:00,339
are terrible I'm I have old lady

125
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,800
eyeballs now and I like to be able to

126
00:05:00,339 --> 00:05:04,599
take leaves and sit with my computer

127
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,590
with my Dynalite so it's this giant big

128
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:10,540
screen and then I can you know scan over

129
00:05:08,589 --> 00:05:12,250
the leaf services with the Dynalite and

130
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:15,580
and then be able to see things close up

131
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:17,500
and then take pictures if need be well

132
00:05:15,579 --> 00:05:19,089
one I use them for my classes but for my

133
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,470
growers they can take pictures and then

134
00:05:19,089 --> 00:05:22,750
send them to me if they don't see what

135
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:26,350
something is but the broad mites

136
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:28,689
um they tend to be a little clearer on

137
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:29,860
their bodies and the the key diagnostic

138
00:05:28,689 --> 00:05:31,899
feature we look for are their eggs

139
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:34,509
because they've got little white dots

140
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:37,000
all over their eggs where spider mite

141
00:05:34,509 --> 00:05:40,719
eggs are larger and they're perfectly

142
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,759
round where these if you look they

143
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,560
almost remind me of like golf ball

144
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:47,170
dimples in a way they're very

145
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:51,129
distinctive eggs and if you see those

146
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:52,870
then we know that that's a broad my egg

147
00:05:51,129 --> 00:05:54,370
the other thing broad mites do is the

148
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,360
male's will pick up and carry the

149
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:57,670
females around

150
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,830
so if you see am i running by and then

151
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:01,720
there's a female attached to it or it

152
00:05:59,829 --> 00:06:07,029
looks like two are running along then

153
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:08,530
that's broad might also okay and so what

154
00:06:07,029 --> 00:06:11,669
we're doing is we're sampling off of a

155
00:06:08,529 --> 00:06:14,979
leaf that's probably new growth and then

156
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:18,699
taking that flipping it over and using

157
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:21,400
the Dynalite or a stronger and now I

158
00:06:18,699 --> 00:06:24,009
haven't it's it's over there it's packed

159
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:27,729
to go for my workshop for Saturday the

160
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:29,860
new Dynalite I got is Wireless and so

161
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:31,990
you can have your laptop of your phone

162
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:33,069
setting somewhere you know a bit away

163
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:34,480
and you don't have to worry about the

164
00:06:33,069 --> 00:06:37,449
cable or cord and you're able to

165
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:39,860
manipulate the Dynalite a bit easier to

166
00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:41,360
be able to get into the plant can of

167
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:46,580
and everything if you don't want to cut

168
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:48,830
leaves off so yeah that's cool yeah

169
00:06:46,579 --> 00:06:51,229
they're they're just expensive I love

170
00:06:48,829 --> 00:06:52,250
buying but well but you gotta remember

171
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:55,009
I'm differ

172
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:57,560
this is I'm at a different job than you

173
00:06:55,009 --> 00:06:59,659
are oh for sure I have a very expensive

174
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:01,550
phase-contrast microscope that would be

175
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,700
overkill for any grower you know I get

176
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,079
it

177
00:07:01,699 --> 00:07:06,409
yeah you have to have the right tools

178
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:07,579
for what you're doing yeah okay so in

179
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:09,500
terms of broad mites

180
00:07:07,579 --> 00:07:13,099
you mentioned cuca Maris you mentioned

181
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:15,949
self oil X I will say if you are under

182
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:18,410
warmer growing conditions which often if

183
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:20,599
you're in an in an indoor grow you're

184
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:22,939
not there is the option of using the

185
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:25,280
predatory mites were ski it's a lot more

186
00:07:22,939 --> 00:07:26,839
expensive I always say start with Keuka

187
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:29,089
Maris and if you can get it to work you

188
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:30,949
can save a ton of money if not you can

189
00:07:29,089 --> 00:07:34,579
move in this were ski but generally

190
00:07:30,949 --> 00:07:37,159
Swersky is is for a bit warmer of

191
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:39,620
temperatures or if you're fighting white

192
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:42,200
fly at the same time that you're

193
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:47,420
fighting broad mites because sworsky

194
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:50,120
will also feed on white fly eggs okay

195
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:53,629
and are there any other oil-based

196
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:55,759
options or pesticidal sprays that you

197
00:07:53,629 --> 00:07:57,230
can use that you're aware of for broad

198
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:02,990
mites besides folx

199
00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:05,270
well I have a very good comfort zone

200
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:07,220
with that product because I have had

201
00:08:05,269 --> 00:08:08,990
lots of my growers using it we haven't

202
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:10,700
had any problems with it and we know it

203
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:12,920
works I mean there are lots of other

204
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:17,420
oils you know a lot of the plant

205
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:21,470
botanical based ones but they get very

206
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:23,590
expensive and there needs to be testing

207
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:26,360
to prove they work as well I know there

208
00:08:23,589 --> 00:08:28,039
has been some testing going on comparing

209
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,900
the different oils and the oils do not

210
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,100
all work the same I I don't want to talk

211
00:08:29,899 --> 00:08:32,899
about somebody else's research because

212
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:34,279
he's gonna publish it but the oils do

213
00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:36,799
not work the same there's different

214
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:38,209
particle sizes and I know one of the

215
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,339
things that I'm getting a lot of people

216
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:42,139
are like well some oil X it's a

217
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:44,990
petroleum product we're not going to use

218
00:08:42,139 --> 00:08:47,029
it yes but here's my argument back fine

219
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:51,350
if you want to use things like plant

220
00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:53,389
botanical oils to make those botanical

221
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:55,519
oils how much curb

222
00:08:53,389 --> 00:08:58,129
footprinting and how much petroleum has

223
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,528
to go in to growing all those harvesting

224
00:08:58,129 --> 00:09:02,629
all that to process it to make a small

225
00:09:00,528 --> 00:09:05,389
batch I bet you if you actually looked

226
00:09:02,629 --> 00:09:07,100
at the carbon the the the fossil fuel

227
00:09:05,389 --> 00:09:08,958
inputs to produce those products it's

228
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:12,050
more than just using a jug of the some

229
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:14,899
oil because you think about how much of

230
00:09:12,049 --> 00:09:17,059
these plants I mean how much lavender

231
00:09:14,899 --> 00:09:20,149
how much rosemary how much all that you

232
00:09:17,059 --> 00:09:22,458
have to grow to produce these oils it's

233
00:09:20,149 --> 00:09:24,860
a lot of input and a lot of work to

234
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:27,619
harvest it and and do all that stuff too

235
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:30,139
so just saying that you know when you're

236
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:32,450
looking at you know a 1% spray rate on

237
00:09:30,139 --> 00:09:34,578
some of these products and it's weird

238
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:36,528
because you know people are okay with

239
00:09:34,578 --> 00:09:38,539
driving their cars and putting gasoline

240
00:09:36,528 --> 00:09:40,850
in it but then they've got this weird

241
00:09:38,539 --> 00:09:44,328
thing about using safai LX yeah I've

242
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:46,190
heard that so if we're if we're taking

243
00:09:44,328 --> 00:09:50,269
you know we're starting early on in

244
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:52,250
propagation yep we're dipping our clones

245
00:09:50,269 --> 00:09:54,889
or spraying them with the Ceph aisle and

246
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:57,528
then introducing the cuckoo Maris

247
00:09:54,889 --> 00:10:01,159
hopefully to the crop fairly early on

248
00:09:57,528 --> 00:10:06,350
like you said is that within like a few

249
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:08,659
days a week I mean it's right that thing

250
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:14,389
I mean the next day don't know okay

251
00:10:08,659 --> 00:10:16,129
great okay and then how often should we

252
00:10:14,389 --> 00:10:17,360
be introducing cuckoo Maris because I

253
00:10:16,129 --> 00:10:20,208
assume if there's not enough food

254
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:23,470
they'll die off and then yes well and

255
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:25,609
this is the other thing that you know

256
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:28,070
ornamentals and vegetable guys have kind

257
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:29,180
of accepted instead of spring every week

258
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:30,800
or every two weeks they're releasing

259
00:10:29,179 --> 00:10:32,629
bugs every week or two weeks you're not

260
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:35,000
building a population in there cuz as

261
00:10:32,629 --> 00:10:37,220
you said there's not enough food so you

262
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,110
just have to do constant introductions

263
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:41,089
and this is all gonna depend on the

264
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:43,278
rates your pressure I mean and this is

265
00:10:41,089 --> 00:10:45,680
what I got to work with somebody that

266
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:49,039
can help you put these programs together

267
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:50,958
because as I'm working around North

268
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:52,099
America you know people's pressures are

269
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:55,250
different in different parts of the

270
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:59,240
country and you know if you're in a very

271
00:10:55,250 --> 00:11:01,429
cold climate and it's midwinter and you

272
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,839
know you get your spider mites abroad

273
00:11:01,429 --> 00:11:04,219
might cleaned up you might not have to

274
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:06,410
read you might not have to introduce

275
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:07,440
anything else for the rest of the step

276
00:11:06,409 --> 00:11:09,120
that until

277
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,500
you know it warms up outside if you're

278
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:15,659
in warmer climates and you know Vegas

279
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:17,370
Arizona Florida you know things like

280
00:11:15,659 --> 00:11:20,549
that you're gonna have constant

281
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:22,049
pressures coming in and so you know that

282
00:11:20,549 --> 00:11:25,378
you're more likely gonna have to stay on

283
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:27,299
a solid program okay and I guess my last

284
00:11:25,379 --> 00:11:30,240
question about broad nights would be

285
00:11:27,299 --> 00:11:33,659
what happens when you're in flower and

286
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,759
you notice that you have it are you are

287
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:36,958
you are you just screwed at that point

288
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:41,159
it sounds like because you're not

289
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:43,078
spraying Subway LX no you're not first

290
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:45,059
of all you should you know smack

291
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:47,370
yourself in the back your head for

292
00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:48,838
letting it get to that point because

293
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:50,850
they didn't just show up

294
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:54,240
they've been there for weeks and weeks

295
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:56,670
and weeks and weeks and this is why

296
00:11:54,240 --> 00:12:00,120
again I just you've got to be

297
00:11:56,669 --> 00:12:01,378
preventative about this stuff again the

298
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,328
ornamental and vegetable eyes have

299
00:12:01,379 --> 00:12:05,970
gotten it you know in propagation they

300
00:12:03,328 --> 00:12:08,370
just treat everything like they're going

301
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:11,459
to get problems you can't wait and I

302
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:15,209
mean you just can't get enough Keuka

303
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:18,688
Maris out or Swersky out in in flower on

304
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:20,188
to the plant because the application

305
00:12:18,688 --> 00:12:21,990
methods would just be very difficult you

306
00:12:20,188 --> 00:12:24,208
did it with so much carrier on the plant

307
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:30,409
the sachets will not release fast enough

308
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:30,409
for what you need it's just it's problem
