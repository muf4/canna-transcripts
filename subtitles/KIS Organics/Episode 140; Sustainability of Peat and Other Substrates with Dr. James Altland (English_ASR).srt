where we discuss The Cutting Edge of

6
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,719
growing from a science-based perspective

7
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:32,160
and drawn top experts from around the

8
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:33,920
IND to share their wisdom and knowledge

9
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,759
now before starting the podcast I want

10
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,960
to remind folks that we do have a

00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:40,599
patreon for Growers who want to access

12
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:42,840
to the unedited podcast weeks earlier as

13
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,920
well as extra content on our own grows

14

19
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,039
my guest this week is Dr James altland

20
00:00:55,479 --> 00:00:59,159
Dr altland is a research

21
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,518
horticulturalist and the research leader

22
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:03,599
for the US

23
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:06,400
ARS application technology Research Unit

24
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,519
also known as the atru although the role

25
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,359
of the atru has historically been to

26
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:12,560
develop new pesticide application

27
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:14,959
Technologies it has shifted its focus in

28
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,118
The Last 5 Years to developing CA

29
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:19,679
Technologies while leading a team of 10

30
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:22,239
scientists in various aspects of CA from

31
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,880
entomology Plant Pathology engineering

32
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:26,759
and horiculture Dr alin's expertise

33
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:28,599
encompasses the development of substrate

34
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:31,000
Technologies for containerized plant

35
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:32,919
production with collaborations at Ohio

36
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,719
State University this has recently

37
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,320
evolved into the microbial Community

38
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:40,200
analysis of container substrates now on

39
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:41,719
to the show hi James thank you so much

40
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,880
for coming on the show today I really

41
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:47,039
appreciate it yeah thank you for

42
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:50,158
inviting me Tad I'm I'm glad to be here

43
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:53,640
so I caught uh most of your presentation

44
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,799
that you did for the American Society of

45
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,718
Horticultural science talking about the

46
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:00,960
long-term sustainability of Pete in

47
00:01:57,718 --> 00:02:02,839
Horticulture and this is I think such an

48
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:04,519
important topic but can you tell us a

49
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:06,920
little bit about yourself and why you

50
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:10,159
were selected to be the speaker on this

51
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:12,598
uh particular topic yeah sure so I'm a

52
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:14,239
horiculture scientist for the US

53
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:16,560
Department of Agriculture what we call

54
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,080
the agricultural research service so

55
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,560
I've been working with soilless

56
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,080
substrates for about 20 years and a lot

57
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,159
of my research has been with uh Douglas

58
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:27,640
furar when I worked out at Oregon State

59
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:30,039
University pine bark here on the East

60
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:32,199
Coast um and I've heard all the

61
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:34,679
Rumblings about the use of Pete and the

62
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:38,199
sustainability of Pete and its impacts

63
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:40,080
on climate change Etc and um you know

64
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:41,719
Pete's an excellent substrate but you

65
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,440
know I I I didn't really pay much

66
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:46,158
attention to that it wasn't really what

67
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:50,400
I was focused on and then I attended a

68
00:02:46,158 --> 00:02:53,598
conference up in Quebec um last summer

69
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:56,599
um on Pete land restoration and what I

70
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:58,000
saw and what I experienced at that

71
00:02:56,598 --> 00:03:00,479
conference and now going out and

72
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,080
visiting some of the peeps did not mesh

73
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:06,079
well with what I'm hearing in the media

74
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:08,560
so what I wanted to do was to and and a

75
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,959
lot of what I hear in the media is is a

76
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:15,959
lot of um you know a lot of diet tribe a

77
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:17,039
lot of uh you know uh just um what's the

78
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:20,598
word I'm looking

79
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:23,039
for see this is why editing is good

80
00:03:20,598 --> 00:03:24,919
um I hear a lot of comments that aren't

81
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:27,079
substantiated by facts so what I want to

82
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:29,158
do was add some context some factual

83
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,920
basis for this conversation and let

84
00:03:29,158 --> 00:03:33,919
Growers and others make their own

85
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:35,759
informed decision about you know the

86
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:38,639
sustainability of Pete versus all the

87
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:39,878
other Alternatives that we might have um

88
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:42,518
in L of

89
00:03:39,878 --> 00:03:44,399
Pete yeah and I absolutely want to talk

90
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:46,080
about some of the the Alternatives that

91
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,438
you mentioned like the wood fibers the

92
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,920
Pine Bar Coco core obviously is a big

93
00:03:48,438 --> 00:03:52,239
one um but when we talk about substrates

94
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:54,958
you also have to include things like

95
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:58,640
perlite and rock wool which we know are

96
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:01,239
are not very sustainable um but yeah so

97
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:02,719
for me as someone who grew up in the

98
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:05,319
nursery industry and has been in the

99
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:07,759
horiculture industry uh pretty much my

100
00:04:05,318 --> 00:04:09,839
entire life um I've I've heard very

101
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:11,639
mixed things about Pete you talk to one

102
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,560
person and you hear that Pete is

103
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:16,000
destroying the world huge carbon

104
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,519
Footprints and it's quite damaging uh

105
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,120
and then you talk to other people you

106
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,439
know you know you talk to you read

107
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,240
what's on the premier promix website for

108
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:25,560
example and it'll say that Pete is quite

109
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,960
sustainable and it seems like there's

110
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,839
science on both sides and it's very

111
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:30,279
confusing for an average grower to

112
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:32,638
figure out what

113
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:35,198
if that if they want to be sustainable

114
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,680
and be um you know environmentally

115
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,680
conscious what our options are and in

116
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,439
your presentation right out at the

117
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,120
beginning you you share some headlines

118
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:45,839
from The New York Times saying why

119
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:48,038
gardeners should stop using Pete and

120
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:49,439
what they should use instead uh you have

121
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:51,639
one from Better Homes and Gardens

122
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:53,519
talking about how Pizza sore point in

123
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:55,319
the industry due to its lack of

124
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:57,319
sustainability and then National

125
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:59,719
Geographic uh one that we talked about

126
00:04:57,319 --> 00:05:01,399
before the show uh the headline to their

127
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:04,800
article is potting soil has a dirty

128
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:07,799
secret so there definitely is a media

129
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,960
push uh towards moving away from Peter

130
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,319
that Pete is is really harming our

131
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:15,758
environment um what what would you say

132
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:17,680
to all that well I don't have a dog in

133
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,280
this fight I don't get any money from

134
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,199
the Pete industry they don't pay me

135
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:22,559
anything I can't as a as a as an

136
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,919
employee for the federal government I

137
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,478
can't accept money from um outside

138
00:05:24,918 --> 00:05:29,478
interests like that so what I would like

139
00:05:27,478 --> 00:05:31,279
to I what I am trying to do with some of

140
00:05:29,478 --> 00:05:34,199
these presentations that I've done is

141
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:37,839
just share the facts and um I think when

142
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:41,919
you look objectively at the facts that

143
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:44,560
you come to the conclusion um that um

144
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:47,240
yes there is a price tag environmentally

145
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,038
for using peep but oftentimes the price

146
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,800
tag for using these Alternatives that

147
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:53,599
are touted are much higher and another

148
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:56,639
thing I like to do is to put into

149
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:59,160
context what how much what is the carbon

150
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,280
footprint of growing Media or Pete

151
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,800
specifically

152
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:04,638
relative to some other human activities

153
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,639
um and when you look at it from that

154
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,478
perspective you know and one thing I

155
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:11,759
tell people we're not using Pete or

156
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:13,719
other substrates to power private jets

157
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,560
and luxury yachs we're using this to

158
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:19,319
grow food we're using it to grow uh

159
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,720
Forest seedlings for reforestation and

160
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:24,520
we're using it to grow um plants for the

161
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:27,280
urban landscape which have um well

162
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:28,639
documented benefits on human wellness

163
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:30,399
and mental health and all sorts of

164
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,478
things so you can say well we don't need

165
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:35,000
patunas but you know the truth is even

166
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:37,680
ornamental plants have value to our

167
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,399
society and to human health so we're

168
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,639
using uh these soiless media for very

169
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:45,159
good reasons how can we do it in the

170
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,120
most sustainable way possible well we

171
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:49,520
can't do that we can't make those

172
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:52,120
decisions without facts so that's what

173
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:55,359
I'm trying to share with people is just

174
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:57,240
what does the data tell us in terms of

175
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,639
the sustainability of these various

176
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:02,199
growing media

177
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:04,598
well I want to get into the the data um

178
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:05,840
but I really think there's two things

179
00:07:04,598 --> 00:07:08,839
that we need to look at when we're

180
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:11,598
talking about substrates and the first

181
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:14,638
is uh first and foremost is

182
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:16,240
performance and so before we get into

183
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,240
like the sustainability of these

184
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,519
substrates in terms of performance where

185
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:24,319
does Pete rank on this on the scale of

186
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:27,680
Horticultural substrates Pete's the gold

187
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:29,520
standard and you know you can read I

188
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,199
could I could fill this room with

189
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:33,560
scientific studies com you know looking

190
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,079
for alternatives to Pete and there's a

191
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,319
reason why we don't have a good one yet

192
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:41,120
is because Pete generally outperforms

193
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:43,919
other substrates um the way that it is

194
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:46,759
processed um it is it's very uniform

195
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:49,639
it's very predictable um we've been

196
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:51,720
growing with this for over 60 years now

197
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:54,639
we' just gotten very good at engineering

198
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:57,479
the substrate um developing fertilizer

199
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:59,800
programs and irrigation programs so that

200
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:01,318
we can optimize the grow grow and

201
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:04,120
development of our crops now when you

202
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:06,000
change that to a different material um

203
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:08,959
often times it requires more fertilizer

204
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,038
more water more time um and and those

205
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:16,038
all cost uh carbon energy time dollars

206
00:08:12,038 --> 00:08:17,759
everything labor so um in terms of just

207
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:19,199
ranking the substrates Pete really is

208
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,319
the gold

209
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,280
standard yeah I just want to get that

210
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:27,000
out there for folks because I I think

211
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:28,878
that's really important I know um as

212
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,639
myself and my company search for other

213
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,479
alternative for Pete we keep we keep

214
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:35,200
falling short because ultimately we want

215
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:36,919
to create the best product you know for

216
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,360
growing plants and at the end of the day

217
00:08:36,918 --> 00:08:40,799
Pete really is that standard and one

218
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:45,159
other thing and this is probably a

219
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:47,399
little bit outside of your um your world

220
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:49,919
but in our in my industry by starting

221
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:51,720
with Pete Moss which is so acidic it

222
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:55,120
allows me to add more cats more

223
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:57,000
fertilizer essentially into that media

224
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,799
so that I can create a more fertile mix

225
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,120
than I could with cocoa core for example

226
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:03,000
because cocoe course starting with a

227
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:05,278
neutral pH um starts pushing us into

228
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,519
outside of range optimal pH ranges for

229
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:10,639
nutrient uptake so um with with Pete

230
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:12,399
Moss I can add biochar that's alkaline I

231
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:14,679
can add compost that's alkaline I can

232
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:17,399
add um a variety of different

233
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:19,078
fertilizers to reach a pH rain that's

234
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:21,360
still quite acceptable for nutrient

235
00:09:19,078 --> 00:09:23,319
uptake um so I just wanted to mention

236
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,800
that for the folks that are listening

237
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:27,640
because I know that a lot of people that

238
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:29,679
grow grow similarly to the way we do in

239
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:32,039
terms of creating a very fertile soil

240
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:34,000
mix um in this industry so I just want

241
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:35,639
to throw that out there yeah you know

242
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,919
you're absolutely right we're very good

243
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:41,720
at raising the pH of substrates you know

244
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:43,360
a small degree like Pete and pine bark

245
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:46,560
Falls in that same category generally

246
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,680
has a low PH we're very good at

247
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:50,838
elevating the pH to the right level when

248
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:52,958
you have to lower the ph because your

249
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:55,399
substrate starts out already too neutral

250
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:57,119
or basic that becomes very difficult we

251
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:59,679
can do it but then we run into a lot of

252
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,959
other problems so it's not nearly as

253
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:04,278
neat and clean as when you talk start

254
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:06,799
with a low PH substrate like PE you're

255
00:10:04,278 --> 00:10:10,360
exactly right great well let's let's

256
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:13,319
dive into the data then so um just from

257
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:15,120
looking over your your presentation here

258
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,519
um where where would you want to start

259
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,919
do you want to talk about the the Peete

260
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:21,679
boogs themselves or did you want to get

261
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:24,838
into some of the data around

262
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:27,359
um carbon sequestration and and that

263
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:28,920
sort of thing well I think I think it's

264
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,240
good to start with Peete bogs and what

265
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:33,519
is a Pete bog or a Pete land and why are

266
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:37,278
they so important and how does that

267
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:39,039
factor in to you know the uh global

268
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:41,480
climate change because that's really

269
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:43,199
what's driving this it's not that oh I I

270
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:45,320
want to substrate that works better than

271
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,600
Pete um you know there's a lot of

272
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,959
information out there a lot of

273
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:51,800
disinformation about you know how using

274
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:53,679
Pete affects climate change so that

275
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:55,519
might be a good place to start that if

276
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:58,599
if if you want to do

277
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:01,480
that yeah that that would be great I

278
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:03,639
didn't really know what a Peete Boog was

279
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:07,480
um and I think we should differentiate

280
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:09,560
between the United States and or I guess

281
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:13,200
North America would probably be better

282
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:14,958
and and Europe and Asia um what what

283
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,639
what is a peat Boog and what is the

284
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:20,879
condition of the Pete bogs across uh I

285
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:24,200
guess globally would be the question

286
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:27,078
yeah so Pete lands or Pete bogs are are

287
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:29,079
really it's a type of wetland um so if

288
00:11:27,078 --> 00:11:32,719
you think about Wetlands but Pete lands

289
00:11:29,078 --> 00:11:35,879
are special in that as plants die and

290
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:38,480
start to Decay that the the organic

291
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:40,879
matter accumulates faster than it breaks

292
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:44,399
down so you get a buildup of this

293
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:46,600
organic layer beneath um the the Wetland

294
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:49,559
or the Pete land and that it's it's a

295
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:52,839
it's a layer of Pete then um so that's

296
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:54,719
what characterizes a Pete land um now

297
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:58,920
one of the important characteristics of

298
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:02,200
a Pete land is that water will saturate

299
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:04,599
it up to about near the surface at the

300
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:07,800
surface or near the surface um as you

301
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:10,519
can imagine that type of land would not

302
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:12,679
be conducive to building roads or houses

303
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:14,198
or Farms or anything else so the first

304
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:16,239
thing you have to do when you use that

305
00:12:14,198 --> 00:12:19,399
land is you have to drain it so you

306
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:22,480
drain the water off of it and then that

307
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:25,919
Pete land becomes degraded now in the

308
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,720
history of you know Humanity um you can

309
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:31,039
look at the history of Europe they've

310
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:33,160
been using the Pete lands for farmland

311
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:35,360
and other reasons for a lot longer than

312
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:38,360
we have been in North America and what

313
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,879
that has resulted in is um over half of

314
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:43,879
the Pete lands in Europe are now

315
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:46,078
degraded um and a degraded Pete land

316
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:49,198
will tend to give off CO2 instead of

317
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:50,958
sequestering CO2 from the atmosphere the

318
00:12:49,198 --> 00:12:52,958
The Situation's a lot different in North

319
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:54,559
America where we've just had fewer

320
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:57,559
people and most of these Pete lands in

321
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:59,838
North America are in Canada at you know

322
00:12:57,559 --> 00:13:01,879
very high um latitude

323
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,199
so where there's not a lot of people

324
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:06,278
living to begin with so the Pete lands

325
00:13:04,198 --> 00:13:09,278
in North America are in just in much

326
00:13:06,278 --> 00:13:12,240
better health um and so that's one of

327
00:13:09,278 --> 00:13:14,600
the things that we discuss um but yeah

328
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,839
so a healthy functioning Pete land will

329
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:19,040
have water ader neared surface and it's

330
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:21,160
constantly sequestering CO2 from the

331
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:24,439
atmosphere that's what makes them so

332
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:25,838
valuable globally they're removing CO2

333
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:29,399
from the atmosphere instead of giving

334
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,399
CO2 off

335
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:37,639
so when I try to visually picture uh

336
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:39,240
Pete land um because Pete is primarily

337
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:41,560
just a bunch of organic matter that's

338
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:43,959
broken down and become this sort of

339
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:47,679
stable substrate that we know as Pete

340
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:50,319
Moss uh I would assume these lands are

341
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:51,799
quite rich with plant matter in order

342
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,399
for there to be plant matter to be

343
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:56,000
broken down to create the Pete is that

344
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,679
accurate like are there grasses and

345
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,240
shrubs and things like that on the land

346
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:03,000
or are they fairly barren

347
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:05,720
looking well the when you talk about

348
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,559
Pete lands there are two major types and

349
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:09,759
one is called a f you've probably heard

350
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:13,159
that word probably before just casually

351
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:14,879
but aen is kind of an early development

352
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:19,519
Pete land and they're dominated by

353
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:21,320
sedges and grasses um over time and as

354
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:23,519
as the characteristics of that Pete land

355
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:26,278
change and basically they start to swell

356
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:29,440
up above the water table they become a

357
00:14:26,278 --> 00:14:33,039
bog and a bog is typically dominated by

358
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:35,040
stagnum mosses so you'll see shrubs and

359
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:38,078
some other plants and even maybe some

360
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:41,759
trees growing in a Pete land or a Pete

361
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:44,599
bog but they're dominated by the sagna

362
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:48,000
Mosses which is where you know as those

363
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:50,680
mosses grow and then Decay beneath um

364
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,799
that's where we get this coveted sagum

365
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:56,679
Pete Moss from Canada so yeah that's

366
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:58,000
true um if I guess if you think uh and I

367
00:14:56,679 --> 00:15:01,120
have some pictures on here that you can

368
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:05,000
show Maybe um you know in in the in the

369
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:06,519
podcast but uh I I always Envision them

370
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,480
as being kind of like those images you

371
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:10,240
see of the tundra but there is a little

372
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,039
more variety of plant life when you

373
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,480
visit them in person especially the ones

374
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:16,759
that I visited in Ontario again more

375
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:20,000
shrubs more trees than you might expect

376
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:22,159
but they are dominating stagnum

377
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,159
mosses okay that makes that makes a lot

378
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:26,719
of sense to me um and that's great you

379
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:27,958
got to visit them so uh what were your

380
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,199
initial thoughts when you actually

381
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:33,318
visited and saw them in person

382
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:34,439
what what were the differences between

383
00:15:33,318 --> 00:15:36,360
what you had pictured in your head and

384
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:39,680
what you were actually

385
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:42,680
seeing well um I I guess one one of the

386
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:44,638
things that struck me we we visited a

387
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:46,559
what they would call Pristine bog never

388
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:50,120
been touch or never been altered in any

389
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:53,799
way and we visited a rehabilitated or

390
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:55,879
restored Pete bong post extraction so

391
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:58,120
they they extracted Pete from this for

392
00:15:55,879 --> 00:16:00,039
10 20 30 years I'm not sure how long and

393
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:01,959
then they restored it you couldn't tell

394
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:03,439
the difference my eyes couldn't tell the

395
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:05,518
difference and maybe a biologist would

396
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,160
come in and they you know see they're

397
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,399
looking for certain plant species or

398
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:11,399
something but you know to me visually

399
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:15,559
they looked very similar so I I was

400
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:17,360
really struck by that um the uh you know

401
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:19,719
it's really strange when you walk on

402
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:22,639
these peep bogs you know just

403
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:24,120
how I guess not a scientific term but

404
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:27,039
how squishy they are I mean you really

405
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:29,519
sink down in them so so uh they're

406
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:32,639
beautiful um they they're

407
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,959
uh it it's you can you know put your

408
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,440
hand down in there and pull up a big

409
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:37,958
clump of Pete it it's really um it's

410
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,279
fascinating to see everyone should do

411
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:42,919
that if they get the

412
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:45,000
opportunity uh but you know hearing

413
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:46,759
about the restoration efforts and the

414
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,399
success that they had in that that that

415
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:52,199
just didn't it's more of a conservation

416
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:53,759
practice is what I observe than what you

417
00:16:52,198 --> 00:16:56,039
know some of the media would have you

418
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:58,159
think they're strip mining Canada and

419
00:16:56,039 --> 00:17:00,039
it's just not the case the area that

420
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:02,000
they're harvesting P from is is

421
00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:05,000
incredibly small and then they're

422
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,919
restoring it afterwards anyhow so it's

423
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,318
just a different narrative than what you

424
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:11,480
see in the

425
00:17:09,318 --> 00:17:13,038
media yeah let's throw some numbers at

426
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:15,439
people here and I'm I'm looking at your

427
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:17,119
your slides here and so on the when you

428
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,600
talk about pristine Pete bogs you

429
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:23,399
mentioned that spag mosses grow slowly

430
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:25,639
about 20 to 120 millimeters per year and

431
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:28,000
Pete accumulates at about half to one

432
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:29,360
millimeter per year just to give people

433
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:34,400
some numbers there

434
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:39,399
um what what amount of Pete is actually

435
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:43,160
being uh harvested in North America

436
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:45,880
right now Rel relative to the the vast

437
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,919
size of these geographically of these of

438
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:50,679
Pete

439
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:53,000
lands so um and let me let me pull up

440
00:17:50,679 --> 00:17:56,159
those numbers so I don't say something

441
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,279
inaccurate here um and and while you're

442
00:17:56,159 --> 00:18:01,000
looking that up I'll add one more fact

443
00:17:58,279 --> 00:18:04,000
here uh from from your slide is that pet

444
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,200
lands cover about 3% of the earth's land

445
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,159
area which I thought was really

446
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,558
interesting I wasn't aware of that and

447
00:18:07,159 --> 00:18:11,600
it's a massive source of carbon

448
00:18:09,558 --> 00:18:14,240
sequestration which is why this is such

449
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:17,079
an important topic uh for people that

450
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,880
are concerned about the environment so

451
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:20,038
well let me talk let me get back to that

452
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,280
point because that's really interesting

453
00:18:20,038 --> 00:18:23,919
too because that gets to the heart of

454
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:27,038
the problem but to put this into

455
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:29,799
perspective every year during a good

456
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:33,599
year uh they will harvest of around 12

457
00:18:29,798 --> 00:18:36,359
million Cub meters of Pete to sell for

458
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:38,119
horiculture out of Canada now you can

459
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:40,479
estimate this several different ways but

460
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:43,879
what I've estimated that the Pete LS in

461
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:46,880
Canada are accumulating about 600

462
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:49,440
million cubic meters of Pete every year

463
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:52,320
so they're harvesting 12

464
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:55,080
and another 600 million cubic meters are

465
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:57,599
being generated that's because almost

466
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:59,558
all of the Pete land well over 80% of

467
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:01,639
the Pete lands in Canada are still in a

468
00:18:59,558 --> 00:19:06,119
pristine condition they're untouched

469
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:08,200
unfazed by human activities so although

470
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:11,279
they grow at a very small rate there's

471
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:14,880
such a massive land area that is growing

472
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:18,480
Pete um that it's it's it's accumulating

473
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:21,080
50 to 100 times faster than it's being

474
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:23,679
harvested uh for Horticultural purposes

475
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:25,918
in Canada so it it's it's growing at a

476
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,200
very rapid rate well I say let me take

477
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,600
that back it's not growing at a rapid

478
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,480
rate it's growing much more more than it

479
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:34,199
is being harvested the scale of it is so

480
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,679
massive that we're accumulating it

481
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,840
faster so that's that's really

482
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:41,480
fascinating to me because that is

483
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:43,038
something that you hear uh the opposite

484
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:46,159
a lot is that we're we're harvesting

485
00:19:43,038 --> 00:19:47,879
Pete way faster then uh it's

486
00:19:46,159 --> 00:19:50,320
accumulating and so we're

487
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:52,520
demolishing you know these beautiful

488
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:54,759
Canadian bogs

489
00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:56,119
um so that I think that's an important

490
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:58,400
point that I just want to highlight that

491
00:19:56,119 --> 00:20:00,639
you that you say there yeah and you know

492
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,280
like I said the the image they paint is

493
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,000
that we're strip mining Canada and

494
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:07,918
that's just not the case the area that's

495
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:12,119
being harvested is really small um and

496
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:15,038
now over the let's say they remove a a a

497
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:17,359
layer of about one meter okay over the

498
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:18,839
life of that bog it may take 10 or 15

499
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:21,240
years to do that but let's say they

500
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:23,720
remove a layer of one meter deep now

501
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:26,319
because it only brows about a half a

502
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:28,440
millimeter to a millimeter a year if you

503
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:30,879
wanted to replace that meter it would

504
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:33,200
take like a thousand years so that's the

505
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,559
argument often thrown out we're

506
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,519
harvesting Peete from these bogs and

507
00:20:35,558 --> 00:20:40,720
it's going to take centuries for it to

508
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:44,119
be replaced but the truth is once

509
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:47,360
they're done harvesting they will what

510
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:49,798
amounts to receding it with stagnum it's

511
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:52,678
a it's a fairly involved process and to

512
00:20:49,798 --> 00:20:55,200
to to restore those pee bogs but once

513
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:59,038
they're done those pee buls become

514
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:01,759
carbon accumulating carbon sequestering

515
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:05,119
fully functioning bogs again so they

516
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:07,960
start accumulating carbon in Pete almost

517
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:11,158
immediately within several years um it

518
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:13,079
can take three to maybe 10 or 15 years

519
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:15,919
depending on the you know rainfall and

520
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:18,720
things like that um

521
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:20,840
but well short of that 10,000-year

522
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,278
window that people like to convince you

523
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:25,278
that it it's going to take to rest they

524
00:21:23,278 --> 00:21:27,038
become functioning pee bogs again

525
00:21:25,278 --> 00:21:29,319
relatively

526
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:31,960
quickly okay that makes so essentially

527
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:33,879
what you're saying is this idea that um

528
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:36,400
once a bog has been harvested yes it

529
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:38,880
will take hundreds if not thousands of

530
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:41,559
years for that bog to get back to the

531
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,520
level of of Pete Moss that it had

532
00:21:41,558 --> 00:21:45,839
however it that during that time it's

533
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:48,240
still going to be sequestering carbon

534
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:51,839
and because it's such a small overall

535
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:54,759
percentage of Pete lands that we own

536
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:57,399
that we have um we're still growing more

537
00:21:54,759 --> 00:21:59,240
Pete than we're harvesting yeah

538
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:02,320
considerably more

539
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:05,240
massively more Pete in Canada is is

540
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:08,879
accumulating way faster than horiculture

541
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:11,400
is using it by by by again one to two

542
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:14,000
orders of magnitude faster okay and

543
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:16,000
let's let's touch on that so the the P

544
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,359
Moss spagna Pete Moss coming out of

545
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,200
Canada is primarily used uh 90% of it

546
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:23,798
according to your slide goes to the

547
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:26,640
United States and it's all used for

548
00:22:23,798 --> 00:22:28,599
horiculture um however this is not the

549
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:31,759
case in Europe so Europe is a very

550
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:33,798
different situation uh than uh North

551
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:36,519
America when it comes to the uses for

552
00:22:33,798 --> 00:22:38,278
Pete can you touch on that a little bit

553
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:40,519
yeah now one thing Europe does have in

554
00:22:38,278 --> 00:22:44,679
common all of the Pete harvested in

555
00:22:40,519 --> 00:22:46,278
Europe 96% of it stays in Europe so

556
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:50,720
that's one of the first things that Drew

557
00:22:46,278 --> 00:22:52,558
me to this discussion um Europe has a

558
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,798
much longer history than we have here in

559
00:22:52,558 --> 00:22:56,960
North America um and I can touch on that

560
00:22:54,798 --> 00:22:59,798
a little bit too in terms of population

561
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:02,319
but uh you know the Pete lands in Europe

562
00:22:59,798 --> 00:23:04,639
are in very bad condition the Pete lands

563
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:08,599
in North America are in relatively very

564
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:12,080
good condition so what we do in North

565
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:13,558
America for Growers I mean we're using

566
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:15,558
you know the Pete from Canada it should

567
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:18,119
be based on the conditions here in North

568
00:23:15,558 --> 00:23:19,599
America let Europe handle their problems

569
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:21,278
the the Pete we use in North America

570
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:23,359
comes from North America the Pete used

571
00:23:21,278 --> 00:23:27,038
in uh Europe comes from Europe but now

572
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:28,719
getting back to Europe um right now 62%

573
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:30,640
of the Peete that they harvest there is

574
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,600
used for energy that's something that

575
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,759
has never been done in North America

576
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:38,319
they have never used Canadian Pete to

577
00:23:34,759 --> 00:23:41,000
generate fuel or to you know heat homes

578
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:44,960
but most of it is used for that purpose

579
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:47,200
in Europe um 38% of the pee they call it

580
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:50,000
and this paper you know it's been cited

581
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,480
there um 38% is what they call

582
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,240
non-energy uses but that's all

583
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:55,079
horiculture when you read between the

584
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:58,200
lines all of that P so it's either

585
00:23:55,079 --> 00:24:00,000
energy or horiculture in Europe um but

586
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:02,558
that's not the case in North America

587
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,759
we're we're we're harvesting it just for

588
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:08,000
uh horiculture in in this

589
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:12,000
continent and I would assume combustion

590
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:14,759
of Pete has further carbon consequences

591
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,558
um would be my assumption when we look

592
00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:19,798
at the carbon footprint of Pete used

593
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:22,599
from horiculture we assume that all of

594
00:24:19,798 --> 00:24:26,359
it is mineralized or decomposed at some

595
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:27,639
point so and and and that's that's one

596
00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:30,240
important point when I give you the

597
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:32,320
numbers for the carbon footprint of Pete

598
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,839
that's assuming all of it's converted

599
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:37,918
into all that is harvested is converted

600
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:40,000
into CO2 so you would get the same

601
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:43,399
result by burning it

602
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,038
um you know so but even that said when

603
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:47,439
you look at the numbers for the carbon

604
00:24:45,038 --> 00:24:49,759
footprint and Pete is relatively small

605
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,919
compared to other human activities and

606
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:53,599
even other

607
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:55,919
substrates that's interesting because

608
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:59,398
when I think of Pete use in horiculture

609
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:02,120
I assume that there's an ological cost

610
00:24:59,398 --> 00:25:06,038
to the harvesting which there is but

611
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:09,119
then once I as a consumer receive that

612
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:10,798
plant or soil uh that plant that's

613
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:12,719
planted in in the Pete Moss that I'm

614
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:14,679
planting into my yard I see I look at it

615
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:19,079
more as a redistribution

616
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:22,360
of of Pete Moss into you know my local

617
00:25:19,079 --> 00:25:23,839
native soil or some other I mean I

618
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:25,879
realize there are people that are using

619
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:27,199
this media and then it's ending up in in

620
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:29,320
landfills and things which is

621
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:32,360
unfortunate but

622
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:35,558
um that to me has I guess a different

623
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:37,558
ecological or environmental impact than

624
00:25:35,558 --> 00:25:39,960
combustion I agree no you're you're

625
00:25:37,558 --> 00:25:42,519
right that's 100% correct however when

626
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:44,558
they calculate the carbon footprint you

627
00:25:42,519 --> 00:25:46,798
you may not see this but that Pete

628
00:25:44,558 --> 00:25:49,000
within a 100 years is going to decompose

629
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:52,359
probably completely in your yard if you

630
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,159
plant you know Alia in your garden the

631
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:56,240
Pete Moss is going to be gone within 100

632
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:57,919
years so they're assuming all that has

633
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,359
been converted to CO2 so when you look

634
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:03,919
at the carbon foot for peep that's a

635
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:05,558
worst case scenario and okay it's

636
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:07,080
probably as you said much better because

637
00:26:05,558 --> 00:26:08,798
you're using it to grow plants maybe

638
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:11,759
using to grow four seedlings that turn

639
00:26:08,798 --> 00:26:14,960
into 80 foot tall you know spruce trees

640
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:18,200
in on on the side of Mount Hood um who

641
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:20,038
knows but uh the the the the carbon

642
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:22,558
footprint the way they calculate it is a

643
00:26:20,038 --> 00:26:25,079
worst case scenario and most of it comes

644
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:28,918
from the actual carbon stored in the

645
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:30,599
peak okay so what what were your finding

646
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:33,759
in regards to the the studies and

647
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:37,240
research on Pete and other substrates

648
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:39,200
and their carbon uh impacts well one

649
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:41,960
thing I'd like to bring up first before

650
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:46,200
we get into that is just the the the

651
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:48,720
global climate situation um now what

652
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:51,278
really why this is such a concern to so

653
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,600
many people is that if you look on

654
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:55,599
planet Earth and this in and and in that

655
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:59,639
slide that I showed you this is on slide

656
00:26:55,599 --> 00:27:04,319
12 um right now there there are about

657
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:07,320
885 gigatons of CO2 stored in the

658
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:10,079
atmosphere and a gigaton is just simply

659
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:13,720
a billion metric tons so

660
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:16,759
885 billion metric tons of CO2 or CO2

661
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:20,640
equivalence in the atmosphere

662
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:26,519
um soils around the globe contain about

663
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:29,200
1,700 gigatons of that 550 to 600 gatons

664
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:32,000
are stored in Pete now the problem is

665
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:34,440
and the concern is what if we continue

666
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,159
to degrade pet Lance if we continue to

667
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:40,200
lose that carbon into the atmosphere

668
00:27:37,159 --> 00:27:43,679
what if even half or or a quarter of

669
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:46,319
that 550 to 600 gigatons is released

670
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:48,120
into the atmosphere to join the 885

671
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:51,759
gigatons already there well that would

672
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:56,239
be an ecological disaster so that is why

673
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:58,879
there's such a push to maintain the CO2

674
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:01,960
sequestering functions of heat lands

675
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:04,519
around the globe and that's the concern

676
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:07,240
now if you go to the next slide this

677
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:11,200
shows um

678
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:16,000
how the change in CO2 levels caused by

679
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:19,440
human activities um around the globe and

680
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:23,960
basically our biome Forest grasslands

681
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:27,120
Etc can absorb about 6.6 gigatons every

682
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:30,480
year the oceans absorb about 2.8

683
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:33,678
gigatons so planet Earth under natural

684
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:36,319
processes is absorbing around 9 or 10

685
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:39,278
gigatons of CO2 from the atmosphere

686
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:42,759
every year the problem is humans are

687
00:28:39,278 --> 00:28:44,679
giving off about 60 gigatons now 20

688
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:47,158
gigatons comes from energy production

689
00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:51,399
burning coal burning fossil fuels

690
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:54,760
whatever um 14 gigatons comes from

691
00:28:51,398 --> 00:28:57,319
industry there's this term called afolu

692
00:28:54,759 --> 00:28:58,879
or AOL I don't know how you would you

693
00:28:57,319 --> 00:29:02,158
know sound that out but it stands for

694
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:04,480
agriculture forestry and other land uses

695
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:08,559
that's given off 13 gigatons so that's

696
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:10,599
basically farming right um now in that

697
00:29:08,558 --> 00:29:12,918
number there's the Canadian Pete

698
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:15,599
industry that is responsible for

699
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:15,600
generating

700
00:29:16,119 --> 00:29:20,398
0.009 gigatons so when you look at the

701
00:29:19,398 --> 00:29:23,000
global

702
00:29:20,398 --> 00:29:25,918
scorecard it's a very small fraction

703
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:28,278
coming from peep but the concern is you

704
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:31,799
know maintaining the quality of heat

705
00:29:28,278 --> 00:29:34,440
lands around the globe but can we use

706
00:29:31,798 --> 00:29:38,359
heat from Canada for Horticultural

707
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:40,880
purposes and you know based on this data

708
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:44,000
the carbon footprint on an annual basis

709
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:48,039
of using Horticultural Pete is so small

710
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:51,119
it it it's not zero but it is very small

711
00:29:48,038 --> 00:29:51,119
relative to other human

712
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:56,360
activities yeah I'm looking at your

713
00:29:53,599 --> 00:30:00,240
slide you're saying like 8.7 gigatons of

714
00:29:56,359 --> 00:30:03,918
carbon or CO2 is released through

715
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:06,558
Transportation yeah and then yeah but

716
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:10,159
yet Canadian ped is

717
00:30:06,558 --> 00:30:12,079
0.009 gigaton so it's substantially l i

718
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:14,240
mean this is a pretty terrifying slide

719
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:15,759
when you think about it in terms of the

720
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,240
amount of sequestration we're having

721
00:30:15,759 --> 00:30:18,759
relative to the amount of

722
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:22,798
release

723
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:24,398
um but in in terms of Canadian Pete it's

724
00:30:22,798 --> 00:30:27,000
you're you're saying it's it's it's

725
00:30:24,398 --> 00:30:28,759
rather negligible or small negligible

726
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,839
relative the other activities and you

727
00:30:28,759 --> 00:30:34,158
know we should always strive for zero um

728
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:36,119
but again you know we're growing plants

729
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:38,640
we're using this Pete we're not burning

730
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:42,479
it for fuel we're not you know powering

731
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:46,080
luxury Yachts we're growing food we're

732
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:49,160
growing uh you know for seedlings and

733
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:50,359
we're growing plants so it's

734
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:53,480
[Music]

735
00:30:50,359 --> 00:30:55,798
um so it has further sequestration

736
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:58,120
properties as it adds to our overall

737
00:30:55,798 --> 00:31:00,839
quote unquote biome as it's used in this

738
00:30:58,119 --> 00:31:02,278
in this image um that's absolutely right

739
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:05,079
and one of the things I talk about at

740
00:31:02,278 --> 00:31:08,119
the end of my talk is that the only tool

741
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:09,720
we have right now the only reasonable

742
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:13,319
tool we have for

743
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:16,880
reversing CO2 levels in the atmosphere

744
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:18,839
is reforestation of land that is

745
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:21,480
currently not forested in the United

746
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:24,119
States and around the globe and the only

747
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:26,720
reasonable way to do that is to

748
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:30,439
drastically ramp up our reforestation

749
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:32,200
nurseries our for seedling nurseries and

750
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:34,240
now Studies by the four seedling

751
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:37,000
industry has said the best way to do

752
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:40,759
that is use container gr for

753
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,839
seedlings that use Pete so an irony of

754
00:31:40,759 --> 00:31:45,158
ironies Pete is the one material that

755
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:48,000
may help us get out of this

756
00:31:45,159 --> 00:31:52,320
mess that is

757
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:55,558
interesting so uh before we move on can

758
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:58,720
you just touch on Europe again because

759
00:31:55,558 --> 00:32:01,678
you mentioned that um you know a lot of

760
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:03,639
it's used for energy that it has they

761
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:06,038
have all these issues is there I mean in

762
00:32:03,638 --> 00:32:08,918
your opinion is there a solution for

763
00:32:06,038 --> 00:32:11,278
folks in Europe in terms of uh other

764
00:32:08,919 --> 00:32:13,559
options or is the conversation around

765
00:32:11,278 --> 00:32:16,319
Pete quite different like if you lived

766
00:32:13,558 --> 00:32:18,398
in London would you use Pete Moss versus

767
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:21,079
if you lived in North

768
00:32:18,398 --> 00:32:23,319
America well I believe in Europe there

769
00:32:21,079 --> 00:32:26,278
is much greater scrutiny now they've

770
00:32:23,319 --> 00:32:29,079
banned all Harvest of Pete from Ireland

771
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:31,679
so I you know they had to shut down Pete

772
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:33,960
harvesting completely and and now what

773
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:35,440
has happened though is they're just

774
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:38,880
getting their Pete from somewhere else

775
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:40,399
like laia or Estonia so they haden't

776
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,519
stopped the use of Pete they just

777
00:32:40,398 --> 00:32:45,239
shifted where it comes from so Ireland's

778
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:48,359
taking care of Ireland but they're still

779
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:51,480
using Pete I guess is that now they have

780
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:53,918
been um very proactive in using wood

781
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:56,880
fibers and other alternative growing

782
00:32:53,919 --> 00:33:02,360
media but again comes with its own set

783
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:04,320
of problems so um you know and when I

784
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:06,719
talked to some of my European colleagues

785
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:09,119
what is actually legislated what is

786
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,679
proposed what is actually being done in

787
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:12,879
Europe it's it's a real mixed bag and

788
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:16,639
it's really hard to be you know give a

789
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:19,080
concise overview but um there is more

790
00:33:16,638 --> 00:33:21,240
pressure for environmental legislation

791
00:33:19,079 --> 00:33:24,359
there there is more pressure against

792
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:26,000
using it just socially so I think they

793
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:28,439
want to phase it out completely from

794
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:32,159
England by the year 2030

795
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:33,880
um so but keeping track of what is

796
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:35,760
proposed versus what is actually done

797
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:37,639
has been somewhat challenging you know

798
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:39,919
from this side of the

799
00:33:37,638 --> 00:33:42,439
pond well this might be a good time to

800
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:46,200
transition into other substrates and how

801
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:48,759
they compare so um one of the things

802
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:50,120
that you did in your presentation was

803
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:52,879
you look you know we've been talking

804
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:55,239
about sort of the environmental impacts

805
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:57,960
of Pete Moss as a substrate but if we

806
00:33:55,240 --> 00:34:01,240
want to make a determination a true Det

807
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:03,720
mination about a substrate uh we need to

808
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:06,798
also look at its uh social and human

809
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:09,440
health impacts as well um that's correct

810
00:34:06,798 --> 00:34:11,000
yeah which I think is a really important

811
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,599
aspect especially when we start talking

812
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:17,280
about things that are being transported

813
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:19,639
over large distances to get to us so um

814
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:22,480
yeah let's dive into it so can we kind

815
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:24,559
of cover Pete Moss first from sort of

816
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:27,320
this uh I think you call it a life cycle

817
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:29,078
analysis in terms of um human health

818
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,280
effects social effects environmental and

819
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:34,399
then we can do the same with some of

820
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:35,800
these other substrates yeah so um now

821
00:34:34,398 --> 00:34:37,440
some of your listeners probably have

822
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:39,359
heard about this before but there are

823
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,358
there's there's a there's a process

824
00:34:39,358 --> 00:34:44,319
called a life cycle analysis or life

825
00:34:41,358 --> 00:34:49,279
cycle assessment where they try to

826
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:53,480
quantitatively measure the impacts of um

827
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:56,119
any service any process or any product

828
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:58,719
on um you know the environment human

829
00:34:56,119 --> 00:35:00,559
health society and and you know they're

830
00:34:58,719 --> 00:35:03,439
they're constantly expanding what they

831
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:06,000
can measure the impact on um but the the

832
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:08,119
goal of these is to do a fair and

833
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,480
objective quantitative analysis to

834
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:13,680
determine how these um uh how these

835
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:16,320
products you know impact you know again

836
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:19,559
society and and and the environment so

837
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:21,480
when we look at Pete um we can measure

838
00:35:19,559 --> 00:35:24,000
the the the the the big one is the

839
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:27,280
carbon footprint how many kilograms of

840
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,679
CO2 per cubic meter of pee is released

841
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:32,079
in the atmosphere um when you harvest

842
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:34,519
that Pete and use it for horiculture so

843
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:38,560
they've done that and those values range

844
00:35:34,519 --> 00:35:42,880
from 20 to 150 kilograms of CO2

845
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:45,078
equivalent per cubic meter um now what

846
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:47,160
what is you know you can look at

847
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:48,640
different studies each study makes a

848
00:35:47,159 --> 00:35:51,159
different set of assumptions where was

849
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:53,960
that Peete harvested how far was it

850
00:35:51,159 --> 00:35:55,598
transported and then how was it used So

851
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:57,800
based on those assumptions they will

852
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:59,920
come up with slightly different values

853
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:02,720
but generally speaking most of the

854
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:05,559
values range from about 20 to 50

855
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:08,118
kilograms of CO2 per cubic meter one of

856
00:36:05,559 --> 00:36:12,039
them was as high as 150 um so there's

857
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:14,760
some variability there but um now as we

858
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:17,279
discussed before we we got on here a lot

859
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:19,560
of this data comes from Europe so we

860
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:22,640
only have one study to my knowledge that

861
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:25,000
was done in North America and I think

862
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:28,358
they ter determined that the the carbon

863
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:33,119
footprint was about 50 um kilg per cubic

864
00:36:28,358 --> 00:36:35,880
meter so um now you compare that to core

865
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:38,599
just in terms of its CO2 equivalence or

866
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:40,800
or its carbon footprint in most studies

867
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:43,680
but not all in most studies core has a

868
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:46,560
slightly lower carbon footprint than

869
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:49,078
does Pete but now the carbon Footprints

870
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:51,358
only one part of the story you can look

871
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:54,640
at the environmental impact that also

872
00:36:51,358 --> 00:36:57,838
considers things like um terrestrial

873
00:36:54,639 --> 00:37:01,838
acidification fresh and Marine water you

874
00:36:57,838 --> 00:37:05,000
rication uh ecotoxicity land use fossil

875
00:37:01,838 --> 00:37:07,759
resource scarcity and water consumption

876
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:10,800
when you factor all those in core

877
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:13,760
becomes it has a higher relative impact

878
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:16,119
than Pete usually much worse and a lot

879
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:18,280
of that has to do with how core is

880
00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:21,200
processed it uses a tremendous amount of

881
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:23,480
water um and it also releases a high

882
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:26,799
salt load into the environment wherever

883
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:30,920
it's done in order to you know flush the

884
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:32,960
salts from the core piip so um yeah when

885
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:35,760
you look at the the total environmental

886
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:37,960
impact generally Pete has a much lower

887
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:40,560
impact than does core or other products

888
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:42,720
like rock wool and

889
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:44,400
perlite yeah when I first started

890
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:46,719
looking into this I was trying to put

891
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,200
together an article comparing uh Heat

892
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:50,559
versus Coco because it was something

893
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:53,279
that I was interested in and one of the

894
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:54,799
things that I found was with cocoa core

895
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:57,680
like you mentioned there's a there's a

896
00:37:54,800 --> 00:38:00,200
huge water consumption and water is

897
00:37:57,679 --> 00:38:02,639
premium um these days clean water is

898
00:38:00,199 --> 00:38:04,199
something that we struggle with globally

899
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:05,719
uh so we're using a lot of water to

900
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:07,919
flush all the salinity like you

901
00:38:05,719 --> 00:38:11,159
mentioned that salt has to go somewhere

902
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:12,920
um and then that clean Core has to be uh

903
00:38:11,159 --> 00:38:15,559
dried and compressed and shipped all the

904
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:18,599
way over here to North America because

905
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:21,759
it's being harvested um in in tropical

906
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:23,240
areas and then uh the other thing that

907
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:25,440
surprised me too that we haven't talked

908
00:38:23,239 --> 00:38:28,719
about and that falls under sort of the

909
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:31,318
social human health aspect is is the

910
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:35,159
respiratory effects that this was having

911
00:38:31,318 --> 00:38:37,000
it may have been generating um economic

912
00:38:35,159 --> 00:38:38,879
wealth for a particular Community but it

913
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,719
was causing huge respiratory problems

914
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,000
for the workers that were collecting the

915
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:44,000
core and I don't know if that has

916
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:48,000
changed since I first looked into this

917
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:49,318
15 or so years ago but um that was

918
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,119
something that I I thought was a

919
00:38:49,318 --> 00:38:53,639
considerable point to consider when

920
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:55,318
making a substrate decision too yeah

921
00:38:53,639 --> 00:38:58,199
that you're absolutely right now all the

922
00:38:55,318 --> 00:39:00,519
core today most of it comes from Sri

923
00:38:58,199 --> 00:39:03,239
Lanka or India although they are trying

924
00:39:00,519 --> 00:39:05,920
to develop some um products from South

925
00:39:03,239 --> 00:39:07,399
America as well now you know harvesting

926
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,720
from South America so we'll see how that

927
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:11,680
goes but you're right you know they can

928
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:14,000
also measure human health impact that

929
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:17,078
incur it includes things like toxic

930
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:20,199
effects carcinogens respiratory effects

931
00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:22,440
that you mentioned ionizing radiation

932
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:24,679
fine particulate matter in Ozone

933
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:27,639
depletion and when you factor those

934
00:39:24,679 --> 00:39:31,118
things in again in every study that we

935
00:39:27,639 --> 00:39:34,440
have data for both Pete and core core

936
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:38,280
has a higher human health impact than

937
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:39,639
does Pete um and and rock wool in one

938
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:42,240
case rockwool was actually lower than

939
00:39:39,639 --> 00:39:45,118
core but rockwool was also pretty high

940
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:47,078
um so yeah you're right now one thing I

941
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:49,599
will say is that I I believe there's

942
00:39:47,079 --> 00:39:52,039
been a lot of investment in the core in

943
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:53,760
the last 10 years so some large

944
00:39:52,039 --> 00:39:56,400
companies from North America are

945
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:59,720
investing in that and I think they are

946
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:01,680
um so so you know you're right when we

947
00:39:59,719 --> 00:40:04,279
first started using core there was lots

948
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:06,159
of concerns about worker safety worker

949
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:08,079
conditions and in some of these

950
00:40:06,159 --> 00:40:10,598
developing countries but I think a lot

951
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:12,400
of that has changed and I think you know

952
00:40:10,599 --> 00:40:15,119
um corporate investment and those sorts

953
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:16,318
of things has improve that situation

954
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:17,838
although I don't have firsthand

955
00:40:16,318 --> 00:40:20,519
knowledge of it that's just what I

956
00:40:17,838 --> 00:40:21,960
suspect um but still I mean these

957
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:23,759
studies were done in the last two or

958
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:28,280
three years the human health impact of

959
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:30,319
core is still greater than what Pete is

960
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:31,800
and along with this I just would like to

961
00:40:30,318 --> 00:40:33,920
add that I'm making personally the

962
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:38,519
assumption that rock wall and perlite

963
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:40,200
are worse substrates than um Peter Coco

964
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:43,119
so I'm kind of ranking them in terms of

965
00:40:40,199 --> 00:40:45,759
environmental impact as uh from lowest

966
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:48,640
to highest going sort of Pete

967
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:51,440
Coco and then I would assume perlite

968
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:53,480
then rock wall um as the major

969
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,960
substrates you know rock wool is

970
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:57,318
something that's used of course by

971
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:59,280
hydroponic Growers and that's kind of

972
00:40:57,318 --> 00:41:01,960
almost a whole different category you

973
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:03,519
either use it completely or not at all

974
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:05,480
but per light's something that we've

975
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:08,759
always traditionally mixed in with our

976
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:10,800
substrates especially Peete um and I

977
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:14,160
think everyone in the industry from

978
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:15,720
grower up to substrate providers

979
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:18,239
manufacturers

980
00:41:15,719 --> 00:41:19,879
everyone you know that that's that's the

981
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:22,239
first thing that people are looking to

982
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:25,880
replace that's kind of you know people

983
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:28,959
are looking to get away from perlite and

984
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:31,559
now I get a nasty email from the perlite

985
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:34,400
manufacturers every time I say that but

986
00:41:31,559 --> 00:41:38,000
that that's just you know the reality

987
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:40,960
um yeah that's a tough one because

988
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:45,199
um I mean perlite works so well now we

989
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:48,679
use pmus and our soil mixes because um

990
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:51,118
it it's it's heavier which is great from

991
00:41:48,679 --> 00:41:52,838
uh a substrate perspective but in terms

992
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:54,358
of shipping and and those sorts of

993
00:41:52,838 --> 00:41:58,480
things and fossil fuel cost it's it's

994
00:41:54,358 --> 00:42:00,598
definitely higher to move pmus around um

995
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:03,199
one of the things that's so awful about

996
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:06,400
the Cannabis industry which I'm a a part

997
00:42:03,199 --> 00:42:08,159
of um is that uh a lot of people are

998
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,639
throwing out this media so whether you

999
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:12,279
know at least with Rockwell people are

1000
00:42:09,639 --> 00:42:14,920
now starting to reuse it and things but

1001
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:18,000
um the amount of of perlite the amount

1002
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:21,159
of cocoa core and Pete Moss that gets uh

1003
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:23,880
put into landfalls or dumped out every

1004
00:42:21,159 --> 00:42:25,960
round is is really quite quite a

1005
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:27,760
contributor I think to environmental

1006
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:29,720
damage um

1007
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:31,200
one of the things and you you don't know

1008
00:42:29,719 --> 00:42:32,639
me you know we haven't talked about this

1009
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:36,118
one of the things that my company does

1010
00:42:32,639 --> 00:42:38,279
is we work with folks um in creating uh

1011
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:40,519
like for example taking the Cannabis

1012
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:43,440
putting it into a soil bed like let's

1013
00:42:40,519 --> 00:42:45,920
just say a 4x4 bed of soil and then at

1014
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:47,760
the end of the cycle uh we will soil

1015
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:49,519
test and reuse that media so we're just

1016
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:50,559
adding you know nutrients back into it

1017
00:42:49,519 --> 00:42:52,880
treating it sort of more like

1018
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:55,079
agricultural land so while we do have

1019
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:57,480
the environmental impact of of starting

1020
00:42:55,079 --> 00:42:59,440
with Pete Moss we're not adding more

1021
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:00,960
media every cycle we're reusing that

1022
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,960
substrate over and over again and we

1023
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,960
have people that have been doing this

1024
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:08,000
for you know 5 to 10 years now with the

1025
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:10,760
same uh the same media and so that to me

1026
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,960
feels better at least in when I'm using

1027
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:13,680
Pete at least I feel like I'm I'm

1028
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:15,800
creating a highest use case for it from

1029
00:43:13,679 --> 00:43:17,759
a Horticultural perspective to where I'm

1030
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:21,039
having less environmental impact once

1031
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:23,599
that soil is sort of created it in place

1032
00:43:21,039 --> 00:43:25,960
yeah that's right yeah um and there are

1033
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:27,880
lots of creative ways that you can reuse

1034
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:30,400
Pete and you know I think think it's

1035
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:32,559
it's an especially post production it's

1036
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:34,559
an excellent soil amendment if you have

1037
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:37,800
that Outlet nearby where you can apply

1038
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:41,319
it to agricultural land um you know it

1039
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:45,720
whereas I know using some of the mineral

1040
00:43:41,318 --> 00:43:48,318
products like uh rock wool or perlite um

1041
00:43:45,719 --> 00:43:51,558
disposal is a problem it's a challenge

1042
00:43:48,318 --> 00:43:53,239
um uh now you know you mentioned pmus I

1043
00:43:51,559 --> 00:43:55,319
I was a a professor at Oregon State

1044
00:43:53,239 --> 00:43:57,159
University for a while so yeah we we

1045
00:43:55,318 --> 00:43:58,639
work with pus a lot that that's an

1046
00:43:57,159 --> 00:44:00,719
interesting material to work with and

1047
00:43:58,639 --> 00:44:02,558
it's a very good substrate and um can

1048
00:44:00,719 --> 00:44:04,199
you share a little bit about pmus since

1049
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:06,519
it sounds like you have some experience

1050
00:44:04,199 --> 00:44:09,960
with it in comparison to perlite and

1051
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:12,960
other options you know I I guess in the

1052
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:14,920
Oregon Nursery industry it was used now

1053
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:17,159
this is outdoor Nursery crops Woody

1054
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:20,119
plants you know container nurseries it

1055
00:44:17,159 --> 00:44:21,399
was used almost exclusively relative to

1056
00:44:20,119 --> 00:44:23,519
perlight we didn't use pearlite and

1057
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:26,200
Nursery crops we use Douglas furb bark

1058
00:44:23,519 --> 00:44:28,119
and pmus and so I went and visited there

1059
00:44:26,199 --> 00:44:30,799
were at the time there were two sources

1060
00:44:28,119 --> 00:44:33,480
of pmus in Oregon um one from the bend

1061
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:37,000
area and one down south southern Oregon

1062
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:39,519
I forget the exact region um but just

1063
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,639
visiting those you know those pmus area

1064
00:44:39,519 --> 00:44:44,318
the pmus mines and seeing how they they

1065
00:44:41,639 --> 00:44:45,480
mine it from the ground um and then

1066
00:44:44,318 --> 00:44:47,318
looking at some of the chemical and

1067
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:50,000
physical characteristics of the pmus and

1068
00:44:47,318 --> 00:44:51,639
how it's used in in in Nursery crops

1069
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,239
that and I've wrote some articles years

1070
00:44:51,639 --> 00:44:55,719
and years and years ago I don't remember

1071
00:44:53,239 --> 00:44:58,399
the details anymore but um and we' use

1072
00:44:55,719 --> 00:45:01,679
it like 10 to 20% of the growing of the

1073
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:04,519
container mix so it was relatively minor

1074
00:45:01,679 --> 00:45:06,039
uh component in the substrate but um

1075
00:45:04,519 --> 00:45:07,679
yeah it was interesting looking at it

1076
00:45:06,039 --> 00:45:09,400
especially visiting the mines and seeing

1077
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:11,358
how it's extracted and and you know

1078
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:13,358
processed and that sort of

1079
00:45:11,358 --> 00:45:15,279
thing and what are the differences

1080
00:45:13,358 --> 00:45:16,279
between uh prite and pmus for people

1081
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:18,960
that are

1082
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:21,200
unfamiliar well I would say the primary

1083
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:24,679
difference you mentioned is the weight

1084
00:45:21,199 --> 00:45:27,078
the the the the pomus is just heavier

1085
00:45:24,679 --> 00:45:28,639
and and almost if you're not to the

1086
00:45:27,079 --> 00:45:31,318
untrained eye it might even look the

1087
00:45:28,639 --> 00:45:36,000
same feel the same it's um you know it's

1088
00:45:31,318 --> 00:45:39,558
a porous uh volcanic material and um the

1089
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,440
the the pomus out of Bend was very white

1090
00:45:39,559 --> 00:45:43,920
and so you might almost be tricked into

1091
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:46,599
thinking it was perlite the pomus out of

1092
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:49,318
Southern Oregon had a it was stained it

1093
00:45:46,599 --> 00:45:52,559
was the the ribbon of pomus they were

1094
00:45:49,318 --> 00:45:55,480
mining was closer to the soil surface so

1095
00:45:52,559 --> 00:45:57,760
it was stained a little more yellow and

1096
00:45:55,480 --> 00:46:00,358
it didn't look as bright gleaming white

1097
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:02,200
as the the bend pmus did um but other

1098
00:46:00,358 --> 00:46:04,358
than that as far as growing media other

1099
00:46:02,199 --> 00:46:06,279
than it increased the bulk density of

1100
00:46:04,358 --> 00:46:09,318
your media a little more relative to

1101
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:10,960
what per you you really didn't measure

1102
00:46:09,318 --> 00:46:13,079
anything there was no measurable

1103
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:15,358
difference in chemical properties or or

1104
00:46:13,079 --> 00:46:17,800
otherwise at least from what we've done

1105
00:46:15,358 --> 00:46:20,159
it was just you know about the same

1106
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:21,960
particle size now the the products that

1107
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:23,879
we using Nur Nursery industry were a

1108
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:26,119
little dustier um they had a lot of

1109
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:28,000
fines in them you know the pus product

1110
00:46:26,119 --> 00:46:30,318
unless you had a double screen but

1111
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:33,039
otherwise it was very similar to

1112
00:46:30,318 --> 00:46:35,880
perlite yeah we had to move to using uh

1113
00:46:33,039 --> 00:46:38,279
2/3 medium oneir large pmus for that

1114
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:40,079
reason when we use just medium pmus the

1115
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:42,079
amount of finds in there actually

1116
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:45,039
created less Iration end up being this

1117
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:48,318
sort of goopy mess so that is that is a

1118
00:46:45,039 --> 00:46:50,239
good point um one thing as I think about

1119
00:46:48,318 --> 00:46:53,679
other things that we can add to Media

1120
00:46:50,239 --> 00:46:57,479
for IRAs and I want to transition into

1121
00:46:53,679 --> 00:47:00,039
uh pine bark next but um

1122
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:02,358
as I look for other options for ariation

1123
00:47:00,039 --> 00:47:05,719
in in my industry people will use rice

1124
00:47:02,358 --> 00:47:08,358
holes as a form of ariation but that has

1125
00:47:05,719 --> 00:47:11,919
sustainability issues and it also is uh

1126
00:47:08,358 --> 00:47:14,400
potentially a a source of arsenic which

1127
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:17,079
um because Canabis is being tested now

1128
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:19,480
for heavy metal content at very very

1129
00:47:17,079 --> 00:47:21,280
strict levels in some regulated States

1130
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:24,318
um that can be a huge contributor and a

1131
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:26,359
big problem um that also makes it hard

1132
00:47:24,318 --> 00:47:28,480
to use things like lava volcanic lava

1133
00:47:26,358 --> 00:47:29,838
rock because as that breaks down if

1134
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:31,800
you're reusing your media that also

1135
00:47:29,838 --> 00:47:35,000
could be adding heavy metals whereas the

1136
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:37,960
pmus um that we've seen is is pretty

1137
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,559
clean relative minerally it doesn't it

1138
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:41,960
doesn't really have a lot of uh heavy

1139
00:47:39,559 --> 00:47:43,839
metals so uh I just wanted to mention

1140
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:46,358
that as a sort of an aside

1141
00:47:43,838 --> 00:47:49,318
around you know airation options there

1142
00:47:46,358 --> 00:47:53,000
really I haven't found a better one but

1143
00:47:49,318 --> 00:47:55,519
maybe um maybe exploration of of pine

1144
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:58,318
bark or or some of these other wood

1145
00:47:55,519 --> 00:47:59,880
substrates um is a possibility I mean

1146
00:47:58,318 --> 00:48:04,800
what are your thoughts on

1147
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:07,039
them yeah so one one thing is that um I

1148
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:11,039
did research with biochars about 10 or

1149
00:48:07,039 --> 00:48:13,039
15 years ago and problem was at the time

1150
00:48:11,039 --> 00:48:15,000
it was an interesting product to work

1151
00:48:13,039 --> 00:48:18,759
with but there was no there was no

1152
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:20,559
Source no large volume source of it and

1153
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:23,240
as much as people talked about it and

1154
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:24,880
how exciting biochar was you know you

1155
00:48:23,239 --> 00:48:26,598
really couldn't find it for a reasonable

1156
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:28,480
price well that's changed now I don't

1157
00:48:26,599 --> 00:48:31,519
know what has changed in the energy

1158
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:35,039
sector but now there are more sources

1159
00:48:31,519 --> 00:48:38,079
abundant sources of biochar commercially

1160
00:48:35,039 --> 00:48:40,318
so that's something that um I know one

1161
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:42,920
of the major substrate manufacturers now

1162
00:48:40,318 --> 00:48:45,239
are using biochar instead of perlite as

1163
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:47,000
the kind of the coar quote unquote

1164
00:48:45,239 --> 00:48:51,078
aggregate that you put in the media to

1165
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:53,440
provide drainage and so um presumably

1166
00:48:51,079 --> 00:48:56,880
biochar would be very stable for very

1167
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:58,798
long periods of time and um you know not

1168
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:00,599
have some of the you know the the heavy

1169
00:48:58,798 --> 00:49:03,400
metal toxicities that you might find

1170
00:49:00,599 --> 00:49:07,280
with other you know mineral sources from

1171
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:08,639
the ground um wood fibers are something

1172
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:11,920
you know I think we discussed this a

1173
00:49:08,639 --> 00:49:13,558
little bit before we got on the air um

1174
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:16,318
that's something that started in Europe

1175
00:49:13,559 --> 00:49:18,519
and now you can find an abundant supply

1176
00:49:16,318 --> 00:49:20,318
of that in North America as well there's

1177
00:49:18,519 --> 00:49:21,679
there's at least one major manufacturer

1178
00:49:20,318 --> 00:49:25,400
and there may be two or three coming

1179
00:49:21,679 --> 00:49:29,480
online soon but um literally taking the

1180
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:31,680
wood portion of pine trees and um and

1181
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:33,280
I'm not sure the mechanical process they

1182
00:49:31,679 --> 00:49:36,000
put it through it's some sort of dis

1183
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:38,400
extrus Extrusion I think but it creates

1184
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,719
a fiber it's almost like you know a

1185
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:42,680
wooden Brill pad is what it feels like

1186
00:49:40,719 --> 00:49:45,919
very difficult to mix and very difficult

1187
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:47,519
to work with from a mixing standpoint um

1188
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:49,559
you need specialized equipment to do

1189
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:52,880
that but if you have that equipment and

1190
00:49:49,559 --> 00:49:55,240
you can mix it uh it it does create a a

1191
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:57,280
fairly good substrate you can replace up

1192
00:49:55,239 --> 00:49:59,039
to 30 to 40% of the

1193
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:01,280
or maybe use that as the Iration

1194
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:03,239
component of your

1195
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:04,359
media yeah I want to back up for a

1196
00:50:03,239 --> 00:50:06,118
second I'm really glad you brought a

1197
00:50:04,358 --> 00:50:08,199
biochar it's something that I sort of

1198
00:50:06,119 --> 00:50:09,519
take for granted uh because it's

1199
00:50:08,199 --> 00:50:12,439
something we've been using for a long

1200
00:50:09,519 --> 00:50:14,199
time and I I I've done podcasts just on

1201
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:15,920
biochar because it I think it's so

1202
00:50:14,199 --> 00:50:18,039
fascinating but yes that is another

1203
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:21,318
great option I haven't experimented with

1204
00:50:18,039 --> 00:50:24,318
using it as more than eight% of my uh

1205
00:50:21,318 --> 00:50:27,000
total media primarily because of cost

1206
00:50:24,318 --> 00:50:29,358
and again when we talk about biochar uh

1207
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:31,039
it's like compost I just for listeners

1208
00:50:29,358 --> 00:50:33,159
keep in mind they're not all created

1209
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:35,358
equal um particle size is going to have

1210
00:50:33,159 --> 00:50:37,920
a big impact in terms of the gas

1211
00:50:35,358 --> 00:50:40,480
exchange moisture retention irration

1212
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:43,039
effects of biochar so uh don't just go

1213
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:44,280
out and buy a bag biochar and think that

1214
00:50:43,039 --> 00:50:45,558
you're going to get these results you

1215
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:49,400
need to do a little little bit more

1216
00:50:45,559 --> 00:50:51,119
research into it but um yeah I think I

1217
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:54,720
think biochar would be a great solution

1218
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:56,640
it's still I think the the I they still

1219
00:50:54,719 --> 00:51:00,039
find it prohibitively expensive to get

1220
00:50:56,639 --> 00:51:02,879
quality biochar in a media at a high

1221
00:51:00,039 --> 00:51:05,239
percentage but um you know for a home

1222
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:07,358
grower that might be quite reasonable to

1223
00:51:05,239 --> 00:51:10,199
consider experimenting with at higher

1224
00:51:07,358 --> 00:51:12,759
ratios than the eight% that we go

1225
00:51:10,199 --> 00:51:14,598
with yeah and what we have been working

1226
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:18,000
with is more of like a

1227
00:51:14,599 --> 00:51:21,960
15% um on a volumetric basis so we're

1228
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:24,318
probably closer to you in that regard um

1229
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:26,400
uh yeah and and and again as a scientist

1230
00:51:24,318 --> 00:51:28,480
I one of the last things I think about

1231
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:29,960
sometimes times is the price which maybe

1232
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:31,000
I should think about that more often

1233
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:34,119
because that's what the grower

1234
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:35,960
ultimately is going to be looking at um

1235
00:51:34,119 --> 00:51:37,519
so I'm not sure what the cost on the

1236
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:41,318
material we've been working with has

1237
00:51:37,519 --> 00:51:43,759
been but it's a wood-based biochar uh

1238
00:51:41,318 --> 00:51:45,838
you know as when I work with these

1239
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:48,240
companies that do the pyrolysis that

1240
00:51:45,838 --> 00:51:51,279
they're they're primarily after the fuel

1241
00:51:48,239 --> 00:51:53,598
and the the biodiesel and the biog gases

1242
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:55,000
and then they have this black stuff this

1243
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:57,680
solid material at the end like hey what

1244
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:00,480
do I do with this and and you know using

1245
00:51:57,679 --> 00:52:02,199
it in a growing media is a is a real

1246
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:03,679
obvious choice but I yeah they they need

1247
00:52:02,199 --> 00:52:06,318
to get the price down a little more or

1248
00:52:03,679 --> 00:52:08,639
at least not rely on Growers to

1249
00:52:06,318 --> 00:52:09,880
subsidize that fraction of it for them

1250
00:52:08,639 --> 00:52:12,920
if they're going to be making money off

1251
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:15,720
the gas and the fuel from uh you know

1252
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:17,760
the pyresis and but um that that's

1253
00:52:15,719 --> 00:52:19,318
usually you know how the conversation

1254
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:20,920
starts there's a supply of it and then

1255
00:52:19,318 --> 00:52:22,639
how do we get how do we use this you

1256
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:23,960
know sustainably and maybe make a little

1257
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:27,039
money from

1258
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:28,760
it yeah and I've seen um

1259
00:52:27,039 --> 00:52:30,199
that I've SE actually in Oregon my

1260
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:33,079
father was actually working with some

1261
00:52:30,199 --> 00:52:37,118
folks down there in terms of using uh

1262
00:52:33,079 --> 00:52:39,640
kilms to uh uh when they go out and and

1263
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:41,240
do logging for the forest slash to

1264
00:52:39,639 --> 00:52:43,000
sequester the carbon from the forest

1265
00:52:41,239 --> 00:52:44,639
slash and then create a byproduct then

1266
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,838
could either be put back onto the land

1267
00:52:44,639 --> 00:52:48,960
or potentially sold to offset some of

1268
00:52:46,838 --> 00:52:51,279
the costs associated with setting up

1269
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:53,760
biotar kills um so yeah biochar is

1270
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:55,839
something I think is great uh and it is

1271
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:58,160
carbon positive in terms of sequestering

1272
00:52:55,838 --> 00:53:01,639
carbon versus the carbon loss that we

1273
00:52:58,159 --> 00:53:03,719
would normally see with um the timber

1274
00:53:01,639 --> 00:53:05,159
industry so I think that's I think

1275
00:53:03,719 --> 00:53:08,399
that's a really good one that you

1276
00:53:05,159 --> 00:53:10,279
brought up and and we've seen um we

1277
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:11,280
we've done some some trials ourselves

1278
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:13,359
and but there's actually a lot of

1279
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:16,280
research around biochar um but we've

1280
00:53:13,358 --> 00:53:19,078
seen better growth uh plant growth by

1281
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:22,400
using baar even as low as 5% of our

1282
00:53:19,079 --> 00:53:25,640
media um which sort of surprised me in

1283
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:26,798
some ways um but um yeah I definitely

1284
00:53:25,639 --> 00:53:28,759
think it's something that people should

1285
00:53:26,798 --> 00:53:30,400
consider it in their substrate if we're

1286
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:32,440
having a substrate conversation like

1287
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:36,440
this I'm I didn't think to bring it up

1288
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:37,720
and I'm so glad you did um yeah well and

1289
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:39,240
you know you brought up an interesting

1290
00:53:37,719 --> 00:53:41,759
point and it's funny because I used to

1291
00:53:39,239 --> 00:53:43,919
say the exact same thing biochar is a

1292
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:45,960
lot like compost you got to consider

1293
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:47,400
what was the feed stock originally

1294
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:49,599
because that will determine a lot the

1295
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:51,880
chemical properties when when you create

1296
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:53,960
the biochar how was it processed you

1297
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:55,559
know just like how was it composted you

1298
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:58,400
know what was the pro how was it

1299
00:53:55,559 --> 00:54:01,319
pyrolyzed and then we're post treatment

1300
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:03,798
you know uh post pyrolysis treatments

1301
00:54:01,318 --> 00:54:05,759
that were applied but yeah not all

1302
00:54:03,798 --> 00:54:07,679
biochars are not created equally they

1303
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:09,880
they vary incredibly depending on what

1304
00:54:07,679 --> 00:54:12,279
you started from and and how it was pyro

1305
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:15,039
you know pyrolyzed so um there a very

1306
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:17,640
good point it considering it as as you

1307
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:19,759
would compost not all are created

1308
00:54:17,639 --> 00:54:21,239
equal yeah and people ask you know can I

1309
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:23,160
just go down to Home Depot and buy some

1310
00:54:21,239 --> 00:54:27,959
charcoal throw that in my soil and a lot

1311
00:54:23,159 --> 00:54:30,960
of times that's not um pyol ized uh to

1312
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:32,760
the extent that we want for um biochar

1313
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,400
and also it may contain heavy metals and

1314
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:36,559
other toxins because they're not looking

1315
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:39,079
to create the same quality product that

1316
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:43,839
we may want for Horticulture at least is

1317
00:54:39,079 --> 00:54:45,839
is my knowledge around it um I wanted to

1318
00:54:43,838 --> 00:54:48,798
before before you go I did want to talk

1319
00:54:45,838 --> 00:54:50,838
about these wood substrate Alternatives

1320
00:54:48,798 --> 00:54:52,639
because I think um it's something that

1321
00:54:50,838 --> 00:54:54,480
I've looked into and I personally have

1322
00:54:52,639 --> 00:54:57,078
not had a lot of success with them in

1323
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:59,760
terms of creating the same level plant

1324
00:54:57,079 --> 00:55:01,480
health and plant growth uh but I'm not

1325
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:02,839
going to attribute that to the media or

1326
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:05,079
the substrate I'll just say that that's

1327
00:55:02,838 --> 00:55:07,838
on me um I'd love to hear your thoughts

1328
00:55:05,079 --> 00:55:10,599
around it and one thing that I do want

1329
00:55:07,838 --> 00:55:14,078
to bring up uh before I let you talk

1330
00:55:10,599 --> 00:55:16,920
about it is the fact that on on soil

1331
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:18,400
bags the way the labeling Works around

1332
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:20,400
these products is you may see them

1333
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:23,880
listed as Forest

1334
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:26,440
byproducts uh pine bark pine bark fines

1335
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:28,440
um and a variety of other names and like

1336
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:31,440
biochar or like compost that could speak

1337
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:33,159
to anything from you know high quality

1338
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:35,440
pine bark finds that are going to have

1339
00:55:33,159 --> 00:55:36,798
good results potentially in your mix to

1340
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:39,000
something like sawdust that's just may

1341
00:55:36,798 --> 00:55:41,038
be added as a filler so it's very

1342
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,880
challenging as a grower to determine

1343
00:55:41,039 --> 00:55:44,799
what you're getting in a bag without

1344
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:46,640
doing a little bit more digging I guess

1345
00:55:44,798 --> 00:55:50,159
the labeling doesn't give it all

1346
00:55:46,639 --> 00:55:53,838
way yeah that's right and you know I I

1347
00:55:50,159 --> 00:55:56,358
my guess is that the larger commercial

1348
00:55:53,838 --> 00:55:59,480
uh substrate providers are going to do a

1349
00:55:56,358 --> 00:56:02,480
better job at guaranteeing what comes in

1350
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:04,920
that bag than what you might find from

1351
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:07,240
like say like a Home Depot or just going

1352
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:09,079
down to the garden center and products

1353
00:56:07,239 --> 00:56:10,598
that are and I know this from personal

1354
00:56:09,079 --> 00:56:12,559
experience products that are geared

1355
00:56:10,599 --> 00:56:16,160
toward homeowners they'll fill that bag

1356
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:17,798
with anything um where the manufacturers

1357
00:56:16,159 --> 00:56:21,318
when they're selling it to a commercial

1358
00:56:17,798 --> 00:56:22,960
grower that needs crop uniformity from

1359
00:56:21,318 --> 00:56:25,798
not only within a crop but from year to

1360
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:27,519
year and you know crop to crop they're

1361
00:56:25,798 --> 00:56:29,239
they're much more conscious about what

1362
00:56:27,519 --> 00:56:31,559
they're putting in and making sure it

1363
00:56:29,239 --> 00:56:34,919
falls within certain um quality

1364
00:56:31,559 --> 00:56:36,160
standards so uh but the that that's my

1365
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:39,119
experience when you when you're when

1366
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:40,838
you're using a homeowner geared product

1367
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:43,880
it's it's you never know what's in there

1368
00:56:40,838 --> 00:56:46,960
it's just the wild west it you have no

1369
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:48,358
idea so when you say p pine bark finds

1370
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:50,920
you kind of described that a little bit

1371
00:56:48,358 --> 00:56:52,318
or bark finds um can you talk a little

1372
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:56,400
bit about sort of the physical

1373
00:56:52,318 --> 00:56:57,960
properties um as well as what what sort

1374
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:59,480
of percentages people are using them in

1375
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:02,960
and what sort of results we're seeing in

1376
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:06,280
horiculture right now so with pine bark

1377
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:07,838
and pine bark fines um and that can mean

1378
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:09,960
a lot of different things so you know we

1379
00:57:07,838 --> 00:57:12,920
would generally look at a particle size

1380
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:14,599
distribution of those but um you're

1381
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:17,639
never going to get the water holding

1382
00:57:14,599 --> 00:57:20,960
capacity that you would find with Pete

1383
00:57:17,639 --> 00:57:23,480
and no matter how fine you go with these

1384
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:25,358
pine bark fines Pete Moss is just going

1385
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:26,719
to be a little better holding water and

1386
00:57:25,358 --> 00:57:30,239
buffering water

1387
00:57:26,719 --> 00:57:31,879
um water buffering capacity uh I also

1388
00:57:30,239 --> 00:57:35,479
believe that the

1389
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:38,519
um you know the C exchange capacity and

1390
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:40,838
the the the the pH buffering in Pete is

1391
00:57:38,519 --> 00:57:44,960
a little better than it would be in pine

1392
00:57:40,838 --> 00:57:47,119
bark fines um generally speaking um you

1393
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:51,679
could use 100% pine bark to grow an

1394
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:54,160
outdoor Nursery crop um it what what

1395
00:57:51,679 --> 00:57:57,000
kind of our ideal substrate in Ohio

1396
00:57:54,159 --> 00:57:59,519
would be something like 80% Pine 20%

1397
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:01,760
sagum Peete that will grow a really good

1398
00:57:59,519 --> 00:58:03,159
crop now of course then you have to add

1399
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:05,039
you know a little bit of lime and

1400
00:58:03,159 --> 00:58:06,558
fertilizers and everything else in that

1401
00:58:05,039 --> 00:58:09,440
but in terms of the physical components

1402
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:13,039
of the media that's a great crop for for

1403
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:16,079
an outdoor Woody plant um now when you

1404
00:58:13,039 --> 00:58:18,119
go into more herbaceous things smaller

1405
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:20,000
plants the smaller the plant the more

1406
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:21,838
sensitive it's going to be to the

1407
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:24,838
chemical and physical properties of the

1408
00:58:21,838 --> 00:58:27,000
growing media so that's where Pete Moss

1409
00:58:24,838 --> 00:58:31,000
generally does a lot better than pine

1410
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:32,880
bark wood but large robust Woody plants

1411
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,519
we have a saying you can put 20% of

1412
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:37,358
anything in those pots and it's going to

1413
00:58:34,519 --> 00:58:40,239
grow just the same um now they're all

1414
00:58:37,358 --> 00:58:44,358
that but they're just more robust to

1415
00:58:40,239 --> 00:58:46,519
less ideal you know uh substrates than

1416
00:58:44,358 --> 00:58:48,440
than than a a small Flor culture crop or

1417
00:58:46,519 --> 00:58:52,318
perhaps you know cannabis plants and

1418
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:54,039
maybe a one or two gallon pot um so that

1419
00:58:52,318 --> 00:58:56,239
that's my experience with pine bark and

1420
00:58:54,039 --> 00:58:58,319
pine bark finds makes for an excellent

1421
00:58:56,239 --> 00:59:01,479
growing media the primary component used

1422
00:58:58,318 --> 00:59:03,318
for nursery crops um but it when you

1423
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:05,199
start growing you know again more

1424
00:59:03,318 --> 00:59:07,159
araceous or smaller plants you have to

1425
00:59:05,199 --> 00:59:09,358
be a little more selective and careful

1426
00:59:07,159 --> 00:59:11,358
with what you're you know

1427
00:59:09,358 --> 00:59:12,719
using one other thing that we haven't

1428
00:59:11,358 --> 00:59:14,798
really talked about I just want to bring

1429
00:59:12,719 --> 00:59:16,719
up too is sort of the uh because when I

1430
00:59:14,798 --> 00:59:18,159
think about a substrate and I've

1431
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:19,919
mentioned this on the podcast a lot of

1432
00:59:18,159 --> 00:59:21,879
times that I'm looking at a substrate

1433
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:23,318
from about essentially like three

1434
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:25,280
different pillars like I want to look at

1435
00:59:23,318 --> 00:59:28,239
the the physical properties of that

1436
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:30,039
substrate the chemical properties So

1437
00:59:28,239 --> 00:59:31,399
like um where's the pH what sort of

1438
00:59:30,039 --> 00:59:32,960
minerals is contained and then lastly

1439
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:34,480
the biological properties of that

1440
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:36,318
substrate and we haven't talked about

1441
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:38,519
biology at all and and one thing with

1442
00:59:36,318 --> 00:59:40,400
Pete Moss um and I can say this just

1443
00:59:38,519 --> 00:59:43,079
from looking down a microscope is it's

1444
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:46,000
biologically active it contains good

1445
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:49,119
biology whereas some of these other

1446
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:50,719
substrates like cocoe or um pine bark

1447
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:53,440
findes that would have to be introduced

1448
00:59:50,719 --> 00:59:55,598
it's not going to come in with any sort

1449
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:58,559
of nutrient cycling on organic side in

1450
00:59:55,599 --> 00:59:59,920
terms of the the the biology in that uh

1451
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:02,280
substrate do you want to touch on that

1452
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:03,838
at all yeah that's actually something

1453
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:07,000
we've been working on a lot for the last

1454
01:00:03,838 --> 01:00:09,279
five to 10 years now going back since we

1455
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:11,719
started using growing media in the

1456
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:13,760
1960s studying the biology has been

1457
01:00:11,719 --> 01:00:16,279
incredibly difficult because you're

1458
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:18,880
limited to studying maybe one or two

1459
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:20,960
pathogens or say beneficial organisms

1460
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:22,480
like Michael risey one or two things at

1461
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:25,159
a time and only things that you can

1462
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:27,880
plate in a Petri dish other organisms

1463
01:00:25,159 --> 01:00:30,480
are just too difficult to quantify or or

1464
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:33,838
anything else now with the Advent of DNA

1465
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:35,838
Technologies say 15 or 20 years ago and

1466
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:38,239
around 10 or 15 years ago they became

1467
01:00:35,838 --> 01:00:41,960
very affordable in an agricultural

1468
01:00:38,239 --> 01:00:44,078
research sense so now using uh DNA

1469
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:46,440
sequencing technology we're just

1470
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:48,440
starting to look at the microbiome in

1471
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:51,358
growing media you can find several

1472
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:56,119
papers out there now um what I would say

1473
01:00:51,358 --> 01:00:58,558
is the the the microbiome

1474
01:00:56,119 --> 01:01:00,358
depends on what you start with and on

1475
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:02,440
Day Zero they're going to be very

1476
01:01:00,358 --> 01:01:05,038
different in containers filled with

1477
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:06,559
different Media or even compost but

1478
01:01:05,039 --> 01:01:09,400
after two or three months in that

1479
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:11,359
growing media under those conditions

1480
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:13,400
with the irrigation the fertility the

1481
01:01:11,358 --> 01:01:15,199
temperature all the environmental

1482
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:17,960
conditions that you have that's going to

1483
01:01:15,199 --> 01:01:20,960
select for a certain consortia of you

1484
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:22,519
know a microbial community and no matter

1485
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:24,358
what you started with a lot of that's

1486
01:01:22,519 --> 01:01:26,960
going to die out because it just can't

1487
01:01:24,358 --> 01:01:28,880
survive in that environment what we find

1488
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:30,920
is if we start with different media of

1489
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:33,519
different composts or different you know

1490
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:36,240
components they tend to look the same

1491
01:01:33,519 --> 01:01:38,400
after about three months in the same

1492
01:01:36,239 --> 01:01:40,159
environment so it's kind of like I tell

1493
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:42,720
people if you want to increase the

1494
01:01:40,159 --> 01:01:44,719
biodiversity of the North Pole you took

1495
01:01:42,719 --> 01:01:46,919
a bunch of tigers lions and zebras up

1496
01:01:44,719 --> 01:01:49,558
there after about a week you have a

1497
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:51,519
bunch of dead lions tigers and zebras so

1498
01:01:49,559 --> 01:01:54,119
it's not so much what you put into that

1499
01:01:51,519 --> 01:01:57,119
media it's what what will the

1500
01:01:54,119 --> 01:02:00,039
environmental factors sustain in terms

1501
01:01:57,119 --> 01:02:01,480
of you know microbial organisms growing

1502
01:02:00,039 --> 01:02:03,400
um one of my colleagues here at Ohio

1503
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:04,679
State University she did something

1504
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:07,240
really clever she was looking for

1505
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:10,239
beneficial bacteria and she collected

1506
01:02:07,239 --> 01:02:13,558
her sources from a commercial Greenhouse

1507
01:02:10,239 --> 01:02:16,038
so those bacteria if she found you know

1508
01:02:13,559 --> 01:02:17,760
plant growth promoting properties within

1509
01:02:16,039 --> 01:02:20,240
those bacteria they are more likely to

1510
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:22,200
survive if you then apply them to other

1511
01:02:20,239 --> 01:02:24,838
containers and that that program is

1512
01:02:22,199 --> 01:02:27,038
actually working quite well um but it's

1513
01:02:24,838 --> 01:02:28,679
a it's it's something there's a lot of

1514
01:02:27,039 --> 01:02:30,278
snake oil out there a lot of Growers

1515
01:02:28,679 --> 01:02:33,199
will like to buy things because they

1516
01:02:30,278 --> 01:02:35,039
think it's biologically active and what

1517
01:02:33,199 --> 01:02:37,199
what does that even mean in in in a

1518
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:39,039
realistic sense it's whatever that

1519
01:02:37,199 --> 01:02:40,558
company wants it to mean that they're

1520
01:02:39,039 --> 01:02:44,480
that they're trying to sell the product

1521
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:46,440
to so um we're just starting to learn

1522
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:50,920
now about what actually lives in these

1523
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:52,798
container media and um and you know what

1524
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:55,680
you what will survive in a growing media

1525
01:02:52,798 --> 01:02:58,960
versus what you apply to that media so

1526
01:02:55,679 --> 01:03:00,960
it it's it is very a very young science

1527
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:02,838
we know a lot less about that than we

1528
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:04,639
know about the physical and the chemical

1529
01:03:02,838 --> 01:03:06,599
properties just because it's so hard to

1530
01:03:04,639 --> 01:03:08,798
measure and even now it's still really

1531
01:03:06,599 --> 01:03:10,559
expensive you just can't go out and and

1532
01:03:08,798 --> 01:03:12,920
it's it's it's really difficult to do

1533
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:14,599
it's it's you know measuring pH and EC

1534
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:16,760
or paracity those things are relatively

1535
01:03:14,599 --> 01:03:18,760
straightforward and simple me you know

1536
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:21,400
getting a good microbial Community

1537
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:23,000
analysis of a growing media takes a

1538
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:27,760
dedicated person who knows what they're

1539
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:29,480
doing and it's it's somewhat difficult

1540
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:31,240
so well I think that's really

1541
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:34,960
interesting about what you said

1542
01:03:31,239 --> 01:03:36,959
regarding um various substrates uh

1543
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:40,039
containing similar

1544
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:41,440
biological uh communities after a given

1545
01:03:40,039 --> 01:03:43,119
period of time just being in the same

1546
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:46,720
environment that's that's really

1547
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:51,519
interesting um one thing so to summarize

1548
01:03:46,719 --> 01:03:54,679
sort of your opinion on on microbes or

1549
01:03:51,519 --> 01:03:56,000
biology it's that um it's it's a side of

1550
01:03:54,679 --> 01:04:01,278
the industry that we're still learning a

1551
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:03,440
lot about um it's it's expensive and uh

1552
01:04:01,278 --> 01:04:07,278
maybe not the best tool for making

1553
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:11,519
diagnostic or uh you know datadriven

1554
01:04:07,278 --> 01:04:14,039
decisions about our cultivation habits

1555
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:17,278
that's yeah you're exactly right and

1556
01:04:14,039 --> 01:04:20,200
what what I what I know about

1557
01:04:17,278 --> 01:04:22,960
it is only the tip of the iceberg I mean

1558
01:04:20,199 --> 01:04:24,919
we know so little about those biological

1559
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:26,838
communities even if you looked at all

1560
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:29,880
the papers that been published to this

1561
01:04:26,838 --> 01:04:32,639
day it it it's just a small amount of

1562
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:35,039
information and we just we we know less

1563
01:04:32,639 --> 01:04:37,159
than what we know I mean there we have a

1564
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:39,079
lot to learn about that before we can

1565
01:04:37,159 --> 01:04:42,199
make any really

1566
01:04:39,079 --> 01:04:44,240
conclusive um decisions or you know give

1567
01:04:42,199 --> 01:04:46,318
it conclusive advice on what you should

1568
01:04:44,239 --> 01:04:48,038
or should not do all I'm talking about

1569
01:04:46,318 --> 01:04:51,239
is based on the scantest amount of

1570
01:04:48,039 --> 01:04:53,760
information what I've observed um on

1571
01:04:51,239 --> 01:04:56,239
some of the studies that we have done on

1572
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:59,000
how these communities start out and how

1573
01:04:56,239 --> 01:05:01,479
they change over time but again we have

1574
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:03,760
not done nearly enough research on this

1575
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:05,679
to um speak

1576
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:08,520
authoritatively and we just don't know

1577
01:05:05,679 --> 01:05:11,318
enough to to really say one way or the

1578
01:05:08,519 --> 01:05:14,798
other yeah I went to a talk by a soul

1579
01:05:11,318 --> 01:05:16,599
scientist uh at a college oh 10 15 years

1580
01:05:14,798 --> 01:05:19,159
ago now and one of the things he said

1581
01:05:16,599 --> 01:05:22,519
that really stuck with me was he said we

1582
01:05:19,159 --> 01:05:24,440
know more about the surface of the Moon

1583
01:05:22,519 --> 01:05:26,079
and the depths of our Ocean than we do

1584
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:28,639
with what's going on directly underneath

1585
01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:31,440
our feet um we just don't understand

1586
01:05:28,639 --> 01:05:33,679
that biology and it's so complex and I

1587
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:36,079
also got to attend at the international

1588
01:05:33,679 --> 01:05:38,278
Soul science Society of America

1589
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:42,480
conference one year oh it's a mouthful

1590
01:05:38,278 --> 01:05:46,519
um was uh a speaker that did research

1591
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:49,278
doing DNA analysis on agricultural lands

1592
01:05:46,519 --> 01:05:52,278
in relation to hydrology and so

1593
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:54,199
basically they measured um they they

1594
01:05:52,278 --> 01:05:57,039
they looked at all of what was in a soil

1595
01:05:54,199 --> 01:05:58,759
a soil uh when when the soil was dry and

1596
01:05:57,039 --> 01:06:00,200
then they came back after a rain and

1597
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:02,160
measured it and then maybe after a

1598
01:06:00,199 --> 01:06:05,358
watering event and then again let it dry

1599
01:06:02,159 --> 01:06:08,078
out and you saw a massive change in

1600
01:06:05,358 --> 01:06:10,038
fungal to bacteria uh ratios you saw a

1601
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:12,599
huge change in the Consortium microbes

1602
01:06:10,039 --> 01:06:15,200
that were present it's such a complex

1603
01:06:12,599 --> 01:06:17,680
community and yet I see people making

1604
01:06:15,199 --> 01:06:19,159
decisions about their cultivation habits

1605
01:06:17,679 --> 01:06:20,960
based off of what they see under a

1606
01:06:19,159 --> 01:06:23,159
microscope and I'm literally looking at

1607
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:24,960
my microscope over here because I it's

1608
01:06:23,159 --> 01:06:27,598
something that I like to do but I don't

1609
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:29,119
make I I use a chemical analysis a soil

1610
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:32,920
test because like you said we have very

1611
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:34,720
reliable metrics around EC pH um you

1612
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:36,440
know the levels of calcium and magnesium

1613
01:06:34,719 --> 01:06:38,318
and and potassium that we know a

1614
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:42,599
particular crop needs and so to me those

1615
01:06:38,318 --> 01:06:45,038
are more data driven uh variables than

1616
01:06:42,599 --> 01:06:47,200
the microbiome even though it is quite

1617
01:06:45,039 --> 01:06:49,559
important yeah you're absolutely right

1618
01:06:47,199 --> 01:06:52,118
that you just nailed it that's exactly

1619
01:06:49,559 --> 01:06:54,200
that's exactly my assessment of it now

1620
01:06:52,119 --> 01:06:56,119
and again we just spent five years doing

1621
01:06:54,199 --> 01:06:58,598
studies on the microbiome and we just

1622
01:06:56,119 --> 01:07:00,200
know so little that it's really hard to

1623
01:06:58,599 --> 01:07:03,680
make you know yet like you said data

1624
01:07:00,199 --> 01:07:05,199
driven um decisions based on you know

1625
01:07:03,679 --> 01:07:07,679
what we what we do

1626
01:07:05,199 --> 01:07:09,919
know yeah I mean we do know that compost

1627
01:07:07,679 --> 01:07:11,719
is this magical tool that we have in our

1628
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:13,278
Arsenal that we can add into soils and

1629
01:07:11,719 --> 01:07:15,000
see these because it is such a

1630
01:07:13,278 --> 01:07:18,079
concentration of microbes that we see

1631
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:20,000
such great results from it um when used

1632
01:07:18,079 --> 01:07:21,599
properly but in terms of identifying the

1633
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:23,838
microbes and I think that is a challenge

1634
01:07:21,599 --> 01:07:25,880
but I look forward to what you know what

1635
01:07:23,838 --> 01:07:30,000
research is coming out of uh your

1636
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:32,119
University and others on this topic yeah

1637
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:34,119
it's going to be slow I fear um just

1638
01:07:32,119 --> 01:07:36,358
because of the expense of it but it is

1639
01:07:34,119 --> 01:07:39,240
so it's it's really to me it's the Last

1640
01:07:36,358 --> 01:07:40,798
Frontier you know we we have we're

1641
01:07:39,239 --> 01:07:42,759
really good at the chemical and physical

1642
01:07:40,798 --> 01:07:45,798
properties but we need to be better at

1643
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:47,240
measuring and understanding how to well

1644
01:07:45,798 --> 01:07:49,119
first of all how to measure then how to

1645
01:07:47,239 --> 01:07:50,679
manage the biological properties because

1646
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:52,960
I think that's what Growers are really

1647
01:07:50,679 --> 01:07:54,558
looking to do um they understand the

1648
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:56,920
importance of the biological component

1649
01:07:54,559 --> 01:07:59,079
but we just don't know enough to know

1650
01:07:56,920 --> 01:08:00,240
how to manipulate it or how to use it to

1651
01:07:59,079 --> 01:08:01,839
our

1652
01:08:00,239 --> 01:08:04,919
advantage

1653
01:08:01,838 --> 01:08:06,400
great so there were two substrates that

1654
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:08,559
I wanted to ask you about that we didn't

1655
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:10,559
talk about um I'm kind of throwing you a

1656
01:08:08,559 --> 01:08:14,119
curveball here too have you heard of pit

1657
01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:16,359
Moss by chance it's a newspaper

1658
01:08:14,119 --> 01:08:18,560
cardboard based substrate I've I've

1659
01:08:16,359 --> 01:08:22,199
talked to the owner um we actually did

1660
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:24,279
some trials with it I personally wasn't

1661
01:08:22,198 --> 01:08:26,278
able to create a chemical analysis soil

1662
01:08:24,279 --> 01:08:28,480
test that I felt really comfortable in

1663
01:08:26,279 --> 01:08:32,000
utilizing but I think it's a really

1664
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:33,959
fascinating recycled product in terms of

1665
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:35,798
uh you know utilizing a waste stream

1666
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:39,359
into a potential

1667
01:08:35,798 --> 01:08:42,079
substrate it's a great story but I have

1668
01:08:39,359 --> 01:08:43,319
not seen evidence yet that it's going to

1669
01:08:42,079 --> 01:08:47,679
make an

1670
01:08:43,319 --> 01:08:50,000
effective commercial substrate um I I

1671
01:08:47,679 --> 01:08:51,920
would just say you know do your HK

1672
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:53,838
before you commit to doing anything with

1673
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:55,679
that product whether you or one of your

1674
01:08:53,838 --> 01:08:57,679
audience members you know do your

1675
01:08:55,679 --> 01:09:01,319
homework and make sure it works well in

1676
01:08:57,679 --> 01:09:02,679
your production system um because there

1677
01:09:01,319 --> 01:09:05,920
could be some

1678
01:09:02,679 --> 01:09:09,199
challenges okay and uh Dairy wash is the

1679
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:11,640
other one that I see at trade shows that

1680
01:09:09,198 --> 01:09:14,318
is another waste product that when I

1681
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:16,640
hold it in my hands and look at it it

1682
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:18,679
seems like it would be a very viable

1683
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:21,119
substrate it feels like it would grow

1684
01:09:18,679 --> 01:09:22,679
plants but I but with the high ph and

1685
01:09:21,119 --> 01:09:24,079
some of the other challenges around it I

1686
01:09:22,679 --> 01:09:26,199
haven't it's another one that I haven't

1687
01:09:24,079 --> 01:09:27,960
really had good success with have you

1688
01:09:26,198 --> 01:09:31,278
done any trials or seen any research on

1689
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:34,759
that as another option I have seen some

1690
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:36,640
of these um Dairy digestates and and

1691
01:09:34,759 --> 01:09:39,439
things like that and they they look just

1692
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:43,079
like Pete Moss and they feel they they

1693
01:09:39,439 --> 01:09:44,759
look and feel right but again you know

1694
01:09:43,079 --> 01:09:46,519
and I've seen several of these companies

1695
01:09:44,759 --> 01:09:49,759
come and go and their products come and

1696
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:53,040
go and none of them have been successful

1697
01:09:49,759 --> 01:09:55,719
none of them none of them I should say

1698
01:09:53,039 --> 01:09:58,719
not the companies but I have not able to

1699
01:09:55,719 --> 01:10:02,399
use those products successfully in you

1700
01:09:58,719 --> 01:10:04,039
know to to grow plants well now maybe

1701
01:10:02,399 --> 01:10:05,920
that's because I'm a bad horticulturist

1702
01:10:04,039 --> 01:10:07,399
but you know that's how I feel about

1703
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:09,840
myself with those too so it makes me

1704
01:10:07,399 --> 01:10:11,879
feel a little bit better uh but I would

1705
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:14,800
tell any of your listeners you know you

1706
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:17,480
know always try new things but you know

1707
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:20,760
do your homework and and really vet them

1708
01:10:17,479 --> 01:10:24,839
before you you know consider going you

1709
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:26,840
know all in on it because um I you know

1710
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:29,000
I've seen a lot of

1711
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:32,840
challenging they've not worked too well

1712
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:35,640
for most people that I you

1713
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:37,840
know the

1714
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:42,000
examples okay so just to summarize sort

1715
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:43,719
of our conversation today um Pete Moss

1716
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:46,000
does have an ecological impact an

1717
01:10:43,719 --> 01:10:48,480
environmental impact it may not be quite

1718
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:50,920
as Extreme as some of these the the

1719
01:10:48,479 --> 01:10:52,759
media stories are telling us and all of

1720
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:55,319
these other substrate options like cocoa

1721
01:10:52,760 --> 01:10:59,320
cor Rockwell perlite all have an

1722
01:10:55,319 --> 01:11:00,799
eological impact as well um biochar is

1723
01:10:59,319 --> 01:11:03,599
something that could absolutely be

1724
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:05,119
considered but check your you know check

1725
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:07,800
your quality do a little research before

1726
01:11:05,119 --> 01:11:10,039
incorporating it and then um some of

1727
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:13,360
these other Alternatives like the dairy

1728
01:11:10,039 --> 01:11:15,279
wash pine bark and uh pit Moss all have

1729
01:11:13,359 --> 01:11:18,000
challenges as well but maybe could be

1730
01:11:15,279 --> 01:11:21,198
incorporated in at smaller percentages

1731
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:24,479
than uh say just completely switching

1732
01:11:21,198 --> 01:11:27,039
over as a media maybe use it 10 or 20%

1733
01:11:24,479 --> 01:11:29,519
um but as of right now there is nothing

1734
01:11:27,039 --> 01:11:31,840
from a plant perspective in regards to

1735
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:34,520
substrates that's going to beat Pete

1736
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:36,840
Moss that's correct and one thing that I

1737
01:11:34,520 --> 01:11:40,159
tell Growers too is this we've been

1738
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:43,199
using Pete Moss for 60 years and since

1739
01:11:40,158 --> 01:11:45,519
that time we have as we discussed

1740
01:11:43,198 --> 01:11:48,479
earlier we have engineered the right

1741
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:51,320
particle size you know we buffer the pH

1742
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:53,718
we we amend it with starter charges we

1743
01:11:51,319 --> 01:11:57,198
have you know wedding agents all that

1744
01:11:53,719 --> 01:12:00,158
and we we're very good at using Pete

1745
01:11:57,198 --> 01:12:04,319
Moss what if we put 60 years of that

1746
01:12:00,158 --> 01:12:06,479
same rigor and Research into using core

1747
01:12:04,319 --> 01:12:10,319
would it be as good because core is the

1748
01:12:06,479 --> 01:12:13,439
only product in my opinion that can be

1749
01:12:10,319 --> 01:12:17,158
used in the broad Spectra you know and

1750
01:12:13,439 --> 01:12:18,759
all the it could replace Pete in in in

1751
01:12:17,158 --> 01:12:21,000
many of the situations where you use

1752
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:22,400
Pete now there are challenges again as

1753
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:25,639
you mentioned with the ph and the

1754
01:12:22,399 --> 01:12:27,198
salinity sometimes and the quality um

1755
01:12:25,639 --> 01:12:29,719
but if we put the same amount of

1756
01:12:27,198 --> 01:12:32,678
research in the core could it be as good

1757
01:12:29,719 --> 01:12:35,840
as Pete that's you know so what can

1758
01:12:32,679 --> 01:12:37,480
replace Pete that that's my only in my

1759
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:40,239
opinion that's the only thing I know of

1760
01:12:37,479 --> 01:12:43,039
right now um there's some things that

1761
01:12:40,238 --> 01:12:45,879
need to be figured out but that that's

1762
01:12:43,039 --> 01:12:47,800
what I would tell Growers is um it has

1763
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:50,560
it has the potential but we just we put

1764
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:52,520
so much effort into refining the use

1765
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:54,679
refining sag and Pete Moss it's going to

1766
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:56,320
be really hard to just start using

1767
01:12:54,679 --> 01:12:57,679
something or find something else and say

1768
01:12:56,319 --> 01:12:59,960
hey let's try this and it's going to

1769
01:12:57,679 --> 01:13:02,600
work as well as Pete does we just we've

1770
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:06,359
engineered that so thoroughly well um

1771
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:06,360
it's a really great substrate
