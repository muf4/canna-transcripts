31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,719
israeli minister of agriculture his

32
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,640
early work focused on the study of plant

33
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:20,798
microorganism interactions

34
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,478
mainly in plant roots and their impact

35
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,640
on crop productivity

36
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:26,079
later he concentrated on identification

37
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,159
and utilization of natural

38
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:29,840
products produced by numerous plant

39
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,880
species and their health benefits to

40
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,439
humans

41
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:35,280

scientific journals and edited three

47
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:48,239
books now on to the show

48
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:50,559
dr kapolnik thank you for coming on the

49
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:54,000
show today i really appreciate it

50
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:57,359
thank you very much ted yes will be

51
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,959
waiting for that well i i have a whole

52
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:00,799
bunch of questions for you i think your

53
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:03,519
research is really interesting

54
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,719
but can we start off uh talking to

55
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:05,679
letting listeners know a little bit

56
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:09,038
about your

57
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:12,480
background and who you are

58
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:15,759
okay uh actually uh i'm a scientist

59
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:18,878
uh i obtained on my

60
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:21,359
degrees here in israel and uh

61
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:23,519
towards the end of my grade when i

62
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,959
graduate from my phd program

63
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:29,040
i went to the us and i

64
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,239
spent two and a half years in uc davis

65
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:33,519
as a postdoc

66
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:36,560
in the agronomy department and

67
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:39,680
then i went back home to israel

68
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:42,479
and i took a position in the uh

69
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,360
cultural research and the development

70
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:47,598
this is

71
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:49,920
actually an governmental institute

72
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:51,919
we call it the vulcanis center and

73
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:54,159
nothing about volcano

74
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:55,359
but this is the volcanic center which is

75
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:59,598
celebrating

76
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:01,920
now this year 100 years of existence

77
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:03,359
much before the state of israel was

78
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:06,639
former

79
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,400
people here try to develop

80
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:10,079
agriculture knowledge in order to be

81
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,439
able to supply their

82
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:16,560
food so i joined

83
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:19,919
the the plant

84
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,759
the the field crop department and i

85
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:24,798
served

86
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:29,759
as a scientist for 30 years

87
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:32,480
uh along my research i took a lot of

88
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:32,959
administration position and the last one

89
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:35,359
was

90
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,799
i was the head of the aro the catcher

91
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,000
research organization the volcanic

92
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,360
center

93
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,840
which consisted of

94
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:48,080
out of 1200

95
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:52,479
employees scientists

96
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:56,480
technicians and students and

97
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:58,959
in this institute i dived into

98
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:00,479
what we call it rhizosphal biology

99
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:04,319
rhizosphere is the

100
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:05,840
closed niche around the roots

101
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:07,438
which is actually the soil which is

102
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,640
surrounding the roots

103
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:13,120
and there's a lot of biology is

104
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:14,559
happening there and not just biology

105
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,600
chemistry and physics

106
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:20,639
everything is actually concentrated to

107
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:24,320
the first one or two millimeters

108
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:27,918
of the root surfaces and i

109
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:29,040
studied a lot of plant microbe

110
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:33,120
interaction

111
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:37,120
as well as uh roots physiology

112
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:40,959
so this is my background the rhizosphere

113
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:43,280
and the biology and during my academic

114
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:43,839
year i taught in the hebrew university a

115
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:46,478
course

116
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:47,039
a course this is a graduate course which

117
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:50,240
is a

118
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:53,680
root structure and function so

119
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,759
in a way we hold the issue from

120
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,120
both ends from the plant side and from

121
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,000
the soil side

122
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,639
and the arena is the rhizosphere as i

123
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,639
just mentioned

124
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:09,919
well you have a fascinating background i

125
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,960
i study you know on my own time a lot of

126
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:12,879
the

127
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:14,719
the rhizospheres interactions that

128
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:18,478
you're talking about

129
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:20,720
um purely for my own education

130
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:22,639
and it seems like such a complex

131
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:26,160
interaction between

132
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:30,079
uh microbes

133
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:33,520
their exudates the root exudates and

134
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:35,839
the the mineral content of the soil

135
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:36,959
before we dive into some of this stuff

136
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:38,959
some of the questions i had about

137
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:41,599
mycorrhizal fungus can you kind of

138
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:44,159
summarize the the symbiosis of that

139
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,080
relationship and how it how it works

140
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,759
um you know the basic version that i

141
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:49,519
that i would put out there is the plants

142
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,199
releasing exudates into this

143
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:53,839
into the soil that the microbes then

144
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,600
consume and cycle nutrients

145
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:57,839
back to the plant in addition to

146
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,360
breaking down the organic matter and

147
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:01,198
other minerals that are

148
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,720
existing in the soil and the plant kind

149
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,360
of controls this react in this

150
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,319
interaction

151
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,680
based off of the exudates that it's

152
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,160
releasing in the

153
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,439
and the chemicals it's producing um

154
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,039
itself can you kind of

155
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:14,560
elaborate a little bit on that or talk

156
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:16,399
about um

157
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,360
that relationship or even correct me if

158
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:21,279
i if i stated anything wrong

159
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,479
i i think that you were right uh

160
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:24,879
generally but

161
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:26,719
you know i just to the sick of uh you

162
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:28,159
know for our audience

163
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,000
they need to understand that there is

164
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:33,439
not kind of a passive

165
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:37,038
uh kind of a licking system that uh

166
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:39,839
incidentally the plant is losing uh

167
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:42,478
the one molecule or two molecules we are

168
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:44,799
talking here about a massive phenomena

169
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:46,399
uh uh about thirty percent of the

170
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,840
photosynthetic i mean all the

171
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:48,719
carbohydrates that the plant is

172
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:51,758
accumulated

173
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:55,599
through the photosynthesis is actually

174
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:58,720
find its way at the end of the day or

175
00:06:55,598 --> 00:07:01,839
along the whole relationship

176
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,440
in the soil in the rhizosphere and so

177
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:05,679
this is a very rich

178
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:06,719
environment relative to to the soil

179
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,680
itself

180
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,639
uh you find there in the root exudated a

181
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,598
lot of

182
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,400
sugars of course but also vitamins amino

183
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:17,120
acids

184
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:18,239
are you know uh nucleic acid uh

185
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,680
molecules like

186
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:25,199
dna and rna i mean whatever you think

187
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:28,240
of uh the plant uh content

188
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:30,400
or the cell content sorry so you can

189
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,560
find it in the rhinosphere in

190
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:34,959
in a certain concentration and that's

191
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,800
actually drive the whole biology because

192
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:40,000
you have uh

193
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,038
consumers of those goodies which are

194
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,439
being supplied

195
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:46,079
by the plan and there is competition to

196
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:49,199
to reach them

197
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:52,639
so it's a very very active region

198
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:55,680
and uh you we have to remember

199
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:58,800
that uh you know uh the tip of

200
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,439
the plant the tip of the roots is not

201
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,319
like

202
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:03,598
a more mature part of the roots uh the

203
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,720
exudates or

204
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:10,079
the chemistry that you will find around

205
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,720
the the the root tip is totally

206
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:14,000
different

207
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:16,800
from the elongation zone

208
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,120
or from the branch zone each one of them

209
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,199
has

210
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:24,639
its own or different exudation mechanism

211
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:27,520
and that actually influencing the

212
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,960
influencing the the biology around it

213
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:32,478
and uh

214
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:33,278
once uh the plant uh well now now uh if

215
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:37,120
we take it

216
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:38,080
one level further uh uh there is a lot

217
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,879
of

218
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,839
saying there i mean talking about

219
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:44,000
chemistry uh

220
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,120
discussion between the plant and the

221
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,320
microbes

222
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:51,600
and some of them uh can even

223
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:54,240
reach farther and penetrate uh to the

224
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,959
tissue to the plant itself and

225
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,720
of course to uh through uh the

226
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:01,199
evolutionary process

227
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,120
that uh you need really to provide

228
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,519
something good that the plant will allow

229
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,720
you

230
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:10,639
up you know to to break in and to enter

231
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,120
to the roots itself so uh we find a lot

232
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:13,120
of

233
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,560
several groups uh many of you probably

234
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:18,000
are uh

235
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:18,719
familiar with uh the nitrogen fixation

236
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,679
system

237
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,000
these are rhizobia which penetrating to

238
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:24,559
the

239
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,919
legume plant and really fix nitrogen so

240
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:28,879
in a situation

241
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:29,278
where the plants have a flight enough

242
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:32,320
other

243
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:33,360
nutrients but uh uh a shortage in

244
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,399
nitrogen

245
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:39,839
uh actually this biological system uh

246
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:42,159
can uh really feed the entire

247
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,880
uh needs of the plant and this is

248
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:46,240
something which

249
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:48,080
uh is very uh it's uh

250
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,200
it's being used in agriculture like

251
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:54,399
peanuts and soy beans

252
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:57,519
are being inoculated and

253
00:09:54,399 --> 00:10:00,958
we can actually we were able

254
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:02,240
to tie them in to our conventional

255
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:04,159
agriculture

256
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,680
another group of microorganisms these

257
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:08,639
are mycorrhizae

258
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:09,519
now the mycorrhizae we have two distinct

259
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:12,000
uh

260
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,120
at least two distinct groups some of

261
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,440
which

262
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,480
are not really penetrating to the plant

263
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,519
itself

264
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,519
these are the ectomycorrhizal fungi

265
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,519
it's a lot of plant species which are

266
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:28,159
belong to that

267
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:28,159
and most of them are colonizing uh

268
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:36,240
perennial like trees and shrubs

269
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:38,159
conifers excuse me

270
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,159
yeah so we think of i think of conifers

271
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:42,240
when i think of ecto

272
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:43,838
exactly like like conifer a lot of

273
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,839
mushrooms and

274
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,279
you know uh there's a lot of extra micro

275
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:52,000
as the 500 which

276
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:56,159
we know uh which has some gastronomic uh

277
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,958
uh uh effect and um

278
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:59,519
in in a way and now i would like to

279
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:01,278
drive

280
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,799
to drag the discussion to the other

281
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:05,838
group the second group

282
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:08,958
those type of fungi which

283
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:12,240
has the ability which

284
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:16,639
with the evolutionary process

285
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:19,600
were able to try to to

286
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:20,799
colonize the tissue itself so if you

287
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,800
look on the roots

288
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:24,399
under the microscope you'll be able to

289
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:27,278
see the hyphae

290
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,399
of the endomycorrhizal fungi actually

291
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:31,600
spreading

292
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:34,240
in in the in the root tissue

293
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,000
not only that but some of these fungi

294
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:40,639
not all of them

295
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:44,078
can really produce some what we call it

296
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:47,278
vesicles the vesicles are uh storage

297
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:49,039
uh bodies so not only they they can

298
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:50,720
they found they can grow in the

299
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:54,000
rhizosphere and

300
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:57,200
like you uh describe very right

301
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,480
that it can absorb some

302
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:03,440
nutrients and minerals and translocated

303
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,159
to the tissue to the plant itself the

304
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,279
fungi

305
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:10,559
the the fungus can even store

306
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:13,919
it for a while in the tissue itself

307
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:17,039
in a way it's uh being protected and it

308
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:20,319
is ready uh to to use

309
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:21,679
uh in the in the in the roots itself in

310
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,120
some of the cases

311
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:28,319
the plant was able uh even kind of

312
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:32,000
you know if i'll describe it simply

313
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:34,879
to full a little bit of fungus and to

314
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,200
in a way uh to consume some of the of

315
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:38,720
this

316
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,920
storage uh without permission and uh

317
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,399
that's some uh

318
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:44,799
some uh this is kind of we call it uh uh

319
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:47,679
uh symbiosis but in a way

320
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:48,159
uh each one of these parties is trying

321
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:52,000
to make

322
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:55,039
living out of uh this situation

323
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,278
so uh in a situation that the plant is

324
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:58,799
suffering from lack of for some minerals

325
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:02,078
and these minerals can be

326
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:05,199
somehow collected and transported

327
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:08,319
to the tissue itself uh in in

328
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,519
you know in in extra in exchange uh the

329
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,639
fungus is actually

330
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:16,159
receiving a lot of the photosynthesis uh

331
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:19,839
photosynthetic which are uh coming from

332
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:21,679
the leaves uh to the roots so uh well

333
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:24,160
the fungus cannot do it

334
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:26,319
i mean if you will take the endomycolasa

335
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:29,519
function and we try to feed it

336
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,839
uh artificially by any other

337
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,600
type of sugars we probably will not be

338
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,600
able to do it

339
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,800
on a petri dish in the laboratory

340
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,560
condition i mean

341
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:43,679
the fungus really need vigors and

342
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:46,719
roots which is uh which is a live life

343
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:49,198
and then

344
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,959
comes another layer of question how

345
00:13:49,198 --> 00:13:54,240
comes that the plant

346
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:58,799
is uh allowing the fungus to penetrate

347
00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:01,360
and to spread out in the tissue itself

348
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:03,599
while when a pathogen is trying to do

349
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,079
the same the plane is responding with

350
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,879
the

351
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:08,638
plant defense response and we know that

352
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:09,360
the plant has the ability to defend

353
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,399
itself

354
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,039
and the question is uh why mycorrhizal

355
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,559
fungi

356
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:20,159
are able to spread in the tissue while

357
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:21,838
uh other pathogens sometimes are being

358
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,879
blocked in many cases they are being

359
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,839
blocked

360
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:26,559
or the plant is trying at least to fight

361
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,399
back

362
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:33,599
and to prevent that penetration

363
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:35,440
and colonization and you know this is a

364
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,399
long story and we studied these

365
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,440
processes for

366
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:41,360
for many years and to make a long story

367
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,199
short i can tell you that somehow the

368
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:46,720
mycorrhizae fungi

369
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:50,159
they are able to turn off

370
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:53,440
their the plant defense uh

371
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:55,519
respawn uh like kind of this

372
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,279
type of conversation and telling that

373
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:00,639
the plant listen guys

374
00:14:57,278 --> 00:15:04,078
here comes the good guys don't uh

375
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:06,399
uh aim your ammunition against us

376
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:08,399
because we are uh at the end of the day

377
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:11,360
we are trying to help you

378
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,159
uh we are we we the fungus try to help

379
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,919
the plant

380
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:18,240
and that's the benefit of the plan

381
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:20,240
so you know i described it a little bit

382
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,839
and you're right the rhizosphere

383
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:27,360
is a very interesting and active region

384
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:31,199
and some of those

385
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:34,320
organisms were able to identify a unique

386
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:34,319
mechanism by which

387
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:41,198
it will be justified to

388
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,879
really to create uh that symbiosis what

389
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:45,599
we call it uh

390
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:46,078
for the uh mycorrhizae and rhizobium

391
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,120
which

392
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:52,078
i just described uh now

393
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,639
yeah that was great uh you know you i

394
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:55,679
never

395
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:58,399
thought of it as

396
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:59,359
potentially in the same way as i would a

397
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,879
pathogen but

398
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,199
that makes a lot of sense that it would

399
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:06,159
need to somehow

400
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:09,679
shut down that plant response as that

401
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:11,519
that sort of pathogen response

402
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:13,919
and you mentioned some of the benefits

403
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:16,720
around this is it's a storage

404
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:19,679
of nutrients it provides more nutrients

405
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,920
it extends sort of the root system

406
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:23,519
or the ability of the root system what

407
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:24,958
are some of the other benefits of

408
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,320
mycorrhizal fungus because

409
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:28,879
one of the main ones we always hear

410
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:31,120
about is phosphorus uptake

411
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:32,399
um what what are what do you think of

412
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,320
when you think of

413
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:37,278
that association though in terms of the

414
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:40,079
plant benefit from it

415
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:41,039
okay so so first of all uh just to to

416
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:43,439
make it my

417
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:44,078
much more well it's not just fossils of

418
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,639
course

419
00:16:44,078 --> 00:16:49,198
uh here we're talking about uh most of

420
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:52,799
those elements which are not uh

421
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:54,639
which are not uh moving easily uh

422
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:57,120
in the soil solution you know that in

423
00:16:54,639 --> 00:17:00,079
the soil we have the physical structure

424
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,120
and we have the the the in between those

425
00:17:00,078 --> 00:17:04,240
particles

426
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,279
uh we have the uh the water which is

427
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,959
moving uh

428
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:08,639
and a lot of minerals are being

429
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:12,240
dissolved there but

430
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:15,038
like iron and man are

431
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,679
being phosphorus are being attached to

432
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:18,400
the

433
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,959
to the solid surface and that are not

434
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,038
easily

435
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:25,279
moved with the uh with the soil solution

436
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:27,199
so first of all mycorrhizae helps to the

437
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:30,639
plant to reach out

438
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:34,558
and to uh receive more

439
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:36,799
of those aimings this is the first thing

440
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:37,678
another thing which is a very clear to

441
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:40,319
us uh

442
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,960
that something in the physiology of the

443
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:44,000
roots

444
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,679
is is being is

445
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,200
altered by the existence of the

446
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,600
mycorrhizae

447
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,759
we know that the resistance to plant

448
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:53,759
nematodes is much much higher when you

449
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:56,319
have mycorrhitic plan

450
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:57,759
now another benefit which is well known

451
00:17:56,319 --> 00:18:00,399
at the plant level

452
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:01,879
is uh there is kind of an enhanced

453
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:05,038
enhancement of the

454
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:07,360
photosynthetic uh which uh

455
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:09,200
well in a way the mycorrhizae is

456
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:12,319
charging the plant

457
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,038
uh but in the same time it's helping the

458
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:15,519
plants

459
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:16,558
to gain more photosynthesis how it's

460
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:19,119
being done

461
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:20,480
is being done by altering a little bit

462
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:23,839
the

463
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:27,599
very very simple

464
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:28,079
and unique molecules we call it we can

465
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:31,439
call it

466
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:32,720
uh hormone-like molecules are moving in

467
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,600
the plant itself

468
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,160
and that signal is reaching the leaves

469
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:38,079
and

470
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,519
influencing the leaves itself it can

471
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:43,519
influence the

472
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:45,599
evaporation by stomach closure

473
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:48,160
i mean the plant is not losing so much

474
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:49,038
water but in the same time is enhancing

475
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,320
the

476
00:18:49,038 --> 00:18:53,519
the photosynthesis if we'll move out of

477
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:56,399
the plant

478
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:57,359
and we'll go back to the rhizosphere

479
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,400
something which is

480
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:01,918
really unique about mycorrhizae and this

481
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,519
is true to endo

482
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:09,120
and ectomycorrhizal as well is that that

483
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:10,558
hyphy the the fungus itself which is a

484
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:13,279
way which is somehow

485
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:14,079
growing or ex spreading away from the

486
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:16,319
plant

487
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:18,879
the fungus itself the hyphae is being

488
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:22,159
exudating also some moderate cold

489
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:25,440
some those molecules are in

490
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:28,880
enhancing the aggregation

491
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:32,240
of that's actually improving soil

492
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:34,080
properties if you have a small aggregate

493
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:37,679
you have in the soil

494
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:41,038
so the water tension tension and

495
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:42,960
the structure of the soil is much better

496
00:19:41,038 --> 00:19:44,640
the soap microwave helps the plant

497
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:48,960
tremendously at the

498
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:50,480
in this level and last and not least uh

499
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,798
now we are talking about the

500
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:56,400
communication between nearby

501
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:59,759
plants i mean that hyphae which is uh

502
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:02,640
uh to one of the plants it can

503
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:05,119
reach out to the neighbor plants to the

504
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,520
nearby plant and

505
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:07,799
we can see a lot of signals and even

506
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:09,119
some

507
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:11,038
[Music]

508
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:13,599
more which are moving uh by the

509
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:15,839
mycorrhizae from one plant to

510
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:16,639
another another plant that's very

511
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:19,038
important

512
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,159
to uh when you're talking about feed

513
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:23,119
crop because

514
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:24,320
you know the field crops the plants are

515
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:26,879
so dense

516
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:28,079
and sometimes let's say water is not

517
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,120
reaching out uh

518
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:34,079
at the same level to every plant

519
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:36,479
and the mycorrhizae is there to somehow

520
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:40,158
to smooth the differences in the

521
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:43,440
in between the plants and to create

522
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:47,600
kind of a more unique uh uh

523
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:50,720
population of plants per a growing area

524
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:53,359
so this uh a lot of fostering i i

525
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,919
there's more and more things that which

526
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:55,839
can be

527
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,440
added to that but i think that i

528
00:20:55,839 --> 00:21:00,959
mentioned the the key

529
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,600
or the most important ones um the fact

530
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,079
that uh

531
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:05,038
well here i need to say to say something

532
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:08,558
which

533
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:10,720
in a way is a con conductor introductory

534
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:11,440
to the what i said a couple of minutes

535
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,000
ago

536
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,640
i told you that in order to spread into

537
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,880
the plan

538
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,000
there somehow the plant defense

539
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,600
mechanism

540
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:24,240
should be shut off but that reduction

541
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:25,839
in the ability of plant defense respond

542
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:29,038
is only

543
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:31,519
at for a short while it turns out

544
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:32,319
that the plant which is my critic is uh

545
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:36,480
when a

546
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:39,678
pathogen is reaching in uh

547
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:42,000
just after colonization with mycorrhizae

548
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:44,000
then the the you you the plant is

549
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,359
responding much more aggressively in

550
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,919
terms of

551
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:48,639
altering the plant defense bond fighting

552
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,759
back

553
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,440
uh uh when the pathogen is trying to

554
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:57,038
colonize the roots

555
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:58,798
so uh those type of changes uh

556
00:21:57,038 --> 00:22:00,240
on the physical side but also the

557
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:03,440
chemistry and the hormonal

558
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:06,240
side are very very clear

559
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,519
uh for that so so the plant which is

560
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:11,679
mycorrhitic

561
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:14,879
may be a little bit more sensitive

562
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:18,798
at the right in the next

563
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:20,159
vicinity to the uh literation attempt of

564
00:22:18,798 --> 00:22:23,038
the mycorrhizae

565
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,760
but after a while in a while i'm talking

566
00:22:23,038 --> 00:22:27,359
about

567
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:30,400
half a day a day everything is actually

568
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:32,240
retrieving back and the prac i mean the

569
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,320
plant

570
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,640
the plant is not exposed by the

571
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:37,678
mycorrhizae to a situation that it will

572
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:41,120
be weaker

573
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:43,280
it always created a stronger situation

574
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:44,879
later on

575
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:46,879
that makes sense so overall you're

576
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:50,000
getting a better

577
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,440
uh you're getting more ability of the

578
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,960
plant to protect itself

579
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:56,159
against pathogens when it has that

580
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,360
mycorrhizal

581
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:00,880
association over time yeah but

582
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:03,519
but you know we know from different

583
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:07,200
crops that even the flowering

584
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:10,400
is uh you can get an earlier

585
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:13,519
uh flowering on the plant

586
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:16,798
you need less date for to to flower

587
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:20,400
set which is very important

588
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:23,519
sometimes in agriculture

589
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:25,120
especially in a region which uh a dry

590
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:28,240
region you really want to

591
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:32,158
uh finish quickly your crop

592
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:35,599
so it's not a question only of

593
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:37,679
enhancing the mineral status or the

594
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:39,279
nutritional level of the plant

595
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,960
is a question of more kind of a

596
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:44,240
hormonalic

597
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:48,319
effect which just sets the flowering uh

598
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:52,480
a little bit earlier and that's very uh

599
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:56,240
not only earlier but more uniform even

600
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:58,880
we can see it on on tomato and

601
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,679
cucumbers all of them you can see the

602
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:03,360
flowering

603
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:04,000
coming earlier that's a that's amazing

604
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:06,798
so you're saying

605
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,079
earlier flower set and did i hear you

606
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:11,119
correctly when you said that

607
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:13,519
a mycorrhizal uh association

608
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:16,558
actually affects the the opening and

609
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:20,480
closing of the stomata

610
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:21,599
uh yes uh well we we ask ourselves how

611
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,480
come so you know

612
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:26,079
if the plant is uh you know when you

613
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:29,038
close the stomata

614
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:30,000
in a way you you're not losing water if

615
00:24:29,038 --> 00:24:31,839
you have

616
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,278
uh you know high temperature or dry

617
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:36,079
conditions

618
00:24:33,278 --> 00:24:36,400
but in the same time you block the pla i

619
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:39,519
mean

620
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:43,120
uh co2 it cannot uh carbo

621
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:46,798
co2 is not getting into the plant so

622
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:50,000
uh the machinery of photosynthesis is uh

623
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:50,319
in a way uh is slowing down because you

624
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,359
don't

625
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:56,480
know you don't have enough co2

626
00:24:53,359 --> 00:25:00,639
so what's really happening there is uh

627
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:03,519
that under dry conditions uh the

628
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,960
somehow the mycorrhizae is allowing the

629
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:08,158
stomata

630
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:12,400
staying a little bit uh more opening

631
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:15,278
on the stress uh uh when the stress

632
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:17,679
is uh uh how you call it when you

633
00:25:15,278 --> 00:25:21,119
initiate the stress on the plant

634
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,679
and uh when the stress is over and when

635
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:24,319
we are

636
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:25,038
talking about recovery the microarraytic

637
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:28,879
plant

638
00:25:25,038 --> 00:25:32,000
are able to open their stomata

639
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,360
earlier than uh plants which are not

640
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,359
mycorrhitic

641
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:39,359
so in a way your mycorrhitic plants are

642
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:42,879
using more effectively

643
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:46,399
their light hours or you know

644
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:49,679
more effectively uh the photosynthesis

645
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:51,759
uh process even though uh there are some

646
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:54,798
environmental stresses which are

647
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:58,480
which in a imposing

648
00:25:54,798 --> 00:26:01,519
uh stomata closure with mycorrhizae

649
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,079
you do it a little bit more smarter and

650
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:04,158
you

651
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:05,278
by that you're allowing the plant to

652
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:08,480
have more

653
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:11,519
co2 and to fix

654
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:14,798
the carbon uh

655
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:17,119
when a mycorrhitic when non-microretic

656
00:26:14,798 --> 00:26:19,278
plants cannot do it

657
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:20,399
that's that's amazing i've never heard

658
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:21,759
of that so that

659
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,600
i learned something new i really

660
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:26,640
appreciate that's amazing

661
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:29,519
um i i want to talk more about

662
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,640
uh specifically uh some questions around

663
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:32,798
mycorrhizae but

664
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,080
i'm worried the people listening to the

665
00:26:32,798 --> 00:26:37,519
podcast

666
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:40,480
may uh may not really understand

667
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:41,918
that when when you're talking about endo

668
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,360
and ectomycorrhiza

669
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:45,759
in relation to plants you're talking

670
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:49,199
about um

671
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:52,158
essentially a family of of organisms um

672
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:54,240
it's not once particular species here so

673
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:56,720
i want to just kind of highlight this so

674
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,759
in terms of in terms of let's say a

675
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:02,200
tomato crop

676
00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:04,798
or a cannabis crop that has a specific

677
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:07,120
endomycorrhizal relationship

678
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:08,639
not an ecto mycorrhizal relationship

679
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:09,119
because i see a lot of these products

680
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,799
out there

681
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:12,798
uh here in the united states that'll

682
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:13,278
have and i pulled one up to give you an

683
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:16,400
example

684
00:27:13,278 --> 00:27:20,038
it may have 83 propagules per gram of

685
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:21,200
uh an endomycorrhizal species and then

686
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:23,319
187

687
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,278
000 propables per gram of an

688
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:26,879
ectomycorrhizal species and you know

689
00:27:25,278 --> 00:27:27,759
that creates a total number that's much

690
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,240
higher

691
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:32,640
but that ectomycorrhizal doesn't have a

692
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,240
relationship with our

693
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,000
without with our cannabis crop or our

694
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,640
vegetable crop is that is that correct

695
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,119
are there any

696
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:41,759
other associated benefits to having

697
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:44,158
these high levels of ectomycorrhizal in

698
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:46,480
the mix

699
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:47,600
from uh mike first of all you're right

700
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,720
and from my

701
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:52,119
own experience uh i don't

702
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,240
have a reason to believe that

703
00:27:52,119 --> 00:27:59,678
ectomycorrhizal fungi

704
00:27:54,240 --> 00:28:02,720
do have a significant effect

705
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:04,798
in cannabis but i never tried uh myself

706
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:07,919
but the only the only thing that i can

707
00:28:04,798 --> 00:28:09,679
tell you when i should start it from uh

708
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:12,159
another thing that probably your

709
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:15,919
audience will be uh astonished to

710
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:17,039
to learn that about 85 percent of the

711
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:19,200
plant kingdom

712
00:28:17,038 --> 00:28:20,558
is being colonized with endomycorrhizal

713
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,480
fungi and here i'm referring to

714
00:28:20,558 --> 00:28:25,519
endomycorrhizal fungi

715
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:27,880
and uh in order to raise

716
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:29,038
uh uh these fungi the

717
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:33,120
endomycorrhizophilia

718
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:37,079
do need a plant which is alive

719
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:39,519
and uh and we are lucky for the

720
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:41,439
ectomycorrhizal fungi remember those

721
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:43,119
creatures which are not penetrating to

722
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:46,480
the plant roots

723
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:49,759
for them we are lucky to have

724
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:52,720
a laboratory technology

725
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:53,759
that can allow us to grow the

726
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,919
mycorrhizae

727
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:57,038
in laboratory condition and you don't

728
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:58,159
need the plant

729
00:28:57,038 --> 00:29:00,240
and you don't need the whole

730
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:02,159
relationship and to maintain this

731
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:05,159
relationship

732
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:07,159
so it's much easier to raise the

733
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:11,039
ectomycorrhiza until

734
00:29:07,159 --> 00:29:14,159
biotechnological equi you know

735
00:29:11,038 --> 00:29:16,640
means uh laboratory and uh

736
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:17,919
it's very tough to have the to grow the

737
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,640
the endomycorrhiza

738
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:21,278
not many labs can do it that's why uh

739
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,480
you'll find

740
00:29:21,278 --> 00:29:26,000
less uh proper goods or less spores of

741
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:29,599
endomycorrhiza

742
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:32,159
in those products and well that's our

743
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:33,199
was our ultimate question in the

744
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:36,240
beginning

745
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:38,880
how because we we try to study this

746
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,759
association and we try to purchase some

747
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,640
inoculum

748
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:44,158
and we realized that we cannot find it

749
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:47,360
definitely not in israel

750
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:49,200
and the one which was on the market was

751
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:53,119
so expensive so that's why we

752
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:56,159
dive in in order to find a

753
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:59,599
way that will uh

754
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:04,159
be a practical way and will give us a

755
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:04,158
high uh number uh of

756
00:30:04,558 --> 00:30:11,119
infected uh infected uh

757
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:14,639
in the in the inoculum but you're right

758
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:18,319
in the sense that uh for tomato

759
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:21,559
i'm sure that ectomycorrhizae does have

760
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:24,720
for soy for corn

761
00:30:21,558 --> 00:30:26,398
ectomycorrhizal fungi do not have as far

762
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,960
as i know

763
00:30:26,398 --> 00:30:30,079
a significant effect on plant

764
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,360
development

765
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:36,558
while the endomycorrhiza those which

766
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:39,918
were penetrated to the root do have

767
00:30:36,558 --> 00:30:42,798
a a significant effect and

768
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:43,120
this effect can be created in a matter

769
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:46,480
of

770
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:48,879
days it's not months or seasons it's

771
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,159
it's a matter of days and it's a

772
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:53,039
significant uh

773
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:54,159
so so if a small uh uh endometrial

774
00:30:53,038 --> 00:30:57,679
proper goods you'll have

775
00:30:54,159 --> 00:31:01,679
you know uh uh spores or uh

776
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:05,120
or fun or other uh means of proper goods

777
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:07,679
then uh your inoculum uh will be better

778
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:10,398
as long as it's uh endometria it comes

779
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:13,278
from endomycorrhizal foundry

780
00:31:10,398 --> 00:31:15,599
so that was great so in terms of uh

781
00:31:13,278 --> 00:31:16,839
endomycorrhizal fungus there's a lot of

782
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:19,839
different

783
00:31:16,839 --> 00:31:19,839
species

784
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:25,519
yeah i didn't answer sorry about that uh

785
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,640
well

786
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:31,120
it's uh it's known i mean we had uh

787
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:33,360
a collection that we brought to our

788
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:35,278
institute from so many

789
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:36,639
places around the world and we had the

790
00:31:35,278 --> 00:31:40,319
collaboration with different

791
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:44,159
scientists around the world and we

792
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:47,519
we realized that some of those

793
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:49,679
strains are better on a given

794
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:50,640
plant species and they are not that

795
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:52,640
efficient

796
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,320
when you go to another plant fish a

797
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:57,600
plant species

798
00:31:54,319 --> 00:32:00,960
and so we had to find the right blend

799
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:04,798
uh to a given plant species uh

800
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:07,278
in order to uh to maximize the effects

801
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:08,000
i'll give you uh two two examples one of

802
00:32:07,278 --> 00:32:10,079
them

803
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,159
is a fungus that we brought over from

804
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:15,519
the fast far east

805
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:19,600
and that fungus was a fungi

806
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:22,798
fungus was able uh to be very effective

807
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:27,119
uh uh under low ph

808
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:29,599
uh uh uh uh more acidity conditions

809
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:30,158
of the rhizosphere because we had in

810
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:33,678
israel

811
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:34,720
uh a lot of uh basic soils and we were

812
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:38,960
able to isaiah i

813
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:41,440
i isolate some local species here

814
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,558
and although all of them were adapted to

815
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:45,759
high ph

816
00:32:42,558 --> 00:32:48,158
so you know if you really want uh

817
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:50,720
uh to create a good product you should

818
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:53,519
try to have kind of a blend which will

819
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,798
create i mean you have two two options

820
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:58,159
one of them

821
00:32:54,798 --> 00:33:01,759
is uh to get uh to get

822
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:04,799
a super uh strain a superstar

823
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:05,839
that will work uh effectively under

824
00:33:04,798 --> 00:33:08,960
different uh

825
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:12,158
conditions or you can go ahead

826
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,880
and have multiple strengths each of each

827
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:15,919
of which

828
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:18,799
uh will have some beneficial uh

829
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:19,278
characteristic i think even like drought

830
00:33:18,798 --> 00:33:22,879
or

831
00:33:19,278 --> 00:33:24,640
or or or flooding uh you know some of

832
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,440
the strains which we are isolating the

833
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,600
desert

834
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:29,120
when you are going to expose uh those

835
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:31,038
training to flooding

836
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:32,639
and they will not be uh they will not

837
00:33:31,038 --> 00:33:34,798
make it which means uh

838
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:37,278
the strange that we were able to isolate

839
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:40,558
let's say in the israelis desert

840
00:33:37,278 --> 00:33:44,079
will never make it uh with rice

841
00:33:40,558 --> 00:33:47,440
in uh you know in those uh

842
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:50,879
pounds of you know high

843
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,278
level of water above the roots and

844
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,159
that's

845
00:33:51,278 --> 00:33:55,119
uh i think two examples which show you

846
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:57,200
uh that there are

847
00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:58,158
uh different species and and now the

848
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,798
industry

849
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:02,799
they are you know they have a wide range

850
00:34:00,798 --> 00:34:03,519
of different uh species and they can

851
00:34:02,798 --> 00:34:06,798
find

852
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:09,918
uh the right strains or

853
00:34:06,798 --> 00:34:12,719
the super strain and the super strength

854
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:14,078
sometimes is better it's easier to

855
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:17,279
produce

856
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:20,480
you don't need to bring along the ecto

857
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:23,760
mycorrhizae accounts for your product

858
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:26,079
you can depend uh solely on uh

859
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:28,240
on the endomycorrhiza and that's

860
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:31,679
something which is appreciated uh

861
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:34,078
uh uh by by the growers uh

862
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,358
it's uh the price coming to the price

863
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:37,679
which is manageable

864
00:34:35,358 --> 00:34:39,838
uh if you need to raise let's say three

865
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:42,159
or four strains of uh

866
00:34:39,838 --> 00:34:43,759
different uh you know for your blank

867
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:46,878
different species

868
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:49,119
of course it's double or tripled the

869
00:34:46,878 --> 00:34:51,838
cost of of the product

870
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:52,559
uh while when you have in hand super

871
00:34:51,838 --> 00:34:56,078
strain

872
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:59,039
and then it it would be much easier

873
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:59,280
uh to produce and to provide to provide

874
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:02,880
it

875
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:06,000
to to the growers in a fur price or

876
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,559
cost so essentially this this super

877
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,079
strain

878
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:13,199
will work over a greater range of ph uh

879
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:15,440
greater range of water moisture content

880
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:18,559
and soils

881
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:21,920
have a just a more persistent

882
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:24,480
ability to infect the plant um

883
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,960
that makes a lot of sense now the one

884
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,039
that's

885
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,480
the most popular out there that i've

886
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:30,800
seen is glomus

887
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:33,679
interaces i believe it's referred to now

888
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:36,160
as rhizophagus irregularis

889
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:38,799
uh in terms of like nomenclature it's

890
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:42,799
hard when scientists change names on us

891
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:44,480
but is this particular strain going to

892
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:47,680
be the same if it was produced

893
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:48,800
say at a lab in canada per as compared

894
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:52,319
to the your lab

895
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:54,960
say in israel uh

896
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:57,039
well although both of us are using

897
00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:00,720
glamos enterolysis

898
00:35:57,039 --> 00:36:04,000
i will use the old normal culture uh

899
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:06,000
uh we have different strains uh we have

900
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,400
different strains uh

901
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,358
the one which we isolate here are coming

902
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,160
from uh

903
00:36:09,358 --> 00:36:13,358
you know from the desert high

904
00:36:12,159 --> 00:36:16,159
temperature

905
00:36:13,358 --> 00:36:17,440
uh low humidity i mean these are

906
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:21,039
superstars where

907
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:24,240
which were able to make it along the

908
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:28,000
evolution uh so and we

909
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:32,239
are very uh persist in in a way

910
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:34,719
uh to take to take uh those strains uh

911
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:36,639
over the the way that you know the ray

912
00:36:34,719 --> 00:36:37,118
the way that we are producing it to take

913
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:40,400
them

914
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:44,160
through uh very difficult times so

915
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:47,200
it help us later on to maintain

916
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:49,039
uh the vigors of of our strengths

917
00:36:47,199 --> 00:36:51,118
and the ones which are being produced

918
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:52,079
under tissue culture condition i mean

919
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:55,920
they are

920
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:58,640
very they are uh in terms of uh

921
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:00,960
they are they are producing a lot of

922
00:36:58,639 --> 00:37:04,000
spores per unit of time

923
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:08,000
and i mean it's like um you know

924
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:10,320
we know it uh they got used to that

925
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,760
environmental condition that everything

926
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,660
is being provided

927
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,680
in optimum and

928
00:37:13,659 --> 00:37:19,118
[Music]

929
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:22,159
as long as you don't uh tip the

930
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:22,880
the con the growth condition which is a

931
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:26,000
little bit

932
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:28,240
i mean more tougher uh then you probably

933
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,320
can get the benefit out of it but in

934
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:32,239
some cases you know and it's happening

935
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:35,039
uh to all of us

936
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:36,719
uh irrigation schedule is a little bit

937
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:40,079
changed there is a

938
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:42,639
kind of pumps in our

939
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:43,519
cultivations and you really want

940
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:47,199
something that

941
00:37:43,519 --> 00:37:50,719
will be able to uh overcome those bumps

942
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:54,480
something that can iron those wrinkles

943
00:37:50,719 --> 00:37:57,759
in in the groin care if you want

944
00:37:54,480 --> 00:38:01,119
and that's why we decided to stay

945
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:04,160
uh with this uh more vigor

946
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:05,760
strain so

947
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:07,358
uh what you're saying are these strains

948
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:10,079
are not necessarily the same

949
00:38:07,358 --> 00:38:10,719
and uh some of these tissue culture

950
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:13,359
strains

951
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:14,559
uh essentially grew up in environments

952
00:38:13,358 --> 00:38:17,679
that are

953
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:19,920
are essentially ideal for them and so

954
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:23,039
when they get put in a situation that's

955
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:24,880
less than ideal say in a grower's

956
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:26,800
soil where you might have more

957
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,800
fluctuations in temperature

958
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,480
water conditions and things they may not

959
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,880
be as vigorous

960
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:35,199
as something that was more adapted to

961
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:38,480
those conditions

962
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:40,319
yes exactly what i meant okay i just

963
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:42,559
no i just wanna i just wanna clarify and

964
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:44,800
make sure i'm understanding too so

965
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:46,239
uh you know i wanna talk a little bit

966
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:49,280
about the

967
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:50,000
persistence in soils but before we do

968
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,720
can you

969
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,239
uh clarify some things because i know

970
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:55,838
some listeners uh

971
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:57,439
i saw a picture the other day of some

972
00:38:55,838 --> 00:38:59,039
really healthy root hairs

973
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:01,440
online and they were claiming that this

974
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:03,599
was a mycorrhizae

975
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:05,760
and you know it was a vegetable root so

976
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:08,400
i knew that it was an endomycorrhizal

977
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:10,560
uh plant that they were they were

978
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,240
showing photos of the roots of now my

979
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:14,559
understanding is you actually have to

980
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:16,159
stain the roots and you know looking

981
00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:18,239
through a you know 80 times

982
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:20,159
magnification like a jeweler's loop is

983
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:20,559
not going to allow you to see if your

984
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:25,199
plant

985
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:28,159
actually has that association

986
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:29,199
what how can a grower determine if if

987
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:34,159
their plant has

988
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:38,078
mycorrhizal infection or can they really

989
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:38,078
uh i'm very

990
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,160
pessimistic you know first of all under

991
00:39:41,358 --> 00:39:43,679
lab condition

992
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:45,838
it's very easy to see the microarray you

993
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:47,199
have to stain it so we we are using a

994
00:39:45,838 --> 00:39:50,639
specific uh

995
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:53,838
uh dyes which are uh which are

996
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:54,879
bound to to the hyphae uh of the of the

997
00:39:53,838 --> 00:39:57,199
fungus and

998
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,000
uh they cannot be bound to the root

999
00:39:57,199 --> 00:40:00,239
itself so

1000
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
uh in a way you can see the hyphy very

1001
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:05,759
clearly if you don't stain

1002
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:08,000
stain the roots you cannot see uh

1003
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:10,160
you cannot see the mycorrhizae perfect

1004
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:14,159
that answers the question

1005
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:17,118
yeah yeah that's very clear uh you know

1006
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:18,000
just looking at the root hairs uh will

1007
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:21,680
not tell you

1008
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:24,400
much now uh if you have uh

1009
00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:25,679
nowadays you know scientists actually uh

1010
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,800
they learn more and more

1011
00:40:25,679 --> 00:40:31,519
now uh there is uh specific molecules

1012
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:33,119
which is being accumulated in the leaf

1013
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:34,880
and when you have my

1014
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:36,160
mycorrhizae if you have colonization

1015
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:39,358
down in the roots

1016
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:40,639
uh that molecule is accumulated in the

1017
00:40:39,358 --> 00:40:44,000
leaf up there

1018
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:47,118
but it's uh really required uh

1019
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:50,079
more complicated and sophisticated uh

1020
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:51,200
chemical analysis and machinery uh so

1021
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:54,800
unfortunately

1022
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:56,960
uh not now but i'm i hope that

1023
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,920
we'll have uh in the future also some

1024
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:01,119
kind of a kit

1025
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:03,440
that will tell us exactly

1026
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:04,400
you know you can take the you can squash

1027
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:08,000
your leaves

1028
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:11,519
in uh against uh you know a small uh

1029
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:14,960
plastic and then uh

1030
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:16,639
drop have couple of drops in and it will

1031
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,079
change the color and will tell you if

1032
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:21,838
it's microwaving or not

1033
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:23,920
unfortunately it's still a dream uh

1034
00:41:21,838 --> 00:41:27,119
well some people are working on it but

1035
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:28,960
it's still far from uh form application

1036
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:31,039
sure that's that's really interesting

1037
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:33,440
thank you for clarifying that

1038
00:41:31,039 --> 00:41:35,358
uh so you mentioned that the infection

1039
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:38,000
takes a period of days

1040
00:41:35,358 --> 00:41:39,440
what's sort of that range of time and

1041
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,960
along those lines

1042
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:46,159
uh are we really seeing results in a

1043
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:48,880
in a you know fairly quick crop like

1044
00:41:46,159 --> 00:41:49,279
let's just say lettuce versus cannabis

1045
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,240
um

1046
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:53,599
can you is there any real benefit to to

1047
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:57,439
a mycorrhizal infection

1048
00:41:53,599 --> 00:42:00,640
in some of these faster crops

1049
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:04,079
uh definitely yes

1050
00:42:00,639 --> 00:42:05,759
if you have a spore let's say well

1051
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:07,280
there are a couple of ways to get the

1052
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:10,480
mycorrhizae into your

1053
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:12,079
uh root system one way is to have a

1054
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:15,599
spore which is a

1055
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:18,400
uh uh the

1056
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:19,039
it's a kind it's like a seed in terms of

1057
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:22,559
uh i mean

1058
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:24,480
uh it's uh not a living organism as long

1059
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:25,440
i mean it's a living organism but it's

1060
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,719
in a dormant

1061
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:32,318
dormant stage it takes about

1062
00:42:28,719 --> 00:42:35,519
uh five days from the moment

1063
00:42:32,318 --> 00:42:36,480
that you expose that sport to the

1064
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:39,838
rhizosphere

1065
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:41,199
please listen very carefully it's not

1066
00:42:39,838 --> 00:42:44,480
from the moment that you

1067
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:45,838
wet the spore when you expose the root

1068
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:49,760
to the rhizosphere

1069
00:42:45,838 --> 00:42:52,960
and the uh the the spore is

1070
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:53,440
being exposed to a molecules which allow

1071
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,240
it

1072
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:57,440
to break which allowed to break the

1073
00:42:56,239 --> 00:43:01,118
dormancy

1074
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:05,358
and hyphy

1075
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:08,640
is emerge is emerging from the spore

1076
00:43:05,358 --> 00:43:12,159
and you can say see penetration to a

1077
00:43:08,639 --> 00:43:15,199
tissue to the roots again

1078
00:43:12,159 --> 00:43:15,519
not to every part of the route only at

1079
00:43:15,199 --> 00:43:17,358
the

1080
00:43:15,519 --> 00:43:18,559
young stages of the route at the root

1081
00:43:17,358 --> 00:43:21,838
tip

1082
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:23,838
at around five days if you

1083
00:43:21,838 --> 00:43:26,159
you can you know you can see

1084
00:43:23,838 --> 00:43:27,279
colonization at the more mature part of

1085
00:43:26,159 --> 00:43:30,078
the roots after

1086
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:31,680
let's say seven two weeks or something

1087
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:34,240
like this but definitely

1088
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:34,719
the mycorrhizae can colonize the plant

1089
00:43:34,239 --> 00:43:38,318
and

1090
00:43:34,719 --> 00:43:41,519
can understand can be established

1091
00:43:38,318 --> 00:43:42,318
in a matter of of days or we can say

1092
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:45,039
after

1093
00:43:42,318 --> 00:43:46,159
you know like three weeks uh you you

1094
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:48,159
should start

1095
00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:50,000
uh i mean if you have the right

1096
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:53,199
condition uh

1097
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,679
uh you can start seeing some

1098
00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:57,759
differences uh between mycorrhitic and

1099
00:43:55,679 --> 00:44:00,480
not microtic plant

1100
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:02,240
and that's well it really depends on the

1101
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:05,599
growth condition of the plant

1102
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:07,838
when the plant is more stressed then the

1103
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:08,720
effect of the mycorrhizae is more

1104
00:44:07,838 --> 00:44:11,679
obvious i mean

1105
00:44:08,719 --> 00:44:13,358
it can be distinguished very easily but

1106
00:44:11,679 --> 00:44:16,480
we don't want to get to

1107
00:44:13,358 --> 00:44:19,598
such a stress condition in our

1108
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:21,838
crops in agriculture so uh that's why

1109
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:23,200
uh it will take a little bit more but

1110
00:44:21,838 --> 00:44:25,759
it's in a matter of

1111
00:44:23,199 --> 00:44:27,039
you know four to five weeks and

1112
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:30,079
definitely you can

1113
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:33,199
see uh some changes uh

1114
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:36,240
definitely when you if you if you do

1115
00:44:33,199 --> 00:44:39,679
uh tissue analysis and you look for

1116
00:44:36,239 --> 00:44:43,279
phosphorus and iron you'll see

1117
00:44:39,679 --> 00:44:45,919
manganese you'll see high concentration

1118
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,640
of those elements in the in the plant

1119
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:50,000
itself

1120
00:44:46,639 --> 00:44:52,639
and it will start affecting uh

1121
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,000
now the question is how bad the

1122
00:44:52,639 --> 00:44:57,440
environmental condition is

1123
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,838
i mean if your plant again is a very

1124
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:01,679
optimal condition nothing is missing

1125
00:44:59,838 --> 00:45:02,559
there you have the right wavelength

1126
00:45:01,679 --> 00:45:05,759
there are

1127
00:45:02,559 --> 00:45:06,960
the right humidity irrigation is perfect

1128
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:10,880
irrigation

1129
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:13,280
aeration in the soil is perfect then uh

1130
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,318
you might not see even the effect of of

1131
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:18,400
mycorrhizal because

1132
00:45:14,318 --> 00:45:21,679
everything is perfect you have to uh

1133
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:24,160
bear in mind that uh that uh

1134
00:45:21,679 --> 00:45:25,598
relationship with the fungus is costly

1135
00:45:24,159 --> 00:45:28,879
because the plant need to

1136
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:31,280
invest and actually to put aside

1137
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:32,160
a lot some of the of the photosynthetic

1138
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:34,480
which is

1139
00:45:32,159 --> 00:45:36,480
being accumulated in the plant now if

1140
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,440
the plant is not suffering and you have

1141
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:40,240
everything so

1142
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:40,880
why to invest in something that we will

1143
00:45:40,239 --> 00:45:44,719
not

1144
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:45,440
do any different uh for many many crops

1145
00:45:44,719 --> 00:45:48,639
we say

1146
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:51,039
that it's like an insurance policy you

1147
00:45:48,639 --> 00:45:52,480
put it in this mycorrhizae just in case

1148
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:55,239
if something will happen

1149
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:56,400
if something will break if something

1150
00:45:55,239 --> 00:45:58,879
unexpectedly

1151
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:00,800
will appear there and then you have the

1152
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:03,760
microvisor to help you out

1153
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:05,440
in in that stress and that and you know

1154
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:09,359
i i can even use the same

1155
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:11,519
uh uh the same saying again

1156
00:46:09,358 --> 00:46:12,880
if you have a wrinkle in your pro or

1157
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:15,679
groin protocol

1158
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:16,400
uh the mycorrhizae can iron it and it

1159
00:46:15,679 --> 00:46:19,759
will not be

1160
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:21,680
that uh to deter the net

1161
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:23,200
it doesn't stick it to the plant and the

1162
00:46:21,679 --> 00:46:26,719
plant will not suffer

1163
00:46:23,199 --> 00:46:28,559
so much from that mistake or that

1164
00:46:26,719 --> 00:46:30,000
change in the environment or that

1165
00:46:28,559 --> 00:46:33,039
unexpected uh

1166
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:36,880
situation so uh in a way

1167
00:46:33,039 --> 00:46:39,358
uh mycorrhizae

1168
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:40,240
sometimes if you have excellent goals

1169
00:46:39,358 --> 00:46:42,078
condition

1170
00:46:40,239 --> 00:46:43,598
it will be very hard to see the

1171
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:47,760
difference uh

1172
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:50,880
but you know that always uh

1173
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:52,630
there are some uh uh you know

1174
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:54,800
time points uh that

1175
00:46:52,630 --> 00:46:56,318
[Music]

1176
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:57,839
we don't know but something is being

1177
00:46:56,318 --> 00:47:00,800
created there that

1178
00:46:57,838 --> 00:47:01,599
uh or some regions uh uh uh along the

1179
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:04,560
routes

1180
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:06,559
uh i mean you have uh irrigation in the

1181
00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:09,920
top of your soil

1182
00:47:06,559 --> 00:47:13,039
uh and down there the roots

1183
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:16,480
can be exposed to uh you know

1184
00:47:13,039 --> 00:47:19,519
to to drought not only that but uh

1185
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:20,159
you have uh probably overweighting and

1186
00:47:19,519 --> 00:47:23,759
you ever

1187
00:47:20,159 --> 00:47:25,519
saw your water being exposed to anoxia

1188
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:28,240
and not enough oxygen

1189
00:47:25,519 --> 00:47:28,880
again mycorrhizae can help you out and

1190
00:47:28,239 --> 00:47:32,318
that's

1191
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:36,160
the benefit of having mycorrhizae

1192
00:47:32,318 --> 00:47:38,719
in your crop well i think in reality

1193
00:47:36,159 --> 00:47:40,000
you know in the real world in normal

1194
00:47:38,719 --> 00:47:41,519
growing conditions

1195
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,199
even with controlled environment

1196
00:47:41,519 --> 00:47:46,318
agriculture there still

1197
00:47:43,199 --> 00:47:47,118
are a lot of plant stresses we no one is

1198
00:47:46,318 --> 00:47:50,480
growing in

1199
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:52,318
a perfect optimal plant conditions

1200
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:53,920
for the entire growth cycle at least

1201
00:47:52,318 --> 00:47:57,519
none that i've ever seen

1202
00:47:53,920 --> 00:48:00,000
um so this this makes a lot of sense um

1203
00:47:57,519 --> 00:48:01,920
for them to form this relationship but

1204
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:05,280
one of the things you touched on here

1205
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:07,838
was that if the plant has

1206
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:10,079
perfect conditions it's not going to

1207
00:48:07,838 --> 00:48:12,078
form this relationship i've heard that

1208
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:13,359
in association with high phosphorus

1209
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:15,200
because the plant says

1210
00:48:13,358 --> 00:48:17,119
i'm getting all the phosphorus i need

1211
00:48:15,199 --> 00:48:19,118
it's already plant available

1212
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:21,760
i'm not going to bother with the

1213
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:24,960
spikeorizal association

1214
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:27,680
even though there's other benefits to

1215
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:28,318
the the mycorrhizal infection like you

1216
00:48:27,679 --> 00:48:31,358
just

1217
00:48:28,318 --> 00:48:32,800
you just stated so what are some of the

1218
00:48:31,358 --> 00:48:37,119
best practices

1219
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:38,240
for using mycorrhizae endomycorrhiza

1220
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:40,240
it sounds like it needs to come in

1221
00:48:38,239 --> 00:48:42,318
direct contact with the roots

1222
00:48:40,239 --> 00:48:43,679
it can be directly in the rhizosphere

1223
00:48:42,318 --> 00:48:45,440
itself

1224
00:48:43,679 --> 00:48:48,159
we want to apply it early on in the

1225
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:50,880
plant's life i would think a transplant

1226
00:48:48,159 --> 00:48:51,279
what what what do you see avoiding high

1227
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:53,358
p

1228
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:54,559
was the other one that uh i want to

1229
00:48:53,358 --> 00:48:55,838
mention um

1230
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:57,599
what are what are some of your ben your

1231
00:48:55,838 --> 00:49:00,000
recommendations

1232
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:02,000
all right from my own experience uh as

1233
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,880
soon as you apply the mycorrhizae is

1234
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,079
better

1235
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:08,240
if you really want to reach those roots

1236
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:09,200
the young part of the roots which are

1237
00:49:08,239 --> 00:49:11,358
actually the

1238
00:49:09,199 --> 00:49:11,358
uh

1239
00:49:12,719 --> 00:49:19,598
those are the best location to colonize

1240
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:21,838
uh you should have the mycorrhizae

1241
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:22,800
at a close facility to to those

1242
00:49:21,838 --> 00:49:25,920
locations

1243
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:28,960
uh if you you know we tried a couple of

1244
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:32,240
years uh i could tell you a lot

1245
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:33,358
of stories but we we try to apply the

1246
00:49:32,239 --> 00:49:36,719
mycorrhizae

1247
00:49:33,358 --> 00:49:37,440
by drilling some holes to a more mature

1248
00:49:36,719 --> 00:49:39,358
plant

1249
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:41,679
and you have to imagine to yourself how

1250
00:49:39,358 --> 00:49:44,159
you know how much of the root surface

1251
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:45,759
really was able to enjoy the mycorrhizae

1252
00:49:44,159 --> 00:49:49,358
existence of mycorrhizae

1253
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:52,640
and that's created the situation that uh

1254
00:49:49,358 --> 00:49:56,000
uh the the volume of the root system

1255
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:59,039
which uh which mycorrhizae can

1256
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:01,760
have a contact with is is very small

1257
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:02,239
so you the benefit to the plant would be

1258
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:05,440
also

1259
00:50:02,239 --> 00:50:07,439
a smaller so

1260
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:09,200
well i i still remember i still remember

1261
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:12,159
that you know

1262
00:50:09,199 --> 00:50:14,000
having saying so i was involved in an

1263
00:50:12,159 --> 00:50:16,239
experiment at the queue garden

1264
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,519
in the cook garden in england there are

1265
00:50:16,239 --> 00:50:20,318
some plants

1266
00:50:17,519 --> 00:50:21,519
which you know very old plants and that

1267
00:50:20,318 --> 00:50:25,440
we try to

1268
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:26,000
uh help them uh be they were very old

1269
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,400
and

1270
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,440
they were not really in a bear really

1271
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:32,000
all plants were

1272
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:32,880
you know this is the right way to say

1273
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,039
and if you

1274
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:36,400
you really want to have my greater there

1275
00:50:35,039 --> 00:50:39,358
so what we have done

1276
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:40,079
we injected mycorrhizae around the trunk

1277
00:50:39,358 --> 00:50:42,719
uh

1278
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:45,119
trying to reach some of the roots and

1279
00:50:42,719 --> 00:50:47,838
allowing that old plant to enjoy

1280
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:48,400
better uh the ground conditions so you

1281
00:50:47,838 --> 00:50:51,759
know

1282
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:55,119
uh we tried also in israel in uh

1283
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:57,599
in uh in the cities uh

1284
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:59,119
some play you have some trees uh that

1285
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:01,760
are not actually receiving

1286
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:03,838
uh and the right conditions and are

1287
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:07,359
suffering from soil compaction

1288
00:51:03,838 --> 00:51:10,719
so we try to uh to inject mycorrhizae

1289
00:51:07,358 --> 00:51:11,519
but we saw some benefits after a while

1290
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:15,199
and that's the

1291
00:51:11,519 --> 00:51:17,679
type of experiment it takes uh even

1292
00:51:15,199 --> 00:51:20,239
half a year until you see something if

1293
00:51:17,679 --> 00:51:23,118
you really want to enjoy

1294
00:51:20,239 --> 00:51:24,318
mycorrhizae in the boeing season make

1295
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:27,838
sure that you have it

1296
00:51:24,318 --> 00:51:29,199
right there in the right position and

1297
00:51:27,838 --> 00:51:31,039
i know that there are some

1298
00:51:29,199 --> 00:51:34,399
recommendations uh

1299
00:51:31,039 --> 00:51:38,159
to put mycorrhizae on the soil surface

1300
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:41,920
so uh well i can tell you uh again

1301
00:51:38,159 --> 00:51:45,759
uh it will take ages to those uh

1302
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:48,240
uh uh uh uh infection units uh

1303
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:49,440
and mainly sports you know to a spa

1304
00:51:48,239 --> 00:51:52,879
which is which is a

1305
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:55,920
very it's a big structure to really

1306
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:58,559
to uh go through soil layer

1307
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:59,039
and to reach uh the root tip uh you know

1308
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:02,079
which is

1309
00:51:59,039 --> 00:52:05,039
sometimes 10 or 15 centimeters away

1310
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:06,559
is edges it's it's ages you'll not be

1311
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:07,440
able to make it in the same growing

1312
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:10,480
season

1313
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:14,000
so as soon as you have uh

1314
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:17,760
the mycorrhizae around the right

1315
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:20,239
region on the root then uh i'm sure

1316
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:22,000
you'll be able to colonize better the

1317
00:52:20,239 --> 00:52:25,598
entire root system

1318
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:28,400
and uh also uh you know maybe it's

1319
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:30,318
worth to mention something when the

1320
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:33,358
mycorrhizae is

1321
00:52:30,318 --> 00:52:37,039
penetrating the hifi is penetrating

1322
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:40,239
uh to the root tissue the next stage

1323
00:52:37,039 --> 00:52:43,599
or the next step for the mycorrhizae

1324
00:52:40,239 --> 00:52:46,000
is going and looking for

1325
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:47,599
something to eat uh to get more

1326
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,519
photosynthesis

1327
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:51,440
where you have more photosynthesis when

1328
00:52:49,519 --> 00:52:54,239
you're entering at a root tip

1329
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:56,079
i mean you have to migrate or to be

1330
00:52:54,239 --> 00:52:59,679
expanded or grow

1331
00:52:56,079 --> 00:53:02,720
upwards so uh that most of

1332
00:52:59,679 --> 00:53:04,558
the direction of the mycorrhizae is from

1333
00:53:02,719 --> 00:53:08,159
the root edge

1334
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:11,440
of the tip to uh the more mature

1335
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:14,480
uh towards the shoot okay so

1336
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:16,559
it's going upwards and not downward and

1337
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:17,519
if you have a mycorrhizae and you apply

1338
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:20,880
it on

1339
00:53:17,519 --> 00:53:24,559
the top it barely reach

1340
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:26,640
the root system and you'll be able uh uh

1341
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:28,720
you'll not be able to colonize the

1342
00:53:26,639 --> 00:53:30,078
entire root system and then you'll blame

1343
00:53:28,719 --> 00:53:31,519
the microarray that it's not working

1344
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:32,880
well it's not working because it's not

1345
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:35,358
being spread

1346
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:36,400
downwards it's being spread mostly

1347
00:53:35,358 --> 00:53:39,119
upwards

1348
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:39,760
so as soon as you put the mycorrhizae

1349
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:42,559
when

1350
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:43,599
you have almost most of the root system

1351
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:46,720
around it

1352
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:49,359
uh you can uh you can make sure

1353
00:53:46,719 --> 00:53:50,480
that more of your root system is being

1354
00:53:49,358 --> 00:53:53,519
will be colonized

1355
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:54,960
by the fungus that's great that's great

1356
00:53:53,519 --> 00:53:57,679
because you see these uh

1357
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:59,519
you know micronized products mycorrhizal

1358
00:53:57,679 --> 00:54:00,879
products here in the united states

1359
00:53:59,519 --> 00:54:03,119
and really they're not you can't

1360
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:04,240
micronize a spore you're micronizing the

1361
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:08,318
carrier

1362
00:54:04,239 --> 00:54:10,000
for the the mycorrhizae and uh even then

1363
00:54:08,318 --> 00:54:11,759
like you mentioned trying to get it to

1364
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,838
work its way all the way down to the

1365
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:14,400
roots is going to take a long long time

1366
00:54:13,838 --> 00:54:17,599
if it can

1367
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:19,358
even makes it so i

1368
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:20,640
i would just recommend the listeners

1369
00:54:19,358 --> 00:54:23,119
that you follow this advice

1370
00:54:20,639 --> 00:54:24,000
and apply it directly to the root zone

1371
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:26,800
if you have the ability

1372
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:28,719
to do that with a plant so that's that's

1373
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:31,039
great

1374
00:54:28,719 --> 00:54:31,919
one other question i had around this

1375
00:54:31,039 --> 00:54:34,400
this

1376
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:36,000
idea of application is i see a lot of

1377
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:39,200
products that have

1378
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,838
trichoderma and mycorrhizae in them i've

1379
00:54:39,199 --> 00:54:42,480
heard

1380
00:54:39,838 --> 00:54:44,159
from some scientists that this is a

1381
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:47,440
symbiotic relationship

1382
00:54:44,159 --> 00:54:47,759
um i've heard from others that due to

1383
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:50,798
the

1384
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:53,200
aggressive nature of trichoderma some of

1385
00:54:50,798 --> 00:54:55,599
the speculation is that

1386
00:54:53,199 --> 00:54:57,039
the trichoderma is is the benefit that a

1387
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:59,200
lot of these people are seeing and not

1388
00:54:57,039 --> 00:55:02,000
necessarily mycorrhizal

1389
00:54:59,199 --> 00:55:03,519
um because the other issue there too is

1390
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,679
the relationship will be like

1391
00:55:03,519 --> 00:55:06,719
a thousand to one in terms of

1392
00:55:05,679 --> 00:55:11,440
trichoderma

1393
00:55:06,719 --> 00:55:11,439
to mycorrhizal spores

1394
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:16,880
what are your thoughts in regards to

1395
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:19,599
trichoderma and mycorrhizae

1396
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:21,039
well in our hand we tried it because the

1397
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:24,400
trichoderma

1398
00:55:21,039 --> 00:55:25,119
was or enter uh to the practice to the

1399
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,880
nursery

1400
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:28,240
practice before my horizon here in

1401
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:31,280
israel so

1402
00:55:28,239 --> 00:55:32,239
uh we had to do to show compatibility to

1403
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:35,119
see

1404
00:55:32,239 --> 00:55:36,159
uh if uh you know uh what's really

1405
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:39,838
happening there

1406
00:55:36,159 --> 00:55:43,279
uh and uh maybe the trichoderma would uh

1407
00:55:39,838 --> 00:55:45,838
somehow uh uh

1408
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:46,640
eliminating uh the democratization of

1409
00:55:45,838 --> 00:55:50,318
the roots

1410
00:55:46,639 --> 00:55:54,719
and in our hands we could see

1411
00:55:50,318 --> 00:55:57,759
them living side by side

1412
00:55:54,719 --> 00:56:02,239
with no significant reduction of

1413
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:04,960
in my horizon when you have a full uh

1414
00:56:02,239 --> 00:56:06,000
trichoderma treatment uh the recommended

1415
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:09,679
treatment

1416
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:11,760
uh i'm not i'm not you know i don't have

1417
00:56:09,679 --> 00:56:14,480
any experience with

1418
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:15,839
those uh products that are being sold in

1419
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:18,240
the u.s

1420
00:56:15,838 --> 00:56:19,838
but uh the mycorrhizae that the

1421
00:56:18,239 --> 00:56:20,719
tricodema which is being sold here in

1422
00:56:19,838 --> 00:56:24,239
israel

1423
00:56:20,719 --> 00:56:27,439
uh i'm sure that uh it's not harming

1424
00:56:24,239 --> 00:56:30,879
uh the the mycorrhizae

1425
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:34,079
so that's my my own experience

1426
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:34,400
and uh you know if you are using uh in a

1427
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:37,039
way

1428
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:38,000
those strains that are being uh right

1429
00:56:37,039 --> 00:56:41,119
now use

1430
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,400
are being used by groundwork uh some of

1431
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:45,599
those trends uh

1432
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:48,798
came from our collections uh

1433
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:52,640
they they you know they can uh they can

1434
00:56:48,798 --> 00:56:56,719
survive uh with a co-inoculation

1435
00:56:52,639 --> 00:56:58,078
with no much of uh effect

1436
00:56:56,719 --> 00:57:01,118
that's that's wonderful that's really

1437
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:05,119
good to hear um

1438
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:08,240
how long does mycorrhizal fungus persist

1439
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:11,599
in in potting soil so if we were reusing

1440
00:57:08,239 --> 00:57:13,439
uh our potting soil i assumed that there

1441
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:15,359
would be

1442
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:17,760
potentially some propagules in there

1443
00:57:15,358 --> 00:57:20,798
hyphal fragments spores

1444
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:24,160
do we need to be reapplying

1445
00:57:20,798 --> 00:57:24,719
mycorrhizal fungus every you know every

1446
00:57:24,159 --> 00:57:27,838
cycle

1447
00:57:24,719 --> 00:57:27,838
in situations like that

1448
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:33,838
uh if you have a good population in your

1449
00:57:32,239 --> 00:57:36,639
soil

1450
00:57:33,838 --> 00:57:38,639
and it's not just to have them you you

1451
00:57:36,639 --> 00:57:42,239
need you have the right strain

1452
00:57:38,639 --> 00:57:45,679
in the right concentration probably

1453
00:57:42,239 --> 00:57:48,879
you may not need to add more uh

1454
00:57:45,679 --> 00:57:52,000
mycorrhizae however uh

1455
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:53,440
you know that's not always uh because

1456
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,599
you know sometimes you check for

1457
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:56,159
mycorrhizae in your soil and then your

1458
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:59,519
that

1459
00:57:56,159 --> 00:58:02,000
soil would go to the warehouse and will

1460
00:57:59,519 --> 00:58:03,039
stay there for a while and you have to

1461
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,039
remember

1462
00:58:03,039 --> 00:58:06,079
that in order to maintain mycorrhizae

1463
00:58:05,039 --> 00:58:09,279
you need the living

1464
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:12,798
tissue you need the roots so if uh

1465
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:15,440
there is no uh growing roots there uh

1466
00:58:12,798 --> 00:58:16,318
some of these population will be

1467
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:18,159
affected

1468
00:58:16,318 --> 00:58:20,719
of of the micros so that's something

1469
00:58:18,159 --> 00:58:22,558
which you need to make sure

1470
00:58:20,719 --> 00:58:23,838
that everything is fresh and everything

1471
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:26,960
is alive

1472
00:58:23,838 --> 00:58:31,039
um so

1473
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:34,079
but you usually i i never trust

1474
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:37,440
the the potting mix

1475
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:40,480
to be the soil the sole

1476
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:43,599
source of mycorrhizal of our studies

1477
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:44,880
we usually applied fresh inoculum every

1478
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:48,798
cycle

1479
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:51,280
and when you start it at early stages

1480
00:58:48,798 --> 00:58:52,400
the amount that is being needed for

1481
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:55,920
application

1482
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:59,119
is uh is is small uh so it's really

1483
00:58:55,920 --> 00:59:02,559
uh uh doesn't it it's

1484
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:04,240
really the uh doesn't worth the

1485
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:06,559
taking the chances you know what they

1486
00:59:04,239 --> 00:59:08,959
mean yeah it's it's absolutely

1487
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:10,000
cost effective to apply it early in the

1488
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:11,280
plant's life

1489
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,519
because you don't need very much and the

1490
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:14,960
biomass is going to grow along with the

1491
00:59:13,519 --> 00:59:17,679
root biomass

1492
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:18,159
exactly so that makes a ton of sense uh

1493
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:20,798
and

1494
00:59:18,159 --> 00:59:22,558
and one thing i also see with labels is

1495
00:59:20,798 --> 00:59:24,719
people will buy potting soil that will

1496
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:27,599
list mycorrhizae on the label but

1497
00:59:24,719 --> 00:59:28,558
in reality the amount that's in there is

1498
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:31,359
so

1499
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:33,599
minuscule and small that they probably

1500
00:59:31,358 --> 00:59:37,358
won't get infection

1501
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:41,119
or if they do it will take way too long

1502
00:59:37,358 --> 00:59:44,239
but what what i'm relating it to is

1503
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:45,440
for people who do let's say you know

1504
00:59:44,239 --> 00:59:48,078
some of these facilities that are

1505
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:51,119
growing cannabis in a raised bed

1506
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:53,599
will inoculate

1507
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:55,358
their plants in that bed the plant will

1508
00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:58,240
flower out in the bed

1509
00:59:55,358 --> 00:59:58,880
and then they will pull the plant and

1510
00:59:58,239 --> 01:00:00,879
leave

1511
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:02,079
root fragments in the soil and then

1512
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:04,318
plant

1513
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:06,160
uh another plant back into that bed

1514
01:00:04,318 --> 01:00:09,199
another cannabis plant within you know

1515
01:00:06,159 --> 01:00:11,759
24 to 36 hours and i'm wondering if

1516
01:00:09,199 --> 01:00:13,519
you know doing this five times a year

1517
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:15,200
over the course of multiple years

1518
01:00:13,519 --> 01:00:17,920
if at some point there would be enough

1519
01:00:15,199 --> 01:00:17,919
mycorrhizal

1520
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:22,079
you know hyphae or propagules that you

1521
01:00:20,798 --> 01:00:25,280
wouldn't necessarily

1522
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:26,400
see a big difference in benefit in

1523
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:29,119
regards to

1524
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:30,639
direct application every time if you

1525
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:31,838
have the yeah if you have the right

1526
01:00:30,639 --> 01:00:35,118
strength as i mentioned

1527
01:00:31,838 --> 01:00:38,639
uh before and uh

1528
01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:41,358
probably uh you you you reach a level

1529
01:00:38,639 --> 01:00:43,118
that there is no point to add more uh

1530
01:00:41,358 --> 01:00:45,440
microriser in

1531
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:47,280
then you really can i don't know how

1532
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:48,400
many cycles you need in order to reach

1533
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:51,920
there

1534
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:54,000
but biologically it's possible

1535
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:55,358
okay yeah and and one other thing that i

1536
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,639
wanted to highlight is

1537
01:00:55,358 --> 01:00:58,558
along these lines from what you're

1538
01:00:56,639 --> 01:01:01,838
saying it makes no sense to just

1539
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:04,960
mix the mycorrhizal spores

1540
01:01:01,838 --> 01:01:06,159
homogeneously through our soils it seems

1541
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:08,480
like that would be

1542
01:01:06,159 --> 01:01:10,480
not very economical relative to applying

1543
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:14,000
it directly to the roots

1544
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:14,240
yeah that's what we we we tried we call

1545
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,280
it

1546
01:01:14,239 --> 01:01:19,199
like i mean we try to uh to create a

1547
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:20,640
situation when we dust i mean you you

1548
01:01:19,199 --> 01:01:23,118
you even can raise your

1549
01:01:20,639 --> 01:01:24,239
uh let's say if you if you missed it

1550
01:01:23,119 --> 01:01:26,798
then you cannot really

1551
01:01:24,239 --> 01:01:29,039
you are not applying it to the to the to

1552
01:01:26,798 --> 01:01:32,159
the rooting flag in the beginning

1553
01:01:29,039 --> 01:01:32,880
uh once you have the first uh uh when

1554
01:01:32,159 --> 01:01:35,759
you

1555
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:36,559
transfer it to the to the next stage

1556
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:39,760
then

1557
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:42,798
you can dust off the whole uh

1558
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:46,240
how we call it a uh chunk of

1559
01:01:42,798 --> 01:01:48,559
wood plague uh with uh with the

1560
01:01:46,239 --> 01:01:49,598
mycorrhizae and then make sure that

1561
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:52,079
every

1562
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:52,798
segment which is emerging out of that

1563
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:55,599
plug

1564
01:01:52,798 --> 01:01:56,559
to the soil somehow we'll be will get

1565
01:01:55,599 --> 01:01:59,519
infection

1566
01:01:56,559 --> 01:02:00,798
and that you can do it this way too so

1567
01:01:59,519 --> 01:02:03,119
you don't really need a

1568
01:02:00,798 --> 01:02:04,000
much uh for that it's like you know if

1569
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:07,760
you

1570
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:09,838
like a dusting uh donuts uh with

1571
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:10,880
sugar i mean you don't need much of it

1572
01:02:09,838 --> 01:02:14,480
you just need to

1573
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:15,358
and the the the the rest or the excess

1574
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:18,400
amount

1575
01:02:15,358 --> 01:02:21,279
uh you can really kind of shake it

1576
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:22,400
and uh it's really minimal amount only

1577
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:26,319
on the surface

1578
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:26,318
and and you can

1579
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:32,880
make sure that you'll have uh

1580
01:02:30,239 --> 01:02:34,318
rain in the right concentration and

1581
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:38,079
really meet uh

1582
01:02:34,318 --> 01:02:40,318
the terms of good colonization

1583
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:41,680
now one of the things that i i want to

1584
01:02:40,318 --> 01:02:42,558
talk to you about real quick before we

1585
01:02:41,679 --> 01:02:45,919
get off

1586
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:49,039
the phone call was you helped create

1587
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:51,599
in a lab this uh this particular

1588
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:52,160
super strain of of mycorrhizal fungus

1589
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:55,200
that

1590
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:56,399
is used in the product dinomico correct

1591
01:02:55,199 --> 01:02:58,318
can you can you talk a little bit about

1592
01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:02,000
that

1593
01:02:58,318 --> 01:03:05,279
uh well i can talk as uh

1594
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:06,159
yeah i can talk about it uh in general

1595
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:08,319
terms of course

1596
01:03:06,159 --> 01:03:09,440
i know some of this stuff is proprietary

1597
01:03:08,318 --> 01:03:11,759
and i i just mean

1598
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:12,880
in terms of um you worked on this

1599
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:14,640
particular product

1600
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:16,400
and you saw some of the results around

1601
01:03:14,639 --> 01:03:18,318
it i was hoping maybe you could

1602
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:19,920
cover that not necessarily the the

1603
01:03:18,318 --> 01:03:23,119
methodology which

1604
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:23,119
you may not be able to share

1605
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:30,880
uh what would be uh

1606
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:33,280
the exact question i mean yes we we

1607
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:35,119
i know uh many of these uh i mean i know

1608
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:38,000
those trends you know the superstars

1609
01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:39,280
there is more than one but uh even the

1610
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,920
the best one uh

1611
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:43,280
of course i i i'm familiar with that and

1612
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:45,838
uh

1613
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:45,839
i think that

1614
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:53,358
that product came through a very

1615
01:03:50,639 --> 01:03:53,358
intensive

1616
01:03:54,318 --> 01:03:59,599
development which is uh technically but

1617
01:03:58,159 --> 01:04:00,318
also biological development which

1618
01:03:59,599 --> 01:04:04,559
allowing

1619
01:04:00,318 --> 01:04:07,199
uh uh which brought it to the level

1620
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:08,960
that you can have uh millions and

1621
01:04:07,199 --> 01:04:12,480
millions of spores

1622
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:15,599
uh uh which are

1623
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:18,079
free of soil of course uh and you can

1624
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:19,440
really make sure that you have just

1625
01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:22,480
mycorrhizae

1626
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:25,838
and you can uh set it up in

1627
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:30,719
in a way that you have in small volume a

1628
01:04:25,838 --> 01:04:30,719
very high concentration of of spores

1629
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:38,639
in a very uh not just efficient

1630
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:39,359
but a very effective way for for

1631
01:04:38,639 --> 01:04:41,679
infection

1632
01:04:39,358 --> 01:04:42,798
and that's something which is a very

1633
01:04:41,679 --> 01:04:45,519
important i mean

1634
01:04:42,798 --> 01:04:48,159
they are actually giving you uh

1635
01:04:45,519 --> 01:04:51,920
something which is uh

1636
01:04:48,159 --> 01:04:54,879
maybe i should use which is being primed

1637
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:56,318
ahead of time and ready to go and this

1638
01:04:54,880 --> 01:05:00,079
is the advantage of

1639
01:04:56,318 --> 01:05:03,119
of that uh product and uh

1640
01:05:00,079 --> 01:05:05,680
you know and the results are uh

1641
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:07,519
nothing better than where uh you you

1642
01:05:05,679 --> 01:05:10,719
know uh

1643
01:05:07,519 --> 01:05:15,759
the effect of the product on the plant

1644
01:05:10,719 --> 01:05:20,639
is very convincing and i think that

1645
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:20,640
the uniqueness of this product is

1646
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:25,358
many goals i probably can i can tell you

1647
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:25,358
better

1648
01:05:26,159 --> 01:05:29,199
remember that i never did it myself

1649
01:05:28,719 --> 01:05:32,480
everything

1650
01:05:29,199 --> 01:05:35,598
was done by a new application to

1651
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:38,960
to uh to cannabis

1652
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:42,240
was uh was not done in our lab but

1653
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:45,679
uh i'm sure that the company

1654
01:05:42,239 --> 01:05:47,519
they check it and they tried and uh

1655
01:05:45,679 --> 01:05:50,480
you know the proof is in the pudding i

1656
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:54,318
mean that's working great

1657
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:55,838
great um yeah so the this particular

1658
01:05:54,318 --> 01:05:57,358
product was originally

1659
01:05:55,838 --> 01:05:59,599
researched and developed out of the

1660
01:05:57,358 --> 01:06:01,519
vulcani center

1661
01:05:59,599 --> 01:06:03,359
correct and then and then moved to a

1662
01:06:01,519 --> 01:06:06,480
sort of a private

1663
01:06:03,358 --> 01:06:07,759
enterprise but uh yeah that was that was

1664
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:08,480
sort of what i was getting at so thank

1665
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:11,760
you

1666
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:13,679
um one uh one last question i had for

1667
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:14,160
you that was sort of unrelated but one

1668
01:06:13,679 --> 01:06:17,358
that i

1669
01:06:14,159 --> 01:06:18,960
i hear debated by growers that i think

1670
01:06:17,358 --> 01:06:21,119
you could answer

1671
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:23,440
fairly readily is this idea of

1672
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:27,599
rhizosphere ph and the importance

1673
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:31,838
of ph some organic growers

1674
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:33,760
don't really don't use ph as a tool

1675
01:06:31,838 --> 01:06:35,440
because they say that the the soil's

1676
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:36,400
ability and the microbes ability to

1677
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:38,798
buffer

1678
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:39,920
is so great that it's less important

1679
01:06:38,798 --> 01:06:43,920
however

1680
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:47,519
some of us like myself feel that while

1681
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:50,639
there is an aspect to that by optimizing

1682
01:06:47,519 --> 01:06:53,679
uh ph in rhizosphere

1683
01:06:50,639 --> 01:06:55,920
and in the soil we're allowing for these

1684
01:06:53,679 --> 01:06:58,480
the plant to have less stress and to

1685
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:58,480
make these

1686
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:02,798
uh make it easier for the plant to

1687
01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:05,280
uptake nutrients

1688
01:07:02,798 --> 01:07:07,838
um yeah what what are your thoughts on

1689
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:11,519
this and how do microbes

1690
01:07:07,838 --> 01:07:15,119
help in uh sort of that ph

1691
01:07:11,519 --> 01:07:17,920
and rhizosphere relationship

1692
01:07:15,119 --> 01:07:20,000
first of all uh well microbes do have

1693
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:23,519
some effect on the rise of suffering

1694
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:26,719
on the rises for ph but the most

1695
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:27,759
important mechanism that alter the ph of

1696
01:07:26,719 --> 01:07:31,118
the rhizosphere

1697
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:33,200
is the plant itself and uh

1698
01:07:31,119 --> 01:07:35,119
in order to absorb the anion and

1699
01:07:33,199 --> 01:07:36,960
cartilage and there's exchange of anions

1700
01:07:35,119 --> 01:07:39,920
at calcium cations

1701
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:42,000
i mean the nutrients the the charge of

1702
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:44,240
the molecules is very important

1703
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,280
and it's very important if you feed your

1704
01:07:44,239 --> 01:07:48,000
plant with

1705
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:49,440
ammonium or you feed yourself with a

1706
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,760
nitrate

1707
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:52,798
that's make a significant effect on the

1708
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:55,280
ph of

1709
01:07:52,798 --> 01:07:56,239
of the rhizosphere so that's something

1710
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:58,960
which which

1711
01:07:56,239 --> 01:08:01,679
should be kept in mind if you really

1712
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:02,880
want to alter the ph of your rhizosphere

1713
01:08:01,679 --> 01:08:06,078
work out

1714
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:09,358
the uh the equations

1715
01:08:06,079 --> 01:08:12,798
or the the the compounds

1716
01:08:09,358 --> 01:08:14,318
the chemical structure of the nutrients

1717
01:08:12,798 --> 01:08:17,600
which you are using

1718
01:08:14,318 --> 01:08:20,640
if you will have more nitrogen then

1719
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:21,600
your ph will level up if you have more

1720
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:25,440
ammonia

1721
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:28,798
your ph will level down

1722
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:29,838
and that's more effect this is more

1723
01:08:28,798 --> 01:08:32,399
significant

1724
01:08:29,838 --> 01:08:32,880
than the microbes themselves and of

1725
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:36,079
course

1726
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:38,798
uh the organic compounds which are being

1727
01:08:36,079 --> 01:08:42,158
exuded from the roots are

1728
01:08:38,798 --> 01:08:45,359
actually also a second layer of

1729
01:08:42,158 --> 01:08:48,148
effectors on the on the ph itself

1730
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:49,440
and that's something which uh we can

1731
01:08:48,149 --> 01:08:53,039
[Music]

1732
01:08:49,439 --> 01:08:56,879
barely uh control

1733
01:08:53,039 --> 01:09:00,238
control uh so uh the question is

1734
01:08:56,880 --> 01:09:03,199
what's really happening in in the in the

1735
01:09:00,238 --> 01:09:04,798
if you have a lot of sugar let's say and

1736
01:09:03,198 --> 01:09:06,710
you have a suffer strength

1737
01:09:04,798 --> 01:09:08,399
i don't know if you it's uh

1738
01:09:06,710 --> 01:09:12,520
[Music]

1739
01:09:08,399 --> 01:09:15,198
you know all the writers is covered with

1740
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:16,080
microorganisms like exactly like in our

1741
01:09:15,198 --> 01:09:19,759
gut

1742
01:09:16,079 --> 01:09:20,000
uh you know and you know that uh some of

1743
01:09:19,759 --> 01:09:23,198
those

1744
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:26,319
micronesia are responding uh to

1745
01:09:23,198 --> 01:09:27,519
uh the given amount of the type of food

1746
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:29,920
that we are eating

1747
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:31,359
i mean in our gut the same happening at

1748
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:34,399
the rhizosphere level

1749
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:36,159
and if you know our rhizosphere is going

1750
01:09:34,399 --> 01:09:38,238
to exude

1751
01:09:36,158 --> 01:09:39,358
some molecules the the bacteria over

1752
01:09:38,238 --> 01:09:42,399
there will

1753
01:09:39,359 --> 01:09:44,960
transfer it will the molecules

1754
01:09:42,399 --> 01:09:46,399
and can reach a situation that can

1755
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:50,319
influence

1756
01:09:46,399 --> 01:09:53,358
the ph and uh last and not least

1757
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:54,560
is a variation in the rhizosphere uh do

1758
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:57,280
you have enough air

1759
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:57,679
or you have anaerobic conditions uh that

1760
01:09:57,279 --> 01:10:00,719
will

1761
01:09:57,679 --> 01:10:03,520
inference also the type of bacteria that

1762
01:10:00,719 --> 01:10:04,239
can grow there and we finally will

1763
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:08,400
affect

1764
01:10:04,238 --> 01:10:11,519
uh the uh the the ph

1765
01:10:08,399 --> 01:10:14,960
uh you have uh phosphorus uh

1766
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:18,640
uh was so sorry let's talk about

1767
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:21,840
uh sulfate if you have a

1768
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:25,280
free sulfate somehow uh

1769
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:27,760
you get a lower ph in the in the

1770
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:29,119
in the hydrosphere so the chemistry and

1771
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:31,920
the biology

1772
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:32,719
although all the time is working and i'm

1773
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:34,560
sure that

1774
01:10:32,719 --> 01:10:36,399
i mean you'll get a good recommendation

1775
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:39,440
if you have a good

1776
01:10:36,399 --> 01:10:43,039
nutrient solution that will have high

1777
01:10:39,439 --> 01:10:46,879
buffer capacity then you can eliminate

1778
01:10:43,039 --> 01:10:47,760
those a type of of changes in the

1779
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:49,840
rhizosphere

1780
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:51,039
it's very important uh you know trying

1781
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:54,239
to understand

1782
01:10:51,039 --> 01:10:57,198
what group of bacteria you have there

1783
01:10:54,238 --> 01:10:58,000
or other microorganism and trying to

1784
01:10:57,198 --> 01:11:01,039
influence this

1785
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,359
microorganism is kind of indirectly it

1786
01:11:01,039 --> 01:11:05,198
will

1787
01:11:01,359 --> 01:11:07,279
uh uh you know in in

1788
01:11:05,198 --> 01:11:08,319
conventional agriculture is almost

1789
01:11:07,279 --> 01:11:10,559
impossible

1790
01:11:08,319 --> 01:11:13,439
so the only way to go is to have a

1791
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:14,560
little solution which has a high buffer

1792
01:11:13,439 --> 01:11:18,559
capacity

1793
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:22,159
uh it can work out

1794
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:23,039
the difference that the rhizosphere the

1795
01:11:22,158 --> 01:11:25,359
bacteria

1796
01:11:23,039 --> 01:11:27,279
and even some of the effects of the

1797
01:11:25,359 --> 01:11:29,679
plant which i describe it

1798
01:11:27,279 --> 01:11:30,719
can can buffer it up and that's

1799
01:11:29,679 --> 01:11:33,840
something which uh

1800
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:35,840
uh it will be appreciated uh this is a

1801
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:39,039
practical uh

1802
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:42,480
uh recommendation uh uh

1803
01:11:39,039 --> 01:11:45,679
you know uh nowadays the microbiome

1804
01:11:42,479 --> 01:11:48,079
is uh is a new uh uh field that

1805
01:11:45,679 --> 01:11:50,560
uh every you know you can dive into this

1806
01:11:48,079 --> 01:11:53,600
field but it's very very hard

1807
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:55,679
uh to tip it uh of course if you have if

1808
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:58,000
you put some compost

1809
01:11:55,679 --> 01:11:59,840
in the roots uh then you are going to

1810
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:02,399
change uh the flora

1811
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:04,880
but also the conditions uh in in the in

1812
01:12:02,399 --> 01:12:08,399
the soil

1813
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:11,760
so yes ph is very important

1814
01:12:08,399 --> 01:12:14,319
uh under high ph you really want to to

1815
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:16,159
absorb if you really want your plant to

1816
01:12:14,319 --> 01:12:18,719
absorb enough iron

1817
01:12:16,158 --> 01:12:20,158
for the clothing to have a good color

1818
01:12:18,719 --> 01:12:23,198
and photosynthesis in the

1819
01:12:20,158 --> 01:12:25,679
in the leaves uh you

1820
01:12:23,198 --> 01:12:26,639
please make sure that the ph will not be

1821
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:29,520
above

1822
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:31,280
uh seven and a half uh even lower than

1823
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:33,440
that

1824
01:12:31,279 --> 01:12:36,319
you know six eight or something like

1825
01:12:33,439 --> 01:12:39,119
this if you have a low ph then your

1826
01:12:36,319 --> 01:12:42,238
plant will not be able to absorb some of

1827
01:12:39,119 --> 01:12:45,359
uh the goodies that is being needed for

1828
01:12:42,238 --> 01:12:45,839
for a good crop uh so this is something

1829
01:12:45,359 --> 01:12:48,479
which

1830
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:50,319
should be kept in mind uh my

1831
01:12:48,479 --> 01:12:53,198
recommendation is

1832
01:12:50,319 --> 01:12:54,559
take a a nutrient solution with a high

1833
01:12:53,198 --> 01:12:58,479
buffer capacity

1834
01:12:54,560 --> 01:13:01,760
and that will help you uh to overcome

1835
01:12:58,479 --> 01:13:04,000
those uh situation in the rice firm

1836
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:05,280
so is it safe to say that the the

1837
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,960
rhizosphere

1838
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:08,479
plant rhizosphere interactions and the

1839
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:10,960
rhizosphere itself is

1840
01:13:08,479 --> 01:13:12,479
is highly complicated we are still

1841
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:14,640
learning a lot about

1842
01:13:12,479 --> 01:13:15,919
the soil microbiome in relationship to

1843
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:19,199
the rhizosphere

1844
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:22,800
and by having the ph within

1845
01:13:19,198 --> 01:13:23,919
a range that is more optimal for the

1846
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:26,079
plant

1847
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:28,158
all we're doing is making it easier for

1848
01:13:26,079 --> 01:13:30,399
the plant to access nutrients which will

1849
01:13:28,158 --> 01:13:32,319
potentially reduce plant stress and

1850
01:13:30,399 --> 01:13:35,439
allow it to put more energy into

1851
01:13:32,319 --> 01:13:36,319
yield and growth and protection yeah

1852
01:13:35,439 --> 01:13:39,678
those are exactly

1853
01:13:36,319 --> 01:13:42,238
yeah okay you know if you yeah

1854
01:13:39,679 --> 01:13:43,199
if you can measure it uh if you can

1855
01:13:42,238 --> 01:13:45,678
control itself

1856
01:13:43,198 --> 01:13:47,519
you know under hydroponic conditions uh

1857
01:13:45,679 --> 01:13:50,800
i mean you can

1858
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:53,679
you have more tools to deal with

1859
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:54,480
with the ph but if you have a potting

1860
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:58,319
mix

1861
01:13:54,479 --> 01:14:02,000
uh it's it's harder to to start tipping

1862
01:13:58,319 --> 01:14:04,158
the ph in the middle of the season

1863
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:06,479
yeah so the way that we grow is

1864
01:14:04,158 --> 01:14:08,238
primarily in in potting soils organic

1865
01:14:06,479 --> 01:14:11,678
potting soils where we're

1866
01:14:08,238 --> 01:14:12,158
using soil testing in between cycles to

1867
01:14:11,679 --> 01:14:14,960
sort of

1868
01:14:12,158 --> 01:14:15,519
uh you know in some ways mimic uh you

1869
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:18,079
know

1870
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:19,840
outdoor agronomic practices uh by

1871
01:14:18,079 --> 01:14:22,399
managing that soil

1872
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:23,199
uh multiple cycles but in an indoor

1873
01:14:22,399 --> 01:14:26,479
environment so

1874
01:14:23,198 --> 01:14:28,719
we're constantly adjusting our

1875
01:14:26,479 --> 01:14:29,839
uh our nutrients that we're putting into

1876
01:14:28,719 --> 01:14:33,198
the soil to

1877
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:36,159
maintain as optimal of a ph

1878
01:14:33,198 --> 01:14:37,039
and and mineral balance as we can while

1879
01:14:36,158 --> 01:14:39,198
still

1880
01:14:37,039 --> 01:14:40,560
taking into account the the biological

1881
01:14:39,198 --> 01:14:43,599
aspects of

1882
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:45,120
of the soil itself too so yeah

1883
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:47,280
and of course you have to remember that

1884
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:49,198
you have to change your your schedule

1885
01:14:47,279 --> 01:14:51,039
the the nutrition schedule between

1886
01:14:49,198 --> 01:14:53,279
vegetative goals

1887
01:14:51,039 --> 01:14:54,399
and the reproductive goals i mean you

1888
01:14:53,279 --> 01:14:56,319
need a

1889
01:14:54,399 --> 01:14:59,279
different schedule there too i mean you

1890
01:14:56,319 --> 01:15:02,719
cannot use one uh

1891
01:14:59,279 --> 01:15:05,840
equation for the entire growth uh

1892
01:15:02,719 --> 01:15:08,719
cycle uh for uh

1893
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:10,319
cannabis growth right sure so so the the

1894
01:15:08,719 --> 01:15:11,119
nutrients that the plant is going to

1895
01:15:10,319 --> 01:15:12,880
want when it's

1896
01:15:11,119 --> 01:15:14,079
in a vegetative state are quite

1897
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:15,679
different than what it's going to want

1898
01:15:14,079 --> 01:15:17,519
when it's flowering

1899
01:15:15,679 --> 01:15:19,199
right so you're saying yes that makes

1900
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:22,880
sense

1901
01:15:19,198 --> 01:15:25,039
well uh dr kapolnik i know i could

1902
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:26,800
i could ask you a million more questions

1903
01:15:25,039 --> 01:15:27,519
