00:00:16,339 --> 00:00:21,539
welcome to the cannabis cultivation and

3
00:00:18,778 --> 00:00:23,490
science podcast I'm your host tad hussy

4
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:25,470
of KISS organics this is the podcast

5
00:00:23,489 --> 00:00:27,329
where we discuss the cutting edge of

6
00:00:25,469 --> 00:00:29,309
growing from a science-based perspective

7
00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:30,809
and draw on top experts from around the

8
00:00:29,309 --> 00:00:33,058
industry to share their wisdom and

9
00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:35,039
knowledge the bio controllers conference

10
00:00:33,058 --> 00:00:36,629
from last podcast was a lot of fun and I

11
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:38,820
met some great growers who attended the

12
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:40,950
cannabis track I hope to see more folks

13
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,539
of future bough controls conferences and

14
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,370
was grateful for the opportunity to

15
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:45,539
speak on how to evaluate commercial

16
00:00:44,369 --> 00:00:48,628
products when making production

17
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:51,120
decisions this week's podcast relates to

18
00:00:48,628 --> 00:00:53,039
soil testing a lot of growers and

19
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:54,839
cannabis consultants use soil tests to

20
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,820
make fertility decisions for this crop

21
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,649
what I learned in the last two weeks

22
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,808
really changed the way I view these

23
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:02,429
tests and my conversation with our next

24
00:01:00,808 --> 00:01:04,679
guests will hopefully explain in better

25
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:06,659
detail how these tests work what

26
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,520
information on them is most useful and

27
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:11,250
what we should be basing our production

28
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:12,989
decisions on this week's guest is Bill

29
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,609
McKibben bill is an accomplished

30
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:16,829
agronomist and author of two books

31
00:01:14,609 --> 00:01:19,200
relating to soils the art of balancing

32
00:01:16,829 --> 00:01:21,509
soil nutrients and the growers guide to

33
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,180
balancing soil nutrients he has been

34
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:27,269
consulting on soil fertility since 1976

35
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:29,189
and graduated in 1975 from the Ohio

36
00:01:27,269 --> 00:01:31,319
State University with a master's of

37
00:01:29,188 --> 00:01:33,419
science and soil chemistry he is a

38
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:35,849
consultant to Logan labs and the owner

39
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,350
of soil take tech incorporated I've

40
00:01:35,849 --> 00:01:38,849
talked to Bill in the past regarding

41
00:01:37,349 --> 00:01:40,978
soil testing but this latest

42
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:43,709
conversation we focused on potting soils

43
00:01:40,978 --> 00:01:45,750
or highly amended soils with many of us

44
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:47,829
in this industry call super soil or

45
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:51,189
living soil

46
00:01:47,829 --> 00:01:54,039
hi bill welcome to the show oh thank you

47
00:01:51,189 --> 00:01:56,709
good afternoon I appreciate you coming

48
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:59,110
on today I wanted to give listeners a

49
00:01:56,709 --> 00:02:01,030
little background into how I ended up

50
00:01:59,109 --> 00:02:03,370
chatting with you we've we've actually

51
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:05,079
talked we talked quite a few years back

52
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:07,290
but this time around

53
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:09,399
Michael over at Maine crafts cannabis

54
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:11,710
he's a good friend of mine we were

55
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:14,139
chatting and he had called and talked to

56
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:16,300
Susan the lab director at Logan labs and

57
00:02:14,139 --> 00:02:18,339
he called me up and he's like hey tad I

58
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:21,430
was talking to Susan and she was saying

59
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:23,319
that some of these numbers on the mail

60
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:27,670
ik 3 test which is your standard soil

61
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:31,120
test are not very usable when we're

62
00:02:27,669 --> 00:02:32,739
doing these soil evaluations and so they

63
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,569
I had a I had a conversation with her

64
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:37,629
about you know how much they're using in

65
00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:39,489
a sample about the you know exchange

66
00:02:37,629 --> 00:02:40,659
capacity and what these numbers look

67
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:43,420
like and what they mean when we're

68
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:45,459
talking about potting soils versus you

69
00:02:43,419 --> 00:02:49,389
know native soils or agricultural soils

70
00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:51,909
and so bill I just wanted to kind of

71
00:02:49,389 --> 00:02:54,219
talk about you know a little bit about

72
00:02:51,909 --> 00:02:56,500
what what some of these numbers mean on

73
00:02:54,219 --> 00:02:59,289
a soil report and for listeners I'm

74
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:01,000
gonna have a am a lick three and a

75
00:02:59,289 --> 00:03:03,849
saturated paste of our commercial

76
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,469
growers mix on the podcast page so

77
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:07,090
please go check that out and that's what

78
00:03:05,469 --> 00:03:08,199
bill and I are going to be working off

79
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:09,580
of when we're talking about different

80
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:12,280
numbers so that we're all on the same

81
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:14,950
page for looking at the same test so

82
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:17,469
bill can you talk a little bit about the

83
00:03:14,949 --> 00:03:19,539
Mallik 3 test and what that what they're

84
00:03:17,469 --> 00:03:21,729
actually testing and how much material

85
00:03:19,539 --> 00:03:23,979
they're using and and just a little bit

86
00:03:21,729 --> 00:03:27,280
about that process before we will start

87
00:03:23,979 --> 00:03:30,609
looking at numbers sure sure

88
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,319
I am big I don't really work at Logan

89
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:34,330
labs I'm the agronomist to Logan labs

90
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,799
but I'm pretty familiar with whatever

91
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:40,060
they whatever they're doing down there

92
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:43,000
and Susan and I talk almost daily so you

93
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:46,060
know the melech 3 and we've had this

94
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,379
discussion that really really the melech

95
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:53,549
3 is designed for soil

96
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:56,669
soil extraction not so much the these

97
00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:59,680
modified mixes I call them MGM's

98
00:03:56,669 --> 00:04:01,419
modified growing mix as some people call

99
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,670
them soilless mix

100
00:04:01,419 --> 00:04:05,530
I know I've talked to people on the

101
00:04:03,669 --> 00:04:08,589
phone that said when I said soilless mix

102
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:10,840
no no it's a soil well if it's if it's

103
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:14,950
modified with all this peat and

104
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:17,290
everything core fiber it's really not a

105
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:20,529
a soil especially once you get these

106
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:21,510
organic matters up to above 25-30

107
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:25,388
percent

108
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:28,209
this test was really not designed for

109
00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:30,780
that kind of material

110
00:04:28,209 --> 00:04:36,009
so the

111
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:39,039
Melek extraction is a pH of 2.5 so it is

112
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:41,289
fairly acidic and in these these

113
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:45,040
modified mixes where you're adding lime

114
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:49,060
it can it can dissolve that that lime

115
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:52,150
and make it look like you've got a lot

116
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:54,310
more material a lot more calcium on the

117
00:04:52,149 --> 00:04:56,459
standard test and maybe what's really

118
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:59,259
available

119
00:04:56,459 --> 00:05:03,099
yes that's a good point and one thing I

120
00:04:59,259 --> 00:05:05,139
want to highlight regarding these tests

121
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:07,030
as well that you brought up is the

122
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:09,038
original goal of these tests was to

123
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:11,250
admit you know you're using soil so sand

124
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:13,469
silt and clay we're looking at the

125
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:16,538
amount of

126
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:18,580
the fractions of these of these

127
00:05:16,538 --> 00:05:20,129
different types of soils and so it's

128
00:05:18,579 --> 00:05:24,069
very different like you mentioned

129
00:05:20,129 --> 00:05:26,469
however sort of the the colloquial trade

130
00:05:24,069 --> 00:05:27,759
term for a lot of the soils and what we

131
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:29,500
make is called they're a lot of people

132
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,360
are calling them living soils now but

133
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,759
you're right they're soilless mixes so a

134
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,830
living soil

135
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:37,779
by this industry cannabis standard is

136
00:05:35,829 --> 00:05:39,370
really what a lot people are calling

137
00:05:37,779 --> 00:05:42,909
super soils and it's like a heavily

138
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:45,038
amended soilless mix that is then reused

139
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:46,330
multiple cycles so I just want to make

140
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:51,029
sure we're all on the same terms in

141
00:05:46,329 --> 00:05:51,029
terms of like nomenclature here but

142
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,780
and one of one of the things I like to

143
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:57,819
point out when you mentioned the sand

144
00:05:55,779 --> 00:06:00,339
silt and clay and that's really what the

145
00:05:57,819 --> 00:06:02,699
melech extraction was designed to do was

146
00:06:00,339 --> 00:06:07,719
to remove

147
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:11,639
nutrients off of the colloids now really

148
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:14,530
really these these modified mixes

149
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:16,878
don't have a lot of colloids it's

150
00:06:14,529 --> 00:06:20,109
basically a bunch of minerals that's

151
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:24,740
floating around in an organic substrate

152
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:27,249
and so that's that again poses a problem

153
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:29,569
for the some of the data

154
00:06:27,249 --> 00:06:31,039
yeah and I want to come back to that

155
00:06:29,569 --> 00:06:35,149
when we start talking about exchange

156
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:37,908
capacity but one question that I was

157
00:06:35,149 --> 00:06:40,610
wondering about regarding these tests

158
00:06:37,908 --> 00:06:43,998
when you talk about these these peat

159
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:46,580
mixes or cocoa mixes is all of these

160
00:06:43,999 --> 00:06:48,680
things have a purported cation exchange

161
00:06:46,579 --> 00:06:51,258
of value like I can go online and look

162
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:53,538
up you know an average compost or an

163
00:06:51,259 --> 00:06:56,119
average peat mix how does that translate

164
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:57,938
when we're talking about these may like

165
00:06:56,119 --> 00:07:00,680
three tests

166
00:06:57,939 --> 00:07:02,449
well see this is where we're I think

167
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:05,119
it's a little bit fuzzy you know they

168
00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:08,689
they say that when you when you look at

169
00:07:05,119 --> 00:07:11,059
a soil and you say well the the organic

170
00:07:08,689 --> 00:07:13,059
matter is contributing to the exchange

171
00:07:11,059 --> 00:07:16,039
capacity

172
00:07:13,059 --> 00:07:18,319
you know that's really it's more of a

173
00:07:16,038 --> 00:07:22,158
human that's contributing to the

174
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:25,360
exchange capacity I think then then just

175
00:07:22,158 --> 00:07:27,860
the fact that it's organic matter and

176
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,538
so you know I'm sure some people might

177
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:31,729
disagree with that but that that's kind

178
00:07:29,538 --> 00:07:34,818
of the way I look at it again it's I

179
00:07:31,728 --> 00:07:37,870
know that when we look at these organic

180
00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:40,789
matters in these these modified mixes

181
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:43,490
and then and then the calculation is

182
00:07:40,788 --> 00:07:45,158
done for en are the estimated estimated

183
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:48,918
nitrogen release

184
00:07:45,158 --> 00:07:50,829
those numbers very dependable and again

185
00:07:48,918 --> 00:07:52,658
so I think that

186
00:07:50,829 --> 00:07:55,459
that

187
00:07:52,658 --> 00:07:57,278
you know they might be able to say that

188
00:07:55,459 --> 00:07:59,990
there there's some

189
00:07:57,278 --> 00:08:02,168
exchange capacity there but I think it's

190
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:04,610
very minimal

191
00:08:02,168 --> 00:08:06,109
so you're another impression that these

192
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:09,769
things don't actually have the exchange

193
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:11,559
capacity that is purported to them you

194
00:08:09,769 --> 00:08:14,740
know when you start looking online

195
00:08:11,559 --> 00:08:17,629
which is interesting

196
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:22,218
the other the other question around

197
00:08:17,629 --> 00:08:26,838
around this would be if if that is the

198
00:08:22,218 --> 00:08:28,129
case then what's keeping these so so

199
00:08:26,838 --> 00:08:29,969
essentially when you talk about you're

200
00:08:28,129 --> 00:08:31,290
talking about organic matter houmous and

201
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:32,969
things breaking down well houmous is one

202
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:36,300
of the most controversial things in the

203
00:08:32,969 --> 00:08:37,950
soil science field anyway but

204
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:40,649
essentially the concept being that

205
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:42,658
organic matter is is slowly breaking

206
00:08:40,649 --> 00:08:44,639
down all the time you know it's

207
00:08:42,658 --> 00:08:46,529
essentially composting and this organic

208
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:50,279
matter is breaking down into something

209
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:51,779
that eventually is undistinguishable you

210
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:55,889
can't tell if that original organic

211
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:59,039
matter was plant matter a human foot you

212
00:08:55,889 --> 00:09:02,009
know whatever sort of organic matter you

213
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:03,629
want to think of it's now virtually

214
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:06,080
indistinguishable on a microscopic level

215
00:09:03,629 --> 00:09:08,059
and it has this

216
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:12,000
excellent you know

217
00:09:08,059 --> 00:09:14,699
biological you know capacity and also

218
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,980
excellent cation exchange capacity or

219
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:20,160
ability to hold onto nutrients when

220
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:21,750
we're talking about human so you know in

221
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:23,490
theory this the higher your organic

222
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:25,620
matter the more its breaking down and

223
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:27,750
the more your you're building houmous

224
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:29,159
over time and traditionally this takes a

225
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:31,620
long time that there's a lot of

226
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:32,669
speculation on that does that sound does

227
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,110
that sound about right or do you have

228
00:09:32,669 --> 00:09:36,870
more that you'd want to add regarding it

229
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:39,509
yeah that sounds about right and I think

230
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:42,720
when you look at if you're looking at it

231
00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:46,259
on some sort of time scale the if you're

232
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:48,180
taking a peat in there versus a human

233
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:50,429
that's developed in the soil there's a

234
00:09:48,179 --> 00:09:53,088
huge difference in the time scale now

235
00:09:50,429 --> 00:09:56,338
maybe I shouldn't say that

236
00:09:53,089 --> 00:10:00,390
that there's no exchange capacity on a

237
00:09:56,339 --> 00:10:03,510
peat but I think it gets as it continues

238
00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:05,370
to break down and and actually it's

239
00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:09,029
going to now make the organic matter

240
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:11,730
kind of more concentrated or well get to

241
00:10:09,029 --> 00:10:14,429
the point where it is not going to break

242
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:17,399
down any further that's when it I think

243
00:10:14,429 --> 00:10:18,949
it has the maximum amount of nutrient

244
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:21,629
holding capacity

245
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:25,440
that makes sense now peat is interesting

246
00:10:21,629 --> 00:10:27,889
because it is harvested and it is

247
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:31,320
traditionally something that's already

248
00:10:27,889 --> 00:10:32,819
you know fairly old relatively speaking

249
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:35,129
it's already organic matter that's been

250
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:38,280
breaking down in these bogs for a period

251
00:10:35,129 --> 00:10:41,070
of time and there's a lot of speculation

252
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:43,939
too about how sustainable it is and how

253
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:47,850
long it takes for PETA is a

254
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:49,470
is a whole nother topic but yeah you

255
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:52,320
know compared to like cocoa core which

256
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:54,899
is a relatively fresh material relative

257
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,580
to Pete it certainly seems like Pete

258
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:58,500
would would be breaking down towards

259
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:00,899
humans or be more a much more stable

260
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:04,470
component when we talk about its humic

261
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:07,919
fraction relative to cocoa well I think

262
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:10,379
that that's a fair fair comparison there

263
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:12,509
but but I've seen Pete's where you can

264
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:14,458
actually see the sticks that are still

265
00:11:12,509 --> 00:11:17,309
in there and so I mean I think the

266
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:19,309
quality of Pete there's a whole scale of

267
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:21,689
quality on Pete

268
00:11:19,309 --> 00:11:24,689
that's that's a really good point yeah

269
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:26,490
not all Pete is the same though I will

270
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:28,740
say one thing that Tim Wilson discovered

271
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:30,509
was that Pete is not necessarily sterile

272
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:32,100
either like a lot of people assume it to

273
00:11:30,509 --> 00:11:33,179
be when you throw it out of the

274
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,040
microscope there's quite a bit of

275
00:11:33,179 --> 00:11:37,620
biological activity going on in there

276
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:38,899
which from an or gate perspective is is

277
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:42,769
great

278
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:45,419
now before we dive into the TEC too much

279
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:47,970
one thing I wanted to touch on is you

280
00:11:45,419 --> 00:11:49,620
mentioned free calcium so for example

281
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:51,778
when I mix my soil I'm putting in

282
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:55,110
agricultural lime it's a fairly fine

283
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:59,399
mesh or grind so it's almost like flour

284
00:11:55,110 --> 00:12:02,730
and in theory if that's not been cycled

285
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:05,899
yet by the microbes it could really skew

286
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:09,389
these tests or show up as free calcium

287
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:10,708
and so what we have we took what

288
00:12:09,389 --> 00:12:12,990
typically what growers do when they have

289
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:15,989
Callister whistles is they'll do a fizz

290
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:18,570
test with vinegar and then they make it

291
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:21,509
the AAA 8.2 can you talk a little bit

292
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:23,610
about that test and how that's more

293
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:25,250
accurate in regards to calcium before we

294
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:28,560
get into the exchange capacity stuff

295
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:30,870
well you know this is where you and I

296
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:34,708
probably will separate company here on

297
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:37,950
this a bit the you know I'm not a big

298
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:42,889
fan of the adjusting the the melon or

299
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:45,589
the ammonium acetate 28.2 only because

300
00:12:42,889 --> 00:12:50,659
it's it's

301
00:12:45,589 --> 00:12:56,010
it's basically at 8.2 8.3 is when when

302
00:12:50,659 --> 00:13:00,299
calcium carbonate stops dissociating so

303
00:12:56,009 --> 00:13:02,460
so what you're doing at 8 to 8 3 pH

304
00:13:00,299 --> 00:13:06,299
extraction you're basically looking at

305
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:11,360
what is what is what calcium in there

306
00:13:06,299 --> 00:13:15,299
that is not calcium carbonate and

307
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:16,409
I I'm not saying that that for some

308
00:13:15,299 --> 00:13:18,870
people that might not be good

309
00:13:16,409 --> 00:13:23,250
information but for me I'm not I'm not

310
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:26,039
concerned that much with what is not

311
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:29,570
calcium carbonate I think that'll show

312
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:33,539
up things like calcium chloride calcium

313
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:35,580
gypsum z' those type of things but it's

314
00:13:33,539 --> 00:13:39,209
going to it's going to leave the calcium

315
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:44,129
calcium carbonate on the table - is a

316
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:46,139
huge factor here but again at 8.2 it

317
00:13:44,129 --> 00:13:50,340
should just be taking out calcium

318
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:54,299
showing up calcium that is not calcium

319
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:57,050
carbonate the the other thing is when I

320
00:13:54,299 --> 00:14:00,750
look at the 8.2

321
00:13:57,049 --> 00:14:03,089
that is we're going to use it you use it

322
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:05,610
for I would think for just pure calcium

323
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:08,389
because I think it really underestimates

324
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:12,419
magnesium and potassium

325
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:14,819
totally interesting ok so I'm not saying

326
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:18,120
that there isn't some value in it but

327
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:22,020
for me as a consultant I'm not a I'm not

328
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:25,950
a real big fan of using that if you find

329
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:28,350
that wow I really get some benefit from

330
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:32,250
it then that's fine you can't argue with

331
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:34,889
success but I I'm I would just soon do

332
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:39,169
the Malick and the paste analysis and

333
00:14:34,889 --> 00:14:42,059
make my make my judgments from those

334
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:44,669
so how do you know then if you're not

335
00:14:42,059 --> 00:14:47,279
getting over-reported calcium values on

336
00:14:44,669 --> 00:14:50,669
the on the mailing test on the standard

337
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:52,439
soil test well I think I think when you

338
00:14:50,669 --> 00:14:54,120
run the Malick it's going to desert

339
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,190
that's good unless you've got so much

340
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:58,190
calcium in there that it neutralizes the

341
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:59,720
Malick extraction

342
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:02,070
solution

343
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:04,070
which is which is going to be really

344
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:07,530
really high

345
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:09,270
you're going to you're going to dissolve

346
00:15:07,529 --> 00:15:12,029
that calcium and that's going to is

347
00:15:09,269 --> 00:15:14,389
going to show up as a as part of the

348
00:15:12,029 --> 00:15:17,610
shays capacity

349
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:20,370
so I mean but but then again you know my

350
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:22,710
my concept of these modify growing media

351
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:26,720
is I've got these nutrients in there

352
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:31,200
floating in the in the organic substrate

353
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:33,960
so now the question is okay I can look

354
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:37,759
and I can tell you with the with the

355
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:37,759
malloc that the calcium

356
00:15:38,899 --> 00:15:44,699
the calcium we have in here is

357
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:48,420
potentially available but then I rely on

358
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:50,690
the pace to say do I have enough sitting

359
00:15:48,419 --> 00:15:55,019
out here in solution

360
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:56,940
that that will feed the plant and we're

361
00:15:55,019 --> 00:15:58,370
looking for sufficiency values on the

362
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:02,990
pace test

363
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:02,990
looking for sufficiency levels

364
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:10,498
yes yes I'm looking at

365
00:16:07,938 --> 00:16:12,269
sufficiency I'd like to see a balance in

366
00:16:10,499 --> 00:16:14,058
the paste but I also want to see certain

367
00:16:12,269 --> 00:16:16,519
sufficiency levels

368
00:16:14,058 --> 00:16:18,480
okay well let's let's save the page

369
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:20,698
saturated paste I do want to talk about

370
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:24,959
that but let's can we talk a little bit

371
00:16:20,698 --> 00:16:27,058
more about the the male ik test so the

372
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:31,169
standard soil test in regards to how the

373
00:16:27,058 --> 00:16:32,368
lab processes it so I was not aware

374
00:16:31,169 --> 00:16:34,828
until it was brought to my attention

375
00:16:32,369 --> 00:16:38,540
that for the the male ik test they're

376
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:41,638
really only using two milligrams of

377
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:45,238
material I'm sorry to two milliliters of

378
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:47,639
material volume is that correct I think

379
00:16:45,239 --> 00:16:51,089
they're using a five mil coop it's a

380
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:53,308
five million now okay but a relatively

381
00:16:51,089 --> 00:16:56,339
small amount when we're talking about a

382
00:16:53,308 --> 00:16:58,438
potting soil that's that's probably not

383
00:16:56,339 --> 00:17:01,470
homogeneously mixed so I don't know how

384
00:16:58,438 --> 00:17:04,578
you can make a recommendation across you

385
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:06,980
know 50 yards of soil off of five

386
00:17:04,578 --> 00:17:10,888
milliliters in theory

387
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:14,000
yeah that that's the inherent problem in

388
00:17:10,888 --> 00:17:19,188
trying to run a soil test

389
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:21,568
went on on a modified mix and

390
00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:23,750
at the point at this point in time I

391
00:17:21,568 --> 00:17:26,188
don't know how you get around it

392
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:29,849
because what happens is when you

393
00:17:26,189 --> 00:17:33,000
dissolve that calcium it's it's it's now

394
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:35,908
picked up in the extracting solution run

395
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:41,548
through the through the ICP and it shows

396
00:17:35,909 --> 00:17:45,528
you may be in a much higher Tec because

397
00:17:41,548 --> 00:17:48,329
of the calcium that it dissolved

398
00:17:45,528 --> 00:17:50,519
so let's let's talk about the exchange

399
00:17:48,329 --> 00:17:53,329
capacity because a lot of the numbers on

400
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:55,798
this test are based off of

401
00:17:53,329 --> 00:17:57,269
essentially that whatever that reported

402
00:17:55,798 --> 00:17:59,879
exchange capacity is but what I'm

403
00:17:57,269 --> 00:18:01,558
hearing from the lab director Susan and

404
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,028
then from you too is that that exchange

405
00:18:01,558 --> 00:18:04,158
capacity is not a number that we can

406
00:18:03,028 --> 00:18:07,648
trust

407
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:10,970
that's not that it's not that's true

408
00:18:07,648 --> 00:18:13,739
that's true I could I could well

409
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:15,329
only don't want to stay quite that one I

410
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:17,099
want to hold that because I think that

411
00:18:15,329 --> 00:18:21,839
exchange capacity when you're looking at

412
00:18:17,099 --> 00:18:27,039
modified mixes our I would not use it as

413
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:29,230
to determine desired values see I think

414
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:31,480
I think when you take the desired values

415
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:34,360
off of these things because that's where

416
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:37,480
the exchange capacity is used to

417
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:39,159
determine desired values the values

418
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:42,910
found that's just reported what it's

419
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:44,640
found but the desired value that comes

420
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:47,560
in here

421
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:51,190
that's based on the exchange capacity

422
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:54,460
and setting these mixes up at 68 percent

423
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:57,900
calcium 12% base saturation and

424
00:18:54,460 --> 00:19:02,950
magnesium and four percent potassium

425
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:04,780
so it if you if you don't if you have to

426
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:08,590
have desired values well then you better

427
00:19:04,779 --> 00:19:11,740
better beware that those can be over

428
00:19:08,589 --> 00:19:15,449
exaggerated but I would I would like to

429
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:18,430
say that the exchange capacity I think

430
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:22,509
probably be best if we would use that

431
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:26,710
like we would at NC number in other

432
00:19:22,509 --> 00:19:28,799
words I think someplace between maybe 10

433
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:32,319
and 16

434
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:35,129
exchange capacity you get you get much

435
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:37,389
above that 16 exchange capacity

436
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:38,880
you're setting yourself up for some

437
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:41,500
salts problems

438
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:45,280
okay well I and that's that's

439
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:47,200
interesting because I you know we've

440
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:50,009
seen that you and I talked about this

441
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:52,180
how there's quite a bit of

442
00:19:50,009 --> 00:19:53,769
variation that you've seen on these

443
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:58,120
tests and I've seen and I've seen some

444
00:19:53,769 --> 00:20:02,200
pretty high salt levels that still are

445
00:19:58,119 --> 00:20:03,909
very productive soils cannabis soils and

446
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,200
and vegetable soils because we do have

447
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:08,620
some growers using our souls and

448
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:11,529
vegetables and that's something I want

449
00:20:08,619 --> 00:20:13,989
to talk about definitely but in terms of

450
00:20:11,529 --> 00:20:17,740
this idea of using you know essentially

451
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:20,529
a teaspoon of material as our basis for

452
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:23,140
a soil test and then taking that

453
00:20:20,529 --> 00:20:25,000
teaspoon and then calculating out an

454
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:27,660
exchange capacity that really doesn't

455
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,799
represent it

456
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:31,509
because there's a lot of consultants out

457
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:32,599
there making recommendations off of

458
00:20:31,509 --> 00:20:35,279
these

459
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:37,230
using that exchange capacity and using

460
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:38,940
these numbers and then there's a lot of

461
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:41,160
growers honestly using these tests and

462
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:43,019
saying that you know making their soil

463
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:46,230
decisions based off of these tests and

464
00:20:43,019 --> 00:20:50,160
they're balancing you know how much just

465
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:53,430
in a broad sweep do you feel like this

466
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:55,620
is a tool that you use in evaluating a

467
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:57,090
soil so obviously there's you know the

468
00:20:55,619 --> 00:20:59,039
physical properties of the soil there's

469
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:01,289
the biological properties there's the

470
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:03,539
chemical when we talk about nutrient

471
00:21:01,289 --> 00:21:07,349
values where do you think the soil tests

472
00:21:03,539 --> 00:21:09,930
fall in terms of like how much can you

473
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:12,389
really trust them when you when you're

474
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:15,480
making decisions about a soil mix like

475
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:17,610
this on a modified mix I don't think you

476
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:21,329
can and I don't I don't really think

477
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:23,189
that I think that in a modified mix all

478
00:21:21,329 --> 00:21:27,710
the desired values should be pulled off

479
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:27,710
that you should set your own own

480
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:35,640
sufficiency levels for these mixes okay

481
00:21:31,829 --> 00:21:36,829
and and and not and not try to have them

482
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:39,990
set up

483
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:42,389
on a base a duration like you would a

484
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:44,250
standard soil I mean when you when you

485
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:46,080
look at these and you're right I mean

486
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:47,869
there's there's there can be some big

487
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:51,269
variability

488
00:21:47,869 --> 00:21:53,099
but even if you go to a bigger scoop I'm

489
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:55,829
not sure that's going to solve the

490
00:21:53,099 --> 00:21:58,289
problem it's just it's just an inherent

491
00:21:55,829 --> 00:22:00,710
problem with it with the test if you've

492
00:21:58,289 --> 00:22:03,180
got a lot of chunk material in there and

493
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:05,309
some people say why don't you grind

494
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:06,990
those samples well then you're going to

495
00:22:05,309 --> 00:22:09,559
grind some of those minerals out and

496
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:12,240
make them more available too so

497
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:15,500
you know I think the thing to do is to

498
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:18,329
realize that the TECs are not correct

499
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:21,809
I'm like I'm going to continue to use

500
00:22:18,329 --> 00:22:24,349
them as an easy number but I think you

501
00:22:21,809 --> 00:22:27,059
should you should set up

502
00:22:24,349 --> 00:22:31,980
sufficiency levels of your calcium your

503
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:34,730
magnesium and and go with those numbers

504
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:37,410
and not try to try to let the

505
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:39,170
let these desired values determine how

506
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:44,110
you're going to fertilize

507
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:46,480
but because I tip I we see if you go to

508
00:22:44,109 --> 00:22:50,740
for potassium you know if you get you

509
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:52,990
get up there much over 4% I see a lot of

510
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:55,150
potassium does not hold on to the

511
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:57,390
organic traction at all I mean you just

512
00:22:55,150 --> 00:23:01,298
it just it just seems to pass right into

513
00:22:57,390 --> 00:23:05,259
solubility for the most part so I mean

514
00:23:01,298 --> 00:23:07,569
you get up there much about 4% then we

515
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:10,869
start seeing a lot of potassium in the

516
00:23:07,569 --> 00:23:13,349
pace test yeah that's interesting so how

517
00:23:10,869 --> 00:23:17,259
do you feel about trusting the base

518
00:23:13,349 --> 00:23:18,990
saturation percentages as part of this

519
00:23:17,259 --> 00:23:24,220
test

520
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:26,349
well I wouldn't I wouldn't be you know

521
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:31,089
I'm not looking at those all that much

522
00:23:26,349 --> 00:23:34,779
because the on setting desired values so

523
00:23:31,089 --> 00:23:37,839
I mean specific setting specific values

524
00:23:34,779 --> 00:23:40,619
that I want using using more of a slant

525
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:43,678
approach than an Albrecht balanced

526
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:46,899
okay so you're saying I want to see this

527
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:48,940
ppm for sulfur phosphorus calcium and

528
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:52,000
you've kind of set those values that way

529
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:55,390
you think is optimal for a particular

530
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,789
problem right right and then then I by

531
00:23:55,390 --> 00:24:00,490
looking and looking at those and say

532
00:23:57,789 --> 00:24:02,319
okay well at least I have those showing

533
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:04,480
up in the mix and then then turn around

534
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:07,839
look at the pace and see well are they

535
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:09,970
are they moving into solution so you

536
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:13,359
know it's a combination of things not

537
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:17,640
just I think if you if you use this soil

538
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:21,119
test or any any soil test like this

539
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:23,790
on a modified mix without using a paste

540
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:27,879
it's a crapshoot

541
00:24:23,789 --> 00:24:29,950
so I've been doing this now for five or

542
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:31,360
six years trying to better understand

543
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:34,090
these soil tests and all admit I have a

544
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:35,939
lot to learn and it sounds like a lot of

545
00:24:34,089 --> 00:24:38,829
what I was understanding around them was

546
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:40,480
frankly incorrect so this has been

547
00:24:38,829 --> 00:24:43,569
really eye-opening for me in the last

548
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:47,919
couple weeks but I've what I've always

549
00:24:43,569 --> 00:24:50,710
struggled with using these the the the

550
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:54,009
values found in terms of exchangeable

551
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:55,660
cations and so I've just been looking at

552
00:24:54,009 --> 00:24:58,059
base I've been skipping straight to base

553
00:24:55,660 --> 00:25:00,670
saturation percentages and what the

554
00:24:58,059 --> 00:25:02,049
trend I've seen is that when for example

555
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:06,310
you mentioned potassium when I see

556
00:25:02,049 --> 00:25:08,490
potassium dropped below 5% I get grower

557
00:25:06,309 --> 00:25:11,379
reported

558
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:14,500
you know smaller buds and what appears

559
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:16,030
to be potassium deficiencies and one

560
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:17,589
that one other trend I noticed which

561
00:25:16,029 --> 00:25:19,170
makes a lot of sense because these are

562
00:25:17,589 --> 00:25:21,490
fairly weak

563
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:23,740
ions they move through the soil faster

564
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:26,049
as potassium and nitrogen seemed to be

565
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:28,480
used up by the plant or by people's

566
00:25:26,049 --> 00:25:31,210
watering habits you know much faster

567
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:34,029
than any of the the other nutrients in

568
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:36,309
the soil and so typically when i

569
00:25:34,029 --> 00:25:37,960
reinvent i find i'm not adding like this

570
00:25:36,309 --> 00:25:39,879
mix right here that we're looking at

571
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:41,819
i'll find that the the calcium and

572
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:44,350
magnesium values will still stay fairly

573
00:25:41,819 --> 00:25:47,049
similar to where they are now but my my

574
00:25:44,349 --> 00:25:50,259
potassium levels will drop quite a bit

575
00:25:47,049 --> 00:25:51,430
as well as my nitrogen levels even with

576
00:25:50,259 --> 00:25:53,680
people that are watering with no

577
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:56,700
literally no runoff so those are the

578
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:58,570
things that I've been kind of keyed to

579
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:00,120
looking at these tests but I'd be

580
00:25:58,569 --> 00:26:05,439
curious what your thoughts are on that

581
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:07,529
cool yeah I think no 8% that seems that

582
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,600
seems high to me

583
00:26:07,529 --> 00:26:12,639
the cut but then again when you look at

584
00:26:10,599 --> 00:26:15,849
these numbers you do have to look at

585
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:17,800
them in comparison to each other so I

586
00:26:15,849 --> 00:26:19,959
mean when you're looking at this test

587
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:22,779
that we're looking at right now I mean

588
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:26,279
we found almost 2200 pounds of calcium

589
00:26:22,779 --> 00:26:29,519
which is a which is a double charge

590
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:33,940
against the 500 pounds of

591
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:36,069
potassium so you know there there is

592
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:38,710
something to be said for the balance the

593
00:26:36,069 --> 00:26:40,539
question might be well or do we have too

594
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:42,960
much calcium in there that that's

595
00:26:40,539 --> 00:26:45,420
blocking potassium uptake

596
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:50,140
I'm not sure

597
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:53,410
and you know is it I just I see the you

598
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:54,820
know soluble salts thing that you you've

599
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:58,480
said you've seen some really good

600
00:26:54,819 --> 00:26:59,129
results with salts you know up to 2000

601
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,990
and

602
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:04,870
that

603
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:06,880
that's kind of intriguing to me so but

604
00:27:04,869 --> 00:27:10,929
yeah I think I think you have to look at

605
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:14,200
some some some relationships here but

606
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:17,710
are we are we just too high and one and

607
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:21,160
and when you look at potassium again

608
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:24,850
it's not held in its moves into solution

609
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:26,830
pretty quick and certainly potassium is

610
00:27:24,849 --> 00:27:32,669
one of those nutrients that tends to be

611
00:27:26,829 --> 00:27:32,669
get tends to be luxury consumed so

612
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:39,250
you know I'm like you I there's a lot to

613
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:41,619
learn on this thing and especially when

614
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:44,430
when you're coming from a soil to it to

615
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:46,959
a soilless mix

616
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:49,420
nutrient relationships is even more

617
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,819
critical because there's no stability in

618
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:53,350
the mix

619
00:27:50,819 --> 00:27:55,419
so when you talk about nutrient

620
00:27:53,349 --> 00:27:57,730
relationships you know you're talking

621
00:27:55,420 --> 00:28:00,490
about essentially mineral balancing

622
00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:02,559
which was founded by started by William

623
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:04,240
Albrecht as far as I know and then a lot

624
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:05,950
of people have gone off and come up with

625
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,900
different you know slightly different

626
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:09,370
bass saturation percentages but looking

627
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:12,759
at the relationship between all these

628
00:28:09,369 --> 00:28:14,079
minerals and frankly for me the

629
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:16,690
confusing part like when we talk about

630
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:18,460
that like Albrecht loves a 68 12

631
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:21,039
relationship between calcium and

632
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:22,630
magnesium that was sort of his level if

633
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:26,170
I remember correctly but some people

634
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:27,790
like tensions have gone upwards of 90% I

635
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:29,259
believe and then people like Arden

636
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:31,839
Anderson will say you can't get enough

637
00:28:29,259 --> 00:28:35,079
gypsum in the soil it seems like so

638
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:36,669
they're all for a lot of calcium you

639
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:38,889
know that's the big driver when we talk

640
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:40,710
about agricultural soils I mean what are

641
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:44,500
your thoughts on that well

642
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:48,150
I think I think the the actual numbers

643
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:50,680
that Albrecht settled on was 65 and 15

644
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:53,860
and then there was there was some later

645
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:57,279
research that that that said well you

646
00:28:53,859 --> 00:28:59,459
could go to 70 and 10 and and then 68

647
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:01,319
and 12 came up but

648
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:04,690
you know I

649
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:07,000
those getting into that perspective

650
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:09,750
there I think is what what you have to

651
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:13,930
look at not necessarily

652
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:15,910
is it 65 hours at 68 you know that's

653
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:19,000
that's you're trying to split hairs

654
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:22,720
there but the other thing is when you

655
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:25,720
when you look at this soil and and you

656
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:28,288
see that it's a Maalik extraction and

657
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:30,990
it's and it's dissolved stuff

658
00:29:28,288 --> 00:29:35,379
that's not

659
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:37,169
it's it's I mean them I don't I want to

660
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:40,900
say that

661
00:29:37,169 --> 00:29:42,820
you know it's been dissolved but it

662
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:45,400
doesn't necessarily mean that it is

663
00:29:42,819 --> 00:29:49,599
plant available at that at that point in

664
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:54,210
time so so looking again looking at the

665
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:57,209
whole test on a modified mix you

666
00:29:54,210 --> 00:30:00,038
must be really careful I

667
00:29:57,210 --> 00:30:04,179
don't know however I'll better to talk

668
00:30:00,038 --> 00:30:06,069
to say it but no I think that's good for

669
00:30:04,179 --> 00:30:07,509
me what I try and tell people is the

670
00:30:06,069 --> 00:30:10,210
soil test is sort of it's a tool just

671
00:30:07,509 --> 00:30:11,740
like a rake or a shovel or any or a

672
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:14,409
tractor or anything else you might have

673
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:15,940
in your repertoire but ultimately we're

674
00:30:14,409 --> 00:30:18,190
not going for the perfect soil test

675
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:20,980
we're going for plant health and plant

676
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:23,679
plant growth your yield so at the end of

677
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:26,200
the day that's our metric it's not it's

678
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:28,059
not a soil test it's you know how is our

679
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:30,149
plant look and what are we yielding off

680
00:30:28,058 --> 00:30:34,960
of this crop that's really what matters

681
00:30:30,148 --> 00:30:38,648
yes and and that's why I say is the

682
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:42,220
taste test becomes the main tool here

683
00:30:38,648 --> 00:30:45,099
because that is that's a water

684
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:46,980
extractable solution and that's what the

685
00:30:45,099 --> 00:30:49,298
plants are see

686
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:52,028
so could we talk a little bit about the

687
00:30:49,298 --> 00:30:55,658
pay's test can you talk about what how a

688
00:30:52,028 --> 00:30:57,759
pastéis is is processed by the lab what

689
00:30:55,659 --> 00:31:01,450
they're doing and then what what these

690
00:30:57,759 --> 00:31:04,028
numbers kind of kind of mean yeah they

691
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:08,319
they tend they take the the sample that

692
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:10,269
you have and I believe they're used in

693
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:12,819
some place between two and four hundred

694
00:31:10,269 --> 00:31:16,359
I think the lab uses two hundred but

695
00:31:12,819 --> 00:31:18,450
some of the original research would use

696
00:31:16,359 --> 00:31:20,949
four hundred grams but

697
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:23,259
again we're also striving for

698
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:26,470
consistency and so as long as you it can

699
00:31:23,259 --> 00:31:29,319
stay consistent so but so the lab takes

700
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:31,649
200 grams versus maybe five grams that

701
00:31:29,319 --> 00:31:34,629
they would use for melech

702
00:31:31,648 --> 00:31:36,398
so they'll take that 200 grams they they

703
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:38,710
bring that up to kind of a patent

704
00:31:36,398 --> 00:31:42,469
pancake batter can

705
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:44,720
and they leave that set for 24 hours

706
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:47,140
then they vacuum that water off and then

707
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:49,490
run it through the ICP

708
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:55,330
just like they've run the extracting

709
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:58,430
solution on the Malick so so once that

710
00:31:55,329 --> 00:32:00,829
soil has set for 24 hours they vacuum

711
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:02,960
off and then then we're getting that's

712
00:32:00,829 --> 00:32:06,349
how we're getting the data here for the

713
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:11,230
for the pace test now soluble salts

714
00:32:06,349 --> 00:32:14,949
they'll use a meter in the in the mix

715
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:18,200
before it's vacuumed off and

716
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:22,090
and then they'll measure measure the by

717
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:22,090
carbs and the chlorides in there too so

718
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:27,740
it's the data it collected it's pretty

719
00:32:25,339 --> 00:32:29,689
much the same as on on the standard test

720
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:31,480
with the exception of bicarb soluble

721
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:34,870
salts and chlorides

722
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:37,849
but it's it's an all water soluble

723
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:40,159
situation so and when you when you look

724
00:32:37,849 --> 00:32:42,429
at some of the data I think it was

725
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:45,590
Barbara and Olson

726
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:49,029
where they're showing that most of the

727
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:53,990
nutrient uptake with the exception of

728
00:32:49,029 --> 00:32:56,660
copper and about 50% of the iron is is

729
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:58,000
taken up by by mass flow and diffusion

730
00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:01,910
that is

731
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:04,309
nutrients in solution so the concept

732
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:07,670
here is that the pace saturated pace

733
00:33:04,309 --> 00:33:10,609
test is it's essentially they're taking

734
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:13,430
the soil putting it in water that's

735
00:33:10,609 --> 00:33:16,750
really neutral and then just whatever

736
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:19,970
seeps out essentially into solution is

737
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:22,779
is what shows up on the test and that is

738
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:26,150
in theory what is plant available

739
00:33:22,779 --> 00:33:28,220
yeah so it's it's not it's not a strong

740
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:30,290
extraction like we had with the standard

741
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:32,839
which is an acid that's going to pull

742
00:33:30,289 --> 00:33:34,490
more nutrients out but really just

743
00:33:32,839 --> 00:33:35,720
what's what's available to the plant in

744
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:38,180
theory that that's the correlation

745
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:41,569
they're going for correct right and

746
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:44,000
you're if you're looking at the the DI

747
00:33:41,569 --> 00:33:47,149
waters what's what's typically used and

748
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,910
it's right there close to seven you know

749
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:51,410
you look at rainwater today it's about

750
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:53,769
six six

751
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:55,480
I've tested it at

752
00:33:53,769 --> 00:33:58,299
certainly a

753
00:33:55,480 --> 00:34:02,509
lot higher than what it used to be and

754
00:33:58,299 --> 00:34:04,970
so when you're looking at the DI water

755
00:34:02,509 --> 00:34:07,750
extraction it's very similar to what you

756
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:11,210
would get with rain water and

757
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:14,840
but we've also used we've had people use

758
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:19,010
their their water as the extracting

759
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:21,019
solution so you know you can go to

760
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:23,540
different ways to lab we'll take your

761
00:34:21,019 --> 00:34:24,699
water and use it as the extracting

762
00:34:23,539 --> 00:34:26,869
solution

763
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:28,009
that's that's really interesting because

764
00:34:26,869 --> 00:34:29,449
that's gonna obviously give you

765
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:31,460
different values and I think it's

766
00:34:29,449 --> 00:34:33,789
important that people test their water I

767
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:36,918
just want to highlight that because a

768
00:34:33,789 --> 00:34:39,289
lot of times I'll see buildup of certain

769
00:34:36,918 --> 00:34:41,960
things and a lot like this usually it's

770
00:34:39,289 --> 00:34:43,699
the pH will continue to rise or sodium

771
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:45,400
or calcium will continue to rise and a

772
00:34:43,699 --> 00:34:47,839
lot of it is tied back to their water

773
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:51,079
when we start talking about successive

774
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:53,780
cycles in this type of media so I just

775
00:34:51,079 --> 00:34:55,279
want to encourage listeners again to to

776
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:58,280
please test their water it's not that

777
00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:00,280
expensive and those values are really

778
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:03,140
that's really valuable information

779
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:04,610
yeah let me say one thing about the

780
00:35:03,139 --> 00:35:06,529
waters I know you didn't that's not

781
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:10,280
exactly what we wanted to do today but

782
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:13,550
one of the things that you can look at a

783
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:15,440
water test and you can say based on the

784
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:17,500
parameters that are out there is they'll

785
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:21,440
say well that's a pretty good water

786
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:23,590
but as a as a soil guy I want to know

787
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:26,570
what the effect of that water

788
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:28,820
accumulation of nutrients will be on

789
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:31,820
that soil after four or five irrigation

790
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:36,309
cycles and when you look at the balance

791
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:39,289
of the of the nutrients in the water

792
00:35:36,309 --> 00:35:41,630
after four or five irrigation cycles

793
00:35:39,289 --> 00:35:44,029
there's a lot of times it will start to

794
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:46,280
look your pace test will start to look

795
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:48,490
more like the water test at it than it

796
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:51,380
did originally so

797
00:35:48,489 --> 00:35:52,789
what about you know I know we weren't

798
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:55,369
talking about water but I think this is

799
00:35:52,789 --> 00:35:58,009
important we've had a lot of people

800
00:35:55,369 --> 00:36:00,769
having good success by pH pH Inge their

801
00:35:58,010 --> 00:36:02,630
watered down to sixty five I know

802
00:36:00,769 --> 00:36:04,750
Michael at main craft cannabis claims

803
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:06,640
that he got you and better growth by

804
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:09,880
going down to five five with his water

805
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:11,319
using phosphoric acid instead of citric

806
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:14,920
acid do you have any thoughts regarding

807
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:17,289
you know pH in your water like this no I

808
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:18,820
think I think he's probably I think when

809
00:36:17,289 --> 00:36:19,889
you get I think you're getting down to

810
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:24,039
the bottom

811
00:36:19,889 --> 00:36:27,150
well at five five is certainly in a

812
00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:29,670
modified mix where you're not looking at

813
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:31,960
maybe the

814
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:33,880
biological activity like you would in a

815
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:36,970
soil I think when you start getting down

816
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:39,970
to five five in a in a standard soil I

817
00:36:36,969 --> 00:36:41,129
think you start shifting the biology

818
00:36:39,969 --> 00:36:45,549
maybe

819
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:49,090
in the refraction but I certainly have I

820
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:53,670
see better better availability at five

821
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:57,180
eight two six two on on the PHS

822
00:36:53,670 --> 00:37:00,159
than I do even at six eight

823
00:36:57,179 --> 00:37:02,469
see it's funny because most of our soils

824
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:04,118
six eight is probably the lowest I've

825
00:37:02,469 --> 00:37:05,559
seen we tend to be a little bit higher

826
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:07,840
even though we're using a lot of peat

827
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:11,519
moss and due to the amount of nutrients

828
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:13,150
you know cations and alkaline alkaline

829
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:14,949
amendments that we're using because

830
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:16,050
we're using biochar which is fairly

831
00:37:14,949 --> 00:37:19,059
alkaline

832
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:22,180
we're using you know compost we're

833
00:37:19,059 --> 00:37:25,449
adding in a lot of cations and nutrients

834
00:37:22,179 --> 00:37:30,159
so our souls to run more with more

835
00:37:25,449 --> 00:37:31,750
alkaline than acidic and yet they seem

836
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:34,299
to perform pretty well when we talk

837
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:36,909
about you know plant growth and plant

838
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:39,010
health the plant a lot of organic

839
00:37:36,909 --> 00:37:41,079
growers say you know you can throw away

840
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:44,320
your pH pen or your pH meter which I

841
00:37:41,079 --> 00:37:46,210
don't agree with and I do see results it

842
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:49,630
does appear to that we're getting better

843
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:51,840
results by pH in the water down but the

844
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:55,300
research I read is that you really can't

845
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:57,720
impact your overall you know media pH

846
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:59,980
all that dramatically by

847
00:37:57,719 --> 00:38:02,618
by watering especially with something

848
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:04,420
like citric acid that's such a weak has

849
00:38:02,619 --> 00:38:05,740
such weak buffering capacity like how

850
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:07,780
what's the what do you think the ability

851
00:38:05,739 --> 00:38:11,129
of the water is to really lower your pH

852
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:15,400
over time in your in your soilless media

853
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:18,579
well I think I think Lauren at pH down

854
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:20,430
to that six five five or six two or

855
00:38:18,579 --> 00:38:22,329
wherever you want it

856
00:38:20,429 --> 00:38:25,049
basically what you're trying to do is

857
00:38:22,329 --> 00:38:28,810
you're mainly getting rid of bicarbonate

858
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:32,619
your burning off bicarbonate so which

859
00:38:28,809 --> 00:38:34,869
has a huge impact on calcium and then as

860
00:38:32,619 --> 00:38:37,088
soils dry down it will precipitate out

861
00:38:34,869 --> 00:38:39,160
calcium and then that will precipitate

862
00:38:37,088 --> 00:38:42,940
that washer so you get that domino

863
00:38:39,159 --> 00:38:46,779
effect but the the other thing about pH

864
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:48,880
is when you look at at some of these

865
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:51,210
mixes and let's just take a take a look

866
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:54,059
at the one here we got in front of us

867
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:57,130
the pH is 6.8

868
00:38:54,059 --> 00:38:59,078
well when when we're measuring pH what

869
00:38:57,130 --> 00:39:01,750
are we measuring we're measuring

870
00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:05,170
hydrogen and so when you start having

871
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:08,139
these salts up here this high that tends

872
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:10,980
to block the amount of hydrogen ions

873
00:39:08,139 --> 00:39:14,618
that can get to that to that sensor

874
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:16,539
so you're tending to dilute hydrogen the

875
00:39:14,619 --> 00:39:20,430
height you can have you could still have

876
00:39:16,539 --> 00:39:23,079
the same amount of hydrogen ions but

877
00:39:20,429 --> 00:39:24,639
because of the higher salts content in

878
00:39:23,079 --> 00:39:27,579
the water it tends to block that

879
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:30,639
hydrogen through that through the the

880
00:39:27,579 --> 00:39:33,818
meter and you know salts typically

881
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:36,429
they're supposed to be pH neutral so you

882
00:39:33,818 --> 00:39:39,338
put a put a potassium chloride or

883
00:39:36,429 --> 00:39:41,019
potassium sulfate those that's a strong

884
00:39:39,338 --> 00:39:43,509
acid strong base they're not really

885
00:39:41,019 --> 00:39:45,730
supposed to change the pH and they

886
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:49,119
probably won't change the hydrogen ion

887
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:51,670
concentrations but I'm telling you that

888
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:54,599
that we will see increases in the pH

889
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:57,579
just because of salts concentration

890
00:39:54,599 --> 00:40:01,809
so how concerning is that when we see a

891
00:39:57,579 --> 00:40:03,130
pH that's you know above 7 or you know

892
00:40:01,809 --> 00:40:06,099
this is where you're getting a little

893
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:08,140
out of my to a comfort comfort zone here

894
00:40:06,099 --> 00:40:09,880
when you start talking about this

895
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:12,009
testing method so are you saying that

896
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:14,338
this pH number may or may not be

897
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:18,310
completely accurate

898
00:40:14,338 --> 00:40:20,619
I'm saying it can be if you could

899
00:40:18,309 --> 00:40:22,739
actually have it could be masked a

900
00:40:20,619 --> 00:40:25,269
little bit by the salt concentration yes

901
00:40:22,739 --> 00:40:28,269
so it could be in theory lower than it

902
00:40:25,269 --> 00:40:30,730
actually shows on the test yeah higher

903
00:40:28,269 --> 00:40:32,739
lower okay that makes more sense to me

904
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:34,478
because you get a ph availability chart

905
00:40:32,739 --> 00:40:36,789
and i'll try and put one up on the

906
00:40:34,478 --> 00:40:38,438
podcast page as well and you can see

907
00:40:36,789 --> 00:40:41,469
that a lot of the nutrients that we want

908
00:40:38,438 --> 00:40:43,298
for plant health are more available at

909
00:40:41,469 --> 00:40:44,588
lower PHS and we want to be careful

910
00:40:43,298 --> 00:40:46,208
there too because we start getting too

911
00:40:44,588 --> 00:40:48,268
low and we're gonna get into territory

912
00:40:46,208 --> 00:40:50,858
where some of these heavy metals or more

913
00:40:48,268 --> 00:40:53,428
easily uptake in and that can get

914
00:40:50,858 --> 00:40:56,259
dangerous for people in regards to the

915
00:40:53,429 --> 00:40:58,749
passing heavy-metal testing with their

916
00:40:56,259 --> 00:41:00,519
soil mixes but the ranges we're talkin

917
00:40:58,748 --> 00:41:01,648
are plenty high for aluminum and things

918
00:41:00,518 --> 00:41:03,908
but

919
00:41:01,648 --> 00:41:05,338
that's really that's really really

920
00:41:03,909 --> 00:41:08,169
interesting so

921
00:41:05,338 --> 00:41:10,989
this pH number may not what you're

922
00:41:08,168 --> 00:41:14,379
saying is it may report on these tests

923
00:41:10,989 --> 00:41:16,208
higher than it is in reality yeah

924
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:18,068
because of the salts because of the

925
00:41:16,208 --> 00:41:20,469
salts now the other thing is when you

926
00:41:18,068 --> 00:41:21,929
look at a pH chart like you were talking

927
00:41:20,469 --> 00:41:24,969
about

928
00:41:21,929 --> 00:41:26,039
remember that that is a static

929
00:41:24,969 --> 00:41:31,449
environment

930
00:41:26,039 --> 00:41:34,289
so you can look at if you look at one of

931
00:41:31,449 --> 00:41:38,979
those you look at a calcium on

932
00:41:34,289 --> 00:41:41,759
pH at five and you say oh my calcium is

933
00:41:38,978 --> 00:41:44,228
not very available but I can show you

934
00:41:41,759 --> 00:41:46,498
solubility tests that there's plenty of

935
00:41:44,228 --> 00:41:50,588
calcium available

936
00:41:46,498 --> 00:41:53,558
what what those pH tests are saying that

937
00:41:50,588 --> 00:41:54,838
if you're looking at a regular soil and

938
00:41:53,559 --> 00:41:57,939
you've got a

939
00:41:54,838 --> 00:42:02,438
this is a soil that's not that hasn't

940
00:41:57,938 --> 00:42:05,588
been modified or changed very much if

941
00:42:02,438 --> 00:42:07,808
you got a pH of five the odds are very

942
00:42:05,588 --> 00:42:09,389
good that you the calcium has been

943
00:42:07,809 --> 00:42:12,759
leached out of it

944
00:42:09,389 --> 00:42:15,459
sure but that makes sense so so those

945
00:42:12,759 --> 00:42:18,728
when you look at those charts remember

946
00:42:15,458 --> 00:42:23,048
that is a that is look trying to say if

947
00:42:18,728 --> 00:42:25,118
this soil is is a virgin soil at pH 7

948
00:42:23,048 --> 00:42:27,248
well the odds are there's more calcium

949
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:29,969
or more magnesium or potassium there's

950
00:42:27,248 --> 00:42:32,678
more cations there but

951
00:42:29,969 --> 00:42:35,639
that doesn't necessarily mean just

952
00:42:32,679 --> 00:42:39,099
because you have a pH of

953
00:42:35,639 --> 00:42:42,489
5 5 or 5 9 that you don't have enough

954
00:42:39,099 --> 00:42:47,528
calcium well when we used to look at

955
00:42:42,489 --> 00:42:50,259
rain water that was pH 5 5 we saw when

956
00:42:47,528 --> 00:42:53,889
we got a rain we got a real bump in the

957
00:42:50,259 --> 00:42:57,659
in the crop response now at six six we

958
00:42:53,889 --> 00:42:57,659
don't so

959
00:42:57,690 --> 00:43:03,750
those those pH charts are great but

960
00:43:01,358 --> 00:43:05,400
there that that is a

961
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:08,230
static

962
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:11,039
static environment that that you have to

963
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:14,858
look at in perspective on those

964
00:43:11,039 --> 00:43:16,630
so my takeaway would be from this is

965
00:43:14,858 --> 00:43:19,869
that when we look at these numbers - the

966
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:22,240
other thing to consider is our soil is

967
00:43:19,869 --> 00:43:24,548
not just this nutrient solution there

968
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:26,889
are all these different micro pores of

969
00:43:24,548 --> 00:43:28,389
aerobic and anaerobic activity we know

970
00:43:26,889 --> 00:43:30,879
that just from the biology we're seeing

971
00:43:28,389 --> 00:43:32,679
the pH is not the same across all of

972
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,599
these areas you have a lot of different

973
00:43:32,679 --> 00:43:37,118
interactions going on frankly most of

974
00:43:34,599 --> 00:43:38,818
them we don't fully understand but

975
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:41,500
there's a lot of like

976
00:43:38,818 --> 00:43:44,349
biological pockets that are gonna impact

977
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:47,018
and change the pH right there in there

978
00:43:44,349 --> 00:43:49,298
in that area and so this just gives us a

979
00:43:47,018 --> 00:43:51,338
general I think idea of where we're at

980
00:43:49,298 --> 00:43:52,900
but not really like you said it's it's

981
00:43:51,338 --> 00:43:54,038
not it doesn't mean that certain

982
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:56,108
nutrients are going to be completely

983
00:43:54,039 --> 00:43:58,119
unavailable and you can't totally use

984
00:43:56,108 --> 00:44:02,130
that chart it sounds like as a way of

985
00:43:58,119 --> 00:44:04,990
evaluating a soil right right

986
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:08,200
so I mean just just because you have a

987
00:44:04,989 --> 00:44:11,018
pH of 775 you say oh I'm not gonna have

988
00:44:08,199 --> 00:44:14,368
any phosphorus availability know if that

989
00:44:11,018 --> 00:44:16,989
pH is 75 because of sodium or potassium

990
00:44:14,369 --> 00:44:18,539
both potassium phosphate and sodium

991
00:44:16,989 --> 00:44:24,278
phosphate are

992
00:44:18,539 --> 00:44:26,589
very soluble so I mean it's the factor

993
00:44:24,278 --> 00:44:29,108
that's causing that pH to be high I mean

994
00:44:26,588 --> 00:44:31,500
calcium there when you talk about some

995
00:44:29,108 --> 00:44:34,389
guys modifying their water with

996
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:35,889
phosphoric acid if you got much calcium

997
00:44:34,389 --> 00:44:37,268
in there that's gonna be a problem

998
00:44:35,889 --> 00:44:39,538
because you're gonna precipitate that

999
00:44:37,268 --> 00:44:41,068
out

1000
00:44:39,539 --> 00:44:43,900
so

1001
00:44:41,068 --> 00:44:46,449
why would that necessarily be a bad

1002
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:47,190
thing if the calcium precipitates if we

1003
00:44:46,449 --> 00:44:49,288
have

1004
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:53,099
too much of it

1005
00:44:49,289 --> 00:44:56,259
because I did that one time and we had a

1006
00:44:53,099 --> 00:44:59,140
well water that we put phosphoric acid

1007
00:44:56,259 --> 00:45:00,329
in and with the drip irrigation it got

1008
00:44:59,139 --> 00:45:03,039
the nozzles

1009
00:45:00,329 --> 00:45:05,348
okay okay so that's the issue with

1010
00:45:03,039 --> 00:45:07,269
precipitation is yeah they could clog

1011
00:45:05,349 --> 00:45:09,088
irrigation are there any other issues in

1012
00:45:07,269 --> 00:45:12,460
terms of the soil itself

1013
00:45:09,088 --> 00:45:14,980
over time no what man no I I don't I

1014
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:17,139
don't think so it is once you start if

1015
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:19,269
you overdo it and you get too much

1016
00:45:17,139 --> 00:45:22,269
phosphorus in there that you know

1017
00:45:19,269 --> 00:45:24,509
phosphorus really ties up zinc so that

1018
00:45:22,269 --> 00:45:27,429
that can be an issue

1019
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:29,200
can we look at the saturated pace test a

1020
00:45:27,429 --> 00:45:30,579
little bit closer and can you talk so

1021
00:45:29,199 --> 00:45:32,799
we've talked a little bit about salt

1022
00:45:30,579 --> 00:45:35,559
soluble salts but I think those three

1023
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:37,060
things are really confusing to to

1024
00:45:35,559 --> 00:45:38,679
growers in general and when we talk

1025
00:45:37,059 --> 00:45:40,210
about soluble salts chloride and

1026
00:45:38,679 --> 00:45:41,649
bicarbonate those those three numbers

1027
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:43,809
right there can you talk a little bit

1028
00:45:41,650 --> 00:45:47,170
about what those are and how to kind of

1029
00:45:43,809 --> 00:45:49,630
evaluate them in your eyes well soluble

1030
00:45:47,170 --> 00:45:51,070
salts when I talk to a lot of people

1031
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:54,910
they're saying well I don't think my

1032
00:45:51,070 --> 00:45:57,880
sodium is that high sir if the salt is

1033
00:45:54,909 --> 00:46:00,429
all the cations and anions combination

1034
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:02,010
so that's you know that's ammonia that's

1035
00:46:00,429 --> 00:46:05,230
nitrate that

1036
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:07,599
sulfur calcium magnesium potassium

1037
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:11,309
phosphorus all those things are thrown

1038
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:14,470
into the soluble salts and so

1039
00:46:11,309 --> 00:46:17,980
you know it's what happens is when the

1040
00:46:14,469 --> 00:46:21,098
soluble salts get too high then it it

1041
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:22,900
causes the plants to have to expend

1042
00:46:21,099 --> 00:46:24,670
energy they better have better

1043
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:27,309
phosphorous numbers if the salts are

1044
00:46:24,670 --> 00:46:29,559
high because that plant has to expend

1045
00:46:27,309 --> 00:46:31,630
energy to pull water in where the

1046
00:46:29,559 --> 00:46:33,519
tendency is if the concentration of

1047
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:35,920
salts are higher on the outside of the

1048
00:46:33,519 --> 00:46:39,269
root then it wants to pull freshwater

1049
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:43,389
back away from the roots so

1050
00:46:39,269 --> 00:46:46,539
and plants in general they have a wide

1051
00:46:43,389 --> 00:46:50,440
range in which they can operate in the

1052
00:46:46,539 --> 00:46:52,088
in the salts so I mean I look at it I

1053
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:55,750
really don't like to have salts over

1054
00:46:52,088 --> 00:46:58,059
over 1200 but you're you're saying that

1055
00:46:55,750 --> 00:47:01,150
you're very successful at that well I'm

1056
00:46:58,059 --> 00:47:02,219
not going to disagree that you may it's

1057
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:06,579
just

1058
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:08,799
I'm not sure I mean I look at these

1059
00:47:06,579 --> 00:47:10,509
numbers here and I think you know to me

1060
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:14,420
these numbers are on the high side but

1061
00:47:10,510 --> 00:47:18,060
you're successful at that and and so

1062
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:20,670
well I think one of the other things too

1063
00:47:18,059 --> 00:47:22,860
and we're talking about soluble salts

1064
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:25,920
and I've had guys I've seen numbers

1065
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:28,200
3,000 4,000 5,000 on these that they

1066
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:31,380
claim they still have good healthy

1067
00:47:28,199 --> 00:47:34,139
plants but what what I would say is like

1068
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:35,730
you mentioned regarding water we're

1069
00:47:34,139 --> 00:47:38,639
talking about pretty intensive cropping

1070
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:40,800
so typically there's co2 supplementation

1071
00:47:38,639 --> 00:47:43,889
very high light intensity so there's a

1072
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:45,180
lot of nutrient uptake going on and then

1073
00:47:43,889 --> 00:47:47,250
the big thing there like you mentioned

1074
00:47:45,179 --> 00:47:50,309
with water is irrigation so using an

1075
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:53,099
irrigation system that keeps water

1076
00:47:50,309 --> 00:47:54,779
levels fairly high relative to what you

1077
00:47:53,099 --> 00:47:57,239
would see traditionally outside you know

1078
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:58,950
to where they're either continually

1079
00:47:57,239 --> 00:48:00,569
receiving water like using these blue

1080
00:47:58,949 --> 00:48:02,789
mat systems that we use or people are

1081
00:48:00,570 --> 00:48:05,280
watering every two to three days to keep

1082
00:48:02,789 --> 00:48:07,199
that soil evenly moist I feel like the

1083
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:09,870
the combination of high nutrient uptake

1084
00:48:07,199 --> 00:48:12,599
and biological activity kind of offsets

1085
00:48:09,869 --> 00:48:15,089
some of these soluble salt levels I mean

1086
00:48:12,599 --> 00:48:16,829
what do you think about that no I think

1087
00:48:15,090 --> 00:48:19,500
you're I think you're exactly right

1088
00:48:16,829 --> 00:48:23,389
salts become a problem when when the

1089
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:25,679
soils tend to dry down and and so

1090
00:48:23,389 --> 00:48:28,409
because the salt concentration gets

1091
00:48:25,679 --> 00:48:31,769
higher as the soils dry down so this

1092
00:48:28,409 --> 00:48:33,319
this 1600 if you'd let it go dry might

1093
00:48:31,769 --> 00:48:38,340
might go up to

1094
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:40,769
3,000 okay but so keeping keeping your

1095
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:43,740
you know in the water you're injecting

1096
00:48:40,769 --> 00:48:45,449
into this thing is you know maybe it's

1097
00:48:43,739 --> 00:48:48,599
got a soluble salts of two or three

1098
00:48:45,449 --> 00:48:50,519
hundred so you know you're running that

1099
00:48:48,599 --> 00:48:53,009
dilution down all the time you're adding

1100
00:48:50,519 --> 00:48:56,070
water but if you let if you let it go

1101
00:48:53,010 --> 00:48:57,800
dry then then the concentration really

1102
00:48:56,070 --> 00:49:01,200
gets to be a problem

1103
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:02,970
well and the peat the pizza hydrophobic

1104
00:49:01,199 --> 00:49:06,000
anyway that causes an issue with a lot

1105
00:49:02,969 --> 00:49:07,799
of these potting soils too so yeah it's

1106
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,329
a lose-lose when we talk about letting

1107
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:12,120
these soils dry out I think that's a

1108
00:49:09,329 --> 00:49:14,759
good but I will also tell you that I

1109
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:17,789
think that you can get your salts

1110
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:21,110
numbers to low I mean this salts are

1111
00:49:17,789 --> 00:49:24,929
going to be an indication of nutrient

1112
00:49:21,110 --> 00:49:29,200
concentration so if your salts get down

1113
00:49:24,929 --> 00:49:32,969
there probably and 500 or 400 you might

1114
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:35,889
not have enough nutrients in solution

1115
00:49:32,969 --> 00:49:37,599
that's a really good point yeah and I

1116
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:40,150
think too the other thing to keep in

1117
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:41,710
mind is with these soils the original

1118
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:44,050
concept was that we were doing a

1119
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:45,579
one-time fertigation right at the

1120
00:49:44,050 --> 00:49:47,080
beginning when we mix these soils so

1121
00:49:45,579 --> 00:49:50,170
that people could literally just water

1122
00:49:47,079 --> 00:49:52,299
their plant not continually adding

1123
00:49:50,170 --> 00:49:55,119
nutrients so we have to have higher salt

1124
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:57,039
levels you know there's we could we

1125
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:59,289
could debate about whether or not this

1126
00:49:57,039 --> 00:50:02,199
is too much or what a maximum amount of

1127
00:49:59,289 --> 00:50:04,779
you know soluble nutrients you or

1128
00:50:02,199 --> 00:50:06,879
soluble salt levels is appropriate in a

1129
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:08,320
potting soil but it's you know if you're

1130
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:09,940
trying to go a full cycle they are gonna

1131
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:12,070
have to be higher than say someone who's

1132
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:14,019
applying fertilizer you know every

1133
00:50:12,070 --> 00:50:16,410
watering or weekly or whatever

1134
00:50:14,019 --> 00:50:19,170
application schedule

1135
00:50:16,409 --> 00:50:21,969
exactly and I think I think

1136
00:50:19,170 --> 00:50:24,490
in virtually all these cases that you're

1137
00:50:21,969 --> 00:50:26,609
dealing with or with the cannabis those

1138
00:50:24,489 --> 00:50:29,589
are all transplants

1139
00:50:26,610 --> 00:50:32,140
that you're putting in there starting

1140
00:50:29,590 --> 00:50:34,019
seeds in these kind of salt levels could

1141
00:50:32,139 --> 00:50:36,250
be a real problem I

1142
00:50:34,019 --> 00:50:39,190
totally agree with you I have people

1143
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:40,900
that start seeds in these soils but it's

1144
00:50:39,190 --> 00:50:43,329
not what I would typically recommend I

1145
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:45,070
it seems to work okay they claim but

1146
00:50:43,329 --> 00:50:46,900
again I that doesn't make sense to my

1147
00:50:45,070 --> 00:50:49,960
brain either I I would agree with you on

1148
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:53,579
that yeah and again some of those

1149
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:56,019
depending on the seeds you know I think

1150
00:50:53,579 --> 00:50:57,639
cucumbers or something like that they're

1151
00:50:56,019 --> 00:51:00,389
you know they're not gonna take they're

1152
00:50:57,639 --> 00:51:02,858
not gonna take high salts like

1153
00:51:00,389 --> 00:51:05,589
maybe a tomato will or something I

1154
00:51:02,858 --> 00:51:07,719
there's a real variability on the seeds

1155
00:51:05,590 --> 00:51:09,220
and I I would have to right I'm like I

1156
00:51:07,719 --> 00:51:11,259
can't tell you that exactly what it is

1157
00:51:09,219 --> 00:51:13,750
right now but I do that very

1158
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:15,930
significantly can you talk a little

1159
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:18,190
about chloride next

1160
00:51:15,929 --> 00:51:20,108
role in here because I that's something

1161
00:51:18,190 --> 00:51:22,720
I'm not very strong on so I would love a

1162
00:51:20,108 --> 00:51:24,880
little education on on this well you

1163
00:51:22,719 --> 00:51:28,089
know now we got about two people that

1164
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:29,608
aren't very strong on chloride I you

1165
00:51:28,090 --> 00:51:32,289
know I think that can be a

1166
00:51:29,608 --> 00:51:35,069
chloride certainly has a toxicity a

1167
00:51:32,289 --> 00:51:38,800
lower toxicity level

1168
00:51:35,070 --> 00:51:40,330
much the same maybe it's boron so you

1169
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:43,600
know it's a matter trying to keep that

1170
00:51:40,329 --> 00:51:46,989
chlorides chlorides down because the

1171
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:49,059
toxicity where's that toxicity at that's

1172
00:51:46,989 --> 00:51:51,639
a good question because of all these

1173
00:51:49,059 --> 00:51:55,170
other things that that's entering here

1174
00:51:51,639 --> 00:51:59,170
but you know it might be it might be a

1175
00:51:55,170 --> 00:52:02,050
250-300 toxicity range and it's just

1176
00:51:59,170 --> 00:52:03,450
where you know what's the toxicity range

1177
00:52:02,050 --> 00:52:05,890
for

1178
00:52:03,449 --> 00:52:08,439
soluble salts you know I might go from

1179
00:52:05,889 --> 00:52:11,589
you know might be up there two to three

1180
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:13,920
thousand so it's a lot narrower on

1181
00:52:11,590 --> 00:52:16,200
chlorides than than anything and really

1182
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:18,869
really

1183
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:22,739
bicarbonates are

1184
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:26,909
is a fairly narrow range to

1185
00:52:22,739 --> 00:52:30,039
because of the precipitating effect

1186
00:52:26,909 --> 00:52:33,599
so where where are we picking up

1187
00:52:30,039 --> 00:52:37,480
chloride typically in these mixes

1188
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:40,299
well chlorides chlorides are in a lot of

1189
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:42,630
things when you look at I'm sure there's

1190
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:46,420
a fair amount of chlorides in Pete

1191
00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:49,030
when you look at standard soils you know

1192
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:51,130
that there's there's a fair amount of

1193
00:52:49,030 --> 00:52:52,620
chlorides there I mean we don't measure

1194
00:52:51,130 --> 00:52:57,599
them

1195
00:52:52,619 --> 00:53:00,369
a lot like we do in these mixes here but

1196
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:03,309
you know that's the that's one of the

1197
00:53:00,369 --> 00:53:07,329
anions that balances the cations coming

1198
00:53:03,309 --> 00:53:09,599
in to the to the plant I mean nitrate

1199
00:53:07,329 --> 00:53:11,860
will do that too but

1200
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:14,139
chlorides if you look on tissue

1201
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:16,809
sometimes the chlorides are extremely

1202
00:53:14,139 --> 00:53:20,230
high and that's just the balancing

1203
00:53:16,809 --> 00:53:23,079
cation or anion are we picking it up

1204
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:25,590
from our water source ever Oh certainly

1205
00:53:23,079 --> 00:53:28,840
we can yeah bet yeah

1206
00:53:25,590 --> 00:53:31,420
okay and then moving on to bicarbonate

1207
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:35,309
you mentioned that's a narrow window I

1208
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:38,260
see a lot of it coming in on water tests

1209
00:53:35,309 --> 00:53:40,000
how do we manage bicarbonate levels and

1210
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:42,730
what is that number what's the concern

1211
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:46,650
with bicarbonate in terms of toxicity or

1212
00:53:42,730 --> 00:53:49,840
chloride really - well I mean

1213
00:53:46,650 --> 00:53:53,769
bicarbonate the worry is you get it so

1214
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:56,500
high that again as the soils dry down

1215
00:53:53,769 --> 00:53:59,500
start precipitating out calcium and then

1216
00:53:56,500 --> 00:54:02,469
that domino effect of precipitating out

1217
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:05,139
phosphorus so it becomes less of a

1218
00:54:02,469 --> 00:54:08,009
problem the more you keep the moisture

1219
00:54:05,139 --> 00:54:10,829
there you don't let it go dry

1220
00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:14,230
but

1221
00:54:10,829 --> 00:54:18,509
it's mainly and how you handle this is

1222
00:54:14,230 --> 00:54:21,340
just by acidifying that water so that

1223
00:54:18,510 --> 00:54:23,280
you can burn off those bicarbonate as

1224
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:25,890
carbon dioxide oh

1225
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:29,230
so we can lower it by applying a

1226
00:54:25,889 --> 00:54:32,319
somewhat you know slightly acidic yeah

1227
00:54:29,230 --> 00:54:34,000
water shoots into it okay yeah yeah is

1228
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:36,490
that what we're seeing when we see like

1229
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:38,320
on the edges of fabric pots we'll see

1230
00:54:36,489 --> 00:54:39,909
like a crustiness or on the top of the

1231
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:42,120
soil you'll see that white cresting it's

1232
00:54:39,909 --> 00:54:45,309
not just the precipitate of these

1233
00:54:42,119 --> 00:54:46,809
some of these things probably a calcium

1234
00:54:45,309 --> 00:54:48,849
carbonate you know that's probably

1235
00:54:46,809 --> 00:54:51,159
what's precipitating out there it's a

1236
00:54:48,849 --> 00:54:54,849
salt that's precipitating out and I

1237
00:54:51,159 --> 00:54:56,619
would I would tend to think because we

1238
00:54:54,849 --> 00:55:01,199
tend to have a lot more calcium out

1239
00:54:56,619 --> 00:55:03,539
there and calcium will precipitate out

1240
00:55:01,199 --> 00:55:08,379
relatively easy

1241
00:55:03,539 --> 00:55:11,789
as opposed to say potassium so you know

1242
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:14,829
see their calcium magnesium precipitate

1243
00:55:11,789 --> 00:55:17,529
okay so let's we talked a little bit

1244
00:55:14,829 --> 00:55:20,049
about these numbers you know moving down

1245
00:55:17,530 --> 00:55:22,570
this saturated paste report can you just

1246
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:25,150
touch briefly on you know each of these

1247
00:55:22,570 --> 00:55:26,730
major anions and cations and and one

1248
00:55:25,150 --> 00:55:29,980
thing I want to you know for listeners

1249
00:55:26,730 --> 00:55:31,449
anions are gonna lower your ph cations

1250
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:32,800
are gonna raise your pH that's just

1251
00:55:31,449 --> 00:55:34,059
something's I just wanted to throw out

1252
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:36,870
there since we're talking about these

1253
00:55:34,059 --> 00:55:41,139
things kind of as a general rule

1254
00:55:36,869 --> 00:55:43,329
yeah and and so you know where would I

1255
00:55:41,139 --> 00:55:45,069
like to see these you mean is that what

1256
00:55:43,329 --> 00:55:46,960
you want what about the calcium and

1257
00:55:45,070 --> 00:55:49,600
calcium is going to affect route

1258
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:51,610
development so it's it's it's got to be

1259
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:53,079
there and it's got to be at the root

1260
00:55:51,610 --> 00:55:55,329
tips if you're going to get root

1261
00:55:53,079 --> 00:55:57,250
development you can't you can't take

1262
00:55:55,329 --> 00:55:58,869
calcium out of the top of the pot and

1263
00:55:57,250 --> 00:56:01,929
move it down to the roots at the bottom

1264
00:55:58,869 --> 00:56:04,139
of the pot if it's not there so calcium

1265
00:56:01,929 --> 00:56:06,730
is a huge

1266
00:56:04,139 --> 00:56:08,199
factor in there so what's the number

1267
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:11,590
exactly should be I don't think it

1268
00:56:08,199 --> 00:56:13,329
should be less than a hundred but how

1269
00:56:11,590 --> 00:56:15,539
high it should be yeah that's a good

1270
00:56:13,329 --> 00:56:19,900
question especially if you're

1271
00:56:15,539 --> 00:56:22,329
if you're trying to do this with just a

1272
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:24,880
watering regime you know it's gonna have

1273
00:56:22,329 --> 00:56:26,469
to be higher than 100 yeah I think a

1274
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:28,240
range is fine because one of the things

1275
00:56:26,469 --> 00:56:31,809
I'd like to highlight is we don't really

1276
00:56:28,239 --> 00:56:33,069
know what all of you know what's optimal

1277
00:56:31,809 --> 00:56:34,480
for this cropped adjust the researched

1278
00:56:33,070 --> 00:56:35,800
isn't out there yeah that's something

1279
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:38,159
you and I have talked about like there's

1280
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:41,410
still a lot we're learning about

1281
00:56:38,159 --> 00:56:43,299
you know what's best practice for

1282
00:56:41,409 --> 00:56:47,589
cannabis because it's just it isn't as

1283
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:51,760
well studied of a crop right and and you

1284
00:56:47,590 --> 00:56:53,608
know if you look at at a hundred and you

1285
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:57,820
can one of the things we don't know

1286
00:56:53,608 --> 00:57:00,519
between the standard test and a paste is

1287
00:56:57,820 --> 00:57:02,260
we don't know what the flow rate yes we

1288
00:57:00,519 --> 00:57:06,039
don't know what what the flow rate of

1289
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:07,840
calcium is in the solution so once we if

1290
00:57:06,039 --> 00:57:11,099
we if we could maintain a hundred I

1291
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:14,470
think one hundred reply but

1292
00:57:11,099 --> 00:57:15,719
if the flow isn't there if we don't have

1293
00:57:14,469 --> 00:57:18,509
calcium and

1294
00:57:15,719 --> 00:57:21,429
right find this or

1295
00:57:18,510 --> 00:57:24,220
the right type of calcium that will

1296
00:57:21,429 --> 00:57:26,108
continually flow and feed the plant then

1297
00:57:24,219 --> 00:57:27,839
we're gonna have to have a higher number

1298
00:57:26,108 --> 00:57:31,210
so

1299
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:33,850
that's why you know it's really hard to

1300
00:57:31,210 --> 00:57:36,670
determine exactly where you know I can I

1301
00:57:33,849 --> 00:57:40,449
can I have a better feeling saying that

1302
00:57:36,670 --> 00:57:42,519
that you'll have problems in general

1303
00:57:40,449 --> 00:57:43,649
crops if you get down to ten parts per

1304
00:57:42,519 --> 00:57:48,039
million

1305
00:57:43,650 --> 00:57:50,800
in least in cannabis probably you start

1306
00:57:48,039 --> 00:57:52,358
getting down to 40 30 40 parts per

1307
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,910
million you're going to get into trouble

1308
00:57:52,358 --> 00:57:58,269
so

1309
00:57:53,909 --> 00:58:01,569
but 30 40 parts per man is great on a on

1310
00:57:58,269 --> 00:58:04,420
a soil in the field if you're if you're

1311
00:58:01,570 --> 00:58:07,109
a growing hemp in the field that you can

1312
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:09,690
get 30 40 that'd probably be fine

1313
00:58:07,108 --> 00:58:13,119
but it

1314
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:16,740
it's just really hard to nail down a

1315
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:18,369
number but I think you know 100 150

1316
00:58:16,739 --> 00:58:20,798
providing that you're going to have a

1317
00:58:18,369 --> 00:58:22,930
flow rate and in generally speaking for

1318
00:58:20,798 --> 00:58:26,009
watering with well water we're going to

1319
00:58:22,929 --> 00:58:28,480
ice have some calcium there

1320
00:58:26,010 --> 00:58:31,329
so it depends on what what the water

1321
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:33,880
quality is to but the other thing is

1322
00:58:31,329 --> 00:58:35,500
having enough calcium is not only

1323
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:38,200
important for root development but it's

1324
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:40,889
important for cell wall integrity if

1325
00:58:38,199 --> 00:58:44,230
you're in these and these enclosures

1326
00:58:40,889 --> 00:58:48,068
where you got you can tend to get high

1327
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:50,619
humidity if you if you don't get calcium

1328
00:58:48,068 --> 00:58:52,679
in that cell wall you're you're opening

1329
00:58:50,619 --> 00:58:54,750
yourself up for powdery mildews and

1330
00:58:52,679 --> 00:58:57,368
disease problems

1331
00:58:54,750 --> 00:59:01,298
yeah well the traditional response to

1332
00:58:57,369 --> 00:59:03,490
like any plant or leaf deficiency is

1333
00:59:01,298 --> 00:59:04,798
just it was was always like add some

1334
00:59:03,489 --> 00:59:08,500
more cal-mag

1335
00:59:04,798 --> 00:59:10,509
which is higher and magnesium relative

1336
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:12,039
to the two it's calcium levels but I

1337
00:59:10,510 --> 00:59:15,010
think that's what people were trying to

1338
00:59:12,039 --> 00:59:17,700
address with these you know liquid

1339
00:59:15,010 --> 00:59:19,720
bottled nutrients but

1340
00:59:17,699 --> 00:59:22,298
essentially what I'm hearing you say

1341
00:59:19,719 --> 00:59:23,858
regarding these these things is really

1342
00:59:22,298 --> 00:59:25,568
yours you're kind of starting with

1343
00:59:23,858 --> 00:59:27,429
calcium and then you're looking to make

1344
00:59:25,568 --> 00:59:32,099
sure that you know it doesn't matter if

1345
00:59:27,429 --> 00:59:36,489
there's 2,000 you know almost 2200

1346
00:59:32,099 --> 00:59:40,028
ppm of calcium on are found in our soil

1347
00:59:36,489 --> 00:59:43,179
if that is not becoming available when

1348
00:59:40,028 --> 00:59:49,088
we do this saturate pace test right

1349
00:59:43,179 --> 00:59:50,858
right and and so I do start with calcium

1350
00:59:49,088 --> 00:59:54,788
and then what I like to do is run

1351
00:59:50,858 --> 00:59:57,328
magnesium about 5 to 1 or are the

1352
00:59:54,789 --> 01:00:00,819
calcium 5 to 1 magnesium

1353
00:59:57,329 --> 01:00:03,760
so like in this case here if I really

1354
01:00:00,818 --> 01:00:07,028
wanted a balance in the solution where

1355
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:11,010
you have 61 magnesium I'm going to need

1356
01:00:07,028 --> 01:00:15,480
it I would need about 300 of

1357
01:00:11,010 --> 01:00:18,430
the calcium to stay at that 5 to 1 ratio

1358
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:20,710
now I tell people that's what you want

1359
01:00:18,429 --> 01:00:23,108
to do but you then you've got to watch

1360
01:00:20,710 --> 01:00:24,690
how high you push the soluble salts when

1361
01:00:23,108 --> 01:00:28,150
you do that

1362
01:00:24,690 --> 01:00:30,608
so if I can get so if I can get the

1363
01:00:28,150 --> 01:00:31,829
potassium twice the magnesium and the

1364
01:00:30,608 --> 01:00:34,539
magnesium

1365
01:00:31,829 --> 01:00:36,670
one fifth of the calcium

1366
01:00:34,539 --> 01:00:40,539
then I feel like I've got a pretty good

1367
01:00:36,670 --> 01:00:43,570
ratio or balance in the solution and but

1368
01:00:40,539 --> 01:00:44,309
but you can't there's a limitation of

1369
01:00:43,570 --> 01:00:47,620
how

1370
01:00:44,309 --> 01:00:50,440
you just can't keep adding one to

1371
01:00:47,619 --> 01:00:52,569
balance out the other because of the

1372
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:56,679
salt problem well and it's gonna raise

1373
01:00:52,570 --> 01:00:58,600
your pH as well yeah yeah and magnesium

1374
01:00:56,679 --> 01:01:00,309
as I understand raises your pH one and a

1375
01:00:58,599 --> 01:01:01,480
half times of what calcium does so you

1376
01:01:00,309 --> 01:01:04,329
have to be really careful when you start

1377
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:06,130
adding may knees and it in traditional

1378
01:01:04,329 --> 01:01:08,230
soils it tightens the soil I don't know

1379
01:01:06,130 --> 01:01:11,619
if we're seeing that so much with

1380
01:01:08,230 --> 01:01:13,659
potting soils to be an issue but that in

1381
01:01:11,619 --> 01:01:15,549
theory is is what people say is you know

1382
01:01:13,659 --> 01:01:18,670
magnesium tightens your soil and calcium

1383
01:01:15,550 --> 01:01:21,370
flock aids or loosens your soils in

1384
01:01:18,670 --> 01:01:23,530
terms of the till and these in this

1385
01:01:21,369 --> 01:01:26,650
situation I don't think that applies and

1386
01:01:23,530 --> 01:01:29,500
this real it really doesn't apply very I

1387
01:01:26,650 --> 01:01:32,769
mean the reason why Albrecht looked at

1388
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:35,730
the calcium magnesium ratios was -

1389
01:01:32,769 --> 01:01:39,400
because it has an impact on soil physics

1390
01:01:35,730 --> 01:01:43,090
well you don't really have a slow fit in

1391
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:45,519
in modified mixes or in sands for that

1392
01:01:43,090 --> 01:01:49,019
and one that matter you know you get

1393
01:01:45,519 --> 01:01:51,940
into sands you don't have the compaction

1394
01:01:49,019 --> 01:01:54,159
because of a clay I mean you can have

1395
01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:58,269
compassion because of the fineness of

1396
01:01:54,159 --> 01:02:01,829
the sand but the magnesium in a lot of

1397
01:01:58,269 --> 01:02:04,690
sands I will I will push up to 20%

1398
01:02:01,829 --> 01:02:09,449
we're in a heavy clay that might be way

1399
01:02:04,690 --> 01:02:12,159
too high but so yeah it's uh

1400
01:02:09,449 --> 01:02:14,559
you know the magnesium course if you add

1401
01:02:12,159 --> 01:02:17,289
magnesium as magnesium sulfate or epsom

1402
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:20,250
salts that is a strong acid strong base

1403
01:02:17,289 --> 01:02:24,239
and that's not going to change your pH

1404
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:26,860
except when you if you get to salts - I

1405
01:02:24,239 --> 01:02:29,619
yeah another thing I just want to

1406
01:02:26,860 --> 01:02:32,170
highlight is it's much easier to add

1407
01:02:29,619 --> 01:02:33,969
than it is to remove and I think that's

1408
01:02:32,170 --> 01:02:36,599
important for people to keep in mind

1409
01:02:33,969 --> 01:02:39,129
that less is more in a lot of cases

1410
01:02:36,599 --> 01:02:41,469
that's true it's really hard to take

1411
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:44,440
that put that out of there once in the

1412
01:02:41,469 --> 01:02:47,679
pot yeah and to me that applies almost

1413
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:51,400
more to phosphorus because we I've seen

1414
01:02:47,679 --> 01:02:53,588
pm's over over 6-thousand when we're

1415
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:54,599
talking about phosphorus on the Mallik

1416
01:02:53,588 --> 01:02:57,909
test

1417
01:02:54,599 --> 01:03:00,130
how does that first of all what issues

1418
01:02:57,909 --> 01:03:02,289
do we have besides a waste of money and

1419
01:03:00,130 --> 01:03:04,510
potentially leeching phosphates into our

1420
01:03:02,289 --> 01:03:07,088
water supply from a plant health

1421
01:03:04,510 --> 01:03:08,790
perspective what issues does that create

1422
01:03:07,088 --> 01:03:12,880
you mentioned zinc

1423
01:03:08,789 --> 01:03:14,710
but how much available phosphorus do we

1424
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:15,818
want to see and how do you correlate

1425
01:03:14,710 --> 01:03:18,329
those numbers when we're talking

1426
01:03:15,818 --> 01:03:21,550
phosphorus

1427
01:03:18,329 --> 01:03:25,180
if you're if you're looking at the the

1428
01:03:21,550 --> 01:03:27,849
phosphorus on the pace test you know I

1429
01:03:25,179 --> 01:03:30,989
think two two and a half parts per

1430
01:03:27,849 --> 01:03:33,430
million should be enough but

1431
01:03:30,989 --> 01:03:35,649
you know as you as you push them up

1432
01:03:33,429 --> 01:03:38,549
higher you're right in this I don't

1433
01:03:35,650 --> 01:03:41,800
really see so much problem with

1434
01:03:38,550 --> 01:03:44,950
phosphorus other than the fact that then

1435
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:47,680
zinc just drops out of the picture and

1436
01:03:44,949 --> 01:03:50,669
the tissue analysis in the leaf tissue

1437
01:03:47,679 --> 01:03:52,659
analysis yes yes

1438
01:03:50,670 --> 01:03:54,309
because this is one of the challenges of

1439
01:03:52,659 --> 01:03:57,219
cannabis is it's really hard to get leaf

1440
01:03:54,309 --> 01:03:59,980
tissue analysis done and then if you do

1441
01:03:57,219 --> 01:04:01,719
get leaf tissue analysis done most

1442
01:03:59,980 --> 01:04:04,510
people aren't sharing that data so it's

1443
01:04:01,719 --> 01:04:06,338
it's really hard to find accurate

1444
01:04:04,510 --> 01:04:07,630
information but I have heard of you

1445
01:04:06,338 --> 01:04:10,539
heard a lot about the you know

1446
01:04:07,630 --> 01:04:11,710
phosphorus zinc relationship so if you

1447
01:04:10,539 --> 01:04:14,829
were looking at these numbers you just

1448
01:04:11,710 --> 01:04:17,318
said we have sufficient phosphorus but

1449
01:04:14,829 --> 01:04:19,119
possibly excessive in terms of in

1450
01:04:17,318 --> 01:04:21,130
relation to our zinc numbers down below

1451
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:23,858
there that are at point zero three ppm

1452
01:04:21,130 --> 01:04:27,150
is that number yet low because the

1453
01:04:23,858 --> 01:04:28,679
phosphorus is so high that's possible

1454
01:04:27,150 --> 01:04:32,200
yes

1455
01:04:28,679 --> 01:04:34,000
so could you relate back to the standard

1456
01:04:32,199 --> 01:04:37,000
soil test where it shows six point eight

1457
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:39,449
nine ppm with of zinc and how do you

1458
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:41,730
kind of like correlate that

1459
01:04:39,449 --> 01:04:43,989
well you can't

1460
01:04:41,730 --> 01:04:46,599
you know you look at six point nine and

1461
01:04:43,989 --> 01:04:49,149
and some of the some of the data you'll

1462
01:04:46,599 --> 01:04:51,460
see out here from tri-state data and

1463
01:04:49,150 --> 01:04:53,858
stuff which is mainly set up for soils

1464
01:04:51,460 --> 01:04:59,309
they'll say all six point nine is hot is

1465
01:04:53,858 --> 01:05:02,650
is high but yet at 132 parts per million

1466
01:04:59,309 --> 01:05:04,870
phosphorus out there all right I say

1467
01:05:02,650 --> 01:05:07,389
you've got to run your zinc in a

1468
01:05:04,869 --> 01:05:09,549
relationship to your phosphorus in other

1469
01:05:07,389 --> 01:05:11,949
words if your Klosters is high you can't

1470
01:05:09,550 --> 01:05:13,720
have to have your zinc high and where

1471
01:05:11,949 --> 01:05:14,849
that where that number should be I can't

1472
01:05:13,719 --> 01:05:18,339
tell you

1473
01:05:14,849 --> 01:05:21,789
except that that I really don't believe

1474
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:23,579
that 6.9 is high enough I think at 132

1475
01:05:21,789 --> 01:05:26,170
parts per million

1476
01:05:23,579 --> 01:05:29,170
you know that zinc could could very

1477
01:05:26,170 --> 01:05:30,450
easily have to be up there 20 30 parts

1478
01:05:29,170 --> 01:05:32,740
per million you

1479
01:05:30,449 --> 01:05:34,779
know this is all stuff that I want to

1480
01:05:32,739 --> 01:05:36,669
start playing around with as we learn

1481
01:05:34,780 --> 01:05:39,430
more and doing some more controlled

1482
01:05:36,670 --> 01:05:40,869
research but it's really hard to find

1483
01:05:39,429 --> 01:05:43,000
this information and then the other

1484
01:05:40,869 --> 01:05:46,299
challenge is like we're not seeing any

1485
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:48,699
sort of zinc deficiencies in the

1486
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:51,880
facilities that we work with you know in

1487
01:05:48,699 --> 01:05:53,859
terms of leaf expression yet I do wonder

1488
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:56,170
if we play around with these numbers if

1489
01:05:53,860 --> 01:05:59,620
we would see some sort of improvement in

1490
01:05:56,170 --> 01:06:01,920
in overall growth due to the you know

1491
01:05:59,619 --> 01:06:04,029
increased zinc uptake but

1492
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:06,159
unless you're seeing it you know and not

1493
01:06:04,030 --> 01:06:08,680
all not all of these will display

1494
01:06:06,159 --> 01:06:10,329
necessarily as a leaf deficiency you can

1495
01:06:08,679 --> 01:06:12,099
still stress a plant without actually

1496
01:06:10,329 --> 01:06:13,929
seeing it appear in the leaf tissue

1497
01:06:12,099 --> 01:06:16,500
which I think people is important to

1498
01:06:13,929 --> 01:06:19,809
emphasize too so

1499
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:24,280
thing they call hidden hunger and and I

1500
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:29,610
think you know zinc a big player in new

1501
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:32,560
growth we tend to we tend to sample

1502
01:06:29,610 --> 01:06:34,630
maybe older growth so you know bud

1503
01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:37,980
growth I think it will have would be it

1504
01:06:34,630 --> 01:06:40,740
more impacted by I think than

1505
01:06:37,980 --> 01:06:43,449
maybe maybe the lead

1506
01:06:40,739 --> 01:06:45,339
so what do you think regarding foliar

1507
01:06:43,449 --> 01:06:48,699
applications is some of these different

1508
01:06:45,340 --> 01:06:50,559
you know sulfates or even chelated

1509
01:06:48,699 --> 01:06:52,239
versions like that are organic like we

1510
01:06:50,559 --> 01:06:54,420
use the biomen products I know you're

1511
01:06:52,239 --> 01:06:57,519
familiar with those

1512
01:06:54,420 --> 01:06:59,409
what do you think of that because in my

1513
01:06:57,519 --> 01:07:00,909
experience when I have worked with

1514
01:06:59,409 --> 01:07:02,289
growers that have gone really far down

1515
01:07:00,909 --> 01:07:03,399
the rabbit hole with these trace

1516
01:07:02,289 --> 01:07:05,699
elements and trying to balance

1517
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:08,880
everything out using these soil tests

1518
01:07:05,699 --> 01:07:12,639
typically their crop goes downhill

1519
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:13,930
unfortunately and I don't know and so so

1520
01:07:12,639 --> 01:07:15,940
I haven't really messed with these

1521
01:07:13,929 --> 01:07:17,980
numbers and frankly I don't want to add

1522
01:07:15,940 --> 01:07:19,659
some of these sulfates to because we

1523
01:07:17,980 --> 01:07:21,338
want to keep our soil organic and allow

1524
01:07:19,659 --> 01:07:23,319
growers you know you could say there's

1525
01:07:21,338 --> 01:07:25,420
purported deficiency now on this soil

1526
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:27,400
test if they want to add zinc sulfate at

1527
01:07:25,420 --> 01:07:30,220
a certain rate and experiment with it by

1528
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:33,250
all means but I wonder I guess I'm

1529
01:07:30,219 --> 01:07:34,539
asking two questions one how how much

1530
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:37,599
trouble can you get in playing around

1531
01:07:34,539 --> 01:07:39,608
with these trace elements and then two

1532
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:43,240
what do you think about foliar

1533
01:07:39,608 --> 01:07:44,949
applications either of sulfates or you

1534
01:07:43,239 --> 01:07:46,289
know chelated versions of these using

1535
01:07:44,949 --> 01:07:49,329
humic acids or

1536
01:07:46,289 --> 01:07:53,670
you know by almond sort of products well

1537
01:07:49,329 --> 01:07:56,579
I I would I much prefer the the AEDPA

1538
01:07:53,670 --> 01:07:59,550
chelated traces

1539
01:07:56,579 --> 01:08:02,769
there is some

1540
01:07:59,550 --> 01:08:04,539
if you do sulfates you got to be really

1541
01:08:02,769 --> 01:08:06,940
careful you probably have less of a

1542
01:08:04,539 --> 01:08:08,769
chance of burn on metals as much as but

1543
01:08:06,940 --> 01:08:12,220
you will have more of a chance of a burn

1544
01:08:08,769 --> 01:08:14,769
for a sulfate burn so you know that that

1545
01:08:12,219 --> 01:08:17,429
becomes a the issue and when you get

1546
01:08:14,769 --> 01:08:22,270
these soils and and they're so rich in

1547
01:08:17,430 --> 01:08:23,920
in phosphates and the cations I don't

1548
01:08:22,270 --> 01:08:27,779
really worry too much about boron

1549
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:30,850
because being an anion that it's not

1550
01:08:27,779 --> 01:08:33,120
impacted by the cations so much I mean

1551
01:08:30,850 --> 01:08:36,219
calcium chloride is very insoluble but

1552
01:08:33,119 --> 01:08:39,250
boron just seems to be pretty much okay

1553
01:08:36,219 --> 01:08:43,409
in a lot of cases but but copper and

1554
01:08:39,250 --> 01:08:46,390
zinc I mean I run probably

1555
01:08:43,409 --> 01:08:50,710
almost a hundred percent deficient in

1556
01:08:46,390 --> 01:08:52,350
copper and I certainly you know I would

1557
01:08:50,710 --> 01:08:55,810
not like to

1558
01:08:52,350 --> 01:08:58,420
just build these soils up with too much

1559
01:08:55,810 --> 01:09:01,509
copper and we used to think that 20

1560
01:08:58,420 --> 01:09:04,539
parts per million copper was toxic until

1561
01:09:01,509 --> 01:09:06,609
I went and looked at some grapes and

1562
01:09:04,539 --> 01:09:10,238
Portugal and they had 300 parts per

1563
01:09:06,609 --> 01:09:12,670
million so you know coppers is really

1564
01:09:10,238 --> 01:09:14,199
bound up by organic fractions and I

1565
01:09:12,670 --> 01:09:15,869
think that's one of the reasons why we

1566
01:09:14,199 --> 01:09:19,568
don't see much

1567
01:09:15,869 --> 01:09:22,059
copper in these pace tests and why we

1568
01:09:19,569 --> 01:09:24,400
probably should be looking at at doing

1569
01:09:22,060 --> 01:09:27,489
more more in the in a foliar feeding

1570
01:09:24,399 --> 01:09:31,259
with chelate now one thing I do know

1571
01:09:27,488 --> 01:09:32,209
that Zink there there is a there's kind

1572
01:09:31,260 --> 01:09:35,420
of a

1573
01:09:32,210 --> 01:09:39,239
response time here

1574
01:09:35,420 --> 01:09:41,489
like zinc is more recent think like the

1575
01:09:39,239 --> 01:09:43,340
plants like zinc much earlier than say

1576
01:09:41,489 --> 01:09:47,519
manganese

1577
01:09:43,340 --> 01:09:50,449
so when I get some work on some of the

1578
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:53,670
agricultural crops

1579
01:09:50,449 --> 01:09:56,279
spraying was thanking me early on very

1580
01:09:53,670 --> 01:09:59,039
early gave me a better results than uh I

1581
01:09:56,279 --> 01:10:01,139
waited but I could wait with manganese

1582
01:09:59,039 --> 01:10:04,319
so you know coming in with a spray

1583
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:06,300
program with a chelate I think you can

1584
01:10:04,319 --> 01:10:08,389
put together a program spray them every

1585
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:12,230
10 to 14 days and

1586
01:10:08,390 --> 01:10:15,450
and just cover a lot of your bases

1587
01:10:12,229 --> 01:10:16,699
now you said you prefer key lights with

1588
01:10:15,449 --> 01:10:18,769
EDTA

1589
01:10:16,699 --> 01:10:21,929
dddd ta

1590
01:10:18,770 --> 01:10:24,780
if we want to use products that are

1591
01:10:21,930 --> 01:10:26,810
either organic or allowed in organic

1592
01:10:24,779 --> 01:10:29,609
production and I know that's a sort of a

1593
01:10:26,810 --> 01:10:31,970
tricky minefield when it comes to that

1594
01:10:29,609 --> 01:10:34,759
subject but

1595
01:10:31,970 --> 01:10:37,920
what are your recommendations there

1596
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:40,199
well when you start going organic you

1597
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:42,930
know there's certainly EDTA sir thrown

1598
01:10:40,199 --> 01:10:46,019
out exact there you're there you're

1599
01:10:42,930 --> 01:10:48,710
looking at you know I think sulfates

1600
01:10:46,020 --> 01:10:52,410
about ends up being about the

1601
01:10:48,710 --> 01:10:54,319
only thing you have I don't know of

1602
01:10:52,409 --> 01:10:57,689
anything else do you

1603
01:10:54,319 --> 01:10:59,359
well the bio main products are approved

1604
01:10:57,689 --> 01:11:02,250
for use in organic production

1605
01:10:59,359 --> 01:11:04,789
I can't remember exactly what the key

1606
01:11:02,250 --> 01:11:06,689
later is it's all it's all a little bit

1607
01:11:04,789 --> 01:11:08,850
bureaucratic in terms of what's allowed

1608
01:11:06,689 --> 01:11:09,949
and what's not allowed in terms it's not

1609
01:11:08,850 --> 01:11:12,180
as

1610
01:11:09,949 --> 01:11:13,859
it's not as clear as it should be I

1611
01:11:12,180 --> 01:11:16,890
can't remember exactly what they're

1612
01:11:13,859 --> 01:11:18,569
using but it essentially they just they

1613
01:11:16,890 --> 01:11:19,890
found a workaround in terms of organic

1614
01:11:18,569 --> 01:11:23,429
production but I didn't feel like it was

1615
01:11:19,890 --> 01:11:24,660
necessarily a hundred percent or you

1616
01:11:23,430 --> 01:11:26,310
know anymore yeah but when we're talking

1617
01:11:24,659 --> 01:11:27,930
about these sulfates to like you look at

1618
01:11:26,310 --> 01:11:30,680
manganese sulfate it's this little pink

1619
01:11:27,930 --> 01:11:34,920
ball it's obviously been

1620
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:37,460
you know fairly highly processed by

1621
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:39,989
humans I

1622
01:11:37,460 --> 01:11:41,130
just don't know I wonder too about if we

1623
01:11:39,989 --> 01:11:44,519
you know if we took some of these

1624
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:47,279
sulfates use a key later like humic acid

1625
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:49,320
would that allow us and I'm not a

1626
01:11:47,279 --> 01:11:51,509
chemistry person is that something we

1627
01:11:49,319 --> 01:11:54,210
could apply as a foliar application as a

1628
01:11:51,510 --> 01:11:56,909
way of getting these nutrients on there

1629
01:11:54,210 --> 01:11:59,189
and a semi or you know or a quasi

1630
01:11:56,909 --> 01:12:01,079
organic fashion because you know humic

1631
01:11:59,189 --> 01:12:03,750
acid has been you know they probably use

1632
01:12:01,079 --> 01:12:05,550
potassium hydroxide to extract it it's

1633
01:12:03,750 --> 01:12:06,779
not a hundred percent organic either but

1634
01:12:05,550 --> 01:12:09,960
it's the same as using like fish

1635
01:12:06,779 --> 01:12:11,579
hydrolysate or you know seaweed extract

1636
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:12,920
powder these other these other things

1637
01:12:11,579 --> 01:12:17,010
that have some

1638
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:19,500
allowance for chemical inputs yeah I

1639
01:12:17,010 --> 01:12:23,010
think anytime you're using the sulfates

1640
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:25,130
using real high-quality fulvic acid is

1641
01:12:23,010 --> 01:12:28,940
is to your advantage

1642
01:12:25,130 --> 01:12:31,500
now I've seen data that says

1643
01:12:28,939 --> 01:12:34,829
we really don't want more than five

1644
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:37,829
pounds of sulfate a combination of

1645
01:12:34,829 --> 01:12:39,949
sulfated traces more than five pounds

1646
01:12:37,829 --> 01:12:43,699
per hundred gallons

1647
01:12:39,949 --> 01:12:47,010
of media

1648
01:12:43,699 --> 01:12:50,250
sulfated minerals so if you had this

1649
01:12:47,010 --> 01:12:53,730
thing you put a 3 pounds of zinc sulfate

1650
01:12:50,250 --> 01:12:56,069
a pound of manganese sulfate a pound of

1651
01:12:53,729 --> 01:12:59,250
copper sulfate you're at the limit right

1652
01:12:56,069 --> 01:13:02,899
there Oh in a water solution okay yeah

1653
01:12:59,250 --> 01:13:06,510
yeah in a foliar spray god oh

1654
01:13:02,899 --> 01:13:09,269
you know I'm not sure that that under

1655
01:13:06,510 --> 01:13:12,210
those growing conditions I mean pity

1656
01:13:09,270 --> 01:13:14,220
sakes or you spray one or two plants but

1657
01:13:12,210 --> 01:13:16,880
you know beforehand so you don't get

1658
01:13:14,220 --> 01:13:18,650
into trouble but I

1659
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:21,890
think

1660
01:13:18,649 --> 01:13:25,920
putting it putting the fulvic acid in is

1661
01:13:21,890 --> 01:13:27,539
is a real beneficial thing to get get

1662
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:28,940
those nutrients in and move it in the

1663
01:13:27,539 --> 01:13:30,810
plant

1664
01:13:28,939 --> 01:13:32,519
yeah that brings up a whole nother

1665
01:13:30,810 --> 01:13:34,410
challenge though with labeling issues

1666
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:37,010
around fulvic acid you know there's

1667
01:13:34,409 --> 01:13:39,269
there's only one commercially available

1668
01:13:37,010 --> 01:13:41,690
purely fulvic acid product that I'm

1669
01:13:39,270 --> 01:13:44,700
aware of that's marketed as such

1670
01:13:41,689 --> 01:13:47,729
from bio egg but I know we work with

1671
01:13:44,699 --> 01:13:49,679
other human asset producers that claim

1672
01:13:47,729 --> 01:13:51,459
to have fairly high levels of fulvic

1673
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:53,200
acid in their products but they're not

1674
01:13:51,460 --> 01:13:54,159
able to put them on the label based on

1675
01:13:53,199 --> 01:13:56,139
the way that they register their

1676
01:13:54,159 --> 01:13:57,219
products so it's all a little bit

1677
01:13:56,140 --> 01:14:00,090
confusing in terms of what you're

1678
01:13:57,219 --> 01:14:03,630
actually getting anyway I

1679
01:14:00,090 --> 01:14:06,989
know that New Tech has

1680
01:14:03,630 --> 01:14:10,989
an Omri approved

1681
01:14:06,988 --> 01:14:15,479
what they call connector oh and that is

1682
01:14:10,988 --> 01:14:18,039
a real high great fulvic acid

1683
01:14:15,479 --> 01:14:19,738
okay cool off to look into that product

1684
01:14:18,039 --> 01:14:23,380
so

1685
01:14:19,738 --> 01:14:25,869
just basically you know I I appreciate

1686
01:14:23,380 --> 01:14:27,880
you covering a lot of a lot of this in

1687
01:14:25,869 --> 01:14:29,949
terms of the testing I kind of want to

1688
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:32,739
go over way some of the major takeaways

1689
01:14:29,949 --> 01:14:35,619
from today and from our conversation in

1690
01:14:32,738 --> 01:14:36,759
terms of these soil tests so it sounds

1691
01:14:35,619 --> 01:14:39,460
like we need to be careful when we're

1692
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:42,539
looking at or evaluating these tests

1693
01:14:39,460 --> 01:14:45,039
based on the way the tests are taken

1694
01:14:42,539 --> 01:14:48,250
what would be your major takeaways for

1695
01:14:45,039 --> 01:14:50,469
people in terms of the the Mallik test

1696
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:53,260
the saturated paste report I want to

1697
01:14:50,469 --> 01:14:55,469
encourage users to still get soil tests

1698
01:14:53,260 --> 01:14:58,150
I think that's really important

1699
01:14:55,469 --> 01:15:00,730
but there's certainly an air of caution

1700
01:14:58,149 --> 01:15:03,000
in terms of how we're consulting and

1701
01:15:00,729 --> 01:15:06,309
recommending off of them

1702
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:08,800
well that's true and we can make all

1703
01:15:06,310 --> 01:15:12,250
kinds of criticisms about you know

1704
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:14,469
whether we're using five five mil scoops

1705
01:15:12,250 --> 01:15:16,659
or whatever but the other the other

1706
01:15:14,469 --> 01:15:18,539
thing it comes down to is how well are

1707
01:15:16,659 --> 01:15:21,729
the growers

1708
01:15:18,539 --> 01:15:24,250
mixing the product mixing that sample

1709
01:15:21,729 --> 01:15:26,379
and how well are they sampling it if

1710
01:15:24,250 --> 01:15:28,899
they're sampling it during the grow

1711
01:15:26,380 --> 01:15:30,489
cycle you know are you taking a probe

1712
01:15:28,899 --> 01:15:32,799
and probing down through there you just

1713
01:15:30,488 --> 01:15:35,379
taking some off the sides off the top

1714
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:37,529
you know you really need to get a good

1715
01:15:35,380 --> 01:15:39,579
thorough

1716
01:15:37,529 --> 01:15:41,439
representative sample and that's

1717
01:15:39,579 --> 01:15:42,719
something I think you know needs to be

1718
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:44,949
addressed -

1719
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:46,779
that's a really good point there's a lot

1720
01:15:44,949 --> 01:15:50,199
of room for error in this whole process

1721
01:15:46,779 --> 01:15:51,130
either on the you know then we got to

1722
01:15:50,199 --> 01:15:53,019
take that into account when we're

1723
01:15:51,130 --> 01:15:56,409
looking at these tests

1724
01:15:53,020 --> 01:15:58,450
right right so I don't necessarily freak

1725
01:15:56,409 --> 01:16:00,099
out when I see a test that looks less

1726
01:15:58,449 --> 01:16:01,599
than what people would consider to be

1727
01:16:00,100 --> 01:16:03,070
optimal or doesn't look perfectly

1728
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:04,960
balanced I always want to start with how

1729
01:16:03,069 --> 01:16:07,409
does your plant look what's going on

1730
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:10,149
there how does your crop finish you know

1731
01:16:07,409 --> 01:16:12,699
can't argue with success and that that

1732
01:16:10,149 --> 01:16:14,789
plant is successful then you're not

1733
01:16:12,699 --> 01:16:17,529
doing all that bad

1734
01:16:14,789 --> 01:16:21,279
so one last question I have you know

1735
01:16:17,529 --> 01:16:23,590
this is really confusing stuff for most

1736
01:16:21,279 --> 01:16:26,109
people myself included you know I'm

1737
01:16:23,590 --> 01:16:27,970
trying to look at a standard test the

1738
01:16:26,109 --> 01:16:30,039
saturated pace test there's you know

1739
01:16:27,970 --> 01:16:32,829
obviously other tests like in methods

1740
01:16:30,039 --> 01:16:35,529
you know like like Bray and some of

1741
01:16:32,829 --> 01:16:38,529
those others how do we take these

1742
01:16:35,529 --> 01:16:39,239
numbers and come up with any sort of

1743
01:16:38,529 --> 01:16:41,800
like

1744
01:16:39,239 --> 01:16:43,329
quantifiable understanding or

1745
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:45,610
recommendation assuming that these

1746
01:16:43,329 --> 01:16:47,769
numbers aren't necessarily the end-all

1747
01:16:45,609 --> 01:16:50,289
be-all you know I hear some consultants

1748
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:52,150
that are so confident regarding their

1749
01:16:50,289 --> 01:16:53,619
recommendations around these numbers for

1750
01:16:52,149 --> 01:16:57,129
crops without ever really seeing the

1751
01:16:53,619 --> 01:17:00,159
crop I mean how are we how can we really

1752
01:16:57,130 --> 01:17:01,529
do that or can we even do that I'm not

1753
01:17:00,159 --> 01:17:05,590
sure we can't

1754
01:17:01,529 --> 01:17:08,319
you know it again it goes back to how

1755
01:17:05,590 --> 01:17:09,190
the crop is responding and you look at

1756
01:17:08,319 --> 01:17:10,779
these numbers

1757
01:17:09,189 --> 01:17:13,979
well okay these numbers don't reflect

1758
01:17:10,779 --> 01:17:16,809
what what the water quality is and

1759
01:17:13,979 --> 01:17:19,449
it doesn't reflect what the lighting is

1760
01:17:16,810 --> 01:17:22,570
I mean you've got to you've got to look

1761
01:17:19,449 --> 01:17:24,250
at this thing in a holistic fashion you

1762
01:17:22,569 --> 01:17:26,710
know this is a part this is a part of

1763
01:17:24,250 --> 01:17:30,090
the the the tools that you have to work

1764
01:17:26,710 --> 01:17:33,550
with but if you if you

1765
01:17:30,090 --> 01:17:35,170
you've got to understand and really pay

1766
01:17:33,550 --> 01:17:36,840
attention to what your plants are saying

1767
01:17:35,170 --> 01:17:38,890
back to you

1768
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:40,930
and it doesn't take into account the

1769
01:17:38,890 --> 01:17:42,880
biological activity of the soil which is

1770
01:17:40,930 --> 01:17:44,050
cycling these nutrients and I think

1771
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:47,109
that's one of the things that's really

1772
01:17:44,050 --> 01:17:48,489
helped us with our soils is I and that's

1773
01:17:47,109 --> 01:17:50,679
something I look at under the microscope

1774
01:17:48,489 --> 01:17:52,449
and have a better grasp of is sort of

1775
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:53,890
what's going on biologically in these

1776
01:17:52,449 --> 01:17:55,389
soils because that's that's what's

1777
01:17:53,890 --> 01:17:56,760
ultimately making a lot of these

1778
01:17:55,390 --> 01:18:00,100
nutrients available

1779
01:17:56,760 --> 01:18:03,970
right right and one of the things that I

1780
01:18:00,100 --> 01:18:07,190
have seen more problems with is people

1781
01:18:03,970 --> 01:18:09,590
that's recycling the mix what to be

1782
01:18:07,189 --> 01:18:10,839
happening is more and more nutrients are

1783
01:18:09,590 --> 01:18:14,569
coming out

1784
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:16,819
during the the group first grow and then

1785
01:18:14,569 --> 01:18:19,130
buy time to get into the second grow and

1786
01:18:16,819 --> 01:18:22,880
then they want to kind of add their

1787
01:18:19,130 --> 01:18:25,960
their normal fertility to that they're

1788
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:28,429
running into a salsa problem

1789
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:32,408
that makes sense so we want we almost

1790
01:18:28,429 --> 01:18:36,289
need to look at every growing situation

1791
01:18:32,408 --> 01:18:39,170
as its own separate entity and then take

1792
01:18:36,289 --> 01:18:42,229
a look at all of these variables

1793
01:18:39,170 --> 01:18:44,179
together and then I guess for me and I

1794
01:18:42,229 --> 01:18:46,250
don't feel confident making a lot of

1795
01:18:44,179 --> 01:18:47,868
like quantifiable recommendations but I

1796
01:18:46,250 --> 01:18:49,880
can look at a trend and say hey we're

1797
01:18:47,868 --> 01:18:51,799
seeing the calcium is kind of staying

1798
01:18:49,880 --> 01:18:54,859
where it's at let's not add anymore this

1799
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:58,340
cycle or we added more potassium at this

1800
01:18:54,859 --> 01:19:00,078
rate and we got this response I think

1801
01:18:58,340 --> 01:19:02,210
it's something we could up or we could

1802
01:19:00,078 --> 01:19:05,269
lower we maintain and that's how I've

1803
01:19:02,210 --> 01:19:07,849
been sort of been doing been doing this

1804
01:19:05,270 --> 01:19:09,530
but it's it I've I've been wracking my

1805
01:19:07,849 --> 01:19:12,770
brain for years on trying to find a

1806
01:19:09,529 --> 01:19:14,859
better way of quantifying things and I

1807
01:19:12,770 --> 01:19:18,619
haven't come up with it yet honestly

1808
01:19:14,859 --> 01:19:24,319
well you know as much and I've worked in

1809
01:19:18,618 --> 01:19:25,750
a standard soil well I'm and we're still

1810
01:19:24,319 --> 01:19:27,710
not

1811
01:19:25,750 --> 01:19:29,328
somebody tells you they got all the

1812
01:19:27,710 --> 01:19:33,698
answers they just haven't asked all the

1813
01:19:29,328 --> 01:19:37,808
questions because it's certainly

1814
01:19:33,698 --> 01:19:40,848
it's not it's not easy thing I

1815
01:19:37,809 --> 01:19:42,529
think that's a great point so I'll

1816
01:19:40,849 --> 01:19:44,270
definitely keep that in mind moving for

1817
01:19:42,529 --> 01:19:47,149
and I hope growers will continue to test

1818
01:19:44,270 --> 01:19:49,699
but just test with a grain of salt and

1819
01:19:47,149 --> 01:19:52,509
realize that you need to look at this

1820
01:19:49,698 --> 01:19:55,509
test in the environments of

1821
01:19:52,510 --> 01:19:57,739
humidity temperature watering habits

1822
01:19:55,510 --> 01:19:59,599
biological activity all the things that

1823
01:19:57,738 --> 01:20:03,589
you mentioned there need to come into

1824
01:19:59,599 --> 01:20:05,090
play - yeah exactly well I really

1825
01:20:03,590 --> 01:20:07,670
appreciate your time today bill this was

1826
01:20:05,090 --> 01:20:10,069
really enlightening for me I hope that

1827
01:20:07,670 --> 01:20:12,289
growers will reach out can you talk a

1828
01:20:10,069 --> 01:20:14,389
little bit about your role in relation

1829
01:20:12,289 --> 01:20:17,529
to Logan and what sort of consulting

1830
01:20:14,389 --> 01:20:19,118
you're doing on these tests

1831
01:20:17,529 --> 01:20:22,429
well

1832
01:20:19,118 --> 01:20:25,479
I'm probably add a bigger disadvantage

1833
01:20:22,430 --> 01:20:29,900
than you are I as the consultant to

1834
01:20:25,479 --> 01:20:34,639
agronomist to Logan if they request for

1835
01:20:29,899 --> 01:20:38,420
me to evaluate the the the analysis

1836
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:41,090
it'll come to me and and I'll write

1837
01:20:38,420 --> 01:20:42,859
something up and and send it back to the

1838
01:20:41,090 --> 01:20:46,460
Logan and then they'll forward or back

1839
01:20:42,859 --> 01:20:49,460
to the client so I mean I and but again

1840
01:20:46,460 --> 01:20:51,130
I I am at a disadvantage because I don't

1841
01:20:49,460 --> 01:20:55,039
see a lot of

1842
01:20:51,130 --> 01:20:58,039
those facilities and I do have guys send

1843
01:20:55,039 --> 01:20:59,600
me pictures and look at them and and but

1844
01:20:58,039 --> 01:21:00,550
again it's not like being there either

1845
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:03,640
but

1846
01:21:00,550 --> 01:21:07,250
we've been fairly successful in helping

1847
01:21:03,640 --> 01:21:10,430
people that that's in trouble it's just

1848
01:21:07,250 --> 01:21:12,460
sooner PC people do more testing and try

1849
01:21:10,430 --> 01:21:17,650
to stay out of trouble

1850
01:21:12,460 --> 01:21:20,239
so yeah I'm independent of

1851
01:21:17,649 --> 01:21:22,279
Logan but you can either run it through

1852
01:21:20,239 --> 01:21:24,469
the Logan or they could contact me

1853
01:21:22,279 --> 01:21:26,899
directly and I'll put your information

1854
01:21:24,470 --> 01:21:28,789
on the website page but people if they

1855
01:21:26,899 --> 01:21:30,769
ask for a recommendation from Logan

1856
01:21:28,789 --> 01:21:32,449
based on their test result because what

1857
01:21:30,770 --> 01:21:34,490
they'll get back is literally just this

1858
01:21:32,449 --> 01:21:36,439
soil report that I'm gonna put on the

1859
01:21:34,489 --> 01:21:38,869
podcast page if they want a

1860
01:21:36,439 --> 01:21:40,519
recommendation off of it then you're the

1861
01:21:38,869 --> 01:21:43,539
one you're the guy that's who's making

1862
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:43,540
that recommendation correct

1863
01:21:44,050 --> 01:21:48,800
okay and you're you're being transparent

1864
01:21:47,750 --> 01:21:50,479
when you say there's still a lot to

1865
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:53,000
learn about this crop and there's still

1866
01:21:50,479 --> 01:21:55,789
a lot that you want to learn personally

1867
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:58,010
regarding these tests and cannabis so

1868
01:21:55,789 --> 01:22:00,500
people need to keep that in mind and

1869
01:21:58,010 --> 01:22:02,390
that's I think that's every honest

1870
01:22:00,500 --> 01:22:04,520
consultant out there at this point in

1871
01:22:02,390 --> 01:22:06,789
time and I think a lot of consultants

1872
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:09,770
have been basing their

1873
01:22:06,789 --> 01:22:11,000
recommendations off of like you and I

1874
01:22:09,770 --> 01:22:13,580
talked about today about numbers that

1875
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:17,300
may not tell the whole story and I think

1876
01:22:13,579 --> 01:22:20,329
that's the big takeaway yes exactly you

1877
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:24,289
know and I had a guy i presented down at

1878
01:22:20,329 --> 01:22:26,149
a dallas and then i have guy come in

1879
01:22:24,289 --> 01:22:29,840
from california who says well we run

1880
01:22:26,149 --> 01:22:34,069
tissues every week and and i i thought

1881
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:36,860
wow you know that's a lot of money and

1882
01:22:34,069 --> 01:22:39,219
but I'm not sure you can even make the

1883
01:22:36,859 --> 01:22:41,809
correction within a week

1884
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:44,270
if you've got the results back and then

1885
01:22:41,810 --> 01:22:46,940
you made a application you're going to

1886
01:22:44,270 --> 01:22:50,780
be retesting that with the material on

1887
01:22:46,939 --> 01:22:54,169
the lease so yeah it you can some people

1888
01:22:50,779 --> 01:22:57,229
really go into extreme details I'm I'm

1889
01:22:54,170 --> 01:22:59,000
more success driven and saying well you

1890
01:22:57,229 --> 01:23:00,709
know how's the plan look I'm like you I

1891
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:02,479
like to I like to know the plants are

1892
01:23:00,710 --> 01:23:04,939
healthy they're green they're they're

1893
01:23:02,479 --> 01:23:07,539
growing and and we're not having burnt

1894
01:23:04,939 --> 01:23:09,649
edges on the leaves or what have you so

1895
01:23:07,539 --> 01:23:11,269
yeah and I'm hoping that you and I can

1896
01:23:09,649 --> 01:23:14,269
stay in better touch here moving forward

1897
01:23:11,270 --> 01:23:15,740
to to improve this process along with

1898
01:23:14,270 --> 01:23:17,690
other people that are that are doing

1899
01:23:15,739 --> 01:23:19,039
similar things in this industry so that

1900
01:23:17,689 --> 01:23:21,879
we can all learn to make better

1901
01:23:19,039 --> 01:23:24,140
recommendations down the road but you

1902
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:26,000
know I was gonna say you could look at a

1903
01:23:24,140 --> 01:23:27,770
test like this and say oh wow here's

1904
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:29,390
something to watch like I would watch

1905
01:23:27,770 --> 01:23:32,060
the soluble salts that could potentially

1906
01:23:29,390 --> 01:23:34,190
be the problem that kind of thing yes

1907
01:23:32,060 --> 01:23:36,950
exactly and I think there's ranges that

1908
01:23:34,189 --> 01:23:39,469
we can work at look at I'm hoping to

1909
01:23:36,949 --> 01:23:43,059
work with Logan and and maybe you'd it

1910
01:23:39,470 --> 01:23:45,820
to put together a a little ring binder

1911
01:23:43,060 --> 01:23:49,400
folder or a ring binder

1912
01:23:45,819 --> 01:23:51,769
thing about these soils and what what we

1913
01:23:49,399 --> 01:23:53,929
kind of project these numbers maybe

1914
01:23:51,770 --> 01:23:57,320
should be or should get into these

1915
01:23:53,930 --> 01:23:59,329
ranges and and try to try to narrow them

1916
01:23:57,319 --> 01:24:01,909
down for people so we'll hopefully do

1917
01:23:59,329 --> 01:24:03,409
that by the end of summer that would be

1918
01:24:01,909 --> 01:24:06,170
great I'd love to be a part of that yeah

1919
01:24:03,409 --> 01:24:07,789
I know Erica Ryan heimer has been doing

1920
01:24:06,170 --> 01:24:09,880
a lot of work around this to coming

1921
01:24:07,789 --> 01:24:12,649
working on a calculator around

1922
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:14,270
cannabis as well so I want to mention

1923
01:24:12,649 --> 01:24:17,439
her she's been someone that I've really

1924
01:24:14,270 --> 01:24:20,540
enjoyed chatting with on this subject -
