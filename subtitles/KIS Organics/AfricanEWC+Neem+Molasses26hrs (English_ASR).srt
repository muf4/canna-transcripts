1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,068
okay this is an African Nightcrawler

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:15,138
earthworm castings combined with neem

3
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:18,560
cake and molasses you can see there's it

4
00:00:15,138 --> 00:00:22,710
we're still getting some fungal growth

5
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:27,268
or about 28 hours in right now this is

6
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:33,359
it a hundred times magnification we zoom

7
00:00:27,268 --> 00:00:39,089
in 200 times get an idea of just how

8
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:43,878
much bacterial activity there is the

9
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:46,469
entire here's the fungal fungal hypha

10
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:49,009
but the entire slide looks like this in

11
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:52,789
terms of bacterial activity

12
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:52,789
it's just teeming

13
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:05,280
you're now at 400 times magnification

14
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:17,180
and we looked at the African

15
00:01:12,019 --> 00:01:20,539
nightcrawlers without any any food

16
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:26,990
sources we didn't really see a lot of

17
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:34,659
activity so I am inclined to think that

18
00:01:26,989 --> 00:01:42,439
the neem cake he's a decent food source

19
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:45,560
especially for bacteria here but it

20
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:48,438
doesn't seem to be inhibiting fungal

21
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:57,549
growth as I am seeing it on the slide or

22
00:01:48,438 --> 00:01:57,548
if it is it's minor relatively speaking
