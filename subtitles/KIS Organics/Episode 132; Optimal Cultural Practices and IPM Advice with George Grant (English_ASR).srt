of the

45
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:03,920
cultural uh practic that could uh

46

influence those things uh light light

47
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,640

and the University of Florida so I am

55
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,878
from the south don't really sound like

56
00:02:21,318 --> 00:02:25,919
it too much um I currently live in gold

57
00:02:23,878 --> 00:02:28,280
in Colorado

58
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:29,318
um I'm fortunate I'm fortunate because

59
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,360
I've been blessed with really good

60
00:02:29,318 --> 00:02:32,280
mentors

61
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,319
um basically right after grad school I

62
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,560
met a man named Ricky Ates um and he's

63
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:37,479
very well known in the ornamental

64
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,800
industry um he was the head of the

65
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:41,238
technical department for Griffin

66
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,599
greenhouse supplies Griffin is a

67
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:44,519
nationwide distributor for plant

68
00:02:42,598 --> 00:02:46,679
products both in the hard goods and live

69
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:49,120
Goods side of things um we've been very

70
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,239
heavily involved with CA ornamentals and

71
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,360
cannabis over the last several years um

72
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:55,000
and Rick basically just took me under

73
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:56,239
rer wing and um showed me that it's

74
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,120
showed me all the things I didn't know

75
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,000
and all the things that I could

76
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,519
potentially know so I've got a a great

77
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,840
team around me

78
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:04,280
um couldn't don't have enough so many

79
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,840
things great to say about Griffin and

80
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,318
the family culture that they they bring

81
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,120
um but what I really love about my job

82
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:11,759
is I and I tell Growers this and they

83
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,680
don't really like it but I I get to

84
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:15,719
share all the success but none of the

85
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,080
stress of growing I I realized quickly

86
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:19,680
in grad school that I just couldn't I

87
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,280
couldn't sleep at night knowing I had a

88
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,040
crop in the greenhouse um but I realized

89
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:28,560
that I do love the problem solving

90
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:31,079
aspects of of of helping Growers it's I

91
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,920
have no idea what's going to happen when

92
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,959
that phone call Rings or that email pops

93
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:36,839
up it could be anything and that's what

94
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,438
I love about this job so I get to learn

95
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,878
a little bit about everything relates to

96
00:03:39,438 --> 00:03:43,680
crop protection nutrition uh cultural

97
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:45,239
practices you name it and also at the

98
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,760
same time we get to understand what are

99
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:49,158
the new trends that are developing

100
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:52,318
across the various Industries so I'm

101
00:03:49,158 --> 00:03:54,438
very blessed and very grateful for my

102
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:56,679
position yeah that's awesome so you get

103
00:03:54,438 --> 00:03:58,680
to hear all of the challenges that are

104
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,280
happening uh with the Growers that you

105
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,640
work with um

106
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,959
what what sort of commonalities do you

107
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:06,958
see around that are there you know

108
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,120
common issues or problems that seem to

109
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:12,280
arrive arise

110
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,239
consistently yeah absolutely I mean it's

111
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:16,439
growing plants in general is not c as

112
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,199
cookie cutter as people may think every

113
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:19,839
operation's different every every

114
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:21,560
culture meaning the people that are

115
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,918
involved the stakeholders everything is

116
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,120
different also the state in which

117
00:04:22,918 --> 00:04:27,639
they're growing is different so I would

118
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,720
say as far as the major source of

119
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:31,960
problems that we typically get is people

120
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,400
people uh have a problem and that could

121
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:34,799
be pest or disease related and they

122
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:36,679
don't know what tools they have

123
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,720
available and when I say tools I mean

124
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:41,240
both from a cultural aspect as well as a

125
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,240
chemical aspect as you know cannabis is

126
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,639
still relatively you know even though

127
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,360
people think it's it's got a very

128
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,079
defined culture and in some ways it does

129
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,240
but for most of the country it's still

130
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:52,639
relatively new crop and from a legal

131
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,038
side it's very new so uh state

132
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,720
governments are still trying to figure

133
00:04:54,038 --> 00:04:58,399
out what pesticides can and cannot be

134
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:00,400
used I I often times see Growers trying

135
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:02,719
to use a product that isn't approved

136
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:04,638
legally and then again they might use it

137
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,039
in a way that's that's not that they

138
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:09,160
shouldn't be using using it on I mean if

139
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:10,719
we you mentioned Mike in his research I

140
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,800
think is very groundbreaking a lot of

141
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,759
the research coming out of Academia

142
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,680
relates to fertilizer and cultural

143
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:18,720
practices nowadays but there's hardly

144
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,120
any research coming out on the crop

145
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,720
protection side of things specifically

146
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:24,959
to cannabis so um I'm I'm I'm fueling

147
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,039
that whenever I get the opportunity to

148
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:29,279
speak I'm trying to tell Growers to do

149
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:31,519
internal trials control trials as well

150
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:33,519
as our vendor Partners we work with B

151
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:35,399
basically every major vendor from a crop

152
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:37,279
protection standpoint Under the Sun and

153
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:38,879
so I'm I'm urging them to do do

154
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:40,478
controlled trials on cannabis

155
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:42,240
specifically because Growers want to

156
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:44,758
know what is working what is not what is

157
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,720
safe and what is not so phyto toxicity

158
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:48,919
concerns are very common practice a lot

159
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,360
of times we grow in an indoor

160
00:05:48,918 --> 00:05:52,879
environment and Growers don't understand

161
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,240
may not understand how to apply a

162
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:56,439
pesticide correctly in a very uh

163
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:59,079
controlled environment versus a

164
00:05:56,439 --> 00:06:00,519
greenhouse or even outdoor so um each of

165
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:02,439
those each each of those contexual

166
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:04,758
factors

167
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:06,279
play well let's cover that a little bit

168
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:08,360
then so if we're talking about a

169
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:12,758
pesticide and I guess it doesn't really

170
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:15,759
matter what that pesticide is um and

171
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:16,960
correct me here as we go uh but want to

172
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,720
make sure we're always applying to the

173
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:23,839
label rate where we've read the uh MSDS

174
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,479
or SDS around that product to know what

175
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:30,000
how to use it safely um and we have the

176
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:32,800
proper PPE and protection in place and

177
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,120
that the application rate is established

178
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,199
to give you maximum efficacy at the

179
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,319
lowest concentration and the least risk

180
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:42,960
of photoxicity so it's always important

181
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:46,160
to apply to application rate to avoid um

182
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:47,839
creating insect resistance to that

183
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:52,319
whatever that chemistry is assuming it's

184
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:53,879
a chemistry and not an oil um anything

185
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,400
anything you would change in that those

186
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:58,639
statements or anything you would add to

187
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:00,159
that no but I would definitely agree

188
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,199
with you the label is law and that's

189
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,720
something we stand behind all the time

190
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:05,680
um and I'm not afraid to tell Growers

191
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,680
that as well it's just frankly it's it's

192
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,598
just you know it is what it is um

193
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:12,199
resistance is a major issue regardless

194
00:07:10,598 --> 00:07:14,719
of what plant you're growing I think

195
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:16,319
what's advantageous for cannabis Growers

196
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,120
is most of the products that are

197
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,800
approved for cannabis use are what we

198
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,918
call quote unquote soft chemistry or

199
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:26,199
microbial based chemistries so your

200
00:07:22,918 --> 00:07:29,839
Bavaria your aeras your Aid duratin um

201
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:32,360
so illus very important so those those

202
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:35,359
Mo those active ingredients typically

203
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,800
don't deal with resistance issues like

204
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,919
we do with hard chemistry or

205
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,160
conventional chemistry so I think that's

206
00:07:38,918 --> 00:07:43,478
advantageous but that doesn't downplay

207
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:45,599
the fact that we should be rotating um

208
00:07:43,478 --> 00:07:48,158
depending on the situation I mean when

209
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:50,120
I'm talking I work with Canabis grows

210
00:07:48,158 --> 00:07:51,360
almost every single day and I can tell

211
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,840
you the main ones are going to be it's

212
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,520
going to be uh either it's going to be a

213
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:57,000
root AIT it's going to be a cannabis AIT

214
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:59,959
it's either going to be a thrip

215
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,759
spidermite um powder M or Bettis

216
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:03,359
and so there's a lot of overlap from

217
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,560
what an ornamental grower will deal with

218
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,520
as well as a cannabis grower

219
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,680
unfortunately the toolkit is just much

220
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:09,680
much smaller when we're working with

221
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,840
cannabis yeah well you listed a whole

222
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:16,318
bunch of different um challenges in

223
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:17,719
cannabis do you want to dive into any

224
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,598
one of those in

225
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:22,720
particular

226
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:24,399
um yeah absolutely I mean just let's

227
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,560
just talk about microbials for a moment

228
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:28,560
so most of the microbials that we use

229
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,319
they do very well in high humid

230
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,559
relatively cool temperatures high

231
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,599
humidity environments and that's almost

232
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:37,399
exactly opposite of what we're trying to

233
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:39,519
achieve in an indoor grow operation um

234
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:42,958
we're usually shooting for highl very

235
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:46,560
low extremely low relative humidi um and

236
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:49,439
so things dry out um and that microbials

237
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:51,199
work the same way so if I do when I'm

238
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,040
working with a grower it's very

239
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,440
important they understand how to manage

240
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:57,120
their agac system so and this actually

241
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,440
kind of goes back to phto as well so

242
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,519
when I a general rule of thumb when

243
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,720
applying any type P side is I want it to

244
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:04,278
be less than 80 degrees in that growing

245
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,160
environment and I want relatively

246
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:09,679
relatively low humidity so it dries

247
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:11,240
relatively quickly U microbials work a

248
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:13,120
little bit differently though they they

249
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:15,079
do want to be applied at a a cooler

250
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,078
temperature but a slower drying

251
00:09:15,078 --> 00:09:19,039
condition or greater relative humidity

252
00:09:17,078 --> 00:09:20,479
allows for them to do better if it's

253
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:21,480
fungal based they're going to sporulate

254
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,039
if they're bacterial based they're going

255
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:26,600
to populate more um and they're going to

256
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:28,319
stay on that insect for longer so I want

257
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,680
I try to work with Growers and make sure

258
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,839
they understand when they're doing an

259
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:33,639
application or a series of applications

260
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,680
that they're they're managing their HVAC

261
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:37,720
system so they maxifi maximize the

262
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:40,399
efficacy of those

263
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:42,720
pesticides yeah o oils are a great

264
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:45,200
example of something that can easily

265
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,839
burn cannabis and that's that that

266
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,000
temperature and light intensity sort of

267
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,320
parameter needs to be dialed in um

268
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,958
that's why a lot of Growers are going I

269
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,920
mean not just the only reason but one of

270
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:57,838
the reasons why people are going to

271
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:59,919
dimable LEDs or adjustable intensity

272
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,360
LEDs is is they can lower the light

273
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:04,360
intensity so there's less actually light

274
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:07,079
intensity or light stress potentially on

275
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:09,079
that plant when an pet application is

276
00:10:07,078 --> 00:10:11,239
made until it's

277
00:10:09,078 --> 00:10:15,159
dried yeah I just want to remind folks

278
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:16,360
too that oils and sulfur do not mix um

279
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:19,399
and frankly I think there's better

280
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:22,159
options than sulfur uh in cannabis in

281
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:23,839
most cases but um I just want to throw

282
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:25,480
that out there as well and and one thing

283
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,560
that you touched on with humidity I

284
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:29,480
wanted to talk about a little bit

285
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:33,799
because um I'm seeing people running a

286
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:36,680
higher RH now that we're as a community

287
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:39,159
more informed and learning and

288
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:42,039
understanding VPD um so like I use the

289
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:44,399
VPD chart from Dr Greenhouse Nadia Dr

290
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:47,120
Nadia SAA um I know there's a lot of

291
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:50,159
great ones out there but given that

292
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,039
we're running you know slightly higher

293
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:56,039
humidity at least in veg and through

294
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:59,958
most of flour does that allow for better

295
00:10:56,039 --> 00:11:02,159
usage of a lot of these pesticides then

296
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:04,958
yeah I would say from my cral standpoint

297
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:08,319
absolutely

298
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:11,078
um we don't want to I mean it I wouldn't

299
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,480
be surprised if we have heart we have

300
00:11:11,078 --> 00:11:14,199
greater pest pressure and disease

301
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,920
pressure when we run relative higher

302
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:19,560
relative humidities but it's much better

303
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:22,120
just it's going going we were going from

304
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:23,838
like 20% 40% relative humidity

305
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:26,399
incredibly low relative humidities to

306
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,880
Now 50 is 60 um and even a little bit

307
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:31,360
higher if especially in a greenhouse

308
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:33,039
situation um so I think it's it's better

309
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,600
um just because we're not not stressing

310
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:37,919
out the plan as

311
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:41,600
much yeah as a side know I did a

312
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:42,639
interview with uh Nicole go I'm actually

313
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,839
following up with her she's a

314
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:45,440
pathologist at the University of

315
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,240
Kentucky Kentucky and she was saying

316
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,720
that one of the two species of powdery

317
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:56,039
milder that in infects in cannabis can

318
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:57,959
actually sporulate at 40% humidity um so

319
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:59,439
even lowering humidity you're now you're

320
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:00,919
stressing the plant and you're still at

321
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,200
risk if you have this particular species

322
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:05,199
of PM um you're creating optimal

323
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,720
conditions for it to reproduce which I

324
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,839
thought was really interesting

325
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:12,639
um but um I believe it I mean we get

326
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:16,440
pattery Milo here in Colorado and people

327
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:18,198
think we're incredibly dry the i i

328
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:20,240
people need to think about and I think

329
00:12:18,198 --> 00:12:22,479
we I love how the cultures between

330
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,879
ornamentals and cannabis is going at fir

331
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,399
at first I believe there was quite a bit

332
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:28,399
of tension but I think now we're we're

333
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:31,039
starting to to learn from each other as

334
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,958
we get closer into integrated in the and

335
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:33,278
and I think it's important because

336
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:35,518
cannabis Growers are going to need to

337
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:37,439
learn more about Greenhouse production

338
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,120
as that becomes more of a norm I mean

339
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,000
for example with powdering mildew we

340
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,639
know just from Greenhouse production

341
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,799
that it's typically it rears its head

342
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:47,360
most on the shoulders of the season so

343
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:49,639
from Winter to Spring and then basically

344
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,800
summer to fall it's those transitional

345
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:54,360
times where pow Mill just tends pressure

346
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:57,198
just tends to a Skyrocket so I I like

347
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:59,440
that we're learning from each other and

348
00:12:57,198 --> 00:13:01,000
communicating yeah yeah no that's great

349
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,639
and I want to just also touch on you

350
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,879
brought up a really good point around

351
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:07,198
light intensity because a lot of the

352
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:10,240
research coming out by Dr Bruce bugby

353
00:13:07,198 --> 00:13:13,120
now is is showing higher light intensity

354
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:16,759
can increase yields um and he's pushing

355
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,320
the envelope pretty high in terms of uh

356
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:21,278
par or

357
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,720
ppfd I would assume that as people start

358
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:26,639
running higher light intensity we do

359
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:29,199
need to dim it down to avoid

360
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:32,079
phytotoxicity because I like when I do

361
00:13:29,198 --> 00:13:35,479
an application of like seoil X for

362
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:38,078
example um I don't always consider what

363
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:39,720
my light intensity is uh because I have

364
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:41,479
never really pushed it that high but if

365
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:43,920
I were to run a higher light light

366
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:45,839
intensity I would want to you know

367
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:47,078
potentially dial it down and and also do

368
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,320
you want to talk about when we should be

369
00:13:47,078 --> 00:13:51,239
spraying during the light cycle I think

370
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:53,160
that's another important aspect

371
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:56,440
depending on absolutely actually there's

372
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:57,759
exact question up today it in general

373
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,839
ideally if I was in a greenhouse

374
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:02,079
situation I'd be I ideally wanting to

375
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,880
apply in the morning hours so light

376
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:05,758
intensities are relatively low they're

377
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:07,879
increasing but they're relatively low

378
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:10,000
humidity is rela it can be can

379
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:12,919
definitely start high and then start go

380
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,639
go down as the as the sun rises but what

381
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:15,879
I it's preferable to be in the morning

382
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,519
because we still have cool enough

383
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:21,480
conditions for phyto to be reduced but

384
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:23,120
then also we we ensure that we're we're

385
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,920
going to have it dried out we're not

386
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,039
going to go into the evening hours or

387
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:29,399
dark time hours with wet foliage or wet

388
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:31,240
flowers that's never advantageous now

389
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:33,399
the the flip side of that the the reason

390
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:35,039
why it logistically doesn't always occur

391
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:37,480
in the why spraying doesn't occur in the

392
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:39,519
morning hours is because of REI so you

393
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,519
know T depending on the pesticide it can

394
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:43,720
range from anywhere from four hours to

395
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,799
12 hours or even four even 24 hours

396
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:48,120
depending on the chemistry luckily most

397
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:50,919
of our organic or softer chemistries

398
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:53,198
have very low Reis so that does kind of

399
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:55,120
free up the the situation but if I spray

400
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:56,879
something still have to follow the REI

401
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:00,360
and I can't handle that plant for x

402
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:02,120
amount of hours until that REI is over

403
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:04,120
uh and for those unfamiliar REI stands

404
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,919
for return entry interval so it's the

405
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:08,278
amount of time before you can go back

406
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:11,559
into that space after spraying

407
00:15:08,278 --> 00:15:14,838
whatever the particular pesticide or

408
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:18,319
spray was so just want to let folks

409
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:20,839
know um well interesting

410
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:25,079
so like you said you you get a lot of

411
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:26,680
stuff around um it sounds like pathogens

412
00:15:25,078 --> 00:15:29,599
what about with pest pressure like are

413
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:32,239
you seeing a lot with um

414
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:35,360
I don't know hempress it right now or or

415
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:38,278
any uh any particular might

416
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,919
pressure someone once asked me if you is

417
00:15:38,278 --> 00:15:42,318
there ever a situation when you're an

418
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:45,639
indoor grower where you can completely

419
00:15:42,318 --> 00:15:48,519
100% eliminate pests um and I told them

420
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:51,000
it's most likely not feasible because

421
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:52,519
somebody is either entering or exiting

422
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,198
that building or product is either

423
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:56,679
entering or exiting the building and

424
00:15:54,198 --> 00:15:59,240
that's the sole reason reason why we end

425
00:15:56,679 --> 00:16:01,039
up having an infestation a lot of these

426
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:03,720
indoor operations are very buttoned up

427
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:06,399
very very tight but unfortunately

428
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:09,079
employees do do a great job of kind of

429
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:11,480
transferring pest um into a facility I

430
00:16:09,078 --> 00:16:13,278
mean broad mites spidermites hosam might

431
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,759
they're all great hitchhikers they will

432
00:16:13,278 --> 00:16:17,679
jump onto or whenever an employee rubs

433
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,360
up against that that plant that has that

434
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:21,359
pest they do a great job of clinging

435
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:24,480
onto them and then moving throughout the

436
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:27,440
the production space so um obviously

437
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,199
sanitation and are trying to prevent any

438
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,959
type of pest entering facilties is very

439
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:33,159
important

440
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:35,518
um yeah I mean hemp Russ might has been

441
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:37,318
around for some time I mean it it I

442
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,639
think it was a really big issue maybe

443
00:16:37,318 --> 00:16:41,879
two years ago um when it started really

444
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:44,079
affecting everyone but the reality is is

445
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:45,600
once you have a hessit might issue that

446
00:16:44,078 --> 00:16:47,359
what I'd like to tell Growers similar

447
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,079
with broad mites broad mites are just as

448
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,879
hard because you can't see them H might

449
00:16:49,078 --> 00:16:52,958
very difficult to see broad might same

450
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:54,318
way you typically see the damage first

451
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:56,638
and then you like realize you have then

452
00:16:54,318 --> 00:16:58,479
have an infant station so a lot of what

453
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,720
I don't and this is going to probably

454
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,240
really make some people not feel good

455
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,120
but the best way to start out with a dis

456
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,880
an issue like that infestation is is

457
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:08,759
coing plants and when I say coing I

458
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,679
means throwing out plants that have the

459
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:12,439
highest pest pressure you are going to

460
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:15,919
spend more money and resources and have

461
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:17,480
an much uper battle trying to solve an

462
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:19,759
infestation when you've got just a

463
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:21,599
select few plants that have the are the

464
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:23,720
source of that problem you really need

465
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:25,240
to throw out or destroy those plants and

466
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:27,558
then do start your pesti side

467
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,919
applications a lot of people don't don't

468
00:17:27,558 --> 00:17:30,000
consider doing that because they want to

469
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:32,200
they want to try to save every plant

470
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,599
they can but it's just something to

471
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:36,558
think about especially if you're growing

472
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:38,038
a large amount of plants um feel free to

473
00:17:36,558 --> 00:17:39,798
throw away a few plants if they're the

474
00:17:38,038 --> 00:17:41,879
most symptomatic physically reducing

475
00:17:39,798 --> 00:17:44,160
aulum is actually a very powerful tool I

476
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:46,360
don't see enough Growers

477
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,038
use yeah you don't hear that suggested

478
00:17:46,359 --> 00:17:51,879
very often so you're saying if there's a

479
00:17:48,038 --> 00:17:53,759
hot spot in a room rather than trying to

480
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:56,200
spray it or or let's just say you're in

481
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:58,319
flower you know midflower to where you

482
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,798
can't really pistol pistol growth is

483
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:04,200
already happening you can't really spray

484
00:18:00,798 --> 00:18:07,599
anything um beneficials take a little

485
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,919
bit longer I mean um the classic example

486
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:10,519
is by the time you have webbing if

487
00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:13,000
you're in flower with spidermites it's

488
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:14,319
already too late like you're not you're

489
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,200
not GNA be able to fix it so you're

490
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:19,439
saying just take them out reduce that

491
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,600
overall pressure and then come up with a

492
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,279
plan for the rest of the

493
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:26,879
crop yeah absolutely I mean you said it

494
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:29,038
you said it very well

495
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,120
um it it works on the same in the

496
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:33,038
ornamental side of things and cannabis

497
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:34,918
is not necessarily able to do this but

498
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:37,759
on ornamentals let's say I've got a

499
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:39,559
sweet potato vine very common ornamental

500
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:41,400
um that is an attracted to a lot of

501
00:18:39,558 --> 00:18:44,240
different pests that also affects

502
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,679
cannabis so when I've got broad mites

503
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,000
and Broad mites and mites in general

504
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,440
really interesting because they what

505
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,839
you'll see when you look at the damage

506
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,840
is that the older growth more

507
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:53,839
established growth doesn't seem that

508
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:56,240
symptomatic or damage but as you move up

509
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:57,678
into the plant to the mor static areas

510
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,640
you actually see the damage get worse

511
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,919
and worse and what happening is the m

512
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,640
species are actually moving up to the

513
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:04,679
new growth they're reproducing in

514
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,559
Greater number and causing more damage

515
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:09,440
but what we sometimes do in ornamentals

516
00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:10,960
if it's allowable is I cut off the

517
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,759
affected portions of the plant where

518
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,000
those mites are present and just

519
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:16,480
basically destroy that material by and

520
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,919
essentially I'm pinching it I'm pinching

521
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,400
that plant then allowing the lateral

522
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:22,400
growth the underneath growth to then

523
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,000
expand and the mites are not present

524
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,280
there so that's just a that's a small

525
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,038
cultural method and it doesn't really

526
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:29,119
make sense for most cannabis situations

527
00:19:27,038 --> 00:19:31,759
unless I was talking about mother stock

528
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:33,759
that might make sense in that

529
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:35,440
situation yeah if you're early enough in

530
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:37,240
veg too that you can just kind of lower

531
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,798
your canopy I could see that if you did

532
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:43,159
across the board um but yeah I've always

533
00:19:39,798 --> 00:19:46,639
thought of uh hempd or broad broad might

534
00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:48,600
damage is sort of that Twisted new green

535
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,720
growth a little bit lighter green

536
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:52,678
coloring too almost like a iron

537
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:56,480
deficiency but then the leaves will do

538
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:58,919
this sort of twisting Distortion to them

539
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:01,240
um and then you really need to get out

540
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:02,679
scope um and make sure it's you can't

541
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,000
just use your phone you need like a dino

542
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:05,559
light or something that's going to give

543
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,640
you a little better magnification and

544
00:20:05,558 --> 00:20:10,038
and a little better Clarity to really

545
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:14,400
see it at least in my

546
00:20:10,038 --> 00:20:16,640
experience oh yeah 100% um you know we

547
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,720
work a lot we work a lot off photos and

548
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,600
and and phone calls and so people get

549
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,120
really creative on their adjectives they

550
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:24,719
use to describe symptoms um and some and

551
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:27,439
some Growers aren't comfortable um

552
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:30,440
sharing photos which is perfectly fine

553
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,880
um but what what I like to think about

554
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,840
what I like to ask the Growers what's

555
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:35,840
the uniformity of the issue when I walk

556
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:37,918
into a situation first thing I want to

557
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:39,839
know is is it an abiotic issue or a

558
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,840
biotic issue well everything we've been

559
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:43,798
talking about thus far are biotic issues

560
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:45,558
they're they're caused by living things

561
00:20:43,798 --> 00:20:48,279
and typically when we have a biotic

562
00:20:45,558 --> 00:20:50,678
issue it the uniformity is not not

563
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:52,798
incredibly uniform so if it was a

564
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:54,720
fertilizer issue or a nutritional issue

565
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:56,679
it's going to affect all the all all the

566
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,038
plants relatively the same way because

567
00:20:56,679 --> 00:21:01,080
they're all receiving the same input if

568
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:03,480
same with phyto like a phytotoxicity

569
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:05,759
event if I sprayed something and the it

570
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:07,839
was way too hot or I played something

571
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:09,960
and it wasn't a correct rate it's going

572
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:12,158
to damage those plants uniformally thus

573
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,960
that leans me that makes me think okay

574
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,880
this is going to be an abiotic issue

575
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:18,200
whereas biotic issues tend to be much

576
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:20,559
more localized or spread out more

577
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:22,759
randomly throughout a production

578
00:21:20,558 --> 00:21:25,918
area yeah that's a good point I just

579
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:29,158
want to point out some um other things

580
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:31,038
to consider like uh it could be an aoic

581
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:33,120
issue if you had like a fan for example

582
00:21:31,038 --> 00:21:35,000
in a corner that was creating a

583
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:38,319
different air pocket that maybe allowed

584
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,519
pm to start uh growing uh so your

585
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:43,200
abiotic issue could be creating your

586
00:21:40,519 --> 00:21:45,038
biotic problem to a certain extent and a

587
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,400
lot of times plant stress whether that's

588
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:50,720
from fertilizer uh deficiencies or

589
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,038
excesses can lead especially around

590
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,480
nitrogen can lead to higher pest

591
00:21:52,038 --> 00:21:56,679
pressure so uh these things are all

592
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,558
really interconnected just making it way

593
00:21:56,679 --> 00:21:59,679
more complicated but I but you're right

594
00:21:58,558 --> 00:22:01,200
you have to be detective when you walk

595
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:03,480
in the room just like if you're looking

596
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,000
at it from a nutrient perspective we

597
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,798
want to know where is this issue

598
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,119
occurring is it the entire plan is it a

599
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:11,400
mobile nutrient is it an immobile

600
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:15,278
nutrient like um I always like people to

601
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:16,919
send me photos of the issue and then

602
00:22:15,278 --> 00:22:18,278
also the whole plant and even the whole

603
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:19,759
room so we can really get an idea of

604
00:22:18,278 --> 00:22:22,599
what's going

605
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:25,919
on I could give you an entire album of

606
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:28,639
poor photos I I don't know what it is um

607
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:30,720
but we just get I mean and it is what it

608
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,520
is but it's amazing some of these one

609
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:35,440
leaf photos on the hand or uh just a

610
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:37,519
very blurry photo but if you're ever

611
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,120
working with us or any tech technical

612
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:41,558
specialist please just take the time to

613
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:43,479
send a few clear photos and like you

614
00:22:41,558 --> 00:22:45,399
said Ted whole plant photos we want to

615
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:46,759
see the tops we want to see the bottoms

616
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:49,038
oftentimes if something especially

617
00:22:46,759 --> 00:22:50,319
nutritionally if something's affecting

618
00:22:49,038 --> 00:22:52,038
or disease related if something's

619
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:54,038
affecting the top we want to look at the

620
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:55,720
roots immediately to see if it if that's

621
00:22:54,038 --> 00:22:58,679
like you said the primary issue leading

622
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:00,000
to a secondary issue that we're seeing

623
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:02,440
yeah that's another great Point people

624
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,759
should absolutely kick a pot out of the

625
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:05,840
out of the container and take a look at

626
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:07,359
the roots or dig into their bed or their

627
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:09,918
or their container and see what's going

628
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:11,798
on there um I think people forget about

629
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:15,120
that a lot of times I forget about it

630
00:23:11,798 --> 00:23:18,240
sometimes um but there's a lot of root

631
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:21,239
pathogens that we need to rule out um

632
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,240
and so that's that's a great

633
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:28,240
suggestion um cool well what um what are

634
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:30,000
you seeing around uh so we've talked a

635
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,919
lot like pest pressures and things like

636
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,079
that but what sort of cultural practices

637
00:23:32,919 --> 00:23:36,840
are you seeing uh being implemented that

638
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:40,399
are being most effective or or giving

639
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:40,399
Growers the the best chance of

640
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:46,320
success let me tell you what not is not

641
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:48,240
being implemented um because I think

642
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:50,720
that's more important the things that

643
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,400
the the these are standard practices

644
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,240
that are used in the ornamental side

645
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,038
that I believe should be utilized or at

646
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,759
least adopted and tri on the Cannabis

647
00:23:56,038 --> 00:24:01,879
side of things one is called dip and one

648
00:23:58,759 --> 00:24:04,558
is called diff so we have dip and D if

649
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:07,240
I'll first talk about diff first so we

650
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:09,918
can manipulate plant stretching or

651
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:11,880
architecture by adjusting the average

652
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,799
daily temperature daytime temperature

653
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:15,600
and average nightly temperature the

654
00:24:13,798 --> 00:24:17,720
difference between those averages if

655
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:19,678
there's a more positive diff meaning

656
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:21,400
there's a greater day temperature than a

657
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:22,720
night temperature the greater that

658
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:25,200
difference the more we're going to get

659
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:27,120
imp plant stretching the less difference

660
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,960
we get so if I had a diff of zero

661
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:30,398
meaning that my average day temperature

662
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,079
and average night temperature are the

663
00:24:30,398 --> 00:24:35,839
exact same then we can we can basically

664
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:37,359
reduce stretching or even in situations

665
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:39,199
this is primarily done in indoor

666
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:41,839
situations where I can have a negative

667
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:44,679
diff I can have I can actually have a

668
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:46,199
higher night a higher night temperature

669
00:24:44,679 --> 00:24:48,559
than my daytime temperature and I can

670
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,519
create more of a stunted plant I not

671
00:24:48,558 --> 00:24:52,158
seeing that Tri and I would love to see

672
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:54,278
how that affects plant basically

673
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:56,399
vegetative uh vegetative architecture as

674
00:24:54,278 --> 00:24:58,000
well as flower architecture so that's

675
00:24:56,398 --> 00:24:59,959
diff and that's a very common practice

676
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,398
used ornamentals something that's a

677
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:05,880
slight offset of that is called dip di

678
00:25:03,398 --> 00:25:08,038
dip and what happens is and this is

679
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:10,240
primarily more important for uh

680
00:25:08,038 --> 00:25:12,640
Greenhouse or outdoor situations is that

681
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,480
we know from research that the first few

682
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,679
hours about three hours as the sun is

683
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,960
rising lower light intensities and the

684
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:20,600
quality of the light is different and

685
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,880
majority of plant stretch actually

686
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:24,798
occurs in the first three hours of

687
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,159
Daybreak and so what Growers will do on

688
00:25:24,798 --> 00:25:28,119
the ornamental side is they will

689
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:30,080
actually drop their night their their

690
00:25:28,119 --> 00:25:32,000
their temperatures in the greenhouse by

691
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:33,639
about 5 degrees lower than what their

692
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,640
average night temperature is so we've

693
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:36,880
got the sun rising for about three hours

694
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,200
and during this time the plant is

695
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,000
starting to wake up it's starting to

696
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,200
become photosynthetically active but

697
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,079
because of the light intensity itself

698
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,278
and the quality it's wanting to stretch

699
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:46,918
very very much so and so we can reduce

700
00:25:45,278 --> 00:25:48,960
that ability or that plant's ability to

701
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:50,799
want to stretch by dropping the night

702
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,440
dropping that temperature and creating

703
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:54,639
sort of a cold stress to prevent that

704
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:57,240
stretch from from happening so those are

705
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:59,399
two cultural practices I don't see used

706
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,558
and I don't even see it side in in

707
00:25:59,398 --> 00:26:04,759
literature related to cannabis yet but I

708
00:26:01,558 --> 00:26:06,599
do I foresee that happening in the

709
00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:09,359
future wow yeah that's really

710
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:11,119
interesting I I'm familiar with diff

711
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:12,759
though I haven't really thought of the

712
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:14,879
implications within cannabis which is

713
00:26:12,759 --> 00:26:17,558
kind of crazy when you when you say it

714
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:20,240
like that because it it does seem it

715
00:26:17,558 --> 00:26:22,278
does seem worth trialing um and the dip

716
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,359
thing I haven't I had even heard of so

717
00:26:22,278 --> 00:26:25,919
yeah I hope people would take that up as

718
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:30,240
some research because I think that could

719
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:30,240
be that could be really interesting um

720
00:26:30,278 --> 00:26:32,720
I I don't know of anyone running a

721
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:37,000
negative diff in

722
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:39,519
cannabis and I also wonder how CO2 plays

723
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,319
a role if any in that in the fact that

724
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:46,079
we have such great amounts of CO2

725
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:47,720
production happening at night um

726
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:49,439
especially in these living soil Beds

727
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:51,278
which is sort of the realm that that I

728
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,399
work in

729
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:55,200
um yeah yeah I think that's interesting

730
00:26:53,398 --> 00:26:56,839
I need to think about that a little bit

731
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:00,080
thank you for sharing

732
00:26:56,839 --> 00:27:03,678
that um what other what other cultural

733
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:05,480
practices are you seeing really being um

734
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:07,200
maybe done wrong or things that you you

735
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:09,278
hear

736
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,919
continually that are just little

737
00:27:09,278 --> 00:27:11,960
mistakes that you think people could

738
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:15,480
could

739
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:16,798
avoid well I think uh overwatering

740
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:18,360
cannabis can easily be an issue and

741
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:21,119
underwatering cannabis can easily be an

742
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:23,119
issue um I a lot of research that's

743
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:25,759
going to come out in the next couple

744
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:29,359
years is they're going to use certain

745
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:30,759
crops as model crops for cannabis poia

746
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:33,199
like you said Mikel Alden did a good

747
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:35,480
he's equated kind of poinas as a model

748
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,960
crop for poincettia for cannabis and

749
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:38,919
they do have a lot of overlap but

750
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,640
poinsettia is is a crop that doesn't

751
00:27:38,919 --> 00:27:42,080
like a lot of change I when I I work

752
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,000
with a lot of can a lot of poinsettia

753
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:45,519
Growers and I tell them if you're if

754
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,640
you're going to be a drive grower be a

755
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:48,679
drrive grower if you're going to be a

756
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:51,200
wet grower be a wet grower do not change

757
00:27:48,679 --> 00:27:52,640
your T don't change your tactics um

758
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,480
really Midway through the crop now I

759
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,159
know a lot of people do deer do dry down

760
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:58,839
steering and there's there's a lot of

761
00:27:57,159 --> 00:28:00,320
information regarding that but in

762
00:27:58,839 --> 00:28:01,480
general if we're talking just mass

763
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:05,839
production of

764
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:08,038
cannabis you're you're safer being more

765
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:10,639
more routine in your irrigation

766
00:28:08,038 --> 00:28:11,919
practices and I think one way people are

767
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,399
sort of getting around there are

768
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:16,399
providing some buffer to poor irrigation

769
00:28:14,398 --> 00:28:18,879
management is converting to Pete I mean

770
00:28:16,398 --> 00:28:20,959
Pete Pete Moss as far as a growing media

771
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:23,760
has become much more accepted over the

772
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,360
last couple years as as the before the

773
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:27,440
traditional ways of growing and still

774
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:29,918
are very prominent as core and grow down

775
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:32,360
or Rock W and obviously living soil as

776
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:34,559
you said that's a complete different

777
00:28:32,359 --> 00:28:36,599
complete different situation but I do

778
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:37,839
see a lot of Growers converting to Pete

779
00:28:36,599 --> 00:28:39,839
both from a moisture management

780
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:41,278
standpoint reason as well as from a

781
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:43,879
nutritional standpoint it obviously has

782
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:45,480
a much higher CC um or cation exchange

783
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:47,600
capacity meaning it holds on in

784
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:49,480
nutrition much more heavily compared to

785
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:52,038
something like core or groden which is

786
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:52,038
relatively in

787
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:57,320
nerd I I mean I like P just because the

788
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:01,200
lower pH allows me to front load a lot

789
00:28:57,319 --> 00:29:03,240
of nutrients into the into the soil mix

790
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,399
uh prior to planting which is something

791
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:06,159
with core where you're already starting

792
00:29:04,398 --> 00:29:08,518
at seven most of the inputs that are

793
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:12,679
have I want to add or cat ions or their

794
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:14,599
alkaline it just uh pushes my pH out of

795
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:16,360
range that's my biggest reason for

796
00:29:14,599 --> 00:29:17,839
liking Pete and I I think it's more

797
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:20,839
sustainable Than People realize I've

798
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:22,480
seen some interesting uh research around

799
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:24,959
the replenishment of pee pogs I'm not

800
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,240
saying it's perfect but I I think you

801
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,440
could easily make the argument for it

802
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:30,798
over cocoa core in a lot of ways with

803
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:34,159
the amount of fossil fuel and

804
00:29:30,798 --> 00:29:36,158
ecological uh damage Associated around

805
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:38,960
core

806
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:40,480
production yeah well whatever prod

807
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:43,038
whatever input you use for your growing

808
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,798
media it's it's it's one of the most

809
00:29:43,038 --> 00:29:47,240
important ones so whoever you're buying

810
00:29:44,798 --> 00:29:48,440
it through it needs to be a very quality

811
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:52,200
product it needs to go through a very

812
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:54,000
rigorous QA QC process um because you

813
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,679
don't want product that event

814
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,919
unfortunately let's say I mean core for

815
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:59,720
example there are some core core sources

816
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:01,559
that that would not be buffered meaning

817
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:03,798
they haven't been leeched typically with

818
00:30:01,558 --> 00:30:06,038
either clear water or calcium nitrate to

819
00:30:03,798 --> 00:30:08,038
basically rinse out the excessive salts

820
00:30:06,038 --> 00:30:10,278
that are in that media during the

821
00:30:08,038 --> 00:30:13,839
process of the processing of that media

822
00:30:10,278 --> 00:30:16,398
so it just I think Pete in general it's

823
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:18,798
been around for so long and a lot of the

824
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:20,719
major producers of Pete they have very

825
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:23,158
good processes and typically the quality

826
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,200
is reliable I do like that I like that

827
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:26,519
as

828
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:28,840
well yeah I think the quality of cocoa

829
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:30,679
cor has gotten a lot better over the

830
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:33,599
years um I think some of those

831
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:35,679
inconsistencies have have improved but

832
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:37,839
uh yeah I've never been wanting to use a

833
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:39,720
lot of cocoa core in any of my mixes so

834
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:41,158
it's um it's not something I have as

835
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:45,000
much experience with I've looked into

836
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:47,519
other options and you are seeing more uh

837
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,599
options showing up from like wood pulp

838
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:53,038
the wood pulp industry but I I haven't

839
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:54,719
been able to get the same quality of

840
00:30:53,038 --> 00:30:57,480
growth or production that I can with

841
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:59,200
Pete Moss and until I can get something

842
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:02,038
to to replace it I mean there's

843
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:04,120
somewhere you could potentially reduce

844
00:31:02,038 --> 00:31:06,398
the amount of Pete Moss they can replace

845
00:31:04,119 --> 00:31:09,479
say like 20 to 30% of the Pete in your

846
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:11,199
mix um but they're not they're not able

847
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:14,159
to fully replace it yet but I hope we

848
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:16,319
get there with with a you know new

849
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:18,200
substrates yeah I would say I mean we're

850
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:20,158
getting off topic here but Brian Jackson

851
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:23,080
from MC State I mean he is spearheading

852
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:25,080
the research for um I would say um

853
00:31:23,079 --> 00:31:26,918
uncommon amendments I don't know if it's

854
00:31:25,079 --> 00:31:29,038
specifically I've got a good very good

855
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:30,240
relationship with Brian um but I don't

856
00:31:29,038 --> 00:31:31,839
know if he's specifically looking at

857
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,000
cannabis but he is if anyone's

858
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:36,278
interested in Wood fiber or anything

859
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,480
that's non-traditional Pete um

860
00:31:36,278 --> 00:31:40,558
amendments or or Soul Media or soless

861
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,240
media products definitely it's worth

862
00:31:40,558 --> 00:31:44,119
giving him a

863
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,638
research yeah I'll have to hit you up

864
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:47,158
for an introduction later after the

865
00:31:45,638 --> 00:31:49,839
podcast yeah absolutely I'm sure you'd

866
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:53,159
love to him he's a great guy that'd be

867
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:56,480
great um very cool

868
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:58,960
well then what

869
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:01,599
um I guess I I want to dive a little bit

870
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:04,600
into what sort of products do you

871
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:06,839
find uh you tend to recommend the most

872
00:32:04,599 --> 00:32:09,879
for folks that are that are interested

873
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:11,480
in in utilizing you know products in I

874
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:13,600
realize this that's not for everyone we

875
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:14,919
kind of talked about some of the more

876
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:16,918
General things but what if we got a

877
00:32:14,919 --> 00:32:18,799
little more specific into some of the

878
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:21,679
things that you tend to generally

879
00:32:18,798 --> 00:32:23,879
recommend more frequently than

880
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:25,919
others um we're talking about from an

881
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:27,639
IPM standpoint or or nutritional

882
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:29,360
standpoint I mean we could we can do

883
00:32:27,638 --> 00:32:30,959
either really uh why don't we start with

884
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:35,439
IPM because we've kind of been talking

885
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:37,960
about talking about IPM sure um well it

886
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:40,240
once again depends on the state so a

887
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:42,880
couple of examples of really good States

888
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:45,960
um that are doing an active job of

889
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:47,720
updating lists and providing publicly a

890
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:49,440
publicly available list of active

891
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:51,440
ingredients or specific products that

892
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:54,159
are approved would be like New York uh

893
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:56,159
Colorado Oregon those are kind of the in

894
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:58,399
my mind they're the role model for I

895
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:00,519
would hope Most states eventually move

896
00:32:58,398 --> 00:33:02,278
to actually publishing lists and

897
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:05,200
updating them of products that can be

898
00:33:02,278 --> 00:33:07,079
used a lot of the time it's it is a wild

899
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,919
goose chase I mean we we're trying to

900
00:33:07,079 --> 00:33:11,000
we'd have to sometimes call in to state

901
00:33:08,919 --> 00:33:13,200
government or Regulatory Agencies and

902
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,558
it's really hard for them to want to

903
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,399
give us an answer because frankly maybe

904
00:33:14,558 --> 00:33:18,319
they don't know or the law hasn't been

905
00:33:16,398 --> 00:33:19,638
been written enough with guidance to for

906
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:21,839
them to be able to to give us a

907
00:33:19,638 --> 00:33:24,240
recommendation so and I I hate that I

908
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:25,439
hate that that sometimes we can't the

909
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,480
government's not helping us to help

910
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,759
Growers and sometimes the Growers have a

911
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:30,839
have a problem they don't know what

912
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:34,240
solutions they can legally use so that's

913
00:33:30,839 --> 00:33:35,759
never a good situation but that aside um

914
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,919
the mo the most of the products that I

915
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:40,079
see that are on these sort of approved

916
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:42,880
State lists are going to be your Bavaria

917
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:45,678
bassiana products your iseria fosa

918
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:49,480
products um all your billus products so

919
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:51,080
B basilla subtilus pumilus am Fashions

920
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:53,200
I'm using all these scientific names but

921
00:33:51,079 --> 00:33:55,879
these are the kind of the main staple

922
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:58,080
active ingredients that are utilized by

923
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:59,960
cannabis Growers and when we take kind

924
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:02,720
of microbials out of the equation then

925
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:05,759
we have oils and soaps those play an

926
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:07,200
incredibly incredibly powerful tool um

927
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:09,480
mbgs aren't really a major issue in

928
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,240
cannabis hardly ever seen them but soaps

929
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:13,760
play a major role for for mbgs and then

930
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:15,239
for oils those play a major role for

931
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,280
pretty much all of our insects Under the

932
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:19,918
Sun and all of our Midas sdes I mean

933
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:21,960
there really is no good MDES out there

934
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:24,279
other than oils and so that's that's

935
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:27,240
going to be a staple in every Grower's

936
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:28,519
operation um taking all those microbials

937
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:30,678
out of the situ situation we still have

938
00:34:28,519 --> 00:34:33,440
oxidizers and this is more on a disease

939
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:36,200
prevention standpoint but your sanates

940
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:38,280
zerls any your hydren peroxide parasitic

941
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:40,638
acid products those are incredibly

942
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:43,000
valuable both from a biofilm and algae

943
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:44,599
prevention standpoint we got to remember

944
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,239
wherever there's water and fertilizer

945
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:47,240
there's going to be algae and biofilm

946
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:48,918
and that I don't care if you're an

947
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:51,918
indoor operation or outdoor operation

948
00:34:48,918 --> 00:34:53,638
that's going to be a problem and it does

949
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:55,759
it becomes a literally a physical and

950
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:58,760
Equipment problem for anyone using

951
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:00,680
drippers or hoses or piping ET so

952
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:03,480
injecting continuously or periodically

953
00:35:00,679 --> 00:35:05,440
injecting our sanates of the or sanidate

954
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:07,480
or zerol or hydrogen peroxide parastic

955
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,280
acid products it's a good way to prevent

956
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:11,320
that algae and bile from coming in but

957
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:14,079
also they're incredibly versatile

958
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:16,440
Fungicide and bactericidal property so

959
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:18,880
um I do see some Growers solely relying

960
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:21,320
on something like zerol or sanate or

961
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:24,640
sanate 12.0 because sanidate 5.0 isn't

962
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:26,680
La for plant uh plant contact but zerol

963
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:29,199
for example very broad label see that

964
00:35:26,679 --> 00:35:30,799
used a lot both in fogging applications

965
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:33,480
foler applications and drenching

966
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:36,800
applications as their sole sort of

967
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:36,800
product for um disease

968
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:44,160
prevention and

969
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:46,800
uh with the with the fogging and things

970
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:49,519
like that are you seeing any

971
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:52,119
phytotoxicity with those types of

972
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:54,639
products so actually zerol is fairly

973
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:56,838
safe it's amazing I mean it it's um I'm

974
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:59,078
not going to drop any names but um do

975
00:35:56,838 --> 00:36:00,838
know some very reliable Growers um who

976
00:35:59,079 --> 00:36:02,599
have Tri done some internal trials with

977
00:36:00,838 --> 00:36:04,480
zerotol and I mean they're spraying it

978
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:06,359
all the way to harvest and not having a

979
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:08,800
degradation on on THC levels or

980
00:36:06,358 --> 00:36:10,400
cannaboid levels um would be curious how

981
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,280
it I would like to see some controlled

982
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,720
studies though because it is an oxidizer

983
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:16,800
it does have to have some chemical

984
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:17,838
impact on tpin um and canid content but

985
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,560
I would just love to see where that

986
00:36:17,838 --> 00:36:22,358
threshold is and what it actually does

987
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:25,838
um but as far as phto is concerned I

988
00:36:22,358 --> 00:36:27,960
mean it it's all about rates so it's

989
00:36:25,838 --> 00:36:30,480
important that you read the label and do

990
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:33,440
I I always try to preach this but doing

991
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:35,280
small scale Tri small scale trials can

992
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,800
save you a lot of money and

993
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,800
unfortunately Growers don't do that they

994
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,200
don't just mix up you know one gallon

995
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,160
here and there spray a few plants see

996
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:44,078
what happens but I do encourage Growers

997
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:46,960
to do that especially as they're just

998
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:49,039
establishing rates that work for them um

999
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,599
but in general zerol can be fairly safe

1000
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:52,119
if the rates are or the rates are

1001
00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:54,039
correct and the application process

1002
00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:57,000
correct I mean I mentioned fogging you

1003
00:36:54,039 --> 00:36:59,318
brought up fogging fogging or ulv ultra

1004
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,760
low volume equipment or applicators it's

1005
00:36:59,318 --> 00:37:03,480
becoming very very popular it's been

1006
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,359
it's been I mean drram is I'm not going

1007
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:06,679
to lie dram is spearheaded this um

1008
00:37:05,358 --> 00:37:09,318
they've got the best quality Foggers on

1009
00:37:06,679 --> 00:37:11,598
the market and they are doing the the

1010
00:37:09,318 --> 00:37:13,880
due diligence to understand how to

1011
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:15,880
actually apply it in a safe way um and

1012
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:17,519
I'm seeing a lot of indoor Growers use

1013
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:19,720
like an autof fogger or mini autof

1014
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:21,239
fogger by dram I mean I don't know a

1015
00:37:19,719 --> 00:37:23,118
grower who's invested in one and not

1016
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:24,919
liked it it's just great because you

1017
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:26,960
basically mix it up set the timer set it

1018
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:29,200
in the room and you're you're good to go

1019
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:31,720
it reduces es quite a bit from that

1020
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:33,199
employee safety standpoint that that

1021
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:35,199
hits home there but also it's just not

1022
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:38,439
labor intensive uh it's nowhere near

1023
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:40,039
labor intensive as getting on PPE and

1024
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:41,760
getting a backpack sprayer on and

1025
00:37:40,039 --> 00:37:43,838
spraying plants in the evening no one

1026
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,880
really wants to do that so you all the

1027
00:37:43,838 --> 00:37:48,318
technology is I think it's we're just

1028
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:49,079
kind of in the the the beginning stages

1029
00:37:48,318 --> 00:37:52,519
of

1030
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:53,960
it um but I think it can be very good in

1031
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:56,039
a lot of different situations it

1032
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:59,000
typically tends to reduce the chances of

1033
00:37:56,039 --> 00:38:01,519
phyto because we're using less chemical

1034
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,000
per square footage and the particle size

1035
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:06,318
itself is much smaller so we're not

1036
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:08,079
getting when I look phyto for example um

1037
00:38:06,318 --> 00:38:09,639
what oftentimes happens is you have a

1038
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:11,519
Congregation of liquid or active

1039
00:38:09,639 --> 00:38:12,960
ingredient on the edges of the leaf

1040
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:15,159
because it's all kind of just dripping

1041
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,720
down into that area accumulating and

1042
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:18,440
that's where the phyto damage can occur

1043
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:20,919
but when you fog something it's

1044
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:22,720
uniformly getting those particles at AI

1045
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:25,039
across the entire Leaf surface and we

1046
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:26,919
don't have that puddling effect so that

1047
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:29,440
that in essence does prevent phyto in

1048
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:29,440
that way

1049
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,000
now you have to be careful with what

1050
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:36,799
products like you mentioned a bunch of

1051
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:38,280
microbial Solutions at the beginning um

1052
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:42,960
I'm not aware of any that can go through

1053
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:44,480
a fogger uh just to let folks know and

1054
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,039
maybe I'm wrong here but in my

1055
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:49,119
experience the Foggers pretty much

1056
00:38:46,039 --> 00:38:53,719
destroy all even the basilis species

1057
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:55,400
from what I understand um so luckily

1058
00:38:53,719 --> 00:38:56,919
there are different types of Foggers

1059
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,480
some are thermal-based and some are

1060
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:00,119
basically used using so such high

1061
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,838
pressure and putting it through such a

1062
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:04,119
fine screen that it's kind of creating

1063
00:39:01,838 --> 00:39:06,759
that small particle effect um so many

1064
00:39:04,119 --> 00:39:08,720
autof Foggers for example pulse fog or

1065
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:10,480
biopulse Foggers pulse Foggers are

1066
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:12,439
thermal but there's a biopulse fogger by

1067
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,800
dram that basically I'm not going to go

1068
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:15,838
into but basically allows us put

1069
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:17,599
microbials through it autof Foggers

1070
00:39:15,838 --> 00:39:20,279
they're not they're non-thermal they can

1071
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:23,400
be used they can they can use microbials

1072
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:26,040
in softer chemistry now we put together

1073
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:29,039
um fogging charts for Growers so if you

1074
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:30,679
buy a a dram some sort of fogger through

1075
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:32,079
Griffin we'll put together we put

1076
00:39:30,679 --> 00:39:33,719
together a customized chart for you so

1077
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:35,560
you tell us the square footage of your

1078
00:39:33,719 --> 00:39:37,199
production space and we can tell you

1079
00:39:35,559 --> 00:39:39,880
what products are properly labeled for

1080
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:41,279
fogging and the rates to use them at um

1081
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:43,559
and that's something specific to Griffin

1082
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:47,280
that no other distributor does um but

1083
00:39:43,559 --> 00:39:49,119
that aside um it we can it just depends

1084
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:52,200
on the fogger itself and we can use

1085
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:54,039
microbial some some do get broken down

1086
00:39:52,199 --> 00:39:56,078
oh that's really interesting uh one

1087
00:39:54,039 --> 00:39:57,920
thing I want to touch on with microbials

1088
00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:00,000
um because you mentioned you know a

1089
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:03,800
bunch of different species everything

1090
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:06,480
from Bavaria to iseria basilis things

1091
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:09,039
like that there could be a big

1092
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:13,480
difference I think in quality and

1093
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:16,159
efficacy uh based on not just where you

1094
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:18,280
Source it but also the species itself so

1095
00:40:16,159 --> 00:40:22,118
we can assume that all bavar is the same

1096
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:23,319
all basilis subtilus is the same um and

1097
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:25,079
I think that needs to be taken into

1098
00:40:23,318 --> 00:40:27,960
account I mean just looking at just

1099
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:31,680
taking bavaria's an example I know like

1100
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:35,440
um the bioer product for example has a

1101
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:38,719
very specific uh range of you know

1102
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:40,079
humidity and and heat and cold

1103
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:43,318
temperatures drought conditions that

1104
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:44,800
they can handle and thrive in and then

1105
00:40:43,318 --> 00:40:46,279
you could look at a different you know a

1106
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,560
different Bavaria product and say okay

1107
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:50,440
well maybe because it's a different

1108
00:40:47,559 --> 00:40:54,199
species it may do slightly better or

1109
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:56,519
worse in you know a given environment

1110
00:40:54,199 --> 00:40:58,598
so I think as we're trying out different

1111
00:40:56,519 --> 00:41:00,800
ones kind of be looking at sport camp

1112
00:40:58,599 --> 00:41:03,200
and not taking it to be you know the the

1113
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:05,079
Bible because what says on the label is

1114
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:07,159
not always what's in the package but it

1115
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:09,480
get least give you an idea of whether or

1116
00:41:07,159 --> 00:41:13,039
not this could be a viable

1117
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:15,880
product I 100% agree with you I mean for

1118
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:17,759
me I'm not I'm I'm not a sale I don't

1119
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:19,880
work in sales at all I only just try to

1120
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:22,359
provide Solutions and try to be unbiased

1121
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:25,079
as possible um just given the situation

1122
00:41:22,358 --> 00:41:27,440
so often times a grow will ask us okay

1123
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:28,839
well we see you you know we see there's

1124
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,599
a lot of different Bavaria products or

1125
00:41:28,838 --> 00:41:33,239
Aid duratin products out there whatever

1126
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:35,559
it may be um which one should I go with

1127
00:41:33,239 --> 00:41:37,199
and well I go okay well how much is

1128
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:39,039
let's look at Cost that's always a good

1129
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:41,519
parameter to look at so we like to do

1130
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:44,239
cost and use analyses so what's the cost

1131
00:41:41,519 --> 00:41:46,639
per gallon or cost per pound of AI or

1132
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:48,118
whatever it may be um that's something

1133
00:41:46,639 --> 00:41:50,039
that's a very quick calculation we do

1134
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:52,160
all the time just to get a grow just to

1135
00:41:50,039 --> 00:41:54,480
let the grower understand okay well this

1136
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:56,679
is more in my budget range um and I'm

1137
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:58,280
willing to maybe jeopardize some maybe

1138
00:41:56,679 --> 00:42:00,039
level of quality quality to make sure

1139
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:03,640
that I still applying the right amount

1140
00:42:00,039 --> 00:42:06,358
of active ingredient given my price

1141
00:42:03,639 --> 00:42:07,838
range yeah that's a good point and I

1142
00:42:06,358 --> 00:42:11,039
think about like what do I want to have

1143
00:42:07,838 --> 00:42:12,199
in my pantry as a grower this is

1144
00:42:11,039 --> 00:42:16,679
something I've been thinking more and

1145
00:42:12,199 --> 00:42:18,318
more about lately what sorts of tools uh

1146
00:42:16,679 --> 00:42:21,799
let's say let's say with IPM would you

1147
00:42:18,318 --> 00:42:21,800
want to keep in your in your

1148
00:42:22,318 --> 00:42:27,679
pantry uh well I would say definitely an

1149
00:42:25,039 --> 00:42:32,039
oil um with what's available i' I'd have

1150
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:33,440
a basilis um for a as my fungicide I'd

1151
00:42:32,039 --> 00:42:36,079
have also trichoderma so like root

1152
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:38,679
shield for example very common sort of

1153
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:40,519
inoculant um for and when we talk about

1154
00:42:38,679 --> 00:42:43,318
all these microbials they should they

1155
00:42:40,519 --> 00:42:45,079
should really be used preventatively um

1156
00:42:43,318 --> 00:42:47,199
I mean it's like BCA biological control

1157
00:42:45,079 --> 00:42:49,280
agents we should go into this with the

1158
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:50,799
mentality and perspective of this is

1159
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:52,880
going to be I'm putting this out to

1160
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:54,960
prevent anything that that

1161
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,680
develops these software chemistries

1162
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,880
they're just not really meant to be a

1163
00:42:56,679 --> 00:43:00,239
come from behind product or a knockdown

1164
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:02,200
product some of them do have some of

1165
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:04,078
those characteristics but it's always

1166
00:43:02,199 --> 00:43:06,480
better to be using these preventatively

1167
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:08,960
um proactive proactively rather than

1168
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:10,079
reactively um but I think we've named

1169
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,760
some of the major ones I would

1170
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:15,640
definitely have um there's a lot of

1171
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:17,880
conventional chemistries U that I wish

1172
00:43:15,639 --> 00:43:19,279
would be accepted in cannabis use just

1173
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:21,800
because they would I think be a

1174
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:24,079
GameChanger especially on the fungicidal

1175
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:26,359
standpoint I think with insecticides

1176
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:27,880
there there really isn't there's there's

1177
00:43:26,358 --> 00:43:29,318
very there's a fine line between hard

1178
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:31,400
chemistry and soft chemistry but when we

1179
00:43:29,318 --> 00:43:33,599
move to fungicides there's definitely

1180
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:35,318
some that are in that kind of gray area

1181
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:37,519
that are are currently used or labeled

1182
00:43:35,318 --> 00:43:39,119
for edible use that I could easily see

1183
00:43:37,519 --> 00:43:42,480
um be used in cannabis

1184
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:45,160
use H yeah so you you mentioned you'd

1185
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:48,119
want an oil

1186
00:43:45,159 --> 00:43:52,838
um like for for example for anab basilla

1187
00:43:48,119 --> 00:43:54,559
so like for me um I I would put uh an

1188
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:58,039
oil a Horticultural some sort of

1189
00:43:54,559 --> 00:44:00,559
horticultural oil like you mentioned um

1190
00:43:58,039 --> 00:44:04,119
I really like Bavaria I really like

1191
00:44:00,559 --> 00:44:08,280
traderma um I haven't used a lot of

1192
00:44:04,119 --> 00:44:12,480
basilis species from a from a pesticide

1193
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:14,800
or uh prevention aspect I've only used

1194
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:16,519
them for like nutrient cycling and and

1195
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:19,760
those sorts of like benefits so that's

1196
00:44:16,519 --> 00:44:21,719
interesting that you mentioned that um I

1197
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:23,920
will say yes there are kind of you'll

1198
00:44:21,719 --> 00:44:26,399
see these sort of um soil and they it's

1199
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:28,800
labeling is very is an interesting art I

1200
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:30,318
will say um but there are certain things

1201
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:32,240
that are labeled as soil amendments or

1202
00:44:30,318 --> 00:44:34,318
soil inoculant that will have variety of

1203
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:38,519
different vasilla species that you will

1204
00:44:34,318 --> 00:44:39,759
see do have um they do have pesticidal

1205
00:44:38,519 --> 00:44:41,159
properties if you look in other

1206
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:44,280
fungicides that have those active

1207
00:44:41,159 --> 00:44:46,039
ingredients the the the producer of that

1208
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:47,920
product just cannot legally make those

1209
00:44:46,039 --> 00:44:51,679
claims or they'd have to change the

1210
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:53,400
labeling itself um sure but I will say

1211
00:44:51,679 --> 00:44:55,239
with Bavaria and this is actually with

1212
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:57,559
oils too A lot of these microbs can be

1213
00:44:55,239 --> 00:44:59,639
tank mixed and there's s there's symbiot

1214
00:44:57,559 --> 00:45:01,200
like symbiotic relationships I'll say

1215
00:44:59,639 --> 00:45:03,759
synergistic relationships with each

1216
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:05,919
other so Bavaria tank mixed with aid

1217
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:08,400
duratin aid duratin is an extract from

1218
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:10,280
neem oil and it's an igr and insect

1219
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,800
growth regulator pairing these are

1220
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:14,000
really ites a very powerful and

1221
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:16,359
broadspectrum application the reason why

1222
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,639
is that most of these microbials either

1223
00:45:16,358 --> 00:45:20,480
they either bavar either fungal or

1224
00:45:18,639 --> 00:45:22,558
bacterial based is that we're trying to

1225
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:23,519
ultimately coat the insect or MIT or

1226
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:25,480
whatever we're trying to go after we're

1227
00:45:23,519 --> 00:45:27,280
trying to coat them and get as much of

1228
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:29,280
that active ingredient on them as

1229
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:30,480
possible because what happens is that

1230
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,480
it's fungal based it's going to

1231
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:34,760
ultimately sporulate inside that insect

1232
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:36,599
and kill it if it's B if it's bacterial

1233
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:39,559
based typically what happens is they

1234
00:45:36,599 --> 00:45:41,359
actually um if if they get wet then it

1235
00:45:39,559 --> 00:45:43,440
can dissolve in and dissolve in through

1236
00:45:41,358 --> 00:45:45,960
a membrane like that but also what I

1237
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:47,960
like about bacterium or bacteria based

1238
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:49,720
pesticides is that when they eat the pro

1239
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:51,079
they eat the foliage that has the

1240
00:45:49,719 --> 00:45:52,959
bacterium in it they're ingesting it

1241
00:45:51,079 --> 00:45:55,800
that way but either way if I pair it

1242
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:57,599
with an ACD duratin an igr insect growth

1243
00:45:55,800 --> 00:46:00,200
regulator it keeps that Spore on there

1244
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:01,559
for longer like aphids for I mean any of

1245
00:46:00,199 --> 00:46:03,239
our major insects they're going through

1246
00:46:01,559 --> 00:46:05,200
molting processes I mean they're

1247
00:46:03,239 --> 00:46:07,879
continuously trying to mol to ultimately

1248
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:09,519
come adults but if we can use an igr to

1249
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:11,559
prevent them from molting they can't

1250
00:46:09,519 --> 00:46:13,318
actually physically shed the spores or

1251
00:46:11,559 --> 00:46:15,240
inoculum we're putting on them and so

1252
00:46:13,318 --> 00:46:16,558
that's why it's a great combination

1253
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:17,959
that's a very common program we

1254
00:46:16,559 --> 00:46:20,720
recommend and typically we're doing that

1255
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:22,639
on a five to seven day interval as far

1256
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:24,480
as read

1257
00:46:22,639 --> 00:46:26,719
application yeah that's really that's

1258
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:27,639
really useful uh one thing that I was

1259
00:46:26,719 --> 00:46:28,959
thinking thinking of while you were

1260
00:46:27,639 --> 00:46:32,279
talking about this that we haven't

1261
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:34,559
mentioned is nematodes um I did a recent

1262
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:37,240
podcast with Julie Gres from bioworks

1263
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:40,480
talking a lot about nematodes and I just

1264
00:46:37,239 --> 00:46:43,959
recently made a recommendation of the SF

1265
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:46,039
or Steiner NE feler mispronounce it uh

1266
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:48,679
nematodes uh specifically as a

1267
00:46:46,039 --> 00:46:50,920
preventative because

1268
00:46:48,679 --> 00:46:53,279
um especially in living soils or when

1269
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:54,880
you have any compost fraction you're or

1270
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,559
any organic matter in general you're

1271
00:46:54,880 --> 00:47:00,119
probably going to at the very least have

1272
00:46:56,559 --> 00:47:02,200
fungus SS um not to mention the numerous

1273
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:04,318
other things that these neod work so

1274
00:47:02,199 --> 00:47:08,799
effectively on they play nicely with

1275
00:47:04,318 --> 00:47:10,279
Bavaria and other microbials um so like

1276
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:12,960
for me that would go in my pantry too

1277
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:14,800
now that we're talking about things that

1278
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:16,920
I just I love to have as a part of a

1279
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:19,480
maintenance IPM

1280
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:20,960
program yeah absolutely and don't get me

1281
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:22,599
started on BCA that' be a whole another

1282
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:24,760
talk I me Julie's Fant Julie is

1283
00:47:22,599 --> 00:47:26,039
fantastic um that's why I love also

1284
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:27,880
about my position I get to interact with

1285
00:47:26,039 --> 00:47:30,279
all these really good professionals and

1286
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:32,358
these different vendors um but like you

1287
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:33,960
said Stein feler and there's other

1288
00:47:32,358 --> 00:47:35,880
different beneficial nematodes out there

1289
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:38,480
depending on what we're after I love NE

1290
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:40,640
beneficial nematodes specifically um SF

1291
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:42,440
specii because it goes after the thrip

1292
00:47:40,639 --> 00:47:44,159
pupa so we don't a lot of people don't

1293
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:45,480
understand this but when thri they

1294
00:47:44,159 --> 00:47:47,358
basically have two laral stages and then

1295
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:48,838
when they want to pupate meaning that

1296
00:47:47,358 --> 00:47:50,318
they want to become an adult they'll

1297
00:47:48,838 --> 00:47:51,920
actually drop to the soul surface and

1298
00:47:50,318 --> 00:47:54,279
it's at that point the nematodes

1299
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:55,880
actually become very beneficial there um

1300
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:58,519
so they play a very key role for both

1301
00:47:55,880 --> 00:48:01,680
fungus net um both both fungus snap even

1302
00:47:58,519 --> 00:48:03,480
Shor flies and um thrip control now this

1303
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:05,919
is a tool it's not chemical but I'm

1304
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:07,199
seeing Growers not enough Growers use it

1305
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:09,039
but I'm starting to see ornamental

1306
00:48:07,199 --> 00:48:12,358
Growers massive ornamental Growers use

1307
00:48:09,039 --> 00:48:15,159
it and it's yellow sticky tape not cards

1308
00:48:12,358 --> 00:48:16,358
so yellow sticky sticky cards everyone's

1309
00:48:15,159 --> 00:48:18,318
probably familiar with that they've seen

1310
00:48:16,358 --> 00:48:21,078
it in an operation on a bench right

1311
00:48:18,318 --> 00:48:23,400
above the canopy and it and they it that

1312
00:48:21,079 --> 00:48:24,960
a yeli card is meant for scouting it's

1313
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:27,280
really meant to see what is present

1314
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:29,599
that's flying around okay but yellow

1315
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:32,599
sticky tape that literally comes in hund

1316
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:34,280
several 100 foot rolls you can wrap that

1317
00:48:32,599 --> 00:48:36,760
between benches and then we have

1318
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:39,200
actually a physical way of reducing the

1319
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:41,119
disease or I'm sorry the insect pressure

1320
00:48:39,199 --> 00:48:42,919
and that works really well I mean it

1321
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:44,160
really really work works well I wish I

1322
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:46,800
could share my screen I'd show you a

1323
00:48:44,159 --> 00:48:48,199
photo of of of a of several operations

1324
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:50,200
using it especially in the Southeast

1325
00:48:48,199 --> 00:48:52,679
where fungus net fungus Nets are just

1326
00:48:50,199 --> 00:48:55,078
out of control they fill every square

1327
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:57,358
inch of that of that sticky tape so

1328
00:48:55,079 --> 00:48:58,680
that's a that's a cool little C tool I

1329
00:48:57,358 --> 00:49:00,159
don't see enough Growers using it

1330
00:48:58,679 --> 00:49:01,598
beneficial inory produces it and they

1331
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:03,519
also produce these clips that are very

1332
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:06,480
helpful to attaching them to structures

1333
00:49:03,519 --> 00:49:06,480
but definitely something to look

1334
00:49:06,599 --> 00:49:11,640
into yeah we work with catchmaster who

1335
00:49:09,039 --> 00:49:14,960
makes a lot of these type of of cards

1336
00:49:11,639 --> 00:49:17,400
and uh I I've seen the roles um in

1337
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:19,440
facilities though actually Mass trapping

1338
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:21,599
kind of what you're describing uh the

1339
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:24,280
one I was in it was it was primarily rud

1340
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:27,160
aphids at the time and they were uh very

1341
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:31,599
prolific and you could see them all over

1342
00:49:27,159 --> 00:49:33,519
the uh all over the tape um in fact oh

1343
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:35,200
that's a big issue then yeah we were

1344
00:49:33,519 --> 00:49:36,880
brushing them off of ourselves our our

1345
00:49:35,199 --> 00:49:39,358
tyac suits as we were walking out of the

1346
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:40,880
room it was uh it was a lot and one

1347
00:49:39,358 --> 00:49:42,798
thing I learned on that one that was

1348
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:45,000
kind of interesting is they they

1349
00:49:42,798 --> 00:49:50,480
couldn't figure out why there were dead

1350
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:52,920
winged adult rude aphids on um on the

1351
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:56,039
buds themselves like on what people call

1352
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:57,798
Sugar leaves you know the and um

1353
00:49:56,039 --> 00:49:59,039
essentially I talked to Suzanne about

1354
00:49:57,798 --> 00:50:00,519
this what she said was happening was

1355
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:03,440
they were actually going up too close to

1356
00:50:00,519 --> 00:50:05,280
the light dying and then falling back

1357
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:07,318
down and Landing there so it wasn't any

1358
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:09,240
sort of IPM practice that they had that

1359
00:50:07,318 --> 00:50:11,159
was killing these which was they they

1360
00:50:09,239 --> 00:50:13,598
had guessed some different bacterias

1361
00:50:11,159 --> 00:50:14,798
possibly or other things um it was

1362
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:16,160
really just the mechanical action of

1363
00:50:14,798 --> 00:50:19,318
flying up into the lights and coming

1364
00:50:16,159 --> 00:50:23,318
back down and Landing but uh yeah yeah

1365
00:50:19,318 --> 00:50:26,880
pretty crazy to see on that scale

1366
00:50:23,318 --> 00:50:28,159
um tough rud AIDS are tough like I mean

1367
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:30,760
it's it was a good facility I'm not

1368
00:50:28,159 --> 00:50:32,318
throwing them under a bus like it it's a

1369
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:33,960
problem that's once you have it it's

1370
00:50:32,318 --> 00:50:37,798
very hard on the commercial scale to get

1371
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:39,519
rid of I absolutely it's uh the best way

1372
00:50:37,798 --> 00:50:42,679
toe the best way to solve it is prevent

1373
00:50:39,519 --> 00:50:45,039
it um rude aits can be a really bad one

1374
00:50:42,679 --> 00:50:46,519
the problem is they don't they they they

1375
00:50:45,039 --> 00:50:48,239
create an economic loss but they don't

1376
00:50:46,519 --> 00:50:50,239
kill the plant typically they're just

1377
00:50:48,239 --> 00:50:52,639
really they never allow your plants to

1378
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:53,759
really reach maximum yield or maximum

1379
00:50:52,639 --> 00:50:56,159
progression because they just they

1380
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:57,960
stress out the roots from day one um

1381
00:50:56,159 --> 00:51:00,279
what I see as far as primary control

1382
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:03,159
mechanisms for that if if allowed would

1383
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:05,000
be a batan guard or a Bavaria product

1384
00:51:03,159 --> 00:51:07,159
that's labeled for drenching tank mix

1385
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,519
with an Aida and that's also labeled for

1386
00:51:07,159 --> 00:51:10,879
drenching and doing a full volume

1387
00:51:08,519 --> 00:51:13,559
substrate drench literally to to almost

1388
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:16,039
leech basically to leech um in some C

1389
00:51:13,559 --> 00:51:18,160
some certain situations in States pyin

1390
00:51:16,039 --> 00:51:21,239
can be used and now and you would never

1391
00:51:18,159 --> 00:51:22,480
catch me recommending a pyoid for Aid

1392
00:51:21,239 --> 00:51:24,159
control on the ornamental side because

1393
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:26,079
there just so much resistance to that

1394
00:51:24,159 --> 00:51:28,000
sort of chemistry but on the ornamental

1395
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:30,798
on the a side of things we haven't used

1396
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:33,358
pyu rins again and again and again on on

1397
00:51:30,798 --> 00:51:35,920
rud Aid so um there are certain states

1398
00:51:33,358 --> 00:51:38,078
that do allow like a pyoid drench and

1399
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:39,639
that there's only a few pyoid products

1400
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:41,680
that I'm aware of that actually have a

1401
00:51:39,639 --> 00:51:43,960
drench label so Panic would be an

1402
00:51:41,679 --> 00:51:45,798
example of one that that is I have seen

1403
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:47,639
that be

1404
00:51:45,798 --> 00:51:50,719
effective yeah I've never really messed

1405
00:51:47,639 --> 00:51:53,759
with pyrin um I will say that I'm

1406
00:51:50,719 --> 00:51:56,118
excited for this granulated uh Bavaria

1407
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:58,599
product from from bioer it's actually

1408
00:51:56,119 --> 00:52:00,358
something using right now in my garden

1409
00:51:58,599 --> 00:52:02,160
uh because it can be mixed into the

1410
00:52:00,358 --> 00:52:05,039
incorporated into the media and then you

1411
00:52:02,159 --> 00:52:07,598
get a slower release of Bavaria and and

1412
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:08,679
the issue with the rud AIDS is I mean

1413
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:11,000
that's a great suggestion with the

1414
00:52:08,679 --> 00:52:12,759
botanigard but I I I don't feel like the

1415
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,719
spores the Bavaria spores are really

1416
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:17,319
making it to the bottom of the container

1417
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:18,358
and it's really those uh holes in the

1418
00:52:17,318 --> 00:52:21,440
bottom of the container where the water

1419
00:52:18,358 --> 00:52:23,159
seeps out that that's the pro it's same

1420
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:24,838
with fungus snats like that's the real

1421
00:52:23,159 --> 00:52:27,199
problem location that there really isn't

1422
00:52:24,838 --> 00:52:29,960
a great solution for I feel like

1423
00:52:27,199 --> 00:52:31,399
um in a lot of cases so I I I think

1424
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:34,880
incorporating to the media might be a

1425
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:37,039
good option for really getting Bavaria

1426
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:38,680
down in throughout the whole container

1427
00:52:37,039 --> 00:52:40,039
to help with the root AIDS but I I don't

1428
00:52:38,679 --> 00:52:42,480
know what are your thoughts on

1429
00:52:40,039 --> 00:52:44,480
that um well with fungus Nets we

1430
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:46,240
typically see them in the top one one to

1431
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:47,519
two inches of soil and so when I'm

1432
00:52:46,239 --> 00:52:49,399
talking to a grower who's new to

1433
00:52:47,519 --> 00:52:51,318
nematodes for example I don't tell them

1434
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:53,160
to drench the entire media because

1435
00:52:51,318 --> 00:52:54,639
really the thri pupa and the fungus not

1436
00:52:53,159 --> 00:52:57,118
they're in that just top layer of soil

1437
00:52:54,639 --> 00:52:58,480
so it's just more of like just a quick

1438
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:00,640
quick watering I don't want them to

1439
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:02,480
waste chemical or product um but when it

1440
00:53:00,639 --> 00:53:04,039
comes to rids like you said they do

1441
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:05,719
easily easily and that's how they

1442
00:53:04,039 --> 00:53:07,279
they'll use as a transport is when

1443
00:53:05,719 --> 00:53:08,959
someone's a heavy waterer or they're

1444
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:10,760
leeching or whatever it may be they'll

1445
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:12,798
flush out the bottom of container

1446
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:15,400
between of the holes and then they'll

1447
00:53:12,798 --> 00:53:17,159
just work their way to another pot what

1448
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:18,639
I do see some Growers and this I don't

1449
00:53:17,159 --> 00:53:21,838
want to harp on pyrethroids because it's

1450
00:53:18,639 --> 00:53:24,078
not very commonly used in in cannabis or

1451
00:53:21,838 --> 00:53:25,880
accepted in cannabis um but what grows

1452
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:27,720
will do is they'll they'll for they'll

1453
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:31,000
physically do that they'll they'll Lee

1454
00:53:27,719 --> 00:53:32,759
their pots to force the aid to want to

1455
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,639
leave the exit holes and then they will

1456
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:36,079
spray between the pots and this is

1457
00:53:34,639 --> 00:53:38,159
really I don't think this makes sense

1458
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:41,318
for a large scale but for a smaller

1459
00:53:38,159 --> 00:53:44,159
operation I I can see that making sense

1460
00:53:41,318 --> 00:53:48,519
somewhat I never heard of that that's

1461
00:53:44,159 --> 00:53:49,598
interesting yeah well um I feel like

1462
00:53:48,519 --> 00:53:51,199
we've been talking for a little while

1463
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:54,838

you know we try to learn from you as

1473
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:16,240
well I what I I've talked about all the

1474
00:54:14,798 --> 00:54:17,838
great things in my position and the

1475
00:54:16,239 --> 00:54:21,000
people I work with but I also get to

1476
00:54:17,838 --> 00:54:23,759
work with every different type of grower

1477
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:25,960
um I'm I try to be an educator at heart

1478
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:27,760
but honestly we continue learning

1479
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:30,079
because the things we learn from Growers

1480
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:32,119
so um if you just want even want to call

1481
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:33,280
and pick our brain we're GNA just be

1482
00:54:32,119 --> 00:54:34,960
prepared because we're going to ask you

1483
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:36,240
questions so we try to understand what

1484
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:38,559
you're doing and what's working and

1485
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:39,598
what's not so um please feel free to

1486
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:41,839
reach

1487
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:45,160
out yeah I love that that's really good

1488
00:54:41,838 --> 00:54:48,159
to know as a resource for for Growers

1489
00:54:45,159 --> 00:54:50,558
and just to kind of piggyback on that I

1490
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:52,519
find that when people reach out to me

1491
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:55,400
like a lot of times I I may not have the

1492
00:54:52,519 --> 00:54:57,679
answer but um just having that Network

1493
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:59,480
within both cannabis and horiculture and

1494
00:54:57,679 --> 00:55:01,838
be able to reach out to people at these

1495
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:03,639
other companies or universities you know

1496
00:55:01,838 --> 00:55:06,400
your network is is obviously very

1497
00:55:03,639 --> 00:55:09,440
valuable uh to be able to find an answer

1498
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:11,160
is is really the the best thing because

1499
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:13,400
then we everyone

1500
00:55:11,159 --> 00:55:15,279
learns yeah there's a lot there's a lot

1501
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:17,559
of people smarter than me out there and

1502
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:20,160
