00:00:21,868 --> 00:00:26,070
this is the podcast where we discuss the

6
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,320
cutting edge of organic growing from a

7
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:30,000
science-based perspective and drawn top

experts from around the industry to

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,670
share their wisdom and knowledge our

border collie Lucy and when he can find

38
00:01:33,328 --> 00:01:38,969
few greater joys than sailing on the

39
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:40,799
mighty Columbia River I caught back up

40
00:01:38,969 --> 00:01:42,899
with Jeremy this week and got to ask him

41
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:47,100
many of your questions as well as a few

42
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:48,629
of my own here's the interview all right

43
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:50,569
hey Jeremy thanks for coming back on the

44
00:01:48,629 --> 00:01:53,219
show I really appreciate it

45
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:55,258
hey the pleasure pad really excited to

46
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:57,090
be back with you all right well let's

47
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:59,489
just dive right in with questions cuz

48
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:01,920
I've gotten a bunch over the past the

49
00:01:59,489 --> 00:02:04,078
past week and a half and I had a few of

50
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,810
my own I'm just gonna go ahead and take

51
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:08,639
the ones from from guests first

52
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,729
this one was left on the youtube channel

53
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,079
from a Kay Frost and he said I'm curious

54
00:02:11,729 --> 00:02:14,789
about the different red speck

55
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,480
terms effects on the plants production

56
00:02:14,789 --> 00:02:20,489
quality and cannabinoids also what were

57
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:22,739
his findings as far as best target P

58
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:27,540
PFDs for different stages of the plant's

59
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:29,040
life or age okay actually if you could

60
00:02:27,539 --> 00:02:30,780
repeat the second question I actually

61
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:33,539
didn't hear that clearly I got the first

62
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:36,360
part so if you want to address the first

63
00:02:33,539 --> 00:02:38,099
one he's asking about Gooden spectrum

64
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:42,300
effects on plant production quality and

65
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:45,120
cannabinoid production so in terms of

66
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:47,880
morphology or production quality we know

67
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:51,180
that red light has this effect on plants

68
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:52,859
that is either shade avoidance or shade

69
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:56,000
tolerant in terms of how the plant

70
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:58,380
responds cannabis has this remarkable

71
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,639
evolutionary heritage of clearly being

72
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:04,379
shade avoidant which if you read you can

73
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:07,250
excuse me knots tumor so if you read Rob

74
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:09,209
Clark's evolution and ethnobotany

75
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:12,180
treatise that he wrote with George

76
00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:14,430
Merlyn one of the early theories he had

77
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:16,170
is that when hunter-gatherers were

78
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:18,450
bringing seeds back to where human

79
00:03:16,169 --> 00:03:20,759
settlements were and the seeds were sort

80
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:22,409
of both being consumed and also cast by

81
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:24,870
the area where they were inhabiting

82
00:03:22,409 --> 00:03:27,840
these plants while they're growing under

83
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:30,209
a forest canopy chopping up most of the

84
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,219
near red light were quite responsive to

85
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:34,289
the far red light still passing through

86
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:37,769
the canopy thus creating these really

87
00:03:34,289 --> 00:03:40,469
long plants reaching up to capture the

88
00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:43,439
light again so really you see this shade

89
00:03:40,469 --> 00:03:45,539
avoidant behavior but that has some

90
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:46,919
unfavorable implications for production

91
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:48,870
and the last one I talked about some of

92
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:51,389
the favorable outcomes the unfavorable

93
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:54,480
outcome is in general we're trying to

94
00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:57,149
reduce lanky cultivars and create more

95
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:59,159
compact consistent growth so there's

96
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:02,310
some balance there if you're seeing some

97
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:04,650
elongated internodal spacing but that's

98
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:07,550
that's the first part Oh in terms of

99
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:09,719
phytochemistry we're seeing nominal

100
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:11,850
effects that actually have not been

101
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:14,729
fully quantified even though we're about

102
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:17,790
a year deep into this only this last

103
00:04:14,729 --> 00:04:20,579
three month is really mature enough to

104
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:23,840
be able to clearly tell that story and

105
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:26,250
so I actually can't say with any kind of

106
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:27,029
definitive answer what the difference is

107
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:30,000
yet

108
00:04:27,029 --> 00:04:31,349
but there is a difference for sure I in

109
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,199
a future podcast that could definitely

110
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:35,939
speak to that okay and then he was

111
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:38,668
asking what your findings were as far as

112
00:04:35,939 --> 00:04:44,219
best target ppfd levels for different

113
00:04:38,668 --> 00:04:46,319
stages of plant plant growth ah so this

114
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:48,030
is a complicated theme they'll try to be

115
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:51,180
succinct and responding to which is that

116
00:04:48,029 --> 00:04:53,699
the ppfd targets for different

117
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:57,540
developmental stages varies greatly both

118
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:58,918
by cultivar and which sort of region

119
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:02,340
you're bringing those cultivars from

120
00:04:58,918 --> 00:05:04,199
clearly highlight regions affect the

121
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:07,139
evolution of the plant to be receptive

122
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:09,418
to heightened ppfd targets and one

123
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:13,079
example just the most simple levels that

124
00:05:09,418 --> 00:05:15,089
a narrow blade morphology clearly had

125
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:18,779
something like an abundance of solar

126
00:05:15,089 --> 00:05:20,399
radiation a broad blade morphology was

127
00:05:18,779 --> 00:05:23,429
probably trying to more efficiently

128
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:25,918
capture that solar radiation and so that

129
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:28,740
kind of can tell you in a spectrum

130
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:31,289
between narrow and broadleaf if the

131
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:34,199
plant was likely to be able to receive

132
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:39,330
higher or lower amounts of light and an

133
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:42,300
optimal setting but in terms of ppfd

134
00:05:39,329 --> 00:05:44,310
targets that we use I was at photo X

135
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,650
conference with you recently and I met a

136
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:49,649
man from group O floor who's running

137
00:05:46,649 --> 00:05:52,978
really mega high intense targets in the

138
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:54,719
early veg clearly if you get high light

139
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:56,879
and early veg and the plants can

140
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,760
tolerate it without causing harm you

141
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:02,519
find that you actually get to this you

142
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,949
know super metabolic plant that is got

143
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:06,478
incredibly thick stalk and is going to

144
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:09,779
have more biomass creation more

145
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:12,478
phytochemical yield i've not found that

146
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:15,000
plants can tolerate near to the levels

147
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:16,529
that he was describing but without going

148
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,199
too far down the worm hole something

149
00:06:16,529 --> 00:06:21,179
like you know in propagation with

150
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:24,180
dimmable LEDs one of the huge advantages

151
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:26,970
is that you can graduate the light from

152
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:29,370
a very low amount in that first couple

153
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:31,140
of days while routing is not begun and

154
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:34,410
you're really adjusting to this kind of

155
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:38,759
new environment and then graduate maybe

156
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:40,620
around 150 to 250 you moles production

157
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:43,920
goes into a vegetative environment

158
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:46,379
in the vicinity of 400 you moles in

159
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:48,330
Blooming environments we're seeing with

160
00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:52,050
people that are running double-ended HPS

161
00:06:48,329 --> 00:06:54,539
somewhere near 800 to 900 you moles one

162
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:57,780
example of like are led implementation

163
00:06:54,540 --> 00:07:00,810
is that we're getting closer to 1400 you

164
00:06:57,779 --> 00:07:03,479
moles the gradations and the different

165
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:05,910
sort of developmental stages for

166
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:07,800
different cultivars vary widely and it's

167
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:10,320
really important to not try to approach

168
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,120
a one-size-fits-all solution and to

169
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,519
really find what your plants and your

170
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:17,430
particular environment and where the

171
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:19,379
best plant health is I just want to add

172
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:21,329
to this and and correct me if I say

173
00:07:19,379 --> 00:07:24,240
anything wrong here I remember at photo

174
00:07:21,329 --> 00:07:26,609
X there was some research presented some

175
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,439
of it I believe from dr. Allison justice

176
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:31,080
who's coming on the podcast soon I'm

177
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:33,899
very excited she she did some research

178
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:36,149
looking at different target ppfd levels

179
00:07:33,899 --> 00:07:39,449
from an efficiency perspective in terms

180
00:07:36,149 --> 00:07:40,919
of yield and the cost of that lighting

181
00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:43,889
from I believe that she was using

182
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:46,680
wattage over time at eight hundred a

183
00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:48,509
thousand and then 1200 and and in that

184
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:51,150
facility using the cultivars they found

185
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:55,370
that one thousand was that sort of sweet

186
00:07:51,149 --> 00:07:57,719
spot for yield and light efficiency but

187
00:07:55,370 --> 00:08:00,780
there was another one presented where

188
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:03,180
they went up to I believe 1500 looking

189
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:05,879
at 1500 you moles looking at it and

190
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:08,160
found that cannabis could tolerate this

191
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:10,379
particular cultivar could tolerate those

192
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:15,600
high light levels they didn't they

193
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:17,579
hadn't found that upward limit but again

194
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:19,830
at that point I think the issue is more

195
00:08:17,579 --> 00:08:22,560
light efficiency in terms of what your

196
00:08:19,829 --> 00:08:25,199
yield is sort of on a curb bell curve as

197
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:28,079
it was explained to me and so at some

198
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,930
point where we're maximizing our yield

199
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:32,669
if we go beyond that point we may get a

200
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:33,870
little bit more yield but the the amount

201
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:36,059
of light that we're going to use to do

202
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:39,810
that it makes it less and less efficient

203
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:42,239
is that correct yes that is correct

204
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:44,189
and really this becomes a consideration

205
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,009
for especially commercial cannabis

206
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:50,060
producers you know operation expenses

207
00:08:47,009 --> 00:08:52,919
must be reduced to over the overall

208
00:08:50,059 --> 00:08:54,309
costs and inputs to create a margin and

209
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:55,990
so forth but

210
00:08:54,309 --> 00:08:58,208
there is actually a paper along these

211
00:08:55,990 --> 00:09:00,278
same lines that I haven't read in a few

212
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:02,138
years that was the only paper I ever saw

213
00:09:00,278 --> 00:09:04,838
published I believe from University of

214
00:09:02,139 --> 00:09:07,360
Mississippi that had essentially an

215
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:10,540
efficiency study where light intensity

216
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:12,970
co2 level and temperature were

217
00:09:10,539 --> 00:09:14,948
correlated and they showed some sort of

218
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:17,589
gradations that Illustrated if you were

219
00:09:14,948 --> 00:09:20,198
going beyond around a thousand you mole

220
00:09:17,589 --> 00:09:22,209
you were seeing like very nominal gains

221
00:09:20,198 --> 00:09:25,719
and biomass creations there wasn't

222
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:28,659
phytochemical data correlated with that

223
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:30,220
study so I that study had a variety of

224
00:09:28,659 --> 00:09:32,740
issues and was kind of the first of its

225
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:34,839
kind but I would say that Allison's work

226
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:36,100
is more contemporary and you know

227
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:38,079
they're really working with more

228
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:40,420
contemporary production technology and

229
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:42,609
better cannabis scheme of ours and and

230
00:09:40,419 --> 00:09:44,438
so it's more interesting insight there

231
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:46,720
but but one thing I'll say is that

232
00:09:44,438 --> 00:09:48,188
production variables you know for

233
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,500
operational efficiency aren't

234
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:52,328
necessarily the most important targets

235
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:54,009
for all of us especially if you're

236
00:09:52,328 --> 00:09:57,758
seeking to produce you know really

237
00:09:54,009 --> 00:09:59,800
monumental kimo types and really diverse

238
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:04,240
ones it turns out like really cannabis

239
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:05,948
can tolerate a lot of light I think that

240
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:09,188
one of the things my friend Bob Hoffman

241
00:10:05,948 --> 00:10:11,318
who's a frequent participant of photo X

242
00:10:09,188 --> 00:10:15,490
says is that we've actually made a lot

243
00:10:11,318 --> 00:10:17,969
of co2 junky plants and that we use

244
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:20,649
probably more co2 than is needed and

245
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:23,500
there's actually a negative side effect

246
00:10:20,649 --> 00:10:25,360
where you actually have a reduced amount

247
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:27,759
of Stowe model development

248
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:30,430
so the Stowe mates are getting this

249
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:32,860
message in the morphological development

250
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:34,929
that they're essentially not needed in

251
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:38,139
it such an abundance and so you create

252
00:10:34,929 --> 00:10:40,299
plants that really need to have these

253
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:41,409
very very high co2 environments of

254
00:10:40,299 --> 00:10:43,778
course when we're looking at light

255
00:10:41,409 --> 00:10:45,958
intensity you have to speak to the

256
00:10:43,778 --> 00:10:49,929
relationship between light and gas and

257
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:52,588
there are gas exchange equipment that

258
00:10:49,929 --> 00:10:54,969
can be used made by like or and other

259
00:10:52,589 --> 00:10:56,980
technology companies that are certainly

260
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:59,860
used in high-throughput phenotype in

261
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:02,949
that help you to correlate what is the

262
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:05,318
correct amount of light and co2 for this

263
00:11:02,948 --> 00:11:07,058
particular plant I know in the future

264
00:11:05,318 --> 00:11:08,079
most production facilities will have

265
00:11:07,058 --> 00:11:10,689
used those

266
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:14,190
tools to figure out very specific

267
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:16,420
responses but yeah I hope that's helpful

268
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:18,340
yeah and one thing you touched on that I

269
00:11:16,419 --> 00:11:21,610
just want to highlight as you mentioned

270
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:24,399
that with the dimmable lights with LEDs

271
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:27,360
you can sort of progress the plant

272
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:29,949
slowly to these target ppfd levels

273
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,480
everything I've heard about LEDs and

274
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:35,680
I've never grown under LEDs I've only

275
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:38,560
grown under HPS technology you really

276
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:41,469
have to work the plant up you have to be

277
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:43,569
very careful to slowly raise the plant

278
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:47,590
to the to the higher light intensity you

279
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:50,620
can't just flip a switch that's one of

280
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:53,160
the but yeah strengths and weaknesses

281
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:55,029
it's that if people do not adopt

282
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:58,179
sophisticated strategies to

283
00:11:55,029 --> 00:11:59,799
incrementally graduate these curves in

284
00:11:58,179 --> 00:12:01,509
the production environment which of

285
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:02,979
course we can never just look at one

286
00:12:01,509 --> 00:12:06,519
element in the production environment

287
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:09,580
like lighting on its own and really get

288
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:12,210
a good outcome all of the variables move

289
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:15,879
together and in interesting ways and

290
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:17,920
correlating VPD with your light

291
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:20,950
intensity and stages of development for

292
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:23,079
diversity move ours is a lot of the arts

293
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:26,860
for those of us who are working to

294
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:29,410
produce novel team of ours alright great

295
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:30,850
answer so I just I assume it's a perfect

296
00:12:29,409 --> 00:12:33,579
gentleman I don't know why I assume make

297
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:36,550
a frost means it's a male but this

298
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:38,770
person also asked what caused your major

299
00:12:36,549 --> 00:12:40,539
crashes and living soils you had

300
00:12:38,769 --> 00:12:42,009
mentioned in the last episode that you

301
00:12:40,539 --> 00:12:46,149
had tried a bunch of living soils but

302
00:12:42,009 --> 00:12:47,590
had a lot of issues yes so as I mention

303
00:12:46,149 --> 00:12:50,139
I had some of the best outcomes I've

304
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:53,889
ever had it really it was pathogens it

305
00:12:50,139 --> 00:12:56,139
was over time whether there was rice

306
00:12:53,889 --> 00:12:58,899
rude aphid infestation that developed

307
00:12:56,139 --> 00:13:01,870
even after pretty thorough entry/exit

308
00:12:58,899 --> 00:13:04,269
protocols and ultimately having lots of

309
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:06,370
organic media and numerous factors of

310
00:13:04,269 --> 00:13:07,929
course humans and plants are generally

311
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:11,049
the worst but media behind that

312
00:13:07,929 --> 00:13:14,589
somewhere were the rusted mice and broad

313
00:13:11,049 --> 00:13:16,389
mites at some point I found at least

314
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:19,240
population of each of those three

315
00:13:16,389 --> 00:13:21,698
pathogens and using all of the bio

316
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:23,769
controls that I was employing which in a

317
00:13:21,698 --> 00:13:27,849
small garden we're talking like a 16

318
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:31,269
light garden spending around 3k for a

319
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:33,040
single crop cycle in biological pest

320
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:34,749
controls that were ineffective in

321
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:36,938
regulating those populations

322
00:13:34,749 --> 00:13:39,730
it just resulted in this kind of

323
00:13:36,938 --> 00:13:41,948
situation that I felt the media which I

324
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:44,470
had huge root zones there were one cubic

325
00:13:41,948 --> 00:13:46,628
yard custom-designed smart pots that

326
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:48,939
your four foot by four foot by four foot

327
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:50,709
I'm working with sort of deep

328
00:13:48,938 --> 00:13:53,379
rhizosphere dynamics and shared root

329
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:55,539
zones it just felt that if you had an

330
00:13:53,379 --> 00:13:58,028
entrenched population you could at best

331
00:13:55,539 --> 00:14:01,719
you sort of manage that population and

332
00:13:58,028 --> 00:14:04,470
many many successful growers continue to

333
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:07,629
cultivate with Rudy foods and other

334
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:09,069
nasty pathogens that are creating an

335
00:14:07,629 --> 00:14:12,278
erratic production environment that you

336
00:14:09,068 --> 00:14:15,639
can still with you know a lot of intense

337
00:14:12,278 --> 00:14:17,798
IPM management and focus they'll get

338
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:20,948
great outcomes but reality is they were

339
00:14:17,798 --> 00:14:22,358
just so varied and prior to the presence

340
00:14:20,948 --> 00:14:26,139
of those pathogens I was just getting

341
00:14:22,359 --> 00:14:28,569
such amazing quality of flowers but the

342
00:14:26,139 --> 00:14:30,609
bottom line is I think as long as you

343
00:14:28,568 --> 00:14:33,248
were very stringent like my friend David

344
00:14:30,609 --> 00:14:35,679
tea God in Canada if you haven't heard

345
00:14:33,249 --> 00:14:37,269
of him as a brilliant grower of course I

346
00:14:35,678 --> 00:14:38,858
think Todd is he he's been on the

347
00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:42,068
podcast yeah he's a good friend of mine

348
00:14:38,859 --> 00:14:43,809
he's been on the podcast a yes so David

349
00:14:42,068 --> 00:14:47,259
of course is doing living scale at soil

350
00:14:43,808 --> 00:14:49,868
it's living soil at scale and had some

351
00:14:47,259 --> 00:14:53,350
great protocols for how to manage the

352
00:14:49,869 --> 00:14:54,910
issues that he's endured at the end of

353
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:57,159
it I know I'm trying to do something

354
00:14:54,909 --> 00:14:59,828
that's closer to precision AG it just

355
00:14:57,159 --> 00:15:01,928
was about what your outcomes are like

356
00:14:59,828 --> 00:15:03,938
there are so many good ways to proceed

357
00:15:01,928 --> 00:15:06,129
and cultivating cannabis but I know I

358
00:15:03,938 --> 00:15:09,488
really had to adhere to something that

359
00:15:06,129 --> 00:15:12,579
was a reproducible media and a very

360
00:15:09,489 --> 00:15:15,759
consistent baseline so that I could get

361
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:18,099
to this high resolution insight with

362
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:20,079
team of ours yeah I think for our

363
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:22,778
cultivation facility that's not so

364
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:24,278
focused on science or on exact

365
00:15:22,778 --> 00:15:25,778
replication like you're really trying to

366
00:15:24,278 --> 00:15:28,328
pull a lot of research and data out of

367
00:15:25,778 --> 00:15:30,668
your facility which is amazing and I

368
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:32,378
think living soils does just introduce

369
00:15:30,668 --> 00:15:34,360
too much variability from what you're

370
00:15:32,379 --> 00:15:35,460
trying to do so and that makes perfect

371
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,830
sense

372
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:39,690
on the other hand we ain't we all may

373
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:43,110
die and bring every other species with

374
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:45,930
us if we do not mass adopt living soil

375
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:49,830
strategies as part of a mosaic to adapt

376
00:15:45,929 --> 00:15:53,069
more effectively to changing times again

377
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:55,620
never want to dissuade anybody through

378
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:57,899
some cheerful message that pathogens are

379
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:59,730
uncontainable or the erratic nests of

380
00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:02,009
living soil is not tenable because I

381
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:04,139
guarantee there's just all sorts of

382
00:16:02,009 --> 00:16:06,330
incredible cannabis in grown and living

383
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:08,159
soil pretty consistently at this point

384
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:09,899
in the market and I think it's a real

385
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:13,649
differentiating factor for commercial

386
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:14,970
producers I really cherish samples that

387
00:16:13,649 --> 00:16:17,179
are shared with me that are produced in

388
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:20,519
my model it's like you just say that

389
00:16:17,179 --> 00:16:21,838
yeah something that the Jaya Palmer a

390
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:23,789
good friend of mine and Suzanne

391
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:25,589
Wainwright Evans really emphasizes that

392
00:16:23,789 --> 00:16:27,599
we're not trying we're not able to and

393
00:16:25,589 --> 00:16:29,220
we're not trying to eradicate these

394
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,709
insect populations we're just trying to

395
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:33,209
manage them below an economic threshold

396
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:35,099
so all other facilities they work with

397
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:37,169
are dealing with these problems at some

398
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:39,769
point in time they got introduced into

399
00:16:37,169 --> 00:16:42,629
the facility I think it's inevitable

400
00:16:39,769 --> 00:16:45,629
more or less but if we can manage them

401
00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:50,129
well effectively then it's going to be

402
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:52,519
ok you know and not to gloat I will say

403
00:16:50,129 --> 00:16:54,870
after having endured hell where I

404
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:57,000
gathered genetics from around the planet

405
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:59,310
and had variety of medical gardens and

406
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,659
I've seen every imaginable pathogen I

407
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:02,099
feel at this point I mean certainly

408
00:17:00,659 --> 00:17:03,958
there are nastier viruses out there

409
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:06,328
somewhere and things that we have yet to

410
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:09,240
see I'm not to be overconfident but I've

411
00:17:06,328 --> 00:17:12,149
endured hell that said it is remarkable

412
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:15,029
to be in a commercially focused facility

413
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:18,839
with 16 environments and a team of up to

414
00:17:15,029 --> 00:17:21,119
40 people coming and going and to go for

415
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:23,250
nearly an entire year with not a single

416
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:27,119
pathogen and I'm talking not a fungus

417
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:29,670
not in an organic crop production based

418
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:32,189
facility I'm proud of that and that took

419
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:34,019
a lot of design and creativity and

420
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:37,470
passion amongst the team to be able to

421
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:39,660
execute but that is a good feeling on

422
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:41,130
the other hand that's pretty amazing I

423
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:43,410
mean to be able to control your inputs

424
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:45,890
so tightly into those spaces is quite

425
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:45,890
incredible

426
00:17:46,048 --> 00:17:49,888
well let me just keep things moving

427
00:17:47,849 --> 00:17:52,949
along I've got some more questions here

428
00:17:49,888 --> 00:17:55,979
this one comes to you from Lana Lana

429
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:58,139
Patrick I think it's pronounced Lana she

430
00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:00,329
said she has the opportunity to oversee

431
00:17:58,138 --> 00:18:02,788
a project in the more equatorial region

432
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:03,868
of our planet next year she's concerned

433
00:18:02,788 --> 00:18:05,849
because the temperatures are

434
00:18:03,868 --> 00:18:08,418
consistently around 80 degrees and the

435
00:18:05,849 --> 00:18:10,918
lowest humidity levels are about 65%

436
00:18:08,419 --> 00:18:13,049
already the drawn energy is going to be

437
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:15,419
focused on dehumidification and I want

438
00:18:13,048 --> 00:18:18,808
to try and eliminate as much AC draw as

439
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:20,610
possible having having worked as a

440
00:18:18,808 --> 00:18:21,839
cultivator in a large-scale scale

441
00:18:20,609 --> 00:18:23,638
facility in northern Carroll of

442
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:25,740
California I have extensive experience

443
00:18:23,638 --> 00:18:27,778
with double-ended bulbs but I don't have

444
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:28,589
any knowledge of the newer LED products

445
00:18:27,778 --> 00:18:30,749
that are available

446
00:18:28,589 --> 00:18:32,999
geremy briefly mentioned his success

447
00:18:30,749 --> 00:18:34,528
using LEDs what I'm hoping for some

448
00:18:32,999 --> 00:18:36,118
guidance on the different spectrums and

449
00:18:34,528 --> 00:18:38,099
how they effective engine flower in

450
00:18:36,118 --> 00:18:40,308
which particular brand has worked for

451
00:18:38,099 --> 00:18:40,308
him

452
00:18:40,548 --> 00:18:45,778
wonderful well I had a particular

453
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:48,298
trajectory where I think I mentioned in

454
00:18:45,778 --> 00:18:50,940
the last episode that I've tried a wide

455
00:18:48,298 --> 00:18:53,908
array of LEDs and the early days and

456
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:56,970
like most were less disappointed beyond

457
00:18:53,909 --> 00:18:59,999
the fact that using some deep violet and

458
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:02,240
ultraviolet lights and LEDs clearly

459
00:18:59,999 --> 00:19:06,149
produced more compact morphology the

460
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:09,118
intensity was lacking for creating sir

461
00:19:06,148 --> 00:19:12,148
generative canopy and/or balloon canopy

462
00:19:09,118 --> 00:19:14,220
but I will say that where LEDs have come

463
00:19:12,148 --> 00:19:16,618
to now is you're just night and day

464
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:19,470
there's incredible output there's great

465
00:19:16,618 --> 00:19:21,269
efficiency there's great spectrums there

466
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:23,220
are different spectrums for different

467
00:19:21,269 --> 00:19:26,548
things I think people are really at the

468
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:28,919
beginning would be able to answer which

469
00:19:26,548 --> 00:19:31,230
team of ours are responding to which

470
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:33,240
spectra which stages of development and

471
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:36,028
which intensities and that again is a

472
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:37,888
lot of the art right now but I've had

473
00:19:36,028 --> 00:19:40,528
the blessing of working with fluence

474
00:19:37,888 --> 00:19:42,658
bioengineering most closely it's been

475
00:19:40,528 --> 00:19:46,349
more than four year relationship before

476
00:19:42,659 --> 00:19:48,929
they were fluent they were B ml and I've

477
00:19:46,349 --> 00:19:51,569
really followed actually the CEO Nick

478
00:19:48,929 --> 00:19:54,269
clays who is now stepped down as they

479
00:19:51,569 --> 00:19:56,128
have been acquired by Ostrom and are

480
00:19:54,269 --> 00:19:57,868
actually scaling all of the tech that

481
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:59,179
they've built now into an international

482
00:19:57,868 --> 00:20:01,129
presence

483
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:04,190
with even greater service capabilities

484
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:06,760
and that I really feel that fluence has

485
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:09,559
offered authored a pretty unique product

486
00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:12,289
there are other great companies in the

487
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:15,079
LED space and just to say another name

488
00:20:12,289 --> 00:20:17,629
that I care about Neil yo-yo who is

489
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:20,449
actually a past NASA scientist who

490
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:23,060
founded BIOS lighting and also has good

491
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:24,620
products but like I said my main

492
00:20:23,059 --> 00:20:28,429
experience has been working with fluence

493
00:20:24,619 --> 00:20:31,219
tech and I will say that the physio

494
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:33,740
speck spectrum that they bring which is

495
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:37,400
based on the ceramic metal halide has

496
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:39,740
been very successful sort of closer to a

497
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,940
one-size-fits-all spectral solution that

498
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:43,609
you can use at every stage of

499
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:45,049
development and the great results are

500
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:47,599
happening there and there's a really

501
00:20:45,049 --> 00:20:49,269
sweet spot about efficiency wavelength

502
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:52,009
and intensity that they've achieved

503
00:20:49,269 --> 00:20:54,230
further I think the build quality is

504
00:20:52,009 --> 00:20:56,450
great the service the company is

505
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:58,640
provided it's great but there are

506
00:20:56,450 --> 00:21:00,470
certainly other companies what I would

507
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,320
say is that people who are looking into

508
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:05,690
the new lighting tech will hear a lot of

509
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:07,730
things about other lighting technologies

510
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:11,090
that are potentially you know superior

511
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:13,730
to LED and I won't i won't validate i've

512
00:21:11,089 --> 00:21:17,899
seen any version of like a plasma light

513
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:20,180
or another lighting source that is as

514
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:22,759
efficient or effective as LED I I

515
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:24,860
personally after reviewing as much of

516
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:26,180
the lighting technology as I can and

517
00:21:24,859 --> 00:21:29,659
have been able over the last especially

518
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:31,820
five years I feel that LEDs are the

519
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:33,620
future of court they're getting more

520
00:21:31,819 --> 00:21:34,899
efficient although you know we've

521
00:21:33,619 --> 00:21:37,069
departed from Moore's Law the

522
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:38,960
semiconductors are not having the same

523
00:21:37,069 --> 00:21:41,869
kind of big gains they were over the

524
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,970
last many years a new generation of flew

525
00:21:41,869 --> 00:21:46,209
inspect that just came out is more

526
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:48,740
efficient higher intensity better

527
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:50,900
formidable build strength than anything

528
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:52,759
before and I think we're just at a place

529
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:55,970
where especially if you can find energy

530
00:21:52,759 --> 00:21:57,859
rebates in your local region that offset

531
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:59,870
the cost of the lights you find that

532
00:21:57,859 --> 00:22:01,789
they're very cost effective and even if

533
00:21:59,869 --> 00:22:04,789
you don't get those rebates and you have

534
00:22:01,789 --> 00:22:08,659
bigger capex expenditure if you run ROI

535
00:22:04,789 --> 00:22:10,700
calculations on the reduced effects of

536
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:12,300
LEDs versus other solutions it's just

537
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:14,610
mind blowing I mean

538
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:16,829
pennies that don't wire with LEDs that

539
00:22:14,609 --> 00:22:19,469
have now invested all this money into

540
00:22:16,829 --> 00:22:22,049
double-ended HPS and so forth I believe

541
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:24,569
just by effects alone we'll be spending

542
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:27,750
so much more to create the same product

543
00:22:24,569 --> 00:22:29,639
arguably a lower quality than companies

544
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:32,369
that have wired with broad spectrum LEDs

545
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:34,530
that it's going to be like a difference

546
00:22:32,369 --> 00:22:36,509
maker for whether a company is viable or

547
00:22:34,529 --> 00:22:39,029
not because the cost of replating

548
00:22:36,509 --> 00:22:41,519
replacing lighting which is designed in

549
00:22:39,029 --> 00:22:43,710
concert with your HVAC for controlled

550
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:47,220
environment production is just immense

551
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:48,900
and so in any case starting with call

552
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:50,400
the fluence would be my personal

553
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,930
recommendation that i don't want to

554
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,570
they're not paying me I don't get

555
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:56,880
kickbacks I just have been well served

556
00:22:54,569 --> 00:22:59,099
and learned to use their tech in a way

557
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,720
that gets results that surpass anything

558
00:22:59,099 --> 00:23:03,480
I've been able to achieve through other

559
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,539
means yeah I joke sometimes that this is

560
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:08,009
turning into affluence podcast because

561
00:23:05,539 --> 00:23:10,680
most of the growers that I've had on the

562
00:23:08,009 --> 00:23:11,970
show are working with fluence in terms

563
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:15,690
of the lighting solutions that they

564
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:18,569
prefer now I know Nelson Linsley with

565
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:20,100
poetry plants has done some some trials

566
00:23:18,569 --> 00:23:22,200
using some other lights and there is

567
00:23:20,099 --> 00:23:24,119
some technology coming into that

568
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:26,309
industry space which is great because I

569
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:28,949
think competition only breeds better

570
00:23:26,309 --> 00:23:31,230
products for growers but fluence does a

571
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:32,850
great job we love that company I love a

572
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:36,539
lot of their employees they're just good

573
00:23:32,849 --> 00:23:39,269
people and I've been fortunate to be

574
00:23:36,539 --> 00:23:41,549
able to attend photo X and things like

575
00:23:39,269 --> 00:23:42,869
that where I got to meet you so I have a

576
00:23:41,549 --> 00:23:44,909
lot of respect for the company as well

577
00:23:42,869 --> 00:23:47,309
but I people do need to do their

578
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:49,050
research and it's such a challenge

579
00:23:47,309 --> 00:23:51,000
wading through all of the different

580
00:23:49,049 --> 00:23:53,399
marketing claims out there on the market

581
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,589
every led company seems to have their

582
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:57,540
own angle and it's really hard to know

583
00:23:55,589 --> 00:24:01,079
what to believe so you've really got to

584
00:23:57,539 --> 00:24:02,639
do your due diligence it is and and I

585
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:04,079
don't want to pretend to have the one

586
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,640
right way because one of the things

587
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:08,549
about our craft is that there are just

588
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:10,350
so many ways to approach the challenges

589
00:24:08,549 --> 00:24:12,990
were all confronted with as producers

590
00:24:10,349 --> 00:24:14,939
and yet I will say that it I've just

591
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:17,700
never had an experience with another

592
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:19,860
company that sort of I would I would put

593
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:22,710
to the same level of quality of service

594
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:25,229
quality of content and sort of product

595
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:25,890
innovation leaders as I had with fluence

596
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:27,960
and so

597
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:29,190
it's hard to not be passionate but it's

598
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,048
hilarious when you mentioned that so

599
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:33,840
many other people on the podcast have

600
00:24:31,048 --> 00:24:35,609
also raved about it I do know there's

601
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:37,259
other companies that are making an

602
00:24:35,609 --> 00:24:40,319
effort but as you mentioned they all use

603
00:24:37,259 --> 00:24:42,298
marketing language to support their sort

604
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:44,789
of lighting solution and what we really

605
00:24:42,298 --> 00:24:46,889
need is independent evaluation of these

606
00:24:44,789 --> 00:24:49,259
attributes how efficient is it

607
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:51,150
how intense can it be how effective is

608
00:24:49,259 --> 00:24:53,548
it and using different wavelengths and

609
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:55,798
you know really look at these serve in a

610
00:24:53,548 --> 00:24:57,509
more objective fashion but I think

611
00:24:55,798 --> 00:24:59,849
actually those were the things I looked

612
00:24:57,509 --> 00:25:02,970
at to evaluate fluence versus other

613
00:24:59,849 --> 00:25:05,129
fixtures and that it was cleared sort of

614
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:06,900
dominating course currently but I'm

615
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:09,120
excited there's new tech on the horizon

616
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:11,460
constantly one thing that my friend dan

617
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:13,379
gust effects from hybrid tech has talked

618
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:16,289
about frequently is that having

619
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:18,179
water-cooled LEDs will help the

620
00:25:16,289 --> 00:25:20,339
efficiency and for vertical farming

621
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:21,990
obligations be an exciting thing I

622
00:25:20,339 --> 00:25:24,178
personally have looked at these kind of

623
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:26,990
fixtures and see moving parts and

624
00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:29,820
flowing water with electric work and

625
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:32,160
plumbing challenges and a variety of

626
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:33,720
other issues that don't so far at least

627
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:36,298
from my perspective justify the

628
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:38,250
efficiency gains but clearly there are

629
00:25:36,298 --> 00:25:39,839
all sorts of imaginative things that

630
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:44,609
will come up as the industry's going to

631
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:45,899
scale anyways I hope that's helpful yeah

632
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:47,759
all right I'm going to change directions

633
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:50,610
entirely with this next question this is

634
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:52,650
from Blue Dot organics on Instagram he

635
00:25:50,609 --> 00:25:54,629
wanted to know when collecting pollen

636
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:56,850
from a male cannabis plant that has been

637
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:58,799
selected for desired traits hoping to be

638
00:25:56,849 --> 00:26:00,899
passed on to its progeny is there a

639
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:03,119
specific period in its flowering cycle

640
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:05,009
that was statistically speaking give the

641
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:09,119
best chance for passing on the desired

642
00:26:05,009 --> 00:26:11,400
trait so for example you make sure

643
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:12,989
another favorite oh yeah oh so you said

644
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,730
for example using Paul and they dropped

645
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:15,750
four weeks into flowering compared to

646
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:17,548
six or seven weeks

647
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:20,039
I would certainly say if you're

648
00:26:17,548 --> 00:26:23,789
introducing male pollen earlier and then

649
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:25,319
ongoing is better than later I say four

650
00:26:23,789 --> 00:26:27,539
weeks is I think a pretty general

651
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:30,178
consensus for where people are applying

652
00:26:27,539 --> 00:26:32,609
it because you have an inflorescence has

653
00:26:30,179 --> 00:26:35,429
made a pistol at mass it's broader than

654
00:26:32,609 --> 00:26:37,229
one centimeter that now can start to

655
00:26:35,429 --> 00:26:39,420
receive the pollen that you want to give

656
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:41,519
maximum opportunity for that

657
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:43,320
of course I think a lot of us are

658
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:45,779
actually moving away from using male

659
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:48,629
pollen and shining advantage in using

660
00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:51,899
Gaia Nisha breeding that actually is

661
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:54,360
more using a solution of maybe silver

662
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:58,830
thiosulfate or colloidal silver to

663
00:26:54,359 --> 00:27:01,079
induce served Ayesha tendencies excuse

664
00:26:58,829 --> 00:27:04,829
me Manisha tendencies in a female plant

665
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:07,139
to increase the likelihood of sort of

666
00:27:04,829 --> 00:27:09,509
genetic stability of the particular

667
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:13,410
expression of a trait sooner than later

668
00:27:09,509 --> 00:27:15,960
and not kind of have the X Y chromosome

669
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:18,720
come into the equation at all but in any

670
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:20,490
case around four weeks is a pretty I

671
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,960
think that's pretty generally what

672
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:23,910
people do and that's around what I've

673
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:25,470
done in the past so you're referring

674
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:27,690
tied to the process known in the

675
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:32,339
industry as feminized seeds or

676
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:34,920
feminizing seeds correct yes using that

677
00:27:32,339 --> 00:27:37,679
not just for the production of seeds

678
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:39,750
that produce lower no males but actually

679
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:42,450
to also use that as a tool towards

680
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:44,730
breeding in a targeted way to more

681
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:49,470
efficiently get towards a genetic

682
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:52,430
stability of a particular trait okay I'm

683
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:56,460
going to ask one of my questions now so

684
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:59,460
have you seen any level of like a chemo

685
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:02,460
típica Anor chemo var correlation with

686
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:05,100
pest pressure or pathogens in terms of

687
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:08,000
the plant's ability to resist these

688
00:28:05,099 --> 00:28:08,000
intrusions ah

689
00:28:08,029 --> 00:28:12,089
absolutely you know one of the

690
00:28:10,349 --> 00:28:14,039
interesting things when you think about

691
00:28:12,089 --> 00:28:15,720
the evolutionary origins of secondary

692
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:17,759
metabolites and actually only in the

693
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:19,410
last year is we learned from that team

694
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:21,390
of scientists and Canada I believe that

695
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:23,880
we're able to figure out that a viral

696
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:27,000
attack had occurred millions of years

697
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:29,190
ago that created it's miraculous bio

698
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,049
synthase in cannabis that results in the

699
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:32,910
production of cannabinoids and goes

700
00:28:31,049 --> 00:28:35,250
beyond terpenoids but the terpenoids are

701
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:38,220
largely considered to be a part of pest

702
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:40,680
defense response and clearly pest

703
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:44,069
pressure and pathogen pressure or any

704
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:46,620
kind of stress has a relationship to the

705
00:28:44,069 --> 00:28:48,119
sort of expression of a chemo var and so

706
00:28:46,619 --> 00:28:51,149
there are all kinds of different ways

707
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:53,158
you can explore intentional stress to

708
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:56,669
enhance the team of our profile

709
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:59,399
and even I heard a very obscure things

710
00:28:56,669 --> 00:29:03,869
like you know root pruning to induce

711
00:28:59,398 --> 00:29:07,798
stress certainly using mixed sort of

712
00:29:03,868 --> 00:29:10,069
photoperiod rhythms being able to induce

713
00:29:07,798 --> 00:29:13,138
stress through a broad array of

714
00:29:10,069 --> 00:29:15,470
potential strategies is what I think is

715
00:29:13,138 --> 00:29:19,019
kind of the palette we can work with to

716
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:21,028
explore the range a single genotype can

717
00:29:19,019 --> 00:29:22,798
produce of chemistry it's actually

718
00:29:21,028 --> 00:29:25,019
important sense is that I think in the

719
00:29:22,798 --> 00:29:27,179
old world and most of the world still

720
00:29:25,019 --> 00:29:28,888
sees cannabis this way is for if you

721
00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:30,149
have this plant it makes this chemistry

722
00:29:28,888 --> 00:29:32,608
and you have breeders who are kind of

723
00:29:30,148 --> 00:29:34,798
promising that seed providers who say

724
00:29:32,608 --> 00:29:38,189
well this these seeds are having this

725
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:40,048
ratio of CBD and terpenes and looks like

726
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:42,239
well when did you harvest it you know

727
00:29:40,048 --> 00:29:43,979
harvest timing is a huge variable and

728
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:46,558
what kind of chemistry are seeing or

729
00:29:43,979 --> 00:29:48,569
what level of chemo intensity what

730
00:29:46,558 --> 00:29:50,398
region and terroir and all of the other

731
00:29:48,569 --> 00:29:53,278
influences that are contributing will

732
00:29:50,398 --> 00:29:56,969
have a huge amount to do with what its

733
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:59,940
evoke but back to capuchin pressure I

734
00:29:56,970 --> 00:30:02,519
will say that I I believe some of the

735
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:05,820
really high results I've seen in terpene

736
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:07,528
oils in the past while past pathogens

737
00:30:05,819 --> 00:30:10,918
were expressed in the garden like race

738
00:30:07,528 --> 00:30:13,769
route aphids actually I saw not

739
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:16,950
consistently but erratically a result

740
00:30:13,769 --> 00:30:19,200
that was shocking like suddenly the near

741
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:22,379
3% oil producing plant which is already

742
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:24,869
a hile pretty monumental expression went

743
00:30:22,378 --> 00:30:26,699
to nearly a five percent for a single

744
00:30:24,868 --> 00:30:29,189
result and could I reproduce that hell

745
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:30,749
no that wasn't exciting to find and to

746
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:33,239
sort of news about the relationship

747
00:30:30,749 --> 00:30:35,278
between the stress of the pathogen

748
00:30:33,239 --> 00:30:36,840
pressure and the chemistry definitely I

749
00:30:35,278 --> 00:30:38,970
think there's a lot more work to do

750
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:41,459
around that and even back to an earlier

751
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:43,679
question you asked you know is it ideal

752
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:46,139
to have no pathogens well if your goal

753
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:48,749
is totally consistent phytochemical

754
00:30:46,138 --> 00:30:51,898
outcomes yes but there is a case to be

755
00:30:48,749 --> 00:30:53,278
made again for this maximal biology

756
00:30:51,898 --> 00:30:56,579
through soil food web

757
00:30:53,278 --> 00:30:58,858
everything coexisting and that actually

758
00:30:56,579 --> 00:31:00,868
that that can be an advantage in some

759
00:30:58,858 --> 00:31:04,228
situations for particular chemo for

760
00:31:00,868 --> 00:31:05,939
creation yeah we know that as a plant is

761
00:31:04,229 --> 00:31:07,080
naturally Sonesta here completing its

762
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:09,539
life cycle

763
00:31:07,079 --> 00:31:12,509
plant stress can have a huge impact as

764
00:31:09,539 --> 00:31:14,190
it pushes more energy into like you

765
00:31:12,509 --> 00:31:17,039
mentioned tricone production and and

766
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:20,549
this these expressions of various

767
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:23,308
chemicals you ninety-nine percent of the

768
00:31:20,549 --> 00:31:24,659
industry area now is still stressing

769
00:31:23,308 --> 00:31:26,789
their plants out in ways that we don't

770
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:29,550
fully understand and looking to reduce

771
00:31:26,789 --> 00:31:31,619
plant stress but I would love to see

772
00:31:29,549 --> 00:31:34,289
some research down the road of targeted

773
00:31:31,619 --> 00:31:36,599
plant stress as if we do create this

774
00:31:34,289 --> 00:31:38,899
certain type of stress on the plant at

775
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:42,049
this particular stage of its life cycle

776
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:44,790
we are going to see an increase in this

777
00:31:42,049 --> 00:31:48,000
particular you know this particular

778
00:31:44,789 --> 00:31:50,960
terpene or this particular cannabinoid I

779
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,609
think that I think we'll get there but

780
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:57,840
yeah plant stress is a fascinating topic

781
00:31:53,609 --> 00:31:59,369
I totally agree agreed and one other

782
00:31:57,839 --> 00:32:02,099
important thing I think that we should

783
00:31:59,369 --> 00:32:04,469
say is for all of the Kraft growers and

784
00:32:02,099 --> 00:32:06,029
producers who might hear this but I know

785
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:07,860
one of the most important things that

786
00:32:06,029 --> 00:32:09,629
occurred for me in the past was when I

787
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:12,479
had this run-in with the director of

788
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:15,030
research and a genomic company who

789
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:17,250
essentially was very very meticulous at

790
00:32:15,029 --> 00:32:19,980
what she did from a sort of plant

791
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:21,929
science background and came and looked

792
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:24,210
at some of the observational studies I

793
00:32:21,929 --> 00:32:26,550
was conducting to try to elicit these

794
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:30,569
kind of relationships and she was very

795
00:32:26,549 --> 00:32:32,609
critical of my process because of in her

796
00:32:30,569 --> 00:32:35,759
experience using plant growth chambers

797
00:32:32,609 --> 00:32:39,569
with incredibly exacting conditions with

798
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:41,369
a single factor that is changing you

799
00:32:39,569 --> 00:32:44,399
know creates really useful data but in

800
00:32:41,369 --> 00:32:46,589
our line I think most cannabis growers

801
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:48,809
are still looking at very complicated

802
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:51,299
environments and making correlations

803
00:32:48,808 --> 00:32:54,269
that are actually indefensible they're

804
00:32:51,299 --> 00:32:56,700
very likely incorrect and that these

805
00:32:54,269 --> 00:32:59,160
sort of assumptions and gut feelings and

806
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:01,710
loose correlations are not the stuff of

807
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:04,259
say for example studying a specific

808
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:07,110
pathogen pressure on the relationship to

809
00:33:04,259 --> 00:33:09,990
a team of are there has to be so much

810
00:33:07,109 --> 00:33:11,339
work put in on the front side this is

811
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:12,779
actually what I feel over the last

812
00:33:11,339 --> 00:33:15,389
almost two years at proof I've been

813
00:33:12,779 --> 00:33:18,299
working on is just getting to a baseline

814
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:20,669
that we can reproduce and then control

815
00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:22,798
for the ability to see the

816
00:33:20,669 --> 00:33:25,859
impact of a single variable change and

817
00:33:22,798 --> 00:33:27,868
that is hard and it's exhausting and

818
00:33:25,858 --> 00:33:29,788
it's not rewarding and it doesn't make a

819
00:33:27,868 --> 00:33:31,918
bunch of revenue or anything but it does

820
00:33:29,788 --> 00:33:33,898
give you the possibility of truly

821
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:36,509
starting to correlate things in a

822
00:33:33,898 --> 00:33:38,998
meaningful way so I just I guess I want

823
00:33:36,509 --> 00:33:41,608
to make a call for we all have to work

824
00:33:38,999 --> 00:33:44,009
with a higher level of rigor than we

825
00:33:41,608 --> 00:33:46,048
have in the past to really know what we

826
00:33:44,009 --> 00:33:48,538
know and there's a lot of mystic farmers

827
00:33:46,048 --> 00:33:50,548
and so you know like people have a lot

828
00:33:48,538 --> 00:33:51,960
of experience with the plant and I've

829
00:33:50,548 --> 00:33:54,749
had a lot of experience with the plant

830
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:58,590
too but that I've learned that some of

831
00:33:54,749 --> 00:34:00,839
the things I took as serve the truths

832
00:33:58,589 --> 00:34:03,388
that I'd experienced in the past I have

833
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:06,058
now disproven through better quality

834
00:34:03,388 --> 00:34:09,750
research and through experimental design

835
00:34:06,058 --> 00:34:13,199
that refutes conclusions that I had made

836
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:15,358
in the past so I think a producer could

837
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:18,298
never spend enough time on this idea of

838
00:34:15,358 --> 00:34:20,068
how do you optimize experimental design

839
00:34:18,298 --> 00:34:21,960
so that you can start to get

840
00:34:20,068 --> 00:34:24,269
high-quality insight because if you

841
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:26,490
really care about this thing to know one

842
00:34:24,269 --> 00:34:29,159
thing really clearly rather than many

843
00:34:26,489 --> 00:34:31,138
things in a kind of fuzzy way I would

844
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:34,019
argue is probably more valuable at this

845
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:36,240
point well I think that's great because

846
00:34:34,019 --> 00:34:37,829
you point out that that's really what

847
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:40,019
the mind of a scientist is if you're not

848
00:34:37,829 --> 00:34:41,700
trying you have a hypothesis but you're

849
00:34:40,019 --> 00:34:43,409
not trying to lead the data or the

850
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:44,908
research in any real direction you I

851
00:34:43,409 --> 00:34:47,818
kind of have to go with where it takes

852
00:34:44,909 --> 00:34:50,030
you and I think the big takeaway from

853
00:34:47,818 --> 00:34:51,480
what you're saying is that maybe as

854
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:53,339
cultivators and

855
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:55,199
consultants and people in the industry

856
00:34:53,338 --> 00:34:57,239
that work with this plant we should be a

857
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:58,649
little less confident with the claims

858
00:34:57,239 --> 00:35:00,149
that we're making based on our

859
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:01,889
observations because are all of our

860
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:04,019
observations are in a sense tainted

861
00:35:01,889 --> 00:35:07,199
because there is so much variability out

862
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:08,849
there in all of these environments and

863
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:11,159
you have said what I was trying to say

864
00:35:08,849 --> 00:35:13,440
far more directly that is it I think

865
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:16,558
there's there's a like a heaping portion

866
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:18,150
of humility about what we know and I

867
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:19,980
think a lot of that I want to just

868
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:22,588
appreciate and I certainly experience it

869
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:24,809
if there's insecurity if you're

870
00:35:22,588 --> 00:35:27,150
concerned about your future position in

871
00:35:24,809 --> 00:35:28,950
this space that's rapidly evolving and

872
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:31,048
you're seeing like proliferation of

873
00:35:28,949 --> 00:35:32,848
scientists and stuff it doesn't surprise

874
00:35:31,048 --> 00:35:34,610
me that there's a temptation to

875
00:35:32,849 --> 00:35:36,740
overcompensate

876
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:38,329
I just think it's important because we

877
00:35:36,739 --> 00:35:40,429
all care about serving this planet that

878
00:35:38,329 --> 00:35:44,210
there's a measure of self-reflection

879
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:45,949
about why we might compensate and you

880
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:48,530
know on one hand yes they're really

881
00:35:45,949 --> 00:35:51,199
people who are called to carry forth

882
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:53,420
this plants and and ensure that it is

883
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:55,939
available for future generations and the

884
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:58,970
highest level of use and so forth but

885
00:35:55,940 --> 00:36:01,070
there's also I need to be humble in the

886
00:35:58,969 --> 00:36:04,459
face of what is such an unbelievably

887
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:06,590
daunting and vast task as like actually

888
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:09,260
understanding these relationships

889
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:10,579
between chemistry and plants and humans

890
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:13,430
and their interactions with the

891
00:36:10,579 --> 00:36:16,909
environment and I mean it's really this

892
00:36:13,429 --> 00:36:19,369
big stuff and it is a humble task and of

893
00:36:16,909 --> 00:36:21,289
course like in science as well any

894
00:36:19,369 --> 00:36:22,909
result is a good result it's just very

895
00:36:21,289 --> 00:36:26,360
often you don't get a result that

896
00:36:22,909 --> 00:36:30,619
supports your thesis and more often than

897
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:33,860
not by far and so yes being being open

898
00:36:30,619 --> 00:36:36,980
to that yes and I don't think that

899
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:39,019
discourages artistry in the cannabis

900
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:40,550
industry on the cultivation side there

901
00:36:39,019 --> 00:36:42,050
are some people that do just have a

902
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:44,600
knack for this plant and growing this

903
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:46,880
plant and maybe we can't right now

904
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:48,619
science can't prove all of the ideas and

905
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:51,170
principles that they're using or pushing

906
00:36:48,619 --> 00:36:52,670
forward or what's working for them but

907
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:54,650
that might be because science hasn't

908
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:56,300
caught up with them too so I don't want

909
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:59,240
people to be discouraged just because

910
00:36:56,300 --> 00:37:01,100
they don't have a research scientist

911
00:36:59,239 --> 00:37:04,099
background I think we can utilize these

912
00:37:01,099 --> 00:37:05,389
tools as we grow as an industry but I

913
00:37:04,099 --> 00:37:07,039
don't think it that means that the

914
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:09,489
artistry is going away by any means

915
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:12,769
there's just too much room to grow still

916
00:37:09,489 --> 00:37:15,619
well said I I will say this frustration

917
00:37:12,769 --> 00:37:17,509
that I've had and having some media sort

918
00:37:15,619 --> 00:37:20,359
of exposure in the last especially few

919
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:22,220
years was I get painted as this person

920
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:25,130
who only cares about science and science

921
00:37:22,219 --> 00:37:26,659
and ever is everything and I agree with

922
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:29,269
what you just said that in fact I

923
00:37:26,659 --> 00:37:31,699
identify as an artist I actually

924
00:37:29,269 --> 00:37:33,619
identify as a musician I see chemistry

925
00:37:31,699 --> 00:37:36,829
is correlated with like you know

926
00:37:33,619 --> 00:37:39,739
literally musical frequencies and using

927
00:37:36,829 --> 00:37:42,769
mix engineering model of like Lowe's low

928
00:37:39,739 --> 00:37:45,469
mids mid highs and highs for what you

929
00:37:42,769 --> 00:37:47,360
would do an audio mixing I use that to

930
00:37:45,469 --> 00:37:48,500
produce kimo types in my garden I feel

931
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:50,780
that I'm playing

932
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:52,730
you know this sort of facility as an

933
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:55,460
instrument and that there's these

934
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:57,588
compositions with emergent if I wasn't

935
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:59,960
sustained by that deeper creative

936
00:37:57,588 --> 00:38:02,690
narrative there is no way I could

937
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:05,150
persevere through the detailed tasks

938
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:07,760
that science demands in order to gain

939
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:09,650
clear insight but if anything I'm more

940
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:13,040
artist than science and I think most of

941
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:14,119
us are and bid I also cherish the

942
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:16,909
insights of science and the

943
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:18,619
opportunities for us to serve people and

944
00:38:16,909 --> 00:38:21,828
this plant in ways that we've never been

945
00:38:18,619 --> 00:38:24,019
able to to go much farther but yet do

946
00:38:21,829 --> 00:38:26,720
not want to dissuade anybody from their

947
00:38:24,019 --> 00:38:28,009
creative process there will be a lot of

948
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:29,659
things we'll never be able to explain

949
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:32,240
that people can achieve through a

950
00:38:29,659 --> 00:38:33,769
miraculous relationship with a plant it

951
00:38:32,239 --> 00:38:37,098
is a relationship at the end of the day

952
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:38,750
always yeah and you mentioned something

953
00:38:37,099 --> 00:38:40,910
a minute ago that I thought was really

954
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:44,929
really interesting when you were talking

955
00:38:40,909 --> 00:38:47,568
about how it's better to know it's one

956
00:38:44,929 --> 00:38:49,549
thing really really well then a broad

957
00:38:47,568 --> 00:38:52,130
general thing without a very good idea

958
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:55,160
of it and that's that's interesting me

959
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:56,838
to me because at this soil scientist

960
00:38:55,159 --> 00:38:59,659
Society meeting I was I just got back

961
00:38:56,838 --> 00:39:01,338
from which was awesome by the way the

962
00:38:59,659 --> 00:39:04,670
fact that they would even had an

963
00:39:01,338 --> 00:39:06,199
interest in cannabis and we're willing

964
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:07,909
to have people come and speak about

965
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:10,279
cannabis and my goal was really just

966
00:39:07,909 --> 00:39:12,139
encouraged them to work in cannabis and

967
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:14,180
see all the gaps that we have in science

968
00:39:12,139 --> 00:39:16,578
but I was sitting next to this young

969
00:39:14,179 --> 00:39:19,669
woman she was a graduate student at MIT

970
00:39:16,579 --> 00:39:21,890
actually incredibly brilliant all of

971
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:23,690
these social scientists were and I was

972
00:39:21,889 --> 00:39:25,879
asking her about her research and she

973
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:28,970
was studying the effects of iron oxide

974
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:31,519
on methane production in soils and not

975
00:39:28,969 --> 00:39:32,719
looking at anything to deal with cattle

976
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:34,579
or cow production or anything like that

977
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:36,019
literally just the small amount of

978
00:39:34,579 --> 00:39:39,349
methane that's produced naturally in

979
00:39:36,019 --> 00:39:40,849
soils just this miniscule tiny bit of

980
00:39:39,349 --> 00:39:43,280
research that she knew really really

981
00:39:40,849 --> 00:39:47,269
well and that's one of the reasons I

982
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:52,849
think science takes so long is because

983
00:39:47,269 --> 00:39:56,119
we have this oh I lost you Jeremy let me

984
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:57,710
let me call you right back alright

985
00:39:56,119 --> 00:39:59,030
Jeremy good to have you back I have a

986
00:39:57,710 --> 00:40:01,280
new question for you here we'll just

987
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:02,450
start from scratch since I lost you

988
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,519
this one comes for

989
00:40:02,449 --> 00:40:06,649
my buddy Nelson Lindsley with poetry of

990
00:40:04,519 --> 00:40:09,139
plants he's been on the podcast a few

991
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:11,269
times he asks with all the work being

992
00:40:09,139 --> 00:40:13,699
performed by Jeremy and his associates

993
00:40:11,269 --> 00:40:16,068
how can one safeguard the genetic IP

994
00:40:13,699 --> 00:40:18,409
intellectual property from becoming

995
00:40:16,068 --> 00:40:21,829
subject to the same big pharma paradigm

996
00:40:18,409 --> 00:40:25,190
they're looking to reinvent and then he

997
00:40:21,829 --> 00:40:27,019
goes on well let me just finish reading

998
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:29,869
this so you can get the whole thing but

999
00:40:27,019 --> 00:40:31,159
it is a pretty tough question so he says

1000
00:40:29,869 --> 00:40:33,380
personally I struggle with bringing

1001
00:40:31,159 --> 00:40:35,149
superior medical cultivars into the

1002
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:37,369
public domain without there being a

1003
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:39,740
clear roadmap to its availability and

1004
00:40:37,369 --> 00:40:41,720
fair access to those who are in need as

1005
00:40:39,739 --> 00:40:44,029
well as incentive for its caretaker and

1006
00:40:41,719 --> 00:40:45,588
creator second to that there are only a

1007
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:47,210
few companies like Philo's who are

1008
00:40:45,588 --> 00:40:48,798
creating a database or catalog of this

1009
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:50,750
information and with the odds

1010
00:40:48,798 --> 00:40:52,699
speculative investment climate in

1011
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:54,530
today's market is unsettling to give the

1012
00:40:52,699 --> 00:40:56,539
keys to any castle that can be purchased

1013
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:58,099
and kept at bay from all of the

1014
00:40:56,539 --> 00:41:00,920
intentions expressed on this latest

1015
00:40:58,099 --> 00:41:02,269
podcast and then he says on further note

1016
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:04,068
is always a pleasure to listen to the

1017
00:41:02,269 --> 00:41:05,809
very articulate jeremy plumb who was one

1018
00:41:04,068 --> 00:41:07,579
of the few individuals I have ever met

1019
00:41:05,809 --> 00:41:09,740
that embodies the spirit of the garden

1020
00:41:07,579 --> 00:41:12,140
in all of his actions and is somehow

1021
00:41:09,739 --> 00:41:14,029
able to speak for an hour straight with

1022
00:41:12,139 --> 00:41:16,129
only a half dozen ohms or Earth's I

1023
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:18,290
haven't convinced urfu from a future

1024
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:23,030
planner planet and a better one at that

1025
00:41:18,289 --> 00:41:25,929
oh well of course I have to start with

1026
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:28,040
you nelson wensley is a unique and

1027
00:41:25,929 --> 00:41:29,509
unbelievably creative force in this

1028
00:41:28,039 --> 00:41:31,730
space and I've had the honor and

1029
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:33,829
privilege to get to work with him to

1030
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:36,380
some limited extent partly through the

1031
00:41:33,829 --> 00:41:37,640
fluence community and just so respect

1032
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:39,650
his work and I'm grateful for the

1033
00:41:37,639 --> 00:41:41,298
question I started to think he was

1034
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:43,099
throwing me a softball because he's

1035
00:41:41,298 --> 00:41:45,289
aware that I was a co-founder of the

1036
00:41:43,099 --> 00:41:47,440
Open cannabis project but then the

1037
00:41:45,289 --> 00:41:51,858
question got a little thicker so I

1038
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:55,579
respect this form a tiny bit about the

1039
00:41:51,858 --> 00:41:56,808
genetic heritage piece this is a podcast

1040
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:59,510
unto itself

1041
00:41:56,809 --> 00:42:02,180
really but I I do need to say a few

1042
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:04,910
words which is that there is a lot at

1043
00:42:02,179 --> 00:42:07,969
risk and if people have not woken up to

1044
00:42:04,909 --> 00:42:11,779
the terrifying reality that in advance

1045
00:42:07,969 --> 00:42:13,939
of federal regulation occurring the US

1046
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:15,510
Patent and Trade Office has granted a

1047
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:18,510
number of patents

1048
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:21,270
patent experts would consider to be weak

1049
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:23,820
claims and very unlikely to be able to

1050
00:42:21,269 --> 00:42:25,800
actually be defended but the fact that

1051
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:28,590
they've granted these plants without an

1052
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:31,470
ability to survey all of the prior art

1053
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:34,829
or the plants that have existed in the

1054
00:42:31,469 --> 00:42:37,709
public domain therefore not being able

1055
00:42:34,829 --> 00:42:40,319
to differentiate what is novel what is

1056
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:42,329
actually new and the outcome of some

1057
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:45,240
kind of intensive unique breeding

1058
00:42:42,329 --> 00:42:46,590
program and what was just in the chemo

1059
00:42:45,239 --> 00:42:49,139
scape what has been out there

1060
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:51,000
circulating with people who have risked

1061
00:42:49,139 --> 00:42:53,369
their lives and indications lost their

1062
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:56,610
lives in many cases done jail time in

1063
00:42:53,369 --> 00:42:58,889
order to persevere to make sure that

1064
00:42:56,610 --> 00:43:00,840
this plant is available for not just our

1065
00:42:58,889 --> 00:43:04,079
generation but future generations and

1066
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:06,329
that especially that you useful and

1067
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:09,269
uniquely therapeutically active plants

1068
00:43:06,329 --> 00:43:12,029
aren't taken off line in just a giant

1069
00:43:09,269 --> 00:43:13,949
land grab that then disallows the sort

1070
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:17,100
of folk medicine application that this

1071
00:43:13,949 --> 00:43:19,769
is a core theme for anybody who's

1072
00:43:17,099 --> 00:43:21,839
involved in the space and I think you

1073
00:43:19,769 --> 00:43:23,400
know it started to become a topic that I

1074
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:26,100
was passionate about years ago and in

1075
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:29,099
part dr. Mowgli Holmes a founder of

1076
00:43:26,099 --> 00:43:30,869
Philo's really in CEO was also

1077
00:43:29,099 --> 00:43:32,429
incredibly concerned with this and

1078
00:43:30,869 --> 00:43:34,789
actually started all of the initial

1079
00:43:32,429 --> 00:43:37,109
momentum and then I recognized that

1080
00:43:34,789 --> 00:43:39,000
after I saw the initial patents being

1081
00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:41,250
accepted that even though I didn't have

1082
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,440
time to do this work and like everybody

1083
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:46,230
else was really busy but I had to

1084
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:49,139
allocate focus toward ensuring that we

1085
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:50,849
have a response in defense of the plant

1086
00:43:49,139 --> 00:43:52,379
and in defense of all the people who

1087
00:43:50,849 --> 00:43:55,049
should be able to work with the planet

1088
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:56,640
so the open cannabis project I am no

1089
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:58,560
longer on the board for I stepped down

1090
00:43:56,639 --> 00:44:00,809
in December that has an amazing

1091
00:43:58,559 --> 00:44:03,150
executive director named Beth Schecter

1092
00:44:00,809 --> 00:44:05,549
and this world-class board including

1093
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:07,440
people from technology and legal space

1094
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:08,070
who are eminently qualified to address

1095
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:12,300
these issues

1096
00:44:08,070 --> 00:44:14,910
I would heavily I would I would advise

1097
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:17,970
everybody who cares to actually support

1098
00:44:14,909 --> 00:44:20,670
that effort both in money and time and

1099
00:44:17,969 --> 00:44:23,219
to chime in with Beth and find out how

1100
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:24,840
to support that effort because this is a

1101
00:44:23,219 --> 00:44:27,929
historic moment where there is a

1102
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:29,160
juncture that is like never been

1103
00:44:27,929 --> 00:44:31,469
afforded another

1104
00:44:29,159 --> 00:44:34,618
industry we have the opportunity to

1105
00:44:31,469 --> 00:44:36,058
protect all of that prior art and to

1106
00:44:34,619 --> 00:44:38,130
ensure those things are made available

1107
00:44:36,059 --> 00:44:40,140
for future generations and not just see

1108
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:42,539
it kind of disappear in the land grab

1109
00:44:40,139 --> 00:44:44,788
and that that's that's a really big deal

1110
00:44:42,539 --> 00:44:46,559
but it takes a lot of resources the

1111
00:44:44,789 --> 00:44:48,720
approach they've taken is to create the

1112
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:52,920
world's largest database of chemo tipic

1113
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:55,379
and also genetic in data to be able to

1114
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:57,630
help define the prior art and then to

1115
00:44:55,380 --> 00:45:00,059
relate with USPTO and others as an

1116
00:44:57,630 --> 00:45:02,548
advocacy group as many other initiatives

1117
00:45:00,059 --> 00:45:04,319
but it's just exciting to see where

1118
00:45:02,548 --> 00:45:06,389
they've gone after being the executive

1119
00:45:04,318 --> 00:45:08,518
director for a couple years helping get

1120
00:45:06,389 --> 00:45:09,989
it off the ground I just simply couldn't

1121
00:45:08,518 --> 00:45:12,239
continue to be involved in so many

1122
00:45:09,989 --> 00:45:15,929
efforts and I really have to focus on my

1123
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:17,699
work here at proof so that's what is

1124
00:45:15,929 --> 00:45:20,009
going on in terms of the genetic space

1125
00:45:17,699 --> 00:45:21,808
that I think is most important there are

1126
00:45:20,009 --> 00:45:23,809
other teams like strain ly and Canada

1127
00:45:21,809 --> 00:45:27,589
that are working in a similar way for

1128
00:45:23,809 --> 00:45:29,700
open-source plant Creative Commons style

1129
00:45:27,588 --> 00:45:32,038
intellectual property protections and

1130
00:45:29,699 --> 00:45:34,139
that's another important effort but in

1131
00:45:32,039 --> 00:45:36,380
case I am bias and believes you should

1132
00:45:34,139 --> 00:45:39,778
check out hope and cannabis project um

1133
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:41,548
back to his notion about the plants you

1134
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:43,289
know there are special is to be very

1135
00:45:41,548 --> 00:45:45,329
careful with how they come forward

1136
00:45:43,289 --> 00:45:47,250
because they could quickly get hoovered

1137
00:45:45,329 --> 00:45:50,430
up into some ecosystem that does not

1138
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:53,400
have the public benefit and interest of

1139
00:45:50,429 --> 00:45:55,858
the whole and in mind and heart and that

1140
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:57,750
really does matter so I work very hard

1141
00:45:55,858 --> 00:46:00,808
to find relationships with people that

1142
00:45:57,750 --> 00:46:03,179
have demonstrated ethics and the

1143
00:46:00,809 --> 00:46:06,240
complexity of the cannabis industry

1144
00:46:03,179 --> 00:46:08,489
which you know there's no sort of like

1145
00:46:06,239 --> 00:46:10,338
just black and white for me in this

1146
00:46:08,489 --> 00:46:12,959
space there's hugely challenging

1147
00:46:10,338 --> 00:46:15,000
frontier that we're all operating and

1148
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:17,009
working to build relationships that

1149
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:20,068
matter and that are forged based on

1150
00:46:17,009 --> 00:46:23,250
shared ethics is really an important

1151
00:46:20,068 --> 00:46:26,099
part of the work that I do and I try my

1152
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:28,409
damnedest to uphold that I tell you like

1153
00:46:26,099 --> 00:46:29,930
everybody we're all occasionally put

1154
00:46:28,409 --> 00:46:32,879
into a position that's uncomfortable

1155
00:46:29,929 --> 00:46:35,608
around having to navigate our own needs

1156
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:37,349
the needs of the company we're serving

1157
00:46:35,608 --> 00:46:40,650
potentially and the needs of a growing

1158
00:46:37,349 --> 00:46:42,900
market and the needs of a future

1159
00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:44,880
generation that yetzer arrives but

1160
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:47,910
we want to see get more benefit than our

1161
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:50,789
did from this amazing plant so I don't

1162
00:46:47,909 --> 00:46:52,798
have any magic formulas or recipes or

1163
00:46:50,789 --> 00:46:55,200
pretend to have some high ground as much

1164
00:46:52,798 --> 00:46:57,630
as it's a sincere effort that has been

1165
00:46:55,199 --> 00:46:59,639
lifelong for me and having always been

1166
00:46:57,630 --> 00:47:02,010
in a kind of activist position in this

1167
00:46:59,639 --> 00:47:04,710
space as well as in a creative and

1168
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:06,420
scientific discovery position I feel an

1169
00:47:04,710 --> 00:47:09,000
obligation to try to bring what

1170
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:11,068
eldership I can to the younger people

1171
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,630
that are now having opportunities to

1172
00:47:11,068 --> 00:47:15,329
make big impact and intellectual

1173
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:17,880
property and so forth but I will say we

1174
00:47:15,329 --> 00:47:21,240
need to get therapeutic plants out now

1175
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:24,690
they are not just type one ithc nursing

1176
00:47:21,239 --> 00:47:26,338
dominant to a core user profiles and

1177
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:27,720
that is a big part of the mission that

1178
00:47:26,338 --> 00:47:29,849
we're doing at proof it's a really

1179
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:32,250
resource a huge amount of plants that

1180
00:47:29,849 --> 00:47:35,519
look like what my friend Mojave called

1181
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:38,338
and Big Sur the early moderate THC high

1182
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:39,989
turpentine profiles that actually were a

1183
00:47:38,338 --> 00:47:42,088
very important part of the whole

1184
00:47:39,989 --> 00:47:44,969
community who was at the Ground Zero of

1185
00:47:42,088 --> 00:47:46,650
cannabis coming through the u.s. that

1186
00:47:44,969 --> 00:47:49,409
really went away when we got into this

1187
00:47:46,650 --> 00:47:51,750
high THC like one year seeing stuff that

1188
00:47:49,409 --> 00:47:53,699
you know is great for what it does it's

1189
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:56,608
just one note and there's this entire

1190
00:47:53,699 --> 00:47:59,068
spectrum that we can be addressing so I

1191
00:47:56,608 --> 00:48:00,869
think it's very important to now partner

1192
00:47:59,068 --> 00:48:03,538
with clinical research to be able to

1193
00:48:00,869 --> 00:48:05,970
differentiate these new profiles in

1194
00:48:03,539 --> 00:48:07,829
terms of the incredible therapeutic

1195
00:48:05,969 --> 00:48:10,348
actions they can provide and the quality

1196
00:48:07,829 --> 00:48:13,500
of life boom they offer and that that is

1197
00:48:10,349 --> 00:48:15,630
a central mission so withholding special

1198
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:17,639
plants from the market only to try to

1199
00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:20,460
protect them when they haven't even been

1200
00:48:17,639 --> 00:48:23,519
substantiated has other issues but

1201
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:26,278
finding ways to bring them forward with

1202
00:48:23,519 --> 00:48:28,920
agreements that feel like they're able

1203
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:32,400
to protect the best interests of both

1204
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:34,880
the the whole humanity and the more than

1205
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:37,318
human world as well as company's

1206
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:39,480
prerogative to make profit and try to

1207
00:48:37,318 --> 00:48:42,409
survive an unbelievably challenging

1208
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:45,389
startup industry as a startup company

1209
00:48:42,409 --> 00:48:47,548
that's that's challenging stuff and I

1210
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:50,098
know I have a lot to learn and I'm

1211
00:48:47,548 --> 00:48:52,528
constantly striving to find other people

1212
00:48:50,099 --> 00:48:55,528
who can help to shine light on that

1213
00:48:52,528 --> 00:48:56,500
forward path and I strive to do that for

1214
00:48:55,528 --> 00:48:59,230
others

1215
00:48:56,500 --> 00:49:00,969
I think I'm missing some other part of

1216
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:03,250
his question I don't know if you feel

1217
00:49:00,969 --> 00:49:04,839
that I had acquitted spoken to that no I

1218
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:07,239
enjoyed what you said and I would agree

1219
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:08,829
that I think but I met Beth briefly at

1220
00:49:07,239 --> 00:49:10,689
Emerald cup she's a wonderful human

1221
00:49:08,829 --> 00:49:12,670
being I had a great time chatting with

1222
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:15,579
her and I'm hoping to get her and also

1223
00:49:12,670 --> 00:49:17,289
the people over at candor over on the

1224
00:49:15,579 --> 00:49:19,348
podcast I haven't scheduled with them as

1225
00:49:17,289 --> 00:49:22,690
well they're doing something really

1226
00:49:19,349 --> 00:49:26,440
interesting from her Marian perspective

1227
00:49:22,690 --> 00:49:28,090
but I guess the question I would ask you

1228
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:31,869
based on this is in your own experience

1229
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:33,730
then so with proof and with Philo's if

1230
00:49:31,869 --> 00:49:35,440
you what it what happens when you do get

1231
00:49:33,730 --> 00:49:37,358
that special plan because you are

1232
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:40,599
beholden to investors you are a

1233
00:49:37,358 --> 00:49:43,389
for-profit business yet I know you have

1234
00:49:40,599 --> 00:49:47,050
this passion about preserving and

1235
00:49:43,389 --> 00:49:51,719
sharing these genetics how do you

1236
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:54,730
balance that between profitability and

1237
00:49:51,719 --> 00:49:57,789
sort of your own values in turn in terms

1238
00:49:54,730 --> 00:50:00,250
of how this plant should be shared well

1239
00:49:57,789 --> 00:50:02,230
one thing I'll say is that it was a

1240
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:04,750
miracle that I found the team that I did

1241
00:50:02,230 --> 00:50:07,358
that I found a team that was willing to

1242
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:09,219
entertain the notion that we could do a

1243
00:50:07,358 --> 00:50:12,639
lot to transform the space that we're in

1244
00:50:09,219 --> 00:50:14,679
and was willing to take risks and to go

1245
00:50:12,639 --> 00:50:16,960
up the steep hill and to pursue

1246
00:50:14,679 --> 00:50:18,669
challenging terrain and it didn't want

1247
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:20,949
just the lowest hanging fruit which is

1248
00:50:18,670 --> 00:50:23,619
all the immediate near-term revenue

1249
00:50:20,949 --> 00:50:25,719
targets and that that wasn't an easy

1250
00:50:23,619 --> 00:50:27,579
thing I don't believe there are a ton of

1251
00:50:25,719 --> 00:50:29,679
teams that are like that in the world

1252
00:50:27,579 --> 00:50:31,900
right now it's very challenging when

1253
00:50:29,679 --> 00:50:34,179
you're living hand-to-mouth to ambition

1254
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:37,119
to make a difference and kind of the

1255
00:50:34,179 --> 00:50:40,299
larger trajectory of the plant and to do

1256
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:42,730
that at scale is I mean it it is then

1257
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:45,180
and quite an intense experience to try

1258
00:50:42,730 --> 00:50:48,579
to be responsible for the various needs

1259
00:50:45,179 --> 00:50:50,829
and to those have a profitable endeavor

1260
00:50:48,579 --> 00:50:53,440
that can survive and exist in the world

1261
00:50:50,829 --> 00:50:55,358
and be supported and through doing

1262
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:58,210
meaningful service and providing a

1263
00:50:55,358 --> 00:51:00,369
product mix and sort of perspectives

1264
00:50:58,210 --> 00:51:02,889
that really help people and help this

1265
00:51:00,369 --> 00:51:05,500
whole thing to go forward and to keep my

1266
00:51:02,889 --> 00:51:07,989
eye on near the core values that I have

1267
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:10,329
always lived within this space and that

1268
00:51:07,989 --> 00:51:12,488
I feel the plant itself is arguably that

1269
00:51:10,329 --> 00:51:14,380
teacher of and one of the things I'll

1270
00:51:12,489 --> 00:51:16,478
say personally about how the plant helps

1271
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:19,179
me to navigate this is that there's a

1272
00:51:16,478 --> 00:51:22,509
reflective quality in those first

1273
00:51:19,179 --> 00:51:24,160
moments of a euphoric state where some

1274
00:51:22,509 --> 00:51:27,369
kind of useful chemistry has been

1275
00:51:24,159 --> 00:51:30,009
ingested and then there's quiet and

1276
00:51:27,369 --> 00:51:31,869
there's an opportunity to evaluate the

1277
00:51:30,009 --> 00:51:34,329
things that have happened maybe it's

1278
00:51:31,869 --> 00:51:36,670
wrong to somebody in a relationship

1279
00:51:34,329 --> 00:51:38,410
there was a subtle thing and in a moment

1280
00:51:36,670 --> 00:51:40,599
I was going 60 miles an hour and I did

1281
00:51:38,409 --> 00:51:43,358
not observe the way in which that had

1282
00:51:40,599 --> 00:51:45,789
impact on another person and then I have

1283
00:51:43,358 --> 00:51:48,728
an opportunity to pick that up to kind

1284
00:51:45,789 --> 00:51:51,429
of keep relatively clear in the

1285
00:51:48,728 --> 00:51:53,678
relationships that I meant by virtue of

1286
00:51:51,429 --> 00:51:56,439
using the chemistry the plant provides

1287
00:51:53,679 --> 00:51:58,809
and that I think that is easily one of

1288
00:51:56,438 --> 00:52:00,998
the most useful tools because reflective

1289
00:51:58,809 --> 00:52:03,849
time is something that's rare and our

1290
00:52:00,998 --> 00:52:06,568
very busy lives that actually affords us

1291
00:52:03,849 --> 00:52:09,489
the ability to live more wholly to be

1292
00:52:06,568 --> 00:52:11,889
responsible for the expressions that

1293
00:52:09,489 --> 00:52:14,259
were involved with still continuing to

1294
00:52:11,889 --> 00:52:16,989
persevere with ethics and style and

1295
00:52:14,259 --> 00:52:19,719
creativity and and to not just be you

1296
00:52:16,989 --> 00:52:21,369
know purely self-interested or ever in a

1297
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:24,099
position of you know harming others

1298
00:52:21,369 --> 00:52:26,619
intentionally and to then pick up if

1299
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:28,390
unintentional harm has occurred the

1300
00:52:26,619 --> 00:52:31,329
responsibility in the best way that we

1301
00:52:28,389 --> 00:52:33,489
can I think without the plant I would

1302
00:52:31,329 --> 00:52:36,130
never be able to attain sustain the

1303
00:52:33,489 --> 00:52:38,469
pressure cooker that is this kind of

1304
00:52:36,130 --> 00:52:42,849
modern cannabis industry unfurling

1305
00:52:38,469 --> 00:52:44,889
that's really the core guide so it

1306
00:52:42,849 --> 00:52:48,699
sounds like there really isn't a clear

1307
00:52:44,889 --> 00:52:50,170
path at this point even within our for

1308
00:52:48,699 --> 00:52:53,079
you and your company in terms of exactly

1309
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:55,749
what will happen when that special plan

1310
00:52:53,079 --> 00:52:58,630
does come along am I am I missing this I

1311
00:52:55,748 --> 00:53:01,659
mean I I'm hearing all of your question

1312
00:52:58,630 --> 00:53:04,199
more love for yet for cannabis and I

1313
00:53:01,659 --> 00:53:07,208
know I know you to be a very ethical

1314
00:53:04,199 --> 00:53:10,239
person and and I love everything you're

1315
00:53:07,208 --> 00:53:13,598
doing I'm just wondering is there like a

1316
00:53:10,239 --> 00:53:15,278
concrete way for people to preserve that

1317
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:17,979
in your eyes or have you disturb lished

1318
00:53:15,278 --> 00:53:19,958
one for prefered proof where when that

1319
00:53:17,978 --> 00:53:21,849
you know holy grail of a plant comes

1320
00:53:19,958 --> 00:53:24,369
along that could transform medicine

1321
00:53:21,849 --> 00:53:26,650
or or do whatever how do you what what's

1322
00:53:24,369 --> 00:53:28,239
your roadmap to balance that or maybe it

1323
00:53:26,650 --> 00:53:32,200
doesn't exist yet is what I'm hearing

1324
00:53:28,239 --> 00:53:33,939
possibly well that's part of it it's

1325
00:53:32,199 --> 00:53:36,879
that I don't believe actually there's

1326
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:38,559
going to be a plan that's V plan because

1327
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:42,340
we know that there's such a broad range

1328
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:44,889
of genetic diversity as a result of how

1329
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:47,559
extensively the plant has been out red

1330
00:53:44,889 --> 00:53:49,359
especially on the west coast and just

1331
00:53:47,559 --> 00:53:50,940
how many different things that can do

1332
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:53,349
for how many different kinds of people

1333
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:55,750
illustrate that it's it's just

1334
00:53:53,349 --> 00:53:58,299
tremendously diverse so that's one item

1335
00:53:55,750 --> 00:54:01,599
number two I think anything that we find

1336
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:04,420
that's useful especially in this early

1337
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:07,000
age of finally having chemical analytic

1338
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:10,780
tools to do an inventory of the keynote

1339
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:13,900
scape is really a potential that must be

1340
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:17,920
improved upon in order to develop into a

1341
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:21,579
more mature therapeutic useful tool and

1342
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:23,740
I think clinical researchers are the

1343
00:54:21,579 --> 00:54:25,860
ground zero of illustrating the

1344
00:54:23,739 --> 00:54:29,229
relevance of a particular team over in

1345
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:31,630
improving quality of life for a targeted

1346
00:54:29,230 --> 00:54:35,230
group and people like dr. a Depot and

1347
00:54:31,630 --> 00:54:37,840
dr. Ian Russo and dr. David Murray and

1348
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:40,420
others are really at the front lines of

1349
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:42,519
being able to indicate the utility and

1350
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:45,250
inherently because they're working on

1351
00:54:42,519 --> 00:54:46,750
those things not just in private

1352
00:54:45,250 --> 00:54:50,920
companies but also in public interest

1353
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:53,769
research there is a sort of opportunity

1354
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:56,470
whereas the insight becomes made clear

1355
00:54:53,769 --> 00:54:58,960
by virtue of say we've read ethan

1356
00:54:56,469 --> 00:55:00,639
Russo's newest paper and start to see

1357
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:02,590
gosh there's areas over here that we

1358
00:55:00,639 --> 00:55:04,599
should be focusing more research on we

1359
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:06,519
find that numerous producers around the

1360
00:55:04,599 --> 00:55:08,730
world may have access to things that

1361
00:55:06,519 --> 00:55:11,650
have similar inventory and all

1362
00:55:08,730 --> 00:55:14,199
collectively like good science get to

1363
00:55:11,650 --> 00:55:16,180
work on those potentials whether they're

1364
00:55:14,199 --> 00:55:18,489
siloed and purely in their individual

1365
00:55:16,179 --> 00:55:20,799
process or their collaborative and have

1366
00:55:18,489 --> 00:55:24,009
networked scientific organizations as we

1367
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:26,680
hope to see that's really I think how

1368
00:55:24,010 --> 00:55:28,390
insight continues to bubble i I think

1369
00:55:26,679 --> 00:55:29,609
that in the cannabis space especially

1370
00:55:28,389 --> 00:55:31,629
with people who have been

1371
00:55:29,610 --> 00:55:34,300
multi-generational and who really

1372
00:55:31,630 --> 00:55:36,099
distrust corporations and distrust

1373
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:38,619
capitalism rightfully so

1374
00:55:36,099 --> 00:55:42,369
there's a lot of sort of trauma that has

1375
00:55:38,619 --> 00:55:44,588
to be digested in order to pursue um the

1376
00:55:42,369 --> 00:55:47,079
most useful expressions of this like if

1377
00:55:44,588 --> 00:55:49,538
we withhold the one special thing and

1378
00:55:47,079 --> 00:55:51,940
don't actually figure out ways by which

1379
00:55:49,539 --> 00:55:54,789
to serve a lot of people with that to

1380
00:55:51,940 --> 00:55:56,679
demonstrate its specialness I don't know

1381
00:55:54,789 --> 00:55:59,049
if we're you know helping to protect the

1382
00:55:56,679 --> 00:56:01,328
plant or if we're actually keeping

1383
00:55:59,048 --> 00:56:03,699
offline something that might really make

1384
00:56:01,329 --> 00:56:05,380
a difference in the world's view of the

1385
00:56:03,699 --> 00:56:06,940
plant I feel actually the most important

1386
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:09,039
work is around storytelling right now

1387
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:10,929
it's great that those of us who are able

1388
00:56:09,039 --> 00:56:13,479
to work in its pace of innovation and

1389
00:56:10,929 --> 00:56:15,879
research are creating fruit that matters

1390
00:56:13,478 --> 00:56:18,998
but really the world still sees this as

1391
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:21,160
you know a drug that's harmful and it's

1392
00:56:18,998 --> 00:56:23,228
coming out of Prohibition era branding

1393
00:56:21,159 --> 00:56:26,708
exercise that lasted for decades that

1394
00:56:23,228 --> 00:56:29,259
continues to create all kinds of stigma

1395
00:56:26,708 --> 00:56:31,389
and sort of resistance between people

1396
00:56:29,259 --> 00:56:33,818
having a correct relationship with this

1397
00:56:31,389 --> 00:56:35,650
plant which you know there's no human or

1398
00:56:33,818 --> 00:56:37,239
there's no mammal that shouldn't be

1399
00:56:35,650 --> 00:56:40,150
interested in the potential of

1400
00:56:37,239 --> 00:56:42,548
modulating the endocannabinoid system in

1401
00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:44,709
meaningful ways to increase the quality

1402
00:56:42,548 --> 00:56:46,748
of life and and yet we have a very

1403
00:56:44,708 --> 00:56:48,879
limited to a cross-section of the

1404
00:56:46,748 --> 00:56:51,088
culture so far who's interested in that

1405
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:54,400
of course you see with hemp and CBD

1406
00:56:51,088 --> 00:56:56,108
broad and growing adopting sort of

1407
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:57,910
perspective that the chemistry in

1408
00:56:56,108 --> 00:56:59,828
cannabis is really meaningful but we

1409
00:56:57,909 --> 00:57:01,690
just have so far to go I really think

1410
00:56:59,829 --> 00:57:04,269
that there's a kind of humility in

1411
00:57:01,690 --> 00:57:06,309
recognizing how early stage we are to

1412
00:57:04,268 --> 00:57:08,379
sort of more broadly experiment but one

1413
00:57:06,309 --> 00:57:10,989
other thing I'll say classify is that I

1414
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:13,329
was really disappointed in Oregon when I

1415
00:57:10,989 --> 00:57:15,009
was working with a variety of other

1416
00:57:13,329 --> 00:57:17,528
groups that were very scientifically

1417
00:57:15,009 --> 00:57:20,650
inspired and focused on cannabis to

1418
00:57:17,528 --> 00:57:23,528
create this Oh hub campus that was

1419
00:57:20,650 --> 00:57:27,039
initially I think they're going to be a

1420
00:57:23,528 --> 00:57:30,150
site for state funded research there's

1421
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:33,579
actually a cannabic anibus research

1422
00:57:30,150 --> 00:57:36,278
panel that was authored I believe this

1423
00:57:33,579 --> 00:57:37,869
was in well I don't know the exact year

1424
00:57:36,278 --> 00:57:41,889
this was at the beginning of regulation

1425
00:57:37,869 --> 00:57:44,469
in Oregon that essentially a variety of

1426
00:57:41,889 --> 00:57:46,778
people were brought forward and told the

1427
00:57:44,469 --> 00:57:49,450
state that this is what we think you

1428
00:57:46,778 --> 00:57:51,159
should do you should allocate and

1429
00:57:49,449 --> 00:57:53,108
we Holmes was really one of the people

1430
00:57:51,159 --> 00:57:55,480
at the front of this but other people I

1431
00:57:53,108 --> 00:57:57,279
know Ethan Rousseau as part of this said

1432
00:57:55,480 --> 00:58:00,760
you should really consider allocating

1433
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:03,849
like 1% of your tax revenue reinvest

1434
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:06,280
that into public benefit research as a

1435
00:58:03,849 --> 00:58:08,170
means of like substantiating this

1436
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:11,200
economy that everybody's speculating on

1437
00:58:08,170 --> 00:58:13,990
being so important it even that got shot

1438
00:58:11,199 --> 00:58:16,149
down never happened there there should

1439
00:58:13,989 --> 00:58:18,639
be state sanctioned and supported

1440
00:58:16,150 --> 00:58:20,349
research there should be sort of public

1441
00:58:18,639 --> 00:58:22,598
interest research that are what

1442
00:58:20,349 --> 00:58:25,088
universities do and that are you know

1443
00:58:22,599 --> 00:58:28,030
that's if you go talk to academics in

1444
00:58:25,088 --> 00:58:29,858
the space like chemists and Israel named

1445
00:58:28,030 --> 00:58:31,990
Lumiere he's just happy to share

1446
00:58:29,858 --> 00:58:33,819
everything he can about what he's doing

1447
00:58:31,989 --> 00:58:35,348
and why he's doing it and he wants to

1448
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:37,329
meet others who are doing it so he can

1449
00:58:35,349 --> 00:58:39,430
do it better and that's great science

1450
00:58:37,329 --> 00:58:41,560
and it's just so unfortunate that

1451
00:58:39,429 --> 00:58:43,629
instead of having any kind of public

1452
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:46,119
benefit research other than a few

1453
00:58:43,630 --> 00:58:49,170
exceptions we see this ecosystem of

1454
00:58:46,119 --> 00:58:51,670
walled garden to the corporate

1455
00:58:49,170 --> 00:58:53,619
self-interest focused research for their

1456
00:58:51,670 --> 00:58:56,470
own benefit and their own products and

1457
00:58:53,619 --> 00:58:58,510
making claims their dubious and it's

1458
00:58:56,469 --> 00:59:00,309
really frustrating because of course

1459
00:58:58,510 --> 00:59:02,500
this is a plant that should be serving

1460
00:59:00,309 --> 00:59:04,480
everybody that is something that is

1461
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:06,699
certainly in public benefit but we do

1462
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:09,190
not have in any of the early regulatory

1463
00:59:06,699 --> 00:59:10,989
programs something akin to that instead

1464
00:59:09,190 --> 00:59:14,108
you continue to see University of

1465
00:59:10,989 --> 00:59:16,118
Mississippi mailing sort of our friends

1466
00:59:14,108 --> 00:59:18,909
were last in the medical program like a

1467
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:22,210
sort of series of joints that are 2

1468
00:59:18,909 --> 00:59:23,980
percent THC and moldy and and like you

1469
00:59:22,210 --> 00:59:25,960
just don't see this sort of shared

1470
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:28,119
collective interest research happening

1471
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:29,619
so I think that's a big loss I think

1472
00:59:28,119 --> 00:59:33,400
there's a lot of opportunities to

1473
00:59:29,619 --> 00:59:35,349
actually find wins and to build gain in

1474
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:37,210
that direction as we go forward and it

1475
00:59:35,349 --> 00:59:39,068
should be on people's mind but it

1476
00:59:37,210 --> 00:59:40,329
shouldn't only be companies doing this

1477
00:59:39,068 --> 00:59:42,159
on their own but that's what companies

1478
00:59:40,329 --> 00:59:45,579
have to do now there isn't an

1479
00:59:42,159 --> 00:59:47,529
alternative so that means that everybody

1480
00:59:45,579 --> 00:59:51,220
in my position or anybody who's working

1481
00:59:47,530 --> 00:59:52,810
in a larger company has to balance how

1482
00:59:51,219 --> 00:59:54,699
they're going to approach that and I

1483
00:59:52,809 --> 00:59:57,400
know that we found that proof and

1484
00:59:54,699 --> 00:59:59,139
amazing ability to kind of really thread

1485
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:02,170
that in a way that inspires me and keeps

1486
00:59:59,139 --> 01:00:03,338
me very interested in in the future and

1487
01:00:02,170 --> 01:00:05,619
what we can do for P

1488
01:00:03,338 --> 01:00:08,259
not just in our local region but around

1489
01:00:05,619 --> 01:00:10,269
the planet with insight and advocacy and

1490
01:00:08,259 --> 01:00:13,119
expertise that you know we've also

1491
01:00:10,268 --> 01:00:15,248
funded and that's a really rare thing I

1492
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:17,259
feel very lucky I know others that are

1493
01:00:15,248 --> 01:00:19,149
not so lucky they're trying to continue

1494
01:00:17,259 --> 01:00:20,349
to practice their craft within the

1495
01:00:19,150 --> 01:00:22,838
company that's not going to support

1496
01:00:20,349 --> 01:00:24,849
those same outcomes and I know others

1497
01:00:22,838 --> 01:00:26,858
who don't have the support of any

1498
01:00:24,849 --> 01:00:28,269
company who are working passionately on

1499
01:00:26,858 --> 01:00:30,699
those outcomes but they're doing it in a

1500
01:00:28,268 --> 01:00:32,288
marginalized scale it's so small and

1501
01:00:30,699 --> 01:00:34,298
it's so expensive and it's so

1502
01:00:32,289 --> 01:00:35,739
challenging to produce meaningful

1503
01:00:34,298 --> 01:00:39,429
results that actually make a difference

1504
01:00:35,739 --> 01:00:41,769
or meaningful plant at a tiny scale when

1505
01:00:39,429 --> 01:00:43,630
now there's been this era of mergers and

1506
01:00:41,768 --> 01:00:46,658
acquisitions and market consolidation

1507
01:00:43,630 --> 01:00:49,749
and we're moving to stabilization that

1508
01:00:46,659 --> 01:00:52,088
it suddenly you have to kind of find a

1509
01:00:49,748 --> 01:00:54,278
team it can support it but then can you

1510
01:00:52,088 --> 01:00:57,278
find a team with ethics that shares its

1511
01:00:54,278 --> 01:00:59,918
public benefit perspective to the extent

1512
01:00:57,278 --> 01:01:00,909
that I have God so rare tadd it's you

1513
01:00:59,918 --> 01:01:03,219
know and that's the heartbreaking part

1514
01:01:00,909 --> 01:01:05,140
of all this is that we know we could do

1515
01:01:03,219 --> 01:01:07,509
so much better imagine if there were 50

1516
01:01:05,139 --> 01:01:10,658
universities in the US with each having

1517
01:01:07,509 --> 01:01:13,478
a department like in Israel sort of like

1518
01:01:10,659 --> 01:01:15,358
a research grade academic support

1519
01:01:13,478 --> 01:01:18,458
department working together for the best

1520
01:01:15,358 --> 01:01:20,469
interest for the whole it immediately I

1521
01:01:18,458 --> 01:01:22,028
mean in one year we would have a very

1522
01:01:20,469 --> 01:01:25,380
different relationship with the same

1523
01:01:22,028 --> 01:01:27,998
shampoo yeah you know the idea around

1524
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:29,439
intellectual property that Nelson brings

1525
01:01:27,998 --> 01:01:30,998
up is a really challenging one and

1526
01:01:29,438 --> 01:01:32,338
you're right it's a whole podcast and

1527
01:01:30,998 --> 01:01:35,948
it's not something that can be easily

1528
01:01:32,338 --> 01:01:37,509
answered I will say I didn't do it the

1529
01:01:35,949 --> 01:01:38,769
best job either there's so much I'm not

1530
01:01:37,509 --> 01:01:40,929
saying I would like to say but it

1531
01:01:38,768 --> 01:01:42,728
literally is a podcast and I hope that

1532
01:01:40,929 --> 01:01:45,939
you get to do that and I think Beth is a

1533
01:01:42,728 --> 01:01:47,018
great start yeah the other I want to

1534
01:01:45,938 --> 01:01:48,098
just say the other thing you brought up

1535
01:01:47,018 --> 01:01:50,078
that I think is really important is that

1536
01:01:48,099 --> 01:01:51,849
we are really in the infancy with this

1537
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:54,309
with this plant and what we're learning

1538
01:01:51,849 --> 01:01:56,859
about this plant and the research that

1539
01:01:54,309 --> 01:01:59,979
you're doing is really sort of at the

1540
01:01:56,858 --> 01:02:02,139
frontier of where we're headed and it's

1541
01:01:59,978 --> 01:02:03,759
so wonderful so thank you so much for

1542
01:02:02,139 --> 01:02:06,489
all the work you do for sharing this

1543
01:02:03,759 --> 01:02:08,949
information with growers and listeners

1544
01:02:06,489 --> 01:02:11,559
and I hope we can stay in touch and and

1545
01:02:08,949 --> 01:02:15,159
continue to learn from each other as we

1546
01:02:11,559 --> 01:02:16,590
as we go okay thank you for building an

1547
01:02:15,159 --> 01:02:19,200
epic platform

1548
01:02:16,590 --> 01:02:21,600
have sophisticated conversations not

1549
01:02:19,199 --> 01:02:23,339
just soundbites and for all the great

1550
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:25,199
people in content you've already brought

1551
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:26,519
forward I'm honored to be here I look

1552

just really look forward to you

1554

continuing to help people to see some of

1555
01:02:31,230 --> 01:02:35,789
the nuance and intricacy in the space we

1556
01:02:33,210 --> 01:02:40,099
can all respond more effectively to the

1557
01:02:35,789 --> 01:02:40,099
challenge ahead thank you my friend

1558

that was Jeremy plumb director of

1559
01:02:43,079 --> 01:02:46,529
production science improved cultivar

1560
01:02:44,789 --> 01:02:48,300
I've posted a ton of links to
