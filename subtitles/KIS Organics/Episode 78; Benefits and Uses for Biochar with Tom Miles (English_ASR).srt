developing countries

29
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,159
his knowledge of ash transformations and

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,239
biomass led to recycling nutrients using

31
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,760
pyrolysis of residues to biochar

32
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:13,839
which can improve soil health and

33
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,840
sequester carbon he has sponsors and

34
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,400

35
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,759
energy and biochar since 1994.

36
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,680
he is a past chairman of the

37

40
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:31,600
now on to the show hey tom thanks for

41
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:31,599
coming on the show today

42
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:36,879
well thank you it's good to be here yeah

43
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:40,879
so tom can we start off with you telling

44
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:43,679
me a little bit about yourself

45
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:44,798
well i am a an engineering consultant in

46
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,600
portland oregon

47
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,640
uh fourth generation in wood products in

48
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:50,798
oregon

49
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,200
and so i grew up in the wood products

50
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:55,040
industry if you will

51
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,478
our firm has been doing mechanical

52
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,360
engineering for

53
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:01,280
wood products and renewable energy for a

54
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:06,078
few generations now

55
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:08,800
and about 15 years ago

56
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:10,239
after spending something like 25 years

57
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,560
working with

58
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,560
renewable energy projects everything

59
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:18,000
from improved cooking stoves to

60
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:20,239
very large biomass boilers

61
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,280
was about the time that biochar was

62
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,520
rediscovered

63
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,800
and we always have a certain amount of

64
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,439
the

65
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,680
charcoal as a co-product or byproduct of

66
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:30,878
combustion gasification pyrolysis

67
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,360
processes

68
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:35,039
and when i learned that the that biochar

69
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,080
could be used to

70
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:40,799
manage nutrients from manures and that

71
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,800
sort of thing i got

72
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,360
got interested in the use of biochar

73
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,360
production of biochar as a co-product of

74
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,560
biomass energy and the use of biochar

75
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,599
for

76
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:54,719
improving soils and and managing uh

77
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:56,799
managing nutrients and i uh

78
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:58,318
i worked with my father for about 25

79
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,439
years and and i've been

80
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:04,639
uh on my own for about 20 years and

81
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:08,000
uh at my office is here

82
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:09,919
again in in portland and my role with

83
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,800
the u.s biochar initiative

84
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:14,000
we created the u.s biochar initiative in

85
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,040
2010

86
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,639
and i've been the executive director of

87
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:21,759
the organization for the last five or

88
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:24,958
six years we're all volunteers

89
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:26,959
trying to create biochar as a

90
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,360
as a business and as a productive

91
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,360
enterprise

92
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:33,839
that's great so let's uh let's go back a

93
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,959
little bit

94
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:40,319
and just cover the basics for folks who

95
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:42,479
aren't as familiar with biochar

96
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:45,039
you know a lot of people when they talk

97
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:47,679
about biochar they think of

98
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:49,039
the amazon basin and put maybe like

99
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,519
terra preda

100
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:53,039
but that's obviously a very different

101
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,959
product than what we're producing with

102
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:55,759
biochar but there is some relationship

103
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,799
there can you

104
00:03:55,759 --> 00:04:01,199
maybe touch on that a little bit well we

105
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,840
can start with tara prata i led a

106
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:04,878
group uh from the international biochar

107
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,479
initiative

108
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:10,479
uh we we had a conference in brazil in

109
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:14,079
2010 in rio

110
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:17,599
de janeiro and we went up to the amazon

111
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,400
where ambrapa the brazilian research

112
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,239
organization

113
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,758
agricultural research research

114
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:25,120
organization had

115
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,960
dug pits for us in the soils that were

116
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,240
both terraprita and what they call terra

117
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:29,918
mulatta

118
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,240
and i wound up being the interpreter for

119
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:35,599
the trip uh having lived in brazil and

120
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:38,160
speak portuguese and so on

121
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,720
and it was interesting to me to discover

122
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,639
uh the

123
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,800
the along the banks of the amazon

124
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:45,280
growing up we were told that

125
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,319
the amazon had this rich soil the

126
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:49,758
amazons has

127
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:52,000
has rich tropical life and

128
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,560
that drops nutrients down to the soil

129
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,918
but the soils are actually very poor

130
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,959
clay soils and as it happens

131
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:02,879
uh along the banks of the amazon where

132
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:04,719
the natives lived

133
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:05,918
over the last three or four thousand

134
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,600
years

135
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:11,359
they would grow their crops around their

136
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,919
around their dwellings and then they

137
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:17,120
would burn that crop residue

138
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:20,560
um both wood and grasses and so on

139
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,079
and leave a charcoal residue and there's

140
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,079
some debate as to whether they need the

141
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:26,240
charcoal intentionally or not

142
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:27,839
but that then would combine with

143
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,439
nutrients in the form

144
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:35,119
of their kitchen waste and sewage

145
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:38,560
and compost together and become a

146
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:41,840
combined with the clay soil and become a

147
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:44,560
a rich charcoal rich

148
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:47,679
carbon rich compound and the carbon

149
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:50,319
would capture the nutrients from the uh

150
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,639
from the vegetation and so that it

151
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:54,639
wouldn't leach down and just into the

152
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,918
group that would stay there and the

153
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,639
natives were cropping

154
00:05:55,918 --> 00:06:00,719
annually uh every year on the same soil

155
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,079
without going into the slash and burn

156
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,600
into the jungle

157
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:05,519
and so when the spanish and portuguese

158
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,960
arrived they found the natives is

159
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:10,159
with a fairly uh rich native culture and

160
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:11,519
civilization

161
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,000
so that's where a lot of the stories

162
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:16,000
came from the uh the stories of

163
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,279
the amazon women and the and the men

164
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,639
covered in gold and

165
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:22,318
these kinds of things the

166
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,879
spanish and portuguese priests and

167
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:27,759
explorers found

168
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:30,560
that basically these natives had a a

169
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:32,080
good renewable regenerative agriculture

170
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,079
and a strip not more than about a

171
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:35,839
hundred yards wide on either side of the

172
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:38,159
amazon but if you follow

173
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:40,159
all the way up the main trunk of the

174
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,520
amazon main river and then it splits

175
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,520
into two different rivers

176
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:45,439
and you add all those soils together

177
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:45,839
there's an area the size of france that

178
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:48,879
was

179
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:52,079
enriched with this charcoal enriched

180
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:53,120
soil and so if we look at at biochar

181
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:56,318
what biochar

182
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:58,000
is is charcoal that is made instead of

183
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:01,840
charcoal that's made for

184
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,918
cooking the cooking charcoal typically

185
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:06,000
contains

186
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:07,918
tars and oils to help ignite the

187
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,959
charcoal

188
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:12,240
the biochar is you cook it long enough

189
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:14,318
so that you

190
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,560
have baked out the tars and oils and so

191
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:19,439
you have this nice honeycomb

192
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,598
kind of structure and so it has physical

193
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,879
properties that are very similar to

194
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:25,279
some of the soil amendments like

195
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:27,120
vermiculite and perlite

196
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:29,439
and it has chemical properties and it

197
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:34,000
will have surface area that will

198
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:36,319
absorb both absorb and adsorb

199
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,560
chemicals and nutrients potassium and so

200
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:41,598
on many of the soluble nutrients that

201
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,680
that are available from

202
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:45,120
not only from manures but plants and so

203
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,879
on

204
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,800
and then scientists are now discovering

205
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:52,080
that it also has

206
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:55,199
electrochemical properties which assist

207
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:55,839
in the with the metabolism for example

208
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:00,400
that

209
00:07:55,839 --> 00:08:02,799
feed to animals uh it actually helps the

210
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:04,959
metabolism and the rumen improves the

211
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,199
efficiency of feed conversion

212
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:08,799
uh helps keep animals healthy and so on

213
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,439
and so you have these

214
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,400
these physical chemical and biological

215
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:15,360
uh

216
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:16,638
attributes of the biochar the biochars

217
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,199
themselves are good

218
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:21,280
habitats for microorganisms and so

219
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,520
biochars have sometimes been described

220
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:25,198
as

221
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:26,000
geo batteries and that they can hang on

222
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,000
to

223
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,800
chemicals and nutrients they can help

224
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
cycle carbon from photosynthesis

225
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:36,320
through the soil solution and uh

226
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,158
and thereby help both with not only with

227
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,278
carbon cycle but also with the nutrient

228
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:41,759
cycle and help to feed the

229
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:42,958
microorganisms that are so important

230
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:45,039
so the difference really between the

231
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:48,719
biochar and the terra freita is that

232
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:52,639
terra preta was the full full package

233
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:55,600
of a basically a composted

234
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:56,799
biochar mineral complex the biochar plus

235
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,879
clay plus

236
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:02,159
uh the nutrients and the biochar

237
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:04,159
is the building block it's just

238
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:04,879
basically the the charcoal but it's

239
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:07,360
charcoal

240
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:08,000
for use in the soil and the term biochar

241
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,480
was coined

242
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,080
by our friend the late dr peter reed

243
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,440
from new zealand

244
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:18,560
uh who felt that we should use a term

245
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:21,040
of charcoal intended for use in the soil

246
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:23,838
rather than charcoal intended for use

247
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:23,838
as a fuel

248
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,600
well that's great i wasn't aware of that

249
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,800
benefit with

250
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,680
the rumen with livestock that's really

251
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:35,359
interesting

252
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:37,439
um i would i would be curious the same

253
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,320
yeah the same electrochemical properties

254
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,560
also reduce the amount of energy

255
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,360
that it takes to transfer nutrients to

256
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:45,518
plant roots

257
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:49,039
and so it's also partly what's

258
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:51,440
responsible for the efficient

259
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:52,958
as you well know uh wherever we use

260
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,519
biochar

261
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:56,879
um it in the root zone and the

262
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,278
rhizosphere

263
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:00,480
we get this really generous rick growth

264
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:03,200
a very active

265
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,159
root growth and so now it's being used

266
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,640
for example

267
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:08,639
as backfill and planting urban trees and

268
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:11,759
landscaping because

269
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:14,639
early on it helps the tree establish

270
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:16,559
really vigorous root structures and it

271
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:20,159
turns out that part of the mechanism

272
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:21,359
is that by facilitating the transfer of

273
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:24,639
nutrients to the

274
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:28,399
root hairs with the tree roots it

275
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:28,399
helps to encourage that root growth

276
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:34,719
so how do we make biochar ranging

277
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,480
from you know a commercial operation

278
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,920
down to someone who just wanted to try

279
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,120
experimenting with home i mean you

280
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:40,319
touched on the fact that we don't want

281
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,799
to be using

282
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,839
charcoal necessarily and that there is a

283
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:45,599
difference there

284
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,519
can you can you touch on how it's how

285
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,879
it's made in the importance of

286
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:53,360
you know the pyrolysis process

287
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:54,240
well let's start with uh with where i

288
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,600
started

289
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,200
and that is with with wood with either

290
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,920
wood or grasses

291
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,320
you start with biomass and the biomass

292
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:08,000
contains about 50 percent carbon

293
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:12,480
in its structure and as you

294
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,480
heat the biomass that solid converts to

295
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,560
gas about 80 percent of the solid

296
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,920
converts to a gas and about 20 percent

297
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:21,518
of the solid

298
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:23,120
uh converts to charcoal and

299
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,120
so when you're burning wood for example

300
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,600
as you can see in your fireplace what

301
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,839
you can see the little uh gas coming out

302
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,519
of the fire log

303
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,440
that accounts for about 80 percent of

304
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,839
the mass of that car log converts to a

305
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,560
gas and then it burns as a gas

306
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:40,560
whereas about 20 percent burns as

307
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:41,518
charcoal and you can see in the glowing

308
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:43,518
coals

309
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,519
actually the glow in the coals is

310
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:48,799
actually

311
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:50,720
the those are more tars and volatiles

312
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:53,199
that are just simply burning on the

313
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,079
surface of the charcoal but the charcoal

314
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,200
will burn

315
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:58,958
in direct contact with air the charcoal

316
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,480
doesn't need to convert to a gas to burn

317
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:02,159
it can it can burn and direct at the

318
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,600
right temperature it can burn in direct

319
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:06,000
contact with air

320
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,000
and uh by burning it's basically

321
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,879
oxidizing it's the oxygen

322
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,159
reacting with the carbon and creating

323
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:14,720
co2

324
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:16,958
so in order to make charcoal we need to

325
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,600
heat the biomass

326
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:21,119
and you can heat it in different ways

327
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,720
you can heat it through what's called

328
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,399
pyrolysis where you heat it

329
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,800
in the absence of air you don't you're

330
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:30,000
not adding any air

331
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:32,159
and sometimes this is done by putting

332
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
biomass into a canister and then putting

333
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:36,559
the canister into a fire and then

334
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,240
providing the heat from the outside

335
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:39,759
and you're doing the same thing you need

336
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,320
a place to to

337
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:44,078
vent that canister because the solid

338
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,120
will convert to a gas and the gas will

339
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:47,039
come out and

340
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,399
when you ignite that gas you see that

341
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:51,759
it's a it's a it's a

342
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:54,480
combustible gas you've converted the

343
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:56,399
solid to a form that can burn the next

344
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,839
step is called gasification

345
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:01,919
and in that case you're using a third

346
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,279
ear that you would ordinarily use to

347
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:06,399
completely burn

348
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:07,919
the solid and you can think of it as

349
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,839
burning about a third of the

350
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:11,599
uh a third of the wood to convert the

351
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,600
rest of the wood to gas

352
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,879
so in that case uh in the case of

353
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,959
pyrolysis

354
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,879
your char yield is going to be in the 20

355
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:20,958
to 30 percent range

356
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:23,919
of the of the dry weight of the wood you

357
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:26,638
start with in the case of gasification

358
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:27,679
uh the yield typically is in the 15

359
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,240
range

360
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:30,879
because some of that some of the air

361
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,360
reacts

362
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:35,600
that you've introduced reacts directly

363
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,680
with that charcoal converts it to co2

364
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,399
and so it reduces the amount of

365
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:41,439
charcoal yield and the rest converts to

366
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,679
gas which

367
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,800
hopefully you use and recover in some

368
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:47,519
way to

369
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:48,159
generate heat or power and the third

370
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,480
mechanism

371
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:51,759
is simply through combustion or

372
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,800
ordinarily burning

373
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:58,559
wood you always have charcoal embers

374
00:13:54,799 --> 00:14:01,439
left over or in a a boiler

375
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:03,119
typically you'll have fine charcoal

376
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,639
particles that will carry out of the

377
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,120
boiler with the

378
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:09,519
combustion gases and those can be

379
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:12,078
separated

380
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,879
in the gas cleaning device and recovered

381
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:17,278
and used

382
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:19,919
as biochar so in each one of those cases

383
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:22,480
you want the material to get to a

384
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:26,399
temperature that's in the

385
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:29,440
in the centigrade range in the 300 to

386
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:32,958
350 to 400 to 600 degree

387
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:34,560
centigrade range for uh most jars you

388
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:36,479
get high temperature charge that are

389
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:38,879
above 600 degrees centigrade

390
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,000
to put that in perspective in terms of

391
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:42,078
fahrenheit

392
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,320
typically the gasification range where

393
00:14:42,078 --> 00:14:46,559
you add a little bit of air gets you

394
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,879
into the 12 to 1400 degree fahrenheit

395
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:50,638
range combustion will get into the 15 to

396
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:53,679
1800 degree

397
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:57,519
temperature range and pyrolysis

398
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:58,638
you hold down to the 800 to 1000 degree

399
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:02,320
range

400
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:03,919
um to provide each of those

401
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:07,199
products now the simplest way to make

402
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:09,039
biochar is in what's called a pit kiln

403
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:12,000
in which you simply dig a

404
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:12,719
pit a conical pit or a sleep-sided pet

405
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,519
and

406
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,879
put the biomass in in malawi for example

407
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:20,560
we have

408
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:22,879
smallholders who farm small plots of

409
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:23,919
land and in that case they dig a small

410
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:26,958
pet

411
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:28,719
and take their corn stover from their

412
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:31,198
corn stove or their corn or maize

413
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:35,040
harvest and put it in the pit

414
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:39,519
and the pit is as steep sides

415
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:42,639
and by lighting the

416
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:44,799
lighting the material from the top

417
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,000
it tends to it's what we call a top lit

418
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:49,919
updraft

419
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,000
the heat from radiant heat from burning

420
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:54,479
material on the top tends to heat the

421
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,440
material that's below it in the pit

422
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,879
and the pit contains the keeps the

423
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,320
oxygen from

424
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:02,639
getting to the material and so the

425
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,600
material is sitting there bathing in a

426
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,000
pool of

427
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,040
so-called pyrolysis gases the gases that

428
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,278
evolved from

429
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:10,078
heating the material and that tends to

430
00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:11,759
to promote

431
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:13,439
charcoal production and so they wind up

432
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,680
making a charcoal

433
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,680
and they make it that it winds up being

434
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:19,120
made at a low enough temperature so that

435
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:21,278
a lot of the nutrients in the corn

436
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,519
stover aren't cooked off

437
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:24,399
and so they take that they eventually

438
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,278
cover the pit

439
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,480
to cool off the char and take the char

440
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:30,480
and

441
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,159
combine it with a nutrient source

442
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,399
typically manure

443
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:35,600
at planting and they plant their corn

444
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,399
crop and

445
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,639
so that's one way of of making in a pit

446
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,639
kiln you're basically

447
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,159
using the radiant heat from the gaseous

448
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,799
combustion to

449
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:47,439
heat the solid convert the solid to char

450
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:50,639
and gas

451
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:53,759
and then you use the char beneficially

452
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:56,879
in the in the soil another way of making

453
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:59,839
biochar is in a

454
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:00,639
in a gasifier where you use add a little

455
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,440
bit of air

456
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:05,038
to burn some of the gas to provide heat

457
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,400
to

458
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:10,078
char or carbonize the fuel again in

459
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,199
malawi what they do is

460
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:16,159
is use a gasifier to gasify

461
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:17,759
the corn cobs and they take that char

462
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,480
and feed it to their chickens and cows

463
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:21,119
and

464
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,240
and wind up with healthy animals with

465
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:24,399
less disease and

466
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,519
increase their milk production a lot of

467
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,038
those kinds of benefits

468
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:30,160
unfortunately in the united united

469
00:17:27,038 --> 00:17:32,798
states we it's illegal to feed

470
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,759
charcoal or biochar of any kind to

471
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:36,160
animals

472
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:38,000
we're trying to change that we have some

473
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,840
feeding trials going on in nebraska to

474
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,519
try to change that

475
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:44,480
but at any rate makes a good feed makes

476
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:48,160
a good soil amendment in an industrial

477
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,960
case you basically use a a reactor which

478
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,440
is

479
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,640
sometimes called a retort typically it's

480
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,279
an auger

481
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:57,038
and you heat the outside of the auger to

482
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:58,240
heat the material you run the material

483
00:17:57,038 --> 00:18:01,279
in the auger

484
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:04,400
takes about 40 minutes to

485
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:04,798
heat the material convert the the solids

486
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,360
to

487
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:08,720
to gas and you burn the off gas often to

488
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:10,159
dry the material that you're putting

489
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,240
into the auger

490
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,600
and then there are larger kilns that are

491
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,000
rotating drums

492
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:18,959
and you feed the material into a

493
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:23,119
rotating drum that looks like a

494
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:26,079
cement mixer long kiln and you use a

495
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:28,399
either the off gas from pyrolysis or you

496
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:31,279
you use an auxiliary gas

497
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:34,240
and you heat the drum you either heat

498
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:36,798
the drum from the outside or you

499
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,319
burn the gas and and put the gas through

500
00:18:36,798 --> 00:18:40,000
the inside of the drum

501
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:42,000
and that again heats the material

502
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,240
converts the solid to a gas and you wind

503
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
up with a char product and the yields in

504
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,960
these different processes

505
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,160
can be something in the order of 20 to

506
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,120
30 percent

507
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,440
of what you start with you wind up with

508
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:56,479
as

509
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:58,558
char and that char contains about 50 of

510
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,759
the energy content that you started with

511
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:03,279
with the biomass

512
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:05,679
so you've converted uh

513
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:07,678
again about 80 of the mass and about 50

514
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:10,400
percent of the energy into a gas

515
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,759
so it's important to be able to recover

516
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:15,038
that gas and use it

517
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:16,798
to make steam

518
00:19:15,038 --> 00:19:18,798
you can generate power except that's

519
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:19,599
expensive but if you can use the steam

520
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:23,038
to

521
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:25,678
heat water for processed water or or

522
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:29,599
our nurse team for processing the

523
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:32,160
material in china for example they

524
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:33,839
provide an incentive to the farmers to

525
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,000
bring their corn stove and their wheat

526
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:38,319
straw to a fertilizer plant

527
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,440
the fertilizer plant converts that

528
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:42,879
stover to

529
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:46,400
char by using the same industrial

530
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:49,919
process of pyrolysis and a rotating drum

531
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:52,960
and then they will use the off gas to

532
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:55,440
heat the stover to

533
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,279
create the biochar and at the same time

534
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,519
they'll use some of the off gas to make

535
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:03,359
steam and that steam then they'll use

536
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:05,839
to treat the char to activate it as it's

537
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:08,479
called which will

538
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:09,678
improve the properties of the char they

539
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,400
add

540
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:14,080
fertilizer components to the char and

541
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,720
then they granulate it and they sell a

542
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:17,918
granulated biochar based fertilizer back

543
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,519
to

544
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,679
the farmer and they're producing about

545
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:23,359
500 000 tons per year now and they

546
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:26,559
expect to get to

547
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:28,639
3 million tons before long uh so

548
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:30,480
they're making a very active industrial

549
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,240
use of biochar in china

550
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,000
by contrast here in the united states

551
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:37,679
we're producing somewhere in the 50

552
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:41,519
to 70 000 tons a year we have about

553
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:42,880
150 biochar producers and suppliers in

554
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:45,038
the united states

555
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,320
and it's slowly growing as people are

556
00:20:45,038 --> 00:20:49,119
discovering

557
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:50,879
the many uses for char uh and and

558
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:53,599
developing markets

559
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,919
and understanding more importantly the

560
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:57,839
uh

561
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:59,440
the needs of their of their customers

562
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:01,119
so you mentioned a few different methods

563
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,360
for making biochar

564
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:04,239
how does the quality of the final

565
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:07,918
product

566
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:10,400
vary from a soil health

567
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:12,000
perspective when you when you talk about

568
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:15,038
gasification versus

569
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,079
pyrolysis for example well if you

570
00:21:15,038 --> 00:21:18,240
control the

571
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:21,119
if you control the factors of production

572
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:24,240
if you control temperature and time

573
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:25,678
then you typically can make a similar

574
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,519
quality of biochar

575
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,600
uh regardless of the process the

576
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:32,158
gasifier chars tend to be

577
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:33,678
slightly higher temperature jars they're

578
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,080
because they're partially oxidized

579
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,480
you've

580
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:40,158
used a little air in the process and so

581
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:42,480
they tend to burn off more of the

582
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:43,440
the tars they're very clean clean jars

583
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,440
the

584
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,038
wood chars from gasification and

585
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,759
combustion work very well

586
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:50,720
for filtration where you're trying to

587
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:54,079
capture

588
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:57,279
heavy metals from storm water

589
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:59,918
they have good surface properties

590
00:21:57,279 --> 00:22:00,399
pyrolysis jars can if you cook them long

591
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,080
enough

592
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,919
have very similar properties but then

593
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:05,279
they also have different

594
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,960
uh some different surface

595
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:09,359
characteristics what are called

596
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,919
functional groups the functional groups

597
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:12,719
have different abilities to attract

598
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:15,840
certain

599
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:18,960
nutrients but in general most chars

600
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:21,839
many chars are very similar for

601
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:24,640
most common uses so if you're using the

602
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:26,720
chars in the soil if you're using char

603
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:29,600
as an additive to organics and

604
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:32,000
co-composting composting them together

605
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:33,038
uh that's a very popular and very

606
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,400
effective use

607
00:22:33,038 --> 00:22:38,480
you use about five or ten percent

608
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,000
biochar by weight or ten to twenty

609
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:43,120
percent by volume

610
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,159
together with organics and you wind up

611
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:47,439
with a biochar based compost

612
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:49,679
in that case you can actually

613
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,679
accommodate a wide variety of

614
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:53,840
qualities of high temperature and low

615
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:55,200
temperature

616
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:57,199
one of the challenges we've had

617
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,120
commercially is that

618
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,400
many of the people who've been producing

619
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:04,000
biochars

620
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:07,360
have not necessarily had

621
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,679
industrial experience and they produce

622
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:11,678
an inconsistent quality of char so it's

623
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,960
not necessarily the fact that their char

624
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:15,280
is good or bad

625
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,400
it's just simply that different batches

626
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:18,000
of char maybe

627
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,720
have different qualities and so the

628
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,919
buyers complain about truckloads

629
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:26,400
having different different qualities

630
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:28,320
if they're going to use the char in a in

631
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,080
a recipe and a soil amendment recipe

632
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:31,918
they want to have

633
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:33,678
at least a consistent product that they

634
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:38,320
can depend on

635
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:40,480
as they add char as a component to

636
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:41,839
two other materials for a soil amendment

637
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,480
for example

638
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:46,798
but there's there's a lot of what we

639
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,278
call a buffering capacity in char and

640
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:49,599
that

641
00:23:47,278 --> 00:23:51,919
there's a certain amount of leeway in

642
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:53,199
quality

643
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:56,080
and you can make some pretty good

644
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:59,440
quality chars people look at the

645
00:23:56,079 --> 00:24:00,879
at the kilns the the pit kiln in its

646
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,320
metal form

647
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,480
took the form of what was called a

648
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:05,278
contiki kiln generally we're calling

649
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,480
those flame

650
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:09,679
cap kilns because that flame that burns

651
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,240
above the pit

652
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:13,759
is providing the heat that's doing the

653
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:17,759
carbonization

654
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:19,278
and that style of making

655
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:21,599
biochar makes actually a very good

656
00:24:19,278 --> 00:24:24,558
quality biochar it's a slightly oxidized

657
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:24,558
gasification char

658
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,960
and but those units the small portable

659
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:32,000
units are more

660
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:34,720
place-based applications where you're

661
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,679
you're making char from uh orchard

662
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,000
prunings or

663
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:40,000
vineyard prunings that sort of thing for

664
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,240
use actually right there in the orchard

665
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,319
and

666
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,599
in the vineyard you're not gonna take

667
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:47,278
the material very far

668
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:50,558
and you you move the uh metal carbonizer

669
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:50,558
or kiln around

670
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:55,679
where biochars are made in a stationary

671
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:57,599
application

672
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:59,278
about the size of today's modern

673
00:24:57,599 --> 00:25:02,079
charcoal plant

674
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:04,000
then you're looking at chars that are

675
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:05,839
being shipped

676
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
pretty good distances to specific

677
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:10,399
applications and in those cases they use

678
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:14,079
more sophisticated processing

679
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:16,960
and very carefully control chart quality

680
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:18,480
for specific uses and often they'll

681
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,000
they'll make what we've been calling

682
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,798
designer chars or

683
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,240
chars that are made for specific

684
00:25:22,798 --> 00:25:25,759
applications

685
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,599
and what's different about those jars

686
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:29,278
typically is that

687
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:31,439
they're carefully controlled for their

688
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:32,319
size and other characteristics so if

689
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,278
they're

690
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:37,359
meant to absorb mercury and metals for

691
00:25:35,278 --> 00:25:39,519
example in filtration applications or

692
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:42,158
remediating soils

693
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:43,038
you might tilt the process a little bit

694
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:46,480
if you've got good

695
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:48,158
control over it to have the chars have

696
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,640
slightly different

697
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:53,039
qualities there's some sort of basic

698
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:56,080
tests for chart quality and that is

699
00:25:53,038 --> 00:25:58,879
if you you want it to be basically clean

700
00:25:56,079 --> 00:26:00,240
and porous and so if you take the jar

701
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,480
and crush it in your hands

702
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,679
you hope that it's it's friable that it

703
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,798
crushes

704
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:08,960
um if you taste the jar you want the

705
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:10,879
or smell it you don't want to smell a

706
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:14,079
lot of

707
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,039
oily tarry products and we want it to

708
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:17,918
smell

709
00:26:15,038 --> 00:26:20,240
pretty clean and if you if you take the

710
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:22,320
char and you

711
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,720
and you put your hands in it you want to

712
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:26,558
be able to wash that char off with water

713
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,240
instead of needing soap to wash it off

714
00:26:26,558 --> 00:26:29,200
and that's an indication that it doesn't

715
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,880
have any

716
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,960
tars and oils in the char and that it's

717
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:36,480
pretty clean uh so those are

718
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:40,400
those are the kind of feel and

719
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:42,240
and and taste uh and and wash tests

720
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,759
that we use just to understand that

721
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,079
you've got

722
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:48,480
a char that's been cooked long enough at

723
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:50,720
an adequate temperature so that it's not

724
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,319
carrying a lot of tars and oils the tars

725
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:55,600
and oils can be recovered

726
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:57,918
uh in a contained device whether you're

727
00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:59,359
heating char in a 50 gallon drum or

728
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:01,038
whether you're putting it through an

729
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:04,079
industrial process

730
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:06,640
you can condense uh three different

731
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:09,678
densities of liquids

732
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:11,440
those gases that are made by heating the

733
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:13,200
char

734
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,278
contain some light we call it wood

735
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:18,840
vinegar or pyro-igneous acids

736
00:27:15,278 --> 00:27:20,079
and those are used sometimes as growth

737
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:21,599
stimulants

738
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:23,439
i understand that you can pay six

739
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:26,558
dollars for a liter of

740
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,640
wood vinegar in japan

741
00:27:26,558 --> 00:27:30,398
use it as a foliar spray and it turns

742
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,840
out that that

743
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:34,158
one of the active ingredients in the

744
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:38,319
foliar spray are actually

745
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:42,000
nano carbons they're very very small

746
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:45,439
size carbon particles that can penetrate

747
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:48,558
the stomata of the leaf

748
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,360
directly kind of main lining biochar if

749
00:27:48,558 --> 00:27:51,759
you will

750
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:53,519
and that within the wood vinegars there

751
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:55,278
are what they call signaling compounds

752
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:57,099
or the smoke smelling smoke-like

753
00:27:55,278 --> 00:27:58,558
compounds that

754
00:27:57,099 --> 00:28:01,599
[Music]

755
00:27:58,558 --> 00:28:04,398
actually act as as as growth stimulants

756
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:06,558
so the wood vinegar can be used as a

757
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:09,678
grow stimulant it can be used

758
00:28:06,558 --> 00:28:10,720
straight as a the tars for example which

759
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:12,559
are heavier

760
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:15,038
can also be condensed and those can be

761
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:17,119
used as a preservative

762
00:28:15,038 --> 00:28:19,759
so in brazil for example they will take

763
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:21,199
the mix of wood tars and vinegars

764
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:23,679
they'll take the tar and they'll dilute

765
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:27,278
it 200 to 1 for use and

766
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:29,038
to as a wood preservative to protect

767
00:28:27,278 --> 00:28:30,079
against termites and they'll use it 2

768
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:32,720
thousand to one

769
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:34,079
uh with water to use as a growth

770
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,319
stimulant

771
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:37,199
but those those products are not widely

772
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:39,119
used

773
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,319
here in the united states we import some

774
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:42,719
wood vinegar

775
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:44,319
products from china i think there's only

776
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,399
about one producer that

777
00:28:44,319 --> 00:28:48,480
has industrial uses for wood vinegar

778
00:28:46,398 --> 00:28:50,319
here here in the united states but

779
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,880
as we look down the road we look to see

780
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:55,200
more of those products being refined and

781
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:57,600
developed and sold here in the united

782
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,600
states

783
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:02,640
yeah now tom you'd mentioned um we

784
00:29:00,398 --> 00:29:04,000
touched on a lot of stuff there uh

785
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:07,200
one thing though that i wanted to go

786
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:10,319
back to was how you evaluate

787
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:13,919
uh a charcoal or biochar

788
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:16,240
and how how would a consumer

789
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:17,840
be able to you know tell the difference

790
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,359
between these different types of burnt

791
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:24,319
products whether it be

792
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:24,319
soot or ash or charcoal

793
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,240
can you can you touch on that a little

794
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:31,359
bit more yeah there's a

795
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:34,720
there's actually a uh um

796
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:38,240
the there there are labeling uh rules

797
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:40,000
about biochars um about

798
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,839
four or five years ago the american

799
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,319
association of plant food control

800
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:46,879
officials which is an association of

801
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:47,759
agricultural departments from each state

802
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:51,760
around the

803
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:55,200
country and in canada and mexico

804
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:57,519
all get together and they decide

805
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:00,159
what constitutes a label for a product

806
00:29:57,519 --> 00:30:02,319
and they decided that biochar

807
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:05,200
to call something biochar on a label it

808
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:09,278
had to have at least 60 percent carbon

809
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:11,278
and so if you buy a product on a shelf

810
00:30:09,278 --> 00:30:13,119
a soil amendment for example that has

811
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:14,398
biochar in it or if you buy a straight

812
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:18,639
biochar

813
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:21,278
it it it should have 60 percent or more

814
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:23,919
carbon in the biochar so that it would

815
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:26,319
have more carbon and less ash

816
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:27,759
the ash are you know natural ash

817
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:31,119
ingredients calcium

818
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:31,440
uh potassium other components that when

819
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:34,959
you

820
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:35,519
cook down the uh cook down the biomass

821
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,960
to

822
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:40,798
to biochar that ash will increase

823
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,480
as a proportion of the total because you

824
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:44,960
you've reduced the amount of

825
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,278
cellulose well some of the chars will

826
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,000
have a high ash component so if you make

827
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:52,159
biochar

828
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:54,558
from the straws or agricultural residues

829
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:56,159
they start out with a higher ash content

830
00:30:54,558 --> 00:30:58,079
so they're going to wind up with less

831
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:00,799
than 60 percent

832
00:30:58,079 --> 00:31:02,639
uh carbon but that doesn't mean they're

833
00:31:00,798 --> 00:31:04,480
bad biochars it just means they have a

834
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:09,440
different balance of ash

835
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:11,839
to carbon and so you need to understand

836
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,360
if a char is coming from an agricultural

837
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:16,319
residue and it doesn't

838
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:18,398
isn't labeled biochar then typically

839
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:19,439
it'll have a slightly higher ash lower

840
00:31:18,398 --> 00:31:22,319
carbon

841
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:24,000
component so then you use it sort of

842
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:25,839
proportionally you use it

843
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,880
maybe in a slightly different way than

844
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:30,398
then you would use a wood ash

845
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,080
it kind of depends on what you want to

846
00:31:30,398 --> 00:31:36,319
do with the biochar if you want

847
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:38,079
biochar to change the texture of a soil

848
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:40,319
or a growing mix

849
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:42,319
then any kind of a soil additive whether

850
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:44,480
it's biochar or whether it's a mineral

851
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:46,639
like a vermiculite or perlite

852
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:49,120
you really need to add about 25 to a

853
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,720
soil mix before you really see a change

854
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:54,719
in texture

855
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:58,079
but if you want it to be a

856
00:31:54,720 --> 00:32:00,640
an aid to water holding capacity

857
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:01,839
that sort of thing then you may only

858
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,480
need to add

859
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:05,599
five percent or ten percent uh biochar

860
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:09,120
to

861
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:11,439
uh to a compost or two a soil amendment

862
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:13,199
so it really depends uh in terms of

863
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:16,640
quality it depends on how you're going

864
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:18,640
to use the chars there are also

865
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:22,159
chars that are made from manures and

866
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:25,360
those only have 10 to 20 percent

867
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:27,760
biochar or 20 10 to 20 percent carbon

868
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:29,199
but they have lots and lots of other

869
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:32,240
beneficial

870
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:34,159
nutrients and

871
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,919
typically not as much nitrogen because

872
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:37,600
nitrogen is cooked off in the process

873
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:40,559
but you'll have

874
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:42,079
potassium and phosphorus and calcium and

875
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:45,440
a lot of other

876
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:49,199
minerals in the mix so

877
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:51,440
in terms of of biochar quality

878
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,200
if you're buying it in a bag it often if

879
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:56,399
it says biochar then it'll

880
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:58,880
have 60 carbon uh some

881
00:32:56,398 --> 00:33:00,479
biochar producers claim that they will

882
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:03,039
have eighty percent carbon

883
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,839
um that's a very high carbon typically

884
00:33:03,038 --> 00:33:08,240
made from a

885
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:10,158
from a wood product uh if

886
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,359
if you're buying a bulk char and you can

887
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:14,559
do that sort of c

888
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:16,959
and field test and uh and

889
00:33:14,558 --> 00:33:19,440
and it passes that sort of wash your

890
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:21,200
hands and feel it and taste it test

891
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:23,278
uh it's gonna be a pretty good quality

892
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:26,798
char that's gonna be in that 60

893
00:33:23,278 --> 00:33:29,200
or better uh uh char range

894
00:33:26,798 --> 00:33:31,278
so you know as a consumer i think what

895
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:33,600
you do like any other

896
00:33:31,278 --> 00:33:34,640
uh for a soil application any other

897
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:38,319
growing media

898
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:40,559
uh you you try it out and and you make

899
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:43,439
sure that you're feeding the uh

900
00:33:40,558 --> 00:33:45,278
the plants sufficiently with enough

901
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,600
nitrogen one of the things to be aware

902
00:33:45,278 --> 00:33:50,079
of

903
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:53,839
is that if you add jar to a growing mix

904
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:57,199
the char will actually preferentially um

905
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:59,519
absorb initially absorb uh

906
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,480
nutrients like nitrogen and so on and so

907
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:02,159
if your plants go

908
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,399
yellow and you wind up being a little

909
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:05,919
chlorotic

910
00:34:04,398 --> 00:34:08,078
if you need to add a little extra

911
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:10,000
fertilizer whether it be an organic

912
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:14,240
fertilizer

913
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:17,280
a feather meal or a nitrogen

914
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:20,398
source of some kind to

915
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:22,720
for the biochar to absorb and not take

916
00:34:20,398 --> 00:34:24,480
it away from the plant

917
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:26,319
and then and that's just really with the

918
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:28,159
initial application after that it

919
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,399
doesn't you haven't lost that nutrient

920
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:33,838
it just simply resides in the char

921
00:34:30,398 --> 00:34:36,159
ultimately the organisms will make that

922
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:37,759
nutrient available to the plant but

923
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:41,760
initially you want to be able to

924
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:43,679
counteract or offset the

925
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,440
nutrient demand of the char itself it

926
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:48,878
just simply will

927
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:50,960
take up a certain amount of nutrient

928
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:53,279
i kind of use the analogy of feeding

929
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:56,240
straw to a beef cow for example it takes

930
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:58,320
about four percent nitrogen just for the

931
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:00,799
to supply enough nitrogen for the animal

932
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,400
to be able to metabolize the straw

933
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,320
and with char it takes a certain amount

934
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,720
of of nutrient just simply to

935
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,320
satisfy the appetite of the char if you

936
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:10,639
will

937
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:12,640
and uh and so it won't take it away from

938
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:14,400
the plant

939
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:16,239
but yeah the quality issue is a

940
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,920
challenge we really as an as an

941
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:21,039
organization as a

942
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:24,480
as a an industry we need to

943
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:25,358
find ways of identifying grades of

944
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,838
biochar

945
00:35:25,358 --> 00:35:30,159
suitable for particular applications and

946
00:35:27,838 --> 00:35:31,440
that's that's really the challenges

947
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:33,199
there are many different qualities of

948
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,720
char that can be used in different ways

949
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:36,319
but it's matching the quality of the

950
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:38,399
chart of the application is really the

951
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,160
key

952
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,000
yeah i do want to highlight that for

953
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:44,960
people because i think it is important

954
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,199
if you're purchasing biochar

955
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,559
that you you do your homework and know

956
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:50,399
what you're buying

957
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:52,078
a good biochar company should be able to

958
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,519
provide you with testing and information

959
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:55,839
about the product that they're producing

960
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:57,920
and it should be consistent

961
00:35:55,838 --> 00:35:59,119
i've seen this problem in some of you

962
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:02,079
know the industries that i'm more

963
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:03,680
involved in in terms of

964
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:06,079
certain people you know putting out

965
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:07,838
product at lower cost that may not be of

966
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:09,519
the same quality and so it's really

967
00:36:07,838 --> 00:36:11,599
important to

968
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:12,960
i think do your due diligence especially

969
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:14,720
with an industry like this that's sort

970
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:17,358
of an emerging technology

971
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:18,399
as people are still learning about it

972
00:36:17,358 --> 00:36:20,480
well the other thing too

973
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:22,240
is simply really has less to do with the

974
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:25,199
biochar than it does

975
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:26,000
to do with the fact that it is a new

976
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:29,199
industry

977
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,719
you get people who have great ideas

978
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:33,358
about biochar they pro

979
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:36,159
over promote the product and then they

980
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:38,400
deliver a product that doesn't

981
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:40,559
doesn't help they don't show the

982
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,720
customer how to use the product

983
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:44,078
appropriately and so things fail and

984
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:46,639
then everybody

985
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:47,440
uh has a bad idea about biochar in

986
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:49,039
general

987
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,960
but it you know it typically takes three

988
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:52,800
to five years to start a business and it

989
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,119
takes three to five years for people to

990
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,839
get

991
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:55,838
used to

992
00:36:56,719 --> 00:36:59,838
generate developing a product that that

993
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,480
is

994
00:36:59,838 --> 00:37:03,519
that is useful and matching the product

995
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:07,199
of the customer and

996
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:09,440
and so i can always tell when a biochar

997
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:12,000
producer calls i can typically tell

998
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:13,519
whether that producer is has gotten to

999
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,440
the point where they really understand

1000
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:18,880
the needs of the uh

1001
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,599
of the customer yeah i mean we've been

1002
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,720
using

1003
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:25,280
biochar now oh boy

1004
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:26,399
i want to say close to a decade my

1005
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,920
father

1006
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,440
you know was got really as you already

1007
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:31,039
know i'm just sharing this for listeners

1008
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,838
got really involved with the contiki

1009
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:34,079
kiln

1010
00:37:31,838 --> 00:37:36,159
we have a contiki kiln that we use

1011
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:39,680
fairly regularly

1012
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:41,279
to burn material and then

1013
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:42,960
we've been working with black owl

1014
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:45,359
biochar

1015
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:48,240
as the product source for us and our

1016
00:37:45,358 --> 00:37:51,279
soils and we've seen wonderful results

1017
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:53,118
i've seen on average you know across a

1018
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,560
variety of different growers you know

1019
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:56,400
somewhere around the range of like eight

1020
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:58,719
to ten percent better

1021
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,838
plant growth and yield with the addition

1022
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:02,959
of biochar

1023
00:37:59,838 --> 00:38:02,960
uh in the in the mix

1024
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:07,599
well and one of the one of the nice

1025
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:08,480
things about the black owl biochar is

1026
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:11,838
that

1027
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:15,519
they the producer is a

1028
00:38:11,838 --> 00:38:18,000
a user producer and that she was growing

1029
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:20,159
organic vegetables when she discovered

1030
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
biochar and growing peonies

1031
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:26,078
and it was a result of her doing some

1032
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:28,639
testing of adding biochar 2

1033
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:30,160
to her favorite growing mix with peonies

1034
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:31,920
that

1035
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:34,480
got her excited about biochar because

1036
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:36,159
she saw the the positive benefits and

1037
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:39,440
then got into the business of

1038
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:40,399
producing it so her criteria for biochar

1039
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,800
quality

1040
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,599
comes from the point of view of of a

1041
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,960
consumer

1042
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:50,480
you know a user and similarly

1043
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:52,400
other companies that have incorporated

1044
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,079
biochar into their product

1045
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,760
like kellogg garden for example in

1046
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:56,320
california they have about a thousand

1047
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,680
outlets

1048
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:00,079
outlets they're a pretty good sized

1049
00:38:57,679 --> 00:39:03,358
company that's been in business since

1050
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:04,800
since the 1930s they spent about four or

1051
00:39:03,358 --> 00:39:07,039
five years

1052
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,160
experimenting with biochar before they

1053
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:10,800
decided to

1054
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:13,199
incorporate biochar into a product with

1055
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:15,680
their label on it because they

1056
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:16,879
needed to to protect the integrity of as

1057
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:20,960
well of their label

1058
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:22,640
and uh they've been very happy with the

1059
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:25,358
with the products they make they make a

1060
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:29,199
couple of biochar amended products

1061
00:39:25,358 --> 00:39:32,400
uh there are other some organic products

1062
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:34,559
one called sustain that has taken their

1063
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:37,920
basic organic

1064
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:41,279
fertilizer and added biochar to it and

1065
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:43,519
their customers are very happy so

1066
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:45,200
again the there are some quality

1067
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:48,559
producers

1068
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:51,358
and at the other end of the spectrum

1069
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:51,358
there are people that

1070
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:54,719
put together what they think is a

1071
00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:55,358
quality material that may have worked

1072
00:39:54,719 --> 00:39:57,039
with the

1073
00:39:55,358 --> 00:39:58,799
with in their own soils in their own

1074
00:39:57,039 --> 00:40:00,559
garden but when they put it out and sell

1075
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,160
it to the general public

1076
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:04,960
they may or may not be very good about

1077
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:08,559
explaining how it should be used and

1078
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:10,639
in what soils and circumstances

1079
00:40:08,559 --> 00:40:12,880
so can you talk a little bit and talk

1080
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:14,960
about why biochar is so important from

1081
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:17,039
an environmental perspective i mean when

1082
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:20,000
i hear the idea of burning wood

1083
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:21,759
for the sake of improving my soil on the

1084
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,480
surface that sounds like a really

1085
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,240
negative

1086
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:26,000
environmental experience can you talk

1087
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:29,279
about why

1088
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:31,599
it's important and beneficial

1089
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:33,440
well the carbon in making biochar you're

1090
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:38,000
converting the carbon

1091
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:39,599
uh that has been developed through

1092
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,199
pulled out of the atmosphere through

1093
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:44,880
photosynthesis

1094
00:40:41,199 --> 00:40:47,199
and you're converting it to a form that

1095
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,800
can be as they say recalcitrant it'll

1096
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:49,358
stay in the soil for a long time so

1097
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,839
you're really

1098
00:40:49,358 --> 00:40:54,480
you're really removing carbon from the

1099
00:40:51,838 --> 00:40:55,920
atmosphere and you're

1100
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,920
putting it into a form where you can put

1101
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,519
it in the soil and it will stay on the

1102
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:02,639
soil and not only that

1103
00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:06,079
the the biochar will will

1104
00:41:02,639 --> 00:41:09,118
catalyze the uh

1105
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:10,880
the whole biological process so i always

1106
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:13,119
like to say that the magic of biochar is

1107
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:16,240
biology you're really

1108
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:17,039
stimulating the biology by providing by

1109
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:20,959
improving

1110
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:24,159
the ability of the plants so on to

1111
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:25,679
uh to photosynthesize

1112
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:28,399
uh carbon and remove it from the

1113
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:30,639
atmosphere and cycle it through the

1114
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,559
through the soil and at the same time

1115
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:34,559
you're taking a renewable source of

1116
00:41:32,559 --> 00:41:37,920
energy

1117
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:39,679
and you're you're converting it either

1118
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:42,318
to energy or to chemicals

1119
00:41:39,679 --> 00:41:44,239
and there's a great deal of research

1120
00:41:42,318 --> 00:41:47,599
there are

1121
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:50,639
about 3 000 peer-reviewed

1122
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:52,000
academic papers a year on uh

1123
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:53,759
the use of biochar in different

1124
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,440
applications and about half of those are

1125
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:58,319
devoted to

1126
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:59,920
uh improving the conversion processes of

1127
00:41:58,318 --> 00:42:02,159
making biochar

1128
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:03,119
and recovering more and more carbon so

1129
00:42:02,159 --> 00:42:05,920
typically in

1130
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:08,079
in a contiki kiln which really is an

1131
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:10,639
engineered pit kiln

1132
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:11,280
you're recovering about 50 to 60 of the

1133
00:42:10,639 --> 00:42:13,039
carbon

1134
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,200
that it was in the plant to start with

1135
00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:17,679
and what we're finding now

1136
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:19,759
is is ways to recover even more of that

1137
00:42:17,679 --> 00:42:21,679
carbon and put it into forms

1138
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:23,760
that are recalcitrant that won't break

1139
00:42:21,679 --> 00:42:27,279
down for thousands of years

1140
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:29,119
and that was one of the exciting things

1141
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,319
to soil scientists a hundred years ago

1142
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:32,880
when they discovered the

1143
00:42:30,318 --> 00:42:34,400
tariff rate in the amazon and also the

1144
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:37,440
biochar that's been used

1145
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:40,000
in man-made or anthropogenic soils

1146
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:41,280
and seven or eight hundred locations

1147
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,519
around the world

1148
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:45,119
and that is here you could put carbon

1149
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:46,000
into a form that was going to last in

1150
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:48,480
the soil for

1151
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,559
literally thousands of years so it's

1152
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:52,400
carbon removal

1153
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:55,199
we've seen the first sale of carbon

1154
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,880
credits for using biochar

1155
00:42:55,199 --> 00:42:58,799
from a producer here in the united

1156
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,280
states selling on a in the european

1157
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,318
market

1158
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:04,800
volunteer market and we see other

1159
00:43:02,318 --> 00:43:05,759
methodologies and other markets evolving

1160
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,720
for trading

1161
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:09,599
biochar on the carbon market and that's

1162
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:11,358
because it's got

1163
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:13,200
a value of removing carbon from the

1164
00:43:11,358 --> 00:43:17,039
atmosphere so there's

1165
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:20,239
that um that carbon side

1166
00:43:17,039 --> 00:43:23,920
and then in addition to that there's the

1167
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:27,439
biological side and as evidence of

1168
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:29,519
the the the nexus of the two of the

1169
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:31,440
carbon and the biology

1170
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:33,039
where they've been doing trials where

1171
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:36,720
they've been looking at

1172
00:43:33,039 --> 00:43:38,239
the degree to which carbon is removed

1173
00:43:36,719 --> 00:43:39,439
from the atmosphere where they've used

1174
00:43:38,239 --> 00:43:41,598
biochar

1175
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,559
over a 10-year period they find that the

1176
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:44,480
far more

1177
00:43:42,559 --> 00:43:45,838
carbon is actually accumulated in the

1178
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:48,639
soil

1179
00:43:45,838 --> 00:43:50,078
than just the amount that accounts for

1180
00:43:48,639 --> 00:43:52,559
the biochar

1181
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:53,359
so there's typically 10 percent or more

1182
00:43:52,559 --> 00:43:56,318
increase

1183
00:43:53,358 --> 00:43:57,199
in carbon sequestration from having used

1184
00:43:56,318 --> 00:44:00,719
biochar

1185
00:43:57,199 --> 00:44:03,199
to stimulate the the

1186
00:44:00,719 --> 00:44:05,519
biology and and truly regenerative

1187
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:08,639
agriculture

1188
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:10,079
so we get uh we get some real benefits

1189
00:44:08,639 --> 00:44:12,239
the challenge with biochar part of the

1190
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:14,160
challenge with biochar today is simply

1191
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:15,679
the cost of making it when you're making

1192
00:44:14,159 --> 00:44:18,799
it in a

1193
00:44:15,679 --> 00:44:21,039
uh in the smallholder situation in

1194
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:22,000
thousands of smallholders in asia and

1195
00:44:21,039 --> 00:44:26,159
africa

1196
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:27,679
and south america have been using

1197
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:30,078
biochar

1198
00:44:27,679 --> 00:44:31,440
as a soil amendment and there they make

1199
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:35,359
it in very

1200
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:38,880
simple kilns and they

1201
00:44:35,358 --> 00:44:41,039
use their own labor so they don't have a

1202
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:44,960
lot of capital invested

1203
00:44:41,039 --> 00:44:48,079
and they can benefit from its uh

1204
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:49,838
its attributes pretty directly in

1205
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:50,640
developed countries in europe the united

1206
00:44:49,838 --> 00:44:53,920
states it's

1207
00:44:50,639 --> 00:44:55,358
growing more slowly as a as a material

1208
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:57,440
simply because

1209
00:44:55,358 --> 00:44:58,880
we do things in an industrial process

1210
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:01,358
that requires labor

1211
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:03,039
and more expensive inputs in terms of

1212
00:45:01,358 --> 00:45:04,559
electricity and so on

1213
00:45:03,039 --> 00:45:07,119
and so the biochar becomes fairly

1214
00:45:04,559 --> 00:45:09,920
expensive so

1215
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:11,838
we're looking forward to those carbon

1216
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:15,119
markets helping to offset the cost of

1217
00:45:11,838 --> 00:45:17,519
biochar so it can be less expensive to

1218
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:18,240
our agriculture and on the carbon side

1219
00:45:17,519 --> 00:45:21,039
we're also

1220
00:45:18,239 --> 00:45:21,759
seeing products that are incorporating

1221
00:45:21,039 --> 00:45:23,759
biochar

1222
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:26,160
into building materials where it will

1223
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,880
also last for a very long period of time

1224
00:45:26,159 --> 00:45:28,879
so

1225
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,000
it's being incorporated into cement and

1226
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:33,358
asphalt being

1227
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,800
incorporated into plastics a number of

1228
00:45:33,358 --> 00:45:38,159
different

1229
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:42,318
combinations that liquid portion

1230
00:45:38,159 --> 00:45:45,039
is being polymerized into

1231
00:45:42,318 --> 00:45:46,239
you might call up natural plastic like

1232
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:48,480
materials

1233
00:45:46,239 --> 00:45:50,559
which will last for a very long time so

1234
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:53,920
we get this carbon benefit as well as

1235
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:56,799
getting this agronomic benefit

1236
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:57,280
and the biology oh that's great i didn't

1237
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,039
even

1238
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:00,400
know about the building materials side

1239
00:45:59,039 --> 00:46:03,279
either that's really interesting

1240
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:04,400
i've been focused on the agriculture

1241
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:06,480
uses

1242
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:09,280
a couple other things i want to touch on

1243
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:11,199
that that you you kind of uh

1244
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:12,800
you kind of danced around too was this

1245
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:13,919
idea that it'll help fight global

1246
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,680
warming

1247
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:18,079
it's improving our soil fertility which

1248
00:46:15,679 --> 00:46:20,159
you talked about

1249
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:23,119
and then the thing that my my father was

1250
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:26,799
most interested in is this idea of

1251
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:29,760
reducing agricultural waste and also

1252
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:30,318
forestry waste where we could take the

1253
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,240
you know

1254
00:46:30,318 --> 00:46:33,838
when when the logging occurs they can

1255
00:46:32,239 --> 00:46:34,639
come back in and grab some of that i

1256
00:46:33,838 --> 00:46:38,318
believe it's just

1257
00:46:34,639 --> 00:46:39,199
called slash material and burn that to

1258
00:46:38,318 --> 00:46:41,599
reduce

1259
00:46:39,199 --> 00:46:43,199
the risk of forest fires while also

1260
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:44,640
sequestering the carbon that can then be

1261
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:48,799
applied back onto those

1262
00:46:44,639 --> 00:46:52,480
lands or potentially sold as a byproduct

1263
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:54,720
to you know an agricultural source

1264
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:56,480
yeah our principal supporter for the u.s

1265
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:58,399
biochar initiative is actually the u.s

1266
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,960
forest service they're quite interested

1267
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,680
as you know the wildfire hazard is quite

1268
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:05,358
large

1269
00:47:01,679 --> 00:47:06,559
we had 57 000 wildfires last year in the

1270
00:47:05,358 --> 00:47:09,920
united states

1271
00:47:06,559 --> 00:47:11,920
covering 10.3 million acres uh the year

1272
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:15,358
before that we had about 43

1273
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:16,720
000 fires covering about four and a half

1274
00:47:15,358 --> 00:47:17,440
million acres and i think the year

1275
00:47:16,719 --> 00:47:21,039
before

1276
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:23,760
that we had about uh in the 50

1277
00:47:21,039 --> 00:47:25,039
000 fires again covering about eight and

1278
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,720
a half million acres and

1279
00:47:25,039 --> 00:47:28,318
according to the insurance folks there

1280
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:32,239
are four million homes that are

1281
00:47:28,318 --> 00:47:34,318
uh in uh in danger from

1282
00:47:32,239 --> 00:47:35,838
from wildfires and of course it varies

1283
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:37,599
from state to state

1284
00:47:35,838 --> 00:47:40,159
uh but pretty much across the country

1285
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:42,640
there there are uh

1286
00:47:40,159 --> 00:47:43,199
serious problems with wildfire and so

1287
00:47:42,639 --> 00:47:45,358
the

1288
00:47:43,199 --> 00:47:46,960
from the forest residues and so it's the

1289
00:47:45,358 --> 00:47:48,799
buildup of not only the

1290
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:51,760
forest residues that are left from

1291
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:52,960
logging but also simply the buildup of

1292
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:56,079
poorly managed

1293
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:59,679
forests we have this great

1294
00:47:56,079 --> 00:48:00,000
collection of forest fuels which causes

1295
00:47:59,679 --> 00:48:01,838
the

1296
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,280
the wildfires so the forest service has

1297
00:48:01,838 --> 00:48:04,719
been interested in the conversion of

1298
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:07,519
these lower value

1299
00:48:04,719 --> 00:48:09,519
materials which can't be converted into

1300
00:48:07,519 --> 00:48:09,920
solid wood products for building and so

1301
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:14,079
on

1302
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:15,680
into into biochar and biochar for use in

1303
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:18,640
applications to improve

1304
00:48:15,679 --> 00:48:20,239
forest health so biochar is a great

1305
00:48:18,639 --> 00:48:22,719
filtration media

1306
00:48:20,239 --> 00:48:24,159
for cleaning up waterways and in our

1307
00:48:22,719 --> 00:48:25,358
natural forests we have about three

1308
00:48:24,159 --> 00:48:28,399
hundred thousand

1309
00:48:25,358 --> 00:48:30,400
abandoned farm uh mine lands that are

1310
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:32,400
leaching chemicals into waterways

1311
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:33,519
and by taking some of these forest

1312
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:35,760
residues

1313
00:48:33,519 --> 00:48:37,759
converting them to biochar we can

1314
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:41,040
actually filter

1315
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:41,040
and permanently tie up

1316
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:44,559
those minerals that cause problems

1317
00:48:43,199 --> 00:48:46,480
there's

1318
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:47,839
restoration work going on in places like

1319
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,960
colorado and so on that have

1320
00:48:47,838 --> 00:48:51,599
demonstrated this

1321
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:52,639
and here in oregon in southern oregon at

1322
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:54,240
a nickel mine

1323
00:48:52,639 --> 00:48:56,480
various other mines so we're working

1324
00:48:54,239 --> 00:48:59,759
with a forest service looking at

1325
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:00,159
at locations where biochars can be used

1326
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:02,240
for

1327
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:03,838
improving rangeland for example they

1328
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:06,959
found in the rockies they

1329
00:49:03,838 --> 00:49:07,838
found that by adding biochar to grazing

1330
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:11,039
land they can

1331
00:49:07,838 --> 00:49:12,639
improve and increase the water retention

1332
00:49:11,039 --> 00:49:16,159
in grazing land so they can actually get

1333
00:49:12,639 --> 00:49:19,279
an additional month of grazing

1334
00:49:16,159 --> 00:49:21,199
by adding biochar to the to the grazing

1335
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:24,240
land in the forest

1336
00:49:21,199 --> 00:49:27,279
we also have of course the crop residues

1337
00:49:24,239 --> 00:49:28,318
here in oregon we export about 700 000

1338
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:31,040
tons

1339
00:49:28,318 --> 00:49:31,440
of our straw from our grass seed harvest

1340
00:49:31,039 --> 00:49:34,480
to

1341
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:36,800
japan and korea and taiwan for as a feed

1342
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:38,960
supplement as a dairy feed supplement

1343
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:41,359
but that's more difficult with straw

1344
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:43,519
residues like in eastern washington

1345
00:49:41,358 --> 00:49:45,759
where you have wheat straw that has a

1346
00:49:43,519 --> 00:49:47,599
different texture and application we

1347
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:49,520
find we've finally seen in

1348
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:50,640
eastern washington now there's a paper

1349
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:52,639
mill

1350
00:49:50,639 --> 00:49:53,759
that will be that's making paper from

1351
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:55,199
wheat straw

1352
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:57,680
there hasn't been a market for that for

1353
00:49:55,199 --> 00:50:00,719
the last 30 years 40 years ago we were

1354
00:49:57,679 --> 00:50:02,318
we did have paper mills that were making

1355
00:50:00,719 --> 00:50:04,879
paper from straw but we've been

1356
00:50:02,318 --> 00:50:08,400
importing wood from around the globe

1357
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:10,318
at a very low cost and so that hasn't

1358
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:12,480
been an option well there are also crop

1359
00:50:10,318 --> 00:50:13,119
residues and processing residues like

1360
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:15,920
manures

1361
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:17,440
anaerobic digestion the digestate from

1362
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:19,358
anaerobic digestion that can be

1363
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:22,559
converted to

1364
00:50:19,358 --> 00:50:26,000
to biochars and so

1365
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:28,079
the combination if you look at the u.s

1366
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,000
we have supposedly according to the

1367
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:30,640
department of energy about a billion

1368
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,838
tons

1369
00:50:30,639 --> 00:50:35,440
of both residues and potential energy

1370
00:50:33,838 --> 00:50:37,920
crops of various kinds it could be

1371
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:41,280
converted to

1372
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:44,240
fuel and other chemical products and

1373
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:46,640
and byproducts and biochar can be a

1374
00:50:44,239 --> 00:50:49,598
co-product of some of that processing so

1375
00:50:46,639 --> 00:50:52,318
potentially we could make biochar as a

1376
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:54,160
co-product there's a plant in oregon

1377
00:50:52,318 --> 00:50:57,599
that we'll be making in lakeview that

1378
00:50:54,159 --> 00:51:00,639
will be making jet fuel from uh

1379
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:04,960
wood and one of the co-products will be

1380
00:51:00,639 --> 00:51:07,440
will be biochar so here we can

1381
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:08,000
help work on our improve the increased

1382
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:10,559
renewable

1383
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,920
energy at the same time find a home for

1384
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:14,480
the

1385
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:15,119
some of these residues and some of the

1386
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:18,800
parts of the

1387
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:20,800
residues that can't otherwise be used uh

1388
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:22,318
heavily barky residues or some of the

1389
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:25,359
crop residues

1390
00:51:22,318 --> 00:51:26,480
and and manures and waste and so on by

1391
00:51:25,358 --> 00:51:30,480
converting them to

1392
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:33,679
uh to energy and biochar

1393
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:35,039
that's that's really interesting

1394
00:51:33,679 --> 00:51:37,279
i look forward to following up with you

1395
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:37,838
about uh about this jet fuel option and

1396
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,359
the

1397
00:51:37,838 --> 00:51:41,519
biochar that's coming out of that that's

1398
00:51:39,358 --> 00:51:45,679
wonderful to hear about more renewable

1399
00:51:41,519 --> 00:51:47,519
energy sources um just to uh

1400
00:51:45,679 --> 00:51:50,000
tie everything back together though i

1401
00:51:47,519 --> 00:51:53,039
wanted to ask you so

1402
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,159
we talked about you know from a user

1403
00:51:53,039 --> 00:51:57,440
perspective

1404
00:51:54,159 --> 00:51:59,598
uh growing plants and talk in regards to

1405
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:01,838
soil health and that use for biochar

1406
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:02,720
if we start you know for example in our

1407
00:52:01,838 --> 00:52:05,838
soils

1408
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:06,558
when i talk about uh making soilless

1409
00:52:05,838 --> 00:52:08,318
media

1410
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:10,079
essentially we're at five to eight

1411
00:52:08,318 --> 00:52:12,159
percent of by volume

1412
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:15,280
of our total mix you mentioned people

1413
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:17,118
using biochars up to 25

1414
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:18,800
and and considering it more as a portion

1415
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:20,640
of your aeration

1416
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:22,400
essentially in your soil so using it to

1417
00:52:20,639 --> 00:52:24,400
control you know gas exchange air

1418
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:25,838
exchange

1419
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:27,119
there are some properties of biochar

1420
00:52:25,838 --> 00:52:28,558
that i think we should touch on which is

1421
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:31,119
the fact like you mentioned it has a

1422
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:34,240
very high cation exchange capacity

1423
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:35,358
it tends to be alkaline which raises

1424
00:52:34,239 --> 00:52:37,838
your ph

1425
00:52:35,358 --> 00:52:38,799
how are these things sort of accounted

1426
00:52:37,838 --> 00:52:42,400
for

1427
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:44,880
on a practical level when combined into

1428
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,880
a soil

1429
00:52:45,039 --> 00:52:52,558
well to start with most of the biochars

1430
00:52:48,159 --> 00:52:54,000
are analyzed the system of analysis was

1431
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:55,119
developed by the international biochar

1432
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,480
initiative and there are certain

1433
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:58,400
laboratories like

1434
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:00,079
control laboratories in california that

1435
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:01,200
follow the international biochar

1436
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:02,800
initiative

1437
00:53:01,199 --> 00:53:04,399
protocols we're identifying other

1438
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:07,440
laboratories around the country that

1439
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:09,119
are capable of analyzing biochars

1440
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:10,639
and so you do you do get numbers or

1441
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:12,838
reference numbers you can use

1442
00:53:10,639 --> 00:53:14,639
on alkalinity on cat ion exchange

1443
00:53:12,838 --> 00:53:17,279
capacity we have a tool on the

1444
00:53:14,639 --> 00:53:19,118
international biochar initiative website

1445
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:21,519
where you can plug in the properties of

1446
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:25,119
your biochar and it will suggest

1447
00:53:21,519 --> 00:53:27,199
uses is as a soil additive or as a

1448
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:32,000
growing media looks at particle size

1449
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:34,480
all the different characteristics the

1450
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:36,318
as as part of a grow as far as growing

1451
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:38,000
media is concerned for example in one

1452
00:53:36,318 --> 00:53:39,759
case

1453
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,519
we looked at biochar as a co-product

1454
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:44,480
from gasification for use

1455
00:53:41,519 --> 00:53:46,318
in a nursery growing tree seedlings and

1456
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:47,838
the nursery was using

1457
00:53:46,318 --> 00:53:49,679
typical what used to be called the

1458
00:53:47,838 --> 00:53:53,920
cornell mix which was

1459
00:53:49,679 --> 00:53:57,598
50 percent bark because bark is cheap 25

1460
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:59,920
vermiculite and 25 percent peat

1461
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:00,800
and so we started substituting we did

1462
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:02,720
some

1463
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:04,960
tests substituting different levels of

1464
00:54:02,719 --> 00:54:07,439
biochar from the gasifier

1465
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:09,519
uh substituting the biochar for the

1466
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:12,500
vermiculite looking primarily

1467
00:54:09,519 --> 00:54:13,679
at at replacing the

1468
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:15,679
[Music]

1469
00:54:13,679 --> 00:54:17,199
sort of physical properties of

1470
00:54:15,679 --> 00:54:19,519
vermiculite with

1471
00:54:17,199 --> 00:54:20,799
biochar and we found that we could add

1472
00:54:19,519 --> 00:54:24,559
up to 25

1473
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:25,519
biochar until we ran into the situation

1474
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:28,880
where

1475
00:54:25,519 --> 00:54:30,880
uh because of the um we instead of using

1476
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:32,160
peat we were using compost as a peat

1477
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:34,880
substitute

1478
00:54:32,159 --> 00:54:35,519
the compost happened to be uh alkaline

1479
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:37,200
and so

1480
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:38,798
we ran into an issue with one of the

1481
00:54:37,199 --> 00:54:40,239
tree i think it was sugar pine one of

1482
00:54:38,798 --> 00:54:41,679
the tree species

1483
00:54:40,239 --> 00:54:43,759
one of the fun parts about doing

1484
00:54:41,679 --> 00:54:45,358
experiments in a tree industry is you've

1485
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:46,880
got hundreds of thousands of trees to

1486
00:54:45,358 --> 00:54:48,558
look at in the

1487
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:49,920
in the greenhouse as you look across and

1488
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:51,680
you can tell whether

1489
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:54,000
a species has a particular problem or

1490
00:54:51,679 --> 00:54:55,199
not uh but we were able to

1491
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,000
actually go to high rates of

1492
00:54:55,199 --> 00:55:00,879
substitution with the biochar

1493
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:02,719
again relying primarily on the physical

1494
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:04,720
characteristics of the biochar

1495
00:55:02,719 --> 00:55:06,078
but in that case you've got fertigation

1496
00:55:04,719 --> 00:55:08,480
so you're actually supplying

1497
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:09,519
the fertilizer and so on to the tree

1498
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:12,159
seedlings

1499
00:55:09,519 --> 00:55:12,639
and you're not depending on you know

1500
00:55:12,159 --> 00:55:15,358
other

1501
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:17,199
attributes of the biochar but typically

1502
00:55:15,358 --> 00:55:19,279
it's interesting because

1503
00:55:17,199 --> 00:55:21,199
five percent keeps coming up again and

1504
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:24,240
again as

1505
00:55:21,199 --> 00:55:24,798
sort of the best uh between five and ten

1506
00:55:24,239 --> 00:55:27,679
percent

1507
00:55:24,798 --> 00:55:28,400
sort of the best rate of application of

1508
00:55:27,679 --> 00:55:30,798
biochar

1509
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:32,079
to regardless of whether it's an organic

1510
00:55:30,798 --> 00:55:35,599
media or soil

1511
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:38,720
soil mix and uh

1512
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:39,280
that seems to be a a level where you get

1513
00:55:38,719 --> 00:55:42,798
the best

1514
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:45,680
benefit that's interesting

1515
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:46,838
yeah now relating to this tree trial you

1516
00:55:45,679 --> 00:55:49,838
did did you

1517
00:55:46,838 --> 00:55:52,960
see um

1518
00:55:49,838 --> 00:55:55,199
did you see other issues associated

1519
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:57,039
with the high rates of biocharge besides

1520
00:55:55,199 --> 00:55:57,919
just alkalinity did you have to treat it

1521
00:55:57,039 --> 00:56:02,318
for

1522
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:04,880
with some nitrogen prior to adding it in

1523
00:56:02,318 --> 00:56:06,880
so it didn't cause plants yellowing and

1524
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:09,599
nitrogen robbing

1525
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:12,079
well again in that case with the

1526
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:15,119
seedlings you've got a

1527
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:17,280
fertilizing fertigation type

1528
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:19,599
situation where you're you're constantly

1529
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:22,798
adjusting and balancing

1530
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:24,400
nutrient levels so we probably did

1531
00:56:22,798 --> 00:56:27,838
increase

1532
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:31,200
increased nitrogen initially to

1533
00:56:27,838 --> 00:56:33,838
balance the effect of the biochar

1534
00:56:31,199 --> 00:56:35,519
especially at those very high rates uh

1535
00:56:33,838 --> 00:56:37,759
and in other words the

1536
00:56:35,519 --> 00:56:39,199
the high rates to give you an example

1537
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:41,440
there's a composting operation in

1538
00:56:39,199 --> 00:56:43,519
missouri that's using a lot of biochar

1539
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:45,200
because the more biochar they use

1540
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:47,519
the more food waste they can take in

1541
00:56:45,199 --> 00:56:50,000
well food waste has much higher nitrogen

1542
00:56:47,519 --> 00:56:50,000
and higher

1543
00:56:50,318 --> 00:56:55,279
nutrients than their typical organics

1544
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:56,559
and the composting process

1545
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:59,440
but what's interesting and they'll

1546
00:56:56,559 --> 00:57:01,040
openly talk about this is that the more

1547
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:03,119
biochar they use the more food waste

1548
00:57:01,039 --> 00:57:04,400
they can use the food waste has a higher

1549
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:05,440
tipping fee so that helps their

1550
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:07,838
economics

1551
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:08,798
they wind up making a richer compost

1552
00:57:07,838 --> 00:57:11,039
that they actually

1553
00:57:08,798 --> 00:57:12,719
charge twice as much for compared with

1554
00:57:11,039 --> 00:57:16,000
their regular compost

1555
00:57:12,719 --> 00:57:20,239
so by using but they wind up with

1556
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:23,280
uh after composting they wind up with uh

1557
00:57:20,239 --> 00:57:25,838
they advertise 16 biochar by

1558
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:27,920
volume so that's about eight percent

1559
00:57:25,838 --> 00:57:30,480
biochar by weight so you're still back

1560
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:33,838
in that five to ten percent range

1561
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:34,318
and uh that that seems to be sort of a

1562
00:57:33,838 --> 00:57:37,199
magic

1563
00:57:34,318 --> 00:57:38,079
range and it not only just seems to be a

1564
00:57:37,199 --> 00:57:40,078
magic range

1565
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:42,160
it's been very well documented and

1566
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:45,920
tested in multi-year

1567
00:57:42,159 --> 00:57:49,358
trials and and research in europe and

1568
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:49,358
and here in the united states

1569
00:57:49,838 --> 00:57:53,759
so last question for someone who's

1570
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,519
really interested in learning more

1571
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:56,640
passionate about biochar

1572
00:57:55,519 --> 00:57:58,639
can you talk a little bit about how

1573
00:57:56,639 --> 00:58:02,798
someone might get involved with

1574
00:57:58,639 --> 00:58:05,118
the international biocharge initiative

1575
00:58:02,798 --> 00:58:06,719
or ibi yeah we have we have two

1576
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:08,000
organizations we have the international

1577
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:10,639
biochar initiative and we

1578
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:12,079
also have the u.s biochar initiative the

1579
00:58:10,639 --> 00:58:14,558
international biochar initiative was

1580
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:16,960
created back in 2007

1581
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:19,040
with the idea of developing standards

1582
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:23,358
and practices for the use of biochar

1583
00:58:19,039 --> 00:58:26,400
for carbon trading in 2010 we created

1584
00:58:23,358 --> 00:58:28,078
the u.s biochar initiative

1585
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:29,838
with the idea of focusing primarily on

1586
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:32,480
the needs for

1587
00:58:29,838 --> 00:58:33,599
the use of biochar in north america so

1588
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:38,159
you can go to

1589
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:40,160
biochar hyphen international.org

1590
00:58:38,159 --> 00:58:42,000
for the international biochar initiative

1591
00:58:40,159 --> 00:58:42,960
or just google international biochar

1592
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:46,318
initiative

1593
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:49,519
or the u.s biochar initiative is biochar

1594
00:58:46,318 --> 00:58:52,719
hyphen us.org

1595
00:58:49,519 --> 00:58:56,559
for the u.s biochar initiative we have

1596
00:58:52,719 --> 00:59:00,558
a youtube channel with about 60 videos

1597
00:58:56,559 --> 00:59:02,480
that we put together last december

1598
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:04,559
and what we call the national biochar

1599
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:06,960
week we've held about

1600
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:09,119
seven or seven conferences and one

1601
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:11,599
virtual conference

1602
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:13,200
we have a monthly newsletter the u.s

1603
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:14,640
biochar initiative does

1604
00:59:13,199 --> 00:59:16,239
you can sign up for the newsletter on

1605
00:59:14,639 --> 00:59:18,400
our on our website

1606
00:59:16,239 --> 00:59:19,598
we're basically a volunteer organization

1607
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:22,639
uh we rely on

1608
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:23,599
donations and grants from forest service

1609
00:59:22,639 --> 00:59:26,719
and other sources

1610
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:28,318
for promoting the use of of biochar we

1611
00:59:26,719 --> 00:59:30,318
work very closely with the international

1612
00:59:28,318 --> 00:59:33,599
biochar initiative and so we

1613
00:59:30,318 --> 00:59:36,318
we actually uh work in an

1614
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:38,559
international community if you will a

1615
00:59:36,318 --> 00:59:42,400
very active biochar community in

1616
00:59:38,559 --> 00:59:45,280
in australia and in europe and china

1617
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:46,000
and in latin america connecting all

1618
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:47,359
these folks i

1619
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,039
chaired the international biochar

1620
00:59:47,358 --> 00:59:51,119
initiative for about four years and for

1621
00:59:49,039 --> 00:59:56,318
the last five years i've shared the

1622
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:58,798
us biochar initiative so uh we're slowly

1623
00:59:56,318 --> 01:00:01,039
uh our biggest challenge is educating

1624
00:59:58,798 --> 01:00:01,599
folks we also have a biochar discussion

1625
01:00:01,039 --> 01:00:05,279
group

1626
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:06,880
at biochar groups dot io

1627
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:09,359
and that's a discussion list that i've

1628
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:11,280
hosted since 2006 we have about a

1629
01:00:09,358 --> 01:00:14,318
thousand people online and some very

1630
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:16,720
knowledgeable and experienced people

1631
01:00:14,318 --> 01:00:18,880
in biochar and the challenge with those

1632
01:00:16,719 --> 01:00:21,439
listservs or discussion lists

1633
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:22,160
is always you have to ask the question

1634
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:24,159
to get an

1635
01:00:22,159 --> 01:00:26,798
answer and sometimes you'll get answers

1636
01:00:24,159 --> 01:00:28,239
from armchair experts who really don't

1637
01:00:26,798 --> 01:00:30,400
know what they're talking about but we

1638
01:00:28,239 --> 01:00:32,318
have a pretty high quality of

1639
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:34,400
expertise and exchange on the list that

1640
01:00:32,318 --> 01:00:36,719
i'm pretty proud of so

1641
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:37,760
a number of ways bylander by sea of

1642
01:00:36,719 --> 01:00:42,318
getting the message

1643
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:45,200
and i certainly welcome people to

1644
01:00:42,318 --> 01:00:46,159
to join us at the international biochar

1645
01:00:45,199 --> 01:00:47,838
initiative

1646
01:00:46,159 --> 01:00:49,838
which is a membership organization and

1647
01:00:47,838 --> 01:00:51,920
the us biochar initiative

1648
01:00:49,838 --> 01:00:53,920
which is basically uh just an active

1649
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:55,519
community

1650
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:57,200
well that's great i sure appreciate your

1651
01:00:55,519 --> 01:01:00,239
work in promoting this

1652
01:00:57,199 --> 01:01:02,879
technology and renewable uh resource

1653
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:04,959
for people and i'll be sure to put those

1654
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:06,000
links on the podcast page as well for

1655
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:08,400
people who are listening

1656
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:09,920
and uh i look forward to staying in

1657
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:12,960
touch and hearing

1658
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:17,680
what the future holds for biochar

1659
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:21,039
well thank you we certainly enjoy

1660
01:01:17,679 --> 01:01:24,318
your participation and promotion and

1661
01:01:21,039 --> 01:01:25,679
and so on of biochar and and we think

1662
01:01:24,318 --> 01:01:29,279
that everybody can benefit

1663
01:01:25,679 --> 01:01:31,039
so oh absolutely i absolutely i love

1664
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:32,079
using it in our soils i see such a

1665
01:01:31,039 --> 01:01:35,440
difference

1666
01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:37,599
uh in the quality of the

1667
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:39,119
vegetables and other you know other

1668
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:41,119
plants that we grow in it so

1669
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:42,720
i yeah i can't say enough good things

1670
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:44,720
about biochar

1671
01:01:42,719 --> 01:01:46,639
so i i don't i don't think we'll ever

1672
01:01:44,719 --> 01:01:50,719
stop using it it's just it's so great

1673
01:01:46,639 --> 01:01:52,639
so yeah well thanks again i will

1674
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:55,038
stay in touch and appreciate your time

1675
01:01:52,639 --> 01:01:56,929
today great thank you very much

1676
01:01:55,039 --> 01:02:04,240

and by the way we carry the black owl

1685
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:23,599
biochar from biochar supreme which in my

1686
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:25,280
opinion is the highest quality

1687
01:02:23,599 --> 01:02:27,119
most researched and most consistent

1688
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:27,760
commercially available biochar on the

1689
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:29,440
market

1690
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:31,200
we've used it in our soil mixes for

1691
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:33,519
years now and also have it available by

1692
01:02:31,199 --> 01:02:36,960
the cubic foot bag or by the yard

1693
01:02:33,519 --> 01:02:36,960
thanks for your support and happy

1694
01:02:40,599 --> 01:02:43,599
growing
