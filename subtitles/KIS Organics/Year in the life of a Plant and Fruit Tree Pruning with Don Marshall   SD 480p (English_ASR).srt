1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:07,040
so yesterday I recorded a presentation

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:09,280
for our local sand and soil Garden Club

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,960
that I'm a member at um of a good friend

4
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:14,599
of mine Don Marshall came out to speak

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:16,800
and uh unfortunately the quality of the

6
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:18,039
video is not that great um I was I

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,679
didn't have the camera in a very good

8
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:23,599
spot I'm going to get better at this as

9
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:26,920
I go um but the audio is excellent and

10
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:28,599
the content is amazing so I've known da

11
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:31,320
uh since I was a kid actually he was

12
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:34,000
good friends with my parents um

13
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,439
he he actually um is the reason I went

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,960
back to school to get uh to take courses

15
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:39,558
in botney was because I knew he was

16
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,160
retiring and I wanted to take his

17
00:00:39,558 --> 00:00:43,718
classes and he is one of the most

18
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:45,319
amazing uh Educators I've ever met and

19
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:47,280

20
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:49,600
online botney course with him that we

21
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,160

22
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,960
myself and other gardeners who want to

23
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:56,640
learn this stuff um but don't have the

24
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:59,480
time uh or or frankly the inclination to

25
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,280
go back to school to take these classes

26
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:04,000

55
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:08,319
starting to Garden my daughter asked me

56
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,319
if Tomatoes were coming back next

57
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:15,039
year I had to say where did you grow up

58
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:16,959
are you kidding me but I didn't say that

59
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:21,280
I didn't say that I just said wow no I

60
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:23,199
don't think so um anyway so Ted asked me

61
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,560
to speak on fruit tree

62
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:28,839
pruning is that right in

63
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,120
November I said November I said that's

64
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,000
not the time to talk about he said well

65
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,959
that's what they want they want to hear

66
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,159
about fruit tree pruning I thought do

67
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,319
you really is that what you really want

68
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:40,919
to hear about is fruit tree pruning any

69
00:02:37,318 --> 00:02:42,919
PR any okay to make things look nicer

70
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:44,639
okay so well to make make things look

71
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:46,839
nicer well even fruit tree pruning can

72
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:49,878
do that as well so what I've done is

73
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:52,000
I've you know I'm a teacher and I um

74
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:54,959
everything I do is that way you know I

75
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,840
brought a quiz for you and so it's on

76
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,479
the sideboard right over there labeled 1

77
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,759
through six and you can take the test

78
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:04,479
the answer is on the back so if you want

79
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:06,679
to because because I thought okay when

80
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:09,639
we're talking fruit trees unless you

81
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:12,319
know what it is how can you prune it

82
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:13,759
you've got to know what it is you know

83
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:15,839
but then I started thinking about okay

84
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:17,679
if we're going to talk fruit trees no I

85
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,959
don't want to talk fruit trees yet I

86
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,360
want to go through the seasons I want to

87
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:24,519
go through a year in the life of a plant

88
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:27,040
Because unless you really

89
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:29,239
understand what is a plant and what is

90
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:31,000
this organism doing and this would take

91
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:32,959
like 10 minutes to just get you all on

92
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,959
ground zero and it really came home to

93
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:38,000
me when my next door neighbor those are

94
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:40,719
often the most difficult aren't they

95
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,438
said to me well you know my my prune

96
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:46,000
tree has never blown never fruited it

97
00:03:43,438 --> 00:03:48,359
doesn't fruit at all and yours fruit I

98
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,519
don't understand it I thought well let's

99
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:54,480
have this conversation again um I said

100
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:56,719
the reason your tree is not fruity is

101
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:59,039
because you have people come and Shear

102
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:00,479
them and when did they come and Shear

103
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:04,639
them

104
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:07,959
two weeks ago fruit trees bloom on last

105
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:10,719
year's wood and if you prune all last

106
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:11,920
year's wood off then the stupid tree

107
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:15,478
won't

108
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:18,759
fruit it's not the stupid

109
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:20,120
tree it's the owner anyway we go through

110
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,560
I go through this I said you need you

111
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,160
need to think about this you need to

112
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:26,478
think about when you prune determines

113
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,800
when you have fruit and I would run

114
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:31,079
across this many many times when I was

115
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,840
Consulting when I had my own business

116
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:34,800
and in my head I never said it to

117
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:36,799
clients but in my head I always think

118
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,520
you're not thinking like a plant you're

119
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,280
not thinking like what is going on here

120
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:42,519
instead so I thought I try to teach

121
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:44,399
people to think critically so I'm going

122
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:47,079
to do that for you today and if you look

123
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:52,198
on your handout some of the things got

124
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:53,359
cut off um but go to the back page that

125
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:55,000
starts

126
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,479
with

127
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,120
uh starts with I think when to prune

128
00:04:57,478 --> 00:05:01,800
when to lightly prune hard prune

129
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,918
fertiliz transplant do you see that at

130
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:07,800
the top of one page and there's extra

131
00:05:04,918 --> 00:05:07,799
handouts where are the

132
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:15,199
extras I didn't I should

133
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:16,439
have um no this is my I don't have any

134
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,879
cop if you could just look on with

135
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:18,879
somebody and

136
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,759
she'll okay I didn't many

137
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,839
people so you guys could share a little

138
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:32,680
okay so on on the top of that page some

139
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:34,399
write the months of the year okay just

140
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,199
so you know this is January represents

141
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:38,679
January February March April May June

142
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:39,759
July August September okay because what

143
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,360
what we're going to do is we're going to

144
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,199
say all right let's think about a plant

145
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:47,960
I'm in my yard I'm in my garden and

146
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:50,360
there's my rose bush or there's my weila

147
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:52,599
whatever you want to say what's really

148
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:55,240
going on with you so let's start and all

149
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:57,439
the answers are down on this column and

150
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:00,000
so you could also put the months by

151
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:01,199
those also if you wanted to so we're

152
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,399
going to we're going to talk about this

153
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:07,960
so so dormy when is dormy Win winter

154
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:09,758
which is let's say January okay so

155
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:12,198
January we're in Winter and we're going

156
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,680
to talk about an average year which I

157
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:15,759
know with climate change there is no

158
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,280
average year anymore every year is a

159
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,960
100-year flood or whatever so we're

160
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:21,638
going to basically talk about okay

161
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:24,198
what's what's really going on so right

162
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:27,120
now January it's dormant the plant is

163
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:29,439
dormant is the plant dead no the plant

164
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,759
is still respiring meaning it's still

165
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:33,879
carrying on growth processes root growth

166
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:37,479
may be growing in the ground even if

167
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:39,240
it's above freezing if it's like 40 42

168
00:06:37,478 --> 00:06:41,639
degrees in the soil Roots continue to

169
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,360
grow even though there's not top growth

170
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:45,240
okay so there's still interactions going

171
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,038
on you know that plant is alive how do

172
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,240
you know if something's alive or dead

173
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:50,800
you scratch the bark with your

174
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,800
fingernail comes up brown it's dead if

175
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,160
it comes up green it's alive how many

176
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,960
times you looked at your raspberries and

177
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,520
thought I don't know if this is alive or

178
00:06:55,959 --> 00:07:02,719
dead and you scratch it and go whoa it's

179
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:05,279
alive I would have cut that out okay so

180
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,360
so we're dormant here in February what's

181
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:09,318
going

182
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:11,240
on dormy and maybe by the end of

183
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:13,520
February things are starting to come out

184
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,560
of dormy we're talking internally within

185
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:17,478
the plant you may not be seeing it but

186
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:20,560
internally the plant is starting to go

187
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:23,560
through dorcy the plant is a responder

188
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,918
responder to what day length temperature

189
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,720
day temperature night temperature light

190
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:29,799
intensity those kind of things so the

191
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,479
plants are responder well you know the

192
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,720
end of January you you know don't you

193
00:07:31,478 --> 00:07:36,279
always think if I could just get through

194
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:38,520
January 31st I'm home free because

195
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:41,638
November and December can be so gray and

196
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:44,439
so dark okay so so really the plant is

197
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:46,879
feeling that way also so starting in

198
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:48,719
February it's getting a little warmer

199
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,000
plant processes are starting to kick in

200
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,360
gear you're saying well I don't see

201
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,240
anything growing you're right you're not

202
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,080
seeing anything growing at that

203
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:59,840
time starting at about March we start to

204
00:07:56,079 --> 00:08:01,800
get a grow surge buds start to swell you

205
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:04,878
can see it you can see it in your plants

206
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:07,158
buds start to swell of course bulbs are

207
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,840
blooming those kinds of things we start

208
00:08:07,158 --> 00:08:12,959
to get this growth surge in March and in

209
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:15,279
April and man in April we get a growth

210
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:17,198
surge don't we it's like whoa things

211
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:19,119
start to go you know they start to move

212
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:22,478
they start to grow you can see the new

213
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:24,759
growth coming um we may get in April and

214
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:27,079
in may we may get some flowers if it's a

215
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:28,960
spring Bloomer start to get the aelas

216
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:30,158
and the Roes and the early Roes and all

217
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:33,838
kinds the things starting to come in the

218
00:08:30,158 --> 00:08:35,799
Foria in February you know the epimedium

219
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,839
the plums start to bloom pretty early

220
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:41,079
the cherries Bloom early so so that's

221
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:43,479
going on and in in March and in April

222
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:45,480
and in May and possibly if it was an

223
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:48,000
early spring Bloomer in may we start to

224
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,920
get a little fruit set okay you may get

225
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,958
some fruit setting after the

226
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:54,039
flowers sometimes the fruit is very very

227
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:56,599
small I'm not talking about edible but

228
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:59,199
even maple trees you know a red maple

229
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:01,839
blooms in February it sets its fruit

230
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:05,200
fruit in April and in May and by June it

231
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:06,880
drops it off so some of your maple trees

232
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,399
drop have put on fruit drop them off

233
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:10,480
right away and so you may be getting

234
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,639
fruits dropping at this time of year as

235
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,519
well not if you're a big leaf maple you

236
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:18,000
hold those on for a lot longer and so

237
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:21,720
what's going on in June June you know I

238
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,399
love June it's like green month it is so

239
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:26,879
electric green the vine Maples are so

240
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:29,519
bright the Douglas furs are so bright

241
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:32,639
all this new growth has come it took all

242
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:34,879
this time to start to grow break dormy

243
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:38,159
start to grow leaves are expanding by

244
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:40,919
June the leaves are just really

245
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:43,199
expanding okay often June used to be a

246
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:45,039
very rainy month and so we would get

247
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,000
cool temperatures we would get rain we

248
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:49,240
used to call it junuary remember and it

249
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,759
would be and and the the leaves are

250
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,360
really expanding it's green it's green

251
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:56,720
month

252
00:09:53,360 --> 00:10:00,919
um by the time it hits May and June the

253
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:03,959
plant is exhausted it's like like wow

254
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:06,319
that was a lot I just put out a lot of

255
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:09,159
energy that's when my food reserves are

256
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,320
at the lowest St that's when I'm

257
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:14,078
hungriest that's when if I'm going to

258
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:16,240
add some nutrients especially synthetic

259
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:18,239
but if you're adding organic the organic

260
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,959
nutrients are going to be tied into the

261
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,159
microbial activity which as it starts to

262
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:25,799
warm up and moisture is available it

263
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:28,360
starts releasing nutrients plant says oh

264
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:29,639
good I am ready for some bring it on let

265
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,639
me eat

266
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:34,559
and so it will start absorbing a lot

267
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:36,039
during this time okay during May and in

268
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:38,000
June if you have blueberries for

269
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:39,599
instance you know by June they're

270
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,200
starting to put on fruit and the fruit's

271
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,000
starting to expand because in July

272
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,200
they're going to be ripe okay um what

273
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,240
happens in

274
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:51,759
July starts to get hot starts to get hot

275
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,680
and we start to get drought we start to

276
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:55,078
get some dry periods last couple years

277
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:57,359
we've had that a lot earlier haven't we

278
00:10:55,078 --> 00:11:00,359
June's been very hot and sunny but in

279
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,839
average years you know in average years

280
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,879
July 4th holiday is ruined by the rain

281
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:06,079
and then July 5th it turns nice you're

282
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:08,439
back to

283
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:10,159
work great holiday in the rain in the

284
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:13,200
tent but you know you're now back to

285
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:15,600
work so anyway it gets hot the plant

286
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,360
starts to go through a little bit of

287
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:21,000
beginning of little bit of drought

288
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:23,399
stress by August we're in drought stress

289
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,559
by August it we've you know the end of

290
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:29,919
July can be very sunny very bright very

291
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:31,919
hot not a lot of rain the plant is

292
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:34,439
starting to experience drought stress

293
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:36,199
August it can be drought stressed have

294
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,880
you seen some years it's been so hot

295
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:41,200
that in August some plants kind of give

296
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:44,159
up and just say I'm going to lose we're

297
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:46,079
done I I can't support you anymore you

298
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:49,639
know and so they they've dropped some

299
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:52,439
plants dropped leaves in in August um by

300
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:54,159
the end of August there's all kinds of

301
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:56,320
hormonal changes going on in the plant

302
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:59,600
and the plant is saying prepare for

303
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:02,278
dormy daylight is shrinking whoop whoop

304
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,959
whoop Downstream so you don't even see

305
00:12:02,278 --> 00:12:08,838
it but by the end of August the plant is

306
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:10,759
now going okay day length is shorter we

307
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:12,880
might even put in a few blossoms because

308
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:16,838
as you look at you look at the distance

309
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:19,720
from June out here and here some spring

310
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:22,680
Bloomers put on a secondary Bloom it's

311
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:25,680
not global warming or the sky is falling

312
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:27,919
I get these things my my dog Wood's

313
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:29,599
blooming and it's September I knew the

314
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:31,479
world was screwed up

315
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,000
it's like well no actually they do put

316
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:35,519
on a secondary Bloom and so do Ries and

317
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,799
so do a lot of things up the world is

318
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,919
still screwed up but it's not impacting

319
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:40,919
your plants that way okay you still get

320
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:43,679
some

321
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:47,399
blooms so by

322
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:49,278
September the plant is big into start

323
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:52,480
migrating all of your nutrients and

324
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:55,600
sugars and calcium magnesium back to the

325
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:58,519
plant because it's now very aware that

326
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,240
it's going to start losing its leaves

327
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:03,278
and the plant doesn't suddenly lose its

328
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:06,879
leaves and go whoa what was that about

329
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:08,278
now I've lost all these leaves shoot I

330
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:11,360
put all that energy into them and now

331
00:13:08,278 --> 00:13:14,120
they're gone it migrates everything so

332
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:17,399
that we know October which is what Leaf

333
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:18,879
color month October is like leaves you

334
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:21,759
know it's great by the time you're

335
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:23,639
seeing leaves most of those nutrients

336
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:27,480
have migrated from the leaves to the

337
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:29,399
petol into the stem even scale insects

338
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:32,320
are going

339
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:35,120
they go oo I think osmotic pressure is

340
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:37,199
changing everybody don't move let's go

341
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,639
back to the main stem this Leaf is

342
00:13:37,198 --> 00:13:42,120
dropping and we're going with it and so

343
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:44,198
those scales can migrate back to the

344
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,278
stem because they know those leaves are

345
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:47,879
going to drop and they don't want to be

346
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:51,639
on a sunken ship so by the time those

347
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:54,480
leaves drop that leaf is just a carbon

348
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:56,680
vessel that's really all it is and it's

349
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,360
going to add carbon to the soil it's

350
00:13:56,679 --> 00:14:01,519
going to be food for microbial activity

351
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:03,039
but it's it's not like gee we put all

352
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:06,198
that energy into that leaf and now it's

353
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:09,319
gone huh that's too bad it's very

354
00:14:06,198 --> 00:14:11,838
planned I mean it's a very logical thing

355
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:16,120
that's going on here in response to what

356
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:18,920
day length temperatures hormones inside

357
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:22,039
the plant and outside the plant November

358
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:24,198
is what wind month isn't it wind and

359
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:25,759
rain and cold we still have some

360
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:28,039
beautiful leaves like yesterday what a

361
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:30,639
great day yesterday was but it's still

362
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:32,078
leaves are dry shopping I just got rid

363
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,159
of some of my leaves and when I went out

364
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:36,159
this morning it's all over again there's

365
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:38,198
leaves all over my walkway it's like I

366
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:40,039
thought I just got rid of those um and

367
00:14:38,198 --> 00:14:44,159
then what happens in December we're back

368
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:46,919
into dormy right and so this is the year

369
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:48,719
in the life of a plant knowing that

370
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:50,879
knowing the year in the life of a plant

371
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,759
can help you make decisions on your

372
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:57,120
fruit trees on your raspberries on

373
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:59,959
whatever on whatever you're pruning

374
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:02,879
because if I'm going to okay here's an

375
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:06,239
example if I have a laurel hedge that's

376
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:08,399
30 by 30 it's gotten way too big and I

377
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,519
want to do some drastic pruning I don't

378
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,958
want to take it out but it's just gotten

379
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:14,320
way too big and I'm going to cut it down

380
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:15,838
to stumps and I've done some research

381
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:19,000
and I know that I can do that I can take

382
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:22,639
a laurel down to Wood and it will Sprout

383
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,519
from there well when should I do this

384
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,919
when is the best time to cut my Laurel

385
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:29,560
hedge based on the year in life of a

386
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:32,759
plant can anyone venture

387
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:34,879
when would be good DEC January January

388
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:37,919
December January January

389
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:39,519
February and you guys are right on in

390
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:41,399
terms of your processing of this

391
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,399
information this is good you're going to

392
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:47,480
want to do it during dormy right before

393
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:50,318
growth surge February March right before

394
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,759
your grow surge why because by removing

395
00:15:50,318 --> 00:15:55,318
all that

396
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:57,639
stuff the plant has all this stored food

397
00:15:55,318 --> 00:15:59,559
which it's going to use to rejuvenate

398
00:15:57,639 --> 00:16:02,440
and you've taken off two-thirds of the

399
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:04,919
plant that means this extensive root

400
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:07,360
system which has a lot of stored food in

401
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:10,159
it is going to go

402
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,039
wow and it's going to come right back

403
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:14,919
it's going to go right back so you could

404
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:16,278
conceivably by July have enough growth

405
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:19,240
where you're actually cutting some of it

406
00:16:16,278 --> 00:16:20,838
back and redirecting it but I had a

407
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,318
neighbor my old house I'm always

408
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:25,600
thinking of neighbors because they make

409
00:16:22,318 --> 00:16:27,439
S mistakes I don't but anyway I had a

410
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,720
neighbor who pruned a laurel hedge just

411
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:32,040
like that and he pruned it in

412
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:34,319
October and we were taking a walk and I

413
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:37,278
said oh great we'll be looking at those

414
00:16:34,318 --> 00:16:41,120
stumps for the next year and you know

415
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:44,360
those stumps didn't come back oh it

416
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,039
ended up those stumps DED down ended up

417
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:48,800
sended shoots I mean Laurel's pretty

418
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:51,039
hearty sended shoots from the base maybe

419
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:53,120
one of them sprouted but an awful lot of

420
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:57,039
them died down plus they were looking at

421
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:59,600
it October November December January

422
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:02,039
February March every time you look at it

423
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,440
you go what are you thinking what were

424
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:04,918
you thinking you know what were you

425
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,439
thinking but it's because they didn't

426
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:10,759
understand the year of a life of a plant

427
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,919
really when to do it you know okay let's

428
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:15,720
talk another example how about

429
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:17,959
fertilizing if I'm going to fertilize my

430
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:19,919
blueberries or my

431
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:22,640
strawberries you start hearing on the

432
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:24,400
radio in February oh time to fertilize

433
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,000
time to fertilize get your fer so you

434
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,519
throw all this fertilizer out in

435
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
February especially if it's synthetic

436
00:17:28,519 --> 00:17:32,759
because synthetic is just going to be

437
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,279
very movable with the

438
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:36,960
groundwater it's still raining the plant

439
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:39,599
doesn't need it the plant doesn't want

440
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:42,000
it the plant goes uses all its energy in

441
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:44,798
its grow surge with stored food when

442
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,440
does the plant need it right as it's

443
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:50,400
starting to right after its grow surge

444
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:53,000
right after its grow surge when it's

445
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,080
like that was a lot of energy oh good

446
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,679
look what's here they just put some

447
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:58,240
composted chicken manure on here and

448
00:17:56,679 --> 00:18:01,320
there's a lot of nitrogen on here and I

449
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:05,400
can use that okay so so again you're

450
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:06,759
asking yourself um when to do things

451
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:10,679
okay let's take another example I had a

452
00:18:06,759 --> 00:18:12,200
client once uh who said this small hedge

453
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:14,840
outside my off I was maintaining his

454
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:17,480
office commercially uh every week I was

455
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:19,959
there and he said can you cut this hedge

456
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:21,960
back and I and it was a secondary

457
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:23,519
walkway it was a private walkway for him

458
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,079
going to his office it wasn't like a

459
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:27,720
main walkway where there were customers

460
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:31,399
coming in and so I said well and this

461
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:33,120
was like may I said yeah I I can do that

462
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:35,400
right now I guess it was April I said I

463
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:37,000
could do that but I said in two months

464
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,240
you're gonna have to pay me to do it

465
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,599
again he said I don't want to pay you to

466
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:43,599
do it again I said well right now the

467
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:45,599
plant is going through a grow surge so

468
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:49,359
if I prune that right

469
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:51,119
now it's going to respond by

470
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:53,199
going and then you're going to be

471
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:54,798
unhappy again in a couple months and he

472
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:58,919
said what do you suggest I said can we

473
00:18:54,798 --> 00:19:01,119
wait till July 1st July 1st the plant

474
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:03,600
has gone through its grow surge any

475
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:06,678
pruning you do in July guess what it

476
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:10,000
stays there any pruning of that hedge

477
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:12,240
you do in April and it goes

478
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,440
whatever you're like wait I just pruned

479
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:18,079
you or I just paid to have you pruned

480
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,720
and now I got to pay again so therefore

481
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:22,960
thinking about okay if I'm going to pay

482
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:25,319
somebody once a year to prune my hedge

483
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:28,319
then I'm going to do it after its grow

484
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:30,639
surge when it gets hot when it gets hot

485
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:33,119
you know I I actually was taught I grew

486
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:36,120
up in New England and I was taught as a

487
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:39,199
kid you don't prune things in the

488
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:41,879
fall because then they sprout new growth

489
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,880
and then it gets frozen

490
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:48,240
off that's all

491
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:51,159
folklore the plant doesn't suddenly undo

492
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:54,319
nighttime temperature daylength all this

493
00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:56,760
other stuff and go oh let's start to

494
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:59,439
grow it doesn't it just doesn't do that

495
00:19:56,759 --> 00:20:00,759
it doesn't happen so you really want to

496
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,038
think about all right so what am I

497
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:05,200
trying to do with those plant and it

498
00:20:02,038 --> 00:20:06,640
kind of brings us back to fruit trees

499
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,159
and where I

500
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,360
started the first thing on any plant in

501
00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:11,640
your landscape that you're going to want

502
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:14,279
to do before you prune it is you're

503
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:17,038
going to want to say what's my objective

504
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:18,879
here and if my objective is flowers or

505
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:20,720
fruit which it usually is on a fruit

506
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,760
tree I mean we grow fruit trees why

507
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,360
because I want the apples or I want the

508
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:26,759
plums not because the flowers are pretty

509
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:28,759
which they are pretty but on the other

510
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:30,759
hand doesn't work

511
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:35,400
so you have to ask yourself on what wood

512
00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:37,839
does it fruit and if it fruits on

513
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:40,280
Spurs and a Spur is a short and

514
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:43,000
compressed stem it's a little stub if it

515
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:45,119
fruits on Spurs then it has to take a

516
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,798
couple years a year or two certainly by

517
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:50,439
year two to produce the Spurs so you go

518
00:20:47,798 --> 00:20:52,798
in there and you do all this pruning and

519
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:55,679
then the stupid tree doesn't

520
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:57,759
fruit it's not thee it's not the tree

521
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,880
it's what you did to it it's a time of

522
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:03,079
year that you that you pruned it now a

523
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:04,919
peach on the other hand blooms on

524
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:07,119
second-year wood but it but only

525
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:09,679
second-year wood so you do a lot of

526
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:10,918
heavy pring on peaches because it's

527
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,679
going to put out new growth and that's

528
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:13,880
going to

529
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:19,120
fruit okay so it just depends on what

530
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:21,000
type of wood the tree fruits on okay so

531
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:23,278
so let's go back any questions on year

532
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,038
in life of a plant I think this is

533
00:21:23,278 --> 00:21:27,720
helpful

534
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:29,278
because next time when you prune you can

535
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,640
think okay what's going on with this

536
00:21:29,278 --> 00:21:33,359
plant here and what do I want it to do

537
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:35,840
and some plants are different roses for

538
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:38,639
instance why do we keep pruning roses

539
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:40,599
because we want lots of flowers and so

540
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,038
they do grow they bloom cut it back they

541
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:45,000
do blow they bloom they cut it back you

542
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:47,759
know you do a lot of cutting but when do

543
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,159
you do your extensive pruning on

544
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:52,440
roses March after we've had some hard

545
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:54,559
freezes Ted can you talk about your

546
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:56,558
fertilizing strategy for your your

547
00:21:54,558 --> 00:21:59,038
property like how you how you manage

548
00:21:56,558 --> 00:22:00,798
your fertility so okay so fertilizing

549
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:03,278
strategy for me the question was how do

550
00:22:00,798 --> 00:22:07,480
how do I manage fertilizing strategy my

551
00:22:03,278 --> 00:22:09,200
desire is to not fertilize once

552
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:11,480
established and we have to put that in

553
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,200
our head even drought tolerant plants

554
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:16,519
are not drought tolerant the first

555
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:18,720
couple years it has to go through a

556
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:19,839
couple Winters because remember plants

557
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,480
like that's why this is such a great

558
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:24,038
time of year to plant because plants are

559
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:25,919
going to continue to establish you know

560
00:22:24,038 --> 00:22:27,440
I have a son-in-law who's putting in new

561
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:30,080
grass seed and I said you got till

562
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:32,080
October 15 to get that grass seed in and

563
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:34,038
he said why and I said because October

564
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:36,399
15th gives you two weeks so we have our

565
00:22:34,038 --> 00:22:39,480
first Frost in November which we've

566
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:41,240
already had our first Frost um and then

567
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:45,480
it will grow all winter

568
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:47,720
long and grass that you plant in um

569
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:49,880
October you'll be playing on in June

570
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:52,440
grass that you plant in April May you'll

571
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:54,840
be playing on the following April or

572
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:56,519
May so that's that's why it's important

573
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:59,158
so my f that was a really Bird walk

574
00:22:56,519 --> 00:23:01,038
wasn't it my fertilizing strategy uh in

575
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:03,120
my yard is once things are established I

576
00:23:01,038 --> 00:23:05,519
don't fertilize it I don't rake off

577
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:08,399
leaves I add a lot of organic matter I

578
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:11,759
use chips as mulch because I'm trying to

579
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:16,159
improve soil structure in my in my

580
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:18,158
Gardens I do fertilize with nutrients I

581
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:23,000
do restore nutrients in my vegetable

582
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:25,080
garden in my berry patches my apples I

583
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,599
do some very little because they're

584
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:30,879
established trees and I test soil once a

585
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:33,158
year see what's going on where there's

586
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,200
deficiencies and then add nutrients to

587
00:23:33,159 --> 00:23:36,799
the vegetable garden because what we're

588
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,278
doing in a vegetable garden is really

589
00:23:36,798 --> 00:23:41,558
you know we're taking off we're taking

590
00:23:38,278 --> 00:23:44,440
off we're taking off we can't just say

591
00:23:41,558 --> 00:23:45,839
um we can't just say well the leaves

592
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:47,120
will take care of it or the grass

593
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:49,038
clippings will take care of it or the

594
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:52,158
organic matter will take care of it you

595
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:53,720
know we're adding nutrients to round

596
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:55,240
them out and get better production

597
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:58,000
because my goal for my vegetable garden

598
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:59,960
is production not because I want to weed

599
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,679
my vegetable garden when when do you

600
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:06,519
apply the to your vegetable garden your

601
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:08,320
so when do I apply to my to my vegetable

602
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:10,519
garden so the the really thing you want

603
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:11,678
to think about is two major categories

604
00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:14,839
synthetic

605
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:17,480
fertilizers and organic fertilizers

606
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:19,798
organic fertilizers much of what's in an

607
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:21,360
organic fertilizer is tied up in

608
00:24:19,798 --> 00:24:24,720
microbial

609
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:28,918
activity in your soil microbial activity

610
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:33,159
is tied up in what temperature

611
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:36,240
um water availability oxygen levels so

612
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:38,840
therefore good soil structure improves

613
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,480
microbial activity which is going to

614
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:42,398
help and and the funny thing about this

615
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:45,519
microbial activity is that they're most

616
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:47,599
active during the active growing season

617
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:50,359
and when are the plants in need during

618
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:53,119
the active growing season whereas if you

619
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:56,839
put on a bag of triple 16 and you put it

620
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:58,759
in put it on now um plants don't really

621
00:24:56,839 --> 00:24:59,798
need it the nitrates will make them

622
00:24:58,759 --> 00:25:01,960
green

623
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:04,519
up um but most of it's going to be

624
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:06,840
washed down through the ground profile

625
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:08,759
through the water is that where we're

626
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:10,879
where you're going with that yeah so do

627
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:12,119
you like for your vegetable garden then

628
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,679
do you wait

629
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:17,839
until you know April to test May no to

630
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:20,200
start applying your right I start

631
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:22,398
applying let's see I do I do a predom I

632
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:25,319
do a lot of

633
00:25:22,398 --> 00:25:26,959
um a lot of planting I do some early

634
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:29,599
planting of course I've done garlics and

635
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:32,480
stuff already but I do some early PL I

636
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:35,038
do some the bulk of the planting in

637
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,919
April okay so probably right around

638
00:25:35,038 --> 00:25:39,200
April is one I've done my testing

639
00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:43,159
earlier and I've gotten my nutrients

640
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:46,880
from you and then and then I uh and then

641
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:49,520
I apply them um probably April working

642
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:51,960
them into the soil okay and I'm not a

643
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:53,720
big till person I'm not tilling them I'm

644
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:58,558
just working them in and scratching them

645
00:25:53,720 --> 00:26:02,798
in okay okay any other question

646
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:06,240
questions yes so do you ever use osma

647
00:26:02,798 --> 00:26:09,639
coat I do use osma coat in container

648
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:12,839
plants like fuches um that are in a

649
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:16,360
basket something like that

650
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:18,240
um usually a container that I really

651
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:20,639
want a lot of color in or something like

652
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:23,399
that I I may use osmac code and

653
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:26,120
something like that um but that's really

654
00:26:23,398 --> 00:26:28,158
Pro I don't use it in the garden um I

655
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:30,719
don't use it in

656
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:33,000
ornamental plantings per se but I but I

657
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,240
use it in fuches because some of those

658
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,880
are pretty heavy feeders and it's a

659
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,440
little 12 12inch container needs a lot

660
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:43,080
of

661
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:44,240
nutrients yep okay okay so let's let's

662
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:46,798
talk

663
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:48,278
about let's let's talk about pruning in

664
00:26:46,798 --> 00:26:52,720
general and we'll keep tying it back to

665
00:26:48,278 --> 00:26:54,960
fruit trees okay pruning in general um

666
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,960
you

667
00:26:55,519 --> 00:27:02,158
know okay this is this is an apple tree

668
00:26:59,079 --> 00:27:04,918
oh let's let me dig let me talk about

669
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:06,720
this for for one more second you know

670
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:10,000
this year was a good year for fruit

671
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:14,240
trees do you agree good year we had good

672
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,960
fruit this year last year not so much

673
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,679
last year was

674
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:21,440
horrible um we had a terrible month of

675
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:24,960
March where we had a lot of things

676
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:27,798
blooming and the bees just said it's too

677
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:30,960
cold I'm not going out there I'm sorry

678
00:27:27,798 --> 00:27:32,918
so we had we had a lot of fruit that

679
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,679
never got pollinated lot of lot of

680
00:27:32,919 --> 00:27:36,880
flowers that never got pollinated so

681
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:38,880
last year was a terrible year and again

682
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,640
there's pockets and again some of my

683
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,799
fruit trees I have 50 fruit trees so

684
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:45,720
some of the fruit trees did produce

685
00:27:42,798 --> 00:27:47,759
fruit it was light and it was always the

686
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:49,880
later blooming apples that did produce

687
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:51,079
fruit the early blooming apples the

688
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:54,480
plums the

689
00:27:51,079 --> 00:27:55,960
cherries um some of the pairs forget it

690
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,759
I didn't get anything on some trees

691
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:00,558
there was nothing and that was because

692
00:27:58,759 --> 00:28:02,000
of the climate right that was because of

693
00:28:00,558 --> 00:28:05,158
what was going

694
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:08,919
on there was a year about 10 years

695
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:11,960
ago where we had a very very bad fruit

696
00:28:08,919 --> 00:28:14,480
year I was living on the east side had a

697
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:16,360
horrible horrible fruit year and I kept

698
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,839
thinking why we've had such a great

699
00:28:16,359 --> 00:28:20,759
spring we had a great spring the bees

700
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:23,119
were out it was warm and it was sunny I

701
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:25,720
don't understand it what then I went

702
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:28,439
back and looked at my notes we had had a

703
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:30,558
very hard freeze in November

704
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,480
so when the leaves were like this when

705
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:35,000
the even before this when the leaves

706
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:37,480
were were just were turning yellow and

707
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:40,440
stuff we had a killing Frost and we had

708
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:41,599
snow and it lasted about a week and you

709
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,840
thought oh no winter's going to be

710
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:46,038
horrible then it turned out winter

711
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:49,519
wasn't that bad but it was interrupting

712
00:28:46,038 --> 00:28:51,240
it was interrupting this this

713
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:53,798
Reclamation of

714
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:55,120
nutrients that totally impacted the

715
00:28:53,798 --> 00:28:58,000
following

716
00:28:55,119 --> 00:29:00,599
Spring's produce is isn't that

717
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:04,720
interesting when you think about that

718
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:07,398
and so weather climate temperatures are

719
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:09,519
so impactful on a on a fruit tree

720
00:29:07,398 --> 00:29:12,479
particularly on a fruit tree so anyway

721
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:13,558
it's kind of a side note okay so this is

722
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,240
an apple

723
00:29:13,558 --> 00:29:18,480
tree and we know I'm going to try to

724
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:21,079
follow my notes Here we know that many

725
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:23,558
plants have an apical Bud right they

726
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:26,079
have a terminal bud and this terminal

727
00:29:23,558 --> 00:29:28,480
bud has hormones in it and these

728
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:30,558
hormones control all the growth down

729
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:33,839
here this hormone in here says hey I'm

730
00:29:30,558 --> 00:29:37,720
in charge nobody goes out we're going up

731
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:39,678
got me and so these guys grow and grow

732
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:42,880
and grow and eventually when they get

733
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:45,519
farther away their impact on the lower

734
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:48,679
lateral buds is lessened and lessened to

735
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:50,120
the point where they produce these

736
00:29:48,679 --> 00:29:53,960
little

737
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:56,439
shoots okay by removing this terminal

738
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:58,399
bud what do you do you remove that

739
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:01,159
hormone that's in the that bud and the

740
00:29:58,398 --> 00:30:02,879
branch Sprouts right I mean take a

741
00:30:01,159 --> 00:30:05,120
fuchsia take anything you know you're

742
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:08,159
like I want it to Bush out you pinch it

743
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:10,239
it goes and all those little branches

744
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:12,320
have terminal buds as well and it

745
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,720
controls that and so they're controlling

746
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:16,558
their own Side branch and their own Side

747
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:19,200
branch their own Side branch all right

748
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:21,558
so we know we've got a terminal Bud

749
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:24,440
we've got lateral buds in here we have

750
00:30:21,558 --> 00:30:27,720
nodes the node is where the bud meets

751
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:31,120
the um stem and we've got the inner node

752
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:35,000
which is the distance between nodes okay

753
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:36,439
so this is an apple tree and so I'm

754
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,599
going to bounce around a little I hope

755
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:41,360
this is okay this is an apple tree most

756
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:43,158
apples produce fruit on

757
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:45,759
Spurs okay and you're comfortable with

758
00:30:43,159 --> 00:30:47,840
that word spur and cherries produce on

759
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:50,278
Spurs plums produce on Spurs pears

760
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:52,359
produce on Spurs but the biggest

761
00:30:50,278 --> 00:30:55,278
frustrating thing that people don't

762
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:56,240
understand is that apples produce fruit

763
00:30:55,278 --> 00:30:58,038
on

764
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,839
Spurs

765
00:30:58,038 --> 00:31:01,480
how do you get a Spur to produce I mean

766
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:05,798
how do you get it to create

767
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:08,798
Spurs all right plants have a growth

768
00:31:05,798 --> 00:31:09,960
surge so this is my Apple branch and

769
00:31:08,798 --> 00:31:13,599
because you can't see it from where

770
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:16,200
you're sitting here's a terminal Bud

771
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:19,480
here's side buds side buds side buds

772
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:20,679
side buds side buds then as you go down

773
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:23,720
the

774
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:25,440
stem you see a group of concentric

775
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:28,038
circles right

776
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:30,038
here okay

777
00:31:28,038 --> 00:31:33,759
you can't see it but I can see it it's

778
00:31:30,038 --> 00:31:36,079
right here so I go to from tip to this

779
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:38,440
little concentric this little concentric

780
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:41,079
is called Bud scale

781
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:42,840
scars okay so this

782
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:45,599
is the

783
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:47,720
bud scale

784
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:50,319
SCAR or

785
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:52,639
scars the terminal Bud keep in mind the

786
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:56,000
terminal bud is what enclosed in Bud

787
00:31:52,638 --> 00:31:57,678
scales in the spring the bud scales all

788
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,079
drop off right

789
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:03,278
and the terminal starts to grow this is

790
00:32:01,079 --> 00:32:05,158
last year's growth where the buds scale

791
00:32:03,278 --> 00:32:06,200
scars were where the terminal Bud scale

792
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:09,519
scar was

793
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:10,720
were so from here to here is how much it

794
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:14,440
grew last

795
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:18,600
year so from here to here is how much it

796
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:21,278
grew last year now notice this

797
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:23,079
Branch can you guys in the back see that

798
00:32:21,278 --> 00:32:25,240
against the Whiteboard maybe notice on

799
00:32:23,079 --> 00:32:28,798
this Branch we're starting to get these

800
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:30,638
little Spurs Spurs really keep that in

801
00:32:28,798 --> 00:32:33,079
mind what is a Spur a short and

802
00:32:30,638 --> 00:32:35,398
compressed stem meaning it took a stem

803
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:38,079
that's growing and someone went it looks

804
00:32:35,398 --> 00:32:40,239
like someone squashed it and so you have

805
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:42,759
very close nodes inner nodes nodes in

806
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:45,638
nodes nodes inner nodes Spurs are built

807
00:32:42,759 --> 00:32:48,398
scientifically to hold weight like an

808
00:32:45,638 --> 00:32:50,798
apple an Apple's heavy and you know if

809
00:32:48,398 --> 00:32:53,798
you were to if you put brand an apple

810
00:32:50,798 --> 00:32:58,038
here it goes like this so that's why

811
00:32:53,798 --> 00:33:00,558
these spurs are built tougher Okay so

812
00:32:58,038 --> 00:33:04,398
terminal to Bud scale

813
00:33:00,558 --> 00:33:07,359
scars if I leave if I if I tip this I go

814
00:33:04,398 --> 00:33:09,398
in the spring and I go oh yeah I don't I

815
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:11,678
don't know how to prune my apples but I

816
00:33:09,398 --> 00:33:16,278
love my new shears that I got so I think

817
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:17,960
tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip and

818
00:33:16,278 --> 00:33:20,759
so we tip that whole

819
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:23,159
plant how does the plant respond if we

820
00:33:20,759 --> 00:33:25,558
tip

821
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:28,519
that that's right is it going to grow

822
00:33:25,558 --> 00:33:31,918
Spurs no it's going to do

823
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:37,440
this it's going to grow like that right

824
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:40,639
and then it stops okay so if I leave it

825
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:42,558
untipped if I leave it untipped the

826
00:33:40,638 --> 00:33:45,199
farther away this apical meristem now

827
00:33:42,558 --> 00:33:48,398
it's starting to grow in the spring it's

828
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:52,519
like hey guys we can grow she's

829
00:33:48,398 --> 00:33:55,398
gone so what happens you start to get

830
00:33:52,519 --> 00:33:57,359
spur growth right here spur growth right

831
00:33:55,398 --> 00:34:00,398
here spur growth right here spur growth

832
00:33:57,359 --> 00:34:03,398
right here once a Spur always a Spur a

833
00:34:00,398 --> 00:34:06,638
Spur is anatomically different than a

834
00:34:03,398 --> 00:34:09,838
branch so your goal with your fruit

835
00:34:06,638 --> 00:34:12,878
trees is to produce Spurs because if you

836
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:15,799
produce Spurs you're producing

837
00:34:12,878 --> 00:34:17,639
fruit once a Spur always a Spur so

838
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:19,480
therefore you're saying yeah but then

839
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:21,320
you've got this branch and it's going to

840
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:22,760
be kind of weak and if this gets heavily

841
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:26,599
weighted with fruit it's going to start

842
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:28,119
bending down okay the next year I can go

843
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:30,119
back

844
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:32,679
say I haven't tipped just like the one

845
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:37,039
in my hand I've not tipped

846
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:39,159
this and here it is March April May let

847
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:41,000
this thing grow these things will start

848
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:43,119
to produce

849
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,760
Spurs

850
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:49,079
um if I keep letting this grow I'll get

851
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:51,079
Spurs on here but then I can go back and

852
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:55,039
I can actually cut it to

853
00:34:51,079 --> 00:34:57,680
here to firm up to toughen up this wood

854
00:34:55,039 --> 00:35:00,800
to make this wood thicker to be able to

855
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:04,559
handle the weight of the fruit trees now

856
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:08,119
how's the plant going to respond well

857
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:10,838
it's going to grow some here grow some

858
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:13,039
here these are going to Spurs grow you

859
00:35:10,838 --> 00:35:16,358
know what Spurs grow they grow more

860
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:18,320
Spurs so you end up with a Spur Network

861
00:35:16,358 --> 00:35:20,440
in this whole area this will eventually

862
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:23,559
over time seven years 10 years you'll

863
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:25,880
start to have Spurs on all of

864
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:29,199
these and so you end up with quite a bit

865
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:31,680
of Spurs and so then you're going to get

866
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:34,439
fruit if you walk away with nothing else

867
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:37,239
walk away with tipping discourages spur

868
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:38,760
production I never read that in a book

869
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:42,639
and I was that

870
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:45,359
classic organic Gardener in his 20s got

871
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:47,480
his five acres put in a ton of fruit

872
00:35:45,358 --> 00:35:50,279
trees

873
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:53,559
wooo did the thinning read the book

874
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:55,800
degree in horiculture the whole

875
00:35:53,559 --> 00:35:57,559
bit and then right before I went in I

876
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:01,359
thought oh

877
00:35:57,559 --> 00:36:04,559
tip tip tip tip tip tip tip oh that

878
00:36:01,358 --> 00:36:08,078
feels better tip tip I've tipped

879
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:10,880
everything stupid plants never produce

880
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:13,119
fruit why I thought I'm in the industry

881
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:16,200
and I can't get my fruit trees to fruit

882
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:18,200
this is embarrassing why can't I get I

883
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:21,279
read books none of the books look like

884
00:36:18,199 --> 00:36:23,439
my trees oh yeah this is really clear I

885
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:25,680
get it you stand there with your shears

886
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,200
and you I have no idea what I'm doing

887
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:30,239
you read the book I have no no idea what

888
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:32,679
I'm doing what I learned through

889
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:36,159
self-examination was tipping discourages

890
00:36:32,679 --> 00:36:39,000
spur production it's so lifechanging

891
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:40,719
tipping discourages spur production if I

892
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,318
leave it untipped I keep getting more

893
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:45,598
Spurs and more Spurs and more Spurs even

894
00:36:43,318 --> 00:36:46,920
if I did tip this back say I tipped it

895
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,920
all the way back and I got a lot of

896
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:50,960
growth here and here well then I can now

897
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:53,599
go back and I can take remove the lower

898
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:56,000
stuff let this guy grow let him grow

899
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:57,519
some spurs up here and then I'll tip him

900
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,039
again

901
00:36:57,519 --> 00:37:02,559
because your goal is always to raise the

902
00:37:00,039 --> 00:37:05,318
head of the fruit tree the apple tree so

903
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:06,838
they're not going like this which they

904
00:37:05,318 --> 00:37:08,880
do because the weight of the fruit can

905
00:37:06,838 --> 00:37:11,279
do it and initially you may end up doing

906
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:13,440
some fruit thinning as painful as fruit

907
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,440
thinning is it's very rewarding because

908
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,599
you're like well at least I'm going to

909
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:18,639
get a lot of fruit I did so much fruit

910
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:22,599
thinning this year and still had way too

911
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:24,679
much fruit okay so so with with fruit

912
00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:27,599
trees if they produce fruit on Spurs

913
00:37:24,679 --> 00:37:30,480
tipping discourages spur production

914
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:33,800
yes uh the cause of those branches that

915
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:37,880
go vertical okay very good water sprouts

916
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:41,200
and and suckers okay so a sucker comes

917
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:44,400
from below the graft on the ground from

918
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:48,719
the root system that's a sucker a water

919
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:51,079
sprout is a vertical Branch growing like

920
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:54,078
that right it just comes straight up and

921
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:56,599
they're like this and you're like man

922
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:59,119
that's not good they were called water

923
00:37:56,599 --> 00:38:00,599
Sprouts cuz the turn of the century the

924
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:02,200
last century they thought they were

925
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:05,519
hooked into the water system of the

926
00:38:02,199 --> 00:38:07,759
plant and that's why they grew so fast

927
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:12,358
so my theory on dealing with water

928
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:14,599
sprouts and has worked and this ties in

929
00:38:12,358 --> 00:38:18,400
with with your year in the life of a

930
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:21,880
plant you've got this horizontal branch

931
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:24,079
and it goes like this every year and you

932
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:26,920
prune it every year and when do you

933
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:28,200
prune it February you know why do you

934
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:29,599
prune in February because you can see

935
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:31,399
branching structure that's why that's a

936
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:32,640
great time of year to plant I can see

937
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:36,240
all the branching

938
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:39,679
structure so you take this water sprouts

939
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:43,159
and you cut them all off plant says H

940
00:38:39,679 --> 00:38:47,239
great and does it again right so what I

941
00:38:43,159 --> 00:38:49,920
would do is I would take it all these

942
00:38:47,239 --> 00:38:51,679
water sprouts and in February I'd cut

943
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:55,519
them all

944
00:38:51,679 --> 00:39:00,078
off it responds doing it all over

945
00:38:55,519 --> 00:39:02,639
again and then in July of that same year

946
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:05,039
I go back and cut them all off again

947
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:08,159
they're thin they're like

948
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:10,358
pencils or thick marker pens they can be

949
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:11,598
pretty thick cut them off again how is

950
00:39:10,358 --> 00:39:14,239
the plank going to

951
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:16,838
respond it's not putting on

952
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:19,000
anymore you will be on an every from

953
00:39:16,838 --> 00:39:21,519
then on in you will be on an every July

954
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:24,880
cycle for your water

955
00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:26,920
sprouts okay and that July cycle will

956
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:28,720
start to reduce the number number of

957
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:30,318
water sprouts every year I know that

958
00:39:28,719 --> 00:39:32,239
when you're on a February cycle of water

959
00:39:30,318 --> 00:39:35,199
sprouts it just feels like it's getting

960
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:36,759
worse every year they just produce more

961
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:38,039
and more and more and more and you're

962
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:42,000
like stupid

963
00:39:38,039 --> 00:39:44,880
tree but it's just responding so so get

964
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:49,440
them get them done in February March and

965
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:51,880
then do them again when it's hot July

966
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:54,119
August you cut them all the way back and

967
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:57,760
you're cutting them all the way back to

968
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:59,240
good good question look on your trees

969
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,880
always look on your trees here's the

970
00:39:59,239 --> 00:40:03,919
trunk and picture the trunk being

971
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:06,559
sideways here's the trunk it comes down

972
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,559
and you have

973
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:12,759
this right can you picture that on a

974
00:40:10,599 --> 00:40:14,680
tree this is the same thing whether it's

975
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:17,319
a water sprout or whether it's a

976
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:19,799
branch so this is called the branch

977
00:40:17,318 --> 00:40:22,400
collar this section right here this this

978
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:25,119
is a switching Zone the switching Zone

979
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:27,559
from where the xylem and the flo go this

980
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:29,760
way and the xylm flam go up this way

981
00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:33,960
along the side of it and so you've get

982
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:38,800
this swollen area right here area right

983
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:40,880
here within this collar are hormones

984
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:43,000
that help the plant seal it off and

985
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,880
start to wall off

986
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,519
infection so

987
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:49,760
therefore say this is a heavy Branch my

988
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:51,639
first cut would be here my second cut

989
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:54,400
would be here to take off the

990
00:40:51,639 --> 00:40:57,000
weight now the thing is done now all I'm

991
00:40:54,400 --> 00:41:00,440
dealing with a little stub my next cut

992
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:03,318
is going to be here just slightly just

993
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:05,599
to go through the bark right here use a

994
00:41:03,318 --> 00:41:05,599
different

995
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:10,400
color so it's going to be right here and

996
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:13,240
then the rest is going to be right here

997
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:15,000
like that now I'm leaving on had people

998
00:41:13,239 --> 00:41:17,598
say to clients say you're leaving on all

999
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:20,280
these stubs no I'm not leaving on stubs

1000
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:23,280
I'm leaving on Branch collars Branch

1001
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:26,640
collars contain chemical compounds that

1002
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:31,000
will wall off from infection cuz what do

1003
00:41:26,639 --> 00:41:33,920
fungus fungus uses all of this wood as

1004
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,679
sugar and so if I were to if I were to

1005
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:38,318
cut it straight make a flesh cut

1006
00:41:35,679 --> 00:41:40,519
straight down my tree and go in here

1007
00:41:38,318 --> 00:41:42,279
look at what goes on now oh crap I'm

1008
00:41:40,519 --> 00:41:44,880
past the branch but I'm into the main

1009
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:46,720
trunk I have done a major wound to that

1010
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,920
plant and what's going to happen is

1011
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:51,078
fungus is going to attack right in here

1012
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:54,639
and start to get into this wood and in

1013
00:41:51,079 --> 00:41:56,599
this wood and if it's a soft barked

1014
00:41:54,639 --> 00:41:58,679
plant like an alder or a cotton wood or

1015
00:41:56,599 --> 00:42:00,800
a willow or even

1016
00:41:58,679 --> 00:42:03,639
Maples then you're going to get some rod

1017
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:05,200
in here but by leaving the branch collar

1018
00:42:03,639 --> 00:42:07,920
on

1019
00:42:05,199 --> 00:42:10,239
and your point was what about the how

1020
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:12,480
flesh do you cut those you're cutting to

1021
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:14,199
collars and because really on all these

1022
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,838
little branches right here they all

1023
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:18,078
you'll look at them they all have

1024
00:42:15,838 --> 00:42:20,239
collars even even all these water

1025
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:22,599
sprouts have a little bit of swollen

1026
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:25,479
area and then they go up so they have

1027
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:28,119
collars too you know that if you cut to

1028
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:31,079
here well there's buds here and instead

1029
00:42:28,119 --> 00:42:33,960
of one cut you'll have four next year

1030
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:36,440
times 10 now you got 40 Cuts okay it

1031
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:38,159
just exponentially starts to increase so

1032
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:41,599
the collar is a real important thing to

1033
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:45,318
start looking on your trees um Spruce is

1034
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:48,039
amazing Spruce it's so funny here's the

1035
00:42:45,318 --> 00:42:48,039
tree here's a

1036
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:56,720
spruce oh wow I mean I've done a spruce

1037
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:59,680
and it looks like this and you're like

1038
00:42:56,719 --> 00:43:02,879
you've left that 8 inch stub on that

1039
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:05,639
tree that's the collar yes I've left

1040
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:07,920
that 8 inch stub on the tree no paint no

1041
00:43:05,639 --> 00:43:09,719
tree heel no pruning Aid even though

1042
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:11,920
it's still on the market they've been

1043
00:43:09,719 --> 00:43:15,279
shown scientifically that they trap in

1044
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:17,200
moisture in organisms so what do you do

1045
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:20,680
Let It Go by

1046
00:43:17,199 --> 00:43:23,879
itself trees bleed don't they in June

1047
00:43:20,679 --> 00:43:27,919
Maples bleed in June if the bleeding

1048
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:30,599
disturbs you then do it in July by or do

1049
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:32,039
it in March when they're not bleeding

1050
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:33,920
okay there is no scientific evidence

1051
00:43:32,039 --> 00:43:35,679
that this bleeding which is literally

1052
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:38,079
water most of it but sweet water if

1053
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:41,078
you've ever tasted it is a problem to

1054
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:43,720
the plant it's not yes a little bit off

1055
00:43:41,079 --> 00:43:43,720
fruit trees

1056
00:43:47,559 --> 00:43:53,440
butes

1057
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:56,480
yes twice I won't ask you when you did

1058
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:58,559
it because anyway but okay so the ideal

1059
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:01,000
doing okay I was looking at mine

1060
00:43:58,559 --> 00:44:03,119
yesterday I have a beautiful Lacy leaf

1061
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,960
maple that the former owners took a

1062
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:07,519
chainsaw

1063
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:10,400
to and so I either decided I was going

1064
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:13,318
to rip it out because it was so horrible

1065
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:15,480
what they did my wife said no why don't

1066
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:16,838
you just let's work with it and so now

1067
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:18,358
it's beautiful it's starting but it's

1068
00:44:16,838 --> 00:44:20,159
but there's still a problem and I looked

1069
00:44:18,358 --> 00:44:23,880
at it yesterday and thought you know all

1070
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:26,759
the leaves are off now from now on I

1071
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:29,079
could do it I literally was combing out

1072
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:31,800
Dead Leaves there's no foliage on it now

1073
00:44:29,079 --> 00:44:34,160
anymore so I could do it now or I could

1074
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:37,318
do it in January or February as long as

1075
00:44:34,159 --> 00:44:40,759
it's not freezing you can do it so I do

1076
00:44:37,318 --> 00:44:42,960
it twice I'll do it in

1077
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:45,040
dorcy because I see the branching

1078
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:47,000
structure and I can see what I want and

1079
00:44:45,039 --> 00:44:49,318
what I what is crossing is okay what

1080
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:52,159
Crossing is not and then I'll do it

1081
00:44:49,318 --> 00:44:54,400
again in July and I do it in July

1082
00:44:52,159 --> 00:44:56,558
because especially Lacy leaf maples turn

1083
00:44:54,400 --> 00:45:00,000
into big mopads they turn into to

1084
00:44:56,559 --> 00:45:03,280
mushrooms and it's like what a blob and

1085
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,239
I uplight mine at night and so when you

1086
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:08,400
uplight it you can't even see it because

1087
00:45:05,239 --> 00:45:11,159
it's just like purple it's just a blob

1088
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:13,519
it looks like a gumdrop so what I do is

1089
00:45:11,159 --> 00:45:16,399
in July I go through and I window it and

1090
00:45:13,519 --> 00:45:18,599
I take out branches so I can see the

1091
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:21,280
trunk and see the branching structure

1092
00:45:18,599 --> 00:45:24,039
and see the uplight that I have on it at

1093
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:27,000
night so it actually gives me some

1094
00:45:24,039 --> 00:45:28,558
texture so I pruned twice

1095
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,960
okay I prune him in dormy and then I

1096
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:32,839
prune in July after the grow

1097
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:36,280
surge

1098
00:45:32,838 --> 00:45:39,838
okay yes while you're talking about lewe

1099
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:40,920
Maples what on M the the branches on the

1100
00:45:39,838 --> 00:45:43,639
end are

1101
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:45,240
dying what's causing branches on the end

1102
00:45:43,639 --> 00:45:48,639
of as Japanese maple are dying what's

1103
00:45:45,239 --> 00:45:51,239
causing it often Japanese

1104
00:45:48,639 --> 00:45:53,679
maples kill parts of it because there's

1105
00:45:51,239 --> 00:45:55,519
so much shade and so you might have

1106
00:45:53,679 --> 00:45:57,838
little Twigs little branches that are

1107
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:59,358
dying is that what it is yeah usually at

1108
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:00,838
the lots of and you can tell the color

1109
00:45:59,358 --> 00:46:03,440
of the wood is different isn't it it's a

1110
00:46:00,838 --> 00:46:04,960
light brown it's white I you can go

1111
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,838
through and just forget even using your

1112
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:10,920
shears you can just break them off with

1113
00:46:06,838 --> 00:46:13,119
your fingers and do that um so Japanese

1114
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:15,519
maples Lacy leaf maples are susceptible

1115
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:17,680
to crowding themselves out and shade

1116
00:46:15,519 --> 00:46:19,358
again another reason to prune in Fe in

1117
00:46:17,679 --> 00:46:21,118
July because you're trying to let light

1118
00:46:19,358 --> 00:46:23,480
in let light in let light in you'll get

1119
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:26,680
less Dy back so that's a good time to do

1120
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:29,358
it they do get verticillium which is a

1121
00:46:26,679 --> 00:46:31,679
fungal disease which is in the plant and

1122
00:46:29,358 --> 00:46:35,558
it will take out a major

1123
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:37,919
Branch or a major branch and if you have

1124
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:40,119
that it's probably going to May kill the

1125
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:42,200
tree trees can live with it but they

1126
00:46:40,119 --> 00:46:43,920
become pretty unsightly and so you'll

1127
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:45,558
probably have to take it out take the

1128
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,720
take out some of the soil and put in

1129
00:46:45,559 --> 00:46:48,319
something that's resistant to

1130
00:46:46,719 --> 00:46:49,639
verticillium which there are which would

1131
00:46:48,318 --> 00:46:51,838
not be a Japanese

1132
00:46:49,639 --> 00:46:55,558
maple so it just depends on what's going

1133
00:46:51,838 --> 00:46:57,318
on there so so let's go back to pruning

1134
00:46:55,559 --> 00:47:00,119
G General and pruning

1135
00:46:57,318 --> 00:47:02,960
trees you know there's there's two types

1136
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:04,920
of cuts in the world oh this is a great

1137
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:08,760
one I brought in there's a heading a

1138
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:10,358
heading cut where if I were to tip this

1139
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:12,440
this would be a heading cut right I

1140
00:47:10,358 --> 00:47:14,880
would tip it and it would respond by

1141
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:17,679
going right that's a heading cut a

1142
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:19,800
thinning cut is where I have a branch

1143
00:47:17,679 --> 00:47:22,719
and I take this entire Branch back to

1144
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:25,200
the point of origin if I do thinning

1145
00:47:22,719 --> 00:47:26,519
cuts it invigorates the rest of the

1146
00:47:25,199 --> 00:47:29,199
whole plan

1147
00:47:26,519 --> 00:47:30,559
if I do heading Cuts I get a grow surge

1148
00:47:29,199 --> 00:47:34,118
right from where I

1149
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:36,359
cut and so what should be your goal with

1150
00:47:34,119 --> 00:47:39,358
fruit trees and many other trees in your

1151
00:47:36,358 --> 00:47:41,838
landscape it should be the words lighten

1152
00:47:39,358 --> 00:47:43,880
air keep that Mantra in your head

1153
00:47:41,838 --> 00:47:47,440
lighten air lighten air lighten air

1154
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:50,960
meaning you are doing most of your Cuts

1155
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:52,240
will be thinning Cuts most of your Cuts

1156
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:54,720
will be thinning where you'll take the

1157
00:47:52,239 --> 00:47:56,959
branch back to the point of origin

1158
00:47:54,719 --> 00:47:59,799
evergreens

1159
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:02,400
um specifically what type of Evergreen

1160
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:05,920
well just name them I thought like

1161
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:08,760
Douglas fur yeah huge ones so those are

1162
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:10,720
going to be thinning Cuts huge Douglas

1163
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:12,240
Furs you would you would be do you

1164
00:48:10,719 --> 00:48:15,919
taking the branch back to the point of

1165
00:48:12,239 --> 00:48:19,799
origin say you wanted to make it less

1166
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:22,119
less prone to just thin it and lower a

1167
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:26,519
bit lowering a bit you have to be

1168
00:48:22,119 --> 00:48:28,519
careful in topping a tree lower a bit is

1169
00:48:26,519 --> 00:48:30,639
okay if it's a young tree if it's a big

1170
00:48:28,519 --> 00:48:32,719
old tree and we lowered it you know it's

1171
00:48:30,639 --> 00:48:36,358
100 feet tall and we lowered it by 30

1172
00:48:32,719 --> 00:48:38,679
feet that'd be topping right and Topping

1173
00:48:36,358 --> 00:48:41,799
let's talk topping for a second topping

1174
00:48:38,679 --> 00:48:44,799
is a detrimental practice to the tree

1175
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:47,079
because when you've got a tree that's

1176
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:50,160
100 feet

1177
00:48:47,079 --> 00:48:52,920
tall it's got this big old tree and this

1178
00:48:50,159 --> 00:48:56,039
big old Tree stores a lot of food in its

1179
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:58,358
root system a lot of food in in its root

1180
00:48:56,039 --> 00:49:01,159
system and it has an apical Marist stem

1181
00:48:58,358 --> 00:49:03,558
and it's growing all this way by cutting

1182
00:49:01,159 --> 00:49:05,719
the tree right here number one it

1183
00:49:03,559 --> 00:49:08,040
doesn't have any branch collar to heal

1184
00:49:05,719 --> 00:49:12,439
over and number

1185
00:49:08,039 --> 00:49:14,079
two the roots starve because of lack of

1186
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:15,480
nutrients because all these leaves

1187
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:17,920
you've taken off a third of the plant

1188
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:19,318
and all these leaves uh can't feed the

1189
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:21,159
root system so you start to get root

1190
00:49:19,318 --> 00:49:23,880
death so you start to get fungal growth

1191
00:49:21,159 --> 00:49:26,239
in The Roots so the tree becomes

1192
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:28,760
unstable so I often tell people if the

1193
00:49:26,239 --> 00:49:30,879
tree is a problem tree to you then take

1194
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:34,359
it out and put in something that's

1195
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:37,240
that's not as a problem Bush you know

1196
00:49:34,358 --> 00:49:39,639
huge okay it's higher in this roof and

1197
00:49:37,239 --> 00:49:43,838
it's sort of bushy and it kind of goes

1198
00:49:39,639 --> 00:49:45,639
up over the top of my head which is and

1199
00:49:43,838 --> 00:49:48,199
it's not a Douglas fur it's just a con

1200
00:49:45,639 --> 00:49:51,400
another conif fur another Evergreen it's

1201
00:49:48,199 --> 00:49:54,399
like a Hanoi okay like a hokei Cypress

1202
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:57,000
like a hokei Cyprus so you can I got a

1203
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:59,318
thin or something say the snow gets on

1204
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:02,480
it a lot and if it gets and it gets too

1205
00:49:59,318 --> 00:50:04,000
tall sometimes you know we can we can

1206
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:06,639
teach you out of a book all this stuff

1207
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,039
about why to not top a tree like a hokei

1208
00:50:06,639 --> 00:50:10,159
Cypress next to your house and then you

1209
00:50:08,039 --> 00:50:12,880
say but it gets in the gutter and it's

1210
00:50:10,159 --> 00:50:15,558
really annoying and I need to lower it

1211
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:18,640
or I need to open it up so you can drop

1212
00:50:15,559 --> 00:50:21,280
crotch it drop crotch is where you

1213
00:50:18,639 --> 00:50:24,039
basically if there's a branch coming out

1214
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:27,280
here and a branch coming out here you

1215
00:50:24,039 --> 00:50:30,719
can take it to this Branch right here

1216
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:32,680
and let this one take over okay you can

1217
00:50:30,719 --> 00:50:35,199
also reduce this one a little bit and

1218
00:50:32,679 --> 00:50:39,000
reduce that one when you get a big old

1219
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:40,519
tree that big old shrub which is turning

1220
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:43,838
into a tree because it's up to your

1221
00:50:40,519 --> 00:50:46,119
gutters and stuff like that um you can

1222
00:50:43,838 --> 00:50:48,599
remove branches back to their origin you

1223
00:50:46,119 --> 00:50:50,559
can remove the top back to a branch a

1224
00:50:48,599 --> 00:50:52,798
strong Branch that's going out there

1225
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:55,599
what you want to avoid doing little

1226
00:50:52,798 --> 00:50:58,559
green berries on it sometimes okay what

1227
00:50:55,599 --> 00:51:01,760
you want to avoid doing is shearing it

1228
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:03,760
okay you want to have somebody reduce it

1229
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:05,799
so that when they're done with it you go

1230
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:08,280
wow that just looks a little

1231
00:51:05,798 --> 00:51:09,759
smaller instead of whoa you really

1232
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:12,119
pruned that didn't

1233
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:13,720
you those are two different reactions

1234
00:51:12,119 --> 00:51:16,720
and there's no reason why you can't take

1235
00:51:13,719 --> 00:51:20,679
that Conifer back have someone take it

1236
00:51:16,719 --> 00:51:24,358
down the roots as big as r as you the

1237
00:51:20,679 --> 00:51:26,838
root is might be time for a stump

1238
00:51:24,358 --> 00:51:29,519
grinder

1239
00:51:26,838 --> 00:51:31,318
tree yeah it might be time for a tree so

1240
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:33,159
that you know we really have no options

1241
00:51:31,318 --> 00:51:34,960
your options are to I mean you have

1242
00:51:33,159 --> 00:51:37,598
several options but it's just a matter

1243
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:40,599
of what do I want to do you can thin it

1244
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:44,359
you can lower it you want it to look

1245
00:51:40,599 --> 00:51:46,680
nice for you still yeah and so get

1246
00:51:44,358 --> 00:51:48,440
someone who's trained someone who maybe

1247
00:51:46,679 --> 00:51:50,480
a certified Arborist somebody who knows

1248
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:53,559
what they're doing as opposed to someone

1249
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:55,079
who's the cheapest that's the problem my

1250
00:51:53,559 --> 00:51:56,079
neighborhood is full of people that are

1251
00:51:55,079 --> 00:51:59,200
the

1252
00:51:56,079 --> 00:52:01,200
cheapest and I look around and I go wow

1253
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:03,879
they've just pruned all their heaths

1254
00:52:01,199 --> 00:52:05,199
funny they're going to bloom in the fall

1255
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:07,760
and in the winter and they've just

1256
00:52:05,199 --> 00:52:09,719
sheared everything or what they did to

1257
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:12,040
my next door neighbor this was done by a

1258
00:52:09,719 --> 00:52:13,279
service and they lolly popped all of her

1259
00:52:12,039 --> 00:52:15,639
fruit

1260
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:17,920
trees and I see this and she does it

1261
00:52:15,639 --> 00:52:19,960
every year so I think you got to get

1262
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:21,639
people who know what they're doing and

1263
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:23,838
who are professionals you pay a little

1264
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:25,440
more for them you do but you're going to

1265
00:52:23,838 --> 00:52:26,480
have you're going to be happier because

1266
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:28,039
there's no reason why that tree that

1267
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:30,039
you're talking to the corner could

1268
00:52:28,039 --> 00:52:31,279
probably still look really nice with

1269
00:52:30,039 --> 00:52:34,039
someone knowing what they're doing and

1270
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:36,599
how to prune it you could reduce it um

1271
00:52:34,039 --> 00:52:38,838
I've reduced plants easily in

1272
00:52:36,599 --> 00:52:40,720
half and have them still well I can't

1273
00:52:38,838 --> 00:52:43,358
see it so I don't know but you know you

1274
00:52:40,719 --> 00:52:46,879
can reduce it significantly so that it

1275
00:52:43,358 --> 00:52:50,480
still would look good okay other

1276
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:52,000
questions at all thank you yeah one of

1277
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:55,318
the things I wanted

1278
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:59,760
to getting late am I okay are we okay

1279
00:52:55,318 --> 00:53:00,838
okay okay time wise okay I mean I think

1280
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:03,079
I'm guessing people probably have

1281
00:53:00,838 --> 00:53:07,759
questions about rendance yep I don't

1282
00:53:03,079 --> 00:53:10,640
know that's a popular PL okay so let me

1283
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:12,200
um let me end with a couple things and

1284
00:53:10,639 --> 00:53:13,838
then we can go from question to question

1285
00:53:12,199 --> 00:53:16,118
to question

1286
00:53:13,838 --> 00:53:17,639
um one of the you know one of the things

1287
00:53:16,119 --> 00:53:20,119
that's on here before I get into this

1288
00:53:17,639 --> 00:53:22,318
one is right plant right place isn't

1289
00:53:20,119 --> 00:53:23,480
that the truth you know you want to

1290
00:53:22,318 --> 00:53:27,838
think about

1291
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:29,798
okay before I buy something before I

1292
00:53:27,838 --> 00:53:32,119
plant something how big is this going to

1293
00:53:29,798 --> 00:53:33,679
get how big is this going to get what's

1294
00:53:32,119 --> 00:53:37,440
its maturity going to be and can I

1295
00:53:33,679 --> 00:53:39,078
handle that you know um I love you know

1296
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:42,159
Ted said I wrote a book well I I really

1297
00:53:39,079 --> 00:53:45,760
had a good time writing page 15

1298
00:53:42,159 --> 00:53:48,358
because it shows that in your mind's eye

1299
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:50,520
you have this Garden in your mind of

1300
00:53:48,358 --> 00:53:52,920
what you wanted to look

1301
00:53:50,519 --> 00:53:55,920
like but when we plant

1302
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:57,838
it it looks like this

1303
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:59,639
and I just did a new Garden installation

1304
00:53:57,838 --> 00:54:01,759
in my yard in my own

1305
00:53:59,639 --> 00:54:05,159
garden and I

1306
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:08,760
thought wow looks so

1307
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:11,798
bare I I can't wait for five years it's

1308
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:12,920
gonna because it needs to grow in now my

1309
00:54:11,798 --> 00:54:14,920
daughter on the other hand living in

1310
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:18,039
Woodville I went to her house a couple

1311
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:20,798
weeks ago for dinner and she's got into

1312
00:54:18,039 --> 00:54:24,199
plants all of a sudden and man they were

1313
00:54:20,798 --> 00:54:25,719
so close together I said well you know

1314
00:54:24,199 --> 00:54:27,798
these are really going to grow and she

1315
00:54:25,719 --> 00:54:29,000
said I know what you're thinking and I

1316
00:54:27,798 --> 00:54:31,798
know what you're going to say I'm

1317
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:36,318
planning on moving every other

1318
00:54:31,798 --> 00:54:38,400
plant I said perfect I love your garden

1319
00:54:36,318 --> 00:54:40,759
it looks so good all the colors all the

1320
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:43,200
textures everything was

1321
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:45,319
beautiful in three

1322
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:47,598
years she's going to have to be moving

1323
00:54:45,318 --> 00:54:49,239
every other plant she said I I'm I'm

1324
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:52,318
ready I hear you I hear what you're

1325
00:54:49,239 --> 00:54:54,919
saying I thought well you know she's

1326
00:54:52,318 --> 00:54:56,798
young she's 30 yeah I mean why not I

1327
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:58,559
could I could do that too at my age I'm

1328
00:54:56,798 --> 00:55:00,000
thinking oh I don't want to do that I

1329
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:01,519
look at mine and just think oh I hope I

1330
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,440
live long enough to see this thing fill

1331
00:55:01,519 --> 00:55:08,119
in you know that kind of a thing so

1332
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:11,240
anyway so right plant right place um

1333
00:55:08,119 --> 00:55:12,760
only that oh yeah this I want to I want

1334
00:55:11,239 --> 00:55:16,519
to I brought this in

1335
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:18,760
specifically um this is a pear tree okay

1336
00:55:16,519 --> 00:55:22,159
what do you

1337
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:24,000
notice lyans mosses lots of Spurs oh

1338
00:55:22,159 --> 00:55:26,798
good point so lots of

1339
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,760
Spurs and mosses how many of you have

1340
00:55:26,798 --> 00:55:30,838
lyans and mosses on your fruit trees

1341
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:35,160
anybody all right I'm here to I'm here

1342
00:55:30,838 --> 00:55:37,759
to make you unhappy um lyans and

1343
00:55:35,159 --> 00:55:41,038
mosses and there's and this is my

1344
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:43,160
observation my theory my conclusion of

1345
00:55:41,039 --> 00:55:44,559
listen to a lot of professionals on this

1346
00:55:43,159 --> 00:55:46,440
and there is some things that lyans and

1347
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:48,519
mosses actually leech nutrients into the

1348
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:50,599
soil um and there's some beneficials

1349
00:55:48,519 --> 00:55:53,079
there true but my observation has

1350
00:55:50,599 --> 00:55:55,400
noticed is that when you see lyans and

1351
00:55:53,079 --> 00:55:58,079
mosses first of all if you go to the

1352
00:55:55,400 --> 00:56:00,039
rainforest lyans and Mosses are why

1353
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:01,760
they're there because of environmental

1354
00:56:00,039 --> 00:56:04,240
they're there because of rain because of

1355
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:07,640
shade because of darkness and so we get

1356
00:56:04,239 --> 00:56:09,318
a lot of moss simply due to

1357
00:56:07,639 --> 00:56:12,078
exposure but what do you do when you

1358
00:56:09,318 --> 00:56:14,440
have a fruit tree that's in full sun hot

1359
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:16,760
blazing sun and it's covered with lyans

1360
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:18,039
and mosses you don't say well we live in

1361
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:21,119
the Pacific

1362
00:56:18,039 --> 00:56:23,400
Northwest and it's true but it's in full

1363
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:26,960
sun so why do we have lyans and

1364
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:29,519
mosses also look on your fruit trees and

1365
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:32,440
see if you have a lot of

1366
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:33,920
cracking on your branches like this is a

1367
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:37,000
thick branch and you've got this

1368
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:40,599
cracking going this

1369
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:42,440
way I studied under a professor and we

1370
00:56:40,599 --> 00:56:45,400
were talking about cracking of trees and

1371
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:47,039
I said I have cracking on my trees he

1372
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:51,559
said root

1373
00:56:47,039 --> 00:56:53,359
stress root stress root root stress root

1374
00:56:51,559 --> 00:56:55,359
stress that may have happened years ago

1375
00:56:53,358 --> 00:56:59,000
when it was transplanted maybe they

1376
00:56:55,358 --> 00:57:00,598
didn't spread the roots out maybe they

1377
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,440
kept it in the pot and then put the pot

1378
00:57:00,599 --> 00:57:06,359
in the ground and you know didn't score

1379
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:08,119
the root ball that May 20 years later be

1380
00:57:06,358 --> 00:57:10,000
causing stress because the roots are

1381
00:57:08,119 --> 00:57:12,920
actually kind of girdling each

1382
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:14,920
other well my theory on this is lyans

1383
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:17,760
and Mosses are a sign of

1384
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:21,480
stress they're a sign of stress of the

1385
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:25,400
tree it could be that root stress it

1386
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:27,280
could be soil compaction it could be

1387
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:30,039
I took out a tree yesterday I took this

1388
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:34,599
tree out yesterday and one of the

1389
00:57:30,039 --> 00:57:37,119
problems was and I did this is that I

1390
00:57:34,599 --> 00:57:38,440
mounded don't you hate when that happens

1391
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:39,599
I know it's like I can't get it off I

1392
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:41,639
can't get it

1393
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:45,079
off

1394
00:57:41,639 --> 00:57:47,318
so what I what I did on this

1395
00:57:45,079 --> 00:57:49,359
tree I hadn't thought about what I did

1396
00:57:47,318 --> 00:57:52,358
on this tree I just did it it looks

1397
00:57:49,358 --> 00:57:54,400
pretty though it does look pretty yeah

1398
00:57:52,358 --> 00:57:58,400
it didn't produce fruit at all this year

1399
00:57:54,400 --> 00:58:00,400
okay so what it did I put on a foot of

1400
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:03,240
chips why because I had to get rid of

1401
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:04,798
them and because there was lots of

1402
00:58:03,239 --> 00:58:05,519
reasons but I put a foot of chips on

1403
00:58:04,798 --> 00:58:09,679
this

1404
00:58:05,519 --> 00:58:11,280
tree you should have on your trees at

1405
00:58:09,679 --> 00:58:12,679
the base of your trees you should have

1406
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:16,400
what's called trunk

1407
00:58:12,679 --> 00:58:19,318
flare right trees have a trunk flare

1408
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:22,318
this tree the chips are up to

1409
00:58:19,318 --> 00:58:25,079
here it responded this year by producing

1410
00:58:22,318 --> 00:58:28,639
no fruit by getting rust which it never

1411
00:58:25,079 --> 00:58:32,400
got rust it's it's a tree that's

1412
00:58:28,639 --> 00:58:34,759
probably 50 60 years old and was

1413
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:37,358
terribly butchered by a previous

1414
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:40,799
owner so the tree has been stressed and

1415
00:58:37,358 --> 00:58:43,558
has had lyans and mosses on it for

1416
00:58:40,798 --> 00:58:46,519
years and so I made a decision you know

1417
00:58:43,559 --> 00:58:48,200
look at you you're such a mess and I

1418
00:58:46,519 --> 00:58:50,599
compounded it by adding all those chips

1419
00:58:48,199 --> 00:58:54,399
on there I think it's time for a new

1420
00:58:50,599 --> 00:58:55,680
tree see you so he's now took off ground

1421
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:57,039
level

1422
00:58:55,679 --> 00:58:58,519
you know and I'm very happy with all the

1423
00:58:57,039 --> 00:59:01,000
light I have there now it's like wow

1424
00:58:58,519 --> 00:59:03,759
that's really much nicer so but when you

1425
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:06,838
see lyans and mosses on trees that are

1426
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:09,280
in full sun think

1427
00:59:06,838 --> 00:59:12,000
stress so then what does that mean what

1428
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:14,680
can I do for it well you can mulch it

1429
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:17,000
with chips arborous chips you can add

1430
00:59:14,679 --> 00:59:18,679
some organic fertilizer to it but if

1431
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:21,079
you're putting chips don't put a foot of

1432
00:59:18,679 --> 00:59:23,759
chips you know we're talking a couple

1433
00:59:21,079 --> 00:59:25,480
inches that's enough yes I was just

1434
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:28,799
going to say the like

1435
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:30,519
don't really hurt nope they you know

1436
00:59:28,798 --> 00:59:32,358
some people are concerned oh it's it's

1437
00:59:30,519 --> 00:59:33,798
killing the plant right I better put

1438
00:59:32,358 --> 00:59:36,598
some dorment oil on it because it'll

1439
00:59:33,798 --> 00:59:38,119
kill the lyans and mosses no you don't

1440
00:59:36,599 --> 00:59:39,880
need to do that the lyans and mosses

1441
00:59:38,119 --> 00:59:41,880
you're right they're not a parasite

1442
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:45,680
they're not a problem they're using

1443
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:48,200
they're my theory is that the pH of the

1444
00:59:45,679 --> 00:59:50,679
bark changes when the plant is under

1445
00:59:48,199 --> 00:59:52,199
stress providing a good environment for

1446
00:59:50,679 --> 00:59:55,480
these guys to

1447
00:59:52,199 --> 00:59:58,759
grow yes um I have a

1448
00:59:55,480 --> 01:00:02,318
and half of the tree has lens and the

1449
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:05,559
other half doesn't wow interesting why

1450
01:00:02,318 --> 01:00:06,599
is that I have no idea yeah um the older

1451
01:00:05,559 --> 01:00:09,400
you get the more comfortable you get

1452
01:00:06,599 --> 01:00:11,720
saying I have no idea um I probably

1453
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:13,960
would open it up and then thin it out I

1454
01:00:11,719 --> 01:00:16,358
would be aware I that you've got some

1455
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:18,639
really good observations in that half of

1456
01:00:16,358 --> 01:00:20,558
the tree is it what is that half towards

1457
01:00:18,639 --> 01:00:22,679
on the North side the half on the North

1458
01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:25,720
side oh that's a good indicator isn't it

1459
01:00:22,679 --> 01:00:28,358
because that's that's light so I think I

1460
01:00:25,719 --> 01:00:30,838
would try I would try to stabilize it

1461
01:00:28,358 --> 01:00:33,880
first I this during dormy I would

1462
01:00:30,838 --> 01:00:35,759
probably take out a third of the plant

1463
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:38,318
lighten air those those hazelnuts is a

1464
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:41,240
contorted one no oh it's just a regular

1465
01:00:38,318 --> 01:00:43,199
a native okay it's a native one oh

1466
01:00:41,239 --> 01:00:48,318
that's really interesting um is it

1467
01:00:43,199 --> 01:00:49,639
really thick no um it's real open okay

1468
01:00:48,318 --> 01:00:51,279
so it's real open so therefore it's not

1469
01:00:49,639 --> 01:00:54,879
going to be a lighten air then go to the

1470
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:58,400
soil what's going on in the soil dry dry

1471
01:00:54,880 --> 01:01:00,680
okay so I might try I might try mulching

1472
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:03,599
with orborous chips um I might try

1473
01:01:00,679 --> 01:01:05,798
adding some organic fertilizer I've done

1474
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:08,640
chips okay and nothing

1475
01:01:05,798 --> 01:01:11,798
still interesting yeah could that be a

1476
01:01:08,639 --> 01:01:14,400
vascular issue like a a wil something

1477
01:01:11,798 --> 01:01:16,318
are are all the leaves coming out normal

1478
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:19,760
when they come out looks like it's dying

1479
01:01:16,318 --> 01:01:22,079
on that side oh interesting and it it

1480
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:24,799
throws suckers right and I've been

1481
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:27,079
cutting the suckers off right I didn't

1482
01:01:24,798 --> 01:01:29,318
know if that was doing no I think that's

1483
01:01:27,079 --> 01:01:31,400
okay wow I don't know I think I'd end up

1484
01:01:29,318 --> 01:01:32,358
having I I would almost want to I don't

1485
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:34,079
know whe there something's going on in

1486
01:01:32,358 --> 01:01:35,519
the root system or if something's going

1487
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:37,559
on the top

1488
01:01:35,519 --> 01:01:41,400
growth I probably would cut out the

1489
01:01:37,559 --> 01:01:44,480
affected areas and get rid of them off

1490
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:47,480
site anything else

1491
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:51,679
yes

1492
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:53,838
good said feu

1493
01:01:51,679 --> 01:01:56,000
okay great question and I brought a

1494
01:01:53,838 --> 01:01:57,000
raspberry over here for that very reason

1495
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,559
cuz I was hoping we would talk

1496
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,599
raspberries and then I forgot so thanks

1497
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:02,200
for bringing this up the first question

1498
01:02:00,599 --> 01:02:05,039
you have to ask is are they ever bearing

1499
01:02:02,199 --> 01:02:07,480
raspberries or are they single crop what

1500
01:02:05,039 --> 01:02:09,160
are they well I'm not sure I know the

1501
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:11,440
difference perfect I was hoping you'd

1502
01:02:09,159 --> 01:02:13,199
say that thank you I'll pay you later

1503
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:15,798
for that one that was that was really

1504
01:02:13,199 --> 01:02:18,558
what is the difference okay so this is

1505
01:02:15,798 --> 01:02:20,880
bearing fruit right now isn't it this is

1506
01:02:18,559 --> 01:02:23,200
considered an everbearing raspberry

1507
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:27,119
everbearing raspberries produce fruit

1508
01:02:23,199 --> 01:02:29,798
twice a year they produce fruit on new

1509
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:32,798
canes coming up that bloom in the summer

1510
01:02:29,798 --> 01:02:35,119
and produce fruit in the fall then if I

1511
01:02:32,798 --> 01:02:38,440
cut this back because the Top's going to

1512
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:40,599
die down this same cane will produce

1513
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:43,960
fruit in

1514
01:02:40,599 --> 01:02:46,519
June and then that cane will die so

1515
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:47,639
raspberry roots are perennial the canes

1516
01:02:46,519 --> 01:02:51,159
are

1517
01:02:47,639 --> 01:02:53,278
bional meaning they they they all canes

1518
01:02:51,159 --> 01:02:55,920
of raspberries live for two years and

1519
01:02:53,278 --> 01:02:59,278
then they die so let's talk single crop

1520
01:02:55,920 --> 01:03:01,079
raspberry real quickly um if we're okay

1521
01:02:59,278 --> 01:03:04,278
on time I don't want to have you guys

1522
01:03:01,079 --> 01:03:07,318
say get out of here um I think we're

1523
01:03:04,278 --> 01:03:09,440
done with him so let's HCK

1524
01:03:07,318 --> 01:03:12,358
raspberries let's suck single crop

1525
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:14,960
raspberries such as what such as Meer

1526
01:03:12,358 --> 01:03:17,278
such as tuline tuline is by far my most

1527
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:19,960
favorite raspberry um the fruit is

1528
01:03:17,278 --> 01:03:22,039
quality of the fruit is incredible so it

1529
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:24,358
grows its first year that's called the

1530
01:03:22,039 --> 01:03:26,680
primacan and it does nothing it just

1531
01:03:24,358 --> 01:03:29,880
grows it might grow 6 feet it doesn't

1532
01:03:26,679 --> 01:03:32,798
Bloom doesn't fruit doesn't do anything

1533
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:34,240
okay so it might produce all these canes

1534
01:03:32,798 --> 01:03:35,798
coming up here you've got all these

1535
01:03:34,239 --> 01:03:38,558
canes about 18

1536
01:03:35,798 --> 01:03:40,639
in and they're like

1537
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:43,680
this and this is

1538
01:03:40,639 --> 01:03:47,159
tuline I put in a trellis which is a 4x4

1539
01:03:43,679 --> 01:03:51,519
trellis I put a cross on it I put in a

1540
01:03:47,159 --> 01:03:53,278
4x4 post and a 2x4 cross and I put wires

1541
01:03:51,519 --> 01:03:56,519
between them so it looks like a Clos

1542
01:03:53,278 --> 01:03:58,400
line and then in the time of year to do

1543
01:03:56,519 --> 01:04:00,639
your pruning is going to be

1544
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:03,039
February okay February is when I'm going

1545
01:04:00,639 --> 01:04:06,038
to prune my single crop what I'm going

1546
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:07,559
to do is I'm going to take these guys

1547
01:04:06,039 --> 01:04:09,920
and I'm going to bend them here and I'm

1548
01:04:07,559 --> 01:04:12,440
going to tie them take this one bend it

1549
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:16,119
here and tie them take it here bend it

1550
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:18,599
and tie it okay then I take this

1551
01:04:16,119 --> 01:04:21,358
one bend it tie it

1552
01:04:18,599 --> 01:04:23,440
here take this one bend it tie it here

1553
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:26,400
take this one bend it tie it here looks

1554
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:29,039
great in a picture it actually does work

1555
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:31,278
um same thing maybe I only have one on

1556
01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:33,359
this one CU it only had one cane maybe

1557
01:04:31,278 --> 01:04:35,559
this one has two and I tie it here and I

1558
01:04:33,358 --> 01:04:37,679
tie it here now notice when I tie it

1559
01:04:35,559 --> 01:04:41,278
what am I doing I'm tipping

1560
01:04:37,679 --> 01:04:43,358
it that's really key you want to tip it

1561
01:04:41,278 --> 01:04:45,960
you want to bring this thing over it may

1562
01:04:43,358 --> 01:04:48,759
go all the way down to here you tip it

1563
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:50,920
even if it only goes to here I tip it

1564
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:53,599
why because that takes that hormone out

1565
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:57,200
of the apical Mar stem and causes fruit

1566
01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:59,200
to go here here here here here here here

1567
01:04:57,199 --> 01:05:02,399
here here so you get fruit all the way

1568
01:04:59,199 --> 01:05:04,919
along here and I want my trellis to be I

1569
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:07,440
like to be have them six feet because

1570
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:09,519
what happens they come out about 18

1571
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:11,559
inches and so you say well that's too

1572
01:05:09,519 --> 01:05:13,639
high for me it won't be once these guys

1573
01:05:11,559 --> 01:05:17,400
start producing fruit coming down this

1574
01:05:13,639 --> 01:05:19,759
way okay so now they produce fruit year

1575
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:21,798
two now you're in your second year right

1576
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:23,079
they produce fruit while they are

1577
01:05:21,798 --> 01:05:26,000
producing

1578
01:05:23,079 --> 01:05:27,640
fruit you have new canes coming up all

1579
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:30,880
over the place I try to keep them inside

1580
01:05:27,639 --> 01:05:32,960
my box keep them inside my box you got

1581
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:35,480
new canes coming up that's next year's

1582
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:37,278
fruit keep those canes growing keep them

1583
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:39,119
growing keep them protected they're

1584
01:05:37,278 --> 01:05:41,159
growing they're growing they're

1585
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:44,000
growing now in

1586
01:05:41,159 --> 01:05:45,318
February and I always tie mine with jute

1587
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:47,719
so that I can just cut them and then

1588
01:05:45,318 --> 01:05:49,558
they drop off cut and they drop off I

1589
01:05:47,719 --> 01:05:53,239
take these guys all the way down to the

1590
01:05:49,559 --> 01:05:54,760
ground so I remove all these old canes

1591
01:05:53,239 --> 01:05:59,118
that produce fruit

1592
01:05:54,760 --> 01:06:01,160
and then I tie the new ones over here so

1593
01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:03,599
every year in February I'm cutting it

1594
01:06:01,159 --> 01:06:06,239
down and then I'm

1595
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:08,079
reattaching now if you're like me as

1596
01:06:06,239 --> 01:06:10,118
soon as I'm done

1597
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:12,318
fruiting as soon as I'm done fruiting

1598
01:06:10,119 --> 01:06:15,200
like in September I like to take out the

1599
01:06:12,318 --> 01:06:17,278
old Prime canes why because I like to

1600
01:06:15,199 --> 01:06:19,838
give the other one space I like to give

1601
01:06:17,278 --> 01:06:23,358
the other one some room so I will prune

1602
01:06:19,838 --> 01:06:26,038
them um I'll prune them also at at that

1603
01:06:23,358 --> 01:06:28,440
time of in as well so this is a single

1604
01:06:26,039 --> 01:06:31,278
crop if it's an

1605
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:33,639
everbearing like this

1606
01:06:31,278 --> 01:06:35,960
guy what I like to do you're not going

1607
01:06:33,639 --> 01:06:37,278
to want to hear this I cut him to the

1608
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:39,679
ground every

1609
01:06:37,278 --> 01:06:42,119
year I cut him to the ground every year

1610
01:06:39,679 --> 01:06:43,639
I still have a trellis like this and I

1611
01:06:42,119 --> 01:06:49,278
cut them the ground every year because

1612
01:06:43,639 --> 01:06:51,480
the taste of these in July is nothing

1613
01:06:49,278 --> 01:06:55,798
compared to

1614
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:57,639
tulines but in September October who is

1615
01:06:55,798 --> 01:07:00,759
complaining about the taste of these

1616
01:06:57,639 --> 01:07:02,838
it's a fresh raspberry and it tastes so

1617
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:05,640
good and I and this really came home

1618
01:07:02,838 --> 01:07:07,519
from me when I when I had five kids at

1619
01:07:05,639 --> 01:07:09,318
home and they were little kids and they

1620
01:07:07,519 --> 01:07:11,318
wanted dinner they want to hurry up you

1621
01:07:09,318 --> 01:07:13,759
know it's like go outside and eat

1622
01:07:11,318 --> 01:07:16,440
something just go pick something get out

1623
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:19,160
of the kitchen just go outside and eat

1624
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:21,720
get out of here just go eat something

1625
01:07:19,159 --> 01:07:24,679
they would never pick my everbearing

1626
01:07:21,719 --> 01:07:27,199
raspberries and I remember saying

1627
01:07:24,679 --> 01:07:28,879
I got two huge rows 75 ft long why

1628
01:07:27,199 --> 01:07:31,639
aren't you picking the everbearing

1629
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:33,720
they're like they don't even taste

1630
01:07:31,639 --> 01:07:35,598
good and then I started thinking they

1631
01:07:33,719 --> 01:07:38,480
don't even taste good so I did a real

1632
01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:42,640
taste test on the July of an everbearing

1633
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:44,240
versus July of a single crop holy smokes

1634
01:07:42,639 --> 01:07:47,278
it was such a difference why am I

1635
01:07:44,239 --> 01:07:49,959
wasting my time on these everbearing

1636
01:07:47,278 --> 01:07:51,960
however in August and September and

1637
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:54,920
October these everbearing are the best

1638
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:56,400
raspberries you'll ever have

1639
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:59,318
you don't have the others to compare it

1640
01:07:56,400 --> 01:08:01,240
to so that's why I like growing both I

1641
01:07:59,318 --> 01:08:03,599
don't commingle them because it's really

1642
01:08:01,239 --> 01:08:07,879
hard to tell which is which so I don't

1643
01:08:03,599 --> 01:08:09,838
commingle but A good rule of thumb is if

1644
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:10,960
you have a cane if you have you say well

1645
01:08:09,838 --> 01:08:13,358
I don't know whether I have everbearing

1646
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:15,079
or single crop if you're getting fruit

1647
01:08:13,358 --> 01:08:16,960
right now it's

1648
01:08:15,079 --> 01:08:19,278
everbearing if you're getting fruit on

1649
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:21,079
it then it's an everbearing raspberry

1650
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:22,719
because they do not produce fruit at

1651
01:08:21,079 --> 01:08:25,198
this time of year and notice the

1652
01:08:22,719 --> 01:08:27,719
position they're at the termin

1653
01:08:25,198 --> 01:08:28,960
that's an everbearing raspberry versus a

1654
01:08:27,719 --> 01:08:32,439
single

1655
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:35,198
crop okay so you don't Pro just a

1656
01:08:32,439 --> 01:08:36,759
portion of that I no and you could you

1657
01:08:35,198 --> 01:08:37,879
certainly could a lot of people who have

1658
01:08:36,759 --> 01:08:40,079
ever I've talked to people with ever

1659
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:42,400
bearing thing you learn with gardeners

1660
01:08:40,079 --> 01:08:43,838
is that you don't complain with you

1661
01:08:42,399 --> 01:08:44,759
don't you don't teach them how to do

1662
01:08:43,838 --> 01:08:47,000
anything because they're going to do

1663
01:08:44,759 --> 01:08:49,079
what they want to do anyway and I don't

1664
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:51,479
argue with success and I've had people

1665
01:08:49,079 --> 01:08:54,039
say I have ever bearing and they are the

1666
01:08:51,479 --> 01:08:56,519
best raspberries ever had perfect keep

1667
01:08:54,039 --> 01:08:58,960
growing them I'm not con I'm not here to

1668
01:08:56,520 --> 01:09:00,400
convince you but you certainly could if

1669
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:03,239
this was my everbearing and I know

1670
01:09:00,399 --> 01:09:05,920
people that do this in the spring they

1671
01:09:03,238 --> 01:09:07,718
just cut the tops off why because these

1672
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:10,000
die back to here and then these are

1673
01:09:07,719 --> 01:09:11,158
going to produce fruit these are all

1674
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,920
going to produce fruit and if you have a

1675
01:09:11,158 --> 01:09:15,559
variety of every brain that you love

1676
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:17,640
then manage it that way and that works

1677
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:20,960
out that works out fine so you just cut

1678
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:23,359
back to to a to a node right here it'll

1679
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:25,640
tell you have fruit you still have fruit

1680
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:27,359
below it'll it'll tell you in the spring

1681
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:29,199
it'll it'll actually die back during the

1682
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:31,359
winter and then you'll be able say oh

1683
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:34,000
it's dead to he oh it's dead to here and

1684
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:36,000
then you cut it what do you do about the

1685
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:38,880
fruit fly

1686
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:40,880
maggots well yeah there's a little

1687
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:42,359
there's a little fruit fly that's a

1688
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:45,679
problem with raspberries and so what I

1689
01:09:42,359 --> 01:09:47,520
do is I do traps I take a cottage cheese

1690
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:49,679
container and I drill holes in the side

1691
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:54,239
put the lid on it and I put in apple

1692
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:57,840
cider vinegar and one one drop drop of

1693
01:09:54,238 --> 01:10:00,718
dish soap and they go in those holes and

1694
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:02,319
they drown and the dish soap keeps them

1695
01:10:00,719 --> 01:10:04,158
so you mean on raspberries or you

1696
01:10:02,319 --> 01:10:06,759
talking about Apple

1697
01:10:04,158 --> 01:10:08,920
maggots Apple maggots another story so

1698
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:10,440
Apple maggots which which this was for

1699
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:13,319
me this was a great year for Apple

1700
01:10:10,439 --> 01:10:15,198
maggots meaning I didn't have any and

1701
01:10:13,319 --> 01:10:16,519
this was the first year that I took

1702
01:10:15,198 --> 01:10:19,000
Christmas

1703
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:20,960
balls of course you know I bought those

1704
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:24,800
little footy things that you can put

1705
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:27,520
them on and I thought I'm am retired and

1706
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:29,039
I don't have time for this I used to

1707
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:31,560
think well when I retire I'll have time

1708
01:10:29,039 --> 01:10:34,158
for that but now it's like this is a

1709
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:37,159
waste I am not doing this who gave me

1710
01:10:34,158 --> 01:10:38,839
these so now I take chry uh red

1711
01:10:37,158 --> 01:10:39,759
Christmas balls and I paint them with

1712
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:42,400
tangle

1713
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:46,039
foot and I hang them out four of them

1714
01:10:42,399 --> 01:10:49,839
per tree wow that worked great this year

1715
01:10:46,039 --> 01:10:53,479
the the the female um the female fly

1716
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:56,679
it's a fly and she sees the red and says

1717
01:10:53,479 --> 01:10:56,678
yeah yes Red

1718
01:10:57,719 --> 01:11:03,679
Apple and then can't go anywhere so she

1719
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:06,079
dies there because what she does is She

1720
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:07,640
lays her little ovap posor in the apple

1721
01:11:06,079 --> 01:11:10,679
and puts an egg in there and the egg

1722
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:12,719
hatches into a maggot which causes apple

1723
01:11:10,679 --> 01:11:15,359
maggot and that's why you don't want to

1724
01:11:12,719 --> 01:11:17,279
transport apple maggot fruit because the

1725
01:11:15,359 --> 01:11:19,639
Apple maggots are in there and then they

1726
01:11:17,279 --> 01:11:22,920
hatch and then they fly around they're a

1727
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:25,400
fly and so that's why I use bright red

1728
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:28,840
cheap Christmas balls paint it with

1729
01:11:25,399 --> 01:11:31,599
tangle foot hang them in your tree

1730
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:33,360
around tangle foot's a very you can buy

1731
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:34,840
it looks like rubber cement remember the

1732
01:11:33,359 --> 01:11:36,479
old rubber cement days in the black in

1733
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:39,400
the little glass thing and you paint it

1734
01:11:36,479 --> 01:11:40,919
on the on it and it's really sticky is

1735
01:11:39,399 --> 01:11:42,319
it in the garden department yeah it's in

1736
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:44,480
the garden department there's nothing

1737
01:11:42,319 --> 01:11:48,960
you can put in the soil to kill the

1738
01:11:44,479 --> 01:11:50,359
overwind over wi no cuz they're a fly so

1739
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:52,239
there's nothing in the soil you can put

1740
01:11:50,359 --> 01:11:53,880
in there because this fly you put in the

1741
01:11:52,238 --> 01:11:55,000
soil right around there number two two

1742
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:56,639
you're going to number one you're going

1743
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:59,119
to ingest the chemical that you just put

1744
01:11:56,639 --> 01:12:00,639
in the soil but number two the fly may

1745
01:11:59,119 --> 01:12:02,519
be coming from your neighbors or may be

1746
01:12:00,639 --> 01:12:05,359
coming from all around because it's a

1747
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:08,080
fly so it's not a maggot living in the

1748
01:12:05,359 --> 01:12:09,359
soil okay how long's it left how long

1749
01:12:08,079 --> 01:12:11,679
what do you have to do it every a year

1750
01:12:09,359 --> 01:12:13,639
tangle foot the balls oh once a year I

1751
01:12:11,679 --> 01:12:14,920
threw them all out now I throw them away

1752
01:12:13,639 --> 01:12:16,480
because they're too sticky they're too

1753
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:18,639
sticky and gross and I'm not going to

1754
01:12:16,479 --> 01:12:20,439
clean them and and the and the weather

1755
01:12:18,639 --> 01:12:22,639
has caused the red to come off and it's

1756
01:12:20,439 --> 01:12:24,119
just a gross mess so yes that would you

1757
01:12:22,639 --> 01:12:26,600
answer could

1758
01:12:24,119 --> 01:12:29,519
