welcome to the cannabis cultivation and

3
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:23,600
science podcast i'm your host

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,880
tad hussey of kiss organics this is the

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,240
podcast where we discuss

6
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:28,320
the cutting edge of growing from a

7
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:29,919
science-based perspective and drawn top

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,679
experts from around the industry to

9
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,920
share their wisdom and knowledge

10
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:35,439
our guest this week is jim barrett jim

11
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,280
has a bachelor's of science from the

12
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:38,000
auburn university in agricultural

13
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,600
services

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,119
a masters of science from auburn

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,359
university with an emphasis

16
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:45,839
on physiology of vegetable crops and a

17
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:46,558
phd from michigan state university with

18
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,120
an emphasis

19
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:50,799
on physiology of horticulture crops he

20
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:54,078
was a professor at the university of

21
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:55,919
florida from 1978 to 2016

22
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,280
with a focus on crop production in

23
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,039
controlled environments

24
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,120
a major component of his work was

25
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,679
evaluating plant growth hormones

26
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:05,518
also known as pgrs and developing new

27
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:06,478
application strategies for greenhouse

28
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,240
crops

29
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:09,920
after retiring from the university he

30
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:11,839
went on to run barrett horticultural

31
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,159
consulting for four years with a focus

32
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,640
on crop production and facility planning

33
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,640
for florida medical cannabis producers

34
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,320
he has since retired again and requested

35
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,680
that folks not attempt to contact him

36
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:23,519
but he kindly agreed to come on the

37
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,799
podcast to share some of his experience

38
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:26,560
around pgrs

39
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,159
and was originally recommended to me by

40
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,680
suzanne wainwright evans

41
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,960
i was grateful to catch up with them on

42
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,479
the phone and learn more about plant

43
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:34,078
growth hormones and regulators

44
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:36,078
and how they may impact crops like

45
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:37,919
cannabis as well as what risks may be

46
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:41,679
associated with their use

47
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:44,320
now on to the show hey jim well thanks

48
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,000
for coming on the show today

49
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:48,478
well thank you for inviting me i'm

50
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,319
looking forward to the discussion

51
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:52,078
yeah well can we start off by giving

52
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:56,239
listeners a little bit of your

53
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:56,239
background in the horticultural world

54
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:03,359
sure yeah i i'm a retired faculty member

55
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:04,078
from the university of florida spent

56
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:07,519
about

57
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:08,959
40 years there specializing in crops

58
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:10,318
that are grown in controlled

59
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,560
environments

60
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:14,639
either vegetables or a lot of the flower

61
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,800
crops

62
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:18,559
and one of the main things that i was

63
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,640
doing there was looking at plant growth

64
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,239
regulators that are real commonly used

65
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:25,359
in greenhouse crops

66
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:29,439
and looking at evaluating chemicals

67
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:32,800
evaluating formulations application

68
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:35,359
methods and procedures some of my

69
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,640
work there was directed at trying to

70
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,319
reduce

71
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:40,079
the amount of actual chemical that is

72
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:42,318
being used and sold

73
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,319
so that the chemical that was was being

74
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:46,000
used by the commercial growers

75
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:48,479
would be more efficient and there'd be

76
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,239
less of it being used less getting into

77
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:52,959
the environment

78
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,400
the last few years since i retired from

79
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,120
university of florida

80
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,439
i got involved in doing some consulting

81
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,680
in the cannabis

82
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:03,598
market in florida so i worked with some

83
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,080
of the growers there

84
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:07,839
in developing their culture for that

85
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,120
environment as well as designing

86
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,158
facilities

87
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,080
and that type of thing so now i'm i'm a

88
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:15,598
retired grandfather

89
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,360
yeah and i'd like to emphasize you are

90
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:19,280
now fully retired and you're you're

91
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,720
doing this out of your own generosity of

92
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,239
your time you're no longer

93
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:24,000
looking for consulting work and and

94
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,039
there won't be any contact information

95
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,158
for you

96
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:29,280
uh in the podcast section of this

97
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:30,400
podcast so

98
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,840
i'm gonna throw that out there for

99
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,840
listeners as well

100
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:38,158
and uh you know i want you to obviously

101
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,599
enjoy your time as a grandfather

102
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:43,439
so yeah that's really important

103
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:45,039
let's uh let's dive in talking about you

104
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:46,479
and you'd want to start talking a little

105
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:49,120
bit about some of the

106
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:49,679
the definitions and labeling around you

107
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,439
know

108
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,959
plant growth hormones and plant growth

109
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:54,158
regulators and and it sounds like we're

110
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,519
going to use those terms sort of

111
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:58,639
synonymously

112
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:02,000
in this in this podcast so um

113
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:05,839
yeah why don't we start there yeah yes

114
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,878
um the term plant growth regulator plant

115
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,158
growth regulators

116
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:13,199
is is a pretty broad term

117
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:15,438
and one of the things that's uh often

118
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:18,798
associated with plant growth regulators

119
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:22,240
is whether or not they are a pesticide

120
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:23,439
and so the term pesticide from the

121
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,280
federal government the pest

122
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:30,319
the epa pesticide is a legal issue

123
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:32,638
it's a legal term and so the plant

124
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:36,000
growth regulators

125
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:39,360
from epa standpoint they are

126
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,959
classified as pesticides so

127
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:46,319
in general in the you have

128
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:48,879
insecticides fungicides herbicides

129
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:49,839
and plant growth regulators that fall

130
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:53,120
under what they

131
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:55,119
describe as pesticides so

132
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,720
in general we often think of pesticides

133
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,319
and something you're trying to

134
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,919
chemical you're trying to kill something

135
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:01,839
well the plant growth regulators you're

136
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:03,758
not trying to do that you're trying to

137
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:06,159
you're doing something to regulate the

138
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,000
growth and

139
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,680
the evolution of the crop that you're

140
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,639
producing

141
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,720
so they from that standpoint as a user

142
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,720
you have to treat them differently

143
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,919
um and think about them they're

144
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,919
considerably

145
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:21,120
plant growth regulators are considerably

146
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:24,240
more difficult to

147
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:27,840
manage as a grower than

148
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:30,879
insecticides or fungicides

149
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:31,758
so that whether or not a plant growth

150
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:35,680
regulator

151
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:38,800
is a pesticide becomes a legal

152
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,000
issue and especially in the cannabis

153
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,038
market

154
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,120
it is a real issue

155
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:46,639
well every step back you're growing

156
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,319
tomatoes or

157
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:52,720
geraniums or poinsettias or something

158
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:53,839
the products that you use there whether

159
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,639
it's

160
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:57,519
an insecticide or a growth regulator

161
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,879
comes with a

162
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:03,680
federal label and so you can't use it

163
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:07,279
unless it has an epa-approved label

164
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:09,280
describing how it should be used

165
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:10,719
now of course with in the cannabis

166
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:14,318
market there's not

167
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:17,120
any federal regulations there and so

168
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,120
there are no

169
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:23,439
real pesticides with federal labels

170
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,639
for the cannabis market now it's

171
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:25,839
starting to evolve a little bit more

172
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,600
with help

173
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:29,758
just because of what's going on there

174
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,960
but primarily

175
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:36,080
uh for uh recreational or

176
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:37,680
municipal cannabis is regulated by

177
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:41,918
individual states

178
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:43,600
and uh

179
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:46,000
most people know what it's like it

180
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:49,759
varies so much from one state to another

181
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,959
what the state approves so

182
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:56,000
um it becomes a real

183
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:59,359
legal issue as to whether or not a pgr

184
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,240
can be used from a legal standpoint in

185
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,319
any given state or any given market so

186
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,199
that's sort of the legal

187
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:10,160
bank growth regulator situation it is

188
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:13,840
legally classified as a pesticide

189
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:16,240
now in the pgrs they're widely varied

190
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:17,839
uh there are you know several plant

191
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,598
hormones

192
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:25,119
um and the pgrs in general are either a

193
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:28,560
naturally occurring or a synthetic

194
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,598
plant hormone or a chemical that

195
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,478
regulates

196
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:33,598
one of the natural plant hormones or the

197
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:36,639
plant

198
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:38,159
um so that's the reason there's some

199
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,639
confusion about whether it should be

200
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,680
coral

201
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,160
hormones or not and then and we've sort

202
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,560
of just

203
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,800
evolved issues using term plant growth

204
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:50,240
regulators for a lot of them

205
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,400
um so we have

206
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,960
hormones like gibberellin natural

207
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:57,439
hormone in the plant

208
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:58,399
one the applica or one of the things

209
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:00,719
that gibberellin does

210
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:02,799
in the plant is causes stem elongation

211
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,800
it causes the plants to get larger

212
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,560
obviously in cannabis we must have a lot

213
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,919
of gibberellin in that plant because

214
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,560
they grow a lot

215
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:12,079
then there's a group of chemicals that

216
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,319
are synthetic

217
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:16,560
that interfere with the production of

218
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:19,199
gerberline in the plant

219
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,959
and so these are gibberellins synthesis

220
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,879
inhibitors

221
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:26,799
and that group of chemicals

222
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,319
if you put those on a plant it will make

223
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,240
the plant more compact

224
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,599
it reduces the amount of gibberellin in

225
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:36,000
the plant and so the plant is shorter

226
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,640
so a product like paclibutazole is in

227
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,879
that category

228
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:42,158
then you have other hormones like auxins

229
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:45,838
oxen

230
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:48,559
ia is the natural oxen helps

231
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:51,279
cuttings form roots and so it's pretty

232
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:54,799
common for us to use synthetic auxins

233
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:56,799
iba or naa those are products that

234
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:58,639
are chemicals that are a product like

235
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:02,399
dip and grow

236
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:06,399
to promote rooting on cuttings

237
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:10,000
cytokinin is another type of natural

238
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:13,200
plant hormone it's involved in

239
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,080
promoting lateral blood growth it's also

240
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,160
involved

241
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:21,759
in leaf dye back turning yellow

242
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:24,879
senescence of leaves and so

243
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:25,919
the cytokinin materials the synthetic

244
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:28,240
cytokinins

245
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:29,120
or the natural cytokinins that might be

246
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,480
found in

247
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:35,440
in something like seaweed extracts

248
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,480
um they will promote lateral blood

249
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,680
growth

250
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:42,159
uh or uh in some of the synthetic

251
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:44,559
materials like a

252
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:46,639
material that's called 6ba it's a

253
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:48,799
synthetic cytokinin

254
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:50,559
it reduces leaf yellowing so a plant

255
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:52,479
treated with that

256
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:54,239
the leaves stay longer they stay green

257
00:09:52,480 --> 00:10:00,800
longer

258
00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:00,799
um abscisic acid is a plant hormone that

259
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:07,679
is involved in causing leaves to

260
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:09,439
drop off it helps the plants go dormant

261
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:12,000
in the winter

262
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:15,120
and so exciting acid is something that

263
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,120
reduces growth

264
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,120
and there recently there are very few of

265
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,039
cyanic acids that are used in

266
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,039
commercial agriculture but recently

267
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:26,958
there is started being used

268
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:30,319
pretty widely of obstacle um

269
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:31,039
for use on grapes and some other crops

270
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,959
now

271
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:35,599
so that the grapes turn uh turn red or

272
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:38,239
ripen

273
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:41,360
uniformly and so that makes the harvest

274
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:44,639
easier so that's just an example of how

275
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:48,800
many of these plant growth regulators

276
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:52,399
are used on food crops

277
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:52,879
a um another one is ethylene ethylene is

278
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,720
a gas

279
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:56,159
it's a natural plant hormone produced by

280
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,000
the gap by the plant

281
00:10:56,159 --> 00:11:00,480
normally in response to some kind of

282
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,480
stress

283
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:06,479
and there there is uh synthetic products

284
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:09,679
uh one of

285
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,600
the depth of one is the name of one that

286
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:14,078
when treated when the plants are treated

287
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,759
with esophon it produces the ethylene

288
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:19,919
gas inside the plant

289
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:22,639
and then the plant responds like it is

290
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:24,000
responding to ethylene and the

291
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:26,639
interesting thing about

292
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,440
ethylene is just lots of lots of uses

293
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:30,000
for it

294
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,079
ethylene can be used to cause flowering

295
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,320
in for example pineapples almost all the

296
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:36,239
pineapples we consume in the u.s

297
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,399
the plant was treated with ethylene in

298
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,759
the field to get it to

299
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,799
set fruit almost all our tomatoes and

300
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:44,879
bananas

301
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:46,559
are treated with ethylene after they

302
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:49,919
were harvested to get them

303
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:52,319
to ripen uniformly

304
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:53,838
then there's another set of synthetic

305
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,600
materials

306
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:59,440
that block the action of ethylene either

307
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,879
the formation or the

308
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:05,440
action of ethylene in the plant

309
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:06,720
and some of these are used in the

310
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,720
cannabis industry

311
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:13,519
uh probably not legally but

312
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,639
we can talk about this a little bit more

313
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,679
later i think but

314
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:19,919
uh ethylene becomes an important uh

315
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:22,078
chemical to talk about very often then

316
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:25,278
there's some others uh jasminic acid is

317
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:27,919
one that's being researched quite a bit

318
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:27,919
you know in the

319
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,360
folks that are looking at plant hormones

320
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:36,000
across the board in all types of crops

321
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,879
so the term plant growth regulator

322
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,519
covers a wide base of

323
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:43,519
chemistry or actual chemicals and also a

324
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,560
wide base of what we're trying to do in

325
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,600
the plant

326
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:49,359
uh so it's pretty varied

327
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,639
so took a little time answering that

328
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,839
question but um

329
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:55,519
it's it's a it's a pretty complex issue

330
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,279
oh no that was great i mean i'm sure you

331
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,919
could there's college courses just on

332
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:01,120
this

333
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:02,319
topic i realize it's quite broad um

334
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,320
and there's a lot and we're obviously

335
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:07,600
not gonna be able to get into all of it

336
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:09,440
uh today but i would like to touch on

337
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,240
some of the highlights from

338
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,000
you know our conversations off air here

339
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,079
and one of the things i'd like to start

340
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
with because when i think of

341
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:20,638
plant growth regulators i mean in

342
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,000
cannabis i immediately go to

343
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:25,600
um paclobetrisol it's just it's the one

344
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,278
that everyone knows it's the one that

345
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,839
was most commonly used

346
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:30,320
uh people say you know i you can tell if

347
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:31,720
uh

348
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,519
if a plant has been treated with

349
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,120
paclobutrizol

350
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,799
can you talk a little bit about it just

351
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,278
as a general perspective

352
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:41,039
and then let's talk about how you know

353
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:43,120
in terms of how it affects a plant

354
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:44,399
just strictly from um you know

355
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,320
morphology per

356
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,159
a morphology aspect and then let's talk

357
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:52,959
a little bit about what's going on

358
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:52,958
uh possibly inside inside the plant

359
00:13:53,120 --> 00:14:00,320
uh sure yeah paclobutazole um

360
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:02,800
this is a product that i started working

361
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:05,920
with in about 1980 so i have a

362
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:09,519
long history with paclovicazole

363
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:12,479
there is a there and so paclobutazole

364
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:14,560
is a synthetic chemical that blocks the

365
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:19,199
production of gibberellin in the plant

366
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:23,278
so it it is an inhibitor of growth

367
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:24,479
um and in general uh pecleobutanol

368
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:27,039
there are several others in this

369
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:30,320
category uh unicontazole

370
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:32,639
is uh the molecular

371
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,519
structure is very very similar to peclet

372
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:37,440
dissolved

373
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:39,839
uh but you know contol is more active

374
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,270
there are others domenicide is in the

375
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,760
same

376
00:14:40,269 --> 00:14:45,039
[Music]

377
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:46,240
group of chemicals that block ga

378
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:48,958
synthesis

379
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,639
uh chloroquine chloride or some people

380
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:53,359
know it as cycle cell

381
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:55,278
cycle cells one of the cormo clots one

382
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,440
of the more widely used chemicals in

383
00:14:55,278 --> 00:14:59,838
agriculture is used

384
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,360
many parts of the world on wheat and

385
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,279
grain crops to

386
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,800
prevent them from lodging to keep them

387
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:08,000
standing up

388
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:09,919
stronger in the fields

389
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,958
they're also being used on turf grasses

390
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:15,120
and golf courses and stuff quite a bit

391
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:16,879
so practical methods all is the one that

392
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,679
is

393
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:21,278
very often used and because it is

394
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:23,838
readily available

395
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:26,559
in agricultural markets i know some

396
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:29,759
cannabis growers have

397
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:33,359
have tried it and have used it so

398
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:37,199
it because it's blocking gibberella

399
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:40,399
it causes the internodes to be

400
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:43,039
more compact shorter

401
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,759
um there is a very very strong

402
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:46,879
relationship

403
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:50,800
with the dose amount that is put on

404
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:52,720
so unless if you take the example of

405
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:54,479
something like a cannabis plant that has

406
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,959
long internodes

407
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,159
so if you would normally be getting

408
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:01,439
internodes that

409
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:03,838
are as the plant is growing either

410
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,920
vegetative or in flowering

411
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:09,199
if the internode naturally would be

412
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:12,559
let's say five inches long

413
00:16:09,198 --> 00:16:15,120
um you could put on a peklobuco's

414
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:18,078
all-amount that might reduce that

415
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,919
to three to four inches or you can put

416
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:22,638
on enough that you reduce it to a half

417
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:25,198
an inch or an inch um

418
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:26,799
and that that's just that is just a

419
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:30,399
matter of what the grower

420
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:32,240
is trying to do and so

421
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:33,440
you can get those kinds of effects

422
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,399
active butters always

423
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,399
very very active

424
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:40,319
the other thing that's important to

425
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,240
think about from the cannabis market

426
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,320
is that hectobutazole is very

427
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,480
long-lasting in the plant

428
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,600
it breaks down into plant degrees very

429
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,680
slowly

430
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,278
and the reason i think that is a

431
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:53,039
significant issue

432
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:54,240
is that more and more markets

433
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:55,599
particularly if you're in a medical

434
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,919
market now

435
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,278
all of your product has to be tested

436
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:02,399
before it goes to

437
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:04,240
to sale and peclet butas all absolutely

438
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,038
will show up in there it does not break

439
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,078
down

440
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:10,318
uh i mean i know i know uh

441
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:11,119
plants that are still showing the growth

442
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:13,359
of practical

443
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:15,438
effects of hexabuchus all five to six

444
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:18,558
years after they've been treated

445
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:21,919
um so i think that is

446
00:17:18,558 --> 00:17:22,639
that is a that is an issue to me that's

447
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:25,600
a

448
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,839
that's a very serious issue for many of

449
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,639
us

450
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:29,519
in the cannabis market yeah oh

451
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,559
absolutely

452
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:33,359
and uh to be clear it's not it's not

453
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:35,599
legal to use

454
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:37,918
paclibutrizol on cannabis there's no

455
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:40,558
legal application for it

456
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,200
i've always you know being an organic

457
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:43,359
grower

458
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,519
had a lot of negative associations with

459
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:46,159
it but i haven't really researched it

460
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:49,279
too much

461
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,720
um one of the things that i think is

462
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:52,399
interesting that you mentioned in terms

463
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,839
of how long it stays in the plant so

464
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,280
it's essentially what you're saying is

465
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:56,798
it's systemic would i have

466
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:58,558
issues cloning a plant that had been

467
00:17:56,798 --> 00:18:02,558
treated with paclobuterosol for

468
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:02,558
say potentially multiple generations

469
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:06,879
depends on the concentration depends on

470
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:10,080
the rate that was put on

471
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,200
okay now on on a mother plant for

472
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:13,279
example

473
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,720
if you put on a little bit too much i

474
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:16,480
mean if we don't just a little impact

475
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,880
abuses all maybe and cut you

476
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,720
the length of your reduce the length of

477
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:24,320
your cuttings by 25

478
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:26,079
or 50 or

479
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:27,439
you can just stack those nodes right on

480
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:31,279
top of each other and you won't have

481
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:33,360
enough stem there to take a cutting on

482
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:35,678
and so if you put on too much on a

483
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:38,240
mother plant you throw the plant away

484
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,679
that's what you end up doing well i

485
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,160
think the main reason people are using

486
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:45,679
it is to increase the weight and density

487
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:48,798
of their buds um or flour

488
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:50,720
and so that that's typically what i hear

489
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:52,240
about again this is not an area that i'm

490
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,440
terribly knowledgeable on i've never

491
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,880
used it

492
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,120
one of the things that you mentioned

493
00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:00,320
because i i was worried about safety

494
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:02,319
um from a you know medical perspective

495
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:04,558
for people who may be immune compromised

496
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:06,798
you know is it carcinogenic

497
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:08,558
those sorts of questions around its use

498
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:10,960
in terms of danger

499
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:11,759
your concern from talking to you sounded

500
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,759
like a more

501
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:15,359
the the highest level risk is with the

502
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:18,558
applicator

503
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:21,599
and i think that's interesting

504
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:22,839
the um with with these in general i

505
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:24,959
think

506
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:27,519
pgrs uh

507
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,519
yes yeah and pesticides in general this

508
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:30,879
is a little bit of a side note but if

509
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:33,038
you

510
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,200
many of our pesticide regulations that

511
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:38,480
we see

512
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:41,679
our design and we talk about

513
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:43,279
the end user the consumer whereas

514
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:45,200
if you're working with something that's

515
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:49,119
toxic the person that has the highest

516
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,120
exposure is the person who's implying

517
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:54,959
um and so if it's something that's toxic

518
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,000
that is the person that has the greatest

519
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,240
potential

520
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,079
problem with it and there are a number

521
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:03,679
of application a number of

522
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:03,678
examples of that uh

523
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:07,439
actually i started using a couple of

524
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,798
specific name examples and i'm

525
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:12,558
i won't i won't do that um

526
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:13,839
because they're sort of in the courts

527
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:17,119
right now and stuff but

528
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:18,399
uh in the cannabis market this spills

529
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:21,839
over to the silver

530
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:24,720
issue in the cannabis market where

531
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:25,599
silver products are being used and

532
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,798
particularly

533
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:29,759
some of the products that are being

534
00:20:26,798 --> 00:20:32,639
recommended for use twice a day

535
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:34,000
until flowering that person who is

536
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,038
applying that silver

537
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,440
has a potential a lot of exposure to uh

538
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:41,759
you know a metal that's not very safe

539
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,759
for you

540
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,520
so that applies to all of our all of our

541
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,880
chemicals

542
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:50,798
uh and back to pacobutazole

543
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,480
i don't know of any impact with yourself

544
00:20:50,798 --> 00:20:53,440
formulation i don't know of any of these

545
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,640
synthetic

546
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:58,480
jibril and uh inhibitors that have an

547
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:02,320
organic label

548
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:04,319
um almost all of them are

549
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:06,960
labeled for food crops in one

550
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:08,158
application or another paclobutazole is

551
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,038
used on

552
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:12,960
uh a number of the tropical fruits where

553
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:14,558
the trees tend to get real large

554
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,159
they can use the package of butchers all

555
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:18,480
to keep the trees from getting quite so

556
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:20,880
large

557
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,960
rice crops in several of the asian

558
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,440
countries are treated with paclobutazole

559
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,360
to

560
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,880
keep it shorter and more compact and

561
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:28,719
stronger so that it

562
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,000
holds up in the fields until it can be

563
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:34,000
harvested so

564
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:37,038
they are used on on food crops uh

565
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,599
now the the paclobucosol label

566
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:42,158
that most of us see is the one is a

567
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:44,000
product called bonsai and bonsai is used

568
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:46,720
on ornamental crops flowers

569
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,880
it's not used on food crops so that

570
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,880
label does not have food crops on it but

571
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:54,480
there are other

572
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:54,480
peplobuchizole labels that do

573
00:21:55,119 --> 00:22:00,959
so if i if i'm buying organic

574
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,400
produce though that would that would

575
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,120
guarantee that these

576
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:07,200
these products are not being used on

577
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:10,558
that crop

578
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:12,279
correct uh uh well you said use the term

579
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:14,399
guarantee

580
00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:17,119
[Laughter]

581
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,600
to the to the best of our knowledge uh

582
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:19,439
you know

583
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:21,759
assuming that someone's not cheating the

584
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:25,038
system if you're if you're buying

585
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:26,240
certified organic then um these products

586
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:28,240
are not allowed in that

587
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,558
there's no there's no synthetic plant

588
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,319
growth regulators that are allowed for

589
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:35,599
use in organic production

590
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:39,200
correct that that's that's correct okay

591
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:40,719
wanting to avoid you know uh wheat crops

592
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,600
that haven't been treated with

593
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,038
uh chloramic water where you you know

594
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:48,158
you buy an organic product

595
00:22:45,038 --> 00:22:49,599
yeah yes that's true but but these

596
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:52,640
things have been being used

597
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:53,519
on our organic produce for decades it

598
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,080
sounds like

599
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:57,519
um from what you're what you're saying

600
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:59,439
like in the case of pacquiao butchers

601
00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:02,720
all

602
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:05,919
uh yeah yeah okay

603
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,360
um and there's no research that you're

604
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:10,400
aware of regarding

605
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:14,240
say combustion versus uh

606
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:16,559
you know consumption of

607
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:19,120
some of these chemicals which is is

608
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:22,720
something i wanted to highlight as well

609
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:23,918
um is there any research to show what

610
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,079
happens when you burn

611
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:28,240
paclibutrizol in the leaf tissue you

612
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:31,519
know in the case of cannabis versus

613
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:33,200
you know eating it in say a rice crop or

614
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:36,389
something like that

615
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:38,480
uh the short answer is no um

616
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:41,360
[Music]

617
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:43,200
you know in general there wouldn't for a

618
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:45,278
company who's selling the product who

619
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:48,080
has to pay for all this testing

620
00:23:45,278 --> 00:23:50,240
uh there will not be a need for them to

621
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:51,278
do that kind of testing and unless

622
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,558
they're selling it

623
00:23:51,278 --> 00:23:56,798
right now into tobacco for example

624
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:59,759
and this group of chemicals none of

625
00:23:56,798 --> 00:24:04,558
these are used on tobacco

626
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:06,640
um and so no i don't know of any testing

627
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:09,759
to see what would

628
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,880
what the response would be on uh any of

629
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:14,079
these products that

630
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:16,960
are uh you know are burnt

631
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:18,480
okay okay well let's uh let's move on to

632
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:22,000
a couple other

633
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:23,839
uh plant growth regulators um besides

634
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,759
you know gibberellin inhibitors let's

635
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:26,079
talk a little bit about triacontinol

636
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:28,000
because

637
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:29,439
you and i were talking about alfalfa

638
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,200
because we're uh we're talking about

639
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,120
maybe you know organic sources

640
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,480
and you shared some stuff that i wasn't

641
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:38,399
aware of regarding

642
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:41,519
you know tricontinol yeah uh tricontinol

643
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:45,440
is uh gosh

644
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:48,639
i was at michigan state and uh

645
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:50,798
oh it was about 70 76

646
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,240
or something like that working on my phd

647
00:24:50,798 --> 00:24:54,639
and one of the

648
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:57,359
faculty members i was working with made

649
00:24:54,640 --> 00:25:01,038
the discovery of tricotinol

650
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:03,519
and it's it's a really interesting

651
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:04,798
molecule it's an interesting uh plant

652
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:06,720
growth regulator

653
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:08,558
alfalfa is where it's been found in the

654
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:12,319
highest concentrations

655
00:25:08,558 --> 00:25:15,440
um i don't know of any commercial

656
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:19,439
trichotinol products i you can

657
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:22,558
you can go to a a chemical supply

658
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:24,960
company and buy tricotinol but that'll

659
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:27,759
be in a real concentrated form

660
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,079
and trichotinol is a in a concentrated

661
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:30,079
form

662
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:31,599
is very very difficult to handle it

663
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:36,158
breaks down

664
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:39,199
very readily um even if you

665
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:40,960
for example handle a spoon and get a

666
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:44,080
little bit of acid off of your

667
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:45,919
fingers and then use that spoon to to

668
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:47,278
handle the trichotinol it'll break the

669
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:50,799
tricotton all down

670
00:25:47,278 --> 00:25:54,400
and so oblivious activity um

671
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:57,440
but where track continue has shown to

672
00:25:54,400 --> 00:26:00,720
to really have its best effect is

673
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:03,840
using alfalfa as a mulch

674
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:06,000
around plants and uh

675
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:09,519
the original work was actually an

676
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:13,200
accident using tri-cotton oil as a mulch

677
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:14,798
and seeing how much uh promotion and

678
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,840
growth occurred in some of the grain

679
00:26:14,798 --> 00:26:18,960
crops

680
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:22,959
um so i think the

681
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:26,319
the place for that is if the you know if

682
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,679
if a cannabis producer has access to

683
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:30,720
alfalfa

684
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:33,200
uh using that as a uh

685
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,839
either incorporated into the soil or as

686
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,038
a

687
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:38,879
as a mulch for in-ground plants would be

688
00:26:37,038 --> 00:26:39,679
the place that there would be a real use

689
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,640
there

690
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:44,080
and so sometimes it works real well it's

691
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,799
like a lot of the plant hormones are

692
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:46,399
like this

693
00:26:44,798 --> 00:26:48,158
sometimes it works real well and

694
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,759
sometimes it doesn't work very well

695
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:51,360
there's not any negative effects but

696
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:53,038
when it works

697
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:54,639
the effects on plant growth very

698
00:26:53,038 --> 00:26:57,839
dramatic yields

699
00:26:54,640 --> 00:27:01,038
the things that are increased so if i

700
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:03,839
were to as an organic grower throw some

701
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:05,599
alfalfa meal in my soil i'm probably not

702
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:07,199
getting a lot of tricontinol

703
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:09,519
benefits because it's probably breaking

704
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,519
down

705
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:14,879
what i'm getting or you know does the

706
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,840
pelletization process or even the meal

707
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:19,760
process with

708
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:21,599
with alfalfa affect tricontinol

709
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:23,359
do we need are you when you talk about

710
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:26,398
mulching are we talking about

711
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:28,959
you know uh something more stemmy

712
00:27:26,398 --> 00:27:29,439
more like the original plant crop itself

713
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,840
yeah

714
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,679
now this this goes beyond my real

715
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:35,359
experience because i have not worked on

716
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:38,440
tricottnell since

717
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:39,759
you know looking at michigan state um

718
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:42,798
[Music]

719
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:45,919
and so what i'm familiar with is getting

720
00:27:42,798 --> 00:27:49,278
the the performance from using

721
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:52,720
uh the alfalfa plants as mulch

722
00:27:49,278 --> 00:27:55,440
okay and so what happens when it's uh

723
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:57,440
pollicized and and dried and that kind

724
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,519
of thing i don't know

725
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,038
okay so that we could do our own i'm

726
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:02,000
sure i'm sure there's some folks that

727
00:28:01,038 --> 00:28:03,278
are looking i'm sure

728
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,278
there are some folks that are looking at

729
00:28:03,278 --> 00:28:07,599
tricotinol now that have

730
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:09,038
have much more update information than i

731
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:10,639
do

732
00:28:09,038 --> 00:28:11,440
yeah that's great well can we go back

733
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,038
you know i don't one thing we didn't

734
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,399
really even talk about what what is what

735
00:28:13,038 --> 00:28:17,038
tri continental

736
00:28:14,398 --> 00:28:18,239
does like what are the the benefits are

737
00:28:17,038 --> 00:28:21,919
in terms of a

738
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:24,000
plant growth uh if gramos photosynthesis

739
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:27,200
photosynthesis it promotes growth makes

740
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,200
the plants more efficient

741
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:33,359
so when you say promotes photosynthesis

742
00:28:30,798 --> 00:28:36,240
would it allow the plant to take in

743
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:37,278
more light as in it could handle higher

744
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,278
light intensity

745
00:28:37,278 --> 00:28:40,960
or that it allows it to be more

746
00:28:39,278 --> 00:28:43,038
efficient with the amount of light it's

747
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:47,200
receiving

748
00:28:43,038 --> 00:28:50,558
uh both okay both

749
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:53,038
yeah um and co2 that's that's the other

750
00:28:50,558 --> 00:28:54,558
one is more efficient with uh

751
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:56,879
of course if you're an outside grower

752
00:28:54,558 --> 00:28:59,519
you're locked into natural co2 levels

753
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,000
and the plant is more efficient you know

754
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:02,079
yeah

755
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,519
now that's interesting i might be worth

756
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:05,599
trying some trials

757
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:06,960
you know some controlled environment

758
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:09,519
trials

759
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,319
using alfalfa as a mulch i'd be curious

760
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:11,918
to

761
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:13,918
do a little research or learn more about

762
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:17,360
that i wonder if there's any

763
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:18,960
uh negatives in terms of pest habitat

764
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:20,639
and and other things like that that

765
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,720
might offset but

766
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:25,440
um i'll have to talk to suzanne and kind

767
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:28,880
of pick her brain on that one

768
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:31,840
right right yeah interesting though

769
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,039
can we you know you touched on ethylene

770
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:34,000
that's one that there were a lot of

771
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:35,278
questions about

772
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,720
you know when i think of ethylene i

773
00:29:35,278 --> 00:29:40,558
think of bananas and ripening

774
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,720
but i don't know a lot about it how

775
00:29:40,558 --> 00:29:44,720
would one potentially use

776
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,240
ethylene gas to their benefit when we

777
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,240
talk about cannabis or

778
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,679
or detriment are there things to avoid

779
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:54,159
in terms of ripening

780
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:56,159
or how this gas works yeah well ethylene

781
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:58,960
um i've never treated a cannabis plant

782
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,960
with ethylene

783
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:04,000
and there is a

784
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:10,000
a product called ethaphon

785
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:11,599
can be used and is used on a number of

786
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,839
crops to

787
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:15,439
spray the ethaphon and then inside the

788
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:17,439
plant is converted to ethylene so it

789
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:20,640
would not be difficult to apply

790
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,360
basically apply ethylene to a cannabis

791
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,200
plant

792
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:26,240
the responses that i would anticipate

793
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:29,519
getting would be enhanced leaf yellowing

794
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:31,120
uh senescence to leaves um

795
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:32,798
if you put it a little bit too early you

796
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:36,398
can knock off flowers

797
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:38,558
um and so

798
00:30:36,398 --> 00:30:39,759
timing on ethylene and its application

799
00:30:38,558 --> 00:30:42,879
in plants is a

800
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:45,359
is a real issue now one of the things

801
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:49,360
that ethylene would do

802
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:52,639
um is

803
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:55,918
ethylene would tend to make a plant

804
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:58,080
more likely be female so

805
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:59,759
where you're typically where you i think

806
00:30:58,079 --> 00:31:01,278
this is a little bit of a stretch but

807
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:03,839
we're having a problem with

808
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:06,240
herbaphonites

809
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:07,599
ethylene potentially would prevent that

810
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:11,200
problem

811
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:12,558
okay um but i i anticipate that you'll

812
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:15,600
see too many negative

813
00:31:12,558 --> 00:31:19,200
effects with ethylene itself the

814
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:22,639
place for ethylene in cannabis

815
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:26,080
is the products that

816
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:27,519
are preventing uh the plant from

817
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:30,240
producing ethylene

818
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:30,798
ethylene is involved in sex expression

819
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,960
so

820
00:31:30,798 --> 00:31:34,480
in cannabis a number of other plants if

821
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,240
you block

822
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,759
the ethylene natural production of

823
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,399
ethylene in the plant

824
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:42,640
it will shift from producing female

825
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:46,079
flowers to male flowers

826
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:48,720
and so that's where um

827
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:50,240
there are a number of cannabis folks and

828
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:53,519
particularly the

829
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:56,399
feminized hemp seed that's

830
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:57,759
you know become so popular in the market

831
00:31:56,398 --> 00:32:01,518
that tends to be

832
00:31:57,759 --> 00:32:05,599
produced using a product that blocks the

833
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:08,880
natural ethylene production in the plant

834
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:10,158
okay so um you know

835
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,919
i guess we need to get into how you

836
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:13,440
produce feminized seed but you need to

837
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:17,038
take a female plant

838
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:20,480
and get male

839
00:32:17,038 --> 00:32:23,278
flowers and dust pollen produced

840
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:25,278
on that on that plant and you do that by

841
00:32:23,278 --> 00:32:26,720
blocking the ethylene production in the

842
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:30,798
plant

843
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:34,240
okay okay so when i think of

844
00:32:30,798 --> 00:32:37,359
ethylene i think of um

845
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:40,558
you know post-production like i assume

846
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:42,158
that you know after we harvest the bud

847
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:44,158
and it's in a jar

848
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:45,919
ethylene is probably building up in that

849
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:48,559
jar so when we burp the jar we're

850
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:50,320
going to lower the ethylene levels in a

851
00:32:48,558 --> 00:32:52,240
jar and then when we put the lid back on

852
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:53,599
that process would restart and that's

853
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,159
something we're kind of

854
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:56,959
naturally regulating in in the curing

855
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:00,640
process

856
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:03,679
is that is that way off base

857
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:05,679
um well i i i just made it at that point

858
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:07,200
that once you dry that

859
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:10,240
material you're not going to get any

860
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:12,640
more eflain really produced by it

861
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,480
so as it's drying though is what i'm

862
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,399
wondering i mean maybe not once it's

863
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,519
cured but as it's going through that

864
00:33:16,398 --> 00:33:19,518
sort of

865
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:21,440
curing process like moving towards

866
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:23,599
homeostasis in terms of the

867
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,960
the leaf tissue is is there still

868
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:27,119
ethylene being produced or

869
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:29,038
is at that point is it done it the

870
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:29,439
ethylene the ethylene production is

871
00:33:29,038 --> 00:33:31,440
gonna

872
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,600
going to be decreasing just like all of

873
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:35,600
the other um

874
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:37,519
when when that tissue is first cut

875
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:38,000
there's a big blast of ethylene is

876
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:40,480
produced

877
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
that's a natural thing that the plant

878
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,079
does

879
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,278
uh when it's wounded it produces a lot

880
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:47,599
of ethylene

881
00:33:45,278 --> 00:33:49,440
but then as as it's drying out the

882
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:51,599
amount of ethylene

883
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:54,000
that is produced will be dramatically

884
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:55,759
reused

885
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,359
so that that kind of takes me in a

886
00:33:55,759 --> 00:33:58,240
different direction like when we go in

887
00:33:57,359 --> 00:34:01,199
and say

888
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,798
prune our flowering room uh and remove a

889
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,120
bunch of material and we're making a lot

890
00:34:02,798 --> 00:34:05,519
of

891
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:06,239
plant wounds would that be a good time

892
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:11,119
then to

893
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:13,519
potentially um do an air exchange

894
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:14,960
to remove any or is that probably

895
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:16,079
insignificant in terms of the amount of

896
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,199
ethylene that's actually being

897
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:19,200
production

898
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:20,960
yeah that staff would yeah i think

899
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:23,918
deathling is very important

900
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,878
but most of that is sort of internal

901
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:27,759
ethylene it's in

902
00:34:24,878 --> 00:34:28,960
in the tissues and moving around okay

903
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:32,839
and

904
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:36,240
and i think i actually i anticipate

905
00:34:32,838 --> 00:34:38,078
that um

906
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:40,239
in particular as we get close up the

907
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:43,359
closer to flowering and harvest

908
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:46,479
that a lot of what we're doing

909
00:34:43,358 --> 00:34:48,480
is stimulating stress in that plant so

910
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,838
that it will produce more oils more

911
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:53,039
terpenes

912
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:53,599
and ethylene is involved in that so so i

913
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:56,960
think our

914
00:34:53,599 --> 00:35:00,000
wounding of the plant at that point

915
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,480
is making the plant respond like it's

916
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,519
being

917
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:07,119
attacked by insects and so

918
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:10,800
ethylene is a natural factor there the

919
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:13,838
the gestaltic acid is an act

920
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:15,440
natural part of that process and so

921
00:35:13,838 --> 00:35:17,119
we're actually benefiting from that

922
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,599
ethylene production when we wound the

923
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:21,519
plants at that stage

924
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:23,440
okay yeah i mean plant stress i think is

925
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:24,719
is a fascinating topic when we talk

926
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,720
about cannabis

927
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:27,838
so essentially it's pretty complex yeah

928
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:29,838
yeah yeah

929
00:35:27,838 --> 00:35:31,920
now i've always been under the

930
00:35:29,838 --> 00:35:33,199
impression with cannabis that

931
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,599
you know with all the facilities that

932
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:36,799
i've visited that we have no issues

933
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:39,119
creating plant stress

934
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,640
so i'm always on the side of reducing

935
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:42,320
plant stress because it seems like every

936
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:44,159
facility has something

937
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,599
you know there's no perfect grow out

938
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:48,719
there at least as far as

939
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:50,640
i've seen um but i do wonder about

940
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:52,399
targeted plant stress like i've heard of

941
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:54,239
tomato farmers flooding their fields

942
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,240
with salinity i've heard of other

943
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:57,279
with other food crops you know targeted

944
00:35:56,239 --> 00:36:00,719
plant stress

945
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:03,839
to increase fruit production or

946
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:05,759
you know flavonoids terpene expression

947
00:36:03,838 --> 00:36:06,960
um have you seen any research in that in

948
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,680
regards to

949
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:11,440
cannabis or any direction in relation to

950
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:13,358
our conversation that you think might be

951
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:16,159
well

952
00:36:13,358 --> 00:36:16,639
the research that has been done clearly

953
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:19,759
shows

954
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:22,239
that the stress uh that's

955
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,920
you know tend to apply to cannabis and

956
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:27,118
the way it's grown

957
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:31,280
is stimulating terpenes

958
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:31,760
um which but i think that's as far as we

959
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,560
really

960
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,760
go in our information about how to

961
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:37,519
control it

962
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:40,000
we're doing it but we're not controlling

963
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:43,440
it very well um

964
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:46,400
so um our high salt stress

965
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:48,800
uh if we're drought stressing definitely

966
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:50,880
the leaf removal

967
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,240
um even the air that we're blowing over

968
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:55,680
the plants is

969
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:58,239
causes ethylene formation

970
00:36:55,679 --> 00:36:59,199
and so we're doing a lot to stress the

971
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:01,199
plants

972
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:03,598
but we're not doing very much in a

973
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:05,598
controlled setting so i think

974
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:07,039
as the industry and the information

975
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:09,680
evolves

976
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:11,440
we're going to be finding out which are

977
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:15,039
the best stressors

978
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:16,639
and when to apply them uh

979
00:37:15,039 --> 00:37:18,880
and right now i haven't seen any

980
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:20,319
research that really tells us that

981
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,160
i think i think there are a lot of

982
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,200
individuals that they feel like what

983
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:26,319
those works

984
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:27,598
works best in their facility but we we

985
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:30,480
don't understand

986
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:31,280
you know the why behind it yeah i mean

987
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,920
i've even seen

988
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,640
guys throw ice cubes all over their soil

989
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,960
to

990
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:37,679
you know prior to harvest to freeze the

991
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,720
plants

992
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:43,118
um you know and shock it that way uh

993
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:44,879
you name it i've seen it i feel like on

994
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:47,599
in forums and stuff

995
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:49,599
but uh you're right we don't know and

996
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,240
it's it's very uncontrolled and i think

997
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:51,519
it's

998
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:53,358
i think it's interesting and the other

999
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:54,960
thing to bring up is we we have a

1000
00:37:53,358 --> 00:37:56,559
massive genetic diversity

1001
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,838
in cannabis when we talk about the

1002
00:37:56,559 --> 00:37:59,279
selection of cultivars that we're

1003
00:37:57,838 --> 00:38:01,920
dealing with where you don't have that

1004
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,599
in other food crops for the most part

1005
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,880
and that's going to affect things too i

1006
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:07,359
would think and we have to account for

1007
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:10,400
that as well

1008
00:38:07,358 --> 00:38:11,838
with all the plant hormones the the

1009
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:15,760
plant diversity is a big

1010
00:38:11,838 --> 00:38:19,279
issue uh what works best or the dose

1011
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:21,599
or the timing of the dose and one strain

1012
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:24,240
if i'm working with tomatoes or

1013
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:28,640
geraniums or poinsettias or whatever

1014
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:29,679
this the uh what well cannabis folks

1015
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:32,319
call them strains and

1016
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:33,440
agriculture we call them varieties or

1017
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:36,000
cultivars

1018
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:38,000
but from one to another the dose and the

1019
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,838
timing is different the optimum dose in

1020
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:44,320
timing is different

1021
00:38:39,838 --> 00:38:47,358
and cannabis is one of the most diverse

1022
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,760
plants and from a crop standpoint that

1023
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:50,400
uh

1024
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:51,440
that you can find and so there's a huge

1025
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,400
variation

1026
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:56,400
that we don't understand yet yeah i

1027
00:38:54,400 --> 00:39:00,000
think that's an important thing to

1028
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:01,119
remind people of because what may be

1029
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,838
perfect for one

1030
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:05,200
you know strainer cultivar may have an

1031
00:39:03,838 --> 00:39:05,838
entirely different effect because when i

1032
00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:07,279
think of

1033
00:39:05,838 --> 00:39:08,799
uh you know when you talk specifically

1034
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,800
about gibberellin i can think of some

1035
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,720
plants that are already quite compact

1036
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:15,680
relative to others that are you know

1037
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:16,399
huge internodal spacing um and there's

1038
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:18,239
there are big

1039
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,760
and you know research on other crops

1040
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:21,598
that tell me that there's big

1041
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,800
differences in the level of ga that's

1042
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:24,800
produced by those

1043
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,079
different strains yeah that's really

1044
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:29,440
interesting

1045
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:30,880
yeah yeah well let's uh let's move on to

1046
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,519
another one here we talked about

1047
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,640
ethylene

1048
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:35,199
uh jasmonic acid or jasminate is another

1049
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:38,400
one that

1050
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:41,279
um i've seen in relation to roses

1051
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,800
yeah but before we get off of that and

1052
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:46,240
i'm not following time

1053
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:48,000
uh but under the ethylene we did not

1054
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:49,039
really directly talk about silver

1055
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,239
phthalo sulfate

1056
00:39:49,039 --> 00:39:55,679
oh sure yeah yeah so

1057
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:59,118
for blocking ethylene um

1058
00:39:55,679 --> 00:40:03,039
silver thousand sulfate is a chemical

1059
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:05,838
that a lot of folks that are producing

1060
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:06,480
cannabis seed are using to produce that

1061
00:40:05,838 --> 00:40:09,519
male

1062
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:12,719
plant from a female

1063
00:40:09,519 --> 00:40:16,880
clone um

1064
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:18,318
silver also is um

1065
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,000
it's a chemical that's been around for a

1066
00:40:18,318 --> 00:40:21,838
long time and this effect on that thing

1067
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,639
is really pretty well known

1068
00:40:21,838 --> 00:40:25,440
um there are there you can buy it on

1069
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:28,799
amazon

1070
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:31,039
uh with a you know a product with the

1071
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,000
marijuana leaf on it and that kind of

1072
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:35,599
thing but

1073
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:38,960
there's no labeling is that i mean it's

1074
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:39,760
technically it is a pesticide and

1075
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:42,079
there's no

1076
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,040
there's no federal or state labeling

1077
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:46,240
that i know of

1078
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:47,759
or silver thousand sulfate um

1079
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:49,279
there's information on how to make it

1080
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:51,200
yourself uh

1081
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,200
that kind of thing but it is not a

1082
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:54,078
really safe product that silver is in

1083
00:40:53,199 --> 00:40:57,838
there

1084
00:40:54,079 --> 00:41:00,880
and um from an environmental standpoint

1085
00:40:57,838 --> 00:41:01,519
uh if you're using silver salt valve

1086
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,000
sulfate

1087
00:41:01,519 --> 00:41:05,599
spraying it in a greenhouse or a growth

1088
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,679
room or something you're getting it into

1089
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:11,440
the environment

1090
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:14,879
so in my mind it's not a very safe

1091
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,838
alternative um there's another product

1092
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,000
that this is this

1093
00:41:15,838 --> 00:41:20,159
uh this other product is called ethel

1094
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:23,340
block or mcp is the

1095
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:24,559
molecule mcp

1096
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:26,960
[Music]

1097
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:28,400
it is a labeled product for use on

1098
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:31,679
agricultural crops it's

1099
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:35,760
not labeled on cannabis

1100
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:38,559
but it is a safer product

1101
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,880
there is another product that breaks

1102
00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:42,400
that

1103
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:44,960
stops ethylene and

1104
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,838
it's called evg and there is a

1105
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,599
commercial

1106
00:41:45,838 --> 00:41:48,960
product that's used on apples called

1107
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:52,640
retain

1108
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:55,039
uh that

1109
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:56,719
you know if you're gonna if you're gonna

1110
00:41:55,039 --> 00:41:59,599
do something that's

1111
00:41:56,719 --> 00:42:00,000
well you know if you're doing something

1112
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:01,920
that

1113
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,679
none of it's gonna be labeled i think

1114
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,039
you'd be better off using a safer

1115
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:08,559
product than a silver

1116
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:09,920
product um and you know i know

1117
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:12,318
that there are some people that are

1118
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:14,720
talking about using the colloidal

1119
00:42:12,318 --> 00:42:14,719
silver

1120
00:42:15,358 --> 00:42:20,480
for the same effect and to me that's the

1121
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:22,960
least efficient it requires much more

1122
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:26,079
silver to do it and it's more dangerous

1123
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:29,119
um so anyway that's my

1124
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:30,079
that's my two cents right there yeah

1125
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:30,960
that's not an area i'm very

1126
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:32,880
knowledgeable about

1127
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,240
you know as an organic person i think oh

1128
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:36,240
silver it's a metal

1129
00:42:34,239 --> 00:42:38,239
uh that sounds like a good option but

1130
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:38,719
you know organic doesn't necessarily

1131
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:42,318
equate

1132
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:43,598
safe there's a lot of organic compounds

1133
00:42:42,318 --> 00:42:45,279
that are quite dangerous

1134
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:47,200
and i think that's an important

1135
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:48,480
distinction that you mentioned there so

1136
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:52,239
thank you for sharing that

1137
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:55,280
yeah yeah um actually and jim roland

1138
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:57,358
gibral and uh jibrillan products are

1139
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:59,040
widely used in the markets and in

1140
00:42:57,358 --> 00:43:01,519
agricultural markets

1141
00:42:59,039 --> 00:43:03,679
and they will tend to do the same thing

1142
00:43:01,519 --> 00:43:06,000
they're not quite as efficient as the

1143
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:07,598
silver thyla sulfate but they will

1144
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:12,000
they'll do the same thing and promote

1145
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:16,079
male flowers okay

1146
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:17,159
so i want to come back to uh

1147
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:19,440
you know we talked a little about

1148
00:43:17,159 --> 00:43:20,399
paclobutrazole when we talking about

1149
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,480
safety

1150
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:24,160
you know i did do a little quick

1151
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,639
googling and saw there was some research

1152
00:43:24,159 --> 00:43:26,639
showing

1153
00:43:24,639 --> 00:43:28,639
potential liver damage in rats related

1154
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:31,598
to paclibutrizol

1155
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:32,239
obviously growers that were using it and

1156
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:35,119
it was in

1157
00:43:32,239 --> 00:43:35,519
a lot of these hydroponic products uh

1158
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:37,280
you know

1159
00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:39,199
found one thing to realize is that

1160
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:41,040
people are putting stuff off label in

1161
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:43,199
these hydroponic

1162
00:43:41,039 --> 00:43:45,279
nutrient products or they have in the

1163
00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:45,759
past and that's the big challenge you

1164
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:48,800
know so

1165
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:50,079
and these are pretty major companies you

1166
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,680
know everyone knows the names of these

1167
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:53,200
companies and they were able to make a

1168
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:53,598
lot of money by selling these because if

1169
00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:56,239
you can

1170
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:58,240
it makes growing plants or growing

1171
00:43:56,239 --> 00:44:00,000
cannabis a heck of a lot easier if you

1172
00:43:58,239 --> 00:44:01,838
can cut down your flowering times

1173
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,599
that saves you a lot of money you know

1174
00:44:01,838 --> 00:44:05,920
in other products i know this

1175
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:07,200
isn't maybe a pgr but i wanted to talk a

1176
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:10,240
little bit about

1177
00:44:07,199 --> 00:44:12,159
eagle 20 when we're talking about some

1178
00:44:10,239 --> 00:44:14,078
of these potential

1179
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:15,358
you know products that people are using

1180
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:19,039
in cannabis that

1181
00:44:15,358 --> 00:44:20,880
are not necessarily legal

1182
00:44:19,039 --> 00:44:22,400
did you want to touch it all on do you

1183
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,039
have any familiarity with that product

1184
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,680
at all

1185
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:26,079
in terms of uh you know i'm familiar

1186
00:44:25,679 --> 00:44:28,239
enough

1187
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:30,560
with it that i i know what the situation

1188
00:44:28,239 --> 00:44:34,479
is and

1189
00:44:30,559 --> 00:44:39,199
this this is a problem in the marijuana

1190
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:42,880
uh cannabis market um

1191
00:44:39,199 --> 00:44:46,399
and and and it gets

1192
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:48,240
and it gets you know back to not knowing

1193
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,440
what's in some of these things that are

1194
00:44:48,239 --> 00:44:52,639
purchased and used

1195
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:54,079
and it's easy to do the marketing it's

1196
00:44:52,639 --> 00:44:56,719
easy to create

1197
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:57,440
really glossy brochures and bright

1198
00:44:56,719 --> 00:45:00,000
labels

1199
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:01,599
and all that kind of stuff and and the

1200
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,159
marketing

1201
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:05,920
uh the marketing can make the the

1202
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:07,358
product sound like that it's

1203
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:09,280
you know the best things that sliced

1204
00:45:07,358 --> 00:45:10,719
bread um

1205
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:12,319
and you don't know everything that's in

1206
00:45:10,719 --> 00:45:15,679
there and you don't know what

1207
00:45:12,318 --> 00:45:18,318
is you know what's what's there and so

1208
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:20,480
that's where i come from traditional

1209
00:45:18,318 --> 00:45:24,159
agriculture i like labels i like

1210
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:25,280
information that is legal describes what

1211
00:45:24,159 --> 00:45:28,559
the product is

1212
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:30,319
what it'll do you know how to use it

1213
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:32,719
and identifies everything that's in

1214
00:45:30,318 --> 00:45:36,079
there um

1215
00:45:32,719 --> 00:45:37,838
and so the sooner we can get to that and

1216
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:40,079
you know 100 percent in the marijuana

1217
00:45:37,838 --> 00:45:42,960
market uh the better

1218
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:45,119
uh there's still just lots of material

1219
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,599
that you can buy from amazon or down at

1220
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:47,519
uh

1221
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:48,880
you know the big box store or where

1222
00:45:47,519 --> 00:45:53,199
wherever

1223
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:55,119
um online sources that uh

1224
00:45:53,199 --> 00:45:58,159
i described it sometimes the marketing

1225
00:45:55,119 --> 00:46:00,559
is better than the product itself

1226
00:45:58,159 --> 00:46:02,719
and that that's unfortunate so i would

1227
00:46:00,559 --> 00:46:05,679
really encourage

1228
00:46:02,719 --> 00:46:06,799
you know everyone that's uh that's

1229
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:09,039
growing cannabis

1230
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:10,000
to really pay attention to the products

1231
00:46:09,039 --> 00:46:11,759
that they're using

1232
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,199
and making making sure that they're

1233
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:15,440
getting better that's

1234
00:46:13,199 --> 00:46:16,639
that's the important thing to me is that

1235
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:20,079
we're always moving

1236
00:46:16,639 --> 00:46:20,078
in a better direction

1237
00:46:20,559 --> 00:46:26,078
yeah i guess i want to touch on that

1238
00:46:24,159 --> 00:46:29,279
really quickly jim because

1239
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:30,560
you know as as a grower to be able to

1240
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:33,440
use

1241
00:46:30,559 --> 00:46:34,078
pgrs and you know micro butanol which

1242
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:36,079
we're talking about

1243
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:37,920
when you say something like eagle 20 it

1244
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:38,960
makes it really easy to grow the plants

1245
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,920
finishing sooner

1246
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:44,400
it's denser you know applying a systemic

1247
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:45,440
pesticide allows us to not have to worry

1248
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:48,400
about

1249
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:48,880
things like mites or things like powdery

1250
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,960
mildew

1251
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:53,280
it makes it really easy for the grower

1252
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,880
to grow a healthy looking plant

1253
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,319
but when we talk about the risk

1254
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,680
associated with it

1255
00:46:56,318 --> 00:46:59,838
you know i want to highlight that one

1256
00:46:57,679 --> 00:47:01,440
it's risky to the to the grower

1257
00:46:59,838 --> 00:47:03,039
because they're exposing themselves to

1258
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:04,318
higher levels of these toxins they're

1259
00:47:03,039 --> 00:47:06,079
probably not doing it

1260
00:47:04,318 --> 00:47:07,920
in a manner that's safe this is all off

1261
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:09,280
label and not researched

1262
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:11,119
and they haven't been trained they don't

1263
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,920
have a pesticide license to apply these

1264
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:14,000
things

1265
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:15,519
uh so there's a risk to them but then

1266
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,800
the risk to the consumer like with

1267
00:47:15,519 --> 00:47:21,280
michael butanol you know i've read that

1268
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,000
you know it is used on a lot of our our

1269
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,839
food crops

1270
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,000
and that's something that that i think

1271
00:47:23,838 --> 00:47:27,838
growers use in defense of its use in

1272
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,679
cannabis however

1273
00:47:27,838 --> 00:47:31,759
there is no research it's not allowed on

1274
00:47:29,679 --> 00:47:34,078
tobacco there is no research in terms of

1275
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:36,319
exposure versus inhalation

1276
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:37,359
or via inhalation or absorption through

1277
00:47:36,318 --> 00:47:40,639
the skin

1278
00:47:37,358 --> 00:47:40,639
as well as um

1279
00:47:40,719 --> 00:47:43,838
you know when we when we burn it

1280
00:47:43,039 --> 00:47:45,440
supposedly

1281
00:47:43,838 --> 00:47:47,119
what i've read from you know people

1282
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:50,880
smarter than me is that it releases

1283
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:51,680
a highly toxic gas or form of cyanide

1284
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:55,039
and

1285
00:47:51,679 --> 00:47:58,078
so i i worry that people

1286
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:59,838
growers look at these pgrs or you know

1287
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:01,599
some of these pesticides are systemic

1288
00:47:59,838 --> 00:48:04,000
and say oh well they're used on

1289
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:04,800
apples or they're used on mangoes or

1290
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,880
rice

1291
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:08,160
they're they're safe and that's why when

1292
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:10,000
you say you know this

1293
00:48:08,159 --> 00:48:11,039
this thing about labels i think that's

1294
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,559
so important i don't think we can

1295
00:48:11,039 --> 00:48:15,679
highlight that enough

1296
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:17,359
um because these labels are

1297
00:48:15,679 --> 00:48:18,799
there's hundreds of thousands of dollars

1298
00:48:17,358 --> 00:48:19,358
if not millions of dollars behind the

1299
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:21,039
creation

1300
00:48:19,358 --> 00:48:23,358
and testing of what they're allowed to

1301
00:48:21,039 --> 00:48:25,920
put on this label

1302
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:27,920
yeah and that's i mean sometimes the

1303
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:31,519
government regulations are good for us

1304
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:34,639
uh for a

1305
00:48:31,519 --> 00:48:38,400
any pesticide product

1306
00:48:34,639 --> 00:48:40,719
to get a label for cannabis

1307
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,599
a federal label for cannabis it has to

1308
00:48:40,719 --> 00:48:44,959
be tested

1309
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:46,880
residues have to be established

1310
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:49,119
all of that kind of thing and so it

1311
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,440
would be a much much safer situation for

1312
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:51,440
us

1313
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:52,960
um even if you just talked about organic

1314
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:55,599
see that's one of the current

1315
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:57,519
problems with the organic certification

1316
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:58,960
it's a federal certification and you

1317
00:48:57,519 --> 00:49:01,440
can't get that

1318
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:02,720
you can call it organic or natural or

1319
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:06,159
something but it's not

1320
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:08,000
tested to be that uh so and if you

1321
00:49:06,159 --> 00:49:09,440
really get an organic

1322
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,358
i mean if you go to the grocery store

1323
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:13,599
and you buy an organic tomato it has a

1324
00:49:11,358 --> 00:49:16,000
little label on there that's

1325
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:18,160
you know it says it's been certified as

1326
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,838
being organic well an independent agency

1327
00:49:18,159 --> 00:49:22,000
has to come in

1328
00:49:19,838 --> 00:49:22,880
and evaluate what that farmer producer

1329
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,480
is doing

1330
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:27,119
to make sure that they're following all

1331
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:29,838
the rules and so if you're just

1332
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:32,240
selling any kind of product and saying

1333
00:49:29,838 --> 00:49:34,078
that it's natural and it's safe for it

1334
00:49:32,239 --> 00:49:35,759
just using the term organic without

1335
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:37,039
using the official label

1336
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:39,920
there's no one that's actually

1337
00:49:37,039 --> 00:49:42,239
inspecting that as certifying it

1338
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:44,240
so that's that's where i think as we

1339
00:49:42,239 --> 00:49:47,358
move in that direction of more

1340
00:49:44,239 --> 00:49:50,399
federal regulation and just

1341
00:49:47,358 --> 00:49:52,239
in this space would be a lot better off

1342
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:53,519
absolutely you really it really comes

1343
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:56,159
down to knowing your grower

1344
00:49:53,519 --> 00:49:56,639
and there are certifications out there

1345
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:57,440
like

1346
00:49:56,639 --> 00:49:59,679
i don't know if you've heard of

1347
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:00,720
certified kind with andrew black where

1348
00:49:59,679 --> 00:50:04,639
he is

1349
00:50:00,719 --> 00:50:07,759
following these same standards uh

1350
00:50:04,639 --> 00:50:09,358
that the nop uses and and actually doing

1351
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:11,119
right and doing testing so

1352
00:50:09,358 --> 00:50:13,598
that's great the problem is there's just

1353
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:16,000
not enough

1354
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:16,800
oh i guess not enough public awareness

1355
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,358
around it

1356
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:21,359
you know to where that certification has

1357
00:50:19,358 --> 00:50:23,440
as much value as i think it should

1358
00:50:21,358 --> 00:50:24,880
you know that that certified organic

1359
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:26,400
sticker

1360
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:27,838
when we go into the grocery store it

1361
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:29,119
carries a lot of weight at least for

1362
00:50:27,838 --> 00:50:30,239
someone like me i'm putting a lot of

1363
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:32,960
trust behind it

1364
00:50:30,239 --> 00:50:35,358
compared to you know i'm paying what 50

1365
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:37,599
cents a dollar or more

1366
00:50:35,358 --> 00:50:38,480
uh produce for it you know and i

1367
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:40,160
realized that

1368
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:41,760
i'm paying for that certification i'm

1369
00:50:40,159 --> 00:50:43,358
paying for that company to do that work

1370
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:45,119
and know that my product is

1371
00:50:43,358 --> 00:50:46,558
what i'm eating is grown in a way that

1372
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:49,599
fits with my

1373
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:51,200
you know my ethics or my morality so

1374
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:54,000
yeah you're absolutely right that is a

1375
00:50:51,199 --> 00:50:57,759
challenging cannabis right now

1376
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,960
yeah so uh so dad one of the things that

1377
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:00,800
we might want to discuss

1378
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:03,039
just a little bit i think you mentioned

1379
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:05,920
that you had some questions about the

1380
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:07,599
uh temperature and affecting growth and

1381
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:09,680
what we refer to as the difference in

1382
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:11,440
day and night temperature

1383
00:51:09,679 --> 00:51:12,879
yes we'll take a moment to do that

1384
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:14,639
absolutely so the three things i want to

1385
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:16,160
cover with you before signing off i know

1386
00:51:14,639 --> 00:51:19,519
we're running a little long here

1387
00:51:16,159 --> 00:51:20,480
um was was that topic that how adjusting

1388
00:51:19,519 --> 00:51:22,480
temperatures may

1389
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:24,159
work similar to you know some of these

1390
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:26,079
pgrs and how that might be useful for

1391
00:51:24,159 --> 00:51:26,719
people i want to talk about jasmonic

1392
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:28,318
acid

1393
00:51:26,719 --> 00:51:30,959
and then i want to talk about stability

1394
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:34,159
because people are making a lot of

1395
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:36,480
uh you know ferments or applying

1396
00:51:34,159 --> 00:51:37,920
organic products like kelp meal for

1397
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:39,519
example and thinking that they're

1398
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:42,559
getting

1399
00:51:39,519 --> 00:51:43,838
these various pgrs or alfalfa and how i

1400
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:45,040
want to talk about how stable these

1401
00:51:43,838 --> 00:51:45,599
things actually are to know if they're

1402
00:51:45,039 --> 00:51:47,759
if they're

1403
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:49,920
potentially even in the final product to

1404
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:52,240
say yeah we are getting some of these

1405
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:54,318
natural pgrs or no they're probably

1406
00:51:52,239 --> 00:51:55,919
you know disappearing before they ever

1407
00:51:54,318 --> 00:51:57,679
really have an effect on the plant

1408
00:51:55,920 --> 00:52:00,559
so those are the three things yeah where

1409
00:51:57,679 --> 00:52:00,558
would you like to start okay

1410
00:52:01,199 --> 00:52:04,639
all right all right first dip um okay

1411
00:52:04,318 --> 00:52:07,199
and

1412
00:52:04,639 --> 00:52:08,239
this is basically uh short for

1413
00:52:07,199 --> 00:52:11,358
difference

1414
00:52:08,239 --> 00:52:13,838
and and so is the difference in the day

1415
00:52:11,358 --> 00:52:16,719
and night temperature

1416
00:52:13,838 --> 00:52:17,920
and in a natural situation bites are

1417
00:52:16,719 --> 00:52:20,558
cooler than the

1418
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:22,639
than the days are so there is a positive

1419
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:26,079
difference let's say

1420
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:28,799
it's uh 65 degrees at night

1421
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:30,880
75 degrees during the day so that's a

1422
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:35,839
positive 10 degree

1423
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:38,640
diff you lower that difference

1424
00:52:35,838 --> 00:52:39,599
and even going to a negative diff you

1425
00:52:38,639 --> 00:52:42,719
create

1426
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:45,039
shorter internodes smaller plants

1427
00:52:42,719 --> 00:52:47,039
very very similar to a peclobutrizol

1428
00:52:45,039 --> 00:52:50,639
effect

1429
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:51,279
so in a greenhouse or in any controlled

1430
00:52:50,639 --> 00:52:53,199
environment

1431
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:55,119
you have the capability of controlling

1432
00:52:53,199 --> 00:52:58,000
your day and night temperatures

1433
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:58,880
and so instead of getting a 10 degree

1434
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,559
difference you

1435
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:06,960
lower it to say two degrees or zero

1436
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:06,960
you'll see a much more compact plant

1437
00:53:07,039 --> 00:53:10,639
you can take it one step further i'm

1438
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:12,240
sorry

1439
00:53:10,639 --> 00:53:14,078
i wasn't aware that that's really

1440
00:53:12,239 --> 00:53:15,118
interesting so the smaller the

1441
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:16,720
difference so the

1442
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:19,280
smaller the internet yeah and you can

1443
00:53:16,719 --> 00:53:22,480
take it one step further

1444
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:23,599
is that if you make your nighttime

1445
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:26,000
temperature

1446
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:26,640
cooler i mean warmer than your daytime

1447
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,440
temperature

1448
00:53:26,639 --> 00:53:32,000
so let's say your nighttime temperature

1449
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:34,559
is 70 degrees and your day temperature

1450
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:37,440
is 68 degrees you'll have an even more

1451
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:37,440
compact plant

1452
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:42,319
i mean there's some challenges around

1453
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:44,559
that with lighting and there's

1454
00:53:42,318 --> 00:53:46,400
definitely some there's definitely some

1455
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:49,359
challenges

1456
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:50,800
now particularly in a greenhouse kind of

1457
00:53:49,358 --> 00:53:53,039
setting where you're doing natural

1458
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:56,559
ventilation

1459
00:53:53,039 --> 00:53:57,920
there is an important period that is

1460
00:53:56,559 --> 00:54:01,200
about one hour

1461
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:05,119
before sunrise and

1462
00:54:01,199 --> 00:54:08,318
two to three hours after sunrise

1463
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:10,318
and that's when in a 24 hour period the

1464
00:54:08,318 --> 00:54:12,800
plant is most responsive to this

1465
00:54:10,318 --> 00:54:14,558
differences in temperature so there's a

1466
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:15,200
technique that's sometimes called the

1467
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:18,000
morning

1468
00:54:15,199 --> 00:54:20,159
dip so if you're going through the night

1469
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,838
your temperature is 70 degrees

1470
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:24,799
during the night about an hour before

1471
00:54:22,838 --> 00:54:26,880
sunrise

1472
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:28,400
lower the temperature to something like

1473
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:31,440
65

1474
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:33,200
and then keep it low for about three

1475
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:35,200
hours after sunrise

1476
00:54:33,199 --> 00:54:36,480
and then it go let it go up to a natural

1477
00:54:35,199 --> 00:54:38,639
day temperature

1478
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:41,119
that will give you the most compact

1479
00:54:38,639 --> 00:54:43,519
plant you can get

1480
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:45,358
wow now there's there's quite a bit of

1481
00:54:43,519 --> 00:54:46,159
information on this we can't go into all

1482
00:54:45,358 --> 00:54:48,318
of it but there's

1483
00:54:46,159 --> 00:54:49,759
i sort of threw the big picture at you

1484
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:53,599
real quick there

1485
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:56,880
uh you can just do a internet search

1486
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:59,359
for uh plant

1487
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:00,880
response to death or difference in day

1488
00:54:59,358 --> 00:55:02,798
and night temperature

1489
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:05,119
and you'll find quite a bit of

1490
00:55:02,798 --> 00:55:06,480
information this is pretty widely used

1491
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:08,160
in uh

1492
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:10,240
and flower crops that are used in

1493
00:55:08,159 --> 00:55:14,960
greenhouses

1494
00:55:10,239 --> 00:55:17,039
um and that's a good technique now i

1495
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:19,119
have not done it on cannabis

1496
00:55:17,039 --> 00:55:20,558
and i don't know anyone who is i'm

1497
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:22,000
guessing there's some folks out there i

1498
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:23,280
know some consultants that are very

1499
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,519
familiar with this

1500
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:27,200
so i'm guessing that there are some

1501
00:55:25,519 --> 00:55:29,838
folks that are playing with it

1502
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:31,679
uh but it definitely works and cannabis

1503
00:55:29,838 --> 00:55:34,480
looks like it would be a

1504
00:55:31,679 --> 00:55:35,919
perfect crop to to try this out now at

1505
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:38,318
the same time

1506
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:39,039
uh everyone's dealing with humidity

1507
00:55:38,318 --> 00:55:41,920
issues

1508
00:55:39,039 --> 00:55:43,279
you'll if so it works best if you're in

1509
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:45,119
a situation where you can manage

1510
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:48,720
humidity at the same time

1511
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:51,358
at least on cannabis yeah

1512
00:55:48,719 --> 00:55:52,480
that's really interesting i i hope to

1513
00:55:51,358 --> 00:55:54,558
hear from people that

1514
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:55,599
that are to do more research on this and

1515
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:58,720
experiment

1516
00:55:55,599 --> 00:56:01,280
um yeah that doesn't it definitely works

1517
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:02,078
it definitely works great one of the

1518
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:04,160
nice things about

1519
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:06,000
it compared to using type of buca salt

1520
00:56:04,159 --> 00:56:07,519
is when you put pack of glucose all in

1521
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,639
the plant when you put it in the system

1522
00:56:07,519 --> 00:56:11,440
it's there

1523
00:56:08,639 --> 00:56:13,279
this depth concept you can manipulate it

1524
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:14,960
and give it two or three

1525
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:16,640
days one way and two or three days

1526
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:17,920
another way so you

1527
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:19,838
you know if you want the plants a little

1528
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:20,559
taller you can give it make it a little

1529
00:56:19,838 --> 00:56:22,960
more

1530
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:24,640
positive if you want them compact you

1531
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:26,000
you know they'll respond within two or

1532
00:56:24,639 --> 00:56:29,440
three days

1533
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:32,000
very turn it on and off yeah

1534
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:33,599
it's great well anything more on that or

1535
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:37,119
do you want to jump into

1536
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:40,798
uh jasmonic acid gas lonic acid

1537
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:43,200
um yeah this is this is one that's

1538
00:56:40,798 --> 00:56:44,000
really interesting and there's tons and

1539
00:56:43,199 --> 00:56:47,199
tons of research

1540
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:51,199
being done by you know botanists

1541
00:56:47,199 --> 00:56:52,480
who are studying stress and plant

1542
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:56,879
hormones

1543
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:58,559
um and i know in the cannabis industry

1544
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:01,920
there's there's quite a bit of

1545
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:06,400
interest in it uh gasmonic acid

1546
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:09,760
is involved in stress response

1547
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:11,760
um response to the plant to natural

1548
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:14,079
stresses

1549
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:15,760
like temperature and drought stress but

1550
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:19,760
also response to

1551
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:20,960
insects and so it is part of the process

1552
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:24,559
of the plant

1553
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:26,639
of adjusting the way it's growing

1554
00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:28,400
to account for the stress that it's

1555
00:57:26,639 --> 00:57:30,318
under

1556
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:32,160
and there's potential uh i think i've

1557
00:57:30,318 --> 00:57:32,960
mentioned earlier that i think that in

1558
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:34,960
what we're doing

1559
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:36,318
in the way we're stressing plants we are

1560
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:39,760
causing the plant to

1561
00:57:36,318 --> 00:57:42,639
produ be producing its own gestatic acid

1562
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:44,640
as it would naturally do and general

1563
00:57:42,639 --> 00:57:47,838
jasonic acid reduces growth

1564
00:57:44,639 --> 00:57:50,639
that's in general um

1565
00:57:47,838 --> 00:57:51,838
but it's also working in the plant is

1566
00:57:50,639 --> 00:57:54,239
working with the other

1567
00:57:51,838 --> 00:57:55,838
hormones the gibberellins and ethylene

1568
00:57:54,239 --> 00:57:59,118
and iae

1569
00:57:55,838 --> 00:58:01,279
auxins to adjust that

1570
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:02,240
and as the stress level goes down the

1571
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:05,519
growth might go back

1572
00:58:02,239 --> 00:58:09,439
up and those kinds of things uh

1573
00:58:05,519 --> 00:58:11,440
there there is a gismonic acid product

1574
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:14,079
being sold on amazon i mean you can go

1575
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:15,280
buy it uh but there's no information

1576
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:18,400
about how to use it

1577
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:19,599
doses timing those kinds of things and i

1578
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:22,880
have seen

1579
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:25,680
i've seen the evidence that jasmine gets

1580
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:27,680
you know works on producing uh plants

1581
00:58:25,679 --> 00:58:28,719
treated with gizmodic acid produce more

1582
00:58:27,679 --> 00:58:32,480
terpenes

1583
00:58:28,719 --> 00:58:35,118
um but then there's a whole issue of the

1584
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:35,838
huge number of terpenes and how much you

1585
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:37,760
apply

1586
00:58:35,838 --> 00:58:39,119
and and things like that and how it

1587
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:42,799
affects some different uh

1588
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:42,798
strains um

1589
00:58:43,039 --> 00:58:48,239
and so right now

1590
00:58:46,159 --> 00:58:49,679
i don't know that anyone can tell you

1591
00:58:48,239 --> 00:58:53,199
this is what to do

1592
00:58:49,679 --> 00:58:54,719
to use and be successful with jasminic

1593
00:58:53,199 --> 00:58:56,960
acid on cannabis

1594
00:58:54,719 --> 00:58:58,719
um it looks like there is definitely

1595
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:01,119
some potential there

1596
00:58:58,719 --> 00:59:02,879
but like most of the hormone things

1597
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:06,640
there's so many ways that

1598
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:08,160
um that the hormones interact with

1599
00:59:06,639 --> 00:59:11,118
all the other conditions how much

1600
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:12,960
fertilizer we're using how much water

1601
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:14,160
it may be that we're already stressing

1602
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:15,920
the plants so much

1603
00:59:14,159 --> 00:59:18,000
that if you go out and start treating

1604
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:21,680
the gistmonic acid you get more negative

1605
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,000
effect so that's that's always a concern

1606
00:59:21,679 --> 00:59:24,399
too

1607
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,440
so while i think it is an interesting

1608
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:28,240
area to look at

1609
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:29,838
it's not one that uh you know if someone

1610
00:59:28,239 --> 00:59:30,798
feels like they're an earlier doctor

1611
00:59:29,838 --> 00:59:32,798
they might go

1612
00:59:30,798 --> 00:59:33,920
you know troll it a little bit but i

1613
00:59:32,798 --> 00:59:36,000
wouldn't go out there and

1614
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:36,960
you know got the farm on it that kind of

1615
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:41,440
thing

1616
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:44,960
well jim is there any legal

1617
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:47,200
uses of jasminic acid on cannabis and

1618
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:48,159
i i don't know a lot about it how safe

1619
00:59:47,199 --> 00:59:51,199
is it i've seen

1620
00:59:48,159 --> 00:59:54,639
you know jazz space spray for roses

1621
00:59:51,199 --> 00:59:56,719
um but you know how how safe is it for

1622
00:59:54,639 --> 00:59:59,199
compared to say paclobetrizal or some of

1623
00:59:56,719 --> 01:00:00,798
these other pgrs

1624
00:59:59,199 --> 01:00:02,960
or is they all kind of that same

1625
01:00:00,798 --> 01:00:04,159
category of just untested and we don't

1626
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:06,720
really know

1627
01:00:04,159 --> 01:00:07,679
the safety it's absolutely untested yeah

1628
01:00:06,719 --> 01:00:10,798
i don't know of

1629
01:00:07,679 --> 01:00:12,639
any uh chasmonic acid

1630
01:00:10,798 --> 01:00:14,719
product that's being sold in agriculture

1631
01:00:12,639 --> 01:00:17,358
that has gone through the

1632
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:18,558
sort of rigors of testing that epa

1633
01:00:17,358 --> 01:00:21,598
requires

1634
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:23,599
okay um but my feeling is

1635
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:24,880
that it's it's going to be relatively

1636
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:26,838
safe but

1637
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:29,358
you know arsenic is a natural product

1638
01:00:26,838 --> 01:00:32,239
too

1639
01:00:29,358 --> 01:00:32,558
so we need to know more we absolutely

1640
01:00:32,239 --> 01:00:34,639
need

1641
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:37,200
more need need to know more but it's

1642
01:00:34,639 --> 01:00:39,838
definitely one that

1643
01:00:37,199 --> 01:00:40,798
you know i think has some uh potential

1644
01:00:39,838 --> 01:00:43,199
uses for us

1645
01:00:40,798 --> 01:00:44,239
it may be that the system that we're

1646
01:00:43,199 --> 01:00:46,798
currently using

1647
01:00:44,239 --> 01:00:48,558
isn't the best system it might be better

1648
01:00:46,798 --> 01:00:50,639
for us to

1649
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:52,559
do some more things to reduce stress

1650
01:00:50,639 --> 01:00:53,440
early in the crop and then stress it at

1651
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:55,280
the end

1652
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:57,838
with the gizmotic acid treatment for

1653
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:57,839
example

1654
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:02,079
that might be a better production system

1655
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:05,200
i would anticipate

1656
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:08,400
as you go up in scale and start

1657
01:01:05,199 --> 01:01:09,199
you doing larger production areas and

1658
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:12,480
trying to do

1659
01:01:09,199 --> 01:01:14,318
more exact timing that getting away from

1660
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:17,440
our current stresses

1661
01:01:14,318 --> 01:01:18,079
uh will make it more uniform and then if

1662
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:22,880
we can

1663
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:26,318
apply a naturally uh occurring material

1664
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:28,880
near the end of the crop to you know

1665
01:01:26,318 --> 01:01:30,400
uh jump that terpene production that's

1666
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:33,200
probably a better system

1667
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:33,519
and we might find that it's better to

1668
01:01:33,199 --> 01:01:36,558
just

1669
01:01:33,519 --> 01:01:38,960
use salt stress you know

1670
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:40,720
and and you know two weeks before

1671
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:44,960
harvest something like that as being

1672
01:01:40,719 --> 01:01:44,959
the way the best way to produce the crop

1673
01:01:45,039 --> 01:01:48,079
or light stress we just don't know don't

1674
01:01:47,358 --> 01:01:50,798
know right now

1675
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:52,318
i think the biggest takeaway i've gotten

1676
01:01:50,798 --> 01:01:56,079
from my conversation with you

1677
01:01:52,318 --> 01:01:59,838
uh today is is just an understanding

1678
01:01:56,079 --> 01:02:02,318
of what these pgrs are and how

1679
01:01:59,838 --> 01:02:03,358
how they work inside of a plant would

1680
01:02:02,318 --> 01:02:06,400
give a grower

1681
01:02:03,358 --> 01:02:09,199
a better understanding in terms of

1682
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:11,119
potential manipulation of you know plant

1683
01:02:09,199 --> 01:02:12,879
growth and plant stress

1684
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:14,960
so i i think just a better understanding

1685
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:16,960
of botany and

1686
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:18,079
you know some of these chemical

1687
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:21,838
reactions

1688
01:02:18,079 --> 01:02:21,839
is useful for a grower

1689
01:02:22,318 --> 01:02:25,920
i i think that's important i think

1690
01:02:24,318 --> 01:02:28,480
that's important you know i

1691
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:30,079
with my flower growers that i've worked

1692
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:33,119
with for years

1693
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:34,240
and doing growers seminars on how to use

1694
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:37,039
uh

1695
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:38,078
the inhibitors like factor but dissolve

1696
01:02:37,039 --> 01:02:40,799
and that kind of thing i

1697
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:42,720
i told the audience over and over again

1698
01:02:40,798 --> 01:02:45,519
if the question they asked me

1699
01:02:42,719 --> 01:02:46,480
is what ghost to put on or what rate to

1700
01:02:45,519 --> 01:02:50,400
use

1701
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:53,039
if my answer to that is don't use it

1702
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:53,680
because that is the last thing you

1703
01:02:53,039 --> 01:02:55,760
decide

1704
01:02:53,679 --> 01:02:56,879
after you look at all of the other

1705
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:58,480
inputs that you have

1706
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:00,880
your the differences in your

1707
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:02,960
temperatures your light levels the

1708
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:04,240
irrigation the strain that you're

1709
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:06,639
growing

1710
01:03:04,239 --> 01:03:08,318
all of that then you decide how much to

1711
01:03:06,639 --> 01:03:10,639
put on

1712
01:03:08,318 --> 01:03:12,239
and so it's it's there there's a lot of

1713
01:03:10,639 --> 01:03:16,078
potential but it's also

1714
01:03:12,239 --> 01:03:18,078
requires a more technical

1715
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:19,440
growing strategy i guess that was a way

1716
01:03:18,079 --> 01:03:21,839
to put it

1717
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:23,039
yeah and once again none of these you

1718
01:03:21,838 --> 01:03:24,960
know none of these chemicals that we

1719
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:26,559
mentioned are legal to use on cannabis

1720
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:28,240
and we're not certainly not

1721
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:30,160
encouraging growers to go out there and

1722
01:03:28,239 --> 01:03:33,038
use them um

1723
01:03:30,159 --> 01:03:34,639
right so that's the most important thing

1724
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:37,359
i want to highlight yeah

1725
01:03:34,639 --> 01:03:38,480
yeah and with with cannabis is

1726
01:03:37,358 --> 01:03:41,920
absolutely

1727
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:44,000
um you know right now in the us at least

1728
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:44,480
is look at your state requirements and

1729
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,318
what's

1730
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:48,000
legal to use in that state it varies

1731
01:03:46,318 --> 01:03:50,639
from state to state

1732
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,679
if you're across the border in canada

1733
01:03:50,639 --> 01:03:54,480
the same

1734
01:03:51,679 --> 01:03:55,038
absolute chemical may be legal in canada

1735
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:57,920
and not in

1736
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:58,559
anywhere in the u.s or vice versa yeah

1737
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:01,358
yeah

1738
01:03:58,559 --> 01:04:03,039
so it's it's all it's all gets down the

1739
01:04:01,358 --> 01:04:06,318
local regulations is

1740
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:08,160
and uh and all and if you you know

1741
01:04:06,318 --> 01:04:09,440
and then that that whole issue i think

1742
01:04:08,159 --> 01:04:11,199
more we're going to be doing more and

1743
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:13,200
more testing

1744
01:04:11,199 --> 01:04:15,118
and some of these things really last for

1745
01:04:13,199 --> 01:04:16,960
a long time in the plant

1746
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:19,280
you know honestly my motivation as an

1747
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:21,358
organic grower with this podcast was not

1748
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:23,280
only to educate people but to hopefully

1749
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:25,920
discourage them if they were using them

1750
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:27,920
and realize some of the potential risks

1751
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:29,838
associated with use not just to

1752
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:31,280
themselves but to the consumer

1753
01:04:29,838 --> 01:04:33,358
at the end of the day i know some people

1754
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:34,798
are are going to still continue to apply

1755
01:04:33,358 --> 01:04:35,598
these things but at least maybe they'll

1756
01:04:34,798 --> 01:04:37,679
have a little more

1757
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:38,798
education and hopefully consider not

1758
01:04:37,679 --> 01:04:39,279
using them in their grow if they are

1759
01:04:38,798 --> 01:04:40,798
because

1760
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:42,160
frankly it's illegal and i don't i

1761
01:04:40,798 --> 01:04:44,000
personally don't believe it to be safe

1762
01:04:42,159 --> 01:04:48,399
but we don't ultimately know

1763
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:51,039
and that that's the biggest thing um

1764
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:52,400
for people to be aware of so let's let's

1765
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:54,720
dive into this last question

1766
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:55,760
so you can get back to your uh get back

1767
01:04:54,719 --> 01:04:58,639
to your day

1768
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:59,920
uh i wanted to know about stability of

1769
01:04:58,639 --> 01:05:02,480
these pgrs because

1770
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:04,240
like for example you know i used to make

1771
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:06,798
willow water

1772
01:05:04,239 --> 01:05:08,639
to try and extract iba you know i've

1773
01:05:06,798 --> 01:05:11,440
experimented with kelp meal

1774
01:05:08,639 --> 01:05:12,239
and seaweed extract powder and uh

1775
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:15,039
alfalfa

1776
01:05:12,239 --> 01:05:16,239
you know trying to potentially capture

1777
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:19,280
natural sources

1778
01:05:16,239 --> 01:05:21,279
of these uh pgrs

1779
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:23,280
how stable are these like i wasn't aware

1780
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:26,240
of tricontinol being

1781
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:27,519
um so unstable to where i probably i you

1782
01:05:26,239 --> 01:05:29,759
know i was getting other benefits from

1783
01:05:27,519 --> 01:05:30,159
alfalfa but probably not the tricontinol

1784
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:31,440
so

1785
01:05:30,159 --> 01:05:33,920
like what about some of these other ones

1786
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:36,400
yeah uh

1787
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:37,599
you know it varies a lot the auxin

1788
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:40,720
materials that

1789
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:43,519
um that are used for brooding

1790
01:05:40,719 --> 01:05:44,879
uh the naturally occurring auxins tend

1791
01:05:43,519 --> 01:05:47,759
to be very unstable

1792
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:48,160
a little bit of exposure to light uh you

1793
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:51,440
know

1794
01:05:48,159 --> 01:05:53,118
and they break down um

1795
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:54,880
that's sort of the reason that we don't

1796
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:58,798
use naturally

1797
01:05:54,880 --> 01:06:01,119
natural iaa in in propagation we use the

1798
01:05:58,798 --> 01:06:05,280
synthetic materials that

1799
01:06:01,119 --> 01:06:08,798
hold up longer um

1800
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:11,200
and even yeah it you know it varies and

1801
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:13,280
and i haven't looked into this area

1802
01:06:11,199 --> 01:06:17,118
that's that's definitely an area that

1803
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:19,599
i have not uh not looked at so i can't

1804
01:06:17,119 --> 01:06:21,680
i can't answer your question directly uh

1805
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:23,359
other than it varies a lot

1806
01:06:21,679 --> 01:06:25,519
well i think you did you know we make

1807
01:06:23,358 --> 01:06:27,119
assumptions as grovers that

1808
01:06:25,519 --> 01:06:29,759
because we hear for example you know

1809
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:31,760
with alfalfa or with kelp that it

1810
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:33,599
contains auxins and gibralians and

1811
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:36,559
cytokines that we're

1812
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:38,880
when we apply it we're getting them but

1813
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:42,480
essentially what you're saying is that

1814
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:44,240
potentially these these pgrs are not as

1815
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:45,519
stable and they may not be making it we

1816
01:06:44,239 --> 01:06:46,000
may not be getting that effect we may be

1817
01:06:45,519 --> 01:06:47,920
getting other

1818
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:50,318
effects but not necessarily the

1819
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:53,200
purported benefits of pgrs

1820
01:06:50,318 --> 01:06:54,400
is that fair to say uh that i think

1821
01:06:53,199 --> 01:06:56,879
that's very fair to say

1822
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:57,680
okay well naturally occurring but here

1823
01:06:56,880 --> 01:07:00,960
the natural

1824
01:06:57,679 --> 01:07:03,038
occurring hormones in the plant tend to

1825
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:04,079
break down fast that's one of the ways

1826
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:08,240
that they regulate

1827
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:09,760
the plant regulates what's going on um

1828
01:07:08,239 --> 01:07:11,519
and so when you and then when you get

1829
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:13,599
into

1830
01:07:11,519 --> 01:07:14,559
you know a system where you're applying

1831
01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:16,480
them

1832
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:17,760
natural products you've got that same

1833
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:21,119
issue a little bit

1834
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:23,599
what is the processing gun uh you know

1835
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:26,160
things like the auxins that they break

1836
01:07:23,599 --> 01:07:29,760
down at high temperatures uh

1837
01:07:26,159 --> 01:07:32,078
you know the processing uh

1838
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:34,000
you know may break it down and so it may

1839
01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:36,318
not be very high levels in the final

1840
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,318
product

1841
01:07:37,199 --> 01:07:41,038
well thank you so much for your time

1842
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:42,639
today i really appreciate it i

1843
01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:45,359
i learned quite a bit of stuff about
