00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:18,960
welcome to the cannabis cultivation and

3
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:21,330
science podcast

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,640
I'm your host tad hussy of KISS organics

5
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:24,929
this is the podcast where we discuss the

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,910
cutting edge of growing from a

7
00:00:24,929 --> 00:00:28,559
science-based perspective and drawn top

8
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,629
experts from around the industry to

9
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:33,179
share their wisdom and knowledge this

10
00:00:30,629 --> 00:00:34,890
week's podcast is all about lady bugs or

11
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:36,840
lady beetles as they are commonly known

12
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,429
and why you should never purchase them

13
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,800
online or in a garden center

14
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:42,988
one other thing to mention if you find

15
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:44,699
this podcast as fascinating as I did you

16
00:00:42,988 --> 00:00:48,149
should check out the lost ladybug

17
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:50,129
project at lost ladybug org you can find

18
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:51,929
and photograph local ladybugs and send

19
00:00:50,128 --> 00:00:54,269
them to entomologist at Cornell for

20
00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:55,859
identification and data logging it seems

21
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:57,960
like a fun project to do with science

22
00:00:55,859 --> 00:00:59,460
minded kids or something I planned on

23
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,160
doing myself the next time I see an

24
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:04,079
interesting one in the wild my guest

25
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:06,179
this week is JP Michelle

26
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:08,700
dr. Michelle is a professor of

27
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,740
entomology at Kansas State University he

28
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,900
is an insect ecologist specializing in

29
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:14,938
biological control and other aspects of

30
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,009
crop protection entomology he has a

31
00:01:14,938 --> 00:01:18,449
background in evolutionary ecology and

32
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:19,859
many of his research endeavors are

33
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:21,719
guided by the implications of

34
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:23,280
evolutionary theory his interests

35
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:25,438
include cultural and conservation

36
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,349
approaches to biological control of

37
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:31,228
aphids in field crops ecology of the

38
00:01:28,349 --> 00:01:33,118
Coxon elodie which is a the proper word

39
00:01:31,228 --> 00:01:34,920
for lady beetles I learned and the

40
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:37,379
interface between host plant resistance

41
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,000
and biological control dr. Michel

42
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:40,890
completed his Bachelor of Science at

43
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,509
McGill University and his master's and

44
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:48,509
PhD at Simon Fraser University hey JP

45
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:50,849
thanks for coming on the show oh thanks

46
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:53,938
for inviting me yeah I got to hear you

47
00:01:50,849 --> 00:01:55,978
speak down at the bio Controls meeting

48
00:01:53,938 --> 00:01:57,929
last month in Portland and you were the

49
00:01:55,978 --> 00:02:00,478
keynote speaker it was a great talk I

50
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:03,930
really enjoyed it and one of the things

51
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:06,629
that you talked about was why people

52
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:09,599
should not be buying ladybugs or lady

53
00:02:06,629 --> 00:02:12,090
beetles as they're called can we talk a

54
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,409
little bit about what ladybugs are talk

55
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,770
a little about their lifecycle before we

56
00:02:13,409 --> 00:02:15,479
dive in

57
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:19,590
these reasons why they're they're not a

58
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:21,599
good idea to purchase oh sure and and to

59
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:23,849
be clear I'm referring to one particular

60
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:26,340
species of lady beetles that's harvested

61
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:28,799
from the wild but in terms of life

62
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:30,780
cycles they're all pretty similar so

63
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,590
let's cycle depending on temperature

64
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:38,270
we'll take about 25 to 30 days about a

65
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:41,700
month so they are they have a full

66
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:44,159
metamorphosis so egg larval pupil stages

67
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:47,519
followed by the adult and so both the

68
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:49,919
larval stage and the adult stage feed on

69
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:55,050
aphids and other small soft bodied

70
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:57,899
insects and the eggs of other insects so

71
00:02:55,050 --> 00:03:00,300
the larval stage is gonna last anywhere

72
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:02,430
from I would say 14 to 20 days and

73
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:03,840
that's the period where they're

74
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:06,110
consuming aphids and of course the

75
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,599
bigger they get the more they consume

76
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:12,630
now the adults can live quite a variable

77
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:14,609
period of time they also feed on aphids

78
00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:16,289
but the females eat a lot more assets

79
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:19,950
than the males especially when they're

80
00:03:16,289 --> 00:03:22,709
producing eggs but come fall and shorter

81
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:24,179
days cooler temperatures different lady

82
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:26,430
meals have different strategies for

83
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:28,860
surviving the winter most of them in

84
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:32,459
North America go into some kind of diet

85
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:34,620
pause they hibernate just like other

86
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:38,280
animals do in winter so they become

87
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:39,900
dormant and very quiescent and then when

88
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,390
they're and they remain that way until

89
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:44,959
spring so in the fall generation they

90
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:47,309
can live as long as six to eight months

91
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,840
but once they start reproducing in the

92
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,250
spring then they start dying very

93
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,890
quickly but then you have another

94
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:55,770
generation so for example here in

95
00:03:52,889 --> 00:03:58,919
Central where I am in central North

96
00:03:55,770 --> 00:04:01,469
America the number of generations per

97
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:03,839
year will vary from anywhere from two to

98
00:04:01,469 --> 00:04:06,389
five depending on the availability of

99
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,770
aces now out here in the high plains

100
00:04:06,389 --> 00:04:09,779
it's harder for them to survive the

101
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:11,670
summer than it is the winter when it's

102
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:13,669
hot and dry because there's no ancients

103
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:16,079
so they actually go into a type of

104
00:04:13,669 --> 00:04:16,918
different type of diet pause we call

105
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,959
estivation

106
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:20,699
so they're still active they're out and

107
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,310
about trying to glean a bit of foods

108
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:27,209
stay hydrated but they're not

109
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:28,860
reproducing and they do that if you stop

110
00:04:27,209 --> 00:04:30,870
reproducing they can live several two or

111
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:32,430
three months even in the summer but

112
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:35,459
again once they find a good patch of

113
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:38,098
aphids they start to produce eggs the

114
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:40,649
females will will again start dying very

115
00:04:38,098 --> 00:04:42,329
quickly so there's the trade-off to diet

116
00:04:40,649 --> 00:04:45,179
plus when you do reproduce you reproduce

117
00:04:42,329 --> 00:04:48,750
less but it's better than reproducing

118
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:53,910
when there's no food around mmm that's

119
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:56,310
really interesting I know that I've seen

120
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:59,220
different types of ladybugs in my area

121
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:01,740
up here in Seattle some that look more

122
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:03,150
like what I would see available in like

123
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,560
you said when you go to a store or

124
00:05:03,149 --> 00:05:06,508
garden center you a lot of times you'll

125
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,930
see them there in the little bags moving

126
00:05:06,509 --> 00:05:12,330
around how many different species of

127
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:15,060
ladybugs are there approximately in a

128
00:05:12,329 --> 00:05:17,899
given area and and is there an easy way

129
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:20,908
to tell them apart

130
00:05:17,899 --> 00:05:22,859
well they are cool because lady beetles

131
00:05:20,908 --> 00:05:26,579
are what we call Apple somatic so most

132
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:28,830
of them produce a kind of bad tasting

133
00:05:26,579 --> 00:05:32,339
alkaloid in their blood you know which

134
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:33,598
makes them very distasteful for birds so

135
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:35,310
they're brightly colored to advertise

136
00:05:33,598 --> 00:05:38,969
that and so because of that they have a

137
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:41,129
very very distinctive coloration pattern

138
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:42,990
so they're not as far as insects go

139
00:05:41,129 --> 00:05:45,478
they're pretty easy to tell apart but

140
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:47,610
you there's hundreds of species and you

141
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:50,519
still really have to know the common

142
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:52,259
species around are a very abundant and

143
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:54,120
everybody will recognize those but

144
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:55,500
there's a lot of rare species that are

145
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,418
probably in areas where you don't see

146
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:59,759
them as often and some of them are

147
00:05:57,418 --> 00:06:01,740
extremely small as small as two

148
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,199
millimeters across so most people are

149
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:06,509
unaware some of us eat just mites so

150
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:10,050
there's a lot of there's a lot of

151
00:06:06,509 --> 00:06:11,250
different species but the most the ones

152
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:14,189
that most people are going to be

153
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:16,709
familiar with there's probably three to

154
00:06:14,189 --> 00:06:19,709
five very common species that occur all

155
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:21,388
across North America and one of those of

156
00:06:19,709 --> 00:06:24,408
course is the one you're seeing that

157
00:06:21,389 --> 00:06:27,090
people sell in these bags or containers

158
00:06:24,408 --> 00:06:29,579
it's called the convergent lady beetle

159
00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:32,728
HIPAA Damien convergence and this is the

160
00:06:29,579 --> 00:06:36,149
one that is sold by mail order all over

161
00:06:32,728 --> 00:06:38,990
the country and probably should not be

162
00:06:36,149 --> 00:06:40,919
allowed by law

163
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:43,560
unfortunately because the beetle itself

164
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:48,060
is widely distributed as a species

165
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:50,339
there is no regulatory control of this

166
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:51,899
and so what were people are doing now

167
00:06:50,339 --> 00:06:54,179
the interesting thing about HIPAA damia

168
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:57,060
in a mountainous area like in central in

169
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:58,949
the Sierra Nevadas of California in the

170
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:01,470
fall they form aggregations to go into

171
00:06:58,949 --> 00:07:03,060
this hibernation state so you can

172
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:04,350
actually people actually go up there and

173
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,509
they find these sites and they can

174
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:08,790
shovel them into buckets that's how many

175
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:12,719
there are and so they're collecting

176
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:14,520
these beetles for free and so this has

177
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,010
really put all the people who used to

178
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:18,599
rear and cell lady beetles out of

179
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:20,310
business because it doesn't cost

180
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,500
anything to shovel them into buckets but

181
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:24,420
it costs a lot to rear them in a

182
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,579
laboratory and yet these are the very

183
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:29,910
these beetles should not be shipped

184
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:32,189
because first of all let's get to

185
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:33,990
efficacy these are the old beetles that

186
00:07:32,189 --> 00:07:36,120
have survived the winter so the females

187
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:38,790
are very little lay eggs left in them

188
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,920
and they're held in cold storage so once

189
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:42,870
you bring them out of cold storage you

190
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,790
know they're there automatic response is

191
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:45,840
to fly away because they're way up in

192
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:48,240
the mountains and they have to come down

193
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:50,159
the valley in the natural situation to

194
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,980
find something to eat in the fields so

195
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,210
they don't tend to stay where you know

196
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:55,379
people release all these beetles in

197
00:07:54,209 --> 00:07:57,599
their garden they come back next day

198
00:07:55,379 --> 00:07:59,129
there's nothing there now if you have a

199
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:02,460
greenhouse you can contain some of that

200
00:07:59,129 --> 00:08:03,990
too but what you really want ideally and

201
00:08:02,459 --> 00:08:05,609
releasing adults you want them to lay

202
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:07,530
some eggs because it's those larvae that

203
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:09,509
are going to be diligent about combing

204
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:13,619
every plant and getting every last acid

205
00:08:09,509 --> 00:08:15,180
and and again these older beetles

206
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,709
they're hardly they don't have any eggs

207
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:19,620
left in them they're like little old

208
00:08:16,709 --> 00:08:22,889
ladies with canes at that point and so

209
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:25,709
they're really not very effective but

210
00:08:22,889 --> 00:08:28,019
there's bigger and more to be more

211
00:08:25,709 --> 00:08:30,269
concerning ecological issues which is

212
00:08:28,019 --> 00:08:32,370
the fact that they are have their own

213
00:08:30,269 --> 00:08:33,990
little ecosystem associated with them so

214
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:39,029
they're they have parasites they have

215
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:41,340
diseases and those diseases and the

216
00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:43,259
whole suite of organisms associated with

217
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:45,300
those beetles in California is not going

218
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:47,069
to be the same as that occurring in

219
00:08:45,299 --> 00:08:48,809
other parts of the country so when we're

220
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:50,040
moving these things around and mailing

221
00:08:48,809 --> 00:08:51,869
them across the country we're also

222
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:53,549
redistributing their diseases

223
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:56,429
they're natural enemies to other

224
00:08:53,549 --> 00:08:58,379
beneficial populations which may not

225
00:08:56,429 --> 00:09:01,829
have the same level of resistance or

226
00:08:58,379 --> 00:09:04,799
co-adaptation to these diseases and

227
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:06,150
parasites okay that's one thing another

228
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:08,069
thing is they have very different

229
00:09:06,149 --> 00:09:09,959
behaviors even the same species

230
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:12,060
different populations and very different

231
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,800
behaviors here and for example in the

232
00:09:12,059 --> 00:09:16,919
high plains than they do on the coast or

233
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:19,199
where you are up in Seattle a completely

234
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:21,299
different climate weather systems even

235
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,220
different patterns of prey utilization

236
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:25,349
without what they can survive on what

237
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:29,100
they can't dramatic differences between

238
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:30,540
populations and so when your mother's

239
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,278
beetles around and they leave and they

240
00:09:30,539 --> 00:09:34,769
get out they ain't going they interbreed

241
00:09:32,278 --> 00:09:36,960
with the local populations and so what

242
00:09:34,769 --> 00:09:39,360
we have a term for that we call is

243
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:41,339
genetic admixture so they don't have the

244
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,500
genetics appropriate for that region so

245
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:44,700
they're actually whatever traits they're

246
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,500
conferring when they interbreed with

247
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:48,330
local populations are not going to be

248
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:50,039
suited to those areas so it's just

249
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:54,110
another way we're weakening local

250
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:55,740
populations these beetles by you know

251
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:58,019
distributing them all over the country

252
00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:01,769
to habitats and environments they they

253
00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:03,360
don't come from yeah I want to kind of

254
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:05,039
highlight that point cuz I think that's

255
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,080
really crucial what you're saying there

256
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:10,679
so this idea that even though you may

257
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:11,820
find the same species in another part of

258
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:14,549
the country from where they're

259
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:17,600
originally harvested they're gonna their

260
00:10:14,549 --> 00:10:19,859
behavior is going to be different their

261
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,560
disease resistance is gonna be different

262
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:23,940
so we could actually assuming let's just

263
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:26,849
say in theory we had a greenhouse and we

264
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:29,580
had a few native lady lady beetles

265
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:31,860
already in there if we bring in if we

266
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:33,990
order online and bring in these other

267
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:36,750
wild harvested ones we could be in

268
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:38,519
theory really damaging those lady

269
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:40,200
beetles ability to protect our plants in

270
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:42,509
that greenhouse is that essentially what

271
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:45,420
you're getting at yeah a much larger

272
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:46,379
scale because you know it's not it's not

273
00:10:45,419 --> 00:10:48,208
gonna affect everything in the

274
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:50,159
greenhouse but it's gonna have the

275
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:51,809
potential for negative impacts on yes on

276
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:53,939
your local populations of the same

277
00:10:51,809 --> 00:10:56,009
species because there will have

278
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:57,660
completely different biology I can tell

279
00:10:56,009 --> 00:10:58,100
you this I've gone to see the hip edenia

280
00:10:57,659 --> 00:11:01,458
poor

281
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:03,829
convergence is in Puerto Rico it's lost

282
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:05,629
its ability to die apart but guess what

283
00:11:03,828 --> 00:11:08,809
I can see them some tropical aphids that

284
00:11:05,629 --> 00:11:10,189
you could put our you know would not

285
00:11:08,809 --> 00:11:12,948
even support the development and

286
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:16,579
survival of our populations and so it's

287
00:11:12,948 --> 00:11:19,189
acquired over over the years completely

288
00:11:16,578 --> 00:11:22,429
different set of adaptations and to

289
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:23,750
survive where it is and yeah you could

290
00:11:22,429 --> 00:11:24,828
still bring them here and interbreed

291
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:27,589
them with our beetles but then you'd

292
00:11:24,828 --> 00:11:29,958
have a mishmash of traits that in the in

293
00:11:27,589 --> 00:11:33,940
the hybrid progeny that really wouldn't

294
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:37,729
work well in either setting you know so

295
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:39,889
the the difference between these

296
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:41,120
different populations is remarkable as

297
00:11:39,889 --> 00:11:42,259
something that I've been studying for

298
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,139
over twenty years

299
00:11:42,259 --> 00:11:46,879
I mean there we we've done comparisons

300
00:11:45,139 --> 00:11:50,060
in our lab of hippedy Mia from Georgia

301
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:55,600
from California and from right here in

302
00:11:50,059 --> 00:11:57,619
in Kansas and I'll tell you for example

303
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,690
insecticide resistance the ones from

304
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:01,578
Georgia you can you can spray them all

305
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:03,439
day long with pyrethroids and and

306
00:12:01,578 --> 00:12:05,508
organophosphate insecticides and they

307
00:12:03,438 --> 00:12:07,730
don't even die I mean you can reach we

308
00:12:05,509 --> 00:12:09,949
basically reach the does the the

309
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:12,250
solubility limit of the insecticides and

310
00:12:09,948 --> 00:12:15,019
we couldn't kill them and over here

311
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:17,360
they'll just die at the drop of a hat

312
00:12:15,019 --> 00:12:18,560
and the reason for that is because in

313
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,970
Georgia they have a lot of cotton

314
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:22,578
production and it's very chemically

315
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:25,129
dependent so all the all the hippo

316
00:12:22,578 --> 00:12:27,289
Damien Georgia have this ridiculously

317
00:12:25,129 --> 00:12:29,000
high level of insecticide resistance

318
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:31,698
that you don't see in other populations

319
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,589
so that's something that we did you know

320
00:12:31,698 --> 00:12:35,750
as a result of our agricultural

321
00:12:33,589 --> 00:12:38,110
practices so imagine what nature has

322
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:41,688
done in terms of making them different

323
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:43,250
that's amazing I had no idea and the

324
00:12:41,688 --> 00:12:44,629
insecticide thing is really interesting

325
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:47,480
because that's sort of what we see with

326
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:49,429
a lot of our our pests and why bio

327
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:52,188
controls are so important is because we

328
00:12:49,429 --> 00:12:54,500
create these pesticidal resistances from

329
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:57,230
spraying all these these pesticides and

330
00:12:54,500 --> 00:13:03,289
insecticides you know consistently over

331
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:05,240
time on a given population you can go

332
00:13:03,289 --> 00:13:07,549
down to brazil and you've got completely

333
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:10,490
different species of [ __ ] and ellas

334
00:13:07,549 --> 00:13:11,609
that are abundant in cotton production

335
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:14,039
there

336
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:18,389
what they're resistant to pesticides do

337
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:21,179
now because they had to be Cox now

338
00:13:18,389 --> 00:13:25,289
that's the Dino campus is that the that

339
00:13:21,179 --> 00:13:28,979
you're talking about there I'm sorry I'm

340
00:13:25,289 --> 00:13:30,899
sorry for that I Carson Ellen is the the

341
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:34,440
generic term for lady beetle that's the

342
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:36,419
family Cox Adela tea so it's just a yeah

343
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:40,410
the coccynelle it is just a lady beetle

344
00:13:36,419 --> 00:13:44,639
in so what's the Dino campus Coxon Ella

345
00:13:40,409 --> 00:13:48,120
Dino campus a coccynelle II used to be

346
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:51,028
called a different name it's it's a

347
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:53,159
Hymenoptera s' parasitoid in the family

348
00:13:51,028 --> 00:13:55,528
bruh comedy so that's the family that

349
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:57,299
has a lot of different parasitoids

350
00:13:55,528 --> 00:13:59,039
including the little aphid Paris - it's

351
00:13:57,299 --> 00:14:00,809
they're all in that family these are

352
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:04,110
much bigger than the Ava desert read an

353
00:14:00,809 --> 00:14:07,588
interesting thing is they are all female

354
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:08,850
so they don't produce males and see

355
00:14:07,589 --> 00:14:10,620
there's a big advantage of that of

356
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:12,690
course because when they emerge from

357
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:15,209
their host in the spring they don't have

358
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:16,949
to look for a mate they can just go out

359
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:19,559
and start stinging beetles they attack

360
00:14:16,948 --> 00:14:23,278
the adult beetles and then the larvae

361
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:24,719
develops inside and crawls out of the

362
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:27,088
adult beetle and it's very interesting

363
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:30,930
because it's there's it's turning out to

364
00:14:27,089 --> 00:14:32,910
be a very complex relationship and the

365
00:14:30,929 --> 00:14:36,208
parasitoid doesn't just inject an egg

366
00:14:32,909 --> 00:14:38,458
and some it also injects some viruses

367
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:42,599
which modify the behavior of the beetle

368
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:45,208
and so what actually happens is once the

369
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:47,850
mature larvae exits through the anus of

370
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:51,049
the host it spins a cocoon because it's

371
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:54,120
a little wasp larvae but the adult

372
00:14:51,049 --> 00:14:56,219
beetle that's still alive clings to it

373
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:58,139
and protects it and stays alive for

374
00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:00,149
quite a few days and they've actually

375
00:14:58,139 --> 00:15:04,049
shown in the field that if you remove

376
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:06,600
the the old terrorized beetle from the

377
00:15:04,049 --> 00:15:08,639
cocoon of the parasitoid its survival is

378
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,230
greatly reduced so the parents so he

379
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,629
needs the beetles are sort of hug on to

380
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:15,180
it until it finishes its development it

381
00:15:12,629 --> 00:15:17,399
leaves behind this virus in the in the

382
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:19,078
beetle even efforts it's controlling the

383
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:23,370
behavior its host even after it's

384
00:15:19,078 --> 00:15:25,370
physically left it wow that's kind of

385
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:29,000
that sounds a little like Bavaria

386
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:30,950
this yes and and and again sponge I do

387
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,840
the same thing they alter the behavior

388
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:34,070
of their host before they kill it so

389
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:37,040
that they end up in a suitable

390
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:39,560
environment for their when there's a

391
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:41,360
dispersal but this so this is an

392
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:45,079
internal parasite though that's found

393
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:47,930
inside of harvested lady beetles that

394
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:51,440
will come back and kill your lady beetle

395
00:15:47,929 --> 00:15:54,079
or lady brought those harvested lady

396
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,970
beetles that the past toys are died

397
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:58,190
opposing inside the beetles so they're

398
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:59,750
hibernating inside their hosts they're

399
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:01,310
waiting for spring just like the beetles

400
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:04,940
are so there are there kind of

401
00:16:01,309 --> 00:16:07,879
metabolism is all on hold they're trying

402
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:09,950
to just you know slow down everything

403
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:11,210
and just stay alive until it's

404
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:12,980
springtime and of course when they

405
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:14,180
harvest the beetle they're and Mail them

406
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:16,250
all over country they're mailing the

407
00:16:14,179 --> 00:16:17,779
Pastorius and you can we've done it we

408
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:19,429
bought bags abby'll you can see air

409
00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:21,709
between five and 15 percent of those

410
00:16:19,429 --> 00:16:24,429
beetles are parasitized and it's not

411
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:26,750
just parasites they have different

412
00:16:24,429 --> 00:16:31,039
spiral plasmas and different types of

413
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:32,809
little parasitic bacterial infections

414
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:35,449
and things so chronic infections you

415
00:16:32,809 --> 00:16:37,489
know just like you can have a chronic a

416
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:39,050
sexually transmitted disease it's not

417
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:41,210
going to kill you but over the time it

418
00:16:39,049 --> 00:16:43,939
really you know I can really affect your

419
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:45,980
your your fitness and your health so

420
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:47,090
these beetles have their little sexually

421
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:50,360
transmitted diseases

422
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:51,889
literally and also mites that live on

423
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,930
the surface and suck their juices and

424
00:16:51,889 --> 00:16:57,230
all these kind of things so but of

425
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:58,849
course in within a localized population

426
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:01,159
that's isolated from others like on the

427
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:06,259
other side of the Rocky Mountains those

428
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:09,049
all of that ecology adapts you know to

429
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:10,759
what's around it and so the mites and

430
00:17:09,049 --> 00:17:12,619
the parasites well they over time

431
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:13,940
attenuate their impact because if they

432
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:15,289
kill they're too many hosts they kill

433
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:19,130
them too quickly then they don't have

434
00:17:15,289 --> 00:17:20,209
any hosts right so this complex truce is

435
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:22,010
sort of between all these different

436
00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:23,269
organisms but don't you take them and

437
00:17:22,009 --> 00:17:24,440
you throw them into a completely

438
00:17:23,269 --> 00:17:25,789
different population and they're

439
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:27,799
interbreeding and they're sharing all

440
00:17:25,789 --> 00:17:30,829
the psychology well those introduced

441
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:33,139
those populations where you said it may

442
00:17:30,829 --> 00:17:36,230
not very likely do not have the same

443
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:39,049
levels of resistance to those parasites

444
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:41,058
or diseases and so this is

445
00:17:39,048 --> 00:17:43,278
the ecological concern there that this

446
00:17:41,058 --> 00:17:44,839
is one of the most important species of

447
00:17:43,278 --> 00:17:47,058
lady beetle we have for controlling

448
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:48,589
Athens certainly here in Kansas but in

449
00:17:47,058 --> 00:17:52,249
many many agricultural settings

450
00:17:48,589 --> 00:17:54,648
worldwide continent-wide and by moving

451
00:17:52,249 --> 00:17:56,419
this population if everything from this

452
00:17:54,648 --> 00:17:58,398
one population in and spreading it all

453
00:17:56,419 --> 00:18:00,528
over the country we're actually you know

454
00:17:58,398 --> 00:18:05,589
doing more harm than good to our one of

455
00:18:00,528 --> 00:18:09,589
our most important species nationwide so

456
00:18:05,589 --> 00:18:11,898
if people want to utilize ladybugs or

457
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:14,808
lady beetles in their garden or attract

458
00:18:11,898 --> 00:18:16,278
naturally attract these ladybugs what do

459
00:18:14,808 --> 00:18:19,058
you recommend for people that want to

460
00:18:16,278 --> 00:18:21,980
promote lady Lady Bird ladybug health

461
00:18:19,058 --> 00:18:25,368
okay in our area same thing for

462
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:27,819
attracting parasitoids so is the natural

463
00:18:25,368 --> 00:18:29,808
attraction if you have a healthy little

464
00:18:27,819 --> 00:18:32,450
ecosystem in your garden or wherever

465
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:34,940
that will come by themselves now granted

466
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:37,038
some areas there's Ana landscape of fact

467
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:38,840
or some areas where they don't have good

468
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:41,079
reservoirs of lady beetles to attract

469
00:18:38,839 --> 00:18:44,118
them from you know if you're a very very

470
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:46,128
even well why shouldn't sit there's some

471
00:18:44,118 --> 00:18:48,589
species a few species that are thrive

472
00:18:46,128 --> 00:18:50,928
even in cities where you have just one

473
00:18:48,589 --> 00:18:52,388
little abandoned lot you'll have some

474
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:54,769
weeds or some aphids on you'll find

475
00:18:52,388 --> 00:18:56,178
certain species that will be there now

476
00:18:54,769 --> 00:18:59,980
it won't be the same diversity you'll

477
00:18:56,179 --> 00:19:02,769
find out in an in a wildlife reserve but

478
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:04,909
mostly if people have a live in an urban

479
00:19:02,769 --> 00:19:08,149
habitat where there's a patchwork of

480
00:19:04,909 --> 00:19:10,070
gardens and some floral resources you

481
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:11,599
should have a good reservoirs of natural

482
00:19:10,069 --> 00:19:13,579
enemies they should come by themselves

483
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:17,089
and what does it take it take flowering

484
00:19:13,579 --> 00:19:19,269
plants okay so if you look at all your

485
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:21,618
beneficial your different beneficial

486
00:19:19,269 --> 00:19:23,659
insects that we want whether it's

487
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:26,720
parasites whether it's predators like

488
00:19:23,659 --> 00:19:29,028
lace wings or lady beetles at some point

489
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,739
in their life stage at some point in

490
00:19:29,028 --> 00:19:34,069
their life cycle they need floral

491
00:19:30,739 --> 00:19:36,528
resources and for the adults beetles out

492
00:19:34,069 --> 00:19:39,048
here it's during the summer in the adult

493
00:19:36,528 --> 00:19:40,700
stage because sometimes the only source

494
00:19:39,048 --> 00:19:42,888
of moisture they can get is from a

495
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:45,649
flower in the form of nectar or extra

496
00:19:42,888 --> 00:19:50,209
floral nectar in some cases so the

497
00:19:45,648 --> 00:19:52,799
flowers act as an actual well or you

498
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:56,640
know as a source of moisture

499
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:58,799
in very dry situations and so but but

500
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:02,130
the pollen is also important because the

501
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:04,649
pollen is a source of protein and so it

502
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:07,620
can actually help them as a source of

503
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:09,990
protein now almost all lady beetles will

504
00:20:07,619 --> 00:20:11,209
feed on pollen and nectar very few of

505
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:13,799
them but some of them can actually

506
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:17,100
complete their whole lifecycle on just

507
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:18,569
pollen there's only one species that we

508
00:20:17,099 --> 00:20:20,730
know of but it's a very important one

509
00:20:18,569 --> 00:20:23,599
and that's the twelve spotted lady

510
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:25,920
beetle the pink one so it's very very

511
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:29,609
prolific it can eat a lot of different

512
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:31,950
things and so the point is flowers are

513
00:20:29,609 --> 00:20:34,259
going to attract them and they maybe

514
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:36,000
really need depending on their

515
00:20:34,259 --> 00:20:37,529
physiological condition they may really

516
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,240
need that pollen or nectar so they'll

517
00:20:37,529 --> 00:20:40,500
come for the flowers and if they find a

518
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:42,150
fitter than they lay on the aphids they

519
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:46,380
can smell the essence so they can find

520
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:49,410
the aphids quite well on their own but

521
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:51,450
yeah it's also devoting a certain is a

522
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:54,360
certain area of your garden to perennial

523
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:56,009
flowers will be really beneficial for

524
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:58,500
the average person and if you're growing

525
00:20:56,009 --> 00:21:00,900
in a greenhouse it's the same thing we

526
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:03,000
looked at high tunnel situations and you

527
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:07,440
you do better in a high tunnel situation

528
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:09,480
by putting lures which smell like plants

529
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,190
smelling all the Greenleaf volatiles

530
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:13,650
odors and things you can buy them and

531
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:16,140
then actually having some flowers they

532
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:17,970
are flowering and they will attract more

533
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:21,600
natural enemies that will do you more

534
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:23,569
good than actually releasing natural

535
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:25,799
enemies and try to contain them in there

536
00:21:23,569 --> 00:21:26,849
because they'll find a way out and if

537
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:30,329
they're not where they want to be

538
00:21:26,849 --> 00:21:31,859
they'll just find a way out and whereas

539
00:21:30,329 --> 00:21:33,029
if you produce the environment that's

540
00:21:31,859 --> 00:21:35,699
attractive they'll come all by

541
00:21:33,029 --> 00:21:37,970
themselves and I mentioned perennials

542
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:39,960
and outdoor settings because perennials

543
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:42,960
and outdoor settings you're probably

544
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:45,480
going to be worried about weeds and

545
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,860
certainly out where we are here but the

546
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,779
thing about Prairie all the weeds

547
00:21:46,859 --> 00:21:51,959
they're annuals they can't compete with

548
00:21:48,779 --> 00:21:53,849
perennials so if you can establish a

549
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:55,620
good perennial garden not only will

550
00:21:53,849 --> 00:21:58,289
leave you with a mix of species that

551
00:21:55,619 --> 00:22:00,359
flowers all summer long so some will

552
00:21:58,289 --> 00:22:03,000
flower early summer flower mid summer

553
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:04,439
for our late and the weeds will never

554
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,589
have a chance to establish because the

555
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,179
perennials are coming up and

556
00:22:05,589 --> 00:22:09,009
when they have the stored reserves in

557
00:22:07,179 --> 00:22:10,659
their roots and so they out-compete the

558
00:22:09,009 --> 00:22:14,650
weeds and then they give you a longer

559
00:22:10,659 --> 00:22:16,510
period of floral resources and so a

560
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:18,610
longer period of attractiveness for all

561
00:22:16,509 --> 00:22:20,019
those beneficial insects and again you

562
00:22:18,609 --> 00:22:23,229
know the same thing are going to benefit

563
00:22:20,019 --> 00:22:28,210
pollinators if you have a crop that

564
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:29,860
needs pollinators you know so you're

565
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:32,409
doing a double good thing when you do

566
00:22:29,859 --> 00:22:34,839
that you're not just benefiting the

567
00:22:32,409 --> 00:22:38,679
beneficials that eat your past you're

568
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:39,579
benefiting pollinators you know one

569
00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:42,669
thing we haven't talked about is

570
00:22:39,579 --> 00:22:45,599
pesticides you mentioned that the ones I

571
00:22:42,669 --> 00:22:48,340
think you said it was Georgia are highly

572
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:50,889
resistant to pesticides but in general

573
00:22:48,339 --> 00:22:54,459
what sorts of effects do traditional or

574
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:57,970
even organic applications of pesticides

575
00:22:54,460 --> 00:23:01,000
have on on Lady Bird populations well

576
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:02,470
that's a deep topic but you know the

577
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,990
older materials that were not very

578
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:07,058
selective the contact insecticides we

579
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:11,019
were using up until the end of the 20th

580
00:23:07,058 --> 00:23:13,298
century mostly are all neurotoxins and

581
00:23:11,019 --> 00:23:14,679
so yes there's certain populations of

582
00:23:13,298 --> 00:23:16,808
lady beetles that I've had so many

583
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:19,659
generations of exposure what they really

584
00:23:16,808 --> 00:23:22,349
have is high titers of enzymes that can

585
00:23:19,659 --> 00:23:25,600
detoxify these things but really fast

586
00:23:22,349 --> 00:23:27,778
but in the last 20 years we've had there

587
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:30,158
are a lot of really good more selective

588
00:23:27,778 --> 00:23:31,450
insecticides that are for example just

589
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:36,010
kill ace it's okay

590
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:37,778
and they don't there's there's a lot of

591
00:23:36,009 --> 00:23:40,569
safer materials that won't harm the lady

592
00:23:37,778 --> 00:23:42,369
beetles at all now they're a little more

593
00:23:40,569 --> 00:23:44,319
expensive but they're really selective

594
00:23:42,369 --> 00:23:46,719
because they act on you know they'll

595
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:48,308
usually be a systemic get absorbed by

596
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,259
the plant and then the aphid tries to

597
00:23:48,308 --> 00:23:54,339
feed and such juices and the juices of

598
00:23:50,259 --> 00:23:56,230
the plant and then the aphid dies but

599
00:23:54,339 --> 00:23:57,639
not all systemic materials are safe for

600
00:23:56,230 --> 00:24:00,009
example the most popular one is probably

601
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:01,990
the worst the imidacloprid and the

602
00:24:00,009 --> 00:24:05,349
thymus toxin that group there are

603
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:08,109
actually very very toxic to all natural

604
00:24:05,349 --> 00:24:10,028
enemies and so their uses their

605
00:24:08,109 --> 00:24:12,879
widespread use of seed treatment is

606
00:24:10,028 --> 00:24:14,890
another as a seed treatment is another

607
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,690
source of concern because again you're

608
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:18,340
you know that's basically a

609
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:19,330
scorched-earth policy you want no

610
00:24:18,339 --> 00:24:20,649
insects on your crop

611
00:24:19,329 --> 00:24:24,519
client you'll have no natural enemies

612
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:26,560
when the seed treatment wears off yeah

613
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:28,420
plus these systemic pesticides just

614
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:30,429
should not be used on edible crops

615
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:31,630
they're not they're not legal but for

616
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:33,670
people that aren't growing legally

617
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:37,410
there's a lot of concerns for this

618
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:40,090
safety and efficacy of them in terms of

619
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:44,259
consumers consuming or combusting a

620
00:24:40,089 --> 00:24:45,759
final cannabis product yes yes and you

621
00:24:44,259 --> 00:24:47,470
know I'm not sure about the regulations

622
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:48,910
and all of that but I can guarantee you

623
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:50,200
there's a lot of stuff you could use to

624
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:52,800
kill a fit so it's going to work really

625
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:56,980
well but you don't want that in your bud

626
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:59,740
yeah exam I know in Canada that's part

627
00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:01,839
of their national program all that stuff

628
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:04,750
has to be tested the residues just like

629
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:06,459
food because there is that temptation

630
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:09,089
for people to use things should give

631
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:10,900
this I mean if you can use the stomach

632
00:25:09,089 --> 00:25:13,179
insecticides Ava's aren't hard to

633
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:16,140
control but the problem is many of those

634
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:18,460
are some amongst the most toxic of all

635
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:20,680
insecticides you can go all the way back

636
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:22,990
to all the carb which is banned now I

637
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:24,880
think in most applications is just so

638
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:27,279
toxic to everything you see to be

639
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:30,070
systemic in a plant you usually have a

640
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:31,899
water soluble molecule that's more

641
00:25:30,069 --> 00:25:34,450
linear so it can travel through the

642
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:35,890
plants vascular system that means it's

643
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:42,430
going to travel into you pretty easily

644
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:43,840
too yeah definitely yeah so you know

645
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:45,549
there's a lot of stuff that you shared

646
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:48,519
today that I had no idea about lady

647
00:25:45,549 --> 00:25:50,379
beetles even more from more so than your

648
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:52,900
your keynote speech that's really

649
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:54,040
fascinating do you have anything else

650
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:56,590
that you just would like to share

651
00:25:54,039 --> 00:25:58,899
regarding these lady beetles it's sort

652
00:25:56,589 --> 00:26:01,299
of maybe some interesting facts or other

653
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:02,740
information before we sign off well

654
00:26:01,299 --> 00:26:04,299
there's nothing wrong with the idea

655
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:06,910
about mending lady beetles in a

656
00:26:04,299 --> 00:26:10,109
greenhouse setting but if we could get

657
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:13,450
some that were mass reared safely in

658
00:26:10,109 --> 00:26:14,979
secretary conditions you know and one of

659
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:17,200
the candidates might be harmonious

660
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:20,019
Carrodus which is the Asian multicolored

661
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:22,450
lady ballistic tremendously a voracious

662
00:26:20,019 --> 00:26:25,299
predator of aphids in so many different

663
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:27,340
cropping systems and I know it's present

664
00:26:25,299 --> 00:26:29,470
in hop orchards and places like that so

665
00:26:27,339 --> 00:26:30,439
it probably did fine in cannabis it

666
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:32,000
doesn't you know

667
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:34,759
has good Asians it'll go out almost any

668
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,519
plan but at these things would not be

669
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:39,470
hard to rear in the laboratory in large

670
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:41,120
numbers but the problem is you know I

671
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:42,319
don't know anybody that does it because

672
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:44,658
they can't compete with the ones that

673
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:46,730
are being wild collected yet no one

674
00:26:44,659 --> 00:26:48,169
should be using but if you can rear them

675
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:50,269
there'd be nothing wrong with augmenting

676
00:26:48,169 --> 00:26:52,970
lady beetles in a greenhouse if you had

677
00:26:50,269 --> 00:26:54,558
a sustainable system and that's another

678
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:57,048
thing we don't know how sustainable all

679
00:26:54,558 --> 00:26:58,849
that harvesting of the lady beetles will

680
00:26:57,048 --> 00:27:00,440
be over in California eventually though

681
00:26:58,849 --> 00:27:03,769
they may start depressing those

682
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:06,288
populations but yeah there's nothing

683
00:27:03,769 --> 00:27:07,700
wrong with the concept of amending lady

684
00:27:06,288 --> 00:27:10,220
beetles if you could have some that were

685
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:13,370
massive weird and you knew they didn't

686
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:14,419
have any parasites and you knew you

687
00:27:13,369 --> 00:27:16,638
could read you knew they were young

688
00:27:14,419 --> 00:27:18,288
beetles how old they were that they were

689
00:27:16,638 --> 00:27:20,119
gonna start reproducing in a couple of

690
00:27:18,288 --> 00:27:22,369
days and lay a lot of eggs all over your

691
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:24,589
playing and all that would be great but

692
00:27:22,369 --> 00:27:28,699
I don't see that we have that system in

693
00:27:24,589 --> 00:27:30,709
place so if you have an open system

694
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:33,889
where you can have devote a little space

695
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:35,808
to some floor of some floral resources

696
00:27:33,888 --> 00:27:37,250
planning some floral resources you're

697
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:38,480
going to attract your own lady beetles

698
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:40,638
and you're going to attract a lot of

699
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:44,808
other beneficial insects not just lady

700
00:27:40,638 --> 00:27:45,979
