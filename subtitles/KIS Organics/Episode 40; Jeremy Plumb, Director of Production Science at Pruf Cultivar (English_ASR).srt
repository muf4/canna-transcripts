years ago now at photo X but I'd been

59
00:02:24,669 --> 00:02:28,000
aware of you and the work you're doing

60
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:29,950
but I loved I loved what you talked

61
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,240
about on stage I just I was just sitting

62
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:33,369
there in the audience totally engaged

63
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:35,740
and nodding my head to just about

64
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:37,450
everything you were saying so I'm really

65
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:39,640
excited for this opportunity to talk to

66
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:40,989
you could you maybe go back and tell us

67
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:43,059
a little bit about yourself so we can

68
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:44,640
let the audience know who you are and

69
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:47,229
what you're up to

70
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:49,509
absolutely thanks for the compliment I

71
00:02:47,229 --> 00:02:51,549
really love that event that it's great

72
00:02:49,509 --> 00:02:53,109
to have a moment with you I'm a little

73
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:55,000
bit about my background is that I've

74
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:57,850
really always been involved with this

75
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,129
amazing class and doing my best to serve

76
00:02:57,849 --> 00:03:02,439
what I believe hurts you know in

77
00:03:00,129 --> 00:03:04,750
creating credibly growing in exciting

78
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:06,669
expressions in the world that of course

79
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:08,169
things are changing fast so there's a

80
00:03:06,669 --> 00:03:11,739
lot of fronts that I'm working on and

81
00:03:08,169 --> 00:03:14,829
that really I started in Sonoma County

82
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:16,540
and really had a lot of time in what we

83
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:19,360
sort of affectionately thought was the

84
00:03:16,539 --> 00:03:21,370
southern tip of the Emerald triangle but

85
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,380
what I was surrounded by really

86
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:26,200
experienced craft cannabis growers and

87
00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:28,509
was lucky when I was 15 after reading

88
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:30,699
the Emperor wears no clothes to be able

89
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:33,729
to reach out to Chris Conrad and Mickey

90
00:03:30,699 --> 00:03:35,169
Norris and sort of say hey I'm really

91
00:03:33,729 --> 00:03:37,659
excited about the work you guys are

92
00:03:35,169 --> 00:03:40,389
doing and to be taken in under their

93
00:03:37,659 --> 00:03:42,789
wing for a while um I got to go and

94
00:03:40,389 --> 00:03:45,250
Oakland and sort of spend time with

95
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:47,769
Chris especially as he was doing a lot

96
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:50,919
of different advocacy work this is pre

97
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:52,900
prop 215 in the Bay Area and there was

98
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:55,750
just this hotbed of a lot of the people

99
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:58,060
who are sort of most fundamental and the

100
00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:00,580
ideation room medical cannabis movement

101
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:02,949
and just the modern hemp and cannabis

102
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:04,570
movement in general um but one of the

103
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:07,000
first projects I was involved with was

104
00:04:04,569 --> 00:04:10,359
actually Nikki's project where she had

105
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,879
these sort of a-frame signs with big

106
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:15,400
posters about shattered lives and

107
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:17,500
people's lives that had been negatively

108
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,329
affected by the drug war and then there

109
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:21,339
was these anecdotes and we would tour

110
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:23,359
around and take them to various places

111
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:25,549
like college campuses and

112
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,490
sort of tell these stories of shattered

113
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:30,829
lives and illustrate that just painful

114
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:33,439
outcomes of the drug war during that

115
00:04:30,829 --> 00:04:35,930
time was when I got really turned on to

116
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:37,939
the medical movement in earnest became

117
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:40,250
aware of people like brownie Mary and

118
00:04:37,939 --> 00:04:42,650
Dennis Peron a little bit later but

119
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:44,870
earlier became aware of a clinic and

120
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:47,989
Santa Cruz called women advocates for

121
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:50,509
medical marijuana or Wham and this was

122
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:53,389
really a team that I believe Rick Doblin

123
00:04:50,509 --> 00:04:56,810
from Maps helped to connect Israeli

124
00:04:53,389 --> 00:04:58,788
researchers after the government was

125
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:01,370
shutting down their efforts but they

126
00:04:58,788 --> 00:05:04,310
were exclusively devoted to cancer and

127
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:07,189
AIDS patients and to providing medical

128
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:10,218
cannabis at that time in the day which

129
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:12,229
is sort of early 90s there was of course

130
00:05:10,218 --> 00:05:15,050
this really horrible fallout with the

131
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:16,728
AIDS crisis and watching sort of what

132
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:19,788
looked like scenes from The Walking Dead

133
00:05:16,728 --> 00:05:22,310
at point um in places like the

134
00:05:19,788 --> 00:05:24,168
Tenderloin in San Francisco on you would

135
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:26,149
see AIDS patients on the street with

136
00:05:24,168 --> 00:05:28,310
wasting syndrome really just

137
00:05:26,149 --> 00:05:30,948
experiencing unbelievably low quality of

138
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:32,689
life and then in their community you

139
00:05:30,949 --> 00:05:34,908
would see kind of a completely different

140
00:05:32,689 --> 00:05:37,939
story happening where people's quality

141
00:05:34,908 --> 00:05:39,978
of life was really clearly improved by

142
00:05:37,939 --> 00:05:42,889
their reliance on cannabis and having

143
00:05:39,978 --> 00:05:44,508
administered in a consistent way so that

144
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:46,550
was really where the lightbulb was going

145
00:05:44,509 --> 00:05:49,069
off and then eventually being exposed to

146
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:52,819
like Dennis perón's compassionate buyers

147
00:05:49,069 --> 00:05:55,610
club and just that whole movement um so

148
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:58,009
as I became aware that the properties in

149
00:05:55,610 --> 00:06:00,408
cannabis that helped me to deal with

150
00:05:58,009 --> 00:06:02,960
pretty high levels of anxiety when I was

151
00:06:00,408 --> 00:06:05,629
young and felt like a far more creative

152
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:08,028
and productive alternative to alcohol

153
00:06:05,629 --> 00:06:10,550
consumption and being in Sonoma County

154
00:06:08,028 --> 00:06:13,788
which is also the wine country and I was

155
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:16,009
surrounded by heavy alcoholism and some

156
00:06:13,788 --> 00:06:17,870
of that in my family as well and so

157
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:20,300
cannabis just felt like a healthful and

158
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:22,250
exciting alternative but little did I

159
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:24,158
know it would become you know really a

160
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:26,718
life's work and something that

161
00:06:24,158 --> 00:06:28,668
increasingly fuel can really improve the

162
00:06:26,718 --> 00:06:30,079
quality of life for a huge array of

163
00:06:28,668 --> 00:06:33,079
people around the world as we're all

164
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:35,838
working on this endeavor but I'm anyways

165
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:36,639
I moved from the Bay Area up to Portland

166
00:06:35,838 --> 00:06:39,459
in

167
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:42,310
thousand so Portland Oregon is where

168
00:06:39,459 --> 00:06:43,748
them ever sent and I got involved

169
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:47,019
immediately with the medical marijuana

170
00:06:43,749 --> 00:06:49,150
program here and I'd already had you

171
00:06:47,019 --> 00:06:51,068
know a lot of years experience almost 15

172
00:06:49,149 --> 00:06:53,948
years experience in the bay before

173
00:06:51,069 --> 00:06:56,800
coming up but then really became

174
00:06:53,949 --> 00:06:59,228
involved with a lot of patients and in

175
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,110
the work with patients over time I got

176
00:06:59,228 --> 00:07:04,120
better at sort of gathering cultivars

177
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:07,419
from around the world and really I'm

178
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,968
finding different sorts of medicine and

179
00:07:07,418 --> 00:07:11,468
being able to administer that

180
00:07:08,968 --> 00:07:13,718
effectively through my gardens and a

181
00:07:11,468 --> 00:07:16,389
small network was really the foundation

182
00:07:13,718 --> 00:07:19,509
of my work in Oregon over time I found

183
00:07:16,389 --> 00:07:22,120
some incredible patients who had benefit

184
00:07:19,509 --> 00:07:23,590
and experienced pretty good outcomes by

185
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:27,218
being able to work with them and

186
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:29,468
ultimately I found their support was

187
00:07:27,218 --> 00:07:33,158
able to help me eventually become

188
00:07:29,468 --> 00:07:35,079
involved in the dispensary program when

189
00:07:33,158 --> 00:07:37,810
we became aware of the fact that there

190
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:38,498
was going to be a dispensary program in

191
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:40,838
Oregon

192
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:43,300
it was clear that actually I didn't have

193
00:07:40,838 --> 00:07:45,668
the resources or ability to kind of

194
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:48,038
pursue that sort of opportunity without

195
00:07:45,668 --> 00:07:50,490
partners but one patient in particular

196
00:07:48,038 --> 00:07:53,620
this amazing man named Steve Bennett

197
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:57,699
really just got behind my work and let

198
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:59,588
me use a lot of resources um really to

199
00:07:57,699 --> 00:08:03,218
be able to categorize chemo VARs

200
00:07:59,588 --> 00:08:05,379
effectively at the time when I was

201
00:08:03,218 --> 00:08:07,778
actually a pre dispensary program in

202
00:08:05,379 --> 00:08:10,180
Oregon as a medical grower there were

203
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:13,180
very few people pursuing chemical

204
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:15,699
inventory of their product and I knew

205
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:17,918
that there was clearly a wide spread of

206
00:08:15,699 --> 00:08:20,139
different outcomes in the work I've been

207
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:22,478
doing the patients and was desperate to

208
00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:25,060
kind of categorize the qualitative

209
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:27,370
attributes of these plants I was very

210
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:29,649
fortunate that a good friend rich chrome

211
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:32,288
one who goes by one eye and this breeder

212
00:08:29,649 --> 00:08:35,379
up here he's associated with dog-walker

213
00:08:32,288 --> 00:08:38,139
strain and others I'm introduced me to a

214
00:08:35,379 --> 00:08:39,519
man named Pat Marshall that Marshall was

215
00:08:38,139 --> 00:08:42,549
the leading chemist at sunrise

216
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:45,068
analytical looking back I now believe

217
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:46,990
that Pat Marshall was likely one of the

218
00:08:45,068 --> 00:08:49,328
most important cannabis chemists in the

219
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:50,379
country because he'd been going since

220
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:53,829
the mid 90s

221
00:08:50,379 --> 00:08:56,950
and he was a really senior scientist who

222
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:59,680
had been the top scientist and city of

223
00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:01,210
Portland's water quality control and so

224
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:05,199
he was a master of gas chromatography

225
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:06,960
and he was a patient activist so he was

226
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,550
really turned on to the idea that

227
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:11,710
cannabis was helping people and so he

228
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:15,279
worked to kind of crack the matrix I'm

229
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:17,800
in a sort of solo effort looking very

230
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:20,529
little outside of his own work and in a

231
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:22,809
disciplined way pursued sort of mapping

232
00:09:20,529 --> 00:09:25,959
all of this and then would be able to

233
00:09:22,809 --> 00:09:28,779
produce analytical results that had 64

234
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:31,480
compounds so seeing this level of

235
00:09:28,779 --> 00:09:33,370
chemical diversity i'm produced by a

236
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:36,220
really rigorous scientist in a

237
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:39,789
consistent fashion was a huge

238
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:42,040
transformation in my work and my partner

239
00:09:39,789 --> 00:09:45,339
Steeve really helped me - in addition to

240
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:47,500
inventory all of my own cultivars even

241
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:49,930
we paid for lab results for other

242
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:52,509
people's cultivars to start to kind of

243
00:09:49,929 --> 00:09:55,839
wet I am going to borrow some language

244
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:57,879
from a friend dr. mark Lewis I'm I was

245
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:00,700
unintentionally beginning a survey of

246
00:09:57,879 --> 00:10:02,789
the chemo scape in Oregon and trying to

247
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:06,190
find what were the most useful

248
00:10:02,789 --> 00:10:07,860
properties and in a sense how did those

249
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:10,420
combine with my production environment

250
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:11,980
one of the shocking discoveries that

251
00:10:10,419 --> 00:10:14,289
happen first when I started getting all

252
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:17,409
these lab results with it essentially

253
00:10:14,289 --> 00:10:20,139
when I gave four skillful producers the

254
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:22,059
exact same genotype or the exact same

255
00:10:20,139 --> 00:10:25,029
cutting taken from a mother plant that I

256
00:10:22,059 --> 00:10:27,099
provided after the course of growing

257
00:10:25,029 --> 00:10:29,669
them out and going to past lab and

258
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:32,830
testing them thoroughly and even

259
00:10:29,669 --> 00:10:36,159
retesting them we were able to validate

260
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:38,680
that there was a huge range of chemical

261
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:42,639
diversity from the exact same plant so

262
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:44,829
in one sample there was like 28 28 point

263
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:47,519
something milligrams per gram of beta

264
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:50,259
mere seen in another there was - and

265
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:52,600
those two plants were clearly going to

266
00:10:50,259 --> 00:10:55,269
have very different outcomes for

267
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:57,970
patients and have different therapeutic

268
00:10:55,269 --> 00:10:59,439
properties so then I really keyed into

269
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:02,259
the fact that the production environment

270
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,760
was a huge variable that the phenotypic

271
00:11:02,259 --> 00:11:06,278
diversity of cannabis

272
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:09,549
for the interaction between genes and

273
00:11:06,278 --> 00:11:12,399
the environment as a producer was really

274
00:11:09,549 --> 00:11:14,439
as important to me as the actual

275
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,860
genotype or the genetic material of the

276
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:19,240
plant

277
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:21,278
so I began creating quadrants I had at

278
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:23,829
the time three different Medical Gardens

279
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:25,990
I was associated with and would divide

280
00:11:23,828 --> 00:11:28,059
them into quadrants where I would be

281
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:30,549
trialing different sort of media

282
00:11:28,059 --> 00:11:33,338
different lighting solutions different

283
00:11:30,549 --> 00:11:35,769
environmental conditions and producing

284
00:11:33,339 --> 00:11:37,930
analytical results additionally I've

285
00:11:35,769 --> 00:11:40,870
always been involved with hybridization

286
00:11:37,929 --> 00:11:42,759
and I say that I you know it was

287
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:46,000
specifically not intentional plant

288
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:48,519
breeding I did not have known traits

289
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,879
that I was trying to kind of advance in

290
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:53,620
the early days but had them on a team of

291
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:55,629
friends that had produced cultivars that

292
00:11:53,620 --> 00:12:00,039
were pretty famous and Portland in the

293
00:11:55,629 --> 00:12:01,750
early 2000s but really um I was able to

294
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:03,730
start to kind of look at all of this

295
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:05,230
genetic diversity and see that in

296
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:07,269
addition to the variables of the

297
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:09,519
environment that the genes really

298
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:12,278
mattered as well and that both of those

299
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:14,139
have become you know this long-term

300
00:12:12,278 --> 00:12:16,389
exploration that I'm just really

301
00:12:14,139 --> 00:12:19,448
grateful to have had with the resources

302
00:12:16,389 --> 00:12:21,549
and time and partners to be able to work

303
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:23,979
with all in the hopes of eventually

304
00:12:21,549 --> 00:12:26,559
being able to have a spectrum of

305
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:29,139
products that really are targeted to

306
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:30,578
particular patient outcomes of course

307
00:12:29,139 --> 00:12:33,399
many people are talking in those terms

308
00:12:30,578 --> 00:12:36,609
now but I had about eight years of data

309
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:38,559
prior to the advent of like analytical

310
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:40,568
testing as a result of compliance

311
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:43,208
testing in the regulated cannabis

312
00:12:40,568 --> 00:12:45,458
industry and had worked with so many

313
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:47,500
diverse environments that it really was

314
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:50,409
a lot of insight about what these

315
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:52,690
environments and the role but things

316
00:12:50,409 --> 00:12:55,480
like what kind of we're using mineral

317
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:57,730
salt fertilizers or we're using you know

318
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:59,319
living organic soil eventually we're

319
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:02,440
using a variety of different organic

320
00:12:59,318 --> 00:13:05,439
inputs rerunning you know high VPD or

321
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:06,940
low VPD strategies you have high

322
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,220
pressure sodium Zoar in the old days

323
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:11,890
where you flowering under metal halides

324
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:14,709
and looking at all these variables I

325
00:13:11,889 --> 00:13:16,929
sort of had low level observational

326
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:17,589
study data that was able to help me to

327
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:20,679
start to key

328
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:22,180
into trends where I could optimize the

329
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:25,000
expression of cannabinoids and

330
00:13:22,179 --> 00:13:27,669
terpenoids I'm what was really exciting

331
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,649
was over the course of time using this

332
00:13:27,669 --> 00:13:33,129
kind of feedback I was able as a

333
00:13:29,649 --> 00:13:35,079
producer to really become much more

334
00:13:33,129 --> 00:13:38,590
sophisticated than Arneson high levels

335
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:40,509
so I know that I there was a group of us

336
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:42,970
that were growing a dog walker for

337
00:13:40,509 --> 00:13:45,549
example and I think only about five of

338
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:47,170
us had that plant for many years and it

339
00:13:45,549 --> 00:13:48,579
was easily one of the most important

340
00:13:47,169 --> 00:13:50,949
therapeutic plants that we were working

341
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:54,009
with especially for oncology patients

342
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:55,660
people with chronic pain and people who

343
00:13:54,009 --> 00:13:57,309
needed really strong effect and we're

344
00:13:55,659 --> 00:14:00,429
looking for kind of relaxing calming

345
00:13:57,309 --> 00:14:01,809
effects that I noticed that as I was

346
00:14:00,429 --> 00:14:04,149
sort of competing with the other

347
00:14:01,809 --> 00:14:06,429
producers who are our friends I mean I

348
00:14:04,149 --> 00:14:09,189
definitely was hitting extreme levels

349
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:11,739
and was able to produce because the most

350
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:15,040
terpenes I've ever seen in a lab results

351
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:16,899
and that was all through the course of

352
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:19,179
kind of getting insights in the

353
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:20,379
observational studies and optimizing the

354
00:14:19,179 --> 00:14:23,529
production environment

355
00:14:20,379 --> 00:14:26,200
of course in those variables you

356
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:28,720
mentioned photo X one of the things that

357
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:30,810
stood out after nutrition environment

358
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,430
that was probably the most singular

359
00:14:30,809 --> 00:14:35,829
important variable was lighting and the

360
00:14:33,429 --> 00:14:37,179
quality of lighting so one one of the

361
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:40,030
things that I was able to start to

362
00:14:37,179 --> 00:14:42,489
experiment with was using the very first

363
00:14:40,029 --> 00:14:46,539
generation of LEDs that were available

364
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:48,759
with custom spectrums and I ordered

365
00:14:46,539 --> 00:14:51,909
these bars that would have like Deep

366
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:54,100
Purple's and violet lights and I

367
00:14:51,909 --> 00:14:56,139
witnessed a complete transformation in

368
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:58,659
the morphology as I used different

369
00:14:56,139 --> 00:15:01,179
lighting spectra and lighting intensity

370
00:14:58,659 --> 00:15:03,459
and so the evolution of lighting I've

371
00:15:01,179 --> 00:15:06,000
really written all the way from like

372
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:09,100
there was literally mercury vapor bulbs

373
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,250
and you know that turned into metal

374
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:16,480
halides and fluorescent lights and then

375
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:18,789
later single-ended HPS lights and then

376
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,590
double-ended that one thing i notice is

377
00:15:18,789 --> 00:15:23,610
when the lights shifted from

378
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:26,440
single-ended HPS to double-ended hvs

379
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:29,529
suddenly there was an explosion and kind

380
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:30,529
of more resinous cannabis and higher

381
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:33,259
potency

382
00:15:30,528 --> 00:15:35,088
this so it was very clear that the

383
00:15:33,259 --> 00:15:37,459
lighting was you know a giant

384
00:15:35,089 --> 00:15:40,009
differentiating factor and producers who

385
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:43,128
didn't have access to the HVAC equipment

386
00:15:40,009 --> 00:15:47,058
were the ceiling height or the various

387
00:15:43,129 --> 00:15:49,399
things that required double-ended HPS to

388
00:15:47,058 --> 00:15:51,049
perform well simply had a competitive

389
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:54,049
advantage that was massive

390
00:15:51,049 --> 00:15:55,519
um I feel that same kind of scheme is

391
00:15:54,049 --> 00:15:57,198
happening with LEDs and I'm sure we'll

392
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,808
talk about this a little bit later but

393
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:02,688
that ultimately LEDs have provided a

394
00:15:59,808 --> 00:16:05,600
massive competitive advantage for those

395
00:16:02,688 --> 00:16:08,659
who can understand how to unlock the

396
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:11,629
power of using targeted wavelength and

397
00:16:08,659 --> 00:16:13,909
much more intense lighting and much more

398
00:16:11,629 --> 00:16:15,920
consistent lighting and dimmable

399
00:16:13,909 --> 00:16:18,249
lighting as well as directional lighting

400
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:21,860
I mean it's just full of advantages but

401
00:16:18,249 --> 00:16:24,920
in any case all of this put in into

402
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:26,360
motion allows for me to create a range

403
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:29,120
of products that I felt

404
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,980
stood out and were really special and I

405
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,558
was getting that feedback from patients

406
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:36,438
that I was working with that was the

407
00:16:33,558 --> 00:16:38,870
genesis of the ideas behind the

408
00:16:36,438 --> 00:16:42,588
dispensary I co-founded with my partner

409
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:45,019
Shem a wood called Pharma Pharma is a

410
00:16:42,589 --> 00:16:48,050
dispensary in Portland spelled with an F

411
00:16:45,019 --> 00:16:50,240
and the idea was you know we're really

412
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:52,578
excited about whole plant cannabis

413
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:55,159
therapeutic products we want to be

414
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:57,649
sophisticated and representing and

415
00:16:55,159 --> 00:17:00,919
curating those products and really took

416
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:03,139
almost all of my servant ition for how

417
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:06,168
that product mix should be curated I'm

418
00:17:03,139 --> 00:17:09,109
based on the early research of dr. Ethan

419
00:17:06,169 --> 00:17:12,259
Russo I've also traveled to Israel and

420
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:14,509
met chemists like Lumiere and spent time

421
00:17:12,259 --> 00:17:16,519
with Professor ma shulam and a variety

422
00:17:14,509 --> 00:17:19,640
of other people but it was really Ethan

423
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:22,038
Rousseau who I think gave me the tools

424
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:25,009
to understand that in that first paper

425
00:17:22,038 --> 00:17:27,769
the taming THC paper I'd read there was

426
00:17:25,009 --> 00:17:29,779
15 compounds people at that and was

427
00:17:27,769 --> 00:17:32,538
giving them a particular value and that

428
00:17:29,779 --> 00:17:35,538
we wanted to be able to curate from that

429
00:17:32,538 --> 00:17:37,359
perspective as opposed to kind of

430
00:17:35,538 --> 00:17:40,700
pseudoscience indica and sativa

431
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:42,558
perspective or a lot of the other

432
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,740
language and misnomers that came along

433
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:48,178
with a probe

434
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:50,490
era and cannabis culture so we for

435
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:52,440
example tested everything at the

436
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:54,808
dispensary through one lab through

437
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:57,899
summarize analytical I actually produced

438
00:17:54,808 --> 00:17:59,788
that all 24 cultivars that we had for

439
00:17:57,898 --> 00:18:01,939
roughly the first year and a half and

440
00:17:59,788 --> 00:18:04,769
while we were still a medical dispensary

441
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:07,860
but I was unable to continue to keep up

442
00:18:04,769 --> 00:18:10,500
once we became a adult use dispensary

443
00:18:07,859 --> 00:18:12,839
so we then had to bring in a lot of

444
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:14,159
different producers but during that

445
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:16,470
first year and a half it felt like

446
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:18,750
something magical happened where we were

447
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:22,319
the only dispensary in the world at the

448
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:25,769
time to post terpene data and to both

449
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:28,798
feature overall turkeying output as well

450
00:18:25,769 --> 00:18:30,808
as specific terpene content and i came

451
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:34,619
up with an algorithm that essentially

452
00:18:30,808 --> 00:18:36,538
was able to sort out what all consumers

453
00:18:34,619 --> 00:18:39,148
were coming in with which was this

454
00:18:36,538 --> 00:18:41,190
notion of indica and sativa and being

455
00:18:39,148 --> 00:18:43,769
able to sort of put on a spectrum with

456
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:46,350
six point relaxing and calming effects

457
00:18:43,769 --> 00:18:48,778
on one side focusing and reforms effects

458
00:18:46,349 --> 00:18:52,019
on the other with a meat week medium and

459
00:18:48,778 --> 00:18:55,440
strong gradation for each of course this

460
00:18:52,019 --> 00:18:58,139
is as much art as science because the

461
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,179
science of looking at the ensemble or

462
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:03,028
entourage effect at the time and even

463
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:05,909
now is of course far behind where we

464
00:19:03,028 --> 00:19:07,769
ideally want it to be we can talk in

465
00:19:05,909 --> 00:19:09,929
some depth especially with new

466
00:19:07,769 --> 00:19:13,349
publications by dr. Russo and others

467
00:19:09,929 --> 00:19:15,798
about the individual components and some

468
00:19:13,349 --> 00:19:17,569
of the drug interactions that the

469
00:19:15,798 --> 00:19:21,509
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic

470
00:19:17,569 --> 00:19:24,148
insights that are still elusive that we

471
00:19:21,509 --> 00:19:25,950
need to understand the really

472
00:19:24,148 --> 00:19:28,918
complicated effects with these whole

473
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:31,798
plants um is simply not mature yet but

474
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:34,320
it felt important to sort of draw a line

475
00:19:31,798 --> 00:19:36,569
in the sand and say um the Prohibition

476
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:40,048
era is coming to an end and it's time to

477
00:19:36,569 --> 00:19:42,658
really honor and respect this plants in

478
00:19:40,048 --> 00:19:45,028
the way that we can sort of like share

479
00:19:42,659 --> 00:19:46,830
the diversity and nuance of traits and

480
00:19:45,028 --> 00:19:49,319
without making it a comparison to

481
00:19:46,829 --> 00:19:52,019
alcohol look a bit like other craft

482
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:54,990
industries and and be able to sort of

483
00:19:52,019 --> 00:19:57,069
make it more useful to patients but

484
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:58,839
further we insisted that

485
00:19:57,069 --> 00:20:00,189
everybody we worked with and I was

486
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:02,888
really at the lead of this in the

487
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:04,659
beginning I became highly trained and

488
00:20:02,888 --> 00:20:07,658
professional and representing a

489
00:20:04,659 --> 00:20:09,970
science-based vision of how to apply

490
00:20:07,659 --> 00:20:13,210
cannabis therapeutics and work with

491
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:15,630
products like RSO and especially with

492
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:18,759
people who were you know late stage

493
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:21,720
oncology or end-of-life care or seizure

494
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:24,159
disorders or some of the most important

495
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:27,278
kinds of patients we were serving and I

496
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:29,649
think it was just a miracle that I met

497
00:20:27,278 --> 00:20:33,009
Sam Haywood who had the unbelievable

498
00:20:29,648 --> 00:20:34,928
business acumen and marketing ideas and

499
00:20:33,009 --> 00:20:37,538
strategies to be able to kind of help

500
00:20:34,929 --> 00:20:39,610
Pharma to bloom in this way that became

501
00:20:37,538 --> 00:20:42,099
a really unique resource and we really

502
00:20:39,609 --> 00:20:44,408
attracted a lot of attention at national

503
00:20:42,099 --> 00:20:47,648
and international media had just a lot

504
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:49,600
of support for this model and we worked

505
00:20:47,648 --> 00:20:53,048
our faces off I literally was working

506
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:55,058
seven days a week I would often do more

507
00:20:53,048 --> 00:20:57,700
than 12 hours a day there were many

508
00:20:55,058 --> 00:21:00,388
16-hour days back-to-back I would be on

509
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:03,009
my feet the whole time and the

510
00:21:00,388 --> 00:21:05,678
eventually that sort of led to kind of

511
00:21:03,009 --> 00:21:07,450
burnout around trying to operate Gardens

512
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:10,620
and work with patients and operate the

513
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:13,450
dispensary and being a tiny team and so

514
00:21:10,619 --> 00:21:15,819
Sam really with the rest of the Pharma

515
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:18,250
team have continued operations with

516
00:21:15,819 --> 00:21:20,558
Pharma well I took some reflective time

517
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:23,378
and worked to establish a garden that

518
00:21:20,558 --> 00:21:26,138
would be a bigger scale garden and of

519
00:21:23,378 --> 00:21:27,849
course you know that I love your podcast

520
00:21:26,138 --> 00:21:29,229
and I'm so grateful to be on because one

521
00:21:27,849 --> 00:21:31,750
of the things that you have done is

522
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:34,298
helped to really emphasize and underline

523
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:36,490
the importance of ecological production

524
00:21:34,298 --> 00:21:38,558
and sophisticated perspectives from

525
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:40,808
organic crop production and that's

526
00:21:38,558 --> 00:21:43,450
something that's really really near and

527
00:21:40,808 --> 00:21:45,548
dear to my heart I feel that if at scale

528
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:47,950
this whole industry employed the kinds

529
00:21:45,548 --> 00:21:49,778
of practices that you espouse from many

530
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:52,058
people on your show have brought forward

531
00:21:49,778 --> 00:21:55,980
you know ultimately we'd take a bite out

532
00:21:52,058 --> 00:21:58,089
of climate change we'd take all kinds of

533
00:21:55,980 --> 00:22:01,028
sequestering of atmospheric carbon

534
00:21:58,089 --> 00:22:03,158
practices into motion with even further

535
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:06,128
influence agriculture and horticulture

536
00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:09,519
on the whole and you know there's just

537
00:22:06,128 --> 00:22:11,019
so many wonderful aspects to this notion

538
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:12,339
that regenerative farm

539
00:22:11,019 --> 00:22:14,859
it's really going to make a huge

540
00:22:12,339 --> 00:22:16,750
contribution to the quality of life on

541
00:22:14,859 --> 00:22:19,149
the planet and I'm really behind that I

542
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:21,759
also know there there's another priority

543
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:24,370
that has probably even become more

544
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:26,289
important for my personal work as I've

545
00:22:24,369 --> 00:22:28,959
gone down this path I really want to be

546
00:22:26,289 --> 00:22:32,019
able to create targeted consistent chemo

547
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:34,900
chemical varieties that are reliable for

548
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:37,210
patients and that illustrate a path

549
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:40,179
towards being able to have a long-term

550
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:43,029
relationship with whole plant derived by

551
00:22:40,179 --> 00:22:45,580
the chemistry and not simply you know

552
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:48,369
leave the sort of really serious

553
00:22:45,579 --> 00:22:50,889
patients in the hands of pharmaceutical

554
00:22:48,369 --> 00:22:53,859
companies that are developing you know

555
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:56,920
through clinical trial work maybe sort

556
00:22:53,859 --> 00:22:59,709
of single varieties of cannabis

557
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:02,019
chemistry and trying to provide even

558
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:04,808
from a synthetic cannabinoid perspective

559
00:23:02,019 --> 00:23:06,910
you know totally consistent compounds

560
00:23:04,808 --> 00:23:09,789
but that are not being produced from a

561
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:12,490
plant or are being greatly refined after

562
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:14,920
being reproduced from a plat because I

563
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:18,069
have always had and even more so now

564
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:21,039
than ever have a just unshakable belief

565
00:23:18,069 --> 00:23:24,279
that there is wisdom in a plant that is

566
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:25,808
sort of more than we can quantify with

567
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:27,519
an analytical testing result and

568
00:23:25,808 --> 00:23:30,069
certainly at the resolution of

569
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:34,079
analytical testing we're at now and

570
00:23:30,069 --> 00:23:37,659
there is also a folk medicine revolution

571
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:40,178
aspect to relying on whole plants which

572
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:42,670
means that really we're in a situation

573
00:23:40,179 --> 00:23:45,160
where people internationally can grow

574
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:47,800
plants and take care of their well-being

575
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:50,050
and take care of their family and loved

576
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:52,899
ones and communities well being with

577
00:23:50,049 --> 00:23:55,808
plants and not be entirely reliant on

578
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:58,269
pharmaceutical companies to be able to

579
00:23:55,808 --> 00:24:01,960
provide that relief but that we have to

580
00:23:58,269 --> 00:24:04,058
become very mature quickly to be able to

581
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:07,120
command some part of the market share

582
00:24:04,058 --> 00:24:09,940
and to inspire and illustrate a path

583
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:12,009
forward where people can continue to

584
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:13,779
relate with this ancient plant in a

585
00:24:12,009 --> 00:24:16,210
really meaningful way and in modern

586
00:24:13,779 --> 00:24:18,428
times find the kinds of health benefits

587
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:21,549
they would expect to find from even

588
00:24:18,429 --> 00:24:24,609
pharmaceutical drugs but without having

589
00:24:21,549 --> 00:24:28,138
to go through that an entire part of

590
00:24:24,608 --> 00:24:30,608
yeah I guess that part of the economy so

591
00:24:28,138 --> 00:24:33,339
that said I I've become increasingly

592
00:24:30,608 --> 00:24:35,769
focused on targeted chemo bars so I was

593
00:24:33,339 --> 00:24:37,628
trying to build a farm it was going to

594
00:24:35,769 --> 00:24:40,569
be called nucleus nurseries it

595
00:24:37,628 --> 00:24:44,038
essentially balanced the ecological crop

596
00:24:40,569 --> 00:24:48,939
production methods with targeted chemo

597
00:24:44,038 --> 00:24:51,278
chemical varieties so not actually after

598
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:54,788
raising a lot of money quite a lot of my

599
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:56,888
a big team and being a CEO and a year

600
00:24:54,788 --> 00:24:59,440
and a half of development that effort

601
00:24:56,888 --> 00:25:02,439
was going to fruit and the campus called

602
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:05,528
the Oh hub which is the Oregon science

603
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:09,399
and research campus that Philo's

604
00:25:05,528 --> 00:25:10,929
bioscience Cascadia analytics and a few

605
00:25:09,398 --> 00:25:13,199
other partners we're going to have on

606
00:25:10,929 --> 00:25:15,190
some land south of town but

607
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:18,159
unfortunately we're actually in

608
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:20,619
hindsight very fortunately shortly

609
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:22,869
before Trump got elected when it was

610
00:25:20,618 --> 00:25:26,138
clear that things were starting to go

611
00:25:22,868 --> 00:25:29,108
away from an Obama era into an era that

612
00:25:26,138 --> 00:25:32,528
looked less supportive of the cannabis

613
00:25:29,108 --> 00:25:34,749
economy to flourish um I sort of had to

614
00:25:32,528 --> 00:25:37,868
deal with dissolving a company because

615
00:25:34,749 --> 00:25:40,358
the landlords and the investors started

616
00:25:37,868 --> 00:25:42,308
getting cold feet and things got shaky

617
00:25:40,358 --> 00:25:44,378
and and so really for about eight to

618
00:25:42,308 --> 00:25:47,408
nine months I ended up having to

619
00:25:44,378 --> 00:25:49,269
dissolve nucleus nurseries and this was

620
00:25:47,409 --> 00:25:51,460
a really hard time for me because I'd

621
00:25:49,269 --> 00:25:53,618
worked with people from around the world

622
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:56,409
to create what I felt would be the most

623
00:25:53,618 --> 00:25:58,148
ecological production environment that

624
00:25:56,409 --> 00:26:01,210
had ever happened we were talking about

625
00:25:58,148 --> 00:26:05,168
like 12 acres of solar panels to run all

626
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:07,989
led on super high-tech glass house that

627
00:26:05,169 --> 00:26:10,929
was based on Dutch green house design

628
00:26:07,989 --> 00:26:14,460
that was had a variety of considerations

629
00:26:10,929 --> 00:26:17,200
epic scale rainwater catchment and

630
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:19,629
regenerative living soil program and a

631
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,489
sort of food forest in polyculture

632
00:26:19,628 --> 00:26:22,959
landscape that was featured in anyway

633
00:26:21,489 --> 00:26:24,940
servers this whole vision that was very

634
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,759
compelling I had completely bought in

635
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:30,940
but after it had to be dissolved

636
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:32,460
actually that was the best thing that

637
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:35,080
ever could have happened to me because

638
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:37,778
that effort wouldn't have been able to

639
00:26:35,079 --> 00:26:39,908
survive in the Oregon market as

640
00:26:37,778 --> 00:26:42,999
market has shaken out with massive

641
00:26:39,909 --> 00:26:45,249
overproduction and really as a producer

642
00:26:42,999 --> 00:26:49,089
your survival depends on being able to

643
00:26:45,249 --> 00:26:50,798
access shelf space and retail so I

644
00:26:49,089 --> 00:26:53,439
became a consultant for a period of time

645
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:55,528
and my partner Sam and I founded a

646
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:58,690
company called agonist consulting

647
00:26:55,528 --> 00:27:01,778
agonist then engaged with the now

648
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:05,798
Governor New Jersey Phil Murphy and I

649
00:27:01,778 --> 00:27:07,868
became involved in emerging regulatory

650
00:27:05,798 --> 00:27:09,759
markets after having had paid dues

651
00:27:07,868 --> 00:27:12,759
already in the organ market which I

652
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:15,298
didn't mention I was on the OLC see just

653
00:27:12,759 --> 00:27:18,489
the Oregon Liquor &amp; Control Commission

654
00:27:15,298 --> 00:27:20,710
rulemaking Advisory Committee I worked

655
00:27:18,489 --> 00:27:23,558
with the governor worked with the mayor

656
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:26,469
I worked with members of Congress I

657
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:30,628
worked with congressman role bloomin our

658
00:27:26,469 --> 00:27:34,320
and actually co-founded the very first

659
00:27:30,628 --> 00:27:36,668
regenerative cannabis event with

660
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:38,618
congressman Earl bloomin our and in

661
00:27:36,669 --> 00:27:41,440
partnership with the Willamette week

662
00:27:38,618 --> 00:27:43,808
started an event that was really meant

663
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,820
to support sort of the kinds of insights

664
00:27:43,808 --> 00:27:48,368
that are what you're curating on your

665
00:27:45,819 --> 00:27:50,200
show and that's actually become the

666
00:27:48,368 --> 00:27:52,838
largest craft cannabis event in Oregon

667
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:55,058
and is really doing some exciting things

668
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:58,719
I'd like to talk more about but I'll

669
00:27:55,058 --> 00:28:01,509
save that for another subject they I had

670
00:27:58,719 --> 00:28:03,460
a lot of experience with sort of working

671
00:28:01,509 --> 00:28:06,519
to try to find a way to bring the best

672
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:08,319
ethics and practices forward for this

673
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:11,048
emerging industry that I cared so much

674
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:13,479
about and to also try to protect the

675
00:28:11,048 --> 00:28:16,058
craft producers and the people who were

676
00:28:13,479 --> 00:28:17,619
clearly in a position that looked like

677
00:28:16,058 --> 00:28:19,898
they were going to be left behind

678
00:28:17,618 --> 00:28:21,189
and so there was a lot of battles and

679
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:24,308
some of that got played out in the

680
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:27,249
consultancy but then I landed a client

681
00:28:24,308 --> 00:28:30,038
that is called groundworks industries it

682
00:28:27,249 --> 00:28:32,319
owns proof cultivar and this was the

683
00:28:30,038 --> 00:28:35,288
most fateful moment in my story because

684
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:36,939
really proof cultivar is a very

685
00:28:35,288 --> 00:28:40,298
high-tech facility in Northeast Portland

686
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:42,820
it's all controlled environment I'm sort

687
00:28:40,298 --> 00:28:45,999
of precision AG modeled on environments

688
00:28:42,819 --> 00:28:49,058
it has 16 different chambers that are

689
00:28:45,999 --> 00:28:51,500
tightly controlled and it allows for my

690
00:28:49,058 --> 00:28:53,869
original work back to testing

691
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:55,670
in environmental strategies and huge

692
00:28:53,869 --> 00:28:58,129
amounts of genetic diversity and working

693
00:28:55,670 --> 00:29:01,310
with hybridization to really do this

694
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:03,230
work at scale in a mature way and it's

695
00:29:01,309 --> 00:29:05,359
really just being a dream come true

696
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:08,120
where rather than having to manage

697
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:09,919
investor expectations now there's people

698
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:12,649
who are really sophisticated at that

699
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:14,360
that they can deal with that task and

700
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:16,430
rather than having to do all these other

701
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:17,089
things that I had to do as a CEO for

702
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:19,400
nucleus

703
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:21,500
I found a team that was really strong

704
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:23,540
and able to support me to do what I most

705
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:26,329
wanted to do which was to go back to

706
00:29:23,539 --> 00:29:28,940
solve the problem I saw at Pharma which

707
00:29:26,329 --> 00:29:32,299
was there is a huge amount of product

708
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:33,890
consistency issues in the market the

709
00:29:32,299 --> 00:29:36,019
product variability that I worked with

710
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:38,210
at the time would mean that if I was

711
00:29:36,019 --> 00:29:40,569
working with a patient and they found

712
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:42,980
just some miraculous curative

713
00:29:40,569 --> 00:29:45,799
relationship with a very particular team

714
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:49,250
of our and really whether they were

715
00:29:45,799 --> 00:29:52,329
using flour or concentrate if they were

716
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:54,559
to come back a month later it was almost

717
00:29:52,329 --> 00:29:56,990
inconceivable that even if we had the

718
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:59,299
exact same team of our or rather the

719
00:29:56,990 --> 00:30:02,420
same flour it was going to feature the

720
00:29:59,299 --> 00:30:05,480
same chemistry um we just saw huge

721
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:07,430
continuing diversity in the expression

722
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:09,799
of cannabis and I really wanted to be

723
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:11,390
able to provision patients with

724
00:30:09,799 --> 00:30:14,089
something that was more consistent and

725
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:16,880
closer to being a research grade because

726
00:30:14,089 --> 00:30:19,009
to me this is the critical line in the

727
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:21,080
sand we have to cross to enter into a

728
00:30:19,009 --> 00:30:24,170
more mature relationship with the

729
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:26,299
patients that we seek to serve it's to

730
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:28,730
be able to consistently produce a

731
00:30:26,299 --> 00:30:32,329
diversity a phytochemistry that's

732
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:35,000
maximally useful and therapeutic and and

733
00:30:32,329 --> 00:30:37,519
life-changing so I've been working on

734
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:41,690
that project that proof it's almost been

735
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:43,879
two years now and I've finally produced

736
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:45,830
some really great results I mean it's

737
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:48,320
just amazing what we're doing in this

738
00:30:45,829 --> 00:30:50,720
facility where I counted as a team

739
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:53,240
called Innovation Lab and there are

740
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:55,160
three main focuses in my research and

741
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:57,410
effort at this point to make this

742
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:59,330
research great output and I think that

743
00:30:57,410 --> 00:31:01,790
producers everywhere would be wise to be

744
00:30:59,329 --> 00:31:03,949
thinking about these variables above

745
00:31:01,789 --> 00:31:06,769
many others but the first variable

746
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:09,380
is to be able to do a phenotype

747
00:31:06,769 --> 00:31:11,899
discovery at scale to be able to

748
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:15,169
audition a huge amount of genetic

749
00:31:11,898 --> 00:31:17,719
diversity knowing how diverse cannabis

750
00:31:15,169 --> 00:31:20,750
is as being the most out bred plant in

751
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:22,429
history I'm being able to accommodate

752
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:25,940
the unique needs of all these different

753
00:31:22,429 --> 00:31:28,070
plants but to just audition in lots of a

754
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:31,490
thousand all of these different seeds

755
00:31:28,069 --> 00:31:34,099
that ultimately we're looking at from

756
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:37,038
high level resolution genomic science

757
00:31:34,099 --> 00:31:40,339
like fifty thousand genotypes nips for

758
00:31:37,038 --> 00:31:42,558
every plant a machine learning platform

759
00:31:40,339 --> 00:31:45,048
called proof OS that I've designed with

760
00:31:42,558 --> 00:31:47,990
the team it's really mature data science

761
00:31:45,048 --> 00:31:50,179
team from big AG it helps me to create

762
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:53,240
an environmental control system that

763
00:31:50,179 --> 00:31:55,159
essentially has sensor arrays and every

764
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:57,769
environment and that's tracking all

765
00:31:55,159 --> 00:32:00,380
factors related to plant growth in a

766
00:31:57,769 --> 00:32:04,808
pretty dense sensor array that gives

767
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:08,120
really clear visibility to real-time

768
00:32:04,808 --> 00:32:10,609
environmental experience trending data

769
00:32:08,119 --> 00:32:12,859
and where the machine learning comes in

770
00:32:10,609 --> 00:32:15,439
is to correlate all the way between

771
00:32:12,859 --> 00:32:17,750
genotype to chemo type these

772
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:20,028
interactions between our cultural

773
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:24,079
practices and all of the environmental

774
00:32:20,028 --> 00:32:27,440
inputs so taking my early low throughput

775
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:29,720
chemical genotyping or low throughput

776
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:32,750
phenotyping into a more high throughput

777
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:34,159
phenotyping mode we spend one of the

778
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:36,528
most exciting things about being

779
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:38,480
approved but so the first discipline is

780
00:32:36,528 --> 00:32:41,179
really phenotype discovery and then that

781
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:43,880
builds the palette of traits

782
00:32:41,179 --> 00:32:46,250
we're working on in our breeding work

783
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:47,539
and we have a variety of partners that

784
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:49,970
we're working with that tylose

785
00:32:47,538 --> 00:32:52,940
bioscience is the most important one for

786
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:54,769
the phenotype discovery work and we're

787
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:56,330
participating in a breeders innovation

788
00:32:54,769 --> 00:32:58,429
network that they've helped to

789
00:32:56,329 --> 00:33:01,158
facilitate I think it's a really

790
00:32:58,429 --> 00:33:03,259
exciting collaborative approach with a

791
00:33:01,159 --> 00:33:05,870
lot of ethics to kind of build an

792
00:33:03,259 --> 00:33:08,230
unbelievable new plant stock and both

793
00:33:05,869 --> 00:33:11,898
from like agronomic perspectives and

794
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:15,440
chemo typic perspectives so the second

795
00:33:11,898 --> 00:33:16,819
discipline that is a core focus for the

796
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:20,419
Innovation Lab

797
00:33:16,819 --> 00:33:22,278
is actually called photo biology and you

798
00:33:20,419 --> 00:33:25,639
mentioned photo X so one neat little

799
00:33:22,278 --> 00:33:29,359
fact is that Nick clays who is a founder

800
00:33:25,638 --> 00:33:32,119
and CEO past CEO for fluence

801
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:34,729
bioengineering from Austin Texas was up

802
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:36,949
visiting me in Portland with his partner

803
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:39,679
Jerry and one night in front of my

804
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:41,330
driveway in a rental car you're doing

805
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:44,090
the same thing I often do and kind of

806
00:33:41,329 --> 00:33:45,859
rattling on about chemo types and the

807
00:33:44,089 --> 00:33:48,288
importance of Adam and how their

808
00:33:45,859 --> 00:33:50,599
technology was intrinsic and you able to

809
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:53,028
unlock that potential and Nick founded

810
00:33:50,599 --> 00:33:56,298
that night the photo X conference which

811
00:33:53,028 --> 00:33:59,179
has also had for years now and photo X

812
00:33:56,298 --> 00:34:01,210
became an invite-only really special

813
00:33:59,179 --> 00:34:03,440
conference where brilliant academic

814
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:06,679
resources could come into the cannabis

815
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:09,108
conversation because it was framed as a

816
00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:11,690
photo biology conference so we would

817
00:34:09,108 --> 00:34:15,289
actually have like people from very

818
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:17,510
high-level universities working on non

819
00:34:15,289 --> 00:34:19,639
cannabis research that was relevant to

820
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:22,069
cannabis things like looking at

821
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:24,139
carotenoids research which is a

822
00:34:22,068 --> 00:34:25,849
secondary metabolite that's important if

823
00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:28,818
you're concerned with nutrition and

824
00:34:25,849 --> 00:34:32,559
produce and how that relates to photo

825
00:34:28,818 --> 00:34:35,389
biology or the effect of light on life

826
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:38,529
really but specifically looking at

827
00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:41,358
wavelengths and the different functions

828
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:44,480
wavelengths of light are playing as well

829
00:34:41,358 --> 00:34:45,710
as the intensity of light and exploring

830
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:48,378
for the first time with these

831
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:51,648
cutting-edge fixtures that allow for us

832
00:34:48,378 --> 00:34:54,618
to really in a very precise way I'm use

833
00:34:51,648 --> 00:34:56,628
wavelengths strategically to optimize

834
00:34:54,619 --> 00:34:59,568
plant growth of course nASA has been

835
00:34:56,628 --> 00:35:02,420
doing some work on photovoltaics and I

836
00:34:59,568 --> 00:35:04,550
believe the late 60s early 70s for space

837
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:07,280
travel and there's been all sorts of

838
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:11,030
early assumptions like red and blue

839
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:12,890
light or own two wavelengths that are or

840
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:15,500
that are principally associated with

841
00:35:12,889 --> 00:35:17,629
photosynthesis um of course we've gone

842
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:20,000
to a much more complicated world now

843
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:22,579
where we understand that all spectra of

844
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,650
light interacts with both plant

845
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:28,460
morphology and phytochemistry production

846
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:30,470
in very interesting ways so at proof we

847
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:34,338
have two different chambers that are

848
00:35:30,469 --> 00:35:37,730
being used and a single factor variable

849
00:35:34,338 --> 00:35:40,789
research to illustrate currently we're

850
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:43,608
working on the impact of far red light

851
00:35:40,789 --> 00:35:46,159
being included in a broad spectrum

852
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:48,828
fixture versus more of a near red light

853
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:51,230
and I know that you were at photo X this

854
00:35:48,829 --> 00:35:53,329
year and we had the kind of godfather of

855
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:56,599
photo biology Bruce Bugbee from

856
00:35:53,329 --> 00:35:58,369
University of Salt Lake there and he was

857
00:35:56,599 --> 00:36:01,369
presenting his findings about the

858
00:35:58,369 --> 00:36:03,500
inclusion of far red light and this

859
00:36:01,369 --> 00:36:06,108
turns out to be a massive variable where

860
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:07,909
he's seen things and basal crops and his

861
00:36:06,108 --> 00:36:10,549
reproduces work with other scientists

862
00:36:07,909 --> 00:36:12,649
that you could like increase that little

863
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:15,470
bit of for red light and then greatly

864
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:18,980
decrease all of the rest of the ppfd or

865
00:36:15,469 --> 00:36:22,338
the photosynthetic photon flux density

866
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:26,088
and still see increased biomass

867
00:36:22,338 --> 00:36:29,869
production and increased secondary

868
00:36:26,088 --> 00:36:31,519
metabolite formation so that is a big

869
00:36:29,869 --> 00:36:33,318
deal because we're always working

870
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:36,199
towards in controlled environments

871
00:36:33,318 --> 00:36:38,719
what is peak efficiency look like how do

872
00:36:36,199 --> 00:36:42,289
we reduce our carbon footprint to the

873
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:44,929
absolute you know smallest it can be but

874
00:36:42,289 --> 00:36:48,019
for those of us were focusing more and

875
00:36:44,929 --> 00:36:50,259
on a biopharmaceutical perspective and

876
00:36:48,019 --> 00:36:52,309
needing to have consistent chemistry

877
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:54,339
needing to use these controlled

878
00:36:52,309 --> 00:36:57,799
environments is absolutely imperative

879
00:36:54,338 --> 00:37:00,769
the diversity in fuel drum cannabis is

880
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:03,560
pre tremendous and I'm in love with it

881
00:37:00,769 --> 00:37:04,789
and I love to consume it myself and want

882
00:37:03,559 --> 00:37:06,650
that to be the lion's share of the

883
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:10,039
industry but I think there's a very

884
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:11,869
special place for these kind of more

885
00:37:10,039 --> 00:37:14,210
targeted solutions that the LEDs can

886
00:37:11,869 --> 00:37:16,309
provide but energy becomes the biggest

887
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:17,960
concern in consideration which is why

888
00:37:16,309 --> 00:37:19,699
I've been on a technical advisory

889
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:23,480
committee for the resource innovation

890
00:37:19,699 --> 00:37:25,639
Institute and REI has been working to

891
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:28,519
really for the first time map the

892
00:37:25,639 --> 00:37:32,449
footprint of producers and to become

893
00:37:28,519 --> 00:37:34,940
very fine toothcomb analyzing the

894
00:37:32,449 --> 00:37:38,659
producers inputs especially related to

895
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:40,369
lighting and HVAC and both for indoor

896
00:37:38,659 --> 00:37:43,368
and outdoor producers as well as

897
00:37:40,369 --> 00:37:44,150
greenhouse and that's that's been really

898
00:37:43,369 --> 00:37:46,369
useful but

899
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:48,500
- this new research and photo biology is

900
00:37:46,369 --> 00:37:51,470
illustrating a path by which we can use

901
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:53,389
greatly less energy which of course led

902
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:57,348
is compared to high intensity discharge

903
00:37:53,389 --> 00:37:59,480
features fixtures greatly reduced the

904
00:37:57,349 --> 00:38:03,500
overall energy I mean something like 50%

905
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:05,929
less energy than 1,000 watt HPS for our

906
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:09,019
current LED solutions and 40% less

907
00:38:05,929 --> 00:38:11,328
energy for the HVAC because we have way

908
00:38:09,019 --> 00:38:14,059
less thermal load and then when you add

909
00:38:11,329 --> 00:38:16,220
dimming in which we use lots of dimming

910
00:38:14,059 --> 00:38:18,289
so that we're using targeted you mole or

911
00:38:16,219 --> 00:38:20,538
targeted ppfd for different

912
00:38:18,289 --> 00:38:22,700
developmental stages you see a net

913
00:38:20,539 --> 00:38:25,760
reduction around like 70 to 80 percent

914
00:38:22,699 --> 00:38:28,578
beyond a thousand watt HPS and if you

915
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:30,619
look at our footprint as a facility at

916
00:38:28,579 --> 00:38:33,109
proof we only have about seven thousand

917
00:38:30,619 --> 00:38:34,869
square foot of blooming canopy then

918
00:38:33,108 --> 00:38:36,769
though we're in a 60,000 square foot

919
00:38:34,869 --> 00:38:38,900
controlled environment warehouse with

920
00:38:36,769 --> 00:38:41,449
all these chambers we have a much

921
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:44,028
smaller carbon footprint than all kinds

922
00:38:41,449 --> 00:38:46,338
of other industrial warehouses that are

923
00:38:44,028 --> 00:38:48,380
our neighbors and our close proximity in

924
00:38:46,338 --> 00:38:50,568
Northeast Portland so I'm proud of where

925
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:52,519
we've gotten to but I promised that in

926
00:38:50,568 --> 00:38:55,159
the very near future we're going to go

927
00:38:52,519 --> 00:38:58,460
much farther being able to combine with

928
00:38:55,159 --> 00:39:01,159
batteries and photovoltaics and even

929
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:03,829
more efficient light emitting solutions

930
00:39:01,159 --> 00:39:06,019
like the newest generation of fluence

931
00:39:03,829 --> 00:39:09,440
tech like the Viper tubes and spider

932
00:39:06,019 --> 00:39:11,778
Suz it gets to a point where you really

933
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:14,480
really are using nominal amounts of

934
00:39:11,778 --> 00:39:16,250
power to be able to provide these rich

935
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,750
environments but that's actually not the

936
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:19,130
most exciting part of photo biology

937
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:21,710
although it's a really important thing

938
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:24,230
for me and Troy I know a lot of the

939
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:27,440
people who listen to your work but

940
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:29,929
probably more exciting is really that we

941
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:31,970
can greatly affect morphology so the

942
00:39:29,929 --> 00:39:33,769
structure of the plant which when you're

943
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:36,939
dealing with plants that are very

944
00:39:33,769 --> 00:39:40,730
compact and very lanky in a spectrum and

945
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:42,220
you want compact plants in an indoor

946
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:44,449
environment that allow for you to have

947
00:39:42,219 --> 00:39:47,328
consistent canopies with as little

948
00:39:44,449 --> 00:39:49,159
intervention as possible lighting can

949
00:39:47,329 --> 00:39:51,740
play a very significant role in the

950
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:54,230
structure of plants clearly broad

951
00:39:51,739 --> 00:39:56,389
spectrum from very early on as a

952
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:57,440
resulted in just a level of vigor that

953
00:39:56,389 --> 00:39:58,969
is

954
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:02,720
you know like what you'd expect to see

955
00:39:58,969 --> 00:40:04,909
in a Sun grown crop I'm unlike relying

956
00:40:02,719 --> 00:40:07,399
exclusively on orange light from HBS

957
00:40:04,909 --> 00:40:11,779
fixtures which never look quite like

958
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:13,789
some grown crops again the most exciting

959
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:16,099
pieces the photochemistry and it's

960
00:40:13,789 --> 00:40:18,019
what's happening at the end stage so

961
00:40:16,099 --> 00:40:21,440
we're seeing really fascinating things

962
00:40:18,019 --> 00:40:23,599
with using broad spectrum wavelengths

963
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:26,960
the inclusion of specifically green

964
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:29,210
light to create broad spectrum and fill

965
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:32,030
out what you're often missing and the

966
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:34,220
other fixtures and actually one of the

967
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:36,650
interesting things is we've my best data

968
00:40:34,219 --> 00:40:39,259
around turkey production from the early

969
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:41,450
research and of the garage and basements

970
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:43,520
actually Illustrated that ceramic metal

971
00:40:41,449 --> 00:40:45,318
halides we're producing the best

972
00:40:43,519 --> 00:40:47,239
terpenes of any lighting solution that

973
00:40:45,318 --> 00:40:49,670
we had access to at the time it really

974
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:52,098
ceramic metal halides are kind of an old

975
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:55,430
technology again relying on gas filled

976
00:40:52,099 --> 00:40:57,140
bulbs that are really not consistent in

977
00:40:55,429 --> 00:40:58,848
their expression the moment you plug

978
00:40:57,139 --> 00:41:01,190
them in like any other gas filled bulb

979
00:40:58,849 --> 00:41:04,160
it's already on a gradation where you're

980
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:07,789
losing intensity as well as wavelength

981
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:09,739
and so if you want to spit or further

982
00:41:07,789 --> 00:41:13,130
they're using a lot of electricity and

983
00:41:09,739 --> 00:41:14,989
they're producing a lot of heat and they

984
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:16,700
just and they're distributing light in a

985
00:41:14,989 --> 00:41:19,608
way that needs reflectors it's not

986
00:41:16,699 --> 00:41:21,919
directional and you can't dim them and

987
00:41:19,608 --> 00:41:24,049
there's all these huge issues that those

988
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,990
were by far the best terpene producing

989
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:30,289
lights so we work to emulate that they

990
00:41:26,989 --> 00:41:32,659
know that the physio spec spectrum that

991
00:41:30,289 --> 00:41:34,190
you see influence is really emulating

992
00:41:32,659 --> 00:41:36,710
that but now we're going well beyond

993
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:39,200
that or I know that what we're doing at

994
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:41,300
proof will illustrate paths forward for

995
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:44,598
targeted phytochemistry paired with

996
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:46,089
particular cultivars and cultural

997
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:49,130
practices and environmental strategies

998
00:41:46,088 --> 00:41:49,909
that become recipes for chemical

999
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:52,838
varieties

1000
00:41:49,909 --> 00:41:55,429
that's so photo biology given that light

1001
00:41:52,838 --> 00:41:57,108
once everything else is in balance I

1002
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:59,719
would argue it's likely the most

1003
00:41:57,108 --> 00:42:02,210
important variable the quality of light

1004
00:41:59,719 --> 00:42:04,489
and the intensity of light as well as

1005
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:07,460
the consistency of light and producing

1006
00:42:04,489 --> 00:42:09,529
consistent kheema bars and so you really

1007
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:11,300
have to get dragged into this discipline

1008
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:13,460
if you're a careful cat

1009
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:15,530
know this producer and want to know how

1010
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:18,740
to do that you really you have to learn

1011
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:21,230
a lot about physics and light it turns

1012
00:42:18,739 --> 00:42:23,779
out so photo biology is the second

1013
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:26,420
discipline in the Innovation Lab the

1014
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:28,910
third discipline is the one most true to

1015
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:31,539
your podcast which is that we're

1016
00:42:28,909 --> 00:42:34,429
passionate about organic crop production

1017
00:42:31,539 --> 00:42:36,650
I've worked a lot with living soil I've

1018
00:42:34,429 --> 00:42:38,750
had the blessing of working with some

1019
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:40,820
incredible people as I have worked with

1020
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:43,429
all sorts of different raised beds and

1021
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:46,730
shared root zones and hyper complex

1022
00:42:43,429 --> 00:42:48,969
Rises fears but required no additional

1023
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:52,280
nutrient input beyond green mulch and

1024
00:42:48,969 --> 00:42:54,799
some teas and I've really worked with

1025
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:59,510
that I've had about four years

1026
00:42:54,800 --> 00:43:00,590
experience with living soils I had some

1027
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:02,750
of the best candidates I've ever

1028
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:05,390
produced in my life unquestionably come

1029
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:10,010
out of living soils and I also had some

1030
00:43:05,389 --> 00:43:12,109
major crashes where I was even with my

1031
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:13,880
best resources and I'm calling on people

1032
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:15,320
that are brilliant and a lot of

1033
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:17,240
resources present and trying to do

1034
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:20,210
analytics and everything I have

1035
00:43:17,239 --> 00:43:23,929
literally watched an entire garden just

1036
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:26,030
crash and burn I that said I know that

1037
00:43:23,929 --> 00:43:28,429
there are we are much more sophisticated

1038
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:31,280
thanks to you and many other people who

1039
00:43:28,429 --> 00:43:33,199
are on the frontier of educating and

1040
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:35,540
bringing popular education and rum the

1041
00:43:33,199 --> 00:43:38,750
dynamics of working with living swill

1042
00:43:35,539 --> 00:43:42,050
and yet still I realized that proof I

1043
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:44,750
needed a kind of a modified approach it

1044
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:46,940
is unfortunately currently producing a

1045
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:49,909
bit of effluent and that we are not

1046
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:53,720
reusing our media we are custom mixing

1047
00:43:49,909 --> 00:43:56,329
all of our own organic inputs and we do

1048
00:43:53,719 --> 00:43:58,730
some very scientific process to organize

1049
00:43:56,329 --> 00:44:02,299
our organic crop production in a way

1050
00:43:58,730 --> 00:44:04,219
that as close to really consistent

1051
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:06,140
reliable results as possible so that

1052
00:44:04,219 --> 00:44:07,939
whenever I'm interacting with scientists

1053
00:44:06,139 --> 00:44:10,009
who say come on if you're doing that

1054
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:11,869
kind of research the only way you'll

1055
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:14,510
establish a meaningful baseline is to

1056
00:44:11,869 --> 00:44:17,359
use mineral salt fertilizers and I am

1057
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:19,820
adamantly opposed to using mineral salt

1058
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:22,160
fertilizers other than in very limited

1059
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:24,920
expressions for very particular kinds of

1060
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:27,889
research but in general for

1061
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:29,900
our product it's just imperative to me

1062
00:44:27,889 --> 00:44:31,819
that be both clean green certified and

1063
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:34,519
go way beyond what most people consider

1064
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:37,280
normal organics and then go more into a

1065
00:44:34,519 --> 00:44:39,530
precision AG modality so how I've chosen

1066
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:43,970
to do that this incredible team that

1067
00:44:39,530 --> 00:44:46,370
proof is really to test each individual

1068
00:44:43,969 --> 00:44:48,829
input we source most of the things that

1069
00:44:46,369 --> 00:44:51,559
we can locally and then we actually do

1070
00:44:48,829 --> 00:44:54,349
analytics through a lab in South Florida

1071
00:44:51,559 --> 00:44:57,980
called QA l as quick turnaround really

1072
00:44:54,349 --> 00:45:00,980
affordable big AG lab and so we test the

1073
00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:02,990
inputs consistently then we custom mix

1074
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:04,429
it and currently we're still hand mixing

1075
00:45:02,989 --> 00:45:06,679
for our whole facility although we're

1076
00:45:04,429 --> 00:45:10,309
bringing on automation for the mixing

1077
00:45:06,679 --> 00:45:13,909
over this year um then we measure the

1078
00:45:10,309 --> 00:45:15,259
substrate the leachate and those are two

1079
00:45:13,909 --> 00:45:18,049
independent things that we're testing

1080
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:20,180
and when we can which is not always

1081
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:22,580
consistent right now we measure the

1082
00:45:20,179 --> 00:45:25,279
tissue as well and we're looking at

1083
00:45:22,579 --> 00:45:28,849
micro and macro availability of

1084
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:31,760
nutrients and we're able to through all

1085
00:45:28,849 --> 00:45:33,980
four of those analytical processes which

1086
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:35,870
has not been cheap and has been a huge

1087
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:38,389
blessing to be able to finally get

1088
00:45:35,869 --> 00:45:40,519
insight into we are getting really

1089
00:45:38,389 --> 00:45:42,920
really good at understanding what

1090
00:45:40,519 --> 00:45:45,590
particular team of ours need to flourish

1091
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:48,650
and learning that there is a broad range

1092
00:45:45,590 --> 00:45:51,200
of diversity in the solutions we need to

1093
00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:53,720
employ additionally we have a

1094
00:45:51,199 --> 00:45:56,419
fertigation system that took me seven

1095
00:45:53,719 --> 00:45:59,569
months to design where we do apply some

1096
00:45:56,420 --> 00:46:02,630
liquid nutrients that are of course all

1097
00:45:59,570 --> 00:46:04,490
organic but that allows for us to deal

1098
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:06,829
with some of the crop diversity issues

1099
00:46:04,489 --> 00:46:09,409
where there's never a one-size-fits-all

1100
00:46:06,829 --> 00:46:12,469
solution in our facility we're really

1101
00:46:09,409 --> 00:46:15,019
targeting for groups of cultivars

1102
00:46:12,469 --> 00:46:17,869
they're grouped together by length of

1103
00:46:15,019 --> 00:46:20,440
maturing time which is one huge variable

1104
00:46:17,869 --> 00:46:23,059
compact and lanky plants is another

1105
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:26,480
another axis by which to look at them

1106
00:46:23,059 --> 00:46:28,610
and also looking at specific nutritional

1107
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:30,320
requirements outside of those things

1108
00:46:28,610 --> 00:46:32,630
because if you obviously have a longer

1109
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:36,730
maturing plant versus a short maturing

1110
00:46:32,630 --> 00:46:38,460
plant that changes a schedule of inputs

1111
00:46:36,730 --> 00:46:40,289
but for

1112
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:43,889
there are plants that we found that are

1113
00:46:40,289 --> 00:46:47,219
clearly more acid loving and plants that

1114
00:46:43,889 --> 00:46:52,108
are more base loving plants that need in

1115
00:46:47,219 --> 00:46:54,269
our six part dolomite lime input you

1116
00:46:52,108 --> 00:46:56,699
know more of the medium grade less of

1117
00:46:54,269 --> 00:46:58,889
the fine grade or these sort of

1118
00:46:56,699 --> 00:47:01,469
strategies that don't result on you know

1119
00:46:58,889 --> 00:47:03,449
kind of the classic put more cal-mag in

1120
00:47:01,469 --> 00:47:05,639
this one just needs that orb it's like

1121
00:47:03,449 --> 00:47:09,539
actually formulate in a targeted way

1122
00:47:05,639 --> 00:47:11,549
from our initial media mix the lion's

1123
00:47:09,539 --> 00:47:13,349
share of what the plant will need and to

1124
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:16,500
do that for all of these groups of

1125
00:47:13,349 --> 00:47:19,200
plants in this complex facility were you

1126
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:23,460
know we could be between 14 and 20 mm

1127
00:47:19,199 --> 00:47:26,579
plants so being able to use analytics to

1128
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:29,309
validate the nutrition and availability

1129
00:47:26,579 --> 00:47:32,130
of nutrition as the fundament and then

1130
00:47:29,309 --> 00:47:34,679
to work on enhancing that with biology

1131
00:47:32,130 --> 00:47:37,559
through a variety of practices has been

1132
00:47:34,679 --> 00:47:40,139
the sort of mainstay of our organic crop

1133
00:47:37,559 --> 00:47:42,088
production program and that is the third

1134
00:47:40,139 --> 00:47:44,579
point of research which is actually a

1135
00:47:42,088 --> 00:47:47,608
really excellent in-house soil scientist

1136
00:47:44,579 --> 00:47:50,519
who's on our team in Meg Haussmann who's

1137
00:47:47,608 --> 00:47:53,369
been doing that work I'm a person who's

1138
00:47:50,519 --> 00:47:55,380
actually leading or indeed for me for

1139
00:47:53,369 --> 00:47:58,380
the Innovation Lab is an amazing plant

1140
00:47:55,380 --> 00:48:01,769
scientist named she's me Kylee Mendonsa

1141
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:05,430
and so we've got some increasing

1142
00:48:01,769 --> 00:48:09,269
scientific Pro s working together along

1143
00:48:05,429 --> 00:48:11,699
with lean I our grower and Todd saucy

1144
00:48:09,269 --> 00:48:13,739
or operating director but what's been

1145
00:48:11,699 --> 00:48:16,169
incredible is having this facility that

1146
00:48:13,739 --> 00:48:18,118
can essentially facilitate all three

1147
00:48:16,170 --> 00:48:21,059
kinds of research that I've just

1148
00:48:18,119 --> 00:48:24,358
described at scale as we are a

1149
00:48:21,059 --> 00:48:26,369
commercial producer and that as I

1150
00:48:24,358 --> 00:48:27,569
brought my own plants into the facility

1151
00:48:26,369 --> 00:48:30,000
which are things that I've been working

1152
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:32,490
on hybridizing based on analytical

1153
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,050
results and I've developed sort of

1154
00:48:32,489 --> 00:48:37,679
cultural practices and environmental

1155
00:48:34,050 --> 00:48:40,109
targets for over the last decade we are

1156
00:48:37,679 --> 00:48:42,929
seeing amazing results tab some of which

1157
00:48:40,108 --> 00:48:45,420
I just texted you earlier today because

1158
00:48:42,929 --> 00:48:48,239
we just I was happy to see the beginning

1159
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:52,059
of 2019 a review of the best smoke and

1160
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:54,729
organ of 2018 and to happen to see a

1161
00:48:52,059 --> 00:48:56,980
two of the five reviews about new chemo

1162
00:48:54,730 --> 00:48:59,800
boards that we produced one of which is

1163
00:48:56,980 --> 00:49:02,079
a type 2 plant which I believe people

1164
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:05,160
should be ready for the fact that type

1165
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:07,840
2s are going to be far more desirable in

1166
00:49:05,159 --> 00:49:11,339
coming years and I think type ones

1167
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:13,780
you're currently you see high THC plants

1168
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:16,470
receiving the most attention in the

1169
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:19,240
commercial market but type 2 plants are

1170
00:49:16,469 --> 00:49:23,349
unbelievably versatile and that you can

1171
00:49:19,239 --> 00:49:27,309
produce a huge range of sort of ratios

1172
00:49:23,349 --> 00:49:30,039
of THC and CBD as the engine of this

1173
00:49:27,309 --> 00:49:32,590
plant but then bring in really novel

1174
00:49:30,039 --> 00:49:34,630
chemical varieties by crashing type

1175
00:49:32,590 --> 00:49:38,050
warms in the type threes and so forth

1176
00:49:34,630 --> 00:49:40,450
because type threes and twos are vastly

1177
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:42,460
less likely to be bottle necked right

1178
00:49:40,449 --> 00:49:44,439
now in the way that type ones are you

1179
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:47,199
know there's a notion that when you're

1180
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:50,110
selecting plants for hybridization in a

1181
00:49:47,199 --> 00:49:52,359
population of less than 200 you're going

1182
00:49:50,110 --> 00:49:54,579
to create a genetic bottleneck that

1183
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:56,680
essentially is losing a huge amount of

1184
00:49:54,579 --> 00:49:58,929
traits that are very important if we're

1185
00:49:56,679 --> 00:50:02,109
seeking to adapt to changing times or

1186
00:49:58,929 --> 00:50:04,989
make these new vigorous you know early

1187
00:50:02,110 --> 00:50:09,180
maturing pathogen resistant exciting

1188
00:50:04,989 --> 00:50:12,849
chemo VARs but I know that type twos

1189
00:50:09,179 --> 00:50:15,009
actually have been winning cups secretly

1190
00:50:12,849 --> 00:50:16,929
like there's stories that you can

1191
00:50:15,010 --> 00:50:19,600
Rousseau told me recently about the

1192
00:50:16,929 --> 00:50:21,849
rainbow gummies that one in a type-1

1193
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:24,610
category a high THC category in the

1194
00:50:21,849 --> 00:50:27,429
Emerald cup was by far the most desired

1195
00:50:24,610 --> 00:50:29,740
cultivar and it was a Terp Emmaline

1196
00:50:27,429 --> 00:50:31,690
dominant type 2 which is rare because

1197
00:50:29,739 --> 00:50:34,719
most type twos and type threes are

1198
00:50:31,690 --> 00:50:38,820
you're seeing dominant so this is a less

1199
00:50:34,719 --> 00:50:42,069
relaxing sedative form of Medicine and

1200
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:44,230
similarly astral works has become real

1201
00:50:42,070 --> 00:50:46,120
people's choice in Oregon it's been

1202
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:48,670
written up as the best CBD products and

1203
00:50:46,119 --> 00:50:50,829
Leafly and so forth and a bit really

1204
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:53,440
after works as a turpentine dominant

1205
00:50:50,829 --> 00:50:56,259
anthro seinem flush like deep deep

1206
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:58,450
purple brilliant flower that's just it

1207
00:50:56,260 --> 00:51:01,290
smells like nothing I've smelled before

1208
00:50:58,449 --> 00:51:04,569
it's in that hazy serpentine just

1209
00:51:01,289 --> 00:51:05,480
perfuse brightness and then it's also a

1210
00:51:04,570 --> 00:51:08,269
under

1211
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:10,219
we've oblivious heavy yielding early

1212
00:51:08,269 --> 00:51:11,900
maturing plant it's got an array of

1213
00:51:10,219 --> 00:51:14,779
other compounds like a minor

1214
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:17,389
cannabidiol Varon with CBD v feature and

1215
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:19,519
a lot of Turkey and diversity and

1216
00:51:17,389 --> 00:51:23,839
intensity it's coming in very high oil

1217
00:51:19,519 --> 00:51:25,608
I'm over 3% oil and so any case these

1218
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:27,829
are things that are starting to be

1219
00:51:25,608 --> 00:51:31,940
accepted in a market it otherwise is

1220
00:51:27,829 --> 00:51:35,509
driven to my horror entirely by THC

1221
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:38,650
percentage if you look at BBS analytical

1222
00:51:35,510 --> 00:51:41,840
data which is the best market-based

1223
00:51:38,650 --> 00:51:43,820
analytical perspective on what products

1224
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:46,789
are selling in Oregon or California

1225
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:49,160
Washington etc um you really see an

1226
00:51:46,789 --> 00:51:52,369
Oregon people are buying and paying more

1227
00:51:49,159 --> 00:51:54,170
for high THC cannabis but the problem

1228
00:51:52,369 --> 00:51:57,050
with this is that you know in the

1229
00:51:54,170 --> 00:51:58,220
biosynthesis of these cannabinoids and

1230
00:51:57,050 --> 00:52:00,280
terpenoids

1231
00:51:58,219 --> 00:52:03,409
you actually have a shared pathway

1232
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:05,390
between the path that produces

1233
00:52:03,409 --> 00:52:07,549
cannabinoids in the plant from group

1234
00:52:05,389 --> 00:52:09,858
glucose and the class that produces

1235
00:52:07,550 --> 00:52:13,369
terpenoids and this is the Geron o

1236
00:52:09,858 --> 00:52:15,108
pyrophosphate which you're going to have

1237
00:52:13,369 --> 00:52:17,960
limited resources to make all these

1238
00:52:15,108 --> 00:52:20,599
drugs you're choosing do we send all of

1239
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:22,429
those resources to this one note you

1240
00:52:20,599 --> 00:52:24,349
know that we can make synthetically or

1241
00:52:22,429 --> 00:52:27,409
that looks like marinol or just be huge

1242
00:52:24,349 --> 00:52:28,809
THC products or you do diversify and

1243
00:52:27,409 --> 00:52:32,569
start sending more of that energy

1244
00:52:28,809 --> 00:52:35,299
towards turpenoid production and more

1245
00:52:32,570 --> 00:52:36,830
poly chemical perspectives because one

1246
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:38,019
day soon we're not just going to be

1247
00:52:36,829 --> 00:52:39,710
talking about terpenes and cannabinoids

1248
00:52:38,019 --> 00:52:42,949
we're going to be talking about

1249
00:52:39,710 --> 00:52:45,050
aldehydes esters ketones flavonoids and

1250
00:52:42,949 --> 00:52:48,019
all of the other important therapeutic

1251
00:52:45,050 --> 00:52:51,320
agents that this plant is so willing to

1252
00:52:48,019 --> 00:52:53,690
produce so the bottom line is I'm

1253
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:55,700
excited to see some consumer awareness

1254
00:52:53,690 --> 00:52:57,980
growing around the fact that it's very

1255
00:52:55,699 --> 00:53:00,589
likely you will have more pleasure and

1256
00:52:57,980 --> 00:53:03,230
much better effects from the next gen

1257
00:53:00,590 --> 00:53:05,780
type 2 plants coming online after the

1258
00:53:03,230 --> 00:53:09,730
amazing work of people like Lawrence

1259
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:12,830
Ringo of soham and Jamie from resin and

1260
00:53:09,730 --> 00:53:15,019
you know people who have really changed

1261
00:53:12,829 --> 00:53:18,529
the world by bringing type threes back

1262
00:53:15,019 --> 00:53:19,159
and type twos back but I expect in the

1263
00:53:18,530 --> 00:53:21,680
Maine

1264
00:53:19,159 --> 00:53:23,869
retail sector as people start to get

1265
00:53:21,679 --> 00:53:25,250
more sophisticated type 2's are going to

1266
00:53:23,869 --> 00:53:27,920
play a much bigger role because they're

1267
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:29,659
just very desirable but we're seeing in

1268
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:31,490
addition to really exciting type twos

1269
00:53:29,659 --> 00:53:34,369
like Astra Works which is by the way a

1270
00:53:31,489 --> 00:53:36,619
hybrid they produced from tangerine haze

1271
00:53:34,369 --> 00:53:40,069
mail that was unbelievably vigorous and

1272
00:53:36,619 --> 00:53:42,829
imparted Turpin lean and vigor and

1273
00:53:40,070 --> 00:53:45,710
anthocyanin to anything that was using

1274
00:53:42,829 --> 00:53:49,039
that in a hybrid with and worked with

1275
00:53:45,710 --> 00:53:51,949
Laurence Ringo's Carly sue which was the

1276
00:53:49,039 --> 00:53:54,769
earliest maturing heaviest yielding most

1277
00:53:51,949 --> 00:53:56,899
desirable type 3 flower I personally

1278
00:53:54,769 --> 00:53:59,829
found after auditioning something like

1279
00:53:56,900 --> 00:54:02,420
25 varieties in it and a year and a half

1280
00:53:59,829 --> 00:54:04,130
and just as something that's worked

1281
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:06,980
really well for patients the particular

1282
00:54:04,130 --> 00:54:09,680
variety I had clearly had the CBD V

1283
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:13,269
feature working with seizure disorder

1284
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:15,889
patients the inclusion of CBD V clearly

1285
00:54:13,269 --> 00:54:19,159
anecdotally increased the odds of

1286
00:54:15,889 --> 00:54:22,159
efficacy and success and working to

1287
00:54:19,159 --> 00:54:24,859
suppress the frequency of seizures so

1288
00:54:22,159 --> 00:54:27,799
that plant is I just think a legendary

1289
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:31,130
plant but then being able to create this

1290
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:32,300
hybrid was this was it like exactly the

1291
00:54:31,130 --> 00:54:34,250
outcome I was looking for

1292
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:36,289
I found a bridge between those worlds

1293
00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:38,289
and have a type two that it's not you're

1294
00:54:36,289 --> 00:54:41,150
seeing dominant and that it's just

1295
00:54:38,289 --> 00:54:42,710
amazingly useful but we're also seeing

1296
00:54:41,150 --> 00:54:45,170
just in Turkey in production and the

1297
00:54:42,710 --> 00:54:47,809
type one's huge concentrations of

1298
00:54:45,170 --> 00:54:49,550
terpenes one of the problems with

1299
00:54:47,809 --> 00:54:51,860
measuring terpenes is that we have a

1300
00:54:49,550 --> 00:54:54,530
huge amount of inter lab variability and

1301
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:57,230
in Oregon we have a program called or

1302
00:54:54,530 --> 00:54:59,870
lap which is meant to govern the labs

1303
00:54:57,230 --> 00:55:02,599
and ensure consistency and the approach

1304
00:54:59,869 --> 00:55:04,549
and process that they're using I'm going

1305
00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:07,339
back to Pat Marshall one of the amazing

1306
00:55:04,550 --> 00:55:13,190
things that he did was resolved to use a

1307
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:14,600
method 8270 which is the it's a method

1308
00:55:13,190 --> 00:55:16,789
that's been used by the EPA for

1309
00:55:14,599 --> 00:55:19,339
measuring organic solvents for more than

1310
00:55:16,789 --> 00:55:21,949
40 years and the very mature method with

1311
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:24,950
lots of lots of redundancy and quality

1312
00:55:21,949 --> 00:55:27,139
control built into it so he used a great

1313
00:55:24,949 --> 00:55:28,250
method these are the three things I

1314
00:55:27,139 --> 00:55:30,500
think are important when you're looking

1315
00:55:28,250 --> 00:55:32,989
at a lab what is the level of experience

1316
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:35,329
and the credibility of the practitioner

1317
00:55:32,989 --> 00:55:36,979
number one number two what methods are

1318
00:55:35,329 --> 00:55:39,949
they using number three what equipment

1319
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:41,659
are they using and I think when you get

1320
00:55:39,949 --> 00:55:44,329
sophisticated at looking at those three

1321
00:55:41,659 --> 00:55:46,519
variables you find that actually even in

1322
00:55:44,329 --> 00:55:48,230
the regulated economy there are a lot of

1323
00:55:46,519 --> 00:55:52,250
labs that I do not consider to be

1324
00:55:48,230 --> 00:55:53,599
passing muster but Pat was special and

1325
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:56,269
that he had a great method was

1326
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:58,160
unbelievably experienced he was mainly

1327
00:55:56,269 --> 00:56:00,108
focused on GC at the time which is why

1328
00:55:58,159 --> 00:56:01,670
we got such great terpene data the

1329
00:56:00,108 --> 00:56:04,429
bottom line is the range of what

1330
00:56:01,670 --> 00:56:06,019
terpenes are being reported it varies

1331
00:56:04,429 --> 00:56:08,779
widely but I'm saying anywhere between

1332
00:56:06,019 --> 00:56:11,329
you know an average sample in the market

1333
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:14,960
or in the cultivation classic data it is

1334
00:56:11,329 --> 00:56:17,719
produced with 160 entries from single of

1335
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:19,730
skilled producers in Oregon an average

1336
00:56:17,719 --> 00:56:20,358
of like maybe one one and a half percent

1337
00:56:19,730 --> 00:56:23,900
oil

1338
00:56:20,358 --> 00:56:26,569
I consider 2% and up to be high oil

1339
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:28,010
I consider the cultivars coming out of

1340
00:56:26,570 --> 00:56:30,440
proof to be among the highest I

1341
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:33,589
personally seen in the market using

1342
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:35,420
Cascadia analytics as our baseline who

1343
00:56:33,588 --> 00:56:38,059
have demonstrated a pretty visionary

1344
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:40,490
approach to being market leaders and Al

1345
00:56:38,059 --> 00:56:43,549
both in California as well as in Oregon

1346
00:56:40,489 --> 00:56:46,639
providing a pretty unique approach to QC

1347
00:56:43,550 --> 00:56:51,619
for producers but I've not seen anything

1348
00:56:46,639 --> 00:56:55,069
over 5% um I am seeing in our varieties

1349
00:56:51,619 --> 00:56:57,619
a about a third of our current varieties

1350
00:56:55,070 --> 00:57:00,559
that are new ones that I've bred in the

1351
00:56:57,619 --> 00:57:02,088
4 to 5 percent range so hitting us high

1352
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:03,769
oil as I've seen and these are plants

1353
00:57:02,088 --> 00:57:06,108
when you harvest them literally with

1354
00:57:03,769 --> 00:57:08,119
like plastic gloves you just see oil all

1355
00:57:06,108 --> 00:57:11,480
over your hands they're just it's

1356
00:57:08,119 --> 00:57:13,220
unbelievable I mean and I find that

1357
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:16,699
really desirable and the effects are

1358
00:57:13,219 --> 00:57:20,269
really quite strong that we think about

1359
00:57:16,699 --> 00:57:21,829
high THC in a way actually for anybody

1360
00:57:20,269 --> 00:57:22,789
who is at the Emerald cup this year or

1361
00:57:21,829 --> 00:57:25,009
who wasn't there

1362
00:57:22,789 --> 00:57:27,980
you should go online and look at dr.

1363
00:57:25,010 --> 00:57:31,250
mark lewis's talk and is he just did a

1364
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:32,510
brilliant simple sort of expression of

1365
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:35,329
what's happened in the industry with

1366
00:57:32,510 --> 00:57:36,650
chemo bars and we see that over the

1367
00:57:35,329 --> 00:57:39,409
years we have been more successful

1368
00:57:36,650 --> 00:57:40,820
producing higher levels of THC that was

1369
00:57:39,409 --> 00:57:42,588
not just through breeding by the way

1370
00:57:40,820 --> 00:57:44,630
that was through light intensity and

1371
00:57:42,588 --> 00:57:46,009
production environments we were able to

1372
00:57:44,630 --> 00:57:46,579
evoke that because I've been able to

1373
00:57:46,010 --> 00:57:50,360
evoke very

1374
00:57:46,579 --> 00:57:53,480
hi THC from inbred lines or landrace

1375
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:55,789
cultivars that were clearly not not as

1376
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:57,409
intensively hybridized and just by

1377
00:57:55,789 --> 00:57:59,929
adding really intense light I would seem

1378
00:57:57,409 --> 00:58:03,409
lots of THC and very little other

1379
00:57:59,929 --> 00:58:05,089
compounds but as that's happened we've

1380
00:58:03,409 --> 00:58:07,969
seen consumers have increasingly

1381
00:58:05,090 --> 00:58:10,010
negative effects and so we know that

1382
00:58:07,969 --> 00:58:12,319
we're really good at serving this core

1383
00:58:10,010 --> 00:58:14,570
superuser market which is what the

1384
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:17,269
existing product mix is kind of

1385
00:58:14,570 --> 00:58:19,430
dominated by but being able to expand

1386
00:58:17,269 --> 00:58:22,130
into this utility where we're more

1387
00:58:19,429 --> 00:58:23,750
effective at serving say more women than

1388
00:58:22,130 --> 00:58:25,940
men because right now if you look at the

1389
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:28,250
BBS market data we're actually losing

1390
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:30,440
women as the regulated market is growing

1391
00:58:28,250 --> 00:58:32,960
we're serving less women than we were

1392
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:35,360
before that's a really big issue if you

1393
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:36,559
look at fact that everybody stands to

1394
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:40,250
benefit who has an endocannabinoid

1395
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:42,199
system from using cannabis products that

1396
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:45,050
are well formulated and balanced and

1397
00:58:42,199 --> 00:58:47,329
interesting and their profiles but for

1398
00:58:45,050 --> 00:58:48,950
some reason our product mix is driving

1399
00:58:47,329 --> 00:58:51,559
women away we're going to be more

1400
00:58:48,949 --> 00:58:53,689
effective in serving aging boomers and

1401
00:58:51,559 --> 00:58:55,670
this kind of end-of-life population and

1402
00:58:53,690 --> 00:58:58,519
all these other populations when we

1403
00:58:55,670 --> 00:59:01,880
cease to only have this kind of high THC

1404
00:58:58,519 --> 00:59:05,239
metric I'm but there are many ways to

1405
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:08,119
ameliorate the negative effects of the

1406
00:59:05,239 --> 00:59:10,759
psychoactivity of THC which you I love

1407
00:59:08,119 --> 00:59:12,559
THC and I'm I'm a happy type one

1408
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:15,020
consumer I really love type twos and

1409
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:18,469
threes as well but I've always consumed

1410
00:59:15,019 --> 00:59:21,619
type lunge but I I'm really concerned

1411
00:59:18,469 --> 00:59:24,949
that if we don't produce more terpenes

1412
00:59:21,619 --> 00:59:27,380
which is a great strategy to change and

1413
00:59:24,949 --> 00:59:29,839
affect the expression of the THC for the

1414
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:32,030
patients or more cannabidiol rich

1415
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:34,700
cultivars or more minor cannabinoid

1416
00:59:32,030 --> 00:59:36,920
featured cultivars and we're simply not

1417
00:59:34,699 --> 00:59:39,439
making the right products that the world

1418
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:42,710
needs the world needs a diverse array of

1419
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:44,599
products and that's a really important

1420
00:59:42,710 --> 00:59:46,670
theme that I see going forward both at

1421
00:59:44,599 --> 00:59:51,799
proof and for the industry on the whole

1422
00:59:46,670 --> 00:59:54,460
um so gosh can I just talked at you for

1423
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:56,750
a long time I hope that that was

1424
00:59:54,460 --> 00:59:58,730
reasonably well organized because I

1425
00:59:56,750 --> 01:00:01,480
don't think you've been able to get it

1426
00:59:58,730 --> 01:00:04,159
word in edgewise I apologize my friend

1427
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:06,320
no I have so many questions for you but

1428
01:00:04,159 --> 01:00:11,359
I know you're also out of time so I

1429
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:13,640
wanted to propose this what about if I

1430
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:15,590
save my questions and maybe had you back

1431
01:00:13,639 --> 01:00:17,480
on another time but also opened it up to

1432
01:00:15,590 --> 01:00:20,510
listeners to ask them questions cuz you

1433
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:23,210
I mean we you touched on so many really

1434
01:00:20,510 --> 01:00:25,840
important topics ranging from anything

1435
01:00:23,210 --> 01:00:28,460
from terroir and chemo type expression

1436
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:30,880
I'd love to find out you know what

1437
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:33,369
generalizations can you make based on

1438
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:36,019
you know the type of lighting or

1439
01:00:33,369 --> 01:00:38,059
nutrients or methodology around the

1440
01:00:36,019 --> 01:00:41,869
round growing that you might be able to

1441
01:00:38,059 --> 01:00:45,110
make for growers how this changed from

1442
01:00:41,869 --> 01:00:48,259
high Mersin plants over time as it has

1443
01:00:45,110 --> 01:00:51,170
affected patients or people who are

1444
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:52,730
using it for medical purposes I wrote

1445
01:00:51,170 --> 01:00:55,659
down what chemo type expressions are

1446
01:00:52,730 --> 01:00:57,889
most beneficial for for different

1447
01:00:55,659 --> 01:01:00,139
different uses there's just so many

1448
01:00:57,889 --> 01:01:03,199
questions I have for you oh and like how

1449
01:01:00,139 --> 01:01:05,389
stress response may affect chemo tipica

1450
01:01:03,199 --> 01:01:08,629
as well as one that I think that just is

1451
01:01:05,389 --> 01:01:10,219
a fascinating topic so I want to save

1452
01:01:08,630 --> 01:01:11,690
these questions would it be okay to have

1453
01:01:10,219 --> 01:01:13,279
you back on another time when you have

1454
01:01:11,690 --> 01:01:15,409
more time and we could we could just do

1455
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:18,650
a little quick short answer QA

1456
01:01:15,409 --> 01:01:21,469
I would be honored my friend I would

1457
01:01:18,650 --> 01:01:23,720
love to be on in the near future when it

1458
01:01:21,469 --> 01:01:26,809
works for both of us and yeah have it be

1459
01:01:23,719 --> 01:01:28,339
more fun and having to give you an

1460
01:01:26,809 --> 01:01:30,829
opportunity to respond to your questions

1461
01:01:28,340 --> 01:01:32,960
and anybody else's but and all of those

1462
01:01:30,829 --> 01:01:34,429
questions you just mentioned are really

1463
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:37,670
important and there are a lot of

1464
01:01:34,429 --> 01:01:39,259
thoughts so yes and it's a joy to have

1465
01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:40,880
time with you today and I know you have

1466
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:43,940
a lot of other exciting content coming

1467
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:46,309
but I'm looking forward to chiming in in

1468
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:47,599
the future as soon as you're ready great

1469
01:01:46,309 --> 01:01:49,909
well thank you so much for your time

1470
01:01:47,599 --> 01:01:51,739
today Jeremy great to talk to you and I

1471
01:01:49,909 --> 01:01:53,359
look forward to coming down and actually

1472
01:01:51,739 --> 01:01:55,159
checking out proof it's it's been on my

1473
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:58,490
list and after hearing more about it I

1474
01:01:55,159 --> 01:01:59,779
really can't wait to see it well I can't

1475
01:01:58,489 --> 01:02:01,279
wait to have you and thanks for

1476
01:01:59,780 --> 01:02:02,030
everything you do Todd thanks for this

1477
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:03,680
podcast

1478
01:02:02,030 --> 01:02:05,720
thanks for the community that you bring

1479
01:02:03,679 --> 01:02:08,269
together around it and for all the

1480
01:02:05,719 --> 01:02:08,869
inspiring visionary solutions that are

1481
01:02:08,269 --> 01:02:11,509
proposed

1482
01:02:08,869 --> 01:02:13,759
