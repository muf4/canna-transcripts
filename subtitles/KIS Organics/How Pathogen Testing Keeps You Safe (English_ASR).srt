00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,960
hey guys so today I want to talk to you

2
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:07,599
about pathogen testing pathogen testing

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:10,120
is a great tool to determine if you're

4
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:13,678
dealing with an issue like fusarium

5
00:00:10,119 --> 00:00:15,759
pythium or hopen vroid hlvd is a

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,879
significant pathogen affecting cannabis

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:22,240
and the symptoms of hlvd are stunted

8
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:24,719
growth closis and necrosis in some cases

9
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:26,198
um commonly thought of as dutting is

10
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:27,960
what you hear a lot of people talk about

11
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:29,640
in the industry and it's important to

12
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,320
note that infected plants may not show

13
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,280
any visible symptoms at all which is why

14
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,359
early detection is crucial and it can

15
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:39,320
actually show up in seeds now too though

16
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:41,320
at much lower rates so testing your

17
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:43,759
plants is the best way to know if this

18
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,439
is this is a potential issue or to avoid

19
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:49,000
bringing something into your garden that

20
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:50,959
could be an issue down the road um so we

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,119
offer testing through Three Rivers

22
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,759
biotech the costs per test are only $15

23
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:58,000
per test but there is a five test

24
00:00:55,759 --> 00:01:00,000
minimum um after you order your test

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,079
here's the supplies and the process for

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,359
submitting a sample so I got this in the

27
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:07,000
mail and I wanted to show you guys the

28
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:10,239
whole process and take you through it as

29
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,359
well as what comes in the kit and

30
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:16,158
opening it up I have my sample tubes

31
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:16,159
this is where I'll put my

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,799
sample I have an envelope for packaging

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,200
and mailing that sample

34
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,680
back and then I have my instructions

35
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,560
from them on how to take a sample and

36
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,560
I'll walk through this

37
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:39,000
today as well as my sheet for recording

38
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,599
my sample with the barcode that I'm

39
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,759
going to match up with the plant that

40
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:42,759
I'm

41
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:48,959
testing so there's a list of supplies

42
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:50,359
that you're going to need in order to do

43
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:54,359
this you're going to need scissors or

44
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:57,959
pruning shears bleach uh a spray bottle

45
00:01:54,359 --> 00:02:00,840
paper towels a pen disposable gloves and

46
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:03,399
a cooler with ice inside or fridge

47
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,439
access I have a cooler over there but um

48
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:06,359
I'm actually just going to take the

49
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:09,878
samples and put them directly in the

50
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:13,280
fridge so the first step is to sterilize

51
00:02:09,878 --> 00:02:15,560
your scissors in a 10% bleach solution

52
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,039
for at least 10 minutes and then wipe

53
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:21,920
dry with a fresh paper

54
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:21,919
towel and I've got those right

55
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:30,318
here so my scissors are now ready to

56
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:32,679
go the next step that they want you to

57
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:35,000
do is to fill out this form so I'm going

58
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:37,959
to write the name of this sample in this

59
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,439
case it's uh Gary pton crossed with

60
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:45,878
animal mints so I'm just going to put

61
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:47,560
GPX am M and then I'm going to take my

62
00:02:45,878 --> 00:02:51,239
barcode

63
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,319
here and I'm going to stick it right on

64
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:54,878
the

65
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:58,199
form like that and then I'm going to

66
00:02:54,878 --> 00:03:00,280
take the corresponding barcode so

67
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:02,119
0157 and I'm going to stick it on the

68
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,199
plant that I'm sampling today so I could

69
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,799
stick this on a pot stick or you can

70
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:09,759
stick it right on the fabric pot

71
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:12,239
here right like that so now that I've

72
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:14,399
done all of those steps the next step is

73
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:17,560
to put on your disposable gloves or you

74
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,560
can already have them on and um spray

75
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,318
your gloves really quickly with a little

76
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,479
bit of bleach solution 10% bleach and

77
00:03:21,318 --> 00:03:24,479
I'm going to do it away from my

78
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:32,318
plants rub it all around make

79
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:32,318
sure my hands are

80
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:39,280
clean and then the next step is to take

81
00:03:36,438 --> 00:03:41,959
my sample now for the sample

82
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:45,000
here you need your sample length to be

83
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:47,640
less than a/ quar inch so not very long

84
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,120
you want to get lateral Roots so we're

85
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:51,359
talking you know this is a quarter inch

86
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,680
here um the whole sample that's going

87
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,560
into the vial tube needs to be less than

88
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,799
a full inch so that's the important part

89
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,759
of this process so now I'm going to go

90
00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:04,438
over here and take my sample so I'm

91
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:08,919
going to gently peel back the

92
00:04:04,438 --> 00:04:08,919
soil to expose these lateral

93
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:16,720
roots and I'm going to take some from a

94
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,120
few different

95
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,120
spots in the

96
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:32,639
pot and I'm going to have to cut some of

97
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,639
these down because they're just too

98
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:37,680
long okay so now that I have my samples

99
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:39,159
and I've cut them down to the

100
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:44,120
appropriate

101
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:47,639
size less than a quter inch per sample

102
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:49,879
uh per route and then total sample size

103
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:52,360
of all the roots is less than an inch

104
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:56,360
I'm putting all of them into the sample

105
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:58,439
vial and then they recommend U moving it

106
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:01,520
up and down like that and then turning

107
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:03,759
it like 10 to 20 times just to make sure

108
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:05,918
that the roots are fully coated with the

109
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,879
sample solution in there that will help

110
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:11,758
stabilize it for the trip to the lab and

111
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:15,519
then I'm putting on the barcode that

112
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:17,000
goes with that particular sample and I'm

113
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:19,198
trying to figure out the best way to do

114
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,478
that here so I decided to put it on like

115
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,199
this and so that will allow the lab to

116
00:05:21,478 --> 00:05:26,159
match that particular root sample with

117
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:29,879
that particular plant that I pulled the

118
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:32,240
sample from so I'm going to record that

119
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:33,759
on the sample sheet and then I'm going

120
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,400
to get that directly into the

121
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:40,879
refrigerator for 24 hours to let it cool

122
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:43,159
and then taking that and sending it to

123
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:46,478
the post office uh filling it out with

124
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:50,639
the address on the sheet and getting

125
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:53,399
that to the lab right

126
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,160
away and that's it this is really the

127
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:58,038
best and frankly the only way to find

128
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,680
out if your plants have pop and vroid

129
00:05:58,038 --> 00:06:00,680
and it's really important to know what

130
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,800
what you're dealing with when we're

131
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:06,038
talking about pathogens so you can treat

132
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,038
it directly
