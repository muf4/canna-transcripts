cutting edge of growing from a

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,679
science-based perspective and drawn top

8
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:27,959

down kiss farm our seven acre farm and

15
00:00:37,409 --> 00:00:41,099
feed store due to issues with the county

16
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:42,989
around permitting but it's also been an

17
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,600
impetus to refocus our energy around

18
00:00:42,988 --> 00:00:48,299
kiss organics soil science and research

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,579
in cannabis I recently brought dr. Ben

24
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,489
expanding our in-house research through

25
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,840
his connection with gold leaf and

26
00:00:59,488 --> 00:01:03,570
ability to monitor and set up

27
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,280
experiments in addition I had double

28
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,560
knee surgery a couple weeks ago and I'm

29
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,359
slowly getting back up to speed with our

00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,129
first child arriving here any day now

31

38
00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:27,329
cannabis production Dr Kaplan has

39
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,890

propagation so that's what's going on

44
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:40,170
over here at KISS organics we do plan on

45

show yeah can we start off giving

82
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:00,030
listeners a little bit of an

83
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:04,860
introduction to your background in the

84
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:07,979
certification world absolutely yeah so

85
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:12,870
I've been I've been involved doing

86
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:15,389
organic certification work since 2005 he

87
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:19,319
started working as a full-time organic

88
00:03:15,389 --> 00:03:24,708
inspector for oregon pihl's which is one

89
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:28,289
of the nation's oldest and largest

90
00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:32,580
organic certifiers of farms and dairies

91
00:03:28,289 --> 00:03:35,099
food processors and so I got involved

92
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:38,010
and during that time when I was an

93
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:40,349
inspector I visited hundreds of

94
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:46,889
different organic farms throughout

95
00:03:40,349 --> 00:03:49,289
Oregon Washington California and we had

96
00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:52,909
clients over in the Midwest and also

97
00:03:49,289 --> 00:03:56,909
speak Spanish so I get sent to Mexico

98
00:03:52,909 --> 00:04:01,769
for six to seven weeks a year and look

99
00:03:56,909 --> 00:04:03,359
at the farms down in Mexico and so all

100
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:06,840
that work you know it was very

101
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:10,170
interesting to see farming organic

102
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:13,560
farming at different scales so I started

103
00:04:10,169 --> 00:04:15,708
to do that work and then I got involved

104
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:19,939
behind the scenes that were again self

105
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:22,199
helping to make certification decisions

106
00:04:19,939 --> 00:04:23,969
you know to approve an organic

107
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:25,469
certificate or to deny it

108
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:27,780
spend it relocate whatever needed to

109
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:30,120
happen and also

110
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:37,469
I started managing the latin-american

111
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:40,680
program that we had and so yeah that was

112
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:43,440
it's been a great way to actually get a

113
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:47,400
deep dive into organic agriculture and

114
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:49,250
food processing yeah now I met you boy I

115
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:51,599
don't even know how many years ago now

116
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:55,459
I'm gonna guess five or six years ago

117
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:58,350
through Jaya Palmer he introduced us and

118
00:04:55,459 --> 00:05:00,419
that was sort of my first foray into

119
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:01,410
learning about certification

120
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:03,629
you've taught you've set up a

121
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:04,860
certification called certified kind for

122
00:05:03,629 --> 00:05:07,110
the cannabis industry and we're gonna

123
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:10,620
definitely talk about that quite a bit

124
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:15,030
but what I guess what made you

125
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:17,670
interested in setting up a certification

126
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:19,859
in the first first place and what are

127
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:25,199
some of the challenges around that that

128
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:28,259
go into that process yeah well you know

129
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:31,918
the idea for doing like a cannabis

130
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:36,209
organic certification a lot you know

131
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:38,250
that goes back pretty far a couple of my

132
00:05:36,209 --> 00:05:40,289
colleagues that were gonna Tilton I you

133
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:43,350
know had talked about the need for it

134
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:47,610
with in Oregon specifically and then

135
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:50,520
once they once Oregon started allowing

136
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:52,229
medical dispensaries and for like the

137
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:55,589
retail sale of cannabis and Medical

138
00:05:52,228 --> 00:05:58,279
dispensaries that's when it became clear

139
00:05:55,589 --> 00:06:00,599
that we needed to have some sort of

140
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:04,019
certification program or oversight

141
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:06,930
because people everybody was calling

142
00:06:04,019 --> 00:06:11,120
their cannabis organic and folks like me

143
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:14,340
who care about organic agriculture and

144
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,590
you know have had organic farms and

145
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:21,000
certifications and also work to do

146
00:06:16,589 --> 00:06:25,529
inspection work what not seeing cannabis

147
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:28,860
market is organic was when we knew that

148
00:06:25,529 --> 00:06:31,529
most of it wasn't that was the

149
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:35,550
motivation to start certified time we

150
00:06:31,529 --> 00:06:41,278
wanted to put truth in organic cannabis

151
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:44,338
labeling and so that's what we did

152
00:06:41,278 --> 00:06:48,149
and you know the heart the heart parts

153
00:06:44,338 --> 00:06:51,449
of doing a certification well everybody

154
00:06:48,149 --> 00:06:52,918
thinks it's like easy to set up a

155
00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:54,869
certification program throughout the

156
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:57,538
years have been approached a number of

157
00:06:54,869 --> 00:06:59,939
times by other people saying a we want

158
00:06:57,538 --> 00:07:02,009
to we want to set up we want to do an

159
00:06:59,939 --> 00:07:03,119
organic certification or oh you know

160
00:07:02,009 --> 00:07:05,269
we're not going to get your

161
00:07:03,119 --> 00:07:09,509
certification maybe we'll start our own

162
00:07:05,269 --> 00:07:13,168
and I kind of always laugh at that

163
00:07:09,509 --> 00:07:14,639
because the if you're trying to do a

164
00:07:13,168 --> 00:07:19,198
professional third-party certification

165
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:22,228
you really have to have the systems in

166
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:24,569
place to be able to receive new

167
00:07:22,228 --> 00:07:27,389
applicants and you have to have the

168
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:30,239
experience to be able to evaluate the

169
00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:32,549
farm plans that they put together and

170
00:07:30,238 --> 00:07:34,438
talk to them at a really high level

171
00:07:32,548 --> 00:07:37,168
about what they're doing their farming

172
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:39,539
practices and not only that but you've

173
00:07:37,168 --> 00:07:43,378
got to manage all this information that

174
00:07:39,538 --> 00:07:45,628
you collect that you're using to audit

175
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:48,899
them and and hold their feet to the fire

176
00:07:45,629 --> 00:07:50,939
you know when it comes to doing what

177
00:07:48,899 --> 00:07:54,478
they say they're doing and ensuring that

178
00:07:50,939 --> 00:07:59,569
they're actually farming organically so

179
00:07:54,478 --> 00:08:05,308
I think there's a lot of moving parts to

180
00:07:59,569 --> 00:08:08,309
third-party certification and you know

181
00:08:05,309 --> 00:08:10,619
the best part for me is getting out on

182
00:08:08,309 --> 00:08:14,249
the farm and seeing what people are

183
00:08:10,619 --> 00:08:16,789
doing so there's a few challenges here

184
00:08:14,249 --> 00:08:20,099
if I'm hearing you correctly one is

185
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:22,528
setting up the the rules and regulations

186
00:08:20,098 --> 00:08:24,269
around a certification because the term

187
00:08:22,528 --> 00:08:29,928
organic and cannabis is meaningless

188
00:08:24,269 --> 00:08:31,949
because there is there is no unifying

189
00:08:29,928 --> 00:08:34,068
certification that everyone turns to

190
00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:38,579
like if we look at the AG model you have

191
00:08:34,068 --> 00:08:40,198
or you know our foods model we have you

192
00:08:38,578 --> 00:08:41,968
know the NOP the National Organic

193
00:08:40,198 --> 00:08:45,208
Program that sets standards that then

194
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:47,879
different states will have certifying

195
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:50,549
programs to match those standards more

196
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:53,490
or less and then you also have Omri

197
00:08:50,549 --> 00:08:55,289
which is a third party certifier

198
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:57,769
can you just touch really briefly on

199
00:08:55,289 --> 00:09:02,610
what that what that model looks like

200
00:08:57,769 --> 00:09:06,360
sure so in the United States we have the

201
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:12,060
USDA Organic Program and that's actually

202
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:15,330
housed under the USDA agricultural

203
00:09:12,059 --> 00:09:19,099
marketing service and so the National

204
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:23,930
Organic Program what you mentioned is

205
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:27,560
responsible for sort of maintaining and

206
00:09:23,929 --> 00:09:32,459
curating the National Organic Program

207
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:38,909
standards and then that standard is used

208
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:41,970
by like accredited agencies so the USDA

209
00:09:38,909 --> 00:09:46,620
will accredit third parties to act on

210
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:51,710
their behalf to administer certification

211
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:55,139
program so there are 54 around 54 55

212
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:57,180
USDA Organic accredited certifiers

213
00:09:55,139 --> 00:10:00,419
within the United States and there's

214
00:09:57,179 --> 00:10:04,139
about 50 outside the United States and

215
00:10:00,419 --> 00:10:06,000
so um the work of like getting an

216
00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:08,519
organic certification and USDA Organic

217
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,490
certification for your farm your dairy

218
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:14,519
your food processing facility that's

219
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:15,960
done by these third parties and so um

220
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:18,149
one of those third parties already

221
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:20,370
mentioned was Oregon tilt but there are

222
00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:25,039
others that people might know about like

223
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:27,509
qai or CCO F that stands for certified

224
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:33,209
California certified organic farmers on

225
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:37,470
the East Coast there's private

226
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:45,259
certifiers like New York organic farmers

227
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:49,410
association etc etc so Omri is actually

228
00:10:45,259 --> 00:10:52,740
only specializes in material review so

229
00:10:49,409 --> 00:10:55,019
these 54 accredited certifiers they they

230
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:57,180
specialize and actually certifying that

231
00:10:55,019 --> 00:11:01,139
a business meets the USDA Organic

232
00:10:57,179 --> 00:11:04,349
regulations and Omri specializes in

233
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:07,169
reviewing materials such as fertilizers

234
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:10,259
and pesticides for

235
00:11:07,169 --> 00:11:18,049
clients to the USDA Organic regulation

236
00:11:10,259 --> 00:11:20,990
so Omri is a special beast and there are

237
00:11:18,049 --> 00:11:24,059
there are a couple other army like

238
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:26,039
institutions one of them is rum it's

239
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:28,229
called the double USDA Washington State

240
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:30,778
Department of Agriculture organic

241
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:32,759
material review program the other one is

242
00:11:30,778 --> 00:11:35,578
a California Department of Food and

243
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:39,809
Agriculture z-- organic input materials

244
00:11:35,578 --> 00:11:42,208
program the CD FAO I am and they only

245
00:11:39,809 --> 00:11:48,479
work with fertilizers by the way so

246
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:51,419
those those three entities will do a

247
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,930
material review and approve it for

248
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:56,250
organics or not and then those 54 other

249
00:11:53,929 --> 00:11:59,039
organic certifiers that work with funds

250
00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:02,159
and food processors will respect the

251
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:07,349
decision of Omri double USDA Organic or

252
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:10,559
CDF a oh I am and allow farmers to use

253
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:12,028
those material that's that's actually

254
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:15,299
really helpful I didn't totally

255
00:12:12,028 --> 00:12:17,970
understand that in my head exactly so so

256
00:12:15,299 --> 00:12:20,338
hearing it is really useful and I know

257
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:23,850
like you were actually we hired you at

258
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:25,199
one point to help us navigate you know

259
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:29,009
with Oregon tilth

260
00:12:25,198 --> 00:12:31,859
and with the Washington State Department

261
00:12:29,009 --> 00:12:35,009
of Agriculture and then finally we just

262
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:37,919
recently got our CDFA approval for

263
00:12:35,009 --> 00:12:41,039
organic materials so on the fertilizer

264
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:43,229
or soil side and we register our soil as

265
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:45,179
a fertilizer because technically

266
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:47,789
anything that helps make a plant grow

267
00:12:45,179 --> 00:12:50,609
they call a fertilizer and it has an NPK

268
00:12:47,789 --> 00:12:54,028
value so it's it's a little more

269
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:55,440
convoluted on my end but having those

270
00:12:54,028 --> 00:12:57,720
certifications I think is really

271
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:01,640
powerful because it shows that my

272
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:04,589
product is regulated it's tested and

273
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:06,269
there's someone there's third parties

274
00:13:04,589 --> 00:13:08,940
that are determining the quality of it

275
00:13:06,269 --> 00:13:10,889
and I think that third party aspect is

276
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:12,449
really important that's something that

277
00:13:10,889 --> 00:13:16,230
that you mentioned that I want to just

278
00:13:12,448 --> 00:13:19,169
touch on if for example is kiss organics

279
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:20,289
I made a certification around it and

280
00:13:19,169 --> 00:13:22,929
called it you know the kid

281
00:13:20,289 --> 00:13:25,899
organic certification and you used my

282
00:13:22,929 --> 00:13:28,109
products I don't feel that certification

283
00:13:25,899 --> 00:13:31,028
would carry the same weight as if

284
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:33,009
someone unaffiliated with my company

285
00:13:31,028 --> 00:13:35,169
created a certification like you know

286
00:13:33,009 --> 00:13:36,100
like certified kind I think that's

287
00:13:35,169 --> 00:13:38,110
that's a much more powerful

288
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:41,199
certification because it's not linked to

289
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:43,000
any products or another company and

290
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:45,639
that's that's something to consider when

291
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,528
we talk about certifications as well but

292
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:49,448
let's uh let's dive into certified kind

293
00:13:47,528 --> 00:13:51,519
a little bit so when you set up

294
00:13:49,448 --> 00:13:53,708
certified kind you were looking to

295
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:59,220
establish a certification that would be

296
00:13:53,708 --> 00:14:02,049
as rigorous as these standards on the

297
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:04,079
agricultural side as well correct when

298
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:08,409
we talk about material review and and

299
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:09,969
farms that would qualify and such yeah

300
00:14:08,409 --> 00:14:13,480
exactly

301
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:16,449
the goal of certified kind was to offer

302
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:19,329
a professional third-party certification

303
00:14:16,448 --> 00:14:24,609
for cannabis growers medical or adult

304
00:14:19,328 --> 00:14:29,109
youth that were licensed I'm permitted

305
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:32,589
in their state to grow so essentially

306
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:36,759
what we were trying to do is to create a

307
00:14:32,589 --> 00:14:38,740
program that was very similar to how

308
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:40,990
folks get certified on their youth on

309
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:43,870
their organic farms how they get USDA

310
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:46,750
Organic certification there were a

311
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:49,600
couple reasons first of all we wanted

312
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:52,000
foot we want folks to get the

313
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,909
certification and instead of using the

314
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,980
term organic to market their product we

315
00:14:54,909 --> 00:14:59,799
wanted them to use kind or certified

316
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:01,539
kind so we we didn't want them using the

317
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:04,629
term organic to market their cannabis

318
00:15:01,539 --> 00:15:08,169
because that's a regulated marketing

319
00:15:04,629 --> 00:15:11,679
term and it introduces confusion into

320
00:15:08,169 --> 00:15:14,019
the marketplace if people are saying hey

321
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:15,879
Dazz we is organic but there's no

322
00:15:14,019 --> 00:15:18,399
third-party certification or

323
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:20,198
verification system in place so certify

324
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:23,679
kind serves that purpose you know it's

325
00:15:20,198 --> 00:15:26,919
to verify that farms that work with us

326
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:29,859
get certified or actually only using

327
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:33,778
organic approved fertilizers and

328
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:33,778
pesticides etc right

329
00:15:34,179 --> 00:15:41,049
and you know for it's interesting

330
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:46,149
because you mentioned the kiss kiss

331
00:15:41,049 --> 00:15:49,049
organic soils and yeah what I found

332
00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:52,090
through working with a lot of materials

333
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:55,599
manufacturers is that not all the

334
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:58,420
ingredients listed on a fertilizer or on

335
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,220
the pesticide not all the ingredients

336
00:15:58,419 --> 00:16:04,179
they're actually in the product are

337
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:06,450
listed on the label and so and that's

338
00:16:04,179 --> 00:16:09,879
Kanan what happens when you go through

339
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:13,780
this Omri certification or a good

340
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:16,299
third-party material review is that they

341
00:16:13,779 --> 00:16:19,000
ask for detailed information about the

342
00:16:16,299 --> 00:16:20,409
ingredients to verify that the

343
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,629
ingredients that are listed on the label

344
00:16:20,409 --> 00:16:26,469
and also the ones that aren't are

345
00:16:22,629 --> 00:16:28,509
allowed in organic farming yeah it's

346
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:30,879
it's crazy how strict they are I beat

347
00:16:28,509 --> 00:16:33,939
the CDFA I was hung up for six months

348
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:36,580
because our source of neem they sprayed

349
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:39,130
a small amount we're talking very very

350
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:42,790
small amount of molasses on the product

351
00:16:39,129 --> 00:16:44,679
during the production in India and

352
00:16:42,789 --> 00:16:47,349
because I couldn't get in the

353
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:49,029
manufacturer in India because I was

354
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:51,670
buying it through a couple third parties

355
00:16:49,029 --> 00:16:55,449
by the time I got to me too he was they

356
00:16:51,669 --> 00:16:58,360
weren't willing to list their source for

357
00:16:55,450 --> 00:17:00,460
the molasses the entire product failed

358
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:02,009
so I had to find another neem source

359
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:05,799
where I could get the entire process

360
00:17:02,009 --> 00:17:08,829
laid out which made CDFA a lot harder

361
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:12,509
than some of the other material review

362
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:17,500
certifications yeah yeah it's amazing

363
00:17:12,509 --> 00:17:21,309
how detailed people get when there's

364
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:23,440
like a standard involved and it becomes

365
00:17:21,309 --> 00:17:25,869
a lot of people it becomes very you know

366
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:27,700
black and white oh they ask you about

367
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:29,439
the neem you tell them all they spray

368
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:31,750
molest on it and now all the sudden you

369
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,509
have to track down you know where did

370
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:37,390
that molasses come from and so that's

371
00:17:34,509 --> 00:17:42,190
why you know when people say when they

372
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:45,880
complain about Omri you know to me or

373
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:47,920
CDFA they they're complaining about all

374
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:50,610
me not being rigorous and

375
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:53,740
or whatever that's a bunch of BS

376
00:17:50,609 --> 00:17:55,689
armories armory in the CDFA are very

377
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:59,470
rigorous when it comes to material

378
00:17:55,690 --> 00:18:01,840
review see I wasn't aware that army was

379
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:04,089
as that strict I didn't go down the army

380
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:06,129
route because they take as a third party

381
00:18:04,089 --> 00:18:09,179
certifier part of their business models

382
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:13,240
they take a portion of your profits as

383
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:15,820
payment for the seal so I chose to go

384
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:17,890
with the CDFA and the double USDA for my

385
00:18:15,819 --> 00:18:19,419
certification but one of the things I

386
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:21,370
learned from you is that armory if you

387
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:23,620
see that armory certification on a

388
00:18:21,369 --> 00:18:26,289
product it means that the products been

389
00:18:23,619 --> 00:18:28,929
legitimately certified and you can trust

390
00:18:26,289 --> 00:18:30,250
that symbol which I think it's so the

391
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:32,259
good thing about armory I think this is

392
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:33,849
something we should talk about so a good

393
00:18:32,259 --> 00:18:36,039
thing about armory is consumers

394
00:18:33,849 --> 00:18:37,779
recognize and know it growers see that

395
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:39,759
label and they go okay it's Omri

396
00:18:37,779 --> 00:18:42,250
certified and that means that has value

397
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:44,259
because they've captured a certain

398
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:46,690
portion of the market and you know

399
00:18:44,259 --> 00:18:48,279
Washington State and California have

400
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:50,410
that same power I think because they're

401
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:52,569
a state regulatory body people see that

402
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:55,990
as having value too but in the cannabis

403
00:18:52,569 --> 00:18:58,629
industry right we need we need a

404
00:18:55,990 --> 00:19:01,420
unifying certification you know one

405
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:02,920
where and my hope you know frankly I may

406
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:05,289
be fairly transparent about it my hope

407
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:07,240
is that certified kind and ones like Sun

408
00:19:05,289 --> 00:19:10,089
and Earth can be those certifications

409
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:12,700
for our industry because I know you and

410
00:19:10,089 --> 00:19:15,189
I know what this the value of the

411
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:17,080
certification is because the challenge

412
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:18,730
there is one you have to have good

413
00:19:17,079 --> 00:19:19,929
standards so you have to have someone

414
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:21,640
that runs it that understands what

415
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:23,049
standards should be and so you have to

416
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,250
have the right standards and then you

417
00:19:23,049 --> 00:19:26,529
have to have the right level of

418
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:28,960
regulation and that costs money and you

419
00:19:26,529 --> 00:19:30,519
know farm visits cost money but we need

420
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,620
them to happen so that we can guarantee

421
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:33,759
that what people are saying they're

422
00:19:32,619 --> 00:19:37,179
doing on their farm they're they're

423
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:38,559
actually doing but can you just I know I

424
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:40,720
kind of rambled there but can you talk a

425
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:42,789
little bit about that sort of that idea

426
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:46,990
of needing a unifying certification and

427
00:19:42,789 --> 00:19:51,599
the value of it yeah sure so you know

428
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:54,400
and then if food in the food industry

429
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:56,619
you know the gold standard right now for

430
00:19:54,400 --> 00:20:00,490
a third-party certification is USDA

431
00:19:56,619 --> 00:20:01,779
Organic and in cannabis it would be

432
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:07,059
really nice if the

433
00:20:01,779 --> 00:20:09,879
sumer could look to just certification

434
00:20:07,059 --> 00:20:12,490
label and say okay it's been it's been

435
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:16,180
certified by for instance certified kind

436
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:17,950
we trust these guys we we look we know

437
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:20,590
that they do a professional third party

438
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:24,190
inspection and certification all the way

439
00:20:20,589 --> 00:20:27,879
through and that would be really nice

440
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:31,809
rate to be able to have something as

441
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:34,840
powerful as a USDA Organic that symbol

442
00:20:31,809 --> 00:20:36,429
so for folks that care about these

443
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:39,159
things they could walk into a dispensary

444
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:42,039
ask full ask for hey which products are

445
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:43,150
certified and the bud tenders would be

446
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:46,509
able to point them in the right

447
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:48,190
direction you know I think it'd be I

448
00:20:46,509 --> 00:20:50,259
think it's interesting I think we should

449
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:54,130
talk a little bit about what does a

450
00:20:50,259 --> 00:20:56,319
certified kind farm look like yeah I

451
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:58,480
think that's a good idea right before we

452
00:20:56,319 --> 00:21:01,809
do I just want to add one last thought

453
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:05,890
to your your latest comment and I think

454
00:21:01,809 --> 00:21:09,039
as a consumer walking into dispensary is

455
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:11,080
a great example so there are consumers I

456
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:13,059
mean a lot of them I'm sure that listen

457
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:14,799
to this podcast when they look at

458
00:21:13,059 --> 00:21:17,349
products that they're not growing they

459
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:20,440
want to know that they were grown safely

460
00:21:17,349 --> 00:21:24,219
and in a manner that don't want don't

461
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:26,140
want to consume and so when I walk in if

462
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:28,259
I see all these different certifications

463
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:30,910
I may not know what each certification

464
00:21:28,259 --> 00:21:33,759
stands for and what their standards are

465
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:36,850
and what the value of that seal is on a

466
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:40,329
given package so it's it's a process of

467
00:21:36,849 --> 00:21:42,099
educating consumers and having enough

468
00:21:40,329 --> 00:21:43,750
marketing and to get out there that the

469
00:21:42,099 --> 00:21:46,179
people know what it is and then also

470
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:48,309
understanding the value of it too you

471
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:50,320
know creating a certification and

472
00:21:48,309 --> 00:21:53,289
putting a sticker only has value if

473
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:55,179
that's backed by something like you said

474
00:21:53,289 --> 00:21:57,909
in some some level of regulation and

475
00:21:55,180 --> 00:22:00,820
expertise so yeah let's talk about what

476
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:05,830
what a certified kind farm actually

477
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:10,269
looks like right so so just as in

478
00:22:05,829 --> 00:22:12,779
organic farming you know the the amount

479
00:22:10,269 --> 00:22:15,309
of commitment and dedication to like

480
00:22:12,779 --> 00:22:19,500
organic regenitive

481
00:22:15,309 --> 00:22:22,589
farming practice rent it's a range so

482
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:24,970
but there are certain things that are

483
00:22:22,589 --> 00:22:28,629
characteristic of a certified time farm

484
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:31,029
so let's talk for a second about the

485
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:34,600
outdoor farms and then we can sort of

486
00:22:31,029 --> 00:22:37,389
talk about the indoor farms so for for

487
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:42,399
an outdoor farm what we're looking for

488
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:46,120
is first of all farm that's only using

489
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:48,910
organic approved fertility so that soil

490
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:53,829
amendments organic approved potting soil

491
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:57,400
and organic approved pest control

492
00:22:53,829 --> 00:23:01,119
materials so that's that's the first

493
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:04,030
criteria so we actually kind of have to

494
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:07,289
deny a lot of certification requests

495
00:23:04,029 --> 00:23:10,259
because a lot of folks are using

496
00:23:07,289 --> 00:23:13,059
synthetic liquid fertilizers or

497
00:23:10,259 --> 00:23:19,720
synthetic powders that they fertig ate

498
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:21,519
in and so that type of farming is not it

499
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:24,450
that's not for certified kind we don't

500
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:28,389
work with conventional non-organic firms

501
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:31,360
a lot of our farms are doing things like

502
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:34,509
using cover crops for instance you can

503
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:37,659
use daikon radishes to as a cover crop

504
00:23:34,509 --> 00:23:40,890
in the fall and in the spring winter and

505
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:44,800
spring and that really can help to

506
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:49,000
penetrate soils that have been hardpan

507
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:52,139
due to cultivation and rototilling right

508
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,759
and then when they decay you know you're

509
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:57,100
creating space and habitat for a lot of

510
00:23:54,759 --> 00:23:59,859
microorganisms and natural nutrient

511
00:23:57,099 --> 00:24:01,539
cycling so on these on these farms

512
00:23:59,859 --> 00:24:03,939
there's a lot of natural nutrient

513
00:24:01,539 --> 00:24:08,109
cycling going on now the interesting

514
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:10,840
thing with some with certified kind we

515
00:24:08,109 --> 00:24:14,199
we include indoor growers in our

516
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:16,689
certification and we hold them to the

517
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:18,160
certified kind standard for the parts of

518
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:22,240
the standard that are applicable to an

519
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:24,040
indoor grow and what I've been seeing a

520
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:28,539
lot of and of course you're aware of it

521
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:33,039
sowing the kiss soil is that the trend

522
00:24:28,539 --> 00:24:35,740
an organic indoor car is more raised

523
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:38,950
beds and natural nutrient cycling within

524
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:42,099
those beds which is pretty interesting

525
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:47,200
and unique what I'm talking about course

526
00:24:42,099 --> 00:24:48,569
is like your no-till soil I think I

527
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,309
don't know that it's not really the

528
00:24:48,569 --> 00:24:55,019
probably the right terminology to use in

529
00:24:51,309 --> 00:24:58,569
a pure agricultural horticultural sense

530
00:24:55,019 --> 00:25:01,809
but it's these are these are soils that

531
00:24:58,569 --> 00:25:04,089
where you're planting cannabis cycle

532
00:25:01,809 --> 00:25:05,440
after cycle the only thing that's really

533
00:25:04,089 --> 00:25:07,539
happening there is you're cutting the

534
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:10,870
stock cutting the plant out of the of

535
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:14,740
the bed and you know we see folks

536
00:25:10,869 --> 00:25:16,419
reinventing the soil but the interesting

537
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:19,210
thing is that in that indoor setting

538
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:21,759
where you have the perfect temperature

539
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:24,460
and humidity you see nutrients like

540
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:26,470
natural nutrient cycling that's off the

541
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:30,009
hook fast right

542
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:32,500
so somebody somebody croats comfrey and

543
00:25:30,009 --> 00:25:35,650
does a chop and drop in an indoor crow

544
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:40,170
and it's gone really quickly what's

545
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:45,330
happening there well there's you know

546
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:47,529
microbiology is taking over so anyway

547
00:25:45,329 --> 00:25:50,949
that's a really fascinating thing about

548
00:25:47,529 --> 00:25:54,250
the indoor growth and we're seeing a lot

549
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:56,559
of that yeah what were some of the

550
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:59,619
challenges with indoor grows I know I

551
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:01,000
was talking with Nate over in gold leaf

552
00:25:59,619 --> 00:26:03,939
recently and he said one of the things

553
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:07,000
that ws ta was stuck on our challenge

554
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:08,650
with was how do they regulate co2 being

555
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,420
brought in and some of the methods for

556
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:13,360
which that happens in an indoor

557
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:15,519
operation and qualifying those things

558
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:18,219
for organic standards what are some of

559
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:20,379
the other challenges with indoors versus

560
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:25,620
outdoor from an organic certification

561
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:29,430
perspective okay fer for certifier that

562
00:26:25,619 --> 00:26:32,559
working with USDA Organic regulations

563
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:36,430
it's there are a lot of obstacles to

564
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:40,720
certifying cannabis and so one of them

565
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:42,278
would be you know do we allow co2 so

566
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,618
you're in like it

567
00:26:42,278 --> 00:26:49,778
door space where you're you're trying to

568
00:26:44,618 --> 00:26:52,089
add co2 and this isn't really done in

569
00:26:49,778 --> 00:26:55,589
any other type of crop there's no

570
00:26:52,089 --> 00:26:59,468
there's really aren't a lot of indoor

571
00:26:55,589 --> 00:27:01,089
organic vegetables being grown and

572
00:26:59,469 --> 00:27:08,469
they're not pumping the facility fro

573
00:27:01,089 --> 00:27:10,778
full of co2 so carbon dioxide is not

574
00:27:08,469 --> 00:27:12,219
first all first of all they have to

575
00:27:10,778 --> 00:27:16,388
determine if it's synthetic or

576
00:27:12,219 --> 00:27:19,659
non-synthetic now carbon dioxide is it

577
00:27:16,388 --> 00:27:23,788
comes in a you know maybe that's why

578
00:27:19,659 --> 00:27:26,109
there's some hesitation just to allow it

579
00:27:23,788 --> 00:27:29,169
they probably are saying that that

580
00:27:26,108 --> 00:27:31,298
synthetic and that it's synthetic co2 is

581
00:27:29,169 --> 00:27:35,830
not listed as a farm production aid in

582
00:27:31,298 --> 00:27:39,249
the National Organic Standards so you

583
00:27:35,829 --> 00:27:41,588
run into roadblocks like that with some

584
00:27:39,249 --> 00:27:46,118
of the practices that are common in

585
00:27:41,588 --> 00:27:49,178
cannabis so with Kinnick in a farm you

586
00:27:46,118 --> 00:27:53,259
co2 supplementation with your current

587
00:27:49,179 --> 00:27:54,759
standard was with certified kind that is

588
00:27:53,259 --> 00:27:57,429
a really good question

589
00:27:54,759 --> 00:27:59,798
I currently I don't think we we have

590
00:27:57,429 --> 00:28:05,320
anyone that's doing co2 supplementation

591
00:27:59,798 --> 00:28:10,960
at all and if we looked at the standard

592
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:14,079
itself we'd probably find that co2 isn't

593
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:16,028
listed but I'll tell you what I can

594
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:17,648
check and maybe get back to you on it

595
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:20,798
because it's not one that I was just

596
00:28:17,648 --> 00:28:22,569
ready to hook up yeah I didn't put you

597
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:24,819
on the spot I'm surprised I hasn't come

598
00:28:22,569 --> 00:28:26,319
up yet because I think any a lot of the

599
00:28:24,819 --> 00:28:29,700
not a knee but a lot of the commercial

600
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:33,729
facilities would want to supplement co2

601
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:35,528
in order to maximize yield just based on

602
00:28:33,729 --> 00:28:38,798
the research out there around lighting

603
00:28:35,528 --> 00:28:40,239
and in co2 supplementation so I'm

604
00:28:38,798 --> 00:28:42,278
surprised you haven't encountered that

605
00:28:40,239 --> 00:28:44,259
yet but I I know that there are these

606
00:28:42,278 --> 00:28:46,838
challenges associated with indoor

607
00:28:44,259 --> 00:28:49,808
environments that you know another one

608
00:28:46,838 --> 00:28:56,119
another one like that that I can speak

609
00:28:49,808 --> 00:28:58,579
to is sulfur burning sulfur so in

610
00:28:56,119 --> 00:29:01,509
indoor facility or a you know greenhouse

611
00:28:58,579 --> 00:29:06,399
and enclosed space people have been

612
00:29:01,509 --> 00:29:10,460
burning sulfur or vaporizing sulfur -

613
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:13,670
it's a great way to control fungus and

614
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:18,500
and also like him brush at night broad

615
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:21,110
nights but burning sulfur is not

616
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:23,599
something that's allowed in organic

617
00:29:21,109 --> 00:29:26,949
agriculture you can use micronized

618
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:31,490
sulfur but you can't burn sulfur so

619
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:34,910
there's another spot there where so or

620
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:38,890
you know organic rules don't really save

621
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:42,110
her some of these cultural you know

622
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:42,850
practices that cannabis growers use

623
00:29:42,109 --> 00:29:47,659
indoors

624
00:29:42,849 --> 00:29:48,740
another one is potassium silicate which

625
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:52,759
I think you and I have talked about

626
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:54,440
before oh yeah but potassium silicate or

627
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:58,670
Axl

628
00:29:54,440 --> 00:30:02,480
a lot of girls like to use this in their

629
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:08,090
as a fruit as a fertilizer you know to

630
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:10,190
add to their potting soil and it helps

631
00:30:08,089 --> 00:30:13,159
strengthen the cell walls and create

632
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:17,779
probably a denser product that's less

633
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:21,650
susceptible to powdery mildew and yet

634
00:30:17,779 --> 00:30:25,879
using it that way is not allowed in us

635
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:28,340
the organic farming so the point here is

636
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:31,670
that these regulations that are in place

637
00:30:28,339 --> 00:30:33,919
for USDA Organic are not no one

638
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:35,600
considered cannabis production when they

639
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:38,210
were putting these rules together back

640
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:43,519
in when they were forming them back in

641
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:46,670
their late 1990s and early 2000s so so

642
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:49,160
it's going to be difficult for a state

643
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:52,460
you know the state or the federal

644
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:54,350
government to come in and try and offer

645
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:57,259
organic certification for cannabis

646
00:30:54,349 --> 00:31:02,599
without some tweaking of their own rules

647
00:30:57,259 --> 00:31:04,789
and so what we should look to right you

648
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:07,669
know if we want to understand how the US

649
00:31:04,789 --> 00:31:09,920
government will one day regulate an

650
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:11,900
offer organic certification we can look

651
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:13,400
- what's going on in Washington State

652
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:16,370
and also in California

653
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:18,490
both the Department of Agriculture's in

654
00:31:16,369 --> 00:31:23,269
those states are creating their own

655
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:26,779
certification programs for cannabis so

656
00:31:23,269 --> 00:31:30,230
on that note you mentioned like

657
00:31:26,779 --> 00:31:34,069
potassium silicate it is allowed for use

658
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:37,519
with as a spray a foliar spray for pests

659
00:31:34,069 --> 00:31:40,429
I believe is that correct yes you're

660
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:42,710
correct it's it's listed as allowed in

661
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:47,930
its aqueous form so aqueous potassium

662
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:51,920
silicate for pest control Disease

663
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:54,830
Control in the in the National USDA

664
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:59,180
Organic rules in the national list so a

665
00:31:54,829 --> 00:32:01,909
product like film matrix is an aqueous

666
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:05,269
solution it's been approved

667
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:07,700
Tom reproved that can be used but the

668
00:32:05,269 --> 00:32:11,289
other material made by the same company

669
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:14,950
he gets the same company called axle 16

670
00:32:11,289 --> 00:32:18,349
would probably get you in trouble with a

671
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:21,319
certification and we ask at certified

672
00:32:18,349 --> 00:32:23,059
time we ask people to stop using that so

673
00:32:21,319 --> 00:32:24,799
if you were or they have it's a

674
00:32:23,059 --> 00:32:26,359
concentrated powder when you receive it

675
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:28,490
but you're mixing it with water into a

676
00:32:26,359 --> 00:32:30,259
potassium silicon solution it's similar

677
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:32,630
to everything you find in the hydro shop

678
00:32:30,259 --> 00:32:34,549
at that point could you use the product

679
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:35,960
if you're not putting it in in its dry

680
00:32:34,549 --> 00:32:39,169
form because it's it's too highly

681
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:40,430
concentrated anyway to do so yeah

682
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:42,710
perhaps

683
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:44,990
I mean you would you would have to say

684
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:49,190
well I'm using this as a pest control

685
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:53,509
material in a Jake waste form and and

686
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:55,940
the thing is that in the production of

687
00:32:53,509 --> 00:33:01,670
USDA organic certified fruits and

688
00:32:55,940 --> 00:33:03,710
vegetables nobody's done that so so

689
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:06,860
we've never seen anybody try and make

690
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:09,079
the claim hey I'm using this potassium

691
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:11,479
silicate powder I'm adding it to water

692
00:33:09,079 --> 00:33:13,819
and I'm spraying it as a pest control

693
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:16,579
material I'm making my own fill matrix

694
00:33:13,819 --> 00:33:18,139
basically right that's that's kind of

695
00:33:16,579 --> 00:33:19,699
the argument you have to make and then

696
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:23,778
you would have and then the certifier

697
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:28,719
would have to receive that argument and

698
00:33:23,778 --> 00:33:32,569
and agree to it for you on your front

699
00:33:28,719 --> 00:33:34,308
but no but see the the current USA

700
00:33:32,569 --> 00:33:36,048
organic certifiers don't have any

701
00:33:34,308 --> 00:33:40,759
experience with canvas or cannabis

702
00:33:36,048 --> 00:33:44,239
growers so um probably they're going to

703
00:33:40,759 --> 00:33:46,669
just respond saying no you know because

704
00:33:44,239 --> 00:33:48,979
they don't understand the life cycle of

705
00:33:46,669 --> 00:33:52,059
cannabis or the specific pest pressures

706
00:33:48,979 --> 00:33:56,179
or what people want to use and what they

707
00:33:52,058 --> 00:33:58,960
they prefer and so they're gonna have a

708
00:33:56,179 --> 00:34:02,989
hard time fitting like you know around

709
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:04,519
well square peg in a round hole so so

710
00:34:02,989 --> 00:34:07,278
take me through the process here so if

711
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:11,358
I'm I'm a cultivator I'm a grower and I

712
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:14,809
wanted to consider certified kind or a

713
00:34:11,358 --> 00:34:17,179
certification agency for my farm or my

714
00:34:14,809 --> 00:34:19,519
growing operation what what's the

715
00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:24,260
process with you guys for that how's

716
00:34:19,519 --> 00:34:27,440
that occur well first of all we require

717
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:30,409
that the farm fill out one of our

718
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:36,230
applications and the application doubles

719
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:38,088
as their organic system plan so all

720
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:39,829
organic farms are supposed to have an

721
00:34:38,088 --> 00:34:42,288
organic system plan that sort of

722
00:34:39,829 --> 00:34:45,470
describes how they're farming how

723
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:48,919
they're compliant to the regulations and

724
00:34:45,469 --> 00:34:50,838
so for us we have a certified kind

725
00:34:48,918 --> 00:34:55,210
standard that you can download from our

726
00:34:50,838 --> 00:35:00,199
website certified certified kind calm

727
00:34:55,210 --> 00:35:03,380
and the application or the organic

728
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:07,098
system plan document it asks a series of

729
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:10,068
questions about your farm and that are

730
00:35:07,099 --> 00:35:13,010
applicable to the certification there's

731
00:35:10,068 --> 00:35:15,139
information that we need to know what we

732
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:17,210
do is once that filled out is we do a

733
00:35:15,139 --> 00:35:20,298
really thorough initial review and

734
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:23,599
that's a formal step where we evaluate

735
00:35:20,298 --> 00:35:26,389
the application and then we respond to

736
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:28,338
you saying you know hey these are the

737
00:35:26,389 --> 00:35:30,710
obstacles to certification you would

738
00:35:28,338 --> 00:35:34,730
have to change X Y and V if you wanted

739
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:37,139
to to be part of our certification or we

740
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:39,119
could say you know your farm plan

741
00:35:37,139 --> 00:35:42,239
looks excellent let's proceed to

742
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:46,318
scheduling the inspection so once we

743
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:48,679
receive a farm plan a farm organic

744
00:35:46,318 --> 00:35:51,119
system plan that is complete and

745
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:53,578
demonstrates compliance to our standards

746
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:56,400
then we schedule the on-site inspection

747
00:35:53,579 --> 00:36:01,890
at the on-site inspection we look at

748
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:04,619
every facet of cannabis production this

749
00:36:01,889 --> 00:36:07,920
on-site inspection that first time

750
00:36:04,619 --> 00:36:11,430
usually takes between I would say four

751
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:14,460
to five hours and at that time we're

752
00:36:11,429 --> 00:36:18,149
also with certified time we take a leaf

753
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:21,480
tissue sample and we'll send it to a lab

754
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:25,010
that tests it for pesticide residue of

755
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:28,260
over two hundred and forty metabolites

756
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:31,349
and so that's one way that we try and

757
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:34,289
put teeth into this program so that

758
00:36:31,349 --> 00:36:36,450
we're not only verifying through

759
00:36:34,289 --> 00:36:38,849
observations on-site that there are no

760
00:36:36,449 --> 00:36:41,548
pesticides at the facility or at the

761
00:36:38,849 --> 00:36:44,700
firm but we're but we're taking this

762
00:36:41,548 --> 00:36:47,518
tissue sample and testing it if they had

763
00:36:44,699 --> 00:36:50,960
applied anything for you know any

764
00:36:47,518 --> 00:36:54,058
pesticide over the last six months

765
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:55,909
or over the duration of the lifecycle of

766
00:36:54,059 --> 00:36:59,670
that plant we would catch it in our

767
00:36:55,909 --> 00:37:03,389
residue sampling so that's kind of an

768
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:06,389
extra step that a lot of sort of

769
00:37:03,389 --> 00:37:07,828
cannabis certifiers don't do I think

770
00:37:06,389 --> 00:37:11,098
we're the only one that takes a tissue

771
00:37:07,829 --> 00:37:12,240
sample like that oh yeah I'm expensive

772
00:37:11,099 --> 00:37:14,009
but I love it

773
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:15,989
I didn't realize a farm visit took that

774
00:37:14,009 --> 00:37:17,670
long I mean in my head I just I picture

775
00:37:15,989 --> 00:37:19,229
you kind of like walking around well I

776
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:21,380
don't see any advance nutrients on the

777
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:24,509
shelf I guess you guys are okay and then

778
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:27,509
you sign off that's really interesting

779
00:37:24,509 --> 00:37:29,190
that it takes it's that detailed and I

780
00:37:27,509 --> 00:37:31,079
love that you are taking that tissue

781
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:33,838
sample as verification I think that's

782
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:37,740
really a key component to all of this

783
00:37:33,838 --> 00:37:40,380
really being successful yeah it's been

784
00:37:37,739 --> 00:37:42,419
it's been interesting we haven't gotten

785
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:46,400
a positive result back on that lead

786
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:50,789
tissue samples in quite some time when

787
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:53,880
we first started we got a few paws

788
00:37:50,789 --> 00:37:59,309
test results from outdoor farms but it

789
00:37:53,880 --> 00:38:03,479
was such a minor concentration you know

790
00:37:59,309 --> 00:38:05,099
that we suspect it was from like

791
00:38:03,478 --> 00:38:09,328
neighboring drifts from a neighboring

792
00:38:05,099 --> 00:38:12,209
land use so plus I drift or the guy was

793
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:15,089
using some spray tanks that weren't that

794
00:38:12,208 --> 00:38:20,938
he had used in his landscaping business

795
00:38:15,088 --> 00:38:23,668
that weren't cleaned out properly so you

796
00:38:20,938 --> 00:38:26,219
know I don't know you know the rules for

797
00:38:23,668 --> 00:38:28,918
pesticide residues and different in

798
00:38:26,219 --> 00:38:34,409
different states are different like in

799
00:38:28,918 --> 00:38:39,150
in Oregon they test 459 residues we're

800
00:38:34,409 --> 00:38:41,159
testing for like 220 whatever 230 in

801
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:44,338
Washington I think it's not even

802
00:38:41,159 --> 00:38:46,379
required for retail cannabis to have the

803
00:38:44,338 --> 00:38:48,268
pesticide residue test you can opt in

804
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:52,140
and choose to but you don't have to that

805
00:38:48,268 --> 00:38:55,248
correct you know that's a great question

806
00:38:52,139 --> 00:38:58,259
i as I understood it there was some

807
00:38:55,248 --> 00:39:00,208
regulation that was put into place and I

808
00:38:58,259 --> 00:39:01,739
could be miss speaking here but as I

809
00:39:00,208 --> 00:39:04,368
understood it most growers knew that it

810
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:06,929
wasn't being enforced and so there are

811
00:39:04,369 --> 00:39:09,809
sort of what happened was this one

812
00:39:06,929 --> 00:39:12,358
particular dispensary uncle Ike's in

813
00:39:09,809 --> 00:39:15,929
Seattle kind of became like a third

814
00:39:12,358 --> 00:39:18,900
party check for people and they've found

815
00:39:15,929 --> 00:39:21,150
that a lot of not a lot but a

816
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:23,459
significant number of farms have failed

817
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:28,019
for things like Mike Michael butanol and

818
00:39:23,458 --> 00:39:29,038
Eagle 20 and it's it's been really it's

819
00:39:28,018 --> 00:39:30,748
been really challenging here in

820
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:32,699
Washington State

821
00:39:30,748 --> 00:39:34,139
because at the end of the day like

822
00:39:32,699 --> 00:39:37,380
you're taking people's word for things

823
00:39:34,139 --> 00:39:39,900
and that's what I like about a certified

824
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:41,669
kind with this this tissue testing is

825
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:44,789
that you have some quantifiable

826
00:39:41,668 --> 00:39:46,558
third-party data that shows you know

827
00:39:44,789 --> 00:39:51,449
unequivocally that this material is

828
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:53,669
clean yeah yeah and you know when you're

829
00:39:51,449 --> 00:39:55,858
developing a certification system

830
00:39:53,668 --> 00:39:57,629
third-party certification system a lot

831
00:39:55,858 --> 00:40:00,208
there is a lot of it that's built around

832
00:39:57,630 --> 00:40:04,039
trust so this testing kind of

833
00:40:00,208 --> 00:40:04,038
counterbalance is that and

834
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:12,028
and you know it's the other thing about

835
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:14,909
third-party certification is that if we

836
00:40:12,028 --> 00:40:17,190
were to certify somebody and then find

837
00:40:14,909 --> 00:40:23,068
out that they had been cheating using

838
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:25,528
fertilizers or pesticides or or selling

839
00:40:23,068 --> 00:40:30,210
product that didn't come from their farm

840
00:40:25,528 --> 00:40:32,730
a certified product I think that would

841
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:37,429
be a huge hit to the farms reputation as

842
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:41,010
well so you know you have the source of

843
00:40:37,429 --> 00:40:44,298
residue testing but also reputation all

844
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:47,460
these folks reputations are on the line

845
00:40:44,298 --> 00:40:49,259
when they when they sign up and part of

846
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:51,420
a certification you know they can be

847
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:52,950
proud say hey well you know we we walk

848
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:57,180
the walk we we went through the

849
00:40:52,949 --> 00:40:59,129
certification we passed but if they end

850
00:40:57,179 --> 00:41:03,019
up having to drop out for some reason

851
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:03,019
you know that that doesn't look too good

852
00:41:03,108 --> 00:41:08,038
so so what you're saying essentially the

853
00:41:05,579 --> 00:41:10,289
idea is that a company a grower is

854
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:12,089
buying in there it costs money for the

855
00:41:10,289 --> 00:41:15,059
certification and you're not the

856
00:41:12,088 --> 00:41:16,288
cheapest certification out there for it

857
00:41:15,059 --> 00:41:18,480
a lot of the reasons that you just

858
00:41:16,289 --> 00:41:21,299
listed but if they buy in essentially

859
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:24,028
they're buying into your certification

860
00:41:21,298 --> 00:41:28,650
your reputation that the certified kind

861
00:41:24,028 --> 00:41:30,539
brand has value because of the

862
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:32,760
stringency and the regulations that you

863
00:41:30,539 --> 00:41:34,890
put in place and so if they were to lose

864
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:36,359
that because they cheated or something

865
00:41:34,889 --> 00:41:39,598
else happened because that is I mean it

866
00:41:36,358 --> 00:41:41,940
happens that that potentially would hurt

867
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:43,950
their their company quite a bit and on

868
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:47,400
the other hand by getting this

869
00:41:43,949 --> 00:41:49,399
certification the idea is that as people

870
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:52,200
you know even more and more consumers

871
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:54,298
start worrying about organic quality and

872
00:41:52,199 --> 00:41:56,909
how their cannabis and medicine are

873
00:41:54,298 --> 00:41:59,489
being produced that that cannabis will

874
00:41:56,909 --> 00:42:03,149
have a higher market value so they can

875
00:41:59,489 --> 00:42:06,118
get maybe 20% more I made that number up

876
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:09,119
but but a enough of an increase in their

877
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:11,220
sales and the price of the flower that

878
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:13,710
they're growing to offset the cost of

879
00:42:11,219 --> 00:42:17,259
the certification exactly and I think

880
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:19,530
that that's where so far the

881
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:24,910
Annamayya certifications have struggled

882
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:28,060
so it's been a struggle to get that

883
00:42:24,909 --> 00:42:31,599
price P premium for the grower that is

884
00:42:28,059 --> 00:42:33,880
part of the certification so with

885
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:36,369
certified kind yeah you know folks are

886
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:39,970
able to get a price premium and they're

887
00:42:36,369 --> 00:42:41,409
also able to get into dispensaries that

888
00:42:39,969 --> 00:42:44,559
they might not otherwise have an

889
00:42:41,409 --> 00:42:47,739
introduction into because they can go

890
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:49,809
into dispensary and the dispensary knows

891
00:42:47,739 --> 00:42:53,519
what certified pine is okay you're

892
00:42:49,809 --> 00:42:56,349
certified under are great as opposed to

893
00:42:53,519 --> 00:42:59,769
you know some folks have to approach

894
00:42:56,349 --> 00:43:04,480
dispensaries just cold either just cold

895
00:42:59,769 --> 00:43:06,579
calling on these dispensaries so so the

896
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:08,769
certifications can help make business

897
00:43:06,579 --> 00:43:11,799
connections it can help it can help

898
00:43:08,769 --> 00:43:14,259
prove to some a complete stranger that

899
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:15,970
there's you know that they're farming in

900
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:21,520
a certain style in a certain way

901
00:43:15,969 --> 00:43:24,489
organically and they think that you know

902
00:43:21,519 --> 00:43:28,920
I should probably mention the Sun on

903
00:43:24,489 --> 00:43:31,029
earth program because one of the

904
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:35,340
interesting things about Sun earners

905
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:40,840
certified which I'm also part of is that

906
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:42,640
they've been able to demand for the

907
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:45,539
brother David's brand anyway that's the

908
00:43:42,639 --> 00:43:48,069
cannabis brand that David Bronner's has

909
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:51,340
created it's a non-profit cannabis brand

910
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:55,559
they've been able to leverage a 10%

911
00:43:51,340 --> 00:44:03,190
price premium for their growers that are

912
00:43:55,559 --> 00:44:05,289
marketing with them so yeah I want to

913
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:09,519
just touch on this so your job as a

914
00:44:05,289 --> 00:44:11,650
certifier is our certifying agency such

915
00:44:09,519 --> 00:44:14,590
as Sun and Earth or certified kind is

916
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:16,329
one to make sure that that the farm is

917
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:17,620
doing what they say they're doing that

918
00:44:16,329 --> 00:44:21,519
the product that's coming out of the

919
00:44:17,619 --> 00:44:25,210
farm is clean and in theory organic and

920
00:44:21,519 --> 00:44:27,369
then your other job is to educate the

921
00:44:25,210 --> 00:44:29,559
public so educate dispensaries so that

922
00:44:27,369 --> 00:44:31,719
when customers come in and ask

923
00:44:29,559 --> 00:44:33,429
you know what's what's your safest

924
00:44:31,719 --> 00:44:35,500
cannabis or what's your you know

925
00:44:33,429 --> 00:44:38,469
cleanest most organic cannabis they can

926
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:40,300
look at the certified kind or Sun and

927
00:44:38,469 --> 00:44:42,250
Earth certification as a way of knowing

928
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:43,960
that product is going to be of a certain

929
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:46,329
quality or at least produced a certain

930
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:50,260
in a certain fashion and then lastly to

931
00:44:46,329 --> 00:44:52,480
educate consumers so that a medical

932
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:54,370
patient or even a recreational user like

933
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:56,740
is someone up here in Washington could

934
00:44:54,369 --> 00:44:58,539
walk into a store and say hey what what

935
00:44:56,739 --> 00:44:59,949
can I get that's that's organic where

936
00:44:58,539 --> 00:45:01,259
that term actually might mean something

937
00:44:59,949 --> 00:45:03,730
they can then they could point to

938
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:07,290
certified kind or in California and you

939
00:45:03,730 --> 00:45:09,579
know certified kind and Sun and Earth I

940
00:45:07,289 --> 00:45:11,199
think that's really powerful so there's

941
00:45:09,579 --> 00:45:13,840
a lot of challenges associated with a

942
00:45:11,199 --> 00:45:16,000
with setting up a certifying agency like

943
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:18,100
yourself that I think people need to be

944
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,710
aware of but let's let's talk about

945
00:45:18,099 --> 00:45:24,219
Senator so Senator that goes so far

946
00:45:20,710 --> 00:45:26,500
beyond Organic Standards it's pretty

947
00:45:24,219 --> 00:45:28,239
incredible I just interviewed David

948
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:31,090
Bronner yesterday I may be putting out

949
00:45:28,239 --> 00:45:33,069
both these podcasts really soon do you

950
00:45:31,090 --> 00:45:34,840
want to just give your quick take on it

951
00:45:33,070 --> 00:45:36,190
cuz I did talk about it already and I

952
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:38,260
know you haven't heard David's podcast

953
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:40,690
so you're kind of firing from the hip

954
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:43,420
but what's your what's your quick you

955
00:45:40,690 --> 00:45:46,119
know one to two minute version of the

956
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:51,490
Sun and Earth certification yeah well

957
00:45:46,119 --> 00:45:53,319
you know if certified kind is helping to

958
00:45:51,489 --> 00:45:56,289
ensure that cars are following Organic

959
00:45:53,320 --> 00:46:01,030
Standards Sun and Earth certified goes

960
00:45:56,289 --> 00:46:04,869
beyond that so it's it's a level up from

961
00:46:01,030 --> 00:46:09,010
certified kind because it only they'll

962
00:46:04,869 --> 00:46:13,509
only certify or outdoor growers that are

963
00:46:09,010 --> 00:46:15,460
planting in native soil so that means

964
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:20,680
Under the Sun in any earth right that's

965
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:22,900
why it's called Sun on earth and there's

966
00:46:20,679 --> 00:46:27,339
also so those three pillars the Sun on

967
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:28,960
earth one is Earthcare and that's the

968
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:32,410
most rigorous part of the standard right

969
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:33,820
now the other two are community

970
00:46:32,409 --> 00:46:36,460
engagement

971
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:37,930
so it's it's human empowerment and

972
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:40,210
community engagement or the other two

973
00:46:37,929 --> 00:46:43,609
and that has to do with having written

974
00:46:40,210 --> 00:46:46,670
policies for for employees

975
00:46:43,610 --> 00:46:50,570
that protect them and it has to do with

976
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:52,820
engaging with the community so right now

977
00:46:50,570 --> 00:46:55,070
it's creating a written strategy about

978
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:57,380
how you will engage in uplift the local

979
00:46:55,070 --> 00:47:00,500
community that way the cannabis firms

980
00:46:57,380 --> 00:47:02,780
aren't just acting in isolation not just

981
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:06,440
exploiting land and resources but giving

982
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:09,350
back to the local community so on the

983
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:11,960
cultivation side though there's also

984
00:47:09,349 --> 00:47:17,000
additional standards there that make it

985
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:20,690
pretty difficult for example one of the

986
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:25,190
one of the hardest parts is producing

987
00:47:20,690 --> 00:47:30,039
your own fertility on your from on-farm

988
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:35,269
resources so there's a requirement that

989
00:47:30,039 --> 00:47:38,739
requires composting on-site increasing

990
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:42,409
biodiversity you know so on these farms

991
00:47:38,739 --> 00:47:45,829
so far a lot of them are on the smaller

992
00:47:42,409 --> 00:47:48,319
side but there are some that are you

993
00:47:45,829 --> 00:47:51,340
know around 40,000 square feet as well

994
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:55,039
and they're doing things like

995
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:59,630
polyculture which means planting

996
00:47:55,039 --> 00:48:02,389
cannabis and other plants together one

997
00:47:59,630 --> 00:48:06,170
of the farms planted potatoes on both

998
00:48:02,389 --> 00:48:08,210
sides of their cannabis row and I'm not

999
00:48:06,170 --> 00:48:11,690
just talking like one potato here and

1000
00:48:08,210 --> 00:48:15,139
there but like a full-on potato planting

1001
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:17,869
every foot for 300 feet on both sides of

1002
00:48:15,139 --> 00:48:19,309
the cannabis row you know so that's

1003
00:48:17,869 --> 00:48:23,359
amazing

1004
00:48:19,309 --> 00:48:26,420
that type of commitment to biodiversity

1005
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:30,230
on the farm and and growing food on the

1006
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:32,180
firm's well you know some of these farms

1007
00:48:30,230 --> 00:48:38,119
there's a farm down there that Senators

1008
00:48:32,179 --> 00:48:41,000
certified that only uses this plant this

1009
00:48:38,119 --> 00:48:43,849
algae this blue it's like a say oh no

1010
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:47,719
it's like a algae that has a symbiotic

1011
00:48:43,849 --> 00:48:49,369
relationship with cyanobacteria it's

1012
00:48:47,719 --> 00:48:52,099
called a Zola have you ever heard of it

1013
00:48:49,369 --> 00:48:54,259
I haven't done a lot of research on

1014
00:48:52,099 --> 00:48:54,929
algae but I'm somewhat familiar with

1015
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:56,369
what you're talking

1016
00:48:54,929 --> 00:48:59,190
about yeah it's pretty I did an

1017
00:48:56,369 --> 00:49:00,690
interesting subject for sure yeah anyway

1018
00:48:59,190 --> 00:49:04,019
there's a farm down there that has a

1019
00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:06,389
pond it's covered in Azolla and they

1020
00:49:04,019 --> 00:49:08,670
just take the azolla out of the pond

1021
00:49:06,389 --> 00:49:12,000
it's that prolific in their pond and

1022
00:49:08,670 --> 00:49:15,119
they use that as a soil amendment and

1023
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:19,139
they use water and that's it

1024
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:21,559
and so so the sun-earth certified

1025
00:49:19,139 --> 00:49:26,759
program is trying to help some

1026
00:49:21,559 --> 00:49:30,240
small-scale family farmers in in in

1027
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:34,859
northern california maintain their way

1028
00:49:30,239 --> 00:49:37,979
of life essentially and they have

1029
00:49:34,858 --> 00:49:40,230
partner in that program is dr. Bronner's

1030
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:42,809
and they have a David Bronner has his

1031
00:49:40,230 --> 00:49:46,369
own nonprofit canvass brand called

1032
00:49:42,809 --> 00:49:51,030
brother David's and the farms that are

1033
00:49:46,369 --> 00:49:55,380
that that they put underneath that brand

1034
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:57,660
um get a price premium and are pretty

1035
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:59,338
happy with the arrangement and that's

1036
00:49:57,659 --> 00:50:00,779
the other important piece you know it's

1037
00:49:59,338 --> 00:50:04,440
like if you're gonna have a third-party

1038
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:06,298
certification and we have to take care

1039
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:09,230
of the farmer and we have to educate the

1040
00:50:06,298 --> 00:50:12,780
consumer like you mentioned and so I

1041
00:50:09,230 --> 00:50:14,490
think all I think the Senators program

1042
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:18,869
is nice because it's going to raise the

1043
00:50:14,489 --> 00:50:22,939
awareness of certification the value of

1044
00:50:18,869 --> 00:50:25,500
certification in California and

1045
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:28,500
hopefully it will become a model where

1046
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:31,559
we can have more of a unified cannabis

1047
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:33,750
certification nationwide and that model

1048
00:50:31,559 --> 00:50:36,089
is really that these cannabis brands

1049
00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:40,170
that are profiting off the farms

1050
00:50:36,088 --> 00:50:43,739
themselves are paying in to help the

1051
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:45,930
farmers pay for certification these

1052
00:50:43,739 --> 00:50:49,108
brands are helping pay for education

1053
00:50:45,929 --> 00:50:51,808
about why regenitive organic practices

1054
00:50:49,108 --> 00:50:54,509
are important and why consumers should

1055
00:50:51,809 --> 00:50:58,109
vote with their dollar and and support

1056
00:50:54,510 --> 00:51:01,890
these farms yeah and I think the fact

1057
00:50:58,108 --> 00:51:04,440
that you have a company as you know as

1058
00:51:01,889 --> 00:51:07,500
wonderful and ethical as dr. Bronner

1059
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:09,360
supporting you in this certification is

1060
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:11,909
huge you know I think that goes a long

1061
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:15,539
way and really getting getting the

1062
00:51:11,909 --> 00:51:17,549
message out for people and yeah the

1063
00:51:15,539 --> 00:51:19,529
standard itself I suggest everyone even

1064
00:51:17,550 --> 00:51:20,789
if you're not you know thinking that's

1065
00:51:19,530 --> 00:51:22,440
the direction you're gonna go with your

1066
00:51:20,789 --> 00:51:23,820
farm I suggest people go out there and

1067
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:26,610
just take a look at it on the website

1068
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:29,070
I'll have the links to everything on the

1069
00:51:26,610 --> 00:51:31,320
podcast page for a certified kind and

1070
00:51:29,070 --> 00:51:33,630
Sun and Earth but it would give you an

1071
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:36,059
idea of what what standards are

1072
00:51:33,630 --> 00:51:38,640
necessary if you decide that you want to

1073
00:51:36,059 --> 00:51:40,380
be organic or even if you're not ready

1074
00:51:38,639 --> 00:51:42,869
to go there right now but in the future

1075
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:45,599
if you see you know in your state that

1076
00:51:42,869 --> 00:51:47,069
becoming something that has value this

1077
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:49,049
is a way to set yourself up to be

1078
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:51,059
successful now because I know what Sun

1079
00:51:49,050 --> 00:51:52,260
and Earth and I haven't I need to go

1080
00:51:51,059 --> 00:51:53,519
back and read the standards for a

1081
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:56,430
certified kind but I know it's sudden

1082
00:51:53,519 --> 00:51:59,130
earth just like with the USDA you need

1083
00:51:56,429 --> 00:52:01,409
to have three years of organic practices

1084
00:51:59,130 --> 00:52:04,980
on a property before you can be even

1085
00:52:01,409 --> 00:52:07,500
considered is that is that accurate yeah

1086
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:09,869
that's accurate the way organic

1087
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:13,889
certification works around the world is

1088
00:52:09,869 --> 00:52:17,369
they've selected three years as the

1089
00:52:13,889 --> 00:52:20,819
transition period so that's you need to

1090
00:52:17,369 --> 00:52:23,130
have a clean land history for the three

1091
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:26,580
years prior to the harvest that you're

1092
00:52:23,130 --> 00:52:28,289
going to be calling certified organic so

1093
00:52:26,579 --> 00:52:30,449
yeah that means people need to plan

1094
00:52:28,289 --> 00:52:33,659
ahead but the other thing that's

1095
00:52:30,449 --> 00:52:36,750
interesting is that in a in an indoor

1096
00:52:33,659 --> 00:52:39,809
setting where you're coming in

1097
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:42,630
containers with new organic approved

1098
00:52:39,809 --> 00:52:47,009
potting soil you kidding you can

1099
00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:51,380
decrease that time so you know you can

1100
00:52:47,010 --> 00:52:54,090
get an a certification more quickly on

1101
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:55,860
virgin land or fallow land that hasn't

1102
00:52:54,090 --> 00:52:59,400
been far in the last three years or an

1103
00:52:55,860 --> 00:53:00,480
indoor facility with new ponds well

1104
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:03,510
that's interesting I wasn't aware of

1105
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:05,190
that and great just to be clear you've

1106
00:53:03,510 --> 00:53:07,290
looked at you've you think you know my

1107
00:53:05,190 --> 00:53:09,539
recipe in my soil like my soul would

1108
00:53:07,289 --> 00:53:13,369
qualify kiss organic soil qualifies for

1109
00:53:09,539 --> 00:53:15,779
your program grout oh yeah we have a

1110
00:53:13,369 --> 00:53:20,690
number of the indoor growers are using

1111
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:22,730
your soil yeah you're so

1112
00:53:20,690 --> 00:53:25,220
for organic it's double usda-approved

1113
00:53:22,730 --> 00:53:28,429
and it sounds like it's CDFA oh I am a

1114
00:53:25,219 --> 00:53:31,789
fruit so yeah okay that was my that was

1115
00:53:28,429 --> 00:53:33,259
my Ken shameless plug no oh no and I

1116
00:53:31,789 --> 00:53:36,460
think we also got it approved with

1117
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:39,050
Oregon so a few years a few years ago

1118
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:41,900
yeah I really I really appreciate your

1119
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:43,430
help with all of that well is there

1120
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:45,260
anything you want to add just before we

1121
00:53:43,429 --> 00:53:47,568
sign off regarding what you're seeing on

1122
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:50,480
these farms since you are visiting so

1123
00:53:47,568 --> 00:53:52,429
many farms any you know potential

1124
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:54,108
pitfalls or stumbling blocks that are

1125
00:53:52,429 --> 00:53:56,088
really common for farms that are

1126
00:53:54,108 --> 00:54:01,909
interested in moving towards organic

1127
00:53:56,088 --> 00:54:05,630
certification well yeah a pitfall would

1128
00:54:01,909 --> 00:54:07,129
be to not do your research not do your

1129
00:54:05,630 --> 00:54:09,829
homework if you want organic

1130
00:54:07,130 --> 00:54:13,818
certification you can't rely on somebody

1131
00:54:09,829 --> 00:54:16,700
trying to tell you or convince you that

1132
00:54:13,818 --> 00:54:19,369
a certain fertilizer is allowed in

1133
00:54:16,699 --> 00:54:24,019
organics unless you absolutely know that

1134
00:54:19,369 --> 00:54:28,608
it is and so that's I see that a lot

1135
00:54:24,019 --> 00:54:30,440
like you know uneducated people or

1136
00:54:28,608 --> 00:54:33,309
people that don't really know what

1137
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:36,108
organics means trying to convince

1138
00:54:33,309 --> 00:54:39,559
managers or owners that a certain input

1139
00:54:36,108 --> 00:54:43,909
is allowed when it has actually

1140
00:54:39,559 --> 00:54:52,250
synthetic calcium nitrate in it or you

1141
00:54:43,909 --> 00:54:55,309
know monopotassium phosphate so so first

1142
00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:58,639
of all do your homework and get away

1143
00:54:55,309 --> 00:54:59,929
from bottled nutrients because a lot of

1144
00:54:58,639 --> 00:55:02,088
the bottle of nutrients do have

1145
00:54:59,929 --> 00:55:05,679
synthetic chemical fertilizers in them

1146
00:55:02,088 --> 00:55:08,389
and the whole concept of organic is

1147
00:55:05,679 --> 00:55:11,179
trying to enhance natural nutrient

1148
00:55:08,389 --> 00:55:13,549
cycling in your soil you can do that in

1149
00:55:11,179 --> 00:55:14,960
if you're an indoor grower you can do

1150
00:55:13,550 --> 00:55:21,560
that definitely if you're an outdoor

1151
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:25,190
grower I I think that folks are starting

1152
00:55:21,559 --> 00:55:27,769
to experiment with plant ferments and a

1153
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:30,019
lot of the people that are deep into

1154
00:55:27,769 --> 00:55:34,519
plant ferments this is like Korean

1155
00:55:30,019 --> 00:55:38,360
natural farming they they

1156
00:55:34,519 --> 00:55:43,070
see higher or unique terpenes being

1157
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:44,750
expressed but you know a strategy and

1158
00:55:43,070 --> 00:55:49,490
organics would be not to put all your

1159
00:55:44,750 --> 00:55:52,309
eggs in one basket either so I would say

1160
00:55:49,489 --> 00:55:56,539
you know although some of these things

1161
00:55:52,309 --> 00:55:59,900
are trending right now you always have

1162
00:55:56,539 --> 00:56:01,969
to keep an open mind but stick with what

1163
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:04,280
you what works for you you know in

1164
00:56:01,969 --> 00:56:08,059
organics and so for a lot of folks

1165
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:11,690
that's you know if they're outdoors you

1166
00:56:08,059 --> 00:56:14,869
take a soil test you you valuate it and

1167
00:56:11,690 --> 00:56:18,139
you apply organic soil amendments prior

1168
00:56:14,869 --> 00:56:20,359
to planting and what we learned with

1169
00:56:18,139 --> 00:56:23,739
hemp this year was that if done properly

1170
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:28,750
you don't need to apply any other

1171
00:56:23,739 --> 00:56:35,649
amendment or for fertigation step at all

1172
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:40,460
and so devising like these simple

1173
00:56:35,650 --> 00:56:44,539
systems is the best way to go like a

1174
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:48,050
complex feeding schedule is isn't

1175
00:56:44,539 --> 00:56:52,219
necessary and in it it is probably going

1176
00:56:48,050 --> 00:56:54,830
to confuse you and you're not going to

1177
00:56:52,219 --> 00:56:56,419
know how to tweak it really I would say

1178
00:56:54,829 --> 00:57:00,440
just you know if you're trying to go

1179
00:56:56,420 --> 00:57:03,050
organic so as simple as possible that's

1180
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:05,990
good advice and just to build on your

1181
00:57:03,050 --> 00:57:08,900
your previous comment one thing I

1182
00:57:05,989 --> 00:57:11,059
learned from being a supplier to the

1183
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:13,309
organic industry on the AG and

1184
00:57:11,059 --> 00:57:14,960
horticultural side is you always want to

1185
00:57:13,309 --> 00:57:16,579
check with a certifier before you apply

1186
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:18,650
anything if you're not sure about a

1187
00:57:16,579 --> 00:57:21,380
bottle of nutrient or an amendment or

1188
00:57:18,650 --> 00:57:23,180
anything like that call up a certifier

1189
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:24,769
and and double-check those lists so you

1190
00:57:23,179 --> 00:57:26,899
can look on the Omni list and you can

1191
00:57:24,769 --> 00:57:28,699
look on the double USDA and CDFA lists

1192
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:31,519
and see if that product is listed and if

1193
00:57:28,699 --> 00:57:33,769
it's not do not apply it without talking

1194
00:57:31,519 --> 00:57:37,340
to whoever sort of fire you're working

1195
00:57:33,769 --> 00:57:39,349
with because it's much easier to go to

1196
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:41,960
not apply a product than it is to deal

1197
00:57:39,349 --> 00:57:44,750
with the aftermath of applying something

1198
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:47,210
that wasn't allowed so oh yeah that's

1199
00:57:44,750 --> 00:57:48,440
the worst it's the worst

1200
00:57:47,210 --> 00:57:50,300
you know because you

1201
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:54,559
it's your land kicked out for three

1202
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:58,430
years for applying something that's not

1203
00:57:54,559 --> 00:58:00,139
allowed in organics yeah well hey Andrew
