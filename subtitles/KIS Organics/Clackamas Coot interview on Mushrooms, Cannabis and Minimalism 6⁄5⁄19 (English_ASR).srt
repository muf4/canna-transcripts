1
00:00:07,179 --> 00:00:11,899
hey Jim how's it going good to get to

2
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:14,509
chat with you again good to talk with

3
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:16,429
you today are you doing I'm good I'm

4
00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:19,009
good I know we've talked a lot off air

5
00:00:16,429 --> 00:00:20,269
but I wanted to record a video because I

6
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:21,920
know there's a lot of people that have

7
00:00:20,269 --> 00:00:24,410
wanted to hear from you and hear what

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,540
you've been up to I know personally

9
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:28,280
you're less involved with the cannabis

10
00:00:26,539 --> 00:00:30,320
scene as you used to be and you've been

11
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,820
getting more into mushrooms but do you

12
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,128
want to just kind of fill people in on

13
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:38,689
what what's been going on in your life

14
00:00:33,128 --> 00:00:42,229
sure I thank you for asking I had we

15
00:00:38,689 --> 00:00:47,328
were able to pay off our house a few

16
00:00:42,229 --> 00:00:51,500
months ago and I don't know I just

17
00:00:47,329 --> 00:00:54,140
decided to remodel and I got rid of

18
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:56,840
we've been here 17 years and got rid of

19
00:00:54,140 --> 00:01:00,799
17 years of junk it's just amazing I

20
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:04,338
mean I went through 17 years of computer

21
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:06,978
equipment like why did I buy this you

22
00:01:04,338 --> 00:01:10,450
know so it's been kind of a semi

23
00:01:06,978 --> 00:01:15,099
approach to minimal as my efficiency and

24
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:17,420
and I really got really really tired of

25
00:01:15,099 --> 00:01:21,288
being involved on any level at the

26
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:26,228
Cannabis scene so I contract my growing

27
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:29,409
to somebody that I trust outdoors and I

28
00:01:26,228 --> 00:01:32,209
get extremely nice yield of high quality

29
00:01:29,409 --> 00:01:38,599
flowers and that everybody go have a

30
00:01:32,209 --> 00:01:39,920
good time and just for needing some

31
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:43,278
recreation I guess you'd say and I

32
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,849
really enjoy growing things still do I

33
00:01:43,278 --> 00:01:49,158
got involved in growing mushrooms and

34
00:01:45,849 --> 00:01:51,079
working with a fellow that you would

35
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:56,868
know I think is set it and forget it

36
00:01:51,078 --> 00:02:01,818
organics on Instagram and so we worked

37
00:01:56,868 --> 00:02:04,549
through some different recipes and for

38
00:02:01,819 --> 00:02:08,420
the substrate and actually is

39
00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:11,659
interesting one of the books that I used

40
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:14,659
was organic mushroom farming and sarra

41
00:02:11,659 --> 00:02:18,539
remediation by gentleman from North

42
00:02:14,659 --> 00:02:20,878
Carolina and it was the first how to

43
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:25,318
that actually mentioned things like you

44
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:28,409
know earthworm castings rock dust so I

45
00:02:25,318 --> 00:02:32,458
kind of felt a kindred hey I'm back home

46
00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:34,348
you know that's pretty cool and so yeah

47
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:37,650
it's been really fun and growing your

48
00:02:34,348 --> 00:02:42,598
own food and as well as the medicine on

49
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:45,780
the lion mane and what you would know as

50
00:02:42,598 --> 00:02:48,479
maitake some in the northwest refer to

51
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:51,870
it as hen of the woods but there's

52
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:54,899
several turkey tail and other mushrooms

53
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:59,209
that we can grow that have long

54
00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:02,549
established histories is terms of

55
00:02:59,209 --> 00:03:06,509
medicinal out primarily out of Asia

56
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:09,000
China and Japan and then of course the

57
00:03:06,509 --> 00:03:13,009
the food the culinary mushrooms are

58
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,659
really exciting to grow like oysters

59
00:03:13,009 --> 00:03:17,848
which are the easiest mushroom in the

60
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:19,919
world to grow and that one I would

61
00:03:17,848 --> 00:03:22,289
recommend people start with so they

62
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:25,078
don't get some stumbling blocks I mean I

63
00:03:22,289 --> 00:03:27,539
wouldn't start out with growing lion's

64
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:29,670
mane for example I probably do mushrooms

65
00:03:27,539 --> 00:03:32,039
and then kind of work up nice especially

66
00:03:29,669 --> 00:03:35,449
for the outdoor gardens we can use wine

67
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:38,189
caps and so not only are we growing food

68
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:41,929
but it's also doing some wonderful

69
00:03:38,189 --> 00:03:44,579
things with the soil in deconstructing

70
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:46,829
the carbon sources that are in the so

71
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:48,900
maybe like luck for example well you

72
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:52,439
know it's better night it you create

73
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:58,009
soils a lot of potting soils have a lot

74
00:03:52,439 --> 00:04:00,989
of wood in it wood chips so by using

75
00:03:58,009 --> 00:04:03,209
mycelium we can deconstruct that and it

76
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:06,359
just adds to the human of the soil you

77
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:07,289
know the nutrient profile so it's

78
00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:09,000
win-win

79
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:11,879
you're not only improving the soil but

80
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,669
we're also growing viable food good

81
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:20,370
source of B vitamins and protein what

82
00:04:14,669 --> 00:04:22,288
have you now a couple things a couple

83
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:26,009
questions I had because I am NOT a

84
00:04:22,288 --> 00:04:28,500
mushroom expert I love eating mushrooms

85
00:04:26,009 --> 00:04:30,839
I loved the interview with Paul Stamets

86
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:33,060
that on the Joe Rogan podcast that was

87
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:36,029
sort of some of this stuff around like

88
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:37,918
lion's mane creating new neurological

89
00:04:36,029 --> 00:04:40,709
connections in your brain and it's right

90
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:45,089
or ways that people are using fungi

91
00:04:40,709 --> 00:04:47,189
which is incredible and I've always had

92
00:04:45,089 --> 00:04:49,019
been a little bit I think there's a term

93
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:52,560
for it and I might have it wrong but I

94
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:54,930
think it's Micah phobic yeah oh yeah yep

95
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,699
the sense of like going out my brother

96
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:57,930
for example will go out and harvest wild

97
00:04:56,699 --> 00:05:00,598
mushrooms and that makes me really

98
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:02,819
nervous not knowing what I'm gonna be

99
00:05:00,598 --> 00:05:04,620
consuming me just because the dangers

100
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:06,300
associated with them and learning how to

101
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:11,158
do support prints and things like that

102
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:13,050
so I always heard that you need to be

103
00:05:11,158 --> 00:05:16,620
have very sterile conditions to grow

104
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:19,319
mushrooms and you need you need to be

105
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:21,300
very careful and it can be so dangerous

106
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:24,449
because some of these mushrooms are

107
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:26,728
toxic so mm-hmm it's almost like there's

108
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:30,029
this fear-based thing around mushrooms

109
00:05:26,728 --> 00:05:31,560
that is sort of more the public opinion

110
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:37,829
that doesn't sound like is really

111
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:41,490
accurate no and and culturally that

112
00:05:37,829 --> 00:05:45,658
phobia whatever we want to call it goes

113
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:52,050
back millennia I mean this isn't

114
00:05:45,658 --> 00:05:54,750
something new what I suggest people

115
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:59,300
consider is that for example Paul

116
00:05:54,750 --> 00:06:03,810
Stamets up at fungi calm he sells a

117
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:06,360
sponge so the the part of the process

118
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:09,120
that requires the sterilization and

119
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,860
almost lab conditions will say he's

120
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,468
already done it i fact they sent you a

121
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:15,598
link this morning in preparation for

122
00:06:13,468 --> 00:06:19,769
this for several varieties of mushrooms

123
00:06:15,598 --> 00:06:23,610
that you could buy with confidence and

124
00:06:19,769 --> 00:06:26,519
this font is it's already colonized with

125
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:28,530
the correct whether it be hoisters or

126
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:30,658
what are these guys shiitake and

127
00:06:28,529 --> 00:06:33,509
probably whatever and there's other

128
00:06:30,658 --> 00:06:35,819
there's other sources too so for people

129
00:06:33,509 --> 00:06:38,098
that are concerned I mean I'm not gonna

130
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:40,370
go walk around there were Civic

131
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:43,168
Northwest go well I think that's a I

132
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:43,860
mean take a class you know there's the

133
00:06:43,168 --> 00:06:46,229
American Mike

134
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:49,020
the association that has branches and

135
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:52,350
state organizations I know one or two in

136
00:06:49,019 --> 00:06:54,659
Washington you know it's kind of fun you

137
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:58,500
get out with a group of people and an

138
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:59,970
expert and you know it's if you're going

139
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:03,209
to do that I would suggest taking a

140
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:04,920
class and do a lot of reading with books

141
00:07:03,209 --> 00:07:06,359
that have and try to get the digital

142
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:09,330
version so it's on your iPhone or

143
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,710
something so you can do some

144
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:12,180
identification

145
00:07:10,709 --> 00:07:14,370
now some of them you're not I mean

146
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:17,370
obviously you're not going to confuse

147
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:20,610
the lion's mane with a toadstool sure

148
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:25,699
and some of the other ones that we find

149
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:29,040
growing on the timber itself like reishi

150
00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:31,379
but and those you buy the plugs they're

151
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:37,110
already inoculated you drill a hole and

152
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:39,540
you insert the plug in away you go so

153
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:45,439
that's probably the path of alleviating

154
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:48,540
some of those concerns but I am with you

155
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:50,009
when people send me pictures look what

156
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:52,740
do you think this is how do we want an

157
00:07:50,009 --> 00:07:55,529
operative opinion I don't yeah I

158
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:57,600
wouldn't be cooking needing it unless

159
00:07:55,529 --> 00:07:59,009
you know that your drunken

160
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:02,220
brother-in-law is coming over something

161
00:07:59,009 --> 00:08:04,319
maybe that we always start with a

162
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:06,570
positive identification that sounds like

163
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:09,259
absolutely yes that's claimer to throw

164
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:11,790
out there to people absolutely and and

165
00:08:09,259 --> 00:08:15,360
barring that until you feel comfortable

166
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:18,750
then I would buy spawn inoculate air

167
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:23,280
colonies gives me colonized medium more

168
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:28,199
often than not wood chips and but I know

169
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:33,600
for example Doug at Northwest red worms

170
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:35,850
he used to grow oysters the white

171
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:39,779
oysters the standard one I guess you say

172
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:43,500
in these plastic bags that you hang from

173
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:46,769
the rafters so it's got pretty nice

174
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,639
analogy uses a medium oh newspaper and

175
00:08:46,769 --> 00:08:52,679
coffee grounds

176
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:56,129
that's excuse me I know they saw a video

177
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:57,419
out to find it for you but the guy grew

178
00:08:56,129 --> 00:09:01,200
it on old tennis shoes

179
00:08:57,419 --> 00:09:02,429
I remembered this is really an important

180
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,300
thing I think in this whole discussion

181
00:09:02,429 --> 00:09:11,459
punch I was here before plants which

182
00:09:06,299 --> 00:09:14,729
preceded the animal kingdom and they're

183
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:16,740
gonna be around long after the insects

184
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:21,420
are gone

185
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:22,889
I think the role that one of the most

186
00:09:21,419 --> 00:09:24,929
important books a person could read I

187
00:09:22,889 --> 00:09:27,809
think is I think you read you have a

188
00:09:24,929 --> 00:09:30,149
copy of this mycelium running hi Paul

189
00:09:27,809 --> 00:09:33,689
Stamets and I think that's that should

190
00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:40,949
be like the primer for anybody to get a

191
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:46,130
grasp of how much Punjab the role it

192
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:49,379
plays in our world sure yeah other

193
00:09:46,129 --> 00:09:52,740
primary decomposers so when you say an

194
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:53,549
old shoe or coffee grounds they're gonna

195
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,649
be one of the things that's really

196
00:09:53,549 --> 00:09:56,849
efficient and breaking down carbon oh

197
00:09:55,649 --> 00:10:01,490
absolutely

198
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:07,200
now go ahead well no I

199
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:09,690
for example the a popular one would be

200
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:12,240
straw okay so you got a good source of

201
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:13,710
lignin and carbon whatever I start

202
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,570
thinking it through the eyes you know

203
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:19,769
like wait a minute

204
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:22,650
what are they doing in Asia so I looked

205
00:10:19,769 --> 00:10:24,449
and rice hulls well for me it's a lot

206
00:10:22,649 --> 00:10:27,000
easier messing around rice holes and

207
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:28,500
getting a bale of whatever you know

208
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,980
because like just run up the

209
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:35,490
concentrates and get the stamp like you

210
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:37,710
buy you know was it okay they sell by

211
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:39,860
the pound or fifty pounders by cubic

212
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:43,019
feet but it's a lot of rice holes for

213
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:46,379
you know under 20 bucks I tell you that

214
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:49,110
and so that's really inexpensive and I

215
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:51,799
don't have to mess around with straw you

216
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:55,200
know trying to bust up a bale though I

217
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:57,839
have done some work with another

218
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:01,610
gentleman and we used bales of straw

219
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:08,129
that we picked up from a feed store and

220
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:10,840
put some of the colonized spawn use that

221
00:11:08,129 --> 00:11:16,419
to then inoculate the

222
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:21,120
and yeah it's not so so you're working

223
00:11:16,419 --> 00:11:22,899
with call a nice spawn but I know

224
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,870
essentially what you're saying is you

225
00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:28,269
don't need sterile media to grow that

226
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:30,669
spawn out based on right

227
00:11:28,269 --> 00:11:38,528
actually what you want is okay the way

228
00:11:30,669 --> 00:11:43,199
that that I was taught and we use

229
00:11:38,528 --> 00:11:46,570
pasteurized substrate not sterilized and

230
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:50,230
we're gonna go back to your expertise in

231
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:55,360
history with dealing with microbes in a

232
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:59,740
soil in a soil mix so we don't want a

233
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:04,450
completely sterile medium because nature

234
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:09,669
abhors a vacuum right so you're gonna

235
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:12,339
get contaminants whereas if you

236
00:12:09,669 --> 00:12:14,079
pasteurize it you're still leaving and I

237
00:12:12,339 --> 00:12:17,290
really dislike using this phrase but

238
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:19,780
this is a popular one you leave the good

239
00:12:17,289 --> 00:12:22,000
guys there the good microbes there in

240
00:12:19,779 --> 00:12:24,250
the pasteurization which just simply

241
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,480
means you're soaking the material in

242
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:33,909
water between 160 and 180 Fahrenheit for

243
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:36,789
a period of well I'll go with hour hour

244
00:12:33,909 --> 00:12:39,129
and 15 minutes and that is going to give

245
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:41,949
you a clean substrate but it's not going

246
00:12:39,129 --> 00:12:44,740
to be sterile and so especially if

247
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:47,259
you're growing most popular because it's

248
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:50,529
the easiest one to grow the most widely

249
00:12:47,259 --> 00:12:54,389
grown or the oyster in a good way

250
00:12:50,529 --> 00:12:57,789
they're very invasive so once it gets

251
00:12:54,389 --> 00:13:02,679
that substrate they take over and that's

252
00:12:57,789 --> 00:13:04,569
a good thing so just like you know we

253
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:10,000
deal with our compost teas you want to

254
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:14,230
put add the correct aerobic microbial

255
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,299
colonies which will keep the anaerobic

256
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:19,360
colonies at bay or destroy them what

257
00:13:16,299 --> 00:13:22,059
have you so it's still the same science

258
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:24,579
that that isn't different and that makes

259
00:13:22,059 --> 00:13:27,938
it because you can go to Amazon right

260
00:13:24,578 --> 00:13:31,688
down for under $20 get a cardboard box

261
00:13:27,938 --> 00:13:33,488
with a moister mushroom start in it and

262
00:13:31,688 --> 00:13:34,988
you open the box ever said it know what

263
00:13:33,489 --> 00:13:39,610
you get to watch it grow over the next

264
00:13:34,989 --> 00:13:41,199
several days so that's I think is really

265
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:43,568
cool because it gives people thought

266
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:47,919
well I can do this if they're

267
00:13:43,568 --> 00:13:49,928
manufacturing this and wherever and

268
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:51,399
shipping around the country I mean

269
00:13:49,928 --> 00:13:54,488
they're good repeat business so

270
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:56,860
obviously it's not some big you know

271
00:13:54,489 --> 00:13:59,790
feat to grow it and that would get dead

272
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:02,769
good two-person confidence to buy the

273
00:13:59,789 --> 00:14:06,879
colonized spawn from Paul Stamets and

274
00:14:02,769 --> 00:14:11,889
others some for that you want to maybe

275
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:13,600
grow in a like a plastic tub but other

276
00:14:11,889 --> 00:14:18,068
varieties you'd want to put out your

277
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:20,230
garden like the white caps those but the

278
00:14:18,068 --> 00:14:23,019
wine cap is actually one of their

279
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:25,959
nicknames is soiled Buster so if you

280
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:27,999
have really hard soils you know you know

281
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:32,738
what I'm talking about rather get out

282
00:14:27,999 --> 00:14:35,439
the El Toro roto tiller yeah we can use

283
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:37,809
this and it plus it's then gonna give

284
00:14:35,438 --> 00:14:39,610
you crumb which you know more about that

285
00:14:37,808 --> 00:14:43,899
than I do the importance of crumb the

286
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:47,289
Lukey methods control microbiology in

287
00:14:43,899 --> 00:14:48,869
our soils and it's just fun you know

288
00:14:47,289 --> 00:14:52,738
especially it's a really good learning

289
00:14:48,869 --> 00:14:56,559
I've been working with people adding

290
00:14:52,739 --> 00:14:59,100
spawn to their worm bins so we're gonna

291
00:14:56,558 --> 00:15:03,068
raise the fungal level in the

292
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:06,058
vermicompost and while we're doing that

293
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:08,168
we're gonna be able to harvest some food

294
00:15:06,058 --> 00:15:10,238
how are you doing that if you're not

295
00:15:08,168 --> 00:15:13,350
pasteurizing the worm bin because that

296
00:15:10,239 --> 00:15:18,449
would kill the worms well because worm

297
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:25,269
vermicompost in the very nature and it's

298
00:15:18,448 --> 00:15:27,248
ecosystem is very I would only use the

299
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:32,318
word antiseptic but it's a very clean

300
00:15:27,249 --> 00:15:34,058
medium we adulterated okay and I'm not

301
00:15:32,318 --> 00:15:36,849
suggesting that we want to grow and

302
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:38,169
straight worm castings I'm not but

303
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:42,430
that's a very

304
00:15:38,169 --> 00:15:44,349
very pure medium to start with and so if

305
00:15:42,429 --> 00:15:48,039
a person just took really quality

306
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:51,159
vermicompost and I've done this myself

307
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:54,849
and mixed it about one part compost to

308
00:15:51,159 --> 00:16:00,389
three parts vermicompost with the three

309
00:15:54,850 --> 00:16:00,389
parts of rice hulls which I did

310
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:06,250
pasteurized not sterile and then added

311
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:11,500
just some kelp you get tired of hearing

312
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:18,360
this but kelp mean a company and malted

313
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:22,600
barley to the substrate because the malt

314
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:25,659
fungi are enzyme engines and we already

315
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:31,470
have several hundred year history of

316
00:16:25,659 --> 00:16:35,500
using those very enzymes created by

317
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:38,170
barley in bread baking it's what they

318
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:39,940
call diastatic malt that's added to the

319
00:16:38,169 --> 00:16:41,649
dough to increase the activity of the

320
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:43,350
yeast so what's yeast like Easton's a

321
00:16:41,649 --> 00:16:47,860
single-cell fungi

322
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:49,540
so I decided huh I wonder if this will

323
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:52,449
do anything for the ones I was trying to

324
00:16:49,539 --> 00:16:55,389
grow it sure did oh wow this is really

325
00:16:52,448 --> 00:16:57,759
cool so here's a product for 80 cents a

326
00:16:55,389 --> 00:17:01,328
pound that you I added to a substrate

327
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:05,129
recipe and set it forget it organics

328
00:17:01,328 --> 00:17:08,048
he's been doing a lot of work with on

329
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:10,240
substrate recipes and trying to use

330
00:17:08,048 --> 00:17:18,389
things that are would be easy for people

331
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:18,390
to locate like core even coconut core or

332
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:25,000
Spagna peat moss and things like that

333
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:26,949
but we're trying to use everyday not

334
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:32,200
trying to make it some exactly because

335
00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:34,660
it doesn't need to be you know it trying

336
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:38,590
to keep it easy yeah for people to

337
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:40,298
understand and I don't you know there's

338
00:17:38,589 --> 00:17:43,149
there's some good books out there and

339
00:17:40,298 --> 00:17:45,039
one is a not exactly the most exciting

340
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:47,980
name but it's called mushroom

341
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:51,819
cultivation and it's strictly about

342
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:55,509
outdoor gardens adding different

343
00:17:51,819 --> 00:17:57,939
deities of edible mushrooms that we can

344
00:17:55,509 --> 00:18:01,839
use and not only to improve the tilt in

345
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:05,110
our garden plots but also provide us

346
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:08,679
with a good viable protein source so for

347
00:18:05,109 --> 00:18:12,369
vegetarians and even vegans this is a

348
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:15,039
good alternative for meat free diet

349
00:18:12,369 --> 00:18:20,229
people like yourself just yeah I like to

350
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:22,119
taste them so yeah I actually what

351
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:24,519
sparked this cuz I knew he were doing

352
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:26,259
this journey in doing these experiments

353
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:28,809
with various mushrooms and things like

354
00:18:26,259 --> 00:18:30,759
that I went over to my mother's house in

355
00:18:28,809 --> 00:18:32,710
Fort Lee Lowe and she had gone to the

356
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:37,410
local farmers market and picked up some

357
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:40,600
fresh oyster and they were phenomenal

358
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:43,240
her on them it was a little bit of a

359
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:45,789
meaty flavor almost right a little bit

360
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:49,299
like chicken but different I don't want

361
00:18:45,789 --> 00:18:52,690
people to think everything's like but it

362
00:18:49,299 --> 00:18:57,009
was good and so much healthier you know

363
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:59,230
just that other than the price because

364
00:18:57,009 --> 00:19:00,490
they were expensive oh yeah they were

365
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:02,289
they were great so it made me think

366
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:04,269
about ways I could start growing these

367
00:19:02,289 --> 00:19:06,059
at home and learning more about it

368
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:12,400
because I really I really did enjoy it

369
00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:16,509
the one one way is to use go over to a

370
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:20,800
Home Depot or whatever in place like

371
00:19:16,509 --> 00:19:23,349
that hole all murders flows and the tubs

372
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:25,659
their storage tubs the club the like

373
00:19:23,349 --> 00:19:29,980
Rubbermaid that kind of thing you could

374
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:34,330
use those even and we didn't pan out

375
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:36,130
then you know he'd still have a storage

376
00:19:34,329 --> 00:19:38,919
cover you know just mix oil or whatever

377
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:43,030
you know something like that but yeah

378
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:44,680
just you put substrate in there find a

379
00:19:43,029 --> 00:19:51,910
recipe that you're comfortable with that

380
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:54,310
makes sense to you and it's hard for me

381
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:57,640
to envision how anybody could really

382
00:19:54,309 --> 00:20:01,710
fail with something like the oyster

383
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:04,860
mushrooms they're just that easy to grow

384
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:08,298
okay it started a hundred years ago at

385
00:20:04,859 --> 00:20:12,418
after during World War one in Germany

386
00:20:08,298 --> 00:20:15,898
and out of necessity feed the people

387
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:19,140
and then after in the 20s and 30s it

388
00:20:15,898 --> 00:20:21,808
spread like wildfire throughout Asia so

389
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:26,340
that it became a it's a major crop in

390
00:20:21,808 --> 00:20:28,528
China and India because you can produce

391
00:20:26,339 --> 00:20:32,788
a lot of protein and you don't have to

392
00:20:28,528 --> 00:20:36,000
it's not like trying to grow an exotic

393
00:20:32,788 --> 00:20:37,919
plant like say orchids you're not gonna

394
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,470
break the bank we're talking about you

395
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:43,169
know growin mushrooms this is really

396
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:48,690
like a poor man's hobby which appealed

397
00:20:43,169 --> 00:20:51,809
to me you know I spent enough time and

398
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:53,700
effort money on growing and thinking I

399
00:20:51,808 --> 00:20:58,798
did to grow cannabis you know or

400
00:20:53,700 --> 00:21:00,899
something so this is really uh and it's

401
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:02,579
almost instantly you get you've seen the

402
00:21:00,898 --> 00:21:06,658
results of your work in a couple of

403
00:21:02,579 --> 00:21:09,000
weeks okay so I like you know so let's

404
00:21:06,659 --> 00:21:10,799
say I wanted to try going I stir

405
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,630
mushrooms I know you've talked a little

406
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:14,398
bit about this process all right you

407
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:16,169
said they're the easiest so take me

408
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:18,058
through all the steps from beginning to

409
00:21:16,169 --> 00:21:20,820
end you know like going to the website

410
00:21:18,058 --> 00:21:23,158
ordering this flooring what should I

411
00:21:20,819 --> 00:21:24,960
have at home before the spawn arrives

412
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:27,649
well you want to have your substrate

413
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:30,690
ready and the beauty is that

414
00:21:27,648 --> 00:21:34,048
commercially some of the things that are

415
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:37,288
used to grow oysters are really

416
00:21:34,048 --> 00:21:41,548
intriguing like I said you know a good

417
00:21:37,288 --> 00:21:47,308
friend Doug over at North West he was

418
00:21:41,548 --> 00:21:48,929
using newsprint and coffee grounds yeah

419
00:21:47,308 --> 00:21:51,658
I mean Wow

420
00:21:48,929 --> 00:21:54,778
and not only that not and not just

421
00:21:51,659 --> 00:22:02,549
getting one crop in one cycle you know

422
00:21:54,778 --> 00:22:04,558
what they call anyway is there like a pH

423
00:22:02,548 --> 00:22:06,329
range though so here's here's the thing

424
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:09,538
when you say coffee grounds in newsprint

425
00:22:06,329 --> 00:22:11,548
I think that's not gonna a very nutrient

426
00:22:09,538 --> 00:22:13,138
rich source for these mushrooms which

427
00:22:11,548 --> 00:22:14,908
makes me wonder if these mushrooms might

428
00:22:13,138 --> 00:22:15,609
be a little less nutritious than if I

429
00:22:14,909 --> 00:22:18,700
had grown the

430
00:22:15,609 --> 00:22:21,849
and it's in a higher hired nutritive

431
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:27,879
that's a really really good question and

432
00:22:21,849 --> 00:22:29,918
one that I can't give you a specific

433
00:22:27,878 --> 00:22:32,829
answer to but I have wondered the same

434
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:39,119
thing so one of the reason I bought the

435
00:22:32,829 --> 00:22:42,128
book organic mushroom farming is that

436
00:22:39,118 --> 00:22:45,009
that issue is addressed to some degree

437
00:22:42,128 --> 00:22:48,219
by instead okay remember when you first

438
00:22:45,009 --> 00:22:51,489
showed up at or we did I mean I'm about

439
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:53,259
the same time over it I see mag yeah I

440
00:22:51,489 --> 00:22:55,629
remember how much bad information there

441
00:22:53,259 --> 00:22:57,519
was okay sure

442
00:22:55,628 --> 00:23:00,849
oh well imagine that you'd been there

443
00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:03,700
ten years earlier okay about how bad it

444
00:23:00,849 --> 00:23:07,058
could have been well that's where the

445
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:10,179
mushroom forums are now I mean it's

446
00:23:07,058 --> 00:23:13,569
appalling I mean I read things like well

447
00:23:10,179 --> 00:23:17,470
yeah you want to add limestone because

448
00:23:13,569 --> 00:23:21,929
you need all those minerals let's see we

449
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:24,569
got calcium carbonate

450
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:27,650
what what exude treants are we talk I

451
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:30,509
mean if I want nutrients I use basalt

452
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:36,570
okay yeah something very nice is calcium

453
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:41,480
yeah you know I mean and kelp meal yeah

454
00:23:36,569 --> 00:23:44,009
probably the richest plant on the earth

455
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:46,440
so I have a kelp story to tell you but

456
00:23:44,009 --> 00:23:50,549
just just to simplify things so

457
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:52,170
basically you're saying for a substrate

458
00:23:50,549 --> 00:23:54,329
that that's what you have to have ready

459
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:55,910
and then you're recommending starting

460
00:23:54,329 --> 00:23:59,609
with something I think you mentioned

461
00:23:55,910 --> 00:24:01,830
rice hulls or yes that's your carbon

462
00:23:59,609 --> 00:24:04,109
source sure yeah that's your carbon for

463
00:24:01,829 --> 00:24:07,710
I mean you can use straw that's more

464
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:11,219
traditional Strife probably cheaper but

465
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:14,759
I live in you know the city and I got a

466
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:16,740
drive 15 miles to a feed store and then

467
00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:20,160
God knows how you know the whole Bureau

468
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:23,069
at least with the rice holes that I get

469
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:25,830
from concentrates are organic so cross

470
00:24:23,069 --> 00:24:28,529
your fingers you know with rice hulls I

471
00:24:25,829 --> 00:24:30,779
worry about arsenic levels potentially

472
00:24:28,529 --> 00:24:33,089
being an issue right from a heavy-metal

473
00:24:30,779 --> 00:24:35,339
perspective right let's just talk

474
00:24:33,089 --> 00:24:37,678
organic strawberry so let's try and find

475
00:24:35,339 --> 00:24:40,769
a source of organic straw you would in

476
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:42,660
the tub you would you heat the water to

477
00:24:40,769 --> 00:24:45,150
between a hundred one hundred eighty

478
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:49,590
degrees and keep it there for you said

479
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:51,929
at least an hour and 15 right to make

480
00:24:49,589 --> 00:24:54,569
sure that we've pasteurized it yes and

481
00:24:51,929 --> 00:24:56,690
then what happens then do you need to

482
00:24:54,569 --> 00:24:59,460
get the spot on it right away

483
00:24:56,690 --> 00:25:04,289
well what you think you're gonna uh you

484
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:10,590
want to drain and squeeze out is much

485
00:25:04,289 --> 00:25:13,259
like remember fungi are for many many

486
00:25:10,589 --> 00:25:17,069
decades it was taught at university is

487
00:25:13,259 --> 00:25:18,629
that fungi were a subset of the plant

488
00:25:17,069 --> 00:25:19,529
kingdom and we now know that's

489
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:21,840
ridiculous

490
00:25:19,529 --> 00:25:26,480
yeah they're closer to animals in this

491
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:29,730
regard they use oxygen and expel co2 so

492
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:32,759
you want that substrate like our soils

493
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:35,819
in this regard you want it moist but you

494
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:42,658
don't want it drenched

495
00:25:35,819 --> 00:25:47,158
and so what I do is I just get I got

496
00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:48,749
some 100% cotton pillowcases put this up

497
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:51,359
straight in there and just squeeze it

498
00:25:48,749 --> 00:25:53,159
and you know keep twisting and twist and

499
00:25:51,358 --> 00:25:55,739
get as much water and then let it hang

500
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:58,528
maybe for a day it's not no it's not

501
00:25:55,739 --> 00:26:02,569
like okay we got a rush I mean you want

502
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:05,519
to be take caution of course and then

503
00:26:02,569 --> 00:26:08,220
when you'll know the consistency you

504
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:11,159
want it so that it's what's that word we

505
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:13,379
use and so low me okay that's what

506
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:18,389
you're looking for so air passages and

507
00:26:13,378 --> 00:26:21,898
then you dump in your spawn which in the

508
00:26:18,388 --> 00:26:24,538
case of oysters they're probably I'm not

509
00:26:21,898 --> 00:26:28,048
sure what mr. Stannis is using but let's

510
00:26:24,538 --> 00:26:35,509
say it's chips wood chips or shavings or

511
00:26:28,048 --> 00:26:38,368
what have you I found it easier in my

512
00:26:35,509 --> 00:26:42,509
experiments to use organic sorghum or

513
00:26:38,368 --> 00:26:45,148
Milo whatever term and it's really

514
00:26:42,509 --> 00:26:47,190
inexpensive because it's it's a

515
00:26:45,148 --> 00:26:50,518
feedstock you probably feed it to your

516
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:53,759
chickens there it's part of the mix of

517
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:59,989
your chicken mash whatever it's called

518
00:26:53,759 --> 00:27:05,970
and because sorghum has a shell like

519
00:26:59,989 --> 00:27:10,220
corn popcorn if you will we have found

520
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:12,720
that to be easy to inoculate colonize

521
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:15,389
but yeah I mean you're kind of wide open

522
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:18,889
whatever so you're mixing that in with

523
00:27:15,388 --> 00:27:23,668
the straw yeah and then you're adding

524
00:27:18,888 --> 00:27:26,219
neem and kelp and rock dust to that yeah

525
00:27:23,669 --> 00:27:30,330
well I just sprinkle it in just a little

526
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:33,629
bit like about like what I did with soil

527
00:27:30,329 --> 00:27:38,668
you like say a cup of mean two cubic

528
00:27:33,628 --> 00:27:42,648
foot okay a cup of kelp now there's a

529
00:27:38,669 --> 00:27:42,649
funny that's an interesting one in

530
00:27:42,819 --> 00:27:50,109
studies that I downloaded from India

531
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:53,630
using neem and carranza not only did it

532
00:27:50,109 --> 00:27:57,349
suppress the contaminants as the term is

533
00:27:53,630 --> 00:28:00,980
used it increased the yield curve factor

534
00:27:57,349 --> 00:28:03,079
on the fruit that they were actually

535
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:07,490
wanting to grow in this case it was a

536
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:10,220
stirs and which sounds well if it's a

537
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:12,470
fungicide yeah but it's not a I want to

538
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:15,410
get into that whole thing it's like

539
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:23,350
silliest conversations in the cannabis

540
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:26,090
scene but so just out of Hawai night I

541
00:28:23,349 --> 00:28:30,740
started adding kelp or excuse me an

542
00:28:26,089 --> 00:28:32,539
email to the recipe the substrate and I

543
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:35,870
saw the same thing a suppression of

544
00:28:32,539 --> 00:28:40,039
contaminants and an increase in the

545
00:28:35,869 --> 00:28:43,339
yield of the the target fruit that we

546
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:45,170
were trying to see now one nice thing

547
00:28:43,339 --> 00:28:47,449
about oysters is they're they have a

548
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:49,910
very distinctive look so you can feel

549
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:51,769
pretty confident absolutely that you're

550
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:53,720
not getting something some contaminant

551
00:28:51,769 --> 00:28:55,250
in there well the contaminants are

552
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:59,360
usually that's kind of like soil

553
00:28:55,250 --> 00:29:02,839
remember we used to talk about on the

554
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:06,079
Cannabis boards that if you see the term

555
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:08,299
was mold I think if it's this color

556
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:11,449
you're fine if it's that color you're

557
00:29:08,299 --> 00:29:14,119
not so fine and so blues and greens you

558
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:16,940
don't want to see the white is you know

559
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:18,679
we're we're dancing right well it's the

560
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:21,410
same thing in the substrate you know you

561
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:24,080
start seeing green and just call it a

562
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:26,390
day and toss it oh they're talking about

563
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:27,889
mold it's not actual fruiting mushroom

564
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:30,890
caps you're saying if you see mold

565
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:32,180
growing in the yeah it's it all has to

566
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:35,060
do with color you're gonna you're gonna

567
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:37,070
see white which is what you want it's

568
00:29:35,059 --> 00:29:39,379
like just like in our soils we didn't

569
00:29:37,069 --> 00:29:42,529
want to see what Pink's blues and greens

570
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:44,990
memory serves me correct I only ever saw

571
00:29:42,529 --> 00:29:48,460
white so I'd never concerned myself yeah

572
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:50,630
do you have to poke holes in the

573
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:52,610
pillowcase or will it actually grow

574
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:56,150
right through the cotton oh no I just

575
00:29:52,609 --> 00:29:56,629
meant I use that to get as much water

576
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:58,460
out

577
00:29:56,630 --> 00:30:00,350
the substrate as possible so you're

578
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:03,319
growing it in you then put it into a tub

579
00:30:00,349 --> 00:30:06,469
yes and then I you drill some two inch

580
00:30:03,319 --> 00:30:12,019
holes for ventilation and use that tape

581
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:15,410
that if they use on bandages it you can

582
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:18,589
see through it but it has wilt like

583
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:22,220
microscopic type holes in it use that to

584
00:30:18,589 --> 00:30:26,509
cover that that blocks contaminants

585
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:32,299
getting into your tub okay they say I

586
00:30:26,509 --> 00:30:33,650
mean you bite it you know any by where

587
00:30:32,299 --> 00:30:36,169
you get your prescriptions you know

588
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:38,269
drugstore it's just that that tape you

589
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:40,160
use the wrap around your bandage how's

590
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:42,500
that you want your bandage to breathe

591
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:45,890
right like how that's tape or first-aid

592
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:48,380
tape yes at first aid yes yeah it's not

593
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:51,350
not the heavy-duty stuff just it's I

594
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:53,540
don't know three dollars for a three

595
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:55,099
hundred feet or something there okay so

596
00:30:53,539 --> 00:30:57,829
anyway you drill these two inch holes in

597
00:30:55,099 --> 00:31:01,879
it again we're back to fungi you need

598
00:30:57,829 --> 00:31:03,619
oxygen so you need good ventilation but

599
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:07,120
you don't want you want to have a way to

600
00:31:03,619 --> 00:31:09,289
block the bad guys from getting in there

601
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:13,729
yeah do you need to put a fan or

602
00:31:09,289 --> 00:31:15,829
anything on this no no I mean I've had

603
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:17,870
some other interesting ideas going into

604
00:31:15,829 --> 00:31:19,819
a Quarian store and looking at some of

605
00:31:17,869 --> 00:31:20,389
the stuff they used to create air

606
00:31:19,819 --> 00:31:23,509
bubbles

607
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:24,950
it was long skinny I'm thinking I said

608
00:31:23,509 --> 00:31:27,440
well you know he'd build a frame out of

609
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:29,900
those put that on the bottom with an

610
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,549
arrow I mean is this is open to a lot of

611
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:33,530
Investigation and the beauty is that

612
00:31:31,549 --> 00:31:36,009
it's not gonna break the bank it's not

613
00:31:33,529 --> 00:31:39,440
like let me try this thousand dollar

614
00:31:36,009 --> 00:31:41,960
super-duper light from you know we'd be

615
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,279
growing wheat or something and bite it

616
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:45,170
when I didn't work I didn't you know I

617
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:49,009
didn't pay off I mean this is like a

618
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:51,470
poor man's hobby I guess you can say so

619
00:31:49,009 --> 00:31:52,970
how long from the time you inoculate

620
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:55,069
this or into the straw and you get it

621
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:59,569
into the tub how long until we'll start

622
00:31:55,069 --> 00:32:01,490
seeing mushrooms with the oysters

623
00:31:59,569 --> 00:32:04,849
because of how and I mean this in a

624
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:07,309
positive way how invasive they are ten

625
00:32:04,849 --> 00:32:09,709
to twelve days and then it's just like

626
00:32:07,309 --> 00:32:10,509
you know you're cutting constantly and

627
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:12,640
getting

628
00:32:10,509 --> 00:32:13,629
I mean this thing goes on for several

629
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:18,370
weeks that's why

630
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:20,110
so the you don't really grow cannabis

631
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:22,209
you know you're looking at three months

632
00:32:20,109 --> 00:32:25,750
before well how do you know how to pan

633
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:27,309
out how'd those seeds work right well

634
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:29,140
you don't have that here I mean this is

635
00:32:27,309 --> 00:32:30,309
like instant gratification almost

636
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:33,280
they're as close as you can get to

637
00:32:30,309 --> 00:32:36,009
instant gratification yeah that's and

638
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:38,740
the other thing is with the oysters

639
00:32:36,009 --> 00:32:41,500
sometimes when you're bored look at the

640
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:44,380
variety there's like 22 major varieties

641
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:46,180
and some of them are just I mean they're

642
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:48,160
pieces of art you could hire a

643
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:50,410
professional photographer and shoot them

644
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:53,650
and sell postcards of it I mean some of

645
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:58,390
the exotic blues and pinks and all kinds

646
00:32:53,650 --> 00:33:00,970
of neat colors there's something like I

647
00:32:58,390 --> 00:33:02,259
believe I'm quoting Paul Stamets oh I

648
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:07,539
want to be careful here at all I'm

649
00:33:02,259 --> 00:33:13,170
misquote but something like 15,000

650
00:33:07,539 --> 00:33:20,109
specific varieties of fungi that are

651
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:22,930
cultivated either by intent or you know

652
00:33:20,109 --> 00:33:29,079
what have you and the amount that

653
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:32,580
freaked is fairly limited I mean for

654
00:33:29,079 --> 00:33:36,730
example morels

655
00:33:32,579 --> 00:33:39,879
everybody likes morels right that's

656
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:41,620
actually the fruit of ecto micro hazel

657
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:45,460
that's why we get them at the base of

658
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:48,639
trees that's the fruit from that variety

659
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:52,779
of fungi I just found that really

660
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:57,520
fascinating and some grow in decomposing

661
00:33:52,779 --> 00:34:00,730
logs on the ground some grow on living

662
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:03,879
trees like reishi you that's where you

663
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:07,000
ought to find those and when you buy

664
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:11,890
like say logs that are already pre

665
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:18,219
inoculated the big one is the ones from

666
00:34:11,889 --> 00:34:21,909
Japan shiitake yeah so you get this log

667
00:34:18,219 --> 00:34:24,069
it's a for a disc discussion we'll call

668
00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:26,500
it sawdust

669
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:30,550
Hill together bound by a resin of some

670
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:35,110
type that's been inoculated with the

671
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:37,690
spores and so it's a one-time use but

672
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:40,210
that's an easy way to get started - just

673
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:42,099
for the gratification part of it you

674
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:45,280
order it and they're not expensive see

675
00:34:42,099 --> 00:34:48,460
order a log and you grow some mushrooms

676
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:50,139
or and it just gives you a sense of

677
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:53,648
accomplishment well I did this you know

678
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:55,530
so that then leads you to some that

679
00:34:53,648 --> 00:34:57,699
maybe are a little bit more challenging

680
00:34:55,530 --> 00:35:00,730
yeah I think that's what I'm gonna start

681
00:34:57,699 --> 00:35:02,559
with here there's a local guy who makes

682
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:04,809
them he makes a few different products

683
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:08,110
and so I can get the logs from him oh

684
00:35:04,809 --> 00:35:10,809
absolutely I mean you're up there that's

685
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:13,090
why Paul Stamets is domiciled up there

686
00:35:10,809 --> 00:35:20,440
I mean vasilich North West is one of the

687
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:22,990
epicenters of well let's use the word

688
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:26,139
mushroom foraging how's that there's

689
00:35:22,989 --> 00:35:28,929
just a lot of opportunities many were

690
00:35:26,139 --> 00:35:31,960
native and some were brought it you know

691
00:35:28,929 --> 00:35:35,859
just to sort of the human race moving

692
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:38,079
around and things but yeah that would be

693
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:40,809
if you know somebody that's putting

694
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:42,219
together into shitake blogs that would

695
00:35:40,809 --> 00:35:44,650
be way cool just to have it in your

696
00:35:42,219 --> 00:35:47,279
store yeah and people come in to look

697
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:51,970
what I did you know kind of thing and

698
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:55,570
yeah we had one actually set up and this

699
00:35:51,969 --> 00:35:57,609
is funny so one night our security alarm

700
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:59,230
started going off and we couldn't figure

701
00:35:57,610 --> 00:36:01,180
out what it was the whole thing was

702
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:05,710
covered there was movement inside our

703
00:36:01,179 --> 00:36:10,029
farm store turns out what had caused it

704
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:13,480
was one of the mushroom logs had

705
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:16,870
released spores and in a hoofed and then

706
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:19,480
the spores had hit the camera well past

707
00:36:16,869 --> 00:36:22,119
the alert to go off so we went down

708
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:23,800
there was no one there but we figured

709
00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:25,019
out after the fact that we'd put the

710
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:27,820
mushroom lock too close to the camera

711
00:36:25,019 --> 00:36:33,190
yeah I mean there's I've seen some

712
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:35,700
videos of time-lapse yeah it's the most

713
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:37,139
fascinating

714
00:36:35,699 --> 00:36:38,429
it's the

715
00:36:37,139 --> 00:36:44,068
has anything that I've ever been

716
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:47,489
involved in is this Lucas learning about

717
00:36:44,068 --> 00:36:51,150
especially for myself was medicinal

718
00:36:47,489 --> 00:36:52,979
mushrooms the the cordyceps and the

719
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:55,619
lion's mane it would actually though the

720
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:58,139
Lions meow there's one for you if you

721
00:36:55,619 --> 00:37:00,028
get and you can find them here in the

722
00:36:58,139 --> 00:37:02,848
northwest because this is foodie central

723
00:37:00,028 --> 00:37:06,119
right Seattle in Portland so you get

724
00:37:02,849 --> 00:37:08,789
take fresh lion's mane you cut them into

725
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:10,588
steaks and then you treat it like

726
00:37:08,789 --> 00:37:13,920
lobster or crab and that's what it

727
00:37:10,588 --> 00:37:15,949
tastes like just spread some butter on

728
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:18,900
it with some herbs and then grill it I

729
00:37:15,949 --> 00:37:20,639
mean what a great what a great you say

730
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:23,010
you and your wife are having a dinner

731
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:26,879
party you want to impress people well

00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:29,940
here's a non meat meal that I've

733
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:36,260
prepared for you and you could do some

734
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:38,579
things with well maitake would ear

735
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:41,130
moister 'z I mean you can really create

736
00:37:38,579 --> 00:37:44,250
some really wonderful now where I come

737
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:46,650
in is I'm a real big bread baker yeah so

738
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:51,329
I like making artists and pizza dough's

739
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:53,670
and then using mushrooms on that not

740
00:37:51,329 --> 00:37:56,430
with a ton of cheese either the you know

741
00:37:53,670 --> 00:38:01,200
you want the flavors to come through of

742
00:37:56,429 --> 00:38:03,719
these wonderful things that we grew in

743
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:07,318
our gardens but I could see it like at

744
00:38:03,719 --> 00:38:10,919
your farm having like an exhibit area

745
00:38:07,318 --> 00:38:13,318
for the children to see mushrooms

746
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:16,588
growing and how they're harvested and

747
00:38:13,318 --> 00:38:18,389
then might even turn into a profit

748
00:38:16,588 --> 00:38:19,889
Center you know I can have company pick

749
00:38:18,389 --> 00:38:22,259
a mushroom or something you know well

750
00:38:19,889 --> 00:38:23,818
yeah we've tried inoculating some logs

751
00:38:22,259 --> 00:38:26,068
but we didn't have any one that was

752
00:38:23,818 --> 00:38:28,048
really staying with it it makes bright

753
00:38:26,068 --> 00:38:30,929
success right I think that's important

754
00:38:28,048 --> 00:38:33,298
with any living organism so I'm hoping

755
00:38:30,929 --> 00:38:33,768
to try again once we get the farm you

756
00:38:33,298 --> 00:38:35,759
know

757
00:38:33,768 --> 00:38:38,578
well you're right you're right around

758
00:38:35,759 --> 00:38:42,599
the corner from Paul and his operation

759
00:38:38,579 --> 00:38:44,430
so you know picking up the I don't know

760
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:45,660
if he has will call or whatever but even

761
00:38:44,429 --> 00:38:48,989
shipping you're gonna have it there the

762
00:38:45,659 --> 00:38:51,149
next day and he's and his staff are

763
00:38:48,989 --> 00:38:55,619
really good about answering

764
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:57,869
questions and I mean I might even learn

765
00:38:55,619 --> 00:38:59,339
to the substrate business I got a couple

766
00:38:57,869 --> 00:39:03,630
guys that I would be interested in

767
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:05,250
talking to you yeah yeah my wife and I

768
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:07,440
have been taking the lion's mane and a

769
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:09,989
few of the other prodigy all Stamets his

770
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:11,519
company they've been they've been great

771
00:39:09,989 --> 00:39:16,649
it feels good to take something that's

772
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:23,389
healthy and safe yes yes I use it I buy

773
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:26,160
a different product but he he worked for

774
00:39:23,389 --> 00:39:28,679
cost ounces an extractor for over a year

775
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:32,519
and then set up his own business down in

776
00:39:28,679 --> 00:39:34,949
Ashland yeah in Southern Oregon and he's

777
00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:37,559
got one product all his products are

778
00:39:34,949 --> 00:39:40,049
fifty dollars a pound and so your

779
00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:41,909
prescription or the dosage is four grams

780
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:46,800
a day so that's a hundred and ten days

781
00:39:41,909 --> 00:39:49,440
worth a pound I mean for $50 it's

782
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:51,330
cheaper than supplements and yeah pawpaw

783
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,889
stuffs is expensive but fortunately we

784
00:39:51,329 --> 00:39:56,369
had a wholesale account because sure

785
00:39:52,889 --> 00:39:57,509
were retail establishments so we a lot

786
00:39:56,369 --> 00:40:00,719
of a staff and stuff we'll get an

787
00:39:57,510 --> 00:40:03,330
employee discount is able to sure the

788
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:06,659
one he the general I can't remember his

789
00:40:03,329 --> 00:40:10,069
name but anyway he has one that's ten

790
00:40:06,659 --> 00:40:13,109
varieties and they're different

791
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:15,870
primarily I don't we shouldn't have said

792
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:18,269
that but a lot is from China and have

793
00:40:15,869 --> 00:40:21,469
they used in traditional Chinese

794
00:40:18,269 --> 00:40:25,199
medicine for centuries grown here just

795
00:40:21,469 --> 00:40:28,349

Thank You Carrie okay here you go

00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:04,349
apothecary right like you in Chinatown

806
00:41:00,659 --> 00:41:04,949
that you'd see in Portland OR sale so I

807
00:41:04,349 --> 00:41:07,319
gave a

808
00:41:04,949 --> 00:41:11,039
us to all the Chinese names I said see

809
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:14,369
if you can get these dried and then we

810
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:15,750
can do I'm this isn't as complicated as

811
00:41:14,369 --> 00:41:22,640
I'm making it sound but we can do a

812
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:22,639
Jurassic Park thing and get that those

813
00:41:23,269 --> 00:41:29,730
those spores are reactivated so that we

814
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:30,900
can produce them and grow them yeah but

815
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:32,579
like some of the ones they're really

816
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:37,769
beautiful mushrooms like turkey tail

817
00:41:32,579 --> 00:41:40,200
that's a big medicinal one and cordyceps

818
00:41:37,769 --> 00:41:43,829
which is written those fascinating of

819
00:41:40,199 --> 00:41:46,019
all um I think that's the one that will

820
00:41:43,829 --> 00:41:50,130
actually eat insects that's correct

821
00:41:46,019 --> 00:41:53,550
or it's the zombie yeah yeah yeah

822
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:55,619
because it will cause them to act it

823
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:57,660
actually affects their neural function

824
00:41:55,619 --> 00:42:01,740
that's great it's tough it's really

825
00:41:57,659 --> 00:42:03,719
fascinating yeah and yeah when you get

826
00:42:01,739 --> 00:42:05,189
into the world it's like what's really

827
00:42:03,719 --> 00:42:07,980
cool about it is it hasn't been

828
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:14,550
bastardized yeah and I don't know that

829
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:19,460
it can because my ecology is a is a

830
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:19,460
really big universe to go play in and

831
00:42:20,088 --> 00:42:26,670
there just aren't that many Paul Stamets

832
00:42:22,469 --> 00:42:30,088
around that's the reality of it yeah are

833
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:35,369
people who can explain the big picture

834
00:42:30,088 --> 00:42:42,630
as well as he does and so you're not

835
00:42:35,369 --> 00:42:48,390
gonna see well you're never gonna see a

836
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:50,608
canna con for mycologist okay okay yeah

837
00:42:48,389 --> 00:42:53,129
you're not gonna have there's a song

838
00:42:50,608 --> 00:42:55,980
from it like almost 55 years ago from

839
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:57,990
the Rolling Stone and the title of it

840
00:42:55,980 --> 00:43:00,630
you know it's all you need to hear is

841
00:42:57,989 --> 00:43:02,939
it's the west coast under assist the

842
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:06,420
under assistant West Coast promotion man

843
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:08,760
and that's what I was looking at an

844
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:10,470
upcoming event in Portland in August

845
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:12,020
like who is going to be there and it's

846
00:43:10,469 --> 00:43:16,279
the first thing I thought it was that

847
00:43:12,019 --> 00:43:16,280
song by the really you know button-down

848
00:43:16,608 --> 00:43:21,469
you know selling the dream but I don't

849
00:43:19,849 --> 00:43:25,999
think that that is there really going to

850
00:43:21,469 --> 00:43:27,108
at least and well my life I may be in

851
00:43:25,998 --> 00:43:32,178
your electrum I don't think you're gonna

852
00:43:27,108 --> 00:43:34,159
see that happening it would be it would

853
00:43:32,179 --> 00:43:35,809
be I would really blow my mind if it did

854
00:43:34,159 --> 00:43:38,868
that you would see that the whole thing

855
00:43:35,809 --> 00:43:41,239
would get turned on its head yeah yeah

856
00:43:38,869 --> 00:43:42,588
well who knows I mean cannabis sure has

857
00:43:41,239 --> 00:43:44,630
changed in your lifetime quite

858
00:43:42,588 --> 00:43:46,458
dramatically you know it's really funny

859
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:49,130
is that I was thinking about this the

860
00:43:46,458 --> 00:43:53,748
other day in a conversation with a

861
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:56,420
friend we go back to when Lyndon Johnson

862
00:43:53,748 --> 00:44:00,169
was president okay as far as their

863
00:43:56,420 --> 00:44:04,909
friendship so we were there before it

864
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:07,909
started I mean on this level they're you

865
00:44:04,909 --> 00:44:09,170
know just 70 people lighting up or

866
00:44:07,909 --> 00:44:13,518
whatever you know we're supposed to say

867
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:14,719
getting stoned and so I you know we

868
00:44:13,518 --> 00:44:18,048
lived through the whole thing and

869
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:22,880
watched it morph into what it whatever

870
00:44:18,048 --> 00:44:25,518
it is you know now and it just boggles

871
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:31,818
my mind that and one year prices could

872
00:44:25,518 --> 00:44:34,058
drop 80% I just I mean there used to be

873
00:44:31,818 --> 00:44:38,119
a time where you could grow some pounds

874
00:44:34,059 --> 00:44:39,709
you know you shuffle them off for 3,200

875
00:44:38,119 --> 00:44:47,088
and you know it was a nice little edge

876
00:44:39,708 --> 00:44:48,978
unto your income I suppose but not

877
00:44:47,088 --> 00:44:54,170
probably as many as you have I've been

878
00:44:48,978 --> 00:44:57,318
to a few wreck farms or were you gonna

879
00:44:54,170 --> 00:45:00,289
call him yeah and my first thought was

880
00:44:57,318 --> 00:45:03,438
man you guys are in trouble that's a lot

881
00:45:00,289 --> 00:45:06,679
of plants I mean look what are you

882
00:45:03,438 --> 00:45:11,149
thinking you know I mean I would want to

883
00:45:06,679 --> 00:45:16,338
grow 4,000 tomato plants without a big

884
00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:19,160
crew and I don't know scaling is a

885
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:19,849
definite is a definite challenge that we

886
00:45:19,159 --> 00:45:23,438
deal with

887
00:45:19,849 --> 00:45:23,439
I still like dealing with people that

888
00:45:24,789 --> 00:45:31,278
you know spits in the sunshine and

889
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:33,858
I'm just an old curmudgeon I don't buy

890
00:45:31,278 --> 00:45:37,250
into this garbage about no indoors the

891
00:45:33,858 --> 00:45:42,380
best station that isn't but you know he

892
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:45,588
is afraid of being high you know when I

893
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:49,068
started when I started when I started on

894
00:45:45,588 --> 00:45:53,150
this journey my first crop went to

895
00:45:49,068 --> 00:45:56,750
ground 43 years ago and the word

896
00:45:53,150 --> 00:46:01,130
sensimilla hadn't even been popularized

897
00:45:56,750 --> 00:46:06,670
yet so we didn't know we were done just

898
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:10,700
you know got and chop down some weed man

899
00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:14,088
and the scene straight out of Thailand

900
00:46:10,699 --> 00:46:19,489
and India and Sri Lanka what-have-you

901
00:46:14,088 --> 00:46:22,130
and then it started in late seventies

902
00:46:19,489 --> 00:46:27,139
early 80s the name game started out of

903
00:46:22,130 --> 00:46:31,990
California course all these wacky names

904
00:46:27,139 --> 00:46:35,618
and then in the late 80s when the two

905
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:39,528
first of the two major seed companies

906
00:46:35,619 --> 00:46:43,759
today what you would know as sensi seeds

907
00:46:39,528 --> 00:46:48,789
was they had a catalog called the SSS C

908
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:52,940
super sativa C Club and in their

909
00:46:48,789 --> 00:46:54,559
listings they gave credit to several

910
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:57,889
seeds that came out of the Northwest

911
00:46:54,559 --> 00:46:59,809
from a group called sacred seeds there

912
00:46:57,889 --> 00:47:02,358
was a reason that Williams wonder will

913
00:46:59,809 --> 00:47:05,630
look on a map and Williams organ and

914
00:47:02,358 --> 00:47:10,598
wonder organ on the opposite side of a

915
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:13,450
valley downs of it are the main one of

916
00:47:10,599 --> 00:47:15,588
their would he call it I guess the

917
00:47:13,449 --> 00:47:18,558
forerunner of any of their strains is

918
00:47:15,588 --> 00:47:21,018
the Afghani hashtag one number one

919
00:47:18,559 --> 00:47:23,119
Afghani number one well that was one and

920
00:47:21,018 --> 00:47:24,469
they this is they're giving him credit

921
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:28,068
and they're Catholic so obviously it's

922
00:47:24,469 --> 00:47:32,739
true they bought that from sacred seeds

923
00:47:28,068 --> 00:47:36,170
and then the other big catalog was I

924
00:47:32,739 --> 00:47:38,568
can't think of his name but anyway the

925
00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:41,170
seed bank and he hooked up with Sam

926
00:47:38,568 --> 00:47:43,099
skunk man so that's where you got the

927
00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:45,680
haze

928
00:47:43,099 --> 00:47:48,499
and Northern Lights came out of British

929
00:47:45,679 --> 00:47:51,379
Columbia the BCG a British Columbia

930
00:47:48,498 --> 00:47:57,199
Growers Association and that whole thing

931
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:58,940
but that's when I saw it changing we

932
00:47:57,199 --> 00:48:01,489
don't want all those imports man we can

933
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:02,960
no we'll make it better because I know

934
00:48:01,489 --> 00:48:05,358
this guy that's got this really cool

935
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:07,999
I'll fill in the blank and I can cross

936
00:48:05,358 --> 00:48:10,759
it with my fill in the blank and then

937
00:48:07,998 --> 00:48:13,058
the seed thing was on I never imagined

938
00:48:10,759 --> 00:48:16,338
that it would get the insanity that a

939
00:48:13,059 --> 00:48:21,650
mate Peyton Manning push I mean really

940
00:48:16,338 --> 00:48:26,119
if Obama push I mean come on and I'm

941
00:48:21,650 --> 00:48:30,470
looking at a book right now that one of

942
00:48:26,119 --> 00:48:33,229
the authors is Victoria Hayes I'd like

943
00:48:30,469 --> 00:48:36,919
to see the birth certificate on that

944
00:48:33,228 --> 00:48:44,509
before I buy into that one hmm but you

945
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:48,588
know you know i mean the whole grabbing

946
00:48:44,509 --> 00:48:53,119
people's genetics and in a copyright or

947
00:48:48,588 --> 00:48:55,248
whatever that scam is like you know if

948
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:57,619
somebody actually I had about four

949
00:48:55,248 --> 00:48:59,358
people tell you know they got some of

950
00:48:57,619 --> 00:49:04,130
your genetics and I said yes a lot of

951
00:48:59,358 --> 00:49:06,170
cares I don't care you know doesn't mean

952
00:49:04,130 --> 00:49:08,778
anything he'll get bastardize or the

953
00:49:06,170 --> 00:49:10,690
first person that buys it because you

954
00:49:08,778 --> 00:49:16,670
know I got this guy he's got just a

955
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:18,349
special cush from Anna wherever got

956
00:49:16,670 --> 00:49:20,869
pimple Texas man you know we're gonna

957
00:49:18,349 --> 00:49:22,789
cross that and make it super strange I'm

958
00:49:20,869 --> 00:49:25,278
still waiting for that super extreme but

959
00:49:22,789 --> 00:49:27,499
you know so far I retired from the

960
00:49:25,278 --> 00:49:29,960
business and said yeah okay it didn't

961
00:49:27,498 --> 00:49:33,199
happen I've been waiting for 40 years

962
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:37,239
but I haven't seen it yet I still don't

963
00:49:33,199 --> 00:49:37,239
I don't believe that American breeders

964
00:49:37,298 --> 00:49:41,478
for and not a criticism just a statement

965
00:49:40,670 --> 00:49:44,180
of fact

966
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:47,689
will ever hit the levels of several

967
00:49:44,179 --> 00:49:50,298
hundred years of hand selected seeds

968
00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:53,179
from places like Sri Lanka and Thailand

969
00:49:50,298 --> 00:49:55,728
and other places that's all we don't

970
00:49:53,179 --> 00:49:57,129
have that sense of longevity or in terms

971
00:49:55,728 --> 00:50:00,349
of

972
00:49:57,130 --> 00:50:04,010
seeing the big picture it's all about

973
00:50:00,349 --> 00:50:08,599
immediate results you know okay here's

974
00:50:04,010 --> 00:50:11,120
an example one of the biggest developers

975
00:50:08,599 --> 00:50:15,039
of dahlias is here in Oregon the Dahlia

976
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:17,299
farm down near a few miles south of me

977
00:50:15,039 --> 00:50:18,980
and I go to this show every year and the

978
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:20,930
family's been growing dahlias and breed

979
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:24,139
them since the twenty Sol's you know

980
00:50:20,929 --> 00:50:27,349
ninety over 90 years and I'm talking to

981
00:50:24,139 --> 00:50:29,599
one of this grandsons or whatever and he

982
00:50:27,349 --> 00:50:32,269
was telling me this took seven years you

983
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:35,029
know to develop this and this one you

984
00:50:32,269 --> 00:50:36,619
know blah blah blah I said ah man you to

985
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:39,530
get some weed growers in here and these

986
00:50:36,619 --> 00:50:42,139
guys can crank out a a new strain and

987
00:50:39,530 --> 00:50:44,420
matter of a month or two so you need you

988
00:50:42,139 --> 00:50:48,170
need to pick up the pace and he just

989
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:53,210
shook his head he said yeah whatever I'm

990
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:57,889
just saying that you know there's I I

991
00:50:53,210 --> 00:51:04,309
don't sense this what are we gonna leave

992
00:50:57,889 --> 00:51:08,589
the next generation you know 200 pushes

993
00:51:04,309 --> 00:51:10,820
I don't know or or whatever they are

994
00:51:08,590 --> 00:51:15,519
yeah well there's this the idea now that

995
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:19,330
using you know science science we can

996
00:51:15,519 --> 00:51:22,670
and genetic markers we could identify

997
00:51:19,329 --> 00:51:25,819
within a particular strain or cultivar

998
00:51:22,670 --> 00:51:27,740
varietal what you know say for example

999
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:31,519
that specific marker that's associated

1000
00:51:27,739 --> 00:51:34,489
with helping with epilepsy so reducing

1001
00:51:31,519 --> 00:51:38,090
genes if we can identify that and we can

1002
00:51:34,489 --> 00:51:41,659
increase the you know the particular

1003
00:51:38,090 --> 00:51:43,340
cannabinoid that helps with that and we

1004
00:51:41,659 --> 00:51:46,250
can grow out you know 200 different

1005
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:49,370
phenotypes and identify within seven

1006
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:51,849
days if it's male/female what what

1007
00:51:49,369 --> 00:51:55,039
percent of that marker it's going to

1008
00:51:51,849 --> 00:51:59,779
it's going to Express then we can really

1009
00:51:55,039 --> 00:52:01,880
quickly make decisions and and and make

1010
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:04,670
changes that would have taken a regular

1011
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:07,940
grower you know generation and cycle and

1012
00:52:04,670 --> 00:52:10,690
cycle the to actually know so that to me

1013
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:13,088
is both scary and exciting

1014
00:52:10,690 --> 00:52:15,009
but I hear what you're saying and I do

1015
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:16,599
agree with you that we like we don't

1016
00:52:15,009 --> 00:52:19,440
have the same relationship with this

1017
00:52:16,599 --> 00:52:23,440
plant that we that these you know

1018
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:26,019
indigenous cultures that the treat it

1019
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:28,329
like sacred medicine had and that they

1020
00:52:26,018 --> 00:52:30,189
did there was I think much more

1021
00:52:28,329 --> 00:52:31,960
spiritual and I don't want to just throw

1022
00:52:30,190 --> 00:52:35,639
that out it's not I don't think the

1023
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:38,380
cannabis plant is just a chemo var or

1024
00:52:35,639 --> 00:52:41,739
you know a particular expression of

1025
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:43,960
these chemicals there's more to it than

1026
00:52:41,739 --> 00:52:45,879
that you know and maybe that's just the

1027
00:52:43,960 --> 00:53:03,548
spiritual side of me thank you

1028
00:52:45,880 --> 00:53:06,329
no I know it's it's look we've had what

1029
00:53:03,548 --> 00:53:10,768
eighty-two years of insanity since the

1030
00:53:06,329 --> 00:53:14,009
1937 law was passed at the urging of

1031
00:53:10,768 --> 00:53:19,959
DuPont and other big chemical companies

1032
00:53:14,009 --> 00:53:25,059
and you know the campaign politically

1033
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:29,710
publicly has been it's Obama it's just

1034
00:53:25,059 --> 00:53:33,400
it's it's unreal all I'm suggesting is

1035
00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:38,349
is that the deal that started in the

1036
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:42,099
late 80s with this you know there's

1037
00:53:38,349 --> 00:53:45,249
something magical about my strains

1038
00:53:42,099 --> 00:53:49,499
better than your string I think was to

1039
00:53:45,248 --> 00:53:54,459
the detriment of the plant itself and I

1040
00:53:49,498 --> 00:53:56,379
used to have a tagline on might when we

1041
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:59,829
were before social media when we were

1042
00:53:56,380 --> 00:54:01,568
doing forums you know once you take the

1043
00:53:59,829 --> 00:54:06,579
whoop down to a chihuahua there's no

1044
00:54:01,568 --> 00:54:09,940
going back and I kind of think that's a

1045
00:54:06,579 --> 00:54:11,890
little bit where we're at well no that's

1046
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:15,608
a lot where we're at it Tomatoes why is

1047
00:54:11,889 --> 00:54:20,318
it that we want to grow heirlooms well

1048
00:54:15,608 --> 00:54:23,019
we want flavor and color and and robust

1049
00:54:20,318 --> 00:54:25,690
plant right yeah we're sick

1050
00:54:23,019 --> 00:54:28,329
Roma's and tomatoes on the vine as they

1051
00:54:25,690 --> 00:54:30,579
call it you know this man right in the

1052
00:54:28,329 --> 00:54:32,980
store that store yeah yeah you know they

1053
00:54:30,579 --> 00:54:34,750
last the longest well I was in the

1054
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:36,699
produce industry for several years and

1055
00:54:34,750 --> 00:54:40,059
yeah your biggest concern is what they

1056
00:54:36,699 --> 00:54:40,859
call legs from the time we pick it how

1057
00:54:40,059 --> 00:54:42,880
long

1058
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:47,170
optimum time to get it into a

1059
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:49,960
distribution center you know and so you

1060
00:54:47,170 --> 00:54:55,450
were probably uninterested hopefully but

1061
00:54:49,960 --> 00:55:00,070
in the 90s Calgene was a big project

1062
00:54:55,449 --> 00:55:02,859
that involve Monsanto UC Davis and they

1063
00:55:00,070 --> 00:55:06,990
were going to create the tomato that had

1064
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:12,269
the longest shelf life or something by

1065
00:55:06,989 --> 00:55:16,179
replacing one of the DNA or RNA whatever

1066
00:55:12,269 --> 00:55:20,039
from using a potato so as they were just

1067
00:55:16,179 --> 00:55:26,349
stumbling around with genetic modified

1068
00:55:20,039 --> 00:55:29,019
plants and the publicity against it and

1069
00:55:26,349 --> 00:55:32,920
the media it just killed the project I

1070
00:55:29,019 --> 00:55:36,730
mean look up calgene sometime and it was

1071
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:42,220
a mess and it was a harbinger of things

1072
00:55:36,730 --> 00:55:47,469
to come I think I don't want to eat

1073
00:55:42,219 --> 00:55:50,579
frankenfood I just trust the people at

1074
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:53,709
Monsanto as much as I do law enforcement

1075
00:55:50,579 --> 00:55:56,289
you know I don't need your goodwill I

1076
00:55:53,710 --> 00:55:59,019
can figure this out I know where to get

1077
00:55:56,289 --> 00:56:05,079
Tomatoes seeds

1078
00:55:59,019 --> 00:56:10,449
I don't need your garbage and what the

1079
00:56:05,079 --> 00:56:12,069
average consumers walking into what's

1080
00:56:10,449 --> 00:56:20,500
that there's a lot there's a line from a

1081
00:56:12,070 --> 00:56:23,109
song by Grace Slick that said I don't

1082
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:27,130
care if my lettuce has DDT on it as long

1083
00:56:23,108 --> 00:56:29,380
as it's crisp okay and that's kind of

1084
00:56:27,130 --> 00:56:31,480
where we're at as a society well yeah

1085
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:32,980
but the tomatoes are so pretty well yeah

1086
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:35,769
you see those lights he put in there

1087
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:36,820
that hit you know this the special

1088
00:56:35,769 --> 00:56:43,480
lighting the

1089
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:45,070
look and so it's frankenfood and all you

1090
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:49,389
need to do is go to a mall and look at

1091
00:56:45,070 --> 00:56:50,260
the level of obesity that has struck our

1092
00:56:49,389 --> 00:56:55,000
children

1093
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:56,770
I mean diabete to diabetes used to be an

1094
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:00,760
old person's disease that's what you got

1095
00:56:56,769 --> 00:57:01,539
like in your 50s or 60s from well being

1096
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:07,300
a [ __ ]

1097
00:57:01,539 --> 00:57:08,469
you know drinking too much yeah I laugh

1098
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:11,289
at that because I know you're battling

1099
00:57:08,469 --> 00:57:12,609
at my dad's battling it so I think well

1100
00:57:11,289 --> 00:57:14,800
yeah I mean you know we didn't make good

1101
00:57:12,610 --> 00:57:15,460
decisions you know I mean let's get

1102
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:20,769
honest here

1103
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:24,789
but to see children it's not just talk

1104
00:57:20,769 --> 00:57:28,090
they've locked 2025 years off their life

1105
00:57:24,789 --> 00:57:31,929
expectancy and I think that's just

1106
00:57:28,090 --> 00:57:35,170
horrible and you know if we treated our

1107
00:57:31,929 --> 00:57:37,269
dogs like we treat our children we'd be

1108
00:57:35,170 --> 00:57:39,880
arrested if you gave a dog a cup of

1109
00:57:37,269 --> 00:57:41,500
coffee and uh you know Winchell's donuts

1110
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:43,030
the morning for breakfast

1111
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:45,940
somebody had probably come in arrest you

1112
00:57:43,030 --> 00:57:48,370
for ld2 animals but you know you do it

1113
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:52,500
we put you know cook machines in our

1114
00:57:48,369 --> 00:57:57,849
schools how are you gonna have a

1115
00:57:52,500 --> 00:58:00,760
thriving human being with all that junk

1116
00:57:57,849 --> 00:58:02,500
going in their bodies from the time they

1117
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:04,780
get up til they go to bed oh and then

1118
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:07,840
that's add in the let's sit in front of

1119
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:12,190
and play whatever the latest in a

1120
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:19,120
computer game is on there or worse or

1121
00:58:12,190 --> 00:58:20,800
worse now we'll know you have to walk

1122
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:23,289
you can walk around with your phone and

1123
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:26,560
play you know I don't even know the

1124
00:58:23,289 --> 00:58:31,300
games anywhere so I don't really care

1125
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:35,289
what those fungi I think fungi will

1126
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:37,870
bring I yeah I know it sounds corny to

1127
00:58:35,289 --> 00:58:43,029
some but I tomorrow delved into this

1128
00:58:37,869 --> 00:58:46,659
over the last two or three years I agree

1129
00:58:43,030 --> 00:58:50,750
with Paul Stamets that if fungi will be

1130
00:58:46,659 --> 00:58:53,029
what saves the human race from it so I

1131
00:58:50,750 --> 00:58:55,510
that I sincerely believe and like your

1132
00:58:53,030 --> 00:59:00,950
you just had the experience of eating

1133
00:58:55,510 --> 00:59:03,380
fresh oysters the other day that would

1134
00:59:00,949 --> 00:59:06,079
not be a hard diet to acclimate yourself

1135
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:09,280
to I mean you could say you know I could

1136
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:12,199
do without me if I could have this

1137
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:15,530
quality of protein yeah I could see

1138
00:59:12,199 --> 00:59:20,809
moving towards our plant it's not a plan

1139
00:59:15,530 --> 00:59:22,400
to get my idea an on meat diet yeah and

1140
00:59:20,809 --> 00:59:24,608
I think I think it has a really big

1141
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:27,820
important role to play I can know like

1142
00:59:24,608 --> 00:59:31,848
from your own experience that taking the

1143
00:59:27,820 --> 00:59:34,340
taking but using the oysters excuse me

1144
00:59:31,849 --> 00:59:36,680
the lion's mane and and whichever ones

1145
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:39,769
you choose the cordyceps like I said it

1146
00:59:36,679 --> 00:59:44,358
might my recipe that I get is equal

1147
00:59:39,769 --> 00:59:46,608
parts by volume or weight well I'm not

1148
00:59:44,358 --> 00:59:48,710
sure it doesn't matter anyway Rishi

1149
00:59:46,608 --> 00:59:52,400
cordyceps and lion's mane and I think

1150
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:54,349
that's a really nice balance okay I'm

1151
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:56,980
not promoting it just I'm sure that

1152
00:59:54,349 --> 01:00:00,140
there are other people offering the same

1153
00:59:56,980 --> 01:00:02,119
same type of mixes and what-have-you and

1154
01:00:00,139 --> 01:00:05,179
if I get those mushrooms or when I do

1155
01:00:02,119 --> 01:00:06,800
get those mushrooms from China I'll be

1156
01:00:05,179 --> 01:00:08,779
more than happy to share those spores

1157
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:11,510
with you I even have an electric stir

1158
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:13,550
plate you know for mixing the spores

1159
01:00:11,510 --> 01:00:18,859
with the honey water and all that stuff

1160
01:00:13,550 --> 01:00:21,140
for inoculation and oh cool so we we we

1161
01:00:18,858 --> 01:00:25,489
emptied our house out have you seen that

1162
01:00:21,139 --> 01:00:28,848
book about how to the Maria Connery

1163
01:00:25,489 --> 01:00:31,879
condo book yeah well basically we

1164
01:00:28,849 --> 01:00:35,050
stripped this house clean furniture

1165
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:39,890
everything gone Wow

1166
01:00:35,050 --> 01:00:43,640
one was I wanted to do the floors right

1167
01:00:39,889 --> 01:00:47,629
and it's a lot less money if they're not

1168
01:00:43,639 --> 01:00:49,279
having to move furniture around yeah so

1169
01:00:47,630 --> 01:00:51,940
part of it was so part of it was an

1170
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:55,540
economic consideration but you know

1171
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:57,559
since we've done that I haven't bothered

1172
01:00:55,539 --> 01:01:00,980
you'll get a lot of furniture I got a

1173
01:00:57,559 --> 01:01:03,289
couple Nordic recliners that was pretty

1174
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:04,240
cool so I'm not a minimalist you know

1175
01:01:03,289 --> 01:01:07,779
I'm not going to sit in here

1176
01:01:04,239 --> 01:01:11,759
the Adirondack chairs from Walmart or

1177
01:01:07,780 --> 01:01:14,080
something but uh I just thought you know

1178
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:19,470
owning a bunch of stuff is really a

1179
01:01:14,079 --> 01:01:22,960
downer I don't know is then you gotta be

1180
01:01:19,469 --> 01:01:28,569
responsible for you know yeah and you

1181
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:30,130
have to maintain edit yeah tell somebody

1182
01:01:28,570 --> 01:01:34,150
about it oh that's really cool you know

1183
01:01:30,130 --> 01:01:36,700
it's like I had a friend of mine he was

1184
01:01:34,150 --> 01:01:40,619
really brilliant in high school and he

1185
01:01:36,699 --> 01:01:46,689
got a scholarship and went to Harvard

1186
01:01:40,619 --> 01:01:52,559
and then about a year after he graduated

1187
01:01:46,690 --> 01:01:55,720
Harvard he began a downward trajectory

1188
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:59,079
alcohol and you know whatever other

1189
01:01:55,719 --> 01:02:01,689
drugs I remember one time he said if he

1190
01:01:59,079 --> 01:02:03,309
goes you know the people are still

1191
01:02:01,690 --> 01:02:09,670
really impressed that I went to Harvard

1192
01:02:03,309 --> 01:02:11,139
I said yeah but I don't know so what you

1193
01:02:09,670 --> 01:02:17,230
know write a book or something I guess

1194
01:02:11,139 --> 01:02:17,739
you know my years at Harvard I I don't

1195
01:02:17,230 --> 01:02:23,980
know

1196
01:02:17,739 --> 01:02:27,759
this last year getting ready to fully

1197
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:30,610
retire and you know unloading the house

1198
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:33,100
payment that was really liberating it's

1199
01:02:30,610 --> 01:02:39,519
like all I got to do is come over $300 a

1200
01:02:33,099 --> 01:02:40,029
month for property taxes here that's

1201
01:02:39,519 --> 01:02:44,170
great

1202
01:02:40,030 --> 01:02:46,630
that's like I paid more than that when I

1203
01:02:44,170 --> 01:02:50,500
got a high school you know rent having

1204
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:54,130
300 a month so yeah it's pretty cool I

1205
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:56,230
mean I don't know I just I don't feel I

1206
01:02:54,130 --> 01:03:01,800
need the other than toys you know I mean

1207
01:02:56,230 --> 01:03:01,800
some is another camera I want to get

1208
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:04,930
because I know right well I really want

1209
01:03:04,300 --> 01:03:08,680
to learn

1210
01:03:04,929 --> 01:03:13,169
just for my own pleasure I guess is how

1211
01:03:08,679 --> 01:03:15,879
to do video editing on the iPad yeah and

1212
01:03:13,170 --> 01:03:17,789
there's and there's a really

1213
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:20,730
professional work being done

1214
01:03:17,789 --> 01:03:24,239
I compete with that but just to see the

1215
01:03:20,730 --> 01:03:30,000
challenge there of mixing audio tracks

1216
01:03:24,239 --> 01:03:31,949
and with the video that I shoot and yeah

1217
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:34,860
it's you know it's fun it's a lot better

1218
01:03:31,949 --> 01:03:38,039
than I got powdery mildew what should I

1219
01:03:34,860 --> 01:03:40,500
do in your case I'd take a machete and

1220
01:03:38,039 --> 01:03:41,690
take it down and hope you know for

1221
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:45,329
better luck next year

1222
01:03:41,690 --> 01:03:47,670
yeah okay I mean I'm glad I'm glad

1223
01:03:45,329 --> 01:03:50,730
you're doing well and I'm glad we got to

1224
01:03:47,670 --> 01:03:53,280
talk about mushrooms and minimalism and

1225
01:03:50,730 --> 01:03:54,809
cannabis a little bit and I think it

1226
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:55,940
would be really cool as we were doing

1227
01:03:54,809 --> 01:03:58,049
this I was just thinking in my head

1228
01:03:55,940 --> 01:04:00,570
it'll be cool to come back on and not

1229
01:03:58,050 --> 01:04:03,420
talk about how to grow psilocybin

1230
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:08,300
mushrooms necessarily but to just talk

1231
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:10,680
about some of the effects and usage and

1232
01:04:08,300 --> 01:04:12,390
some of your experiences I think would

1233
01:04:10,679 --> 01:04:15,779
be cool to share in a separate interview

1234
01:04:12,389 --> 01:04:19,049
if you're open to it yeah I am the only

1235
01:04:15,780 --> 01:04:24,710
thing making really I mean you know my

1236
01:04:19,050 --> 01:04:28,920
first experience with psilocybin was C

1237
01:04:24,710 --> 01:04:33,869
1968 so that's 51 years ago I want to

1238
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:39,930
give it all away but I just want to say

1239
01:04:33,869 --> 01:04:45,869
that the micro dosing became a really

1240
01:04:39,929 --> 01:04:47,609
big part of this transition and what I

1241
01:04:45,869 --> 01:04:50,069
would use in your life huh

1242
01:04:47,610 --> 01:04:53,340
recently in your life yeah I start I

1243
01:04:50,070 --> 01:04:56,760
went to see Paul Stamets give us talk in

1244
01:04:53,340 --> 01:04:58,590
September about what nine months ago in

1245
01:04:56,760 --> 01:05:01,770
fact that was when I sent you that was

1246
01:04:58,590 --> 01:05:04,829
from that presentation and so I thought

1247
01:05:01,769 --> 01:05:10,050
hmmm I want to give this a shot so I did

1248
01:05:04,829 --> 01:05:11,519
and so I started October 1st and so

1249
01:05:10,050 --> 01:05:17,600
that's what eight and a half months now

1250
01:05:11,519 --> 01:05:17,599
and the one thing that I can say is that

1251
01:05:18,019 --> 01:05:26,909
when somebody asked me well what did it

1252
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:28,800
do for instant clarity and that to me

1253
01:05:26,909 --> 01:05:31,710
was the biggest gift I could have ever

1254
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:37,349
been given at this stage of my life

1255
01:05:31,710 --> 01:05:39,630
and had such knowledge been out there 10

1256
01:05:37,349 --> 01:05:45,000
20 years ago I would have anyway I'm not

1257
01:05:39,630 --> 01:05:47,099
I don't sell things and so it matters

1258
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:50,449
not to me but I just know that people

1259
01:05:47,099 --> 01:05:56,670
who are suffering from depression

1260
01:05:50,449 --> 01:06:01,318
long-term hardcore depression that well

1261
01:05:56,670 --> 01:06:05,280
my daughter for example she died after

1262
01:06:01,318 --> 01:06:17,039
struggling for 12 years with she was

1263
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:20,040
finally diagnosed as schizophrenic 12

1264
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:25,279
years you know it was a real tragedy and

1265
01:06:20,039 --> 01:06:25,279
I just wonder if that could have been

1266
01:06:27,949 --> 01:06:41,269
helpful yeah and if we just get rid of

1267
01:06:35,969 --> 01:06:46,068
this silly social and political crap

1268
01:06:41,269 --> 01:06:49,068
about how we treat different situations

1269
01:06:46,068 --> 01:06:52,048
one is that for example end-of-life

1270
01:06:49,068 --> 01:06:54,539
that's a hard thing for anybody to deal

1271
01:06:52,048 --> 01:06:57,420
with you know you're given a diagnosis

1272
01:06:54,539 --> 01:07:01,289
you know you're gonna be you know tidy

1273
01:06:57,420 --> 01:07:06,240
up your affairs and so research at John

1274
01:07:01,289 --> 01:07:10,739
Hopkins and other major research have

1275
01:07:06,239 --> 01:07:15,989
found that administering these

1276
01:07:10,739 --> 01:07:19,289
psychotropic mushrooms help people make

1277
01:07:15,989 --> 01:07:22,318
that bridge psychologically so that it

1278
01:07:19,289 --> 01:07:24,929
isn't just doom they can put things in

1279
01:07:22,318 --> 01:07:30,269
perspective and why wouldn't we want to

1280
01:07:24,929 --> 01:07:33,629
do that for our friends our parents or

1281
01:07:30,269 --> 01:07:35,329
anybody I mean why wouldn't we want that

1282
01:07:33,630 --> 01:07:39,180
available or at least research it

1283
01:07:35,329 --> 01:07:41,039
correctly research not I don't know you

1284
01:07:39,179 --> 01:07:44,639
I listen to dead or Jimi Hendrix you

1285
01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:45,599
know kind of thing so uh yeah I guess

1286
01:07:44,639 --> 01:07:47,670
that if I had

1287
01:07:45,599 --> 01:07:50,130
soapbox that would be it that we need to

1288
01:07:47,670 --> 01:07:51,389
change and I'm involved with the group

1289
01:07:50,130 --> 01:07:55,640
here in Oregon trying to get it on the

1290
01:07:51,389 --> 01:07:58,489
ballot next year not to legalize not to

1291
01:07:55,639 --> 01:08:01,289
even decriminalize just to allow

1292
01:07:58,489 --> 01:08:03,919
legitimate research that has been done

1293
01:08:01,289 --> 01:08:08,159
at Harvard and John Hopkins and

1294
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:13,050
universities in Asia and Europe and what

1295
01:08:08,159 --> 01:08:14,879
have you and so if we can bring the

1296
01:08:13,050 --> 01:08:18,180
freeze I like you know put some adults

1297
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:22,409
in charge okay they don't have an agenda

1298
01:08:18,180 --> 01:08:26,039
trying to promote you know ABC mental

1299
01:08:22,409 --> 01:08:30,529
health services or something yep yeah

1300
01:08:26,039 --> 01:08:30,529
pharmaceuticals what I used to call it a

1301
01:08:31,250 --> 01:08:37,020
state bombed pharmaceuticals I always

1302
01:08:34,739 --> 01:08:41,608
thought would be a really good name for

1303
01:08:37,020 --> 01:08:44,550
a cannabis company so but in a serious

1304
01:08:41,609 --> 01:08:51,090
sense I mean the way that we're treating

1305
01:08:44,550 --> 01:08:56,039
our our citizens and our friends and our

1306
01:08:51,090 --> 01:09:01,670
family is it's really horrible

1307
01:08:56,039 --> 01:09:04,289
I watched my daughter go through every

1308
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:06,810
prozac and I mean I can't even name them

1309
01:09:04,289 --> 01:09:09,449
all sure yeah and I just saw this

1310
01:09:06,810 --> 01:09:15,780
downward you know watching your child

1311
01:09:09,449 --> 01:09:17,550
die over 12 years was well it's not

1312
01:09:15,779 --> 01:09:19,259
something that I would want I would wish

1313
01:09:17,550 --> 01:09:23,159
I'm like I don't have enemies but I

1314
01:09:19,260 --> 01:09:24,810
would wish on nobody you know we have to

1315
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:26,340
do something better I don't know that I

1316
01:09:24,810 --> 01:09:28,350
don't know I don't have the answers I'm

1317
01:09:26,340 --> 01:09:30,779
not a medical doctor don't pretend to be

1318
01:09:28,350 --> 01:09:35,160
but what I do know is that what we're

1319
01:09:30,779 --> 01:09:40,369
doing isn't working and how is your

1320
01:09:35,159 --> 01:09:42,899
father he's good he's uh he's

1321
01:09:40,369 --> 01:09:45,630
semi-retired now I mean he's got a whole

1322
01:09:42,899 --> 01:09:47,819
bunch of projects going on around in

1323
01:09:45,630 --> 01:09:49,560
there out on the Olympic Peninsula now

1324
01:09:47,819 --> 01:09:52,108
they actually had a whale wash up on

1325
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:53,480
their Beach a grey whale this last my

1326
01:09:52,109 --> 01:09:56,410
goodness well

1327
01:09:53,479 --> 01:09:59,299
seeing one of those in person was crazy

1328
01:09:56,409 --> 01:10:00,920
so we went out there for that they got

1329
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:03,470
to they were able to move it fortunately

1330
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:07,010
because the thing stunk like you would

1331
01:10:03,470 --> 01:10:09,440
not believe as it's not proposing or the

1332
01:10:07,010 --> 01:10:12,079
famous video from the 60s when they blew

1333
01:10:09,439 --> 01:10:16,659
one up on the organ beach oh I heard

1334
01:10:12,079 --> 01:10:20,659
about that oh my god yeah I don't know

1335
01:10:16,659 --> 01:10:26,119
this is gonna slow news day but yeah the

1336
01:10:20,659 --> 01:10:30,079
we we go to Kate Mears for well watching

1337
01:10:26,119 --> 01:10:31,880
here in Oregon and to see them moving

1338
01:10:30,079 --> 01:10:35,269
north or south even at time of year

1339
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:36,890
whatever yeah it's pretty uh they're

1340
01:10:35,270 --> 01:10:39,650
pretty incredible creatures I don't want

1341
01:10:36,890 --> 01:10:40,700
to take away from that I mean I ideally

1342
01:10:39,649 --> 01:10:42,259
it never would have washed up on the

1343
01:10:40,699 --> 01:10:43,880
beach but since it did we took the

1344
01:10:42,260 --> 01:10:50,480
opportunity to actually get to see it up

1345
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:56,750
close absolutely uh yeah yeah I was

1346
01:10:50,479 --> 01:10:59,709
wondering this one one final thought you

1347
01:10:56,750 --> 01:11:02,390
know the life I'm not trying to get into

1348
01:10:59,710 --> 01:11:05,090
anybody's religious beliefs whatever

1349
01:11:02,390 --> 01:11:09,920
certainly not that but if we could agree

1350
01:11:05,090 --> 01:11:12,020
that life came from the ocean and the

1351
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:15,619
former plants I think that's what it's

1352
01:11:12,020 --> 01:11:17,740
so remarkable about kelp kelp meal in

1353
01:11:15,619 --> 01:11:21,289
its purest form like the form that you

1354
01:11:17,739 --> 01:11:23,739
use and I used to pull it out of the

1355
01:11:21,289 --> 01:11:28,069
ocean dry it in the Sun and chop it up

1356
01:11:23,739 --> 01:11:29,449
yeah there's so much benefit there not

1357
01:11:28,069 --> 01:11:33,259
just the plants yeah I mean that's a

1358
01:11:29,449 --> 01:11:40,090
given you know for uh agriculture and

1359
01:11:33,260 --> 01:11:49,909
horticulture but taking a capsule a day

1360
01:11:40,090 --> 01:11:55,159
is remarkable of beneficial and it's

1361
01:11:49,909 --> 01:11:59,329
better quality that we get Acadian see

1362
01:11:55,159 --> 01:12:02,449
plants material yeah it's coming out of

1363
01:11:59,329 --> 01:12:04,039
clean water cleaner water than I would

1364
01:12:02,449 --> 01:12:07,260
want to necessarily do the Pacific with

1365
01:12:04,039 --> 01:12:11,220
all the tankers and what-have-you moving

1366
01:12:07,260 --> 01:12:15,510
cross it but uh yeah I started taking

1367
01:12:11,220 --> 01:12:17,369
kelp caps just uh I'd have to re weigh

1368
01:12:15,510 --> 01:12:19,140
it but it's probably a little bit more

1369
01:12:17,369 --> 01:12:23,279
than maybe a little bit more than a gram

1370
01:12:19,140 --> 01:12:26,670
a day and I saw because I when I got

1371
01:12:23,279 --> 01:12:28,439
this puppy from my good friend said it

1372
01:12:26,670 --> 01:12:36,600
forget it organics he gave me this

1373
01:12:28,439 --> 01:12:37,409
bulldog puppy and so I went to this we'd

1374
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:40,020
be cool

1375
01:12:37,409 --> 01:12:43,829
holistic I love that term holistic pet

1376
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:46,260
center and they had kelp meal yes I'm

1377
01:12:43,829 --> 01:12:50,579
reading the label it's the same variety

1378
01:12:46,260 --> 01:12:55,110
that we use in our soil mixes and look

1379
01:12:50,579 --> 01:12:58,229
the price was $18 a pound well because

1380
01:12:55,109 --> 01:13:01,769
they big rounded finer I mean I can live

1381
01:12:58,229 --> 01:13:03,989
with it you know so I started giving her

1382
01:13:01,770 --> 01:13:06,690
a teaspoon in the morning with her meals

1383
01:13:03,989 --> 01:13:11,219
and then teaspoon at night with her meal

1384
01:13:06,689 --> 01:13:19,559
and all the puppies that came out of

1385
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:24,360
that same litter most of the puppies the

1386
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:26,280
gift-giver test sees those puppies and

1387
01:13:24,359 --> 01:13:30,679
you say man without a doubt your dog is

1388
01:13:26,279 --> 01:13:35,279
the biggest the strongest healthiest and

1389
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:38,670
so talking with a rep from ASL to trade

1390
01:13:35,279 --> 01:13:41,550
show one time he said look Jim he says

1391
01:13:38,670 --> 01:13:43,560
you know we love you guys but if people

1392
01:13:41,550 --> 01:13:47,100
quit using it near so we wouldn't even

1393
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:50,160
mention it at a stockholders meeting you

1394
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:51,380
know you guys are nothing which is you

1395
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:54,210
know truth

1396
01:13:51,380 --> 01:13:55,760
the majority of kelp is used in

1397
01:13:54,210 --> 01:14:00,810
biomedicine

1398
01:13:55,760 --> 01:14:02,930
for human and animals but you want

1399
01:14:00,810 --> 01:14:06,510
stronger

1400
01:14:02,930 --> 01:14:09,960
whatever it is horses dogs livestock

1401
01:14:06,510 --> 01:14:12,869
kelp meal my chiropractor has draft

1402
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:14,670
horse he's got like 20 of them talk

1403
01:14:12,869 --> 01:14:17,220
about a weird hobby I go do you write

1404
01:14:14,670 --> 01:14:19,260
them you can't write crap horses so what

1405
01:14:17,220 --> 01:14:21,270
do you doing them because he's just

1406
01:14:19,260 --> 01:14:23,340
beautiful to look at

1407
01:14:21,270 --> 01:14:25,650
anyway we were talking to in yeah and

1408
01:14:23,340 --> 01:14:30,510
guess what it's part of their diet

1409
01:14:25,649 --> 01:14:33,319
includes rock desk and kelp meal huh I

1410
01:14:30,510 --> 01:14:36,030
just found that really fascinating so I

1411
01:14:33,319 --> 01:14:38,849
turned him on to using concentrates

1412
01:14:36,029 --> 01:14:43,109
because the selection and quality price

1413
01:14:38,850 --> 01:14:47,340
and then I got him off of glacial rock

1414
01:14:43,109 --> 01:14:49,469
dust and over to basalt and you know he

1415
01:14:47,340 --> 01:14:52,110
he was really impressed with the changes

1416
01:14:49,470 --> 01:14:54,060
that he saw in his but anyway so there's

1417
01:14:52,109 --> 01:14:57,929
more in commonality with plants and

1418
01:14:54,060 --> 01:15:01,860
animals than we probably want to address

1419
01:14:57,930 --> 01:15:03,750
or can't address yeah you know I think I

1420
01:15:01,859 --> 01:15:05,639
just trying to interesting when I

1421
01:15:03,750 --> 01:15:08,909
started adding it to my mushroom

1422
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:11,670
substrate hello wow this is really cool

1423
01:15:08,909 --> 01:15:13,949
I mean this is like and I want to get

1424
01:15:11,670 --> 01:15:16,409
back to you on that question because you

1425
01:15:13,949 --> 01:15:20,639
asked a really legitimate question that

1426
01:15:16,409 --> 01:15:24,210
I cannot find a definitive answer can we

1427
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:26,160
tweak the substrate and increase

1428
01:15:24,210 --> 01:15:28,649
whatever properties is we're looking for

1429
01:15:26,159 --> 01:15:31,470
we want to a more meat like flavor will

1430
01:15:28,649 --> 01:15:34,469
say in a oyster mushroom can we

1431
01:15:31,470 --> 01:15:37,409
manipulate that with the sub just

1432
01:15:34,470 --> 01:15:39,180
because you can draw it on newsprint I'm

1433
01:15:37,409 --> 01:15:41,489
sure we can and we just don't have the

1434
01:15:39,180 --> 01:15:42,930
research on it yet no we don't I'm

1435
01:15:41,489 --> 01:15:45,389
positive that it would change the

1436
01:15:42,930 --> 01:15:47,280
flavors and I mean that's that's what

1437
01:15:45,390 --> 01:15:50,039
happens with all vegetables I don't see

1438
01:15:47,279 --> 01:15:55,380
why the pathways good fungus like yeah

1439
01:15:50,039 --> 01:15:57,560
and so that's something that my friend

1440
01:15:55,380 --> 01:16:04,369
and I have really been focused on is

1441
01:15:57,560 --> 01:16:07,110
trying to bring some of the practices

1442
01:16:04,369 --> 01:16:11,460
that we've been doing for several years

1443
01:16:07,109 --> 01:16:15,299
in the area of soil mixes which one of

1444
01:16:11,460 --> 01:16:20,789
those can we bring over here to this and

1445
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:28,199
make see a benefit a viable benefit yeah

1446
01:16:20,789 --> 01:16:29,340
and I and I think that we we are but you

1447
01:16:28,199 --> 01:16:31,699
know it's kind of like you already know

1448
01:16:29,340 --> 01:16:35,310
I don't want to sell substrate I mean

1449
01:16:31,699 --> 01:16:42,309
sure I don't want to listen to

1450
01:16:35,310 --> 01:16:44,980
you know well I got a run for today

1451
01:16:42,310 --> 01:16:46,930
alright man you so much we'll have to

1452
01:16:44,979 --> 01:16:48,219
