1
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:10,240
so it's Adam Arnold Collective elevation

2
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:11,759
um we're in Boseman Montana is where

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,879
we're based out of our dispensaries are

4
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,679
in uh but Billings Missoula and Boseman

5
00:00:14,878 --> 00:00:19,399
as well tell me about Collective

6
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:23,079
elevations since this is you know your

7
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:24,439
your company yeah well uh this was all

8
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:26,518
founded

9
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:27,879
from being passionate about growing

10
00:00:26,518 --> 00:00:31,000
cannabis since essentially I was a

11
00:00:27,879 --> 00:00:33,399
little kid and so

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,238
initially what happened when Montana

13
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:38,840
started allowing legal medical marijuana

14
00:00:37,238 --> 00:00:40,359
uh I purchased a farm that was

15
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:44,320
completely off grid out in the middle of

16
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:46,280
nowhere and went with hybrid just just

17
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,119
basically hoop house facilities you're

18
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:51,640
just running one or or pulling tarp

19
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:53,280
light dep and I learned a lot uh my

20
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:56,239
business partner Carl at the same time

21
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,920
was an indoor fully Hydro salt-based guy

22
00:00:56,238 --> 00:01:00,358
and at the end of a couple of years we

23
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,198
were just friends at that point a couple

24
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:05,478
of years we saw that one of us was doing

25
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:07,920
significantly better on our yields and

26
00:01:05,478 --> 00:01:09,599
overall just profitability and the other

27
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,200
one was and then still getting winners

28
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:13,919
off and so we saw the potential of

29
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,680
living soil and and what it does for

30
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,040
plant Health uh the problem with the

31
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,640
offgrid facility even though it was

32
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,200
extremely sustainable was you had to

33
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,759
make up for that with a ton of work

34
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:27,240
stoking wood stoves carrying water just

35
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:29,000
a a lot of the tea tanks were trash cans

36
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:30,719
and carrying five gallon buckets 100

37
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,680
yards so there was so many

38
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:35,840
inefficiencies in that off-- grid style

39
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,280
and waking up at 3:00 a.m. stoking these

40
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,680
wood stoves I was always dreaming of man

41
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,799
what if I could see this on my phone

42
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,079
what if I had a greenhouse that could

43
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,479
run all winter and you didn't have to

44
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:46,199
worry about it and so that sparked what

45
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:51,438
is the modern iteration of our our

46
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:53,759
current Farm um as soon as 2017 legisl

47
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:55,478
legislation pretty much cemented the

48
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,280
Cannabis industry in Montana as being

49
00:01:55,478 --> 00:01:59,438
around a stay and not subject to

50
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,039
shutdown and lawsuits that was the first

51
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:03,519
time we could really invest um in

52
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:06,039
anything more than a rental because we

53
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:08,878
didn't know that if it wouldn't get shut

54
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:11,479
down entirely so at starting in

55
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:13,959
2017 we started building this out and we

56
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:17,639
built it out in about four different

57
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:20,640
phases um learning as we went and just

58
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:23,318
always trying to troubleshoot and evolve

59
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:25,399
to have the best most efficient system

60
00:02:23,318 --> 00:02:26,878
we possibly can so this is the biggest

61
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,920
as far as I know growth facility in

62
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:32,639
Montana let alone living soil um and

63
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:34,719
that all evolved from both seeing the

64
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:36,359
potential of plant Health uh the quality

65
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:38,959
we started winning cannabis cups in

66
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,800
Montana really early and we saw that

67
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,439
living soil was outpacing our Hydro at

68
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,680
the time

69
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:47,639
and then of course you take into account

70
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,879
cost Effectiveness and once the labor

71
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:52,919
the initial soils in the the labor

72
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:54,318
savings Alone um all the dots were

73
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:57,359
finally just pretty connected it was

74
00:02:54,318 --> 00:03:00,399
apparent over a series of years that

75
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,200
this style has chops um for both quality

76
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,879
is so rare in life that you get a win

77
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:05,878
win win that's better for the people

78
00:03:03,878 --> 00:03:07,598
better for the planet cheaper to produce

79
00:03:05,878 --> 00:03:09,120
and that's not really a thing that

80
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:10,639
happens in business very often usually

81
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,400
one of those things has to be sacrificed

82
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:14,199
and we stumbled upon something and we've

83
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,319
just kind of been running with it ever

84
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:20,639
since so even

85
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:22,039
though um you're organic that's that's

86
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:23,518
almost just a perk on the commercial

87
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:27,560
scale because of the you're you're

88
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:29,879
finding it's actually cheaper less labor

89
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,199
um and has all these other commercial

90
00:03:29,878 --> 00:03:33,919
benefits on scale that make it

91
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:35,560
worthwhile and Organics is well that may

92
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:37,318
be something you're passionate about

93
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,360
it's uh it's sort of like an added bonus

94
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:41,958
on top of all the other absolutely I

95
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,720
mean if we can if we can be more

96
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:45,239
sustainable than everyone else then and

97
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:48,359
that is a core premise of our our

98
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:51,039
mission statement as a company um that

99
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:53,000
being said it so that was actually why

100
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:54,560
we started down this path we just

101
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
realized that there was these secondary

102
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,759
benefits of of also a better product

103
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,840
that turned out to be cheaper and and

104
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:04,000
then a few other things that happened to

105
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:07,719
us like our local grow store shutting

106
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,079
down a few years ago now since we've had

107
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:11,719
sparked us to getting Trailer Load you

108
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:13,840
know filling up semi- trucks worth of

109
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:16,079
amendments and doing it once a year and

110
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,439
planning ahead and just trying to scale

111
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:21,639
in every way that we possibly could

112
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:24,639
before the rest of the industry uh gets

113
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:27,319
to that level beating them to

114
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,519
Market so uh tell me tell me your name

115

um I am the facility manager SL

118
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:42,560
cultivation director sometimes um you

119
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:48,160
know I do most of facility maintenance

120

uh design um you know uh do a lot of the

121
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:54,039
construction and you know figuring out

122
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:56,360
how new systems can be implemented or to

123
00:04:54,038 --> 00:04:59,680
make things more efficient and um better

124
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:01,639
for the company as as a whole ni see you

125
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:05,879
wear a ton of hats and kind of solve so

126
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:08,519
many hats yep I uh I dabble in you know

127
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:12,319
minor electrical I do all the plumbing

128
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:16,439
for irrigation systems tank setups uh pH

129
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:19,599
injection systems um yeah I do

130
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:22,079
fabricating I do yeah I do jack of all

131
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:25,720
trades really now were you a grower

132
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:28,478
before you uh yes yeah so I have been

133
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:30,039
cultivating cannabis for about uh eight

134
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:33,399
nine years now

135
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:38,279
um started off growing in a fourcc car

136
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:41,879
garage for a local dispensary um and um

137
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:46,038
that plants were on cinder blocks and uh

138
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:50,038
plastic trays and since after that uh I

139
00:05:46,038 --> 00:05:53,240
went to a Coco Hydro setup um with a

140
00:05:50,038 --> 00:05:55,478
dispensary here in town uh spark one and

141
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:58,639
I was there I would say I learned a

142
00:05:55,478 --> 00:06:02,279
majority of my you know cultivation

143
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:04,600
practices and whatnot um through them

144
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:09,159
and then uh so it was a very different

145
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:11,879
transition coming from a super sterile

146
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:15,120
you know plant environment using cocoa

147
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:18,120
substrate Hydroponics salts you know

148
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,840
mixing up batch tanks and then coming to

149
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:24,038
like the whole living soil you know kind

150
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:26,560
of organic you know way of things so it

151
00:06:24,038 --> 00:06:28,519
was a fun transition and I don't think I

152
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,360
could ever go back to growing in

153
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:34,680
Hydroponics

154
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:37,800
yeah yeah so last question I'm I'm super

155
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:40,560
interested in the Unistrut tray

156
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:43,079
TBL cuz I need that at my house yeah I

157
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,959
will have to draw you up some plans are

158
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:48,120
you welding the unistruts um so the

159
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:50,478
trays that you were interested in uh for

160
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:53,199
our mother room uh that all of our two

161
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:57,199
4x4 beds are on those were not welded

162
00:06:53,199 --> 00:07:00,038
together um they make Universal kind of

163
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:02,280
brackets that you can Bolt together all

164
00:07:00,038 --> 00:07:04,639
of the Unistrut and kind of make you

165
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:07,399
know whatever shape and length and width

166
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:10,400
you would want nice okay and then you

167
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:13,399
know just using the casters you know if

168
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:14,758
you get a the right size Caster that is

169
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:17,359
you know can

170
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:22,960
withstand I think the casters on those

171
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:27,199
trays were about 350 450 lbs per per

172
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:28,959
wheel um and we do you know uh a wheel

173
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:33,000
on each corner and then two in the

174
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:35,799
center of a 4 by 4 by8 tray okay so it

175
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
can support a lot of that Center weight

176
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,840
yeah I love that there's a lot of really

177
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,439
cool Innovation that I see just little a

178
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:44,679
huge difference yeah yeah and that's

179
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:47,560
kind of my uh that's my my forte is I

180
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:49,478
love yeah both my parents are Engineers

181
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,360
um so I kind of and I I didn't

182
00:07:49,478 --> 00:07:53,639
necessarily go to school for engineering

183
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,400
but I have that mindset of like looking

184
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:57,519
at things in a different way and seeing

185
00:07:55,399 --> 00:08:00,198
how I can kind of accomplish certain

186
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:02,198
things on my own very cool yeah all

187
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:03,759
right well thank you yeah thank you uh

188
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:05,879
can you tell me a little bit about about

189
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:08,639
yourself and what your role is here yeah

190
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:10,439
um I'm Jared um I'm our one of our

191
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,280
cultivation guys I'm doing most of our

192
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:14,918
uh fertilizer management nutrient

193
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:17,399
management um a lot of our irrigation

194
00:08:14,918 --> 00:08:18,799
stuff so just kind of monitoring all our

195
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:20,478
green houses like throughout a daily

196
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,639
basis and stuff and just working amongst

197
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:24,719
the other Crews and everything kind of

198
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:27,280
get everything done um yeah so we just

199
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,720
toured the facility um so I I'll share

200
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:30,318
some video of that and we can look at

201
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,839
the irrigation and things but tell me a

202
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:35,800
little bit about your your process for

203
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:38,440
maintaining the soil um a lot of testing

204
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:39,799
so we're every run we're testing a

205
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:42,680
little bit before Harvest kind of making

206
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:43,879
our amendments based off of that um

207
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:47,120
looking kind of trying to see what we're

208
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:49,639
deficient in um putting together a good

209
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,120
like fertilizer plan that's going to

210
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:53,240
meet our needs while not giving us too

211
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,759
much Surplus we don't want to be

212
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,240
wasteful so kind of meeting our needs

213
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:58,799
without getting into too much Surplus

214
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,759
within our soil um a lot of monitoring

215
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:03,039
post of our post our first amendment um

216
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:04,360
especially throughout kind of our veg

217
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:06,719
time just monitoring our plants for like

218
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:08,680
their nitrogen needs and everything um

219
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,959
we'll do some foler testing if we feel

220
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:11,879
like we got something going on for the

221
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:14,518
most part our soil testing is kind of

222
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:15,679
our good uh standard go-to to kind of

223
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:17,120
check out what we got going on in the

224
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:20,719
soil

225
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,720
um for the most part we're using dry

226
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,800
amendments um we try to use those over

227
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,879
like kind of liquid feeding at all um

228
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:28,078
and we don't really have any liquid

229
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:30,000
feeds but for the most part dry

230
00:09:28,078 --> 00:09:33,000
amendments usually kind of mixed in the

231
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,078
first like 6 in or so of our soil um

232
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,039
okay so a lot of the standard kind of

233
00:09:35,078 --> 00:09:38,319
organic uh products we're trying to use

234
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:40,719
a lot of

235
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,680
um we're a lot of like fish meal some

236
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,240
fishbone meal we use like gypsum sulfate

237
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:47,799
of pot as kind of all the and then

238
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:51,320
you're uh addressing any fertility

239
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:53,439
things that come up with keas or liquid

240
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,839
yes so if we do have any like kind of

241
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,000
for the most part we've been lucky

242
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:58,160
lately to where we've been getting into

243
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,759
a Groove where we haven't necessarily

244
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:03,159
seen as many like kind of later growth

245
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:04,360
deficiencies um been doing a good job of

246
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:05,639
kind of getting to our nitrogen needs

247
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:08,278
early and everything and same with our

248
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:09,879
other uh nutrient needs but if we do run

249
00:10:08,278 --> 00:10:11,799
into those issues we're doing some top

250
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:13,399
dressing or some like liquid feeding

251
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:14,799
through like our micro tees where we'll

252
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:16,039
put if we're looking like we're nitrogen

253
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:18,439
deficient we'll use like some fish

254
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:19,958
hydraulic within those uh those teas or

255
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,920
we can do some like nutrient soaks as

256
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:24,518
well um but yeah for the most part we're

257
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:26,240
trying to kind of cover our bases

258
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:28,759
earlier pre-planting so that way we're

259
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,200
not running into those issues where by

260
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:31,639
the time you're seeing it into the plant

261
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,959
it's been a few weeks or it's been a

262
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:34,799
week or so already that the plant's

263
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:36,439
deficient so kind of trying to

264
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:38,759
preemptively take care of those issues

265
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:42,240
rather than uh Wai and seeing them and

266
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:45,360
then responding but yeah very cool yep

267
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,360
sweet thank all right

268
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,440
thanks
