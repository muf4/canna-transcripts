00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:44,159
integrative plant science at cornell

43
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:45,840
university where i teach courses and

44
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,840
mentor students

45
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:52,880
in our hemp science mps program and

46
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,799
collaborate with my colleagues in

47
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:57,839
various different departments and our

48
00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:00,560
industry partners to learn more about

49
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,560
the cultivation and processing of hemp

50
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,040
and cannabis

51
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,359
yeah i was so excited when we connected

52
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,118
because

53
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:11,680
one it's great to see more and more

54
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:13,360
universities coming online and see

55
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,159
uh programs like this that we're gonna

56
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:19,520
talk about but also just cornell itself

57
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:21,199
has such a rich agricultural history um

58
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,520
it's such a prestigious school that it's

59
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:24,639
it's just very exciting for me so thank

60
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,400
you

61
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:29,439
it's exciting for me as well we're

62
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,319
definitely seeing a whole new ecosystem

63
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:34,159
of

64
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:37,039
education options pop up both informal

65
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:40,318
education like your podcast

66
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:42,639
but also certification programs

67
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:46,000
associates degree programs at community

68
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:49,839
colleges bachelor's degree

69
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:53,680
majors and minors in cannabis as well as

70
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:55,680
now some graduate level courses

71
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,879
well let's talk a little bit about the

72
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,800
hemp science program at cornell can you

73
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:03,199
can you give a little background into

74
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,760
what it entails

75
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:07,679
yeah i can definitely do that so

76
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:09,759
um i think you're exactly right about

77
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,360
cornell being very well positioned

78
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:14,959
because of our land grant mission which

79
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,599
means that

80
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:20,560
we serve the need of a diverse community

81
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:22,479
of stakeholders in terms of translating

82
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,360
the latest knowledge that's out there

83
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:26,798
and generating new knowledge in areas

84
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,480
that are needed like

85
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:33,439
cannabis and hemp science so our mts

86
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:36,318
program was developed to meet the needs

87
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:39,199
of this growing industry within new york

88
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:41,839
state and beyond

89
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:44,959
it is a one year

90
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,400
course intensive although very much

91
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:50,080
hands-on

92
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:54,158
accredited master's degree program

93
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:56,159
that covers all aspects of the hemp and

94
00:03:54,158 --> 00:04:00,000
cannabis industry so

95
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:02,798
from genetics to site selection

96
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,360
different cultivation practices

97
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:08,400
processing those raw materials that are

98
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,799
grown into high value products and

99
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,840
focusing on product development even

100
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,599
covering areas like

101
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:18,560
pharmacology and

102
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:20,639
we cover a really broad array of

103
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,680
different topics so that students have a

104
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:26,079
complete understanding of the industry

105
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,560
from start to finish and our ability to

106
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:31,519
be able to cover all those topics is

107
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:34,399
very much supported by our

108
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:37,120
team of expert faculty from many

109
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:40,560
different areas whether it's seed

110
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,399
science weed science breeding genetics

111
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,439
plant pathology

112
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:47,039
food science uh the law school the

113
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:49,279
business school

114
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,520
as well as extension professionals who

115
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:53,839
are working directly with growers that

116
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:56,560
have their you know hands in the soil

117
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:59,599
and hands on plants and industry

118
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,519
partners so all coming together that are

119
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,720
actively working to support our

120
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:07,120
curriculum in each of those areas

121
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,280
yeah and folks can go on the website

122
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,600
we'll have a link on the podcast page

123
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:13,839
but you can literally type in cornell

124
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,400
hemp science and it'll be the first hit

125
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:17,918
there on google so it's easy to find

126
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:20,399
it is a master's program like you

127
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:23,439
mentioned i'm on the website right now

128
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:26,638
i'm curious as to what

129
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:29,680
sorts of uh careers or what sorts of of

130
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,120
people are taking the program

131
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,519
and where are they ending up in the

132
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,680
industry

133
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:38,719
great question so

134
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:41,360
our students who enter the program all

135
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,400
already have a bachelor's

136
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,038
degree

137
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:46,799
they don't necessarily need to be

138
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:48,879
folks with an extensive science

139
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,879
background their degree area might not

140
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:51,680
be even in a science field as long as

141
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:53,600
they're

142
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,680
fairly comfortable

143
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,639
with the sciences and have a couple

144
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,800
science

145
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,759
based courses

146
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:05,120
on their transcripts they should do fine

147
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:08,080
in our classes and we are

148
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,399
most excited about supporting students

149
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:14,478
that want to enter careers

150
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:17,038
in industry so our hemp science mps

151
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:19,038
program is a little bit different in

152
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:22,079
terms of its structure as well as its

153
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:24,159
goals from a traditional research track

154
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:26,478
master's degree so

155
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,520
it is a master's degree program but with

156
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:32,240
a slightly different focus where a

157
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:34,719
master's that has a research focus is

158
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:38,160
usually a much longer degree with very

159
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:40,400
few courses tends to be a deep dive on a

160
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,439
much more narrow range

161
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:44,959
of topics and there's usually some

162
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:47,600
substantial

163
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:49,519
novel research production that happens

164
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,599
in that kind of a degree which is for

165
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:55,758
students that may want to go and

166
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:57,839
continue on in science careers or on the

167
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:02,400
academic track perhaps go on to get a

168
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:06,799
phd and to work within academia whereas

169
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:11,038
our mps program is again this one-year

170
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:13,360
broad introduction to all aspects of the

171
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:15,918
industry where students are still

172
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:19,439
completing some significant independent

173
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:21,038
research work but not the same

174
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:23,598
breadth of

175
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:27,038
research that a master's

176
00:07:23,598 --> 00:07:28,800
research track student would complete

177
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:31,759
that's great so you're looking for real

178
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,879
like more applicable hands-on

179
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,520
uh

180
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:38,000
education for people on a wide variety

181
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:40,000
of topics it sounds like um which i

182
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,399
think frankly is more useful for from

183
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,639
and for most cases

184
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:46,399
absolutely and you you asked about the

185
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,879
kinds of careers that students who

186
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:50,079
enroll in our program are thinking about

187
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,960
and because

188
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:56,000
hemp as an industry and cannabis is

189
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:58,318
relatively new students may not be

190
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,800
exposed already to all areas so that's

191
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,280
one reason for having a relatively

192
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,199
broad curriculum in terms of the areas

193
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:07,279
that we're covering again from

194
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,598
breeding all the way to product

195
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:11,359
development and pharmacology because

196
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:14,878
they may not have had much experience

197
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:17,199
for example in a wet lab before doing

198
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,919
microbial testing or doing some of the

199
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:22,160
analytical chemistry that is so

200
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:24,079
important to the industry so once they

201
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:27,120
get some experience with that they may

202
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:29,839
realize that that is a career path that

203
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,519
could work very well for them

204
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:33,759
many of our students so not to say that

205
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:35,598
our students don't go into research or

206
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:38,639
science careers because we do have

207
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:42,240
students that have gone on to work

208
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:44,879
in r d on the cultivation side or on the

209
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,240
processing side but many of our students

210
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:49,278
do

211
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:51,759
graduate our program and then go on to

212
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:54,879
career professional careers within the

213
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:58,319
industry and don't tend to stay on the

214
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:58,320
science or academic track

215
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:04,080
okay and uh one thing i want to mention

216
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:06,799
early on in this podcast is uh we bumped

217
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,480
this podcast up and recorded it a lot

218
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:11,278
sooner than initially intended because

219
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,920
the deadline to apply for this program

220
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:15,360
is coming up it's february 15th

221
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:17,919
which doesn't give you a lot of time if

222
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,600
you want to get in there this year

223
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:21,439
but hopefully if someone listens to this

224
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,560
and is really passionate it would give

225
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,800
them maybe enough time to get an

226
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:27,919
application into

227
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:30,159
yeah absolutely so in terms of

228
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:31,679
application requirements of course the

229
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:34,879
student will have already needed to

230
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:36,479
complete their bachelor's degree

231
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:38,159
although they don't necessarily need to

232
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,800
come right from that bachelors we have

233
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:44,000
several students who have spent time in

234
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:46,879
other career fields finance real estate

235
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,720
etc and then realized later that they

236
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:50,559
want to cultivate this passion for

237
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,600
cannabis and hemp and have come to our

238
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:55,439
program so our application process is

239
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,480
relatively streamlined you need to

240
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,480
submit

241
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,200
a resume you need to have your

242
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,759
transcripts two letters of

243
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:07,360
recommendation we don't require for

244
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:09,919
example gres like many research track

245
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,039
institutions would require

246
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:13,120
so

247
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:15,838
it is relatively streamlined and there

248
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:18,720
is a little bit of flexibility around

249
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:22,000
that application date so i certainly

250
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:24,560
encourage you to reach out to me

251
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,159
by email if you are really excited about

252
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:30,958
the program but don't know if you can

253
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:30,958
make that february 15 deadline

254
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,519
great and i'm looking at the list of

255
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,519
courses here it says hemp science

256
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,879
courses uh recommended are these the

257
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,240
courses that someone would take in the

258
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:42,320
program are these other ones that you

259
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:45,519
would recommend

260
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,600
uh in addition to the core

261
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:50,639
there is a set of courses that we

262
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,879
developed specifically to the purpose of

263
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:53,919
this degree program

264
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:55,838
um

265
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:59,278
and then there's also an opportunity to

266
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:01,920
take advantage of the broad array of

267
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:02,958
other classes that are offered at

268
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:06,319
cornell

269
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:09,199
both within the ag sciences area but

270
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,440
also you know students may want to

271
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,120
work on the entrepreneurship tracks but

272
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,000
they may take courses in our business

273
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,480
school we have a fantastic goal

274
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,240
for hospitality here at cornell with

275
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,560
courses that are available for students

276
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,200
in our program to enroll in so we do

277
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:27,599
have a set of recommended or a sample

278
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,560
curriculum that tends to be the path

279
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,560
that most students take but there is a

280
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:35,119
lot of opportunity for students to

281
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:38,159
customize the courses that they take

282
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,639
relative to their specific areas of

283
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:43,919
interest and i'm happy to walk you

284
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:46,159
through a couple of the key courses that

285
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:48,879
we develop so you can get a feel for

286
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:51,919
what our program is like from the fall

287
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:53,838
semester when students enter the program

288
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:55,599
through the spring and then during the

289
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,639
summer when they're finishing their

290
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:01,759
capstone project

291
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:04,720
yeah so i know you mentioned on here are

292
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:06,799
to me that uh

293
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,839
folks that are interested in say more of

294
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:11,120
a cultivation

295
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:12,959
uh side of things since this is a

296
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,839
cultivation podcast they could cater

297
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:16,159
their

298
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,200
education around more of the cultivation

299
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:19,759
stuff right if they were less

300
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:22,160
interesting say in um

301
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:24,559
oh i don't know some of the processing

302
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:25,679
things or the lab the lab analytical

303
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:27,278
stuff

304
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:28,879
is that is that kind of what you're

305
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:31,679
saying

306
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:34,879
absolutely so i would say one feature of

307
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:38,319
our program is that we cover

308
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:42,480
cannabis sativa as the full species so

309
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:44,959
that includes the cultivars that are

310
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,839
adapted more for grain and fiber

311
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:50,719
production as well as those that are

312
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:53,760
high cannabinoid so students can

313
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:56,480
certainly select curriculum within

314
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:58,639
that series that focuses on some areas

315
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,120
versus others

316
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:03,360
they can select courses that are more on

317
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,278
the breeding track or cultivation track

318
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,480
or processing but

319
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:11,360
for me as an advisor i really

320
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:14,560
encourage students to take courses that

321
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:17,440
span the entirety of the industry

322
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:19,759
particularly because

323
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:23,279
folks who are cultivating need to be

324
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:25,838
growing with that end product in mind so

325
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:27,600
whether that's a smokeable flower or an

326
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,440
extract or something that's going to go

327
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,120
into a food product

328
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,959
and people who are working in the

329
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,399
processing side of the industry need to

330
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:36,559
understand

331
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,480
what's happening during cultivation so

332
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:40,319
that they can make sure they're making

333
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,320
good choices about the supply chain

334
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:45,199
partners that they're working with

335
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:47,440
understand the regulations that are

336
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:50,479
required of them as well as all the

337
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,800
nuances of the testing that's really

338
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,320
important for quality control and

339
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:56,559
quality assurance

340
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,399
so i i do encourage students to take

341
00:13:56,559 --> 00:14:02,319
sort of the full span so they have this

342
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:04,958
complete foundation in the industry but

343
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,600
there is still a lot of opportunity to

344
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:09,759
load up on courses that are maybe a

345
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,199
little bit heavier on the cultivation

346
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:13,039
track so

347
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:15,278
if i had a student that came into the

348
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:17,759
program and was working with me that had

349
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:20,320
a strong interest in cultivation

350
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:22,399
i would certainly suggest that they take

351
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:25,120
our broad overview course which is

352
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:27,440
cannabis biology society and industry

353
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,120
which will give them that base

354
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,160
foundation

355
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,799
across

356
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:35,360
many different areas of the industry i

357
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:38,000
teach a course in the fall called hemp

358
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,399
production systems and this is a really

359
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,399
hands-on class where

360
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:45,679
we learn about the biology the

361
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:48,000
physiology cultivation practices for

362
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:50,479
cannabis we do visit

363
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,278
field sites as well as the trials that

364
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:55,920
we have on our research farms and in our

365
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:58,720
greenhouses here at cornell so again

366
00:14:55,919 --> 00:15:01,360
that extensive research team that we

367
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,759
have here is doing a lot of great work

368
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,879
that our students get first-hand

369
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:09,759
experience with we walk through

370
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:11,439
propagation practices like germination

371
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:13,600
and cloning as well

372
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,519
as fertilization

373
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,480
all the way up through harvest in that

374
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,799
class

375
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,199
so students who are really interested in

376
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:24,078
cultivation side i might recommend that

377
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:27,759
in that fall semester they also take

378
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:30,638
our courses on plant propagation

379
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:32,958
and on hydroponic production so our

380
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:36,480
plant propagation goes a lot

381
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:38,958
in more in depth into best practices for

382
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,039
clonal propagation as well as really

383
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:42,239
important emerging areas like tissue

384
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:44,319
culture

385
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,198
and then hydroponic production covers

386
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:50,399
all the best practices for controlled

387
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:51,758
environment agriculture

388
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,399
in the

389
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:56,480
spring semester students would also have

390
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,839
the opportunity to take some really

391
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,959
important prac

392
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:03,920
courses for cultivators like integrated

393
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:03,919
pest management

394
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,519
that's a very important topic in

395
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,919
today's society as and you know someone

396
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:13,519
who's an entomologist yourself i'm i'm

397
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:15,759
sure you're quite aware of all the

398
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:17,278
challenges that we're facing right now

399
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,159
in the industry

400
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:19,519
um

401
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:21,039
so that's that's wonderful i mean i'm

402
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,320
looking at this list of classes and it's

403
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:23,679
quite extensive there's quite a few

404
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,720
classes in here that i think i would

405
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:27,198
find

406
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,879
quite interesting

407
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:31,120
and then along with the classes you

408
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:33,519
mentioned greenhouse

409
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,120
field rows and then i know you mentioned

410
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:38,879
to me you have growth chambers too so

411
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:41,278
there's quite a bit of range in terms of

412
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:42,240
the ability for a student to have access

413
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:44,720
to

414
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:47,839
different different methods for

415
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:49,680
research i guess or growing styles

416
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,199
absolutely yeah so one thing that

417
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:52,879
differentiates

418
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:56,639
a lot of

419
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:59,439
our curriculum from other universities

420
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:03,039
is this ability to get really hands-on

421
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,558
in so many different areas so students

422
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:06,798
are growing

423
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:08,720
their own hemp in

424
00:17:06,798 --> 00:17:11,918
for example the hydroponic production

425
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:14,720
lab or in my hemp production systems

426
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:16,799
course they're actually you know

427
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,959
designing their own systems and taking

428
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:20,798
those the whole way to harvest and

429
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,000
exploring how different cultivation

430
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:25,199
practices

431
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:28,000
influence yields influence plant

432
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:31,440
phenotype influence the

433
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,038
cannabinoid profiles of flowers in the

434
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,919
processing class

435
00:17:33,038 --> 00:17:39,119
students learn how to use an hplc and

436
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:42,640
actually do sample prep and run samples

437
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:44,479
in that class we get hands-on with

438
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,679
decortication so

439
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,519
that's the extraction of those fibers

440
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:53,440
from the stems

441
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:55,599
of fiber cultivars we do grain cleaning

442
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:59,200
and sorting so we can learn how hemp

443
00:17:55,599 --> 00:18:00,558
heart products are made as well as press

444
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,160
cold pressed

445
00:18:00,558 --> 00:18:05,759
hemp seed oil

446
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:07,120
there's tons of hands-on experience that

447
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:09,919
is able to

448
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:12,959
leverage a lot of the research capacity

449
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:12,960
that we have here

450
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:16,879
now this is kind of an out of the blue

451
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,440
question but do you have anything on the

452
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:22,400
organic side for folks like myself that

453
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,400
tend to have an emphasis on that

454
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:28,798
yeah so organic production is certainly

455
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:32,320
covered as a focus area in many of our

456
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:34,000
courses and we do have several courses

457
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:37,038
so i mentioned there's this opportunity

458
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,919
for students to customize so there are

459
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:42,960
courses on organic production that

460
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:45,280
students could add we also have some

461
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:48,240
that are even not more broad focused

462
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:49,759
including agroecology or even soil

463
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,599
ecology

464
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:53,359
oh that's wonderful

465
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:55,678
well uh

466
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:57,359
talk to me a little bit about the

467
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,120
industry partners that you're currently

468
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:01,199
working with and how that might tie into

469
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:02,798
research projects

470
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,038
yeah so i mentioned

471
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:06,319
earlier that our ability to cover this

472
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:09,038
huge array

473
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:10,399
of different topics for students is not

474
00:19:09,038 --> 00:19:13,359
only

475
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:16,400
due to our great research faculty that

476
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:19,918
are involved with our courses but also

477
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:22,400
our industry partners so we have great

478
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,960
connections with folks in industry who

479
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,640
come in to share their knowledge with

480
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,919
students throughout

481
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,799
the courses or

482
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:34,320
in when when the conditions allow given

483
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:38,160
covid um we also have the opportunity to

484
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:39,918
go visit them on site as well but in

485
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:44,160
some examples of this actually speaking

486
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:46,480
of covid is we are online now uh for our

487
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,880
first two weeks of the spring semester

488
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:51,440
which was an unexpected change and

489
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,679
normally when my labs for hemp

490
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:56,360
processing are doing some pretty

491
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:59,038
intensive cannabis anatomy

492
00:19:56,359 --> 00:20:01,759
explorations and dissections to

493
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:04,558
understand so the underlying structures

494
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:05,839
that produce different hemp products so

495
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:07,918
because we already have these great

496
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:09,199
connections with folks in the industry i

497
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:12,799
was able to

498
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:14,400
call in my friends over at grow doc and

499
00:20:12,798 --> 00:20:16,960
they're pinch hitting for me in my

500
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,919
online labs now so they have

501
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,079
a

502
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:22,559
tech platform that's an app that allows

503
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:24,879
growers to diagnose different nutrient

504
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:26,798
deficiencies and one of the features

505
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,039
that they're working on is also the

506
00:20:26,798 --> 00:20:31,918
ability to

507
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:33,759
use images in that are captured in the

508
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,400
app to understand whether your plants

509
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:37,359
are

510
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,759
male or female based on their early

511
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:42,798
flower development so we're going to

512
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:44,720
work with them in the online first two

513
00:20:42,798 --> 00:20:45,918
weeks of lab

514
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,319
and then that's going to be followed

515
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:51,360
hopefully when we're back in person

516
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:52,558
again learning some of the lab skills

517
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:54,719
that are really critical for the

518
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:56,798
industry with a collaboration with

519
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,038
medicinal genomics so all of that plant

520
00:20:56,798 --> 00:21:01,038
material that students worked with in

521
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:02,798
the online portion

522
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:05,519
of the class will

523
00:21:02,798 --> 00:21:08,319
be brought back to the classroom and

524
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:10,879
then we'll take samples of that and run

525
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:13,678
some of the medicinal genomics

526
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:16,400
sex testing kits and also learn how to

527
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:18,880
apply those kits for detecting pathogens

528
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:21,519
that can be really important for growers

529
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,760
we also have great collaborations with

530
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:26,720
folks who are on the analytical

531
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:29,440
chemistry side of the spectrum so one

532
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,038
great solution for

533
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,840
small-scale cultivators who are

534
00:21:31,038 --> 00:21:37,038
interested in tracking their cannabinoid

535
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:39,119
profiles and their terpene profiles as

536
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:42,319
well as some products that are offered

537
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:47,519
by a company called lucidity so these

538
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:49,439
are small scale versions of plcs and gcs

539
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:51,279
and we'll have the opportunity to work

540
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,519
with their

541
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:57,440
equipment in class which is all of the

542
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:59,759
precision of a full bench top scale gc

543
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,200
but with a much smaller

544
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:03,519
footprint

545
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,640
and i think potentially even more of

546
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:07,359
interest

547
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:09,520
for uh cultivators who are listening in

548
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:12,399
on this is some of the other even more

549
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:14,879
portable and point of use testing

550
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:17,440
systems that we teach students how to

551
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:20,480
use in the lab

552
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:22,320
although they're you know so easy to use

553
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,159
that you certainly don't need a full

554
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:25,599
course in analytical chemistry to use

555
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:28,320
them so

556
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:30,319
an option in that arena is the light lab

557
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:33,200
which is offered by a company called

558
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:35,119
orange photonics so we work with orange

559
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,319
photonics to

560
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:40,239
teach the technology that they offer so

561
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:43,119
that's sort of a point of use hplc

562
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:46,319
system it comes in essentially like a

563
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:49,678
small suitcase and takes only a few

564
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:52,319
minutes to prep and run a sample so if

565
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:55,360
you're thinking about harvest timing for

566
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:56,319
example you could bring this with you

567
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:59,918
into

568
00:22:56,319 --> 00:23:02,879
the grow room or into the greenhouse and

569
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:04,559
take a small sample of plant tissue it

570
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,960
does work better when it's dried but you

571
00:23:04,558 --> 00:23:09,440
can certainly do it fresh if you have a

572
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,279
good approximation of

573
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,919
the moisture content of your sample and

574
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:16,079
run it right there to understand what

575
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,320
your cannabinoid profile of your plant

576
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:21,678
is right in that moment

577
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:23,918
rather than waiting to send samples off

578
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:25,440
to a lab or even taking them to your own

579
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:27,600
in-house lab

580
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,279
and still taking a few hours to run

581
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:31,359
those so

582
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:33,200
all of these collaborations that

583
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:36,959
students are

584
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:38,240
learning in the courses they can then

585
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,798
take advantage of when they're

586
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:43,038
developing their capstone project and we

587
00:23:40,798 --> 00:23:45,038
did have a really nice one with the

588
00:23:43,038 --> 00:23:46,240
folks at orange photonic

589
00:23:45,038 --> 00:23:49,599
using

590
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:52,240
their light lab to develop a new

591
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:54,079
application for chemotyping so a

592
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,159
chemotype is

593
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:59,278
identifying the dominant cannabinoid

594
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:01,360
profile of a plant which often you need

595
00:23:59,278 --> 00:24:03,919
to wait to do until that plant has

596
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:06,719
initiated the flowering phase but we

597
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:09,038
were able to develop some new methods

598
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:12,880
and then new application for

599
00:24:09,038 --> 00:24:15,278
their equipment that can test very very

600
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:17,919
young plants which would be

601
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:20,480
a great option for folks who are pheno

602
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:22,400
hunting out there

603
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,000
yeah that's really cool i think when we

604
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,240
were on the phone earlier you mentioned

605
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,558
there were some other technologies uh

606
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,319
similar to this too

607
00:24:28,558 --> 00:24:32,879
could you touch it yeah so

608
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:36,480
i can certainly talk about those so

609
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:38,080
um there are a couple technologies now

610
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:42,079
that are getting

611
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:44,240
even faster and even less destructive so

612
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:48,639
anytime you take a sample

613
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:51,919
for hplc or lc analysis you do need to

614
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:55,038
take that tissue off the plant grind it

615
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:58,880
up extract it with solvent but there are

616
00:24:55,038 --> 00:25:03,119
some new platforms out there that use

617
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:06,240
spectroscopy so they're using nir

618
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:09,359
and other similar technologies with

619
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:11,120
really truly handheld applications that

620
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:15,199
can allow you to

621
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:18,158
scan plant material and right away link

622
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:21,200
that to a database that will tell you

623
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:24,240
what the cannabinoid profile or terpene

624
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:26,558
profile or really i think the there's

625
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:29,440
very few limitations on

626
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:32,319
the kind of information that can be

627
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,600
generated with those systems so if folks

628
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:34,798
are thinking

629
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:36,719
that they want to explore that

630
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:39,519
technology more i would say a good

631
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:41,360
example of that is

632
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:43,839
from mariposa

633
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:45,839
a company that's offering one of these

634
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:49,119
handheld

635
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:52,240
scanners that then links up with their

636
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:54,158
database in order to be able to identify

637
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:57,200
the signatures that are generated from

638
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:58,480
that handheld module

639
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,200
are you finding that they're pretty

640
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:03,360
accurate like they correlate well with

641
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,840
hplc and some of these other

642
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:07,359
more traditional methods

643
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:11,439
so when folks have compared these

644
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:13,278
methods to hplc they do compare very

645
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:16,480
well and part of the reason for that is

646
00:26:13,278 --> 00:26:19,599
because we use a whole lot of background

647
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:22,319
testing of plants that were

648
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:24,719
tested with hplc and these other more

649
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:28,079
industry standard regulatory testing

650
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:31,600
methods to develop the databases that

651
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:33,359
are then used in order to make these

652
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:35,678
real-time predictions of what's

653
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:38,719
happening with plants that are being

654
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:42,000
scanned so um

655
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:44,079
there there's a high correlation among

656
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,558
those readings but of course

657
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:48,720
as you know those those models are only

658
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:50,240
as good as the data that goes in so

659
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,798
that's one area that we're really

660
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,558
excited about working with companies and

661
00:26:52,798 --> 00:26:56,079
with students in our capstone projects

662
00:26:54,558 --> 00:26:58,960
to develop

663
00:26:56,079 --> 00:27:02,079
some of those new data sets that are

664
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:05,120
needed to answer additional questions

665
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:07,599
so of course we are always excited about

666
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:08,558
new industry partnerships

667
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:10,558
that

668
00:27:08,558 --> 00:27:12,319
folks may be interested in so please get

669
00:27:10,558 --> 00:27:14,000
in touch if you if you have a good

670
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:16,158
research idea

671
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,960
and want to work with us and work with a

672
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:22,159
student so our students are always

673
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:23,200
paired up with a faculty mentor

674
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:25,919
in

675
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,600
their area of expertise and sometimes

676
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:29,278
they are you know they just work alone

677
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:30,319
with that mentor on a particular

678
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:33,038
research

679
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:36,319
topic but we really do encourage the

680
00:27:33,038 --> 00:27:39,759
students to also

681
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:42,960
align with an industry partner to answer

682
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:45,359
a question that's relevant not only to

683
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:48,640
the student and advancing our knowledge

684
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:51,759
more broadly as a field but also to

685
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:53,919
solving some problems that are real on

686
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:55,919
the ground issues for cultivators and

687
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:57,360
processors

688
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:00,240
yeah that's huge because traditionally

689
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:02,798
there's been a big gap between

690
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,079
academia and uh

691
00:28:02,798 --> 00:28:06,240
real life

692
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:07,519
you know farmers and so

693
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,960
being able to bridge that and have

694
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:10,480
projects that address some of the

695
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,319
problems that you know farmers and

696
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,159
growers are actually seeing in the field

697
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:17,439
or in the

698
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:19,520
in their facilities is is amazing i am

699
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,440
hopeful that you know you and i talked

700
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:22,960
that we might be able to collaborate on

701
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,480
a few things or i could connect you with

702
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,000
some of the facilities that i'm working

703
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,839
with that would be interesting doing

704
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,319
research if some of your students down

705
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:32,158
the road had a passion for you know the

706
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:34,319
sorts of things that we're

707
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,360
we're working on so i'm really excited

708
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:36,319
for that

709
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:38,000
um

710
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:39,678
one question

711
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,240
one question i had while you were

712
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:44,159
talking about covid and and everything

713
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:46,480
and i was thinking okay if i'm

714
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:48,559
if i'm if i'm interested in this program

715
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:51,038
um one thing we didn't address is do i

716
00:28:48,558 --> 00:28:52,798
need to move to new york or how are

717
00:28:51,038 --> 00:28:55,038
people doing this that like have

718
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:56,480
families and lives and they're located

719
00:28:55,038 --> 00:28:58,480
in other areas around the country is

720
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,440
that still an option for them to take

721
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,278
this

722
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,519
take this program

723
00:29:01,278 --> 00:29:05,919
so i guess this is a double-edged sword

724
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:07,200
because the one thing that makes our

725
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:09,200
program

726
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,159
in terms of the mps degree

727
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,519
so

728
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:17,919
distinct and have so much value is this

729
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:21,200
hands-on experience so we do have

730
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:23,840
students who are enrolled in our program

731
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:25,679
that don't live in

732
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:29,038
up you know upstate new york here in

733
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:30,399
ithaca where our main campus is

734
00:29:29,038 --> 00:29:32,319
but

735
00:29:30,398 --> 00:29:35,119
over the past two years we've had a lot

736
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:38,079
more flexibility in terms of offering

737
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:40,959
um options that are in person as well as

738
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:43,759
those that are online

739
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,360
and you know we definitely encourage

740
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:48,480
students to come here to get the

741
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:49,519
opportunity to interact with our faculty

742
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,919
to

743
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:55,038
get their hands wet in a bunch of the

744
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:57,360
different research labs on campus and to

745
00:29:55,038 --> 00:29:59,919
get that hands-on experience that's so

746
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:01,918
critical for demonstrating

747
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:04,399
that there's mastery of all of these

748
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:07,759
different skills but we are working

749
00:30:04,398 --> 00:30:11,359
right now to develop some online content

750
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:13,038
so the online courses that are

751
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:16,000
essentially the equivalent versions but

752
00:30:13,038 --> 00:30:19,200
without the hands-on experience that we

753
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:22,079
have are not the on the master's degree

754
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:25,038
granting track but they are certificate

755
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:27,439
programs and a great example of that is

756
00:30:25,038 --> 00:30:30,079
um one of the courses that we offer in

757
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:33,519
the spring semester is led by dr larry

758
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:34,798
smart on hemp breeding and genetics and

759
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:36,639
he has

760
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:39,599
been the first one to launch his course

761
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,480
online through e cornell so students can

762
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:43,439
go

763
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:47,360
to ecornell if they can't physically

764
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:48,640
come here to campus and take the same

765
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:51,519
content

766
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:55,200
that he offers in his in-person version

767
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:56,798
but just online without the hands-on

768
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,558
activities

769
00:30:56,798 --> 00:31:00,319
has anyone done sort of a hybrid model

770
00:30:58,558 --> 00:31:01,359
where they come down for a quarter or a

771
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:03,519
semester

772
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:05,759
sort of thing is that a possibility with

773
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:07,120
your program or is it is it pretty much

774
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:09,519
um

775
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:10,319
you need to you need to be hands-on

776
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,919
uh

777
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:13,200
are you guys on quarters or semesters i

778
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:16,320
don't even know which

779
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,600
we we're on a semester system uh okay so

780
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:19,119
every semester do they need would they

781
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:22,000
need to be there for both semesters or

782
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:22,000
could they come down or

783
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:26,000
so

784
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,640
it's

785
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,640
very much encouraged but i think we're

786
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,720
really sensitive to

787
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,600
the different constraints on

788
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,679
um

789
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:38,480
on individuals that may want to

790
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:40,159
participate in the program so

791
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,919
it's potentially possible that there is

792
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:44,000
some flexibility and we have a student

793
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:47,200
that's participating in the program from

794
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,759
new york city right now which is not a

795
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:52,798
short drive from ithaca by any means

796
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:56,000
okay but you know they come to ithaca

797
00:31:52,798 --> 00:31:58,240
for all of the big hands-on components

798
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,839
so that is that is overall pretty

799
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,399
critical um

800
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:05,038
although we do have students who

801
00:32:02,398 --> 00:32:08,319
leave ithaca that are in our program to

802
00:32:05,038 --> 00:32:11,599
complete their acton projects so

803
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:12,480
last year i had a student that was able

804
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:15,678
to

805
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:18,079
go to italy and explore different fiber

806
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:20,720
production models

807
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:21,918
traveling all across italy

808
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:25,200
with

809
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:27,360
a company called hemp south techno

810
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,919
and this year i'll have a student that's

811
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:32,079
going down to north carolina and

812
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:34,480
virginia to again work with another

813
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:38,000
fiber company helping them with field

814
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:41,440
trials so there's opportunity for folks

815
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:44,640
to not be in ithaca but at least for the

816
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:46,720
the course work part of things

817
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:49,360
it's very much encouraged that you're

818
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:52,640
here and able to get the most out of the

819
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:54,079
hands-on experiences that we're offering

820
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,360
great i mean that makes a lot of sense i

821
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:57,278
just thought i'd ask that question in

822
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:59,599
case there were people who were

823
00:32:57,278 --> 00:33:01,919
curious um

824
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:03,678
let's talk about these capstone projects

825
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:05,440
because you had listed some pretty

826
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:07,840
interesting research that your students

827
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,360
have already done and some other things

828
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:10,639
that are you know maybe coming down the

829
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:13,038
pipeline

830
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:15,120
what are some examples of uh you know

831
00:33:13,038 --> 00:33:17,519
cool research that has come out of your

832
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:21,599
program over the years

833
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:24,880
so students are really encouraged to

834
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:28,240
develop a capstone project that is in

835
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:31,600
alignment with their career goals

836
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:34,240
and also takes advantage of the

837
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:36,398
expertise and all of the resources that

838
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:39,679
we have on campus you mentioned our

839
00:33:36,398 --> 00:33:41,918
research farms that we have here as well

840
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:45,038
as our greenhouses

841
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:47,600
and growth chambers and

842
00:33:45,038 --> 00:33:50,158
also to leverage our collaborations with

843
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:53,359
industry partners and i think a great

844
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:56,640
example of this is a student who also

845
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:57,678
finished last year who i think you may

846
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,519
talk to

847
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:02,399
in future so i won't give away too much

848
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:05,359
but andre gollich who

849
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:08,078
had took this observation from his

850
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:11,759
interactions with a grower

851
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:14,399
in vermont about frost stress and cold

852
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:17,119
tolerance of hemp and

853
00:34:14,398 --> 00:34:19,679
developed that into a really interesting

854
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:21,119
line of inquiry exploring how frost

855
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:24,559
influences

856
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:27,599
the development of hemp plants both

857
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:30,960
fiber plants as well as high cannabinoid

858
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:34,079
cultivars and how that influences the

859
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:35,199
cannabinoid profiles of those plants as

860
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:37,760
well so

861
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:39,759
that's one great example we also have

862
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,560
students that are interested much more

863
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,240
in

864
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:47,119
working with growers from a consultation

865
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:49,439
or extension focus so we've had students

866
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:51,919
who have paired up with

867
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:54,878
extension professionals within the

868
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:58,559
cornell cooperative extension network to

869
00:34:54,878 --> 00:35:00,880
build surveys that help us to understand

870
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:03,679
what grower needs are

871
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,960
so that we can target our research but

872
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:06,239
also so that they can get some

873
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:09,679
experience

874
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:12,399
understanding how to assess growers

875
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:15,199
needs within the industry and how to

876
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,639
communicate science with them

877
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:19,519
and so speaking of that we have a we

878
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:22,239
have a student right now who is working

879
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:25,280
with one of our extension professionals

880
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:26,078
to develop a best practices guide

881
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,040
for

882
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:31,839
hemp cultivation in the northeast and so

883
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:34,239
for his capstone project he decided to

884
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:35,838
take a bite-sized chunk out of that

885
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:38,799
production guide although it's quite a

886
00:35:35,838 --> 00:35:41,279
big bite and focus on the controlled

887
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:44,160
environment cultivation so

888
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:46,800
he's going to synthesize all of the

889
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:48,559
science that is being generated every

890
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,480
day there's more and more

891
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:52,239
peer-reviewed publications that are

892
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:55,119
coming out as well

893
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:56,639
as trials that are published

894
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:58,880
based on different university programs

895
00:35:56,639 --> 00:36:01,679
so he's going to synthesize that and

896
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:03,760
also go out and do some interviews with

897
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:07,118
growers to see what practices they're

898
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:09,599
using on the ground and understand what

899
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:11,920
questions and major limitations they

900
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:15,359
might have so that we can continue to

901
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:17,599
develop that guide in the future

902
00:36:15,358 --> 00:36:20,239
that's wonderful yeah i actually

903
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:22,880
connected on linkedin with uh connor

904
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:25,358
steven who just graduated your program

905
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:27,200
yeah as another person to mention

906
00:36:25,358 --> 00:36:29,199
so it's wonderful to see

907
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:33,199
these people moving into the industry

908
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:35,199
and having positive roles and impact

909
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:38,078
pretty much right away so

910
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:38,078
yeah it's great

911
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:44,000
um let's see here so

912
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,760
beyond the growth uh or sorry not the

913
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,599
growth chamber but the capstone

914
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,280
projects um were there any more you want

915
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:51,039
to mention there or did you want to dive

916
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:53,119
into a little bit of your own research

917
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:55,519
and how you got into this

918
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:57,760
yeah i think this is a great time to to

919
00:36:55,519 --> 00:36:58,719
make that transition and

920
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,000
um

921
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:02,239
i feel

922
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,199
very blessed every day that this is my

923
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:04,319
job

924
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:05,838
because

925
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:08,720
i love

926
00:37:05,838 --> 00:37:11,519
teaching and my my really my favorite

927
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:12,480
thing about my job is mentoring students

928
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:15,199
in

929
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:17,280
areas of of research where we have

930
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:21,118
overlap and so my background you

931
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:22,880
mentioned earlier is in entomology and

932
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:25,280
one of the things that got me excited

933
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:27,680
about working with hemp and then

934
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:29,920
transitioning to working much more with

935
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:32,000
high cannabinoid cultivars

936
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,519
normally i think of as cannabis

937
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:38,079
is um

938
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:39,679
understanding the environmental impact

939
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:43,760
cannabis especially cannabis that's

940
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:46,239
grown indoors gets a bad rap in terms of

941
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:48,800
its environmental impacts but there's

942
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:51,519
also a ton of benefits

943
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:54,640
to cannabis production when it comes to

944
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:57,199
fiber and grain so there's a lot of

945
00:37:54,639 --> 00:38:00,319
researchers that are working on

946
00:37:57,199 --> 00:38:03,519
understanding the ability of

947
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:06,720
industrial hemp cultivation to sequester

948
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:09,440
carbon but one of the areas that i've

949
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:11,598
done a little bit of work in is in how

950
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:14,000
hemp can actually provide

951
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:16,320
a resource for

952
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,239
insect populations that we might be

953
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:21,760
concerned about from a conservation

954
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:25,759
perspective and again this was a project

955
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:27,359
that was really student motivated

956
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,720
so one of the students i was working

957
00:38:27,358 --> 00:38:31,759
with at the time

958
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:34,399
was an undergrad nate flicker

959
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:36,800
wanted to work on hemp we've been doing

960
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,920
a bunch of small farm survey work around

961
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,119
the region

962
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,559
and

963
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:43,119
convinced me that this was something

964
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:46,960
that we should go out and look at and so

965
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:48,960
nate and i developed a project to survey

966
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:52,000
the insect community

967
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:54,240
of fiber hemp and grain hemp growing

968
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,400
within the region

969
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:59,199
mostly because we had

970
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:01,760
heard a lot from our grower

971
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:05,439
collaborators that they were seeing a

972
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:07,040
ton of bees out there on their fiber and

973
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,000
grain plantings

974
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:10,239
and

975
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,880
fiber and grain

976
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:15,439
hemp in general does not have big showy

977
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:17,838
flowers compared to other props you know

978
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:20,240
like if you imagine walking into an

979
00:39:17,838 --> 00:39:21,759
apple orchard or an almond orchard in

980
00:39:20,239 --> 00:39:24,319
full bloom and there's flowers

981
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:26,880
everywhere they're much more subtle so

982
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:29,519
they were really curious about why these

983
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:32,400
insects were there

984
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:34,239
and and also what kind of insects were

985
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:36,320
there some are there some that we might

986
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:37,679
be concerned about so we did some

987
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,240
surveys

988
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:43,118
and we ended up narrowing our focus down

989
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:45,439
to looking at the the bees that were

990
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:49,200
visiting these plots and found a

991
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:52,960
surprisingly diverse community including

992
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:55,118
many native wild pollinators

993
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:57,440
what that we are potentially concerned

994
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:59,760
about in terms of their populations and

995
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:01,679
the impact of agriculture and climate

996
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,839
change and other factors

997
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:05,919
so of course there were honeybees there

998
00:40:03,838 --> 00:40:09,358
but honeybees are non-native

999
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:11,358
in north america so there was also

1000
00:40:09,358 --> 00:40:14,159
a really common visitor that which is

1001
00:40:11,358 --> 00:40:16,559
called the common eastern bumblebee

1002
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:18,159
one of our larger bee species we have as

1003
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:20,719
well as carpenter bees that we're

1004
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:23,838
visiting all the way down to tiny

1005
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:27,118
itty-bitty little sweat bees so they

1006
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:30,078
span the full gamut of different sizes

1007
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:31,200
different colors of these that are all

1008
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:33,680
using

1009
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:36,159
the industrial hemp as a resource and

1010
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:40,399
what they're actually doing is they are

1011
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:43,279
collecting pollen from the male plants

1012
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:46,318
in these industrial hemp plantings

1013
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:47,920
so if you were growing high cannabinoid

1014
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:49,679
hemp and you happen to have a male

1015
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:53,039
although we all hope that that's not the

1016
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:55,919
case you would very likely also see

1017
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:59,440
these wild bees showing up and

1018
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:03,280
collecting some of that pollen from your

1019
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:03,280
male pollen producing plants

1020
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,519
yeah now

1021
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,720
you speculate a little bit about why

1022
00:41:07,519 --> 00:41:10,318
they were

1023
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:13,358
there were so many

1024
00:41:10,318 --> 00:41:15,599
bees showing up on these male plants

1025
00:41:13,358 --> 00:41:18,719
do you want to touch on that

1026
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:22,400
absolutely so anyone who has encountered

1027
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:25,759
a male hemp plant before knows that they

1028
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:28,880
produce astounding amounts of pollen

1029
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:32,400
from an individual plant so

1030
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:34,960
one aspect is just this volume of pollen

1031
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:37,039
that's being produced during the

1032
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:39,280
mid-summer period

1033
00:41:37,039 --> 00:41:41,920
and if you think about it the mid-summer

1034
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:44,240
when it's dry is actually a time when

1035
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:47,760
there are very few other

1036
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:50,959
flowers that are blooming abundantly so

1037
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:53,359
even though industrial hemp only offers

1038
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:56,240
pollen from these male plants neither

1039
00:41:53,358 --> 00:41:59,358
the male or the female plants offer any

1040
00:41:56,239 --> 00:42:02,159
nectar resources for bees because there

1041
00:41:59,358 --> 00:42:04,639
are relatively few other floral

1042
00:42:02,159 --> 00:42:06,960
resources out there for them during this

1043
00:42:04,639 --> 00:42:09,838
mid-summer gap period

1044
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:13,119
they're able to pretty quickly learn

1045
00:42:09,838 --> 00:42:15,679
to go visit these hemp plants as a

1046
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:18,000
source of pollen

1047
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:21,039
and the hemp plants do contain

1048
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:23,199
cannabinoids in their pollen although it

1049
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:24,159
is at relatively

1050
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:27,759
low

1051
00:42:24,159 --> 00:42:30,559
levels so we had a lot of interest from

1052
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:33,040
beekeepers who were worried that their

1053
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:35,519
fees or some cases were maybe excited

1054
00:42:33,039 --> 00:42:36,880
about the potential for their bees to be

1055
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:38,800
bringing back

1056
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:41,039
all of these cannabinoids and then

1057
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:42,800
incorporating those into hive products

1058
00:42:41,039 --> 00:42:44,400
that they might be selling

1059
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:47,440
like beeswax

1060
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:50,079
or propolis or pollens or importantly

1061
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:52,159
honey but what we found from

1062
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:54,000
looking at the levels of cannabinoids in

1063
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:56,078
those hive products

1064
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:59,440
is that you would have to eat an

1065
00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:01,039
enormous amount of either the pollens

1066
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:03,920
directly or

1067
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:06,559
the honey in order to get anything near

1068
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:09,039
a recommended ghost

1069
00:43:06,559 --> 00:43:11,358
yeah you had said like

1070
00:43:09,039 --> 00:43:12,960
pat in pounds or in gallons it was a

1071
00:43:11,358 --> 00:43:14,799
ridiculous number like more than any

1072
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:16,480
human could ever consume

1073
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:18,318
in a year much yes

1074
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:20,639
in terms of pollen because that's where

1075
00:43:18,318 --> 00:43:24,079
it's the most concentrated

1076
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:26,639
and again cannabinoids are lipophilic so

1077
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:29,039
they really like to go into those fatty

1078
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:32,000
substances

1079
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:34,639
it can you'd have to eat about 75 pounds

1080
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:37,440
to get an effective dose and in terms of

1081
00:43:34,639 --> 00:43:38,559
honey because again honey is not high in

1082
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:41,519
lipids so

1083
00:43:38,559 --> 00:43:43,920
there's not a lot of cannabinoids that

1084
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:47,039
are extracted into the honey you'd have

1085
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:49,119
to eat well over 2000 pounds of honey

1086
00:43:47,039 --> 00:43:51,358
you would almost certainly die from

1087
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:53,358
eating that amount of honey before you

1088
00:43:51,358 --> 00:43:55,039
got high from it

1089
00:43:53,358 --> 00:43:57,358
now that's a good thing because if we

1090
00:43:55,039 --> 00:43:58,800
were finding the thc showing up in the

1091
00:43:57,358 --> 00:44:00,960
honey that would have created a whole

1092
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:03,039
bunch of regulatory issues and

1093
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:05,679
nightmares for

1094
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:07,358
honey producers and also for people

1095
00:44:05,679 --> 00:44:09,358
wanting to grow

1096
00:44:07,358 --> 00:44:10,960
cannabis or hemp so this is a this is

1097
00:44:09,358 --> 00:44:12,078
good finding in a lot of ways i would

1098
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,760
say

1099
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:15,519
absolutely i'm sure there were one or

1100
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:17,520
two other

1101
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:19,199
entrepreneurial beekeepers out there who

1102
00:44:17,519 --> 00:44:21,838
were a little disappointed by those

1103
00:44:19,199 --> 00:44:24,239
results but i think overall a big sigh

1104
00:44:21,838 --> 00:44:26,880
of relief from many in the beekeeping

1105
00:44:24,239 --> 00:44:29,919
side of the industry

1106
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:31,599
yeah and as someone who formerly had

1107
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:34,079
honeybees um

1108
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:36,160
they're amazing creatures i was told

1109
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:38,640
that a honeybee could fly away out you

1110
00:44:36,159 --> 00:44:41,199
know two to three miles away from a hive

1111
00:44:38,639 --> 00:44:42,960
on a day come back find a nectar or

1112
00:44:41,199 --> 00:44:45,838
pollen source or something a resource

1113
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,960
for the hive fly back do a little dance

1114
00:44:45,838 --> 00:44:49,039
in front of the hive and that would

1115
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:52,079
actually be able to tell other

1116
00:44:49,039 --> 00:44:53,679
bees where to go to find the same

1117
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:56,880
resource

1118
00:44:53,679 --> 00:44:58,879
is that you have you have been told the

1119
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:01,440
correct story

1120
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:02,240
so yeah that's exactly what honey bees

1121
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:06,720
do

1122
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:09,679
bees are incredibly smart creatures so

1123
00:45:06,719 --> 00:45:12,480
not only are they able to stumble upon

1124
00:45:09,679 --> 00:45:14,639
this brand new pollen resource in their

1125
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:16,559
environment and learn that it actually

1126
00:45:14,639 --> 00:45:19,759
is something that's worth their while to

1127
00:45:16,559 --> 00:45:22,639
forward for they can also go back to

1128
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:25,119
their hives communicate the location of

1129
00:45:22,639 --> 00:45:29,199
that resources and recruit additional

1130
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:31,599
foragers to those sites so yeah they're

1131
00:45:29,199 --> 00:45:32,719
certainly very very intelligent little

1132
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:35,440
creatures

1133
00:45:32,719 --> 00:45:38,239
and because you know they're they're out

1134
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:40,480
there trying to forage as efficiently as

1135
00:45:38,239 --> 00:45:43,838
possible they learn

1136
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:44,800
very very quickly that it's only the

1137
00:45:43,838 --> 00:45:47,679
male

1138
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:50,240
plant only those male and fluorescences

1139
00:45:47,679 --> 00:45:53,039
that are providing that pollen resource

1140
00:45:50,239 --> 00:45:55,598
so in all of our survey work

1141
00:45:53,039 --> 00:45:57,199
across many many different fields and

1142
00:45:55,599 --> 00:46:02,318
farms

1143
00:45:57,199 --> 00:46:04,399
we really never saw any bees going to

1144
00:46:02,318 --> 00:46:06,159
female flowers

1145
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:09,280
even though these are plants that were

1146
00:46:06,159 --> 00:46:12,639
grown in mixed male and female stands

1147
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:15,519
for fiber and grain production so

1148
00:46:12,639 --> 00:46:18,078
they're not making those mistakes that

1149
00:46:15,519 --> 00:46:20,000
may potentially result in the

1150
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:22,480
transmission of pollen

1151
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:25,280
from let's say you know your neighbors

1152
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:28,559
plants who maybe bought some seeds

1153
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:30,240
online to the plants that you might be

1154
00:46:28,559 --> 00:46:32,719
cultivating so

1155
00:46:30,239 --> 00:46:35,199
if there is male plants in the vicinity

1156
00:46:32,719 --> 00:46:37,199
and you get pollination it's almost

1157
00:46:35,199 --> 00:46:39,358
certainly because of the wind and not

1158
00:46:37,199 --> 00:46:42,559
because of the bees so if you see a male

1159
00:46:39,358 --> 00:46:44,799
plant nearby with bees on it you already

1160
00:46:42,559 --> 00:46:46,480
have a big problem

1161
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:48,240
that's good so it's not the bee's fault

1162
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:51,119
if your plant gets pollinated it's the

1163
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:54,318
wind yeah or your neighborhood even

1164
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:56,559
even if it's not a great outcome for you

1165
00:46:54,318 --> 00:46:58,480
at least the bees get you know a little

1166
00:46:56,559 --> 00:47:02,078
bit of the silver lining in there so

1167
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:03,838
that viral video of a you know almost

1168
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:05,359
harvestable

1169
00:47:03,838 --> 00:47:07,920
female uh

1170
00:47:05,358 --> 00:47:10,239
plant uh cannabis plant that that was

1171
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:12,639
covered in bees

1172
00:47:10,239 --> 00:47:14,639
is really not anything we're seeing

1173
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:17,598
occurring in nature they may have used

1174
00:47:14,639 --> 00:47:18,719
some sort of attractant or

1175
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:20,160
it might have it didn't look like a

1176
00:47:18,719 --> 00:47:21,679
swarm to me

1177
00:47:20,159 --> 00:47:23,358
from the photo but

1178
00:47:21,679 --> 00:47:24,879
yeah i know you you and i talked about

1179
00:47:23,358 --> 00:47:26,078
this because you'd seen the photo too

1180
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,760
but there was a lot of speculation

1181
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:29,760
around it that we were going to have

1182
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:31,520
bees that were high which

1183
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:33,520
we should talk about you should tell me

1184
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:34,800
what you shared on that too but also

1185
00:47:33,519 --> 00:47:36,480
that you know we're going to have honey

1186
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,559
that was going to make you high and all

1187
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:40,400
this other stuff so if you could dispel

1188
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:43,680
some of those things

1189
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:46,880
yeah absolutely so i've never seen that

1190
00:47:43,679 --> 00:47:49,519
happening um in all of my observations

1191
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:52,160
of bees on hemp over the past several

1192
00:47:49,519 --> 00:47:54,480
years however you know it's it's

1193
00:47:52,159 --> 00:47:57,199
possible that it could have happened in

1194
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:59,760
a you know organic manner you know

1195
00:47:57,199 --> 00:48:01,598
without maybe people applied some sort

1196
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:03,680
of attractant which there certainly are

1197
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:07,359
attractants that can be applied

1198
00:48:03,679 --> 00:48:09,838
to flowers but there is two potential

1199
00:48:07,358 --> 00:48:12,318
although somewhat unlikely

1200
00:48:09,838 --> 00:48:14,318
options one is that

1201
00:48:12,318 --> 00:48:17,599
those honeybees were going

1202
00:48:14,318 --> 00:48:20,239
and collecting the glandular trichomes

1203
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:22,200
in order to build one of the hive

1204
00:48:20,239 --> 00:48:24,959
products that they use as an

1205
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:27,358
antimicrobial compound and it helps to

1206
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:29,679
structurally seal up gaps within the

1207
00:48:27,358 --> 00:48:32,880
hive it's called propolis you'll also

1208
00:48:29,679 --> 00:48:34,960
see this in a lot of body care products

1209
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:37,599
around because of those antimicrobial

1210
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:38,800
properties so that is possible

1211
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:40,880
however

1212
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:43,760
i would not expect that to happen unless

1213
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:46,160
there is nothing else for them to

1214
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:47,839
collect to turn into that propolis it

1215
00:48:46,159 --> 00:48:49,118
seems really unlikely that they would

1216
00:48:47,838 --> 00:48:51,599
use

1217
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:53,680
cannabis trichomes for that

1218
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:56,559
and then the other you know potentially

1219
00:48:53,679 --> 00:49:00,159
unlikely option is that

1220
00:48:56,559 --> 00:49:03,200
those inflorescences could have had a

1221
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:06,000
cannabis aphid outbreak

1222
00:49:03,199 --> 00:49:08,239
and honeybees are actually known

1223
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,400
to collect the secretions

1224
00:49:08,239 --> 00:49:12,318
of those aphids so actually it's you

1225
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:14,480
know really the species of the aphids

1226
00:49:12,318 --> 00:49:16,960
the honeydew because they

1227
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:20,000
the honeydew exactly so those aphids are

1228
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:21,440
sucking up tons and tons of those sugary

1229
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,000
plant juices

1230
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:26,480
filtering out most but certainly not all

1231
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,960
of the sugars and then excreting that

1232
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:32,000
and honeybees will go and collect that

1233
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:34,880
as a source of sugar so it is possible

1234
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,480
that that those inflorescences in that

1235
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:39,838
viral image

1236
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:42,240
had actually just a and a cannabis aphid

1237
00:49:39,838 --> 00:49:45,519
or some other aphid infestation and the

1238
00:49:42,239 --> 00:49:48,399
bees were there to collect that honeydew

1239
00:49:45,519 --> 00:49:52,000
but you know who knows this is all wild

1240
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:54,559
speculation um but one area

1241
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:57,679
that i think is kind of interesting is

1242
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:59,760
you know i i get a lot of questions from

1243
00:49:57,679 --> 00:50:02,879
the general public and again as well as

1244
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:05,920
from beekeepers about why the bees are

1245
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:08,160
going to collect this pollen in the

1246
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:10,480
first place what makes it so attractive

1247
00:50:08,159 --> 00:50:13,440
outside of just being present at this

1248
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:14,400
time when there's maybe not much else

1249
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:16,159
around

1250
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:18,318
um and

1251
00:50:16,159 --> 00:50:20,000
many people ask if the bees are getting

1252
00:50:18,318 --> 00:50:22,079
a buzz from

1253
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,199
visiting and collecting the pollen from

1254
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:26,240
these plants

1255
00:50:23,199 --> 00:50:28,960
and interestingly arthropods

1256
00:50:26,239 --> 00:50:31,679
as a group do not have

1257
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:34,800
those endocannabinoid receptors that we

1258
00:50:31,679 --> 00:50:37,358
have so they are not getting high at

1259
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:40,240
least in the same way that we would from

1260
00:50:37,358 --> 00:50:42,078
those cannabinoid molecules

1261
00:50:40,239 --> 00:50:44,318
not to say that they aren't potentially

1262
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:47,079
doing other things we know

1263
00:50:44,318 --> 00:50:49,039
you know cannabinoid molecules can have

1264
00:50:47,079 --> 00:50:51,920
antimicrobial action in and of

1265
00:50:49,039 --> 00:50:54,159
themselves and of course these plants

1266
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:56,318
are very protein rich as well and we

1267
00:50:54,159 --> 00:50:59,358
know that one of the

1268
00:50:56,318 --> 00:51:01,920
uses of terpenes by plants is to mediate

1269
00:50:59,358 --> 00:51:04,318
these interactions with insects and

1270
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:06,159
microbes which sometimes insects will

1271
00:51:04,318 --> 00:51:08,880
take advantage of in order to

1272
00:51:06,159 --> 00:51:10,960
self-medicate their own microbial issues

1273
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:14,079
that they have either internally or in

1274
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:16,480
their colony so there's a a lot of i

1275
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:19,519
think still unexplored questions about

1276
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:22,240
what the cannabinoids that are in that

1277
00:51:19,519 --> 00:51:24,639
pollen are doing internally with the

1278
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:28,239
bees when they consume it but they're

1279
00:51:24,639 --> 00:51:29,920
probably not getting a buzz

1280
00:51:28,239 --> 00:51:32,479
that's interesting but

1281
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:33,920
so you're saying we may learn of other

1282
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:35,280
reasons for that connection down the

1283
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,800
road that we're not even aware of at

1284
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:38,160
this point

1285
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:41,039
just because the research hasn't caught

1286
00:51:38,159 --> 00:51:42,159
up with it yet that's that's fascinating

1287
00:51:41,039 --> 00:51:43,440
um

1288
00:51:42,159 --> 00:51:46,639
one question

1289
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:50,240
that this kind of brought up for me is

1290
00:51:46,639 --> 00:51:52,799
thinking about bees and pesticides and

1291
00:51:50,239 --> 00:51:53,919
one of the reasons we would need to be

1292
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:56,079
more

1293
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:58,079
cautious with the sorts of things that

1294
00:51:56,079 --> 00:52:00,559
we're spraying onto

1295
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:02,400
hemp crops so as to protect you know

1296
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:03,359
native bee populations and things like

1297
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:05,440
that

1298
00:52:03,358 --> 00:52:06,400
does the sort of work that you're doing

1299
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:08,639
help

1300
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:10,079
regulators make better decisions down

1301
00:52:08,639 --> 00:52:12,078
the road as to what should be allowed

1302
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:14,559
and disallowed on

1303
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:16,880
you know these crops

1304
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:19,359
absolutely so

1305
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:22,318
fiber and grain hemp i mentioned before

1306
00:52:19,358 --> 00:52:25,199
the flowers on that crop are really not

1307
00:52:22,318 --> 00:52:26,480
very showy at all and so there is

1308
00:52:25,199 --> 00:52:28,480
already

1309
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:30,880
labels that are on many different

1310
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:33,599
pesticides that dictate when you can

1311
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:34,880
make applications the label of the law

1312
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:36,240
there so

1313
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:39,760
and of course many of them include

1314
00:52:36,239 --> 00:52:42,318
language about not spraying on to crops

1315
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:44,880
that have flowers or if your crop is in

1316
00:52:42,318 --> 00:52:47,358
flower that you need to do it outside of

1317
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:49,280
the time periods when bees are actively

1318
00:52:47,358 --> 00:52:51,358
foraging so either in the very early

1319
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:53,440
morning or in the evening

1320
00:52:51,358 --> 00:52:56,159
and so creating this awareness that

1321
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:58,159
there are these beneficial insects some

1322
00:52:56,159 --> 00:53:00,318
of which are experiencing population

1323
00:52:58,159 --> 00:53:02,159
declines and that we're concerned about

1324
00:53:00,318 --> 00:53:04,079
for this very reason of pesticide

1325
00:53:02,159 --> 00:53:06,399
exposure

1326
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:09,200
may be interacting with this crop in a

1327
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:10,318
way we had not expected is really

1328
00:53:09,199 --> 00:53:12,639
important

1329
00:53:10,318 --> 00:53:15,039
in terms of those who are on the high

1330
00:53:12,639 --> 00:53:17,598
cannabinoid side i've had a couple

1331
00:53:15,039 --> 00:53:18,960
questions from folks who are using

1332
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:20,559
feminizing

1333
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:22,240
compounds

1334
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:23,599
or

1335
00:53:22,239 --> 00:53:24,799
compounds that

1336
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:27,519
cause

1337
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:28,440
female plants to express

1338
00:53:27,519 --> 00:53:30,639
male

1339
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:33,838
inflorescences and whether those

1340
00:53:30,639 --> 00:53:36,078
compounds are likely to cause issues for

1341
00:53:33,838 --> 00:53:36,799
bees that may pick up that pollen i

1342
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:38,960
think

1343
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:41,519
most of the work that's done with those

1344
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:44,960
compounds that initiate male

1345
00:53:41,519 --> 00:53:48,000
inflorescences on female plants usually

1346
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:49,280
are done in greenhouse or in closed

1347
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,239
environments

1348
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:52,800
but

1349
00:53:50,239 --> 00:53:55,838
they can be very toxic to

1350
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:58,880
insects um although they're you know not

1351
00:53:55,838 --> 00:54:01,119
generally registered for use outdoors so

1352
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:03,119
we don't know much about the potential

1353
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:04,880
risk to pollinators but it's certainly

1354
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:06,400
something that i i would be concerned

1355
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:08,240
about

1356
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:10,160
this is why we have labels for

1357
00:54:08,239 --> 00:54:11,358
pesticides that are very very strict and

1358
00:54:10,159 --> 00:54:12,960
why it's so important you don't do

1359
00:54:11,358 --> 00:54:14,480
anything off label

1360
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,920
that's something that absolutely suzanne

1361
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:18,318
has just drilled into my head over the

1362
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:19,200
years as being so important

1363
00:54:18,318 --> 00:54:22,960
so

1364
00:54:19,199 --> 00:54:22,960
i hope folks take that to heart

1365
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:25,838
well

1366
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:27,599
you know we covered quite a bit today

1367
00:54:25,838 --> 00:54:29,440
was there anything else uh you wanted to

1368
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:31,680
mention while we while we were on the

1369
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:34,318
line here

1370
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:37,519
i think we have covered everything i

1371
00:54:34,318 --> 00:54:40,719
would certainly encourage anyone who has

1372
00:54:37,519 --> 00:54:43,039
questions or is excited about

1373
00:54:40,719 --> 00:54:46,879
