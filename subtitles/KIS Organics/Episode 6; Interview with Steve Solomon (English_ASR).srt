gardening west of the Cascades and the

14
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,320
intelligent Gardener can we start off

15
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:42,878
today talking about your own personal

16
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,759
journey and how you came to write the

17
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:46,558
intelligent Gardener which focuses on

18
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:49,320
soil remineralization and nutrient

19
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:51,479
density you know you're asking me to

20
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,558
tell you about my whole

21
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:57,198
life

22
00:00:53,558 --> 00:00:59,518
uh and uh there's uh not enough time to

23
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:02,159
do that so I'm going to uh condense

24
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:04,679
things as as best I can and if I wander

25
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:06,840
you stop me so I I wanted to live a life

26
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,680
where I worked as little as possible and

27
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,400
I conceived the idea that if I could

28
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:13,320
produce as much of my own stuff as I

29
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,080
could and I wouldn't have to earn money

30
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:18,079
or pay taxes on it and I might have a

31
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:19,920
much better lifestyle so we moved from

32
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:21,679
Los Angeles sold the business bought

33
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,280
five acres in Oregon that looked real

34
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,720
pretty to us I knew because I read all

35
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:30,239
the organic gardening literature I had

36
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:32,798
been subscribing organic gardening mag

37
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:35,199
and I've read their books and I knew

38
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:38,799
this was the truth uh that I could take

39
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:41,000
any Oak Clay Pit or gravel Heap and uh

40
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:43,000
uh turn it into a garden of eaten as

41
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,680
long as I put enough compost into the

42
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,078
ground and maybe some

43
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:51,960
lime so I found this beautiful green

44
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:54,559
Hillside in Oregon in the springtime and

45
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:56,679
uh uh I could afford it and was just 5

46
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,560
Acres of bare land with some little

47
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:01,320
Douglas gr trees self seating on it and

48
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:05,159
enough that was flat enough that I could

49
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:07,000
put in a garden and uh moved on to it

50
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:09,920
and I put in a big garden and started to

51
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,080
eat out of it and then one thing after

52
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:16,518
another happened and uh a few years

53
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:20,239
later I found myself in the seed

54
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:22,400
business uh not knowing how to do it uh

55
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:25,080
not knowing how to make any money at it

56
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,480
it took me uh two years of being in the

57
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,959
business before I learned to make a

58
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:31,759
little bit of a profit well I basically

59
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:34,519
taken every every bit of money I had

60
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:37,519
left which by the way was

61
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:39,920
$113,000 okay now you're referring to

62
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:42,200
territorial seed there that's right

63
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:45,158
territorial Seed Company yeah it got

64
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:47,518
capitalized with all the $113,000 that I

65
00:02:45,158 --> 00:02:50,079
still have yeah it's a highly

66
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,200
successible Seed Company yes yeah it

67
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,599
became that but in the first few years I

68
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:57,079
had no idea how to run a seed business

69
00:02:54,598 --> 00:02:59,039
and uh how to charge for the seed or you

70
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:02,719
know I had to learn but I tried to do it

71
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:04,400
honestly so so I put in a trials ground

72
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:06,759
uh if you find a seed company doesn't

73
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,879
have a trials ground go the other way uh

74
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:10,598
they're

75
00:03:07,878 --> 00:03:13,759
just um not somebody i' want to uh

76
00:03:10,598 --> 00:03:17,759
admire or do business with I won't use a

77
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:19,959
lot of other language so there I was uh

78
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:22,598
with a business that was not making me

79
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:25,319
any money truly the first year I made

80
00:03:22,598 --> 00:03:27,158
nothing uh took nothing out of it

81
00:03:25,318 --> 00:03:28,839
because everything everything I just

82
00:03:27,158 --> 00:03:31,318
needed everything to try to do the next

83
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:34,120
year the next year I actually managed to

84
00:03:31,318 --> 00:03:35,560
take $4,000 out of the business and

85
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,120
pretty much lived on that

86
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:40,400
$4,000 and the year after that I took

87
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:43,840
$7,000 out of the business and then it

88
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:47,360
got better then it went 14 28 you know

89
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:50,120
40 I started doing well but uh in the

90
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:53,000
beginning uh it was pretty difficult so

91
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:56,640
what kept me going was the trial ground

92
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,680
now I had a a lady friend at that time

93
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:01,798
uh who became Mrs Solomon her name was

94
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,120
Isabelle Moser and she ran the Great Oak

95
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:06,000
school of health and she was a

96
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,280
naturopath who practiced medicine

97
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,519
without a license and had always avoided

98
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:13,719
going to prison for for any of the uh

99
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,799
crimes that she was committing uh like

100
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:17,839
practicing medicine without a license or

101
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:19,358
having somebody with cancer who was

102
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:21,078
dying and sent home to die by the

103
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:23,279
doctors come and stay with her and try

104
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:25,079
to recover and they died anyway and then

105
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:27,359
you know there's manslaughter

106
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:28,800
charges uh and there's all that sort of

107
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,520
thing I don't know if you're aware of

108
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,520
how health Alternative Health is

109
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:35,680
suppressed in the United States but she

110
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:39,240
was a very brave Outlaw and Isabelle

111
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:41,519
told me that I would be a lot healthier

112
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,800
uh the more vegetables that I ate and

113
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:44,319
that the fact that I didn't have any

114
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,919
money and had all these trials was

115
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:47,319
really a great opportunity for me and

116
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:49,240
all I really need to do was learn how to

117
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:52,680
live on vegetables almost completely and

118
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:55,400
the more I did that the healthier I'd

119
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:57,639
become oh well that seems to make sense

120
00:04:55,399 --> 00:05:00,879
so I did that and the more I did that

121
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:04,120
the more unhealthful I became

122
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:07,000
and um Isabelle uh came and moved in

123
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:09,120
with me uh and she started eating the

124
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,839
same vegetables and the more she ate

125
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,519
them the less healthful she became

126
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:16,239
although she was extraordinarily healthy

127
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:21,120
woman uh she began to experience uh uh

128
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:23,280
brittle hair and uh uh thin fingernails

129
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,160
that sort of stuff and I started to have

130
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:28,318
uh teeth that got a bit wobbly sort of

131
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,199
had off days and felt grouchy and lost

132
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:33,120
energy and things started seemed

133
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:35,160
difficult and life seemed stressful so

134
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,199
after about four years in the business I

135
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,160
was making enough money and things were

136
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,960
organized well enough that we took off

137
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,960
six months and I just didn't do trials

138
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:45,879
that year and we went away at the

139
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:48,359
beginning at the end of the spring and

140
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:51,399
didn't come back until after Christmas

141
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:53,840
and uh went to Fiji and that's where I

142
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:55,439
had this uh illumination where we just

143
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:59,758
started eating the fruits and vegetables

144
00:05:55,439 --> 00:06:01,478
in the market uh in Fiji in sua and uh

145
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,560
we didn't go to the tourist Fiji we went

146
00:06:01,478 --> 00:06:05,680
to the capital city of Fiji and lived

147
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:07,720
with the Fijian people and did what you

148
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:12,000
do in subba it's not a place most

149
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:17,039
tourists went the market there had all

150
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:19,598
the usual um European vegetables uh as

151
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:22,000
well as a whole lot of tropical stuff

152
00:06:19,598 --> 00:06:24,319
and uh we ate all that stuff including

153
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,360
we found it all tasted really good uh we

154
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:29,039
started eating okra too and we ate

155
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:31,038
plenty of beans and and and they had

156
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:33,439
green we had cook greens of various

157
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:34,918
kinds we anyway we ate more or less the

158
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:37,000
same kind of diet we'd always been

159
00:06:34,918 --> 00:06:39,079
eating and my teeth got tight in my jaw

160
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,279
on her fingernails got hard and her F

161
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:44,359
hair got beautiful and we had much more

162
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:46,918
energy and we felt much better and uh I

163
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:48,560
wanted to find out what was going on so

164
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:49,879
I I made some inquiries and found out

165
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,879
that all those vegetables that we've

166
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:53,680
been eating came from the Singa Valley

167
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:56,159
which was an hour and 20 minutes drive

168
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,840
out of subba so we rented a car for the

169
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,680
day we never had a car there and we only

170
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:02,878
had one for the one day but we rented a

171
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:05,319
car for the day and drove up to the

172
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:06,840
Singa Valley and I rung ahead and booked

173
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:08,639
myself in to have a visit with the

174
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:11,279
research station that they had up there

175
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:13,960
in the valley and uh they showed me

176
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:16,279
around and told me how the farmers grew

177
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:18,478
vegetable crops and and that they never

178
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:21,719
used fertilizer and that they'd grown

179
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:23,800
vegetables for 75 years in that Valley

180
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:27,879
uh European type vegetables and they'

181
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:30,280
never used any fertilizer in 75 years

182
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:32,000
but they did use lots of pesticides

183
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:35,119
uh and I think he said the reason they

184
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,879
had to do that was that when you grow

185
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:40,120
European French beans snap beans you

186
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:41,720
call them in the United States uh in the

187
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:44,918
tropics so there's a lot of things that

188
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:47,319
want to eat them you know but they were

189
00:07:44,918 --> 00:07:50,839
grown without fertilizer the reason that

190
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:54,240
it worked is is that the The Watershed

191
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:57,799
of the Singa River has is an area of

192
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,639
extraordinarily highly mineralized Rock

193
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,478
uh of a type that's called Ultra basic

194
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:06,158
ous Rock and it basically means it's

195
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:09,639
just ch choco block with plant nutrients

196
00:08:06,158 --> 00:08:11,839
cat I with calcium and magnesium and

197
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:13,960
pottassium and iron and zinc and

198
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:16,399
manganese and

199
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:18,680
copper it's just loaded with all that

200
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:20,839
stuff it makes soils that tend to be

201
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:23,439
neutral to slightly alkaline which is

202
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:25,679
why they call it Ultra basic ous rock

203
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:28,319
well that stuff comes down the Singa Riv

204
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,360
River as silt and about every three

205
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,399
years there's a Cyclone or what they

206
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:35,479
call a cyclone there or would you call a

207
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:38,038
hurricane and uh the sing singota floods

208
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:39,839
and it covers the entire valley floor no

209
00:08:38,038 --> 00:08:41,759
one has a house on the valley floor

210
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:43,480
except the government research station

211
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:46,159
which is up on a sort of a

212
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:48,399
mound um everybody who Farms There lives

213
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:51,679
on the little bit on the slopes outside

214
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:53,879
the valley anyway it deposits a Sil and

215
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:57,000
every 3 years or so there's a large

216
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:59,039
deposit of freshly ground rock dust of

217
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,360
the most mineralized sort you could ever

218
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:03,319
want want to have and uh during the

219
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,278
Rainy it has a two- season climate

220
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:07,920
there's a dry mild season when the

221
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:10,439
weather is like beautiful mild spring

222
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:13,399
day a mild summer day in Washington you

223
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:16,240
know and it's it's 78 degrees and the

224
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:18,278
sun is shining and you know uh the only

225
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,200
difference is that in the dry season

226
00:09:18,278 --> 00:09:22,240
there the kns would never go down below

227
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,399
about I don't know

228
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,519
65 something like that they're always

229
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,399
mild and shirt sleeve weather then it

230
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:30,240
gets rainy and hot and humid and it gets

231
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,360
so humid and so hot that all those

232
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,399
vegetable crops die of disease and the

233
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:37,560
fields get taken over by weeds and the

234
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:39,639
weeds grow mid chest High uh for about

235
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:41,159
five months and then it stops raining

236
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:43,078
and they get in there and plow the weeds

237
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:45,319
under and they decompose rapidly and

238
00:09:43,078 --> 00:09:47,439
that's the organic matter and I think

239
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:49,600
the decomposition of the organic matter

240
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,959
also helps release minerals out of the

241
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,920
rock dust and uh they plant their

242
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:56,958
vegetable seeds and they grow beautiful

243
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:59,120
crops and it tastes really good and made

244
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:01,278
us incredibly healthy despite the p

245
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,919
pesticide residues and I had to figure

246
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:08,879
that out because I believed in organic

247
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:12,000
stuff I was a believer in all that rale

248
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:15,958
[ __ ] so so Steve let me pause you so

249
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,440
just to clarify the soil where all the

250
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:20,599
vegetables that you were eating at your

251
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:23,640
time in Fiji was grown in a particular

252
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:26,278
Valley where no fertilizer was being

253
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:30,000
used whatsoever but that's right a

254
00:10:26,278 --> 00:10:32,200
variety of chemical pesticides that uh

255
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,320
did not fit with your current organic

256
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:37,160
Dogma or ideals that's right and my

257
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,800
belief system at that time would have

258
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:40,319
told me that those pesticides were bad

259
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:42,078
for me and that there's no way I could

260
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,480
possibly be healthy if I'm eating food

261
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:46,399
with pesticide residues on and I came

262
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,600
away from there with a different opinion

263
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:51,240
which was after I thought it over and

264
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,720
you asked me about it a few years later

265
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,919
I think I would have told you and a lot

266
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,120
of

267
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:57,958
audiences that and I came up with a

268
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:00,278
wonderful line that I used to use when I

269
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:02,319
lectured I said the problem is not that

270
00:11:00,278 --> 00:11:05,759
there's residues of pesticides in our

271
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:08,000
food the problem is uh uh that there's

272
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:10,439
only residues of nutrition left their

273
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,480
our Foods so you're not claiming that

274
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:16,880
pesticides are necessarily good but

275
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:18,839
rather that the level of mineral content

276
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:21,200
in our vegetables is so

277
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:24,320
depleted because our soils are so

278
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:27,079
depleted that um it's affecting our n

279
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:29,399
Nutri our nutrient levels and our health

280
00:11:27,078 --> 00:11:31,638
way more than these Trace Trace elements

281
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:34,240
of of pesticides that may be left on the

282
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:35,720
vegetable itself yeah well the trace

283
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,560
elements wouldn't hurt us but the

284
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:40,399
pesticides the residues of the

285
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:43,199
pesticides yes they are an insult to our

286
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:45,278
body they are poisons okay and our

287
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,040
bodies are designed to deal with insults

288
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:50,120
and poisons uh and uh the better

289
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:52,078
nourished the body is and the healthier

290
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,959
the body is the better it is at handling

291
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:56,519
that sort of stuff so a very

292
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:59,399
well-nourished body would be much less

293
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:01,839
affected by pesticide residues generally

294
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:04,200
speaking on an average and we're talking

295
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:07,839
statistics here not about any individual

296
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:10,560
case sure so just to bring it back to uh

297
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:14,160
your time in Fiji so you you discovered

298
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:16,239
this knowledge and then uh winter winter

299
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:19,600
came and you had to head back to Oregon

300
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:23,120
at that point that's right and how did

301
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,920
that guide your gardening or your uh

302
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,198
your experiences moving forward after

303
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:30,919
you left Fiji well it didn't really nail

304
00:12:28,198 --> 00:12:33,159
home for about a year because we came

305
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:36,399
back from Fiji and we felt really good

306
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:38,159
we were enjoying life I mean uh we were

307
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,120
we were youngsters we were your age or

308
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:44,639
not much older you know we still didn't

309
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:46,720
have much sense and uh so we just went

310
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,759
back into it and Isabelle was an athlete

311
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,120
she did triathlons and got in endurance

312
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:53,838
a Athletics and I got back into my

313
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:56,440
business and writing and after about a

314
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:58,199
year we noticed that her fingernails

315
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:00,480
were getting soft again and her hair was

316
00:12:58,198 --> 00:13:02,958
deteriorating and my energy level was

317
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:05,839
dropping and my positive attitude was

318
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:08,159
harder to maintain some days uh and my

319
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:12,240
teeth were starting to worsen

320
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:14,958
again and I said [ __ ] you know it's the

321
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,680
food we're eating it's it's that trials

322
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:19,679
ground that we're eating off of what's

323
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:23,559
wrong with it you see I didn't really

324
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:25,439
know I had been using uh sort of like a

325
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:28,399
primitive approach to complete organic

326
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:33,000
fertilizer at that time uh I had already

327
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:36,440
evolved that uh and there was a a ratio

328
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,799
of limes I always I I wanted to have a

329
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:40,639
ratio of calcium to magnesium that was 7

330
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:42,599
to1 so I tried to put in a mixture of

331
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,959
dolomite and agim to come up with about

332
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,879
7 to1 because I didn't know anything

333
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:49,239
about soil testing I figured well the

334
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:53,198
best thing I can do is put it in at 7

335
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:55,959
to1 sure and not put it in too fast uh

336
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:59,120
you know and I I I did I got a lot of

337
00:13:55,958 --> 00:14:00,479
information I started doing research and

338
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,399
I mean if you want I can tell you about

339
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,639
all the mistakes I made along the way

340
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:07,958
but well what what I would like to maybe

341
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:09,799
focus in on then is so you started

342
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:12,119
researching this and I know from reading

343
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:14,719
your book more than one time actually

344
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:17,959
that uh you focused on some of the work

345
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,560
by Price yeah and the the dental records

346
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:21,518
which I think is really fascinating and

347
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:23,638
then you also started looking into

348
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,919
remineralization with um some of the

349
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:28,079
work by William albrech maybe if you

350
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:30,879
could touch on both of those findings

351
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:33,198
briefly that would be wonderful yeah and

352
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:35,679
just let me just sort of put a warning

353
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:37,159
out there that um I write this book

354
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:39,159
called growing vegetables was the

355
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:41,480
Cascades and it's been through seven

356
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:44,639
editions and every one of those editions

357
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:46,480
except one has been a complete rewrite

358
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,480
it's a totally different book every

359
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:52,600
single time it comes out with the same

360
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:55,519
title okay and so uh some of the earlier

361
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:57,720
editions have versions of complete

362
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,240
organic fertilizer or make assertions

363
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,120
about the nature of the soils or what

364
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:04,320
you should do that today I would

365
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:07,000
consider incorrect so I I contradict

366
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09,278
myself from book to book yeah so I I

367
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,480
just don't want people to uh uh get

368
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:13,439
stuck uh if they've got an older book or

369
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:15,879
believe something that I said back in

370
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:19,279
198 888 or

371
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:21,039
1992 uh I mean that was only from a very

372
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:23,439
limited partial understanding of the

373
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:26,278
whole thing it took a long time before I

374
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,720
got it all worked out sure I would I

375
00:15:26,278 --> 00:15:29,600
would say that's one of the things that

376
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,560
I really appreciate about you as an

377
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,360
author is that you are open-minded to

378
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:36,278
learning new things and changing your

379
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,600
mind on subjects as you become uh more

380
00:15:36,278 --> 00:15:42,039
experienced or more educated on a

381
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:43,720
particular subject thank you um I think

382
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:46,719
that's one of my strong points too or

383
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:49,800
weak points anyway the older I get the

384
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:52,480
more I realize I'm not so damn smart you

385
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:55,000
know so can you tell our listeners a

386
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:58,680
little bit about what you learned from

387
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:01,360
uh price in particular Western price

388
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:04,679
gosh his book nutrition and physical

389
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:06,039
degeneration is in my opinion the most

390
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:09,239
important book that was written in the

391
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:11,480
20th century and I'm I mean you can even

392
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:13,879
put Einstein in their top 10 or all

393
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:17,278
those any other book you come up with

394
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:20,318
because see price did something for us

395
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:24,318
that's absolutely Priceless he

396
00:16:20,318 --> 00:16:27,759
documented the existence of groups of

397
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:31,198
people that no longer are the way he

398
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:34,079
documented them in the

399
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:36,758
1930s there still were places on this

400
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:39,399
planet that were so isolated that the

401
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:42,720
people who lived there completely ate

402
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:46,240
the food that they got there and they

403
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:48,839
didn't bring in any food they were poor

404
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:51,680
usually and very simple they lived in

405
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:53,199
hard to get at places that nobody wanted

406
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:55,599
uh you know little remote Valley

407
00:16:53,198 --> 00:16:58,078
somewhere someplace we had to trekk in

408
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,278
Pakistan through passes that were frozen

409
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:02,439
and ice snow 9 out of 12 months of the

410
00:17:00,278 --> 00:17:04,038
year you know and go up so thin you

411
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,798
could hardly walk with the danger of

412
00:17:04,038 --> 00:17:07,599
slipping off the edge and dying every

413
00:17:05,798 --> 00:17:09,519
300 meters you know on a really

414
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:12,519
dangerous Trail for a couple three days

415
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:15,318
of this to get there places like that so

416
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:17,359
price had heard about these places and

417
00:17:15,318 --> 00:17:18,519
he was interested in Dental Health from

418
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:20,519
the point of view of preventative

419
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:23,759
Dentistry he spent his whole life trying

420
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:27,078
to work in there he had failed

421
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:29,440
completely as as a research scientist he

422
00:17:27,078 --> 00:17:31,879
never could figure out how to prevent

423
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,558
people from having bad teeth he'd see

424
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:35,679
occasional people who had bad really

425
00:17:33,558 --> 00:17:37,558
good teeth but why is it just their

426
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:40,720
genes is it where they grew up is it was

427
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:42,200
it their diet there was no way to know

428
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,558
and he said the only way we're ever

429
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,640
going to sort this is if we have a

430
00:17:43,558 --> 00:17:48,359
control group and we don't have a

431
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:50,000
control group but maybe these people are

432
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:52,038
a control group he says I hear that

433
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,200
these people in these remote places have

434
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:56,679
extraordinary good health and almost

435
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:59,919
perfect teeth all of them let's go and

436
00:17:56,679 --> 00:18:02,880
have a look so he and his wife organized

437
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:05,640
these uh basically TRS into remote

438
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,320
places with the assistance of the local

439
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,799
medical authorities usually because

440
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:12,158
price was quite well known globally uh

441
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:14,798
as a medical you know Dental researcher

442
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:17,360
so he went and visited these people and

443
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:20,400
he did this over three years uh very

444
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:22,399
extended uh trips by ship of course to

445
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,480
different continents and then Journeys

446
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,960
to these places and he went with I don't

447
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,400
know how many people he went with I'd

448
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,640
really do I'd love to know the det

449
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,038
details of who how how how he organize

450
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,120
these things but he took a lot of

451
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:37,240
photographs very high quality black and

452
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:39,798
white pictures he had a lab with him

453
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:43,000
where he he didn't analyze the soils

454
00:18:39,798 --> 00:18:45,200
they had only primitive knowledge of

455
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,640
nutritional aspects of food but what

456
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:50,519
albre did know how to find out oh excuse

457
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:53,880
me what price knew how to find out was

458
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:55,720
the mineral content of the food vitamins

459
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,799
were just being discovered they weren't

460
00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:00,558
sure what they were exactly you know

461
00:18:57,798 --> 00:19:02,200
their chemical formulation was not known

462
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:03,839
all the B vitamins were just sort of

463
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,240
lumped together and I think they were

464
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:06,639
called B vitamins because they were

465
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,759
water

466
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:12,200
soluble um but they didn't know one from

467
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:14,038
the next but price was able to Ash the

468
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:16,038
food he could take a sample of food and

469
00:19:14,038 --> 00:19:17,798
he could heat it up until he burned off

470
00:19:16,038 --> 00:19:19,919
all the carbon and all he had was some

471
00:19:17,798 --> 00:19:22,400
Ash and then he could use Simple

472
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,400
analytical chemistry and say in that Ash

473
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,240
there was so much potassium so much

474
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,880
phosphorus so much calcium so much

475
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:31,640
magnesium

476
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:34,480
and that's what he did so he collected

477
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:37,720
that data from several dozen groups of

478
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,200
people and took photographs of often

479
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:41,839
quite old people with all the teeth in

480
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:44,679
their jaw and obviously in good health

481
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:48,359
and documented all kinds of anecdotal

482
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:50,320
evidence and looked at questions like

483
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:52,319
are the people in this remote place so

484
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:53,918
healthy because they have special genes

485
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:55,720
and not like the people down in the

486
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,120
valley who don't have those genes and

487
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:59,159
that's why they have good teeth and the

488
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:01,399
people in the valley have rotten keeth

489
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:03,799
no that's not what happened actually he

490
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:05,759
got documentation of young people from

491
00:20:03,798 --> 00:20:07,200
the remote place with perfect key so

492
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:08,720
went down to the town to have an

493
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,798
adventure and stayed there for three

494
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:14,480
years ate the food down there and came

495
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:16,798
back home with a mouth full of

496
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,960
Decay and then he'd find in many of

497
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:21,599
those people that the carries the dental

498
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:25,400
cavities actually had healed and uh had

499
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:27,918
scarred over with naturally occurring

500
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:30,880
enamel but it was obviously scar tissue

501
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:33,759
and the body had healed those cavities

502
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,320
isn't that amazing all up uh those

503
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:39,240
people were

504
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:41,240
intaking two three four times the

505
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:42,519
mineral nutrition of the average

506
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:46,000
American in the

507
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:48,158
1930s so basically the the quality of

508
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,079
the food that they were growing from a

509
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:52,159
mineral perspective was much higher and

510
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:53,839
therefore their own health which was

511
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:57,080
reflected in their dental records and

512
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:58,678
their Dental Health was much higher as

513
00:20:57,079 --> 00:21:00,319
well so they didn't have a lot of the

514
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:03,200
tooth decay and problems that you were

515
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:05,359
seeing right in other areas of the world

516
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,840
at that time another way to say that

517
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:10,038
would be that the designer of the human

518
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:11,720
body designed it so that if it was

519
00:21:10,038 --> 00:21:13,879
adequately nourished it would keep all

520
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:15,759
of its teeth for its entire lifetime and

521
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:17,559
they would be in perfect condition and

522
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:18,879
they would be tighten the jaw and the

523
00:21:17,558 --> 00:21:21,319
only thing that would affect them would

524
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,480
be uh eating a whole lot of abrasive

525
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:25,599
stuff that wore them down in which case

526
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:27,480
they also had the ability to replace the

527
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:29,240
hard coating on the outside if you're

528
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:32,200
well alert nourished enough which is how

529
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:33,919
those cavities heal or else you played

530
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,159
Sports you know and you got a few teeth

531
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:37,880
knocked

532
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:40,760
out but other than that that's the

533
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:44,760
body's design you see it's it's how it's

534
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:50,359
made the body is made to last uh I don't

535
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:52,440
know 110 years okay let's say on average

536
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:55,759
which means that if we all had perfect

537
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:57,600
nutrition for a few Generations because

538
00:21:55,759 --> 00:21:59,558
just one generation all of a sudden

539
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:02,079
starting on perfect nutrition does not

540
00:21:59,558 --> 00:22:04,599
make perfect babies the actually the

541
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:06,558
nutrient density of mothers has to

542
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:09,719
increase and it takes several

543
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:12,839
generations for a line of females to

544
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:15,079
develop sufficient nutritional reserves

545
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:17,038
that they can then form a perfect fetus

546
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:19,879
and then nourish it with you know with

547
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:23,679
breast mil that fetus would then go on

548
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:26,320
to have an average LIF span of 110 years

549
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:29,600
probably Steve just to uh bring this

550
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:32,158
back to plants obviously

551
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:34,719
remineralizing soils is important from a

552
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:37,159
nutrition perspective in terms of our

553
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,120
own human health what are you finding

554
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:41,120
though in terms of the health of your

555
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:44,000
and growth of your plants by adding

556
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:46,239
these minerals back into your soil I

557
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
started intentionally remineralizing a

558
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,519
year before the intelligent Gardener

559
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
came out so that was I mean kind of like

560
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:53,278
where I was dealing with Trace elements

561
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,240
and really with the kind of

562
00:22:53,278 --> 00:22:58,759
remineralization that I'm advocating

563
00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:01,720
these days so ever since then my food

564
00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:04,480
has tasted better every single year year

565
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:07,120
on year and it's still happening not all

566
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:09,679
of it but some of the crops uh sometimes

567
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:12,319
of vegetables the flavor improved a

568
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,880
great deal uh for the first few years

569
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:16,200
and then it sort of

570
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:18,360
stabilized uh and it's very nice that'

571
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:20,759
be stuff that's shallow rooted crops

572
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:24,000
like lettuce cuz I got the top soil

573
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:26,278
remineralized first you see but the

574
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,519
trouble is how do you remineralize the

575
00:23:26,278 --> 00:23:32,038
next 6 in down the nextx foot down

576
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:34,960
because vegetables will put Roots down a

577
00:23:32,038 --> 00:23:38,079
lot further than most people realize if

578
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,880
they can and if they don't encounter a

579
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:42,960
lot of nutrition down there they don't

580
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:46,120
do as well this is especially true of of

581
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:49,480
root crops like carrots and parsnips and

582
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:51,678
beetroot these crops and all the chores

583
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:53,319
they all feed in the subsoil chies you

584
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:54,880
know are a root crop that just makes

585
00:23:53,319 --> 00:23:57,000
edible leaves in the same way that

586
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,720
parsley is a root crop that makes edible

587
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,960
leaves the chicken chory let me tell you

588
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:03,919
what happened with my

589
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:07,440
chory we like to eat Indi but it has a

590
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:09,360
problem it tends to be bitter and it has

591
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,519
another problem in the winter time in

592
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:14,038
the humid weather and the cool humidity

593
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:16,879
of our autumn and winter uh it develops

594
00:24:14,038 --> 00:24:19,240
a leaf disease that tends to cause rot

595
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:22,080
spots and and it can get worse and worse

596
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:23,359
until it rots back to a stump and get so

597
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:25,960
spotted with these things you don't want

598
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:28,079
to eat it anymore and it'll kill it

599
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:30,120
eventually in a wet winter doesn't

600
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:32,000
happen anymore I thought that was the

601
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:33,959
nature of endog you know and it was hard

602
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,398
to grow in the humidity of the winter

603
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,840
and you put the plants further apart and

604
00:24:36,398 --> 00:24:39,759
you do everything possible to increase

605
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:41,720
air circulation and it doesn't rot as

606
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:43,319
quickly but it in a wet winter you're

607
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:45,319
just going to lose it I thought that was

608
00:24:43,319 --> 00:24:47,319
a nature of Endive now it doesn't happen

609
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:49,599
anymore now it just laughs at that

610
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:51,519
disease doesn't happen anymore because

611
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:53,158
when the Endive starts to try to feed

612
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:55,798
down two feet down it's finding

613
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:58,520
nourishment now it just took years to

614
00:24:55,798 --> 00:25:00,639
leech it down there so you're seeing an

615
00:24:58,519 --> 00:25:03,319
increase in disease resistance

616
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,120
essentially huge at the same time

617
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:05,960
there's another problem with mve right

618
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:08,278
it's

619
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:10,159
bitter well at the same time that the

620
00:25:08,278 --> 00:25:11,839
endives stopped having problems with the

621
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:13,480
spots on the leaves it stopped being

622
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:15,398
nearly as bitter and started actually

623
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:18,759
being so sweet we can eat it like

624
00:25:15,398 --> 00:25:22,079
lettuce so improving the quality of the

625
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:24,679
flavors and odors of your given crop

626
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:27,158
essentially a great deal people who eat

627
00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:29,759
with us are just Gob smacked at how good

628
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:31,760
our food taste they don't have a clue

629
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:34,319
how good vegetables can taste until they

630
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:36,240
taste my vegetables or how satisfying

631
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:37,759
they can be and how much less inclined

632
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,679
we are to eat other things than

633
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:44,158
vegetables because the vegetables are

634
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:46,840
just so so rich I don't know how to put

635
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:48,640
it sure everyone has had the experience

636
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:51,480
of eating conventionally grown or

637
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:53,640
hydroponic tomato from a grocery store

638
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:55,880
or going out to a real farm and picking

639
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:58,360
one off a Vine and and the difference in

640
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:00,520
the in the flavor is

641
00:25:58,359 --> 00:26:04,079
dramatic right now if you could go to

642
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:06,398
that farm and walk the rows of a variety

643
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:10,158
trial and taste 30 different kinds of

644
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:13,000
tomato all at the same time okay you'd

645
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:14,520
find there was a lot of difference and

646
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,319
some of them had a lot better flavor

647
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:21,359
than others but if you could take and

648
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:23,038
put a couple of parallel rows with the

649
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:25,359
same varieties and you fully

650
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:27,720
remineralized one row and you didn't

651
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:29,519
with the other the plants might not look

652
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:31,440
call that different but you would sure

653
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:33,440
notice the taste difference in the same

654
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,440
variety from the two different soil

655
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:39,159
circumstances another thing that happens

656
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:41,320
with remineralized food it doesn't mold

657
00:26:39,159 --> 00:26:43,480
after you harvest it you know if you

658
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:45,720
just let it sit out on the counter uh it

659
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:48,679
doesn't grow mold it just sort of slowly

660
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:50,880
loses moisture and shrinks a little bit

661
00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:53,640
it stops being quite as crisp it just

662
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:56,360
sits there you know it it stores a whole

663
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:58,000
lot better if you put it in the fridge

664
00:26:56,359 --> 00:27:00,119
okay so can you can you touch a little

665
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
bit on how grower or a gardener would

666
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:04,519
use some of these principles in terms of

667
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,000
adding these these minerals back into

668
00:27:04,519 --> 00:27:08,918
their soil so I know that in your book

669
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,720
you talk a lot about soil testing can

670
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:13,360
you describe that process to someone

671
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:16,120
that would be new to this subject yeah

672
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:18,359
but I want to back up one step and I

673
00:27:16,119 --> 00:27:21,119
want to talk about targets what are we

674
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:23,839
trying to accomplish the soil test is

675
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:26,719
just the tool that we use to accomplish

676
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:28,199
it with but uh I think we want to start

677
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:32,319
talk about what it is you're trying to

678
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:35,440
do albre worked out the basics of this

679
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:38,158
stuff he worked out roughly the

680
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:40,960
relationship the levels of calcium and

681
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:43,919
magnesium and pottassium and phosphorus

682
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:46,880
that a plant needed to produce a lot of

683
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:48,559
protein and to be very healthy such that

684
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:51,200
the livestock had ate it would also be

685
00:27:48,558 --> 00:27:54,079
very healthy but he didn't finish the

686
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:56,080
work he probably didn't because the soil

687
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:58,720
testing procedures available at that

688
00:27:56,079 --> 00:28:01,038
time uh weren't sophisticated enough to

689
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,839
do soil testing inexpensively it would

690
00:28:01,038 --> 00:28:04,960
have been a it would have cost a great

691
00:28:02,839 --> 00:28:06,879
deal to determine how much copper and

692
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,440
zinc and manganese and stuff there was

693
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,760
in the soil or

694
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:13,080
Boron you know in those days it could

695
00:28:10,759 --> 00:28:17,200
have been done I think but it uh now

696
00:28:13,079 --> 00:28:20,079
it's easy now for $14

697
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:23,880
us and a little bit of postage to send

698
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:26,918
60 gram of soil to a lab in Ohio uh I

699
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:29,960
can get an accurate reading uh of the

700
00:28:26,919 --> 00:28:31,799
levels of all those elements in the soil

701
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:33,759
now are you referring to Logan Labs with

702
00:28:31,798 --> 00:28:36,158
that no actually I'm not I'm talking

703
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:38,679
about one called Spectrum analytic okay

704
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:41,799
loog Logan is $25 for their standard

705
00:28:38,679 --> 00:28:43,759
soil test I believe Logan's um

706
00:28:41,798 --> 00:28:46,359
presentation the way they give you the

707
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:48,679
information is probably a little more

708
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:50,959
friendly to an amateur otherwise there's

709
00:28:48,679 --> 00:28:53,519
not a lot of difference I mean they come

710
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:55,880
up with roughly the same kinds of

711
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:57,679
numbers they may differ but if they

712
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:59,519
differ it's all because all the numbers

713
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:01,600
from one will be 10% higher than all the

714
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:03,599
numbers from the other and in

715
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:05,359
practicality it doesn't really matter

716
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:07,599
what really matters is the relationship

717
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:10,439
between all those numbers and they'll be

718
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:12,759
the same from both Laboratories it took

719
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:17,159
the work of a whole lot of really smart

720
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:19,879
Farm advisors who sort of took alre as a

721
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:24,000
springboard and uh they developed a

722
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:27,840
philosophy of fertilizing soil called

723
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:30,480
base cat IR balancing the idea is is to

724
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:33,199
bring the levels of the plant nutrients

725
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:35,759
up to a point and a balance that

726
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:38,278
produces Optimum Health in those that

727
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:39,960
eat the food and at the same time

728
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:41,599
produces a very big yield and very

729
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:43,240
healthy plants that don't have as much

730
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:46,319
trouble with insects and diseases and

731
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:48,558
all that stuff which is all very good

732
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:51,599
and also you don't get that kind of

733
00:29:48,558 --> 00:29:53,319
result unless the land is healthy so

734
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:56,398
part of the process is maintaining

735
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:58,759
enough organic matter in the soil okay

736
00:29:56,398 --> 00:30:00,359
so it's a sort of generative or positive

737
00:29:58,759 --> 00:30:03,278
sort of Agriculture where you're

738
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:06,038
building real soil fertility uh and

739
00:30:03,278 --> 00:30:07,919
better health of the entire ecosystem to

740
00:30:06,038 --> 00:30:10,839
produce a result in the crops that you

741
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:12,960
want the trouble with that approach is

742
00:30:10,839 --> 00:30:14,918
it it does not appeal to a greedy

743
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,640
selfish farmer who just wants to make

744
00:30:14,919 --> 00:30:20,519
the biggest bottom line they can because

745
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:23,519
the economic logic of the farmer is is

746
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:25,798
their profit is result of how much they

747
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:28,240
can shortcut the inputs the more they

748
00:30:25,798 --> 00:30:30,158
can reduce the cost of input

749
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:33,200
the more money they can make so these

750
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:35,960
soil tests traditionally are focused

751
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,798
around minimums for yield isn't that

752
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,519
correct to where they're not talking

753
00:30:37,798 --> 00:30:41,480
about necessarily looking at their

754
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:43,960
recommendations are not necessarily for

755
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:46,558
optimal plant growth or health or soil

756
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:49,519
building but rather minimums to allow

757
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:51,038
for no plant deficiencies yeah the the

758
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:53,359
the word is

759
00:30:51,038 --> 00:30:56,038
sufficiency okay there's two

760
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:58,278
philosophies here about how to fertilize

761
00:30:56,038 --> 00:31:01,519
there's the economically rational

762
00:30:58,278 --> 00:31:04,798
philosophy and then there's the uh

763
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:06,638
ethical philosophy you might say so the

764
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:09,038
economic rationalists they just want to

765
00:31:06,638 --> 00:31:11,558
make sure that there's enough of all the

766
00:31:09,038 --> 00:31:15,158
plant nutrients that the crop will

767
00:31:11,558 --> 00:31:17,960
produce a lot and enough is defined this

768
00:31:15,159 --> 00:31:20,320
way putting any more in will not result

769
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:22,440
in any increase in yield that is anyway

770
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:24,359
relates to the cost of putting more in

771
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:26,399
so other words we put it in until the

772
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:28,918
yield Peaks out and then you don't put

773
00:31:26,398 --> 00:31:30,278
it anymore because it's not economically

774
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:33,759
rational you're better off to use your

775
00:31:30,278 --> 00:31:36,480
money for something else so they target

776
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:38,000
lower levels than somebody who is being

777
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,599
ethical about their food would want to

778
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,319
Target they want to make sure there's

779
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:43,278
enough copper there that the plant isn't

780
00:31:41,319 --> 00:31:46,798
obviously copper deficient in having any

781
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:48,679
gross copper deficiency symptoms but the

782
00:31:46,798 --> 00:31:50,599
idea that having 10 times that amount of

783
00:31:48,679 --> 00:31:54,320
copper in the soil might do something to

784
00:31:50,599 --> 00:31:57,439
the total balance of nutrition in the

785
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:59,720
crop more protective substances more

786
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,919
phytonutrients more of the stuff that

787
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:03,720
the plant uses to protect itself against

788
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:05,679
insect and diseases that then when the

789
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:08,159
human eats the plant helps us protects

790
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:10,600
us against diseases and things you see

791
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:12,720
they don't think about that stuff sure

792
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:15,319
now most of our listeners are uh

793
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:17,839
cannabis Growers now you have a high

794
00:32:15,319 --> 00:32:19,960
value crop here to where you can put

795
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:23,398
more into your soil and you can build

796
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:25,558
your soil so uh how does that influence

797
00:32:23,398 --> 00:32:27,638
uh your say your recommendations or how

798
00:32:25,558 --> 00:32:29,440
you would treat the soil knowing that

799
00:32:27,638 --> 00:32:30,839
you can afford to put throw throw a

800
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,840
little bit more at the crop in terms of

801
00:32:30,839 --> 00:32:34,839
minerals and nutrients well listen

802
00:32:32,839 --> 00:32:37,158
you're just very lucky in this respect

803
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:38,879
that you asked me this question because

804
00:32:37,159 --> 00:32:40,600
now there's no way that I could talk

805
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:44,480
about me growing cannabis here in

806
00:32:40,599 --> 00:32:46,959
Tasmania because it isn't legal sure but

807
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:49,960
it just so happens that I have a friend

808
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:52,759
who has a license to grow

809
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:55,200
hemp and we are growing hemp here in

810
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:57,359
Tasmania now and it's a burgeoning

811
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,600
industry uh that the government is

812
00:32:57,359 --> 00:33:01,959
actually trying to forward um they have

813
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:03,798
a certain problem with it in the um they

814
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:05,360
also want to have total control over it

815
00:33:03,798 --> 00:33:08,119
and want to make sure that nobody does

816
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:09,719
an extraction from hemp and gets CBD oil

817
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:12,879
out of it without them calling it

818
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:16,720
medicine and having it in their

819
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:18,799
system but in any case he asked me uh if

820
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,759
I would do some soil testing for him and

821
00:33:18,798 --> 00:33:23,480
make recommendations about what to do to

822
00:33:20,759 --> 00:33:26,240
grow a good hemp crop and I've done that

823
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:27,839
so I got some idea the kind of nutrition

824
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,000
hemp would need if you were thinking

825
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:31,199
about it from the point of view of

826
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,798
farming it you know raising it by the

827
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:36,558
acre and planting it like wheat so hemp

828
00:33:33,798 --> 00:33:39,519
needs hemp first of all it makes a lot

829
00:33:36,558 --> 00:33:42,200
of fiber plants that growing

830
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:43,919
vegetatively like him they probably need

831
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:45,319
twice as much potassium as most

832
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:47,720
vegetable

833
00:33:45,319 --> 00:33:49,759
crubs and they take a lot of it out of

834
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:52,120
the soil if somebody were to be growing

835
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:54,038
it in the same place they would have to

836
00:33:52,119 --> 00:33:57,599
and we're actually taking the the

837
00:33:54,038 --> 00:33:59,079
material out of the field then they

838
00:33:57,599 --> 00:34:00,599
realize they're taking a lot of

839
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:03,918
potassium when they when they take it

840
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:06,719
out of the ground hemp uses a lot of

841
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:08,878
manganese for some reason it just draws

842
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:11,280
a lot of Manganese it helps the plant be

843
00:34:08,878 --> 00:34:12,639
more healthy it uses a great deal of it

844
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,240
that brings up an interesting question

845
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:17,559
for me Steve y well it's sort of a two

846
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:19,918
point two-part question so my first

847
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:23,878
question is traditionally uh people on

848
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:26,199
these tests aim for p to equal K uh

849
00:34:23,878 --> 00:34:28,719
phosphorus and and potassium be equal

850
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:30,878
now uh you're suggesting with cannabis

851
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:33,638
sort of fits what some of the findings

852
00:34:30,878 --> 00:34:36,118
that I'm having as well saying that we

853
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:38,599
want to run potassium possibly a lot

854
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:40,440
higher than we would with phosphorus

855
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:42,519
that's right do you have any other

856
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:45,280
comments on that yeah I would think

857
00:34:42,519 --> 00:34:47,960
that's right there's one thing about my

858
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:50,599
experience that may be different with

859
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:52,440
the can with scrollers all right and

860
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:56,919
that is I'm talking about growing stuff

861
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:58,960
in the soil in the field where uh you're

862
00:34:56,918 --> 00:35:01,719
about several feet of growing media

863
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:04,079
beneath your feet uh a lot more root

864
00:35:01,719 --> 00:35:05,959
Zone than you can put into a small pot

865
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:09,400
if you start putting plants in synthetic

866
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:11,760
growing medium in in indoors now you're

867
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:14,760
dealing with a medium that doesn't have

868
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:17,079
any exchange capacity

869
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:18,920
usually and this is an interesting

870
00:35:17,079 --> 00:35:21,000
conversation if you're growing in

871
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:23,200
something that has no buffering capacity

872
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,079
do you use that term buffering

873
00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:26,960
capacity a little bit this may be

874
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:29,039
getting a little technical for some some

875
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,199
of the listeners but yes so the the

876
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:34,559
soils that we we manufacture here at

877
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:37,199
kiss Organics they range in Cc or cadine

878
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:38,719
exchange capacity I I'd have to look at

879
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:40,399
a test I don't have one in front of me

880
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:43,159
but I think they're around anywhere

881
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:45,358
between 20 to 30 that's quite high in

882
00:35:43,159 --> 00:35:47,879
fact I would like it very much if you

883
00:35:45,358 --> 00:35:49,960
off off later if you'd share with me

884
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:51,920
maybe on another day even what it is you

885
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:54,519
use uh to get that kind of exchange

886
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:56,358
capacity in a synthetic medium I would

887
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:59,719
imagine youd use vermiculite and

888
00:35:56,358 --> 00:36:02,279
charcoal and really good compost but I

889
00:35:59,719 --> 00:36:05,279
can't think of anything else anyway if

890
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:07,519
you can load up your exchange capacity

891
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:10,079
uh in your growing medium with the plant

892
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:12,039
nutrients that it needs then I'd say

893
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:13,720
you'd want it to test kind of the same

894
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:15,719
way as soil that you'd want to grow

895
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:18,159
tomato plant in with the exception that

896
00:36:15,719 --> 00:36:20,199
you'd want potassium up a bit higher and

897
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:23,039
then with another exception too if

898
00:36:20,199 --> 00:36:25,318
you're not feeding the crop mostly with

899
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:27,199
soluble fertilizers you see if you if

900
00:36:25,318 --> 00:36:29,440
you got a growing medium in a container

901
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:30,919
that has no buffering capacity and

902
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:33,079
basically you're you're growing in

903
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:35,200
Hydroponics yeah even if it looks like

904
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:37,920
soil even if you've got living compost

905
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:40,239
in it even if there's you know an e an

906
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,800
ecology living in it if most of the

907
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:43,479
nutrition the plants are getting is

908
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:45,359
coming in the water that you're you're

909
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:48,599
feeding the pot with then it's

910
00:36:45,358 --> 00:36:52,078
Hydroponics I'm not totally sure what

911
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:54,200
the proper levels would be to try to

912
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:56,440
duplicate that with dry fertilizers and

913
00:36:54,199 --> 00:36:58,199
the kind of stuff we use out in the soil

914
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:59,880
see see out in the field we have another

915
00:36:58,199 --> 00:37:02,239
thing or in a pot maybe that if you have

916
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:05,000
a large container with a growing medium

917
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:07,000
that has an exchange capacity over 20

918
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,480
then you could mix the nutrients into

919
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:12,358
the medium and they would then go onto

920
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:14,519
the exchange sites and sit there waiting

921
00:37:12,358 --> 00:37:16,199
for the plant to draw them off that

922
00:37:14,519 --> 00:37:18,079
would be a much better way of going

923
00:37:16,199 --> 00:37:20,838
about it I think the plant would get

924
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:22,800
quite stable nutrition that way so I

925
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:24,960
would fertilize that stuff more or less

926
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:28,400
like I'd fertilize the field so you

927
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:31,720
would top dress with these uh dry

928
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:33,200
amendments or nutrients uh over over the

929
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:34,480
course of the plant's life like you

930
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:36,879
would in your garden is what you're

931
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,920
suggesting yeah I put as much of it as I

932
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:41,880
could into the soil without making it

933
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:44,559
too hot and then uh add more on the

934
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:47,440
surfaces the plant grw from what I know

935
00:37:44,559 --> 00:37:49,559
about growing cannabis you actually want

936
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,519
to feed the crop quite differently

937
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:53,440
depending on whether it's flowering or

938
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:55,199
whether it's vegetating when it's

939
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,960
vegetating you want to feed it lots of

940
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:59,919
nitrogen and lots of potassium and a

941
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:01,920
fair amount of phosphorus and all the

942
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:03,720
trace elements oh we'll get into this

943
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:06,200
when we talk about fol your feeding and

944
00:38:03,719 --> 00:38:08,919
all that sort of thing anyway you really

945
00:38:06,199 --> 00:38:12,159
want that heavy and then when the plant

946
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:15,039
goes into bloom it's not making a lot of

947
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:17,239
vegetation anymore Growers need to

948
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:19,800
understand that mostly what nitrogen

949
00:38:17,239 --> 00:38:22,719
gets used for is to make chlorophyll

950
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:24,880
chlorophyll is is a protein uh it's

951
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:27,598
nitrogen Rich so when the plant's

952
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:29,440
constructing leaves it needs a lot of

953
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:31,119
nitrogen and then the leaves are nice

954
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,519
dark green and they have a lot of active

955
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:34,640
chlorophyll in them and they make a lot

956
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:35,800
of sugar and they do a good job when the

957
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:38,598
plant starts to

958
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:41,160
bloom uh you know it stops making leaves

959
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:43,720
it starts making flower Mass this Mass

960
00:38:41,159 --> 00:38:46,078
doesn't have very much chlorop and theol

961
00:38:43,719 --> 00:38:47,919
cannabis Growers are try to breed the

962
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:50,240
leaves out of these flower structures as

963
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:53,440
much as possible because they're they're

964
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:55,159
less harsh uh when you smoke them they

965
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,119
talk about don't they talk about a ratio

966
00:38:55,159 --> 00:38:59,000
kind of of like CX to leaves and that

967
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:00,680
sort of thing they they want lots and

968
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,079
lots of stigmas and lots and lots of

969
00:39:00,679 --> 00:39:04,239
seed bracks but very little in the way

970
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:07,119
of leafy

971
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:09,039
structure or am I wrong toad yeah

972
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:11,079
essentially what they want the most

973
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:13,639
valuable part of the crop in most cases

974
00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:16,039
which is uh not the fan leaves you know

975
00:39:13,639 --> 00:39:18,719
we want yeah they want Tricom density

976
00:39:16,039 --> 00:39:22,000
but then when we're looking at that

977
00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:24,159
plant growth uh you know bud formation

978
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,280
and things like that there are nutrient

979
00:39:24,159 --> 00:39:29,239
certain nutrients that are tied to this

980
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:30,920
but in addition to just these macro or

981
00:39:29,239 --> 00:39:33,719
major nutrients that we're talking about

982
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:36,039
right now that nitrogen phosphorus uh

983
00:39:33,719 --> 00:39:38,559
potassium calcium sulfur one of the

984
00:39:36,039 --> 00:39:40,880
things that I think that you have really

985
00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:43,480
promoted is adding in all these trace

986
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:46,640
minerals so oh yeah by by getting these

987
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:49,480
rock dusts into the soil we're going to

988
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:52,440
increase the the tpine levels the triome

989
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:55,039
density the the quality of the final

990
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:57,480
crop while also increasing the overall

991
00:39:55,039 --> 00:39:59,159
health and yield of the plant yeah now

992
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:02,039
actually Tad there's something that you

993
00:39:59,159 --> 00:40:04,399
could do that it wouldn't be free for

994
00:40:02,039 --> 00:40:08,199
you to do it but uh you could answer a

995
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:11,000
really major question for me okay

996
00:40:08,199 --> 00:40:13,039
because you are using Rock dusts okay

997
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,599
I've always had a lot of reservations

998
00:40:13,039 --> 00:40:18,920
about rock dust when I lived in Oregon

999
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:21,280
there was a quarry into the old Cascades

1000
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:24,400
Bessel and it was located right along

1001
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:26,680
Interstate 5 between Cottage Grove and

1002
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:29,358
crestwell Oregon and you could see it

1003
00:40:26,679 --> 00:40:31,879
when you went up the highway they M bass

1004
00:40:29,358 --> 00:40:35,279
salt for road base and things like that

1005
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:36,640
Crush Rock and you could get dust if you

1006
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,560
wanted you could just go there with

1007
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:40,759
buckets and at the base of the conveyor

1008
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:42,119
belt the dust Rock Dust just piled up as

1009
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:43,520
deep as you wanted to shovel it up and

1010
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:46,599
take it away and they were just as happy

1011
00:40:43,519 --> 00:40:48,519
to see you do that so I tried it and

1012
00:40:46,599 --> 00:40:50,920
used a whole lot of it and didn't seem

1013
00:40:48,519 --> 00:40:52,800
to do a great deal didn't seem to make

1014
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:56,000
much difference that I could tell and I

1015
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:59,480
got an analysis of it it actually has in

1016
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:02,079
it all the trace elements that you want

1017
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:04,280
but when you analyze the parts per

1018
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:06,880
million and then think about how much

1019
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:09,720
you're actually spreading and if it's if

1020
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:13,079
I'm spreading a ton of rock dust and uh

1021
00:41:09,719 --> 00:41:15,919
it's three parts per million zinc well

1022
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:19,079
in a ton there's what is that is that a

1023
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:21,440
million a million grams anyway I think a

1024
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:23,119
ton is something like a million G so if

1025
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:25,039
it's three parts per million it means

1026
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:28,720
that in a ton of that stuff I got three

1027
00:41:25,039 --> 00:41:32,199
G of Elemental Z you see in a ton now

1028
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:35,959
when I Sprint zinc sulfate I want to SP

1029
00:41:32,199 --> 00:41:39,439
spread like seven pounds of Elemental

1030
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:41,400
zinc on an acre and that's soluble see

1031
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:44,200
so that goes out of zinc sulfate and it

1032
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:45,960
goes into the soil solution and then it

1033
00:41:44,199 --> 00:41:47,598
attaches itself under the cat IR

1034
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:50,358
exchange capacity if it's not

1035
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:52,838
immediately picked up by a plant and uh

1036
00:41:50,358 --> 00:41:55,358
it sits there as available zinc to feed

1037
00:41:52,838 --> 00:41:57,838
the crop and I put 7 pounds of available

1038
00:41:55,358 --> 00:42:00,318
zinc basically into that field uh into

1039
00:41:57,838 --> 00:42:03,358
the fural slice into the top 100 top six

1040
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:05,358
Ines of the soil and if I put out a ton

1041
00:42:03,358 --> 00:42:07,480
of rock dust I'm putting out say three

1042
00:42:05,358 --> 00:42:09,440
lounds of potentially available dink

1043
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:12,358
someday when the stuff completely breaks

1044
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:14,599
down whenever that happens so how much

1045
00:42:12,358 --> 00:42:16,480
unavailable zinc would I have to put out

1046
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:18,720
to actually make S pounds of zinc

1047
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:20,440
available on the exchange sites when you

1048
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:23,358
start to ask that question it starts to

1049
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:25,240
look like we're talking 15 20 30 40 tons

1050
00:42:23,358 --> 00:42:27,279
of the acre I I think I can give a

1051
00:42:25,239 --> 00:42:29,358
little bit of input on this so one thing

1052
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:31,319
I want to distinguish before we go too

1053
00:42:29,358 --> 00:42:33,799
much further is that when we put out

1054
00:42:31,318 --> 00:42:36,039
rock dust or we add Alfalfa into our

1055
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:38,079
soil uh we're not directly feeding our

1056
00:42:36,039 --> 00:42:40,440
plant but rather feeding these uh

1057
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:42,720
microbes that are in the soil that are

1058
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:44,400
cycling these nutrients into a form that

1059
00:42:42,719 --> 00:42:46,679
the plant can uptake so another

1060
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,318
important aspect of gardening and

1061
00:42:46,679 --> 00:42:50,558
growing and farming is the is the

1062
00:42:48,318 --> 00:42:52,480
microbial populations that we have in

1063
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:55,040
our soils and that's where high quality

1064
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:56,559
compost becomes really important right I

1065
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:59,639
knew you were going to say that by the

1066
00:42:56,559 --> 00:43:01,599
way that's also the uh party line of the

1067
00:42:59,639 --> 00:43:03,480
rock dust people who are pushing rock

1068
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:06,280
dust and saying it's a solution it's how

1069
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:08,519
they explain it and I've always had my

1070
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:11,200
doubts I mean I just I'm I'm from

1071
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:14,280
Missouri man you got to show me so what

1072
00:43:11,199 --> 00:43:16,318
I'm saying Tad is you could show me you

1073
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:18,800
there is a way you could show me it's

1074
00:43:16,318 --> 00:43:21,639
real interesting all you got to do is

1075
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:23,280
have some tissue testing done take some

1076
00:43:21,639 --> 00:43:24,759
of the nice leaves from some of your

1077
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,760
cannabis that you've been growing with

1078
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:28,640
this rock dust in the medium

1079
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:32,319
and send them off to a lab that does

1080
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:34,719
leaf analysis and find out uh if the

1081
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:37,719
levels of copper and zinc and manganese

1082
00:43:34,719 --> 00:43:41,039
and Boron and that and uh in the leaves

1083
00:43:37,719 --> 00:43:43,239
are what you'd want unfortunately here

1084
00:43:41,039 --> 00:43:45,079
in Washington there is no uh tissue

1085
00:43:43,239 --> 00:43:47,759
testing as far as I'm aware of that's

1086
00:43:45,079 --> 00:43:49,559
legal for for cannabis um I believe

1087
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:51,599
maybe in Oregon it's possible but it's

1088
00:43:49,559 --> 00:43:53,240
not that's not something we can do yet

1089
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:55,240
oh that's right if you can't you can't

1090
00:43:53,239 --> 00:43:57,279
send the leaves to Oregon can you not

1091
00:43:55,239 --> 00:43:59,679
legally yeah we definitely can't mail

1092
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:01,640
any anything right so it's just not

1093
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:04,358
maybe possible to really answer this

1094
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:06,078
question you well well I think it is so

1095
00:44:04,358 --> 00:44:09,558
to give you a little more information

1096
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:12,880
when we mix our soils we're putting in

1097
00:44:09,559 --> 00:44:15,200
around 100 lbs of minerals and nutrients

1098
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:17,440
per yard of soil so very very high level

1099
00:44:15,199 --> 00:44:19,799
of amendment that that soil is going to

1100
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:22,800
actually heat up and thermally compost

1101
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:24,599
for at least two weeks yeah uh but while

1102
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:27,280
we're turning it and keeping it evenly

1103
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:29,359
moist before we can it'll even cool down

1104
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:31,280
to where we could plant into it so uh

1105
00:44:29,358 --> 00:44:34,358
we're putting in very very high levels

1106
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:36,519
of a lot of these of these nutrients for

1107
00:44:34,358 --> 00:44:39,960
in our soil well this container so if

1108
00:44:36,519 --> 00:44:43,119
you put a plant uh in 50 lers of this

1109
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:45,720
material that's a nice big pot right not

1110
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:47,920
a 12in pot say you put it into a 14inch

1111
00:44:45,719 --> 00:44:50,118
pot yeah something with a good volume of

1112
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:51,680
soil is there enough nutrients in there

1113
00:44:50,119 --> 00:44:54,358
that you can go plant from one end to

1114
00:44:51,679 --> 00:44:56,719
the other on just nothing but water we

1115
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:58,880
found a sgon container is probably the

1116
00:44:56,719 --> 00:45:01,318
minimum and that that's going to vary

1117
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:03,680
based on how long you're uh vegging your

1118
00:45:01,318 --> 00:45:05,519
plant before you flip it into flour but

1119
00:45:03,679 --> 00:45:07,838
we are finding that yes you can go the

1120
00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:10,239
full cycle now in a smaller container

1121
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:12,078
like a 7 gallon we have a nutrient pack

1122
00:45:10,239 --> 00:45:14,479
which is essentially the dry amendment

1123
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:16,079
that we put into our original soil mix

1124
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:18,199
that we will Top dress the pot and

1125
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:19,640
scratch into the surface at the end of

1126
00:45:18,199 --> 00:45:22,399
the first and the end of the third week

1127
00:45:19,639 --> 00:45:24,480
of flow just a/2 cup to a cup per plant

1128
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:26,440
as a way to help it get those nutrients

1129
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:28,440
by the time it's ready to finish what

1130
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:30,720
we're finding is Growers that are doing

1131
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:33,599
raised beds indoors or giving the plant

1132
00:45:30,719 --> 00:45:35,838
more soil as we discussed are able to

1133
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:37,760
yeah are are able to grow uh larger

1134
00:45:35,838 --> 00:45:40,000
healthier crops because one thing you

1135
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:42,079
may not be aware of is that in in the

1136
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:45,199
Cannabis industry traditionally what's

1137
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:48,720
happening is a grower is bringing soil

1138
00:45:45,199 --> 00:45:51,159
into into an indoor facility they are

1139
00:45:48,719 --> 00:45:53,838
maybe it's basement maybe it's a garage

1140
00:45:51,159 --> 00:45:56,960
maybe it's an actual warehouse and then

1141
00:45:53,838 --> 00:45:59,239
that soil is uh well soil or perlite

1142
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:02,000
whatever their media is I guess is then

1143
00:45:59,239 --> 00:46:04,558
uh fed with either bottled nutrients

1144
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:07,599
that are organic or ones that are ionic

1145
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:09,800
salts or you know conventional and then

1146
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:12,000
at the end of the cycle that soil that's

1147
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:13,480
typically grown conventionally with

1148
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,559
excessive nitrates and excessive

1149
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:18,039
phosphates is then put outside and

1150
00:46:15,559 --> 00:46:20,400
disposed of because the salt levels are

1151
00:46:18,039 --> 00:46:22,440
way too high they can't reuse it not

1152
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:25,119
without substantial leeching I imagine

1153
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:26,920
anyway yes so then that that soil that's

1154
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:28,800
primarily you know let's say cocoa based

1155
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:30,400
or just perlite based is then dumped out

1156
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,839
and leeching into our groundwater which

1157
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:33,358
is a whole another problem and then

1158
00:46:31,838 --> 00:46:35,599
they're having to buy and bring in new

1159
00:46:33,358 --> 00:46:39,440
soil new bottled nutrients and start

1160
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:41,280
over again so what uh myself and others

1161
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:44,358
have been working on is essentially

1162
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:47,400
creating a living soil indoors over time

1163
00:46:44,358 --> 00:46:50,799
by re amending these uh larger

1164
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:52,559
containers every cycle in place so we

1165
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:54,760
don't have to move the soil and out of

1166
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:56,480
the facility and uh we have some Growers

1167
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:59,440
that have been using the same soil up to

1168
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:01,199
5 years now by just adding back organic

1169
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:04,440
matter and adding nutrients back similar

1170
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:06,239
as you would find in nature right so if

1171
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:08,720
you did some soil testing on these

1172
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:10,959
containers at the end of every crop and

1173
00:47:08,719 --> 00:47:13,078
got an idea of what was there already

1174
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:14,760
you could then use sort of like the

1175
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:16,079
intelligent Garden approach and figure

1176
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:18,079
out what you needed to put in there to

1177
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:20,760
bring them back into balance yes though

1178
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:22,680
we do find that the uh the intelligent

1179
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:24,359
Gardener one doesn't allow for that

1180
00:47:22,679 --> 00:47:26,318
higher potassium and a few other things

1181
00:47:24,358 --> 00:47:30,239
that seem to be more specific to

1182
00:47:26,318 --> 00:47:33,440
cannabis what we do have uh lab tests or

1183
00:47:30,239 --> 00:47:36,078
soil tests with Logan that show how

1184
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:38,920
these levels are varying every crop

1185
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:41,000
cycle based on the nutrients that we're

1186
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:42,639
putting in at the beginning and at at

1187
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,519
the beginning of the cycle so we can see

1188
00:47:42,639 --> 00:47:47,759
more or less what the plant is taking

1189
00:47:44,519 --> 00:47:50,559
out of the soil over time so I I can I

1190
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:54,319
think yeah start to address your rock

1191
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:56,240
dust question uh in that regard yeah you

1192
00:47:54,318 --> 00:47:58,759
can you can clear that up for me

1193
00:47:56,239 --> 00:48:00,479
because being an organic Gardener I

1194
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:03,440
can't I don't feel comfortable adding a

1195
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:07,039
lot of these uh sulfates so things like

1196
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:08,838
uh zinc sulfate or copper sulfate um I

1197
00:48:07,039 --> 00:48:12,239
can't I don't think I can add them into

1198
00:48:08,838 --> 00:48:14,119
my soils according to NOP standards um

1199
00:48:12,239 --> 00:48:15,838
because they're not considered organic

1200
00:48:14,119 --> 00:48:18,039
same with manganese sulfate I would love

1201
00:48:15,838 --> 00:48:21,000
to know uh a good organic form of

1202
00:48:18,039 --> 00:48:23,239
manganese for example what is NLP uh the

1203
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:26,440
national organic program so it's sort of

1204
00:48:23,239 --> 00:48:30,159
the standard NLP I misund Mard here in

1205
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:33,800
Australia Organic certification agencies

1206
00:48:30,159 --> 00:48:35,960
will allow the grower to use sulfate

1207
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:37,960
salts of Trace elements if a soil

1208
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:39,679
analyst has determined by soil toast

1209
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:41,400
that these things are deficient that's

1210
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:45,239
the same law here but as someone who is

1211
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:47,519
a making soils from container media um

1212
00:48:45,239 --> 00:48:49,879
it's not something that I want to get

1213
00:48:47,519 --> 00:48:51,679
into adding into my soil initially

1214
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:53,838
because of the fact it isn't considered

1215
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:55,719
you know completely organic yeah do you

1216
00:48:53,838 --> 00:48:58,679
know of other sources for some of these

1217
00:48:55,719 --> 00:49:01,078
I know Kel meal is one that you you talk

1218
00:48:58,679 --> 00:49:03,759
a lot about and how would you feel about

1219
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:06,240
using Keel Trace elements that instead

1220
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:08,319
of being copper sulfate or copper

1221
00:49:06,239 --> 00:49:09,719
gluconate people who use them say that

1222
00:49:08,318 --> 00:49:11,558
you don't need to use much more than

1223
00:49:09,719 --> 00:49:13,679
about half as much to have the same

1224
00:49:11,559 --> 00:49:15,119
result is that the biomin copper that

1225
00:49:13,679 --> 00:49:18,078
you're referring to yeah that's sort of

1226
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:19,400
biomin biomin Trace elements you know I

1227
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:22,519
haven't looked into that product I

1228
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:24,880
believe it is Army certified though yeah

1229
00:49:22,519 --> 00:49:27,199
so you might feel okay you and your

1230
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:30,318
client base might feel okay about using

1231
00:49:27,199 --> 00:49:32,078
that stuff if it would be acceptable

1232
00:49:30,318 --> 00:49:34,639
theoretically I think you should

1233
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:36,480
experiment with it and see what it does

1234
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:38,239
for you if anything now do you know of a

1235
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:40,079
good source for manganese besides

1236
00:49:38,239 --> 00:49:41,798
manganese sulfate while we I know we

1237
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:44,000
touched on that a minute ago not unless

1238
00:49:41,798 --> 00:49:46,318
there's a biomune form of Manganese I

1239
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,719
don't know that's another difficulty

1240
00:49:46,318 --> 00:49:50,960
that I have you see where I live I'm way

1241
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:53,118
out at the end of a long supply chain

1242
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:55,519
and Australia is way out at the end of a

1243
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:57,798
long supply chain so you people in North

1244
00:49:55,519 --> 00:49:59,798
North America have a lot more materials

1245
00:49:57,798 --> 00:50:01,880
and possibilities available to you than

1246
00:49:59,798 --> 00:50:03,199
we do down here as far as I know I don't

1247
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:06,000
have any choice if I want to add

1248
00:50:03,199 --> 00:50:07,279
manganese I need manganese sulfate so

1249
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,920
just to sort of summarize what we've

1250
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:12,160
been talking about a little bit here for

1251
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:15,159
a grower to test his soil or test his

1252
00:50:12,159 --> 00:50:17,358
his container growing media find out

1253
00:50:15,159 --> 00:50:20,598
what those levels are based on a soil

1254
00:50:17,358 --> 00:50:24,759
test they can then go back and amend

1255
00:50:20,599 --> 00:50:26,440
their soils properly to bring any levels

1256
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:28,880
that are low or bring everything into

1257
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:30,960
balance yeah let me let me I got stop

1258
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:33,720
you here a little bit going backwards a

1259
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:35,798
few minutes you could use the levels

1260
00:50:33,719 --> 00:50:38,439
that are recommended in the intelligent

1261
00:50:35,798 --> 00:50:40,960
Gardener to grow cannabis with the

1262
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:43,440
exception of potassium so you could

1263
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:46,280
still use the the targets that the

1264
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:48,159
intelligent Gardener generates you see

1265
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:50,359
for all the other elements it's just

1266
00:50:48,159 --> 00:50:52,519
that you probably want at least twice as

1267
00:50:50,358 --> 00:50:54,719
much potassium as inell as the

1268
00:50:52,519 --> 00:50:56,119
intelligent Gardener calls for I totally

1269
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:58,358
agree with that we're finding the same

1270
00:50:56,119 --> 00:51:00,119
thing with our trials as well here so

1271
00:50:58,358 --> 00:51:02,318
that makes a lot of sense to me yeah but

1272
00:51:00,119 --> 00:51:05,079
the amounts of nitrogen if you think

1273
00:51:02,318 --> 00:51:07,558
about cannabis as a high demand crop

1274
00:51:05,079 --> 00:51:10,599
during the time that it's in vegetative

1275
00:51:07,559 --> 00:51:13,839
growth and then as a very low demand

1276
00:51:10,599 --> 00:51:15,720
crop when it's blooming and make sure

1277
00:51:13,838 --> 00:51:17,920
that during all of that time you see

1278
00:51:15,719 --> 00:51:20,519
because low demand crops don't demand

1279
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:23,240
lower levels of Trace

1280
00:51:20,519 --> 00:51:25,559
elements or calcium they just really

1281
00:51:23,239 --> 00:51:27,679
mean lower levels of nitrogen because

1282
00:51:25,559 --> 00:51:29,240
are not making chlorophyll they're still

1283
00:51:27,679 --> 00:51:31,279
growing fast they're still building a

1284
00:51:29,239 --> 00:51:33,039
lot of mass just to clarify so what

1285
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:35,079
you're getting at is essentially that

1286
00:51:33,039 --> 00:51:37,519
because cannabis is an is an annual

1287
00:51:35,079 --> 00:51:40,119
plant an annual crop it's going to

1288
00:51:37,519 --> 00:51:42,480
naturally want to sesse or complete its

1289
00:51:40,119 --> 00:51:45,838
life cycle and that's what that the

1290
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:47,960
process of forming uh buds or flowers is

1291
00:51:45,838 --> 00:51:49,759
and during that process it doesn't need

1292
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:52,119
as much nitrogen because it's not trying

1293
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:53,760
to put on any vegetative growth that's

1294
00:51:52,119 --> 00:51:55,798
right in fact it might need a third as

1295
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:57,359
much nitrogen or even a quarter as much

1296
00:51:55,798 --> 00:51:59,639
nitrogen as it needed while it was

1297
00:51:57,358 --> 00:52:01,598
growing new leaves now on that subject

1298
00:51:59,639 --> 00:52:03,440
one thing that Jeff lenells talks about

1299
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:05,519
in in his book teaming with microbes is

1300
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:09,720
that the plant is really in control of

1301
00:52:05,519 --> 00:52:11,159
this process based on uh the exudates it

1302
00:52:09,719 --> 00:52:13,639
it's putting out into the soil to

1303
00:52:11,159 --> 00:52:16,519
control sort of the the nutrient cycling

1304
00:52:13,639 --> 00:52:17,920
in microbial Loop um what's going on

1305
00:52:16,519 --> 00:52:21,199
there in the in the area around the

1306
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:24,639
roots yeah do you have any any thoughts

1307
00:52:21,199 --> 00:52:27,439
or comments on that um it's just a sort

1308
00:52:24,639 --> 00:52:29,759
of gut level feeling and I hope you take

1309
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:32,358
this the right way tab but see people

1310
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:35,400
who want to believe in Organics and I

1311
00:52:32,358 --> 00:52:37,519
say want to believe in Organics then

1312
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:40,639
they uh adjust things so that they make

1313
00:52:37,519 --> 00:52:42,239
a good story it's a good narrative okay

1314
00:52:40,639 --> 00:52:44,358
and that's what I think you're hearing

1315
00:52:42,239 --> 00:52:46,318
there and it there's some truth to it

1316
00:52:44,358 --> 00:52:48,719
and it does happen I've been learning

1317
00:52:46,318 --> 00:52:51,639
all kinds of things about how plants

1318
00:52:48,719 --> 00:52:53,719
talk to the microbes in their root Zone

1319
00:52:51,639 --> 00:52:55,838
get a collaborative relationship going

1320
00:52:53,719 --> 00:52:57,279
on I wouldn't even mind talking about

1321
00:52:55,838 --> 00:53:00,039
that it's really quite exciting

1322
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:03,480
information I've been finding out how to

1323
00:53:00,039 --> 00:53:05,558
wind my plants up another 25 or 30% more

1324
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:07,838
than they ever were before by fol or

1325
00:53:05,559 --> 00:53:10,000
feeding them the same kind of elements

1326
00:53:07,838 --> 00:53:13,558
that we've been talking about I've

1327
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:15,559
discovered that plants cannot obtain all

1328
00:53:13,559 --> 00:53:18,000
the nutrients that they could use if

1329
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:20,079
they could but get them not out of the

1330
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,880
soil it doesn't matter what you put into

1331
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:24,519
the soil it doesn't matter how

1332
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:27,119
concentrated the soil is the plant could

1333
00:53:24,519 --> 00:53:30,719
use more of certain things at certain

1334
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:32,720
times and if it gets them there's a

1335
00:53:30,719 --> 00:53:35,159
dramatic Improvement in the way that

1336
00:53:32,719 --> 00:53:37,838
plant grows the way you uh do that is

1337
00:53:35,159 --> 00:53:39,679
with fold of your feeding you see that

1338
00:53:37,838 --> 00:53:42,759
sounds really interesting Steve I would

1339
00:53:39,679 --> 00:53:45,078
love to uh do another segment talking

1340
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:47,200
more about that now that the Growers

1341
00:53:45,079 --> 00:53:50,240
have a little bit of a foundation into

1342
00:53:47,199 --> 00:53:51,879
your philosophies and why this process

1343
00:53:50,239 --> 00:53:53,719
is important U I think it would be

1344
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:55,318
wonderful to have you back on to talk

1345
00:53:53,719 --> 00:53:58,519
about that we'll go there another time

1346
00:53:55,318 --> 00:54:00,599
time you could write another book I

1347
00:53:58,519 --> 00:54:02,880
don't think so you younger people are

1348
00:54:00,599 --> 00:54:04,480
going to work this stuff out I'm 74 now

1349
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:06,119
you know I'm just happy to get up now

1350
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:09,440
and feel good today and go out there and

1351
00:54:06,119 --> 00:54:11,680
grow a few veggies sure I really am not

1352
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:14,280
out to try to learn the whole thing as

1353
00:54:11,679 --> 00:54:16,719
much as I've already done I'm kind of

1354
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:18,680
content at the moment so what what kind

1355
00:54:16,719 --> 00:54:20,798
of loose ends if we leaveing dangling we

1356
00:54:18,679 --> 00:54:23,039
must have not finish all kinds of things

1357
00:54:20,798 --> 00:54:25,159
in this conversation where would you

1358
00:54:23,039 --> 00:54:26,920
like to go boy you know I think we

1359
00:54:25,159 --> 00:54:29,399
covered a lot of it I would love to

1360
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:31,200
follow up with you in another talk to

1361
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:34,280
talk a little bit more about sort of the

1362
00:54:31,199 --> 00:54:36,439
connection between microbes and the soil

1363
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:38,480
food web and this idea of

1364
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:41,480
remineralization and how those two camps

1365
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:43,440
have sort of been um butting heads uh in

1366
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:45,519
in terms of their philosophies for for

1367
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:47,280
many years and then I would love to talk

1368
00:54:45,519 --> 00:54:49,838
to you again about this foler feeding

1369
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:51,680
idea that and how what your findings are

1370
00:54:49,838 --> 00:54:53,838
with that as well and I would like to

1371
00:54:51,679 --> 00:54:55,679
see a Logan leb's report on some of

1372
00:54:53,838 --> 00:54:57,400
these deep soil bits that you've been

1373
00:54:55,679 --> 00:54:59,960
running for five years and see what

1374
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:01,358
Logan says they look like I can show you

1375
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:03,400
a bunch of tests on that I think you'll

1376
00:55:01,358 --> 00:55:05,159
find it really interesting I would enjoy

1377
