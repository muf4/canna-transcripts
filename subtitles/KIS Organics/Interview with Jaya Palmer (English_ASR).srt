00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:01,819
for sustainable human settlement and

20
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:03,739
cognitive liberty his mission is to

21
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:05,689
excite and inspire people to utilize

22
00:01:03,738 --> 00:01:07,879
cannabis as a fulcrum to raise

23
00:01:05,688 --> 00:01:09,888
consciousness Jaya believes we can

24
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:12,138
realize the genetic potential of plants

25
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:13,849
with organic regenerative methods that

26
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:14,958
focus on feeding and diversifying

27
00:01:13,849 --> 00:01:18,169
biology and soil

28
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:19,880
I met Jaya back in 2011 literally on the

29
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:21,888
day I was mixing one of my first batches

30
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:22,759
of our kiss soil at the time I was

31
00:01:21,888 --> 00:01:24,589
running our family business

32
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:26,478
manufacturing compost tea brewing

33
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:28,009
machines we hit it off pretty quickly

34
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:29,688
talking about different aspects of

35
00:01:28,009 --> 00:01:31,159
growing and since that time Jaya has

36
00:01:29,688 --> 00:01:33,199
been the one coordinating much of our

37
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:35,329
field research and testing and one of my

38
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,368
go-to guys regarding beneficial insects

39
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:37,848
lighting product testing and much much

40
00:01:37,368 --> 00:01:39,799
more

41
00:01:37,849 --> 00:01:42,079
without further ado though here's our

42
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:44,149
latest conversation I started off asking

43
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:46,848
him a bit about how we first met in a

44
00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:50,028
little more of his personal history yeah

45
00:01:46,849 --> 00:01:53,028
when I I met you or I seeked you out

46
00:01:50,028 --> 00:01:55,248
because I had just got back from Elaine

47
00:01:53,028 --> 00:01:58,488
Ingham so food web week-long intensive

48
00:01:55,248 --> 00:02:01,039
and we did you know we covered compost

49
00:01:58,489 --> 00:02:04,340
compost tea microscopy and so I came

50
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:05,840
back to Seattle looking for anyone who

51
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:07,668
looked at their soil or compost under a

52
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,219
microscope and you were the only person

53
00:02:07,668 --> 00:02:12,979
who was doing that and you were kind of

54
00:02:10,219 --> 00:02:14,300
you were one of the one of the heads one

55
00:02:12,979 --> 00:02:17,569
of the leaders in that

56
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:19,910
tea movement for that I was living in I

57
00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:22,789
was I was living in a farm on snow home

58
00:02:19,909 --> 00:02:24,289
it in Snohomish growing about a hundred

59
00:02:22,789 --> 00:02:26,659
different types of veggies on several

60
00:02:24,289 --> 00:02:28,639
acres and managing the farmers market

61
00:02:26,659 --> 00:02:31,069
every week and growing a whole bunch of

62
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:34,729
tomatoes about four thousand square feet

63
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:36,199
of organic tomatoes and I got that farm

64
00:02:34,729 --> 00:02:39,969
certified organic when I was working out

65
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:43,759
there and at the time my best friend was

66
00:02:39,969 --> 00:02:47,120
growing medical cannabis in cocoa with

67
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:49,009
botanic here nutrients and having a lot

68
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,140
of troubles with it so I was trying to

69
00:02:49,009 --> 00:02:53,810
apply what I was doing with tomatoes it

70
00:02:51,139 --> 00:02:57,409
was going really well to cannabis and it

71
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:59,629
wasn't it wasn't very competitive and so

72
00:02:57,409 --> 00:03:02,210
we we kind of decided that this pure

73
00:02:59,629 --> 00:03:04,579
blend pro 1/2 organic half synthetic

74
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:06,170
approach was the best way to do it and

75
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:09,050
that's what we were learning from the

76
00:03:06,169 --> 00:03:12,319
grow shops and then when we tried your

77
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:15,620
soil the kit the kiss soil it yielded

78
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:18,289
easily 20 30 percent more than what we

79
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:20,239
were doing and it was way easier so I

80
00:03:18,289 --> 00:03:22,579
gave you some of that soil back in the

81
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,080
back in the day when you showed up as a

82
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:27,410
sample and then you just threw a plant

83
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,959
in it and that sort of started the

84
00:03:27,409 --> 00:03:31,939
process and then your buddy expanded

85
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:33,620
upon it so your your friend was actually

86
00:03:31,939 --> 00:03:37,699
the one that started experimenting with

87
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:39,110
growing in beds and riyo all the riah

88
00:03:37,699 --> 00:03:43,189
mending and all of that and I know you

89
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:45,890
were instrumental working with him

90
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:49,189
during all that so can you talk a little

91
00:03:45,889 --> 00:03:50,958
bit about that process and how how you

92
00:03:49,189 --> 00:03:52,550
go about evaluating a product I think

93
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,640
that's an important thing for people to

94
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:57,920
consider as well well depending on how

95
00:03:55,639 --> 00:04:00,109
much I believe in the product will

96
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:02,869
determine how large of an area of the

97
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:04,880
garden to dedicate to it like we're

98
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:06,819
gonna do one plant or one light or a

99
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:09,560
quarter of the space or half the space

100
00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:12,859
when we started with the kiss soil we

101
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:14,479
did one plant and because it didn't seem

102
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:17,330
very believable to us that it was going

103
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:18,858
to work and then we were impressed so we

104
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:21,589
did one light and then we converted the

105
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:23,569
whole thing over so we always have we

106
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:25,699
always have a control whenever we bring

107
00:04:23,569 --> 00:04:27,920
in something here to see to see you know

108
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:30,769
so we know if it actually works

109
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,100
and to quantify exactly how well it

110
00:04:30,769 --> 00:04:34,389
works

111
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:38,540
sit see if it justifies the expense and

112
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:40,610
then the the size of the container is

113
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:42,470
what changed the most

114
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:44,960
because in medical we were always

115
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:46,520
limited with a small plant count so

116
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:49,669
people would want to grow larger plants

117
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:52,219
and we just kept doing more and more

118
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:55,040
soil large and larger pots on the table

119
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:57,680
and became more easy to the point we had

120
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,910
fabric pots squished together and there

121
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,949
is roots growing through the sides of

122
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:03,290
the pots which was great because it was

123
00:05:00,949 --> 00:05:05,599
it was sort of homogenizing the the

124
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:07,730
water uptake and so a group of plants

125
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,100
would all take the same amount of water

126
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:13,129
per per square foot or perlite however

127
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:15,110
you want to look at it and so at that

128
00:05:13,129 --> 00:05:16,610
point we were like why don't we just put

129
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:19,520
size in this table and fill it up with

130
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:22,520
soil and we discovered that holds a lot

131
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:24,589
more soil but that's really where I

132
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:27,500
think you get the full potential out of

133
00:05:24,589 --> 00:05:29,449
the keep it simple soil sure or just

134
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,490
this style of cultivation I don't want

135
00:05:29,449 --> 00:05:33,019
to make it just about my company in my

136
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:35,470
products I know there's other people out

137
00:05:33,019 --> 00:05:37,909
there making these types of soils

138
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:40,640
totally obviously you and I have the

139
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:44,120
most experience with our recipe before

140
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:46,009
we get too far into soils I would like

141
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:48,740
to give listeners a little bit more of

142
00:05:46,009 --> 00:05:51,589
your background I know after we met you

143
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:53,180
started the Seattle mushroom farm you've

144
00:05:51,589 --> 00:05:55,189
done a lot of other things outside of

145
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:57,740
the cannabis world which i think is

146
00:05:55,189 --> 00:06:00,110
really cool I think I think we need to

147
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:01,879
get a lot of our our information and our

148
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,449
horticultural knowledge from beyond what

149
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:05,089
we're getting

150
00:06:02,449 --> 00:06:06,800
just with cannabis and just within

151
00:06:05,089 --> 00:06:08,269
people that are working with cannabis so

152
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,220
can you can you tell people a little bit

153
00:06:08,269 --> 00:06:11,659
more of your your permaculture

154
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,500
background some of the other things that

155
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:16,120
you've done

156
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:18,529
beyond cannabis yeah before I was

157
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:21,740
remotely concerned with cultivating

158
00:06:18,529 --> 00:06:23,959
cannabis my passion was gourmet mushroom

159
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:28,009
production indoor gourmet mushroom

160
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:29,659
production and I I build numerous clean

161
00:06:28,009 --> 00:06:31,339
rooms and fruity rooms at different

162
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:35,150
places I lived and with different

163
00:06:31,339 --> 00:06:37,609
partners the culmination of that was the

164
00:06:35,149 --> 00:06:39,560
the mushroom farm in Seattle and it was

165
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:41,790
a mini farm

166
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:44,790
my business partners backyard and

167
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:47,819
basement we took up most of the basement

168
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:51,360
and had our 12 by 12 fruiting room in

169
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:53,569
the backyard where we grew to about 200

170
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,340
maybe 300 pounds of mushrooms a month

171
00:06:53,569 --> 00:06:59,219
did it always for mushrooms and shitake

172
00:06:56,339 --> 00:07:01,799
maitake a little bit of racy for fun and

173
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:03,960
sold them to the local restaurants and

174
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:06,240
the farmers market that was an awesome

175
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:09,149
experience but I realized that I didn't

176
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,639
want to own a mushroom farm because it's

177
00:07:09,149 --> 00:07:14,699
just it's just too involved and before

178
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:15,930
that I lived for five years I lived

179
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:18,569
between two different intentional

180
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:19,259
communities and I was brilliant a

181
00:07:18,569 --> 00:07:22,019
permaculture

182
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:24,779
I I started studying permaculture in New

183
00:07:22,019 --> 00:07:27,479
Mexico with Rico Zook and then with

184
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:29,429
Starhawk in California and the Bullock

185
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,720
brothers on Orcas Island I've been out

186
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:33,240
for a couple of their courses and

187
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,970
they're there their site is amazing and

188
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:38,310
I've been to all the Paul Stamets

189
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:40,410
courses I'm much from production he's

190
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:42,540
got a cultivation seminar and a mycelium

191
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:45,030
running micro restoration seminar that

192
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:46,319
are both amazing he talks a mile a

193
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:48,149
minute ten hours a day

194
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:51,120
loses his voice at the end of court each

195
00:07:48,149 --> 00:07:53,849
course and it's it's really amazing to

196
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,649
see his setup so this is obviously your

197
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:57,750
growing is obviously your passion or

198
00:07:55,649 --> 00:08:00,599
cultivation in general and I know you've

199
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:03,029
more recently turned a lot of that

200
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:05,550
knowledge toward cannabis or even we

201
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:07,079
could just say indoor cultivation can

202
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:09,480
you talk about some of the things that

203
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:11,490
you're currently working on or things

204
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:13,950
that you're most excited about in that

205
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:17,759
realm you know I'm really excited by

206
00:08:13,949 --> 00:08:21,870
indoor AG because the the productive

207
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:23,339
potential is unmatched I want to get

208
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:25,620
more involved in in light that

209
00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:27,750
greenhouse light assisted production

210
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:30,329
because I think that's ultimately the

211
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:33,240
most sustainable way to grow it's just

212
00:08:30,329 --> 00:08:37,579
less so much less energy usage as long

213
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:40,110
as the heating is done sustainably

214
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:42,210
because there's really this this

215
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:44,399
argument that indoors not sustainable

216
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:45,930
because it uses so much electricity but

217
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,179
if our electricity comes from a clean

218
00:08:45,929 --> 00:08:50,309
source and our greenhouse production is

219
00:08:48,179 --> 00:08:52,679
using propane or natural gas for heating

220
00:08:50,309 --> 00:08:53,309
then that carbon footprint might be

221
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:56,549
worse than the

222
00:08:53,309 --> 00:08:58,709
power so I've really it can it's a

223
00:08:56,549 --> 00:09:01,679
concern of mine to go down the path that

224
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:03,450
makes most sense but indoor AG is just

225
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:07,289
so much more exciting be able to control

226
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:08,910
every environmental factor and control

227
00:09:07,289 --> 00:09:13,740
your water and control the air movement

228
00:09:08,909 --> 00:09:16,289
so it's really a laboratory you can you

229
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:20,700
can create slight variations and do

230
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:23,370
trials so easily I guess what I what I

231
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:26,759
feel like I bring is I kind of bring the

232
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:28,589
outdoors in because I think it's crucial

233
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:30,778
if you're gonna be organic it's crucial

234
00:09:28,589 --> 00:09:34,650
to use predatory bugs and use bio

235
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:36,990
controls and to to be mindful of crop

236
00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:38,750
rotation this sort of thing so I'm

237
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:41,580
hoping we can get the bug lady on here

238
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:43,049
I've sent her a message but can we talk

239
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,310
a little bit more about bug since I know

240
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:47,099
that's something that you have quite a

241
00:09:44,309 --> 00:09:49,829
bit of knowledge on if we wanted to talk

242
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:52,050
about IPM why don't we start there

243
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:55,080
so with integrated pest management I

244
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:58,079
know that there are not a lot of great

245
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:59,910
organic programs out there where do you

246
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,400
like to start with your sort of world

247
00:09:59,909 --> 00:10:05,730
and in terms of an organic IPM strategy

248
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:08,009
well IPM a lot of people say this is my

249
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:10,050
IPM program and they have a spray

250
00:10:08,009 --> 00:10:12,210
formula you know or a spray schedule and

251
00:10:10,049 --> 00:10:15,179
spring is not what you start out with

252
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:17,490
and with IP M you start out by scouting

253
00:10:15,179 --> 00:10:19,859
you look around to see if you have a

254
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:22,169
pest or what predators you have on site

255
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:23,820
and then you monitor them to keep track

256
00:10:22,169 --> 00:10:25,919
of their populations and make sure that

257
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:29,040
you're managing them below in economic

258
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:31,199
threshold and then when it's time to do

259
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:33,899
something about it spring everything

260
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,540
isn't always the solution because a

261
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:38,850
crucial part of every sustainable

262
00:10:36,539 --> 00:10:40,949
organic IPM program the repetitive mites

263
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:42,959
predatory beetles or it depends on what

264
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:46,339
what pests pressure you have in your

265
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:49,139
area but the basics that everyone should

266
00:10:46,339 --> 00:10:52,440
utilize are the the sole develop

267
00:10:49,139 --> 00:10:55,679
predatory mite which is straddle elapsed

268
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:58,500
Simha tests and then the Rove beetle

269
00:10:55,679 --> 00:11:01,169
which is DeLucie kori arya those two

270
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:04,830
will typically naturalize integral room

271
00:11:01,169 --> 00:11:06,490
in pots or in beds and you might not

272
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:09,940
need to reintroduce them for

273
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:11,080
a year longer but that's but monitoring

274
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:15,459
is important to make sure you still have

275
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:18,310
them and those guys maintain fungus

276
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:20,829
gnats and rude aphids below and economic

277
00:11:18,309 --> 00:11:24,729
threshold with no other products needed

278
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:28,480
the cemetery finding naturally in the

279
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:31,089
old mountain fish compost yes almost

280
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,709
every time sometimes I open up a bag of

281
00:11:31,089 --> 00:11:35,770
it and I don't see any of them but they

282
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:38,669
might still hatch out and when I've

283
00:11:35,769 --> 00:11:41,919
received yards of it many times it's

284
00:11:38,669 --> 00:11:44,769
disturbing how many predatory might turn

285
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:47,649
it like the compost is worth way more is

286
00:11:44,769 --> 00:11:51,009
a predatory mite you know inoculant than

287
00:11:47,649 --> 00:11:53,200
it is compost that's really that's

288
00:11:51,009 --> 00:11:54,939
really cool I think that goes back to it

289
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,480
having sat for so long being such a

290
00:11:54,940 --> 00:12:00,720
static compost pile yeah that's what

291
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:04,690
allows those larger organisms to come in

292
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:06,639
definitely and in compost composites

293
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:08,350
have been sitting around for a while

294
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:09,580
which is good you know leaving it static

295
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:11,800
for a while and get them follow counts

296
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:14,320
up that can bring in fungus gnats which

297
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:18,069
I don't see is a I see them as the most

298
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:21,278
minor pests I never see them get above

299
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:22,990
an economic threshold but uh anyways you

300
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:24,278
can get fungus gnats and compost both

301
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:26,799
these huge amounts of the predatory

302
00:12:24,278 --> 00:12:29,049
mites the fungus gnats are minimal or

303
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:30,759
sometimes not even there which is great

304
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:32,679
yes so when you talk about economic

305
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:34,269
threshold what you're saying is we're

306
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:37,269
not trying to create a cleanroom like

307
00:12:34,269 --> 00:12:39,759
you do with your mushroom production but

308
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:41,528
rather we're trying to manage these

309
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:44,889
organisms at a level to where they're

310
00:12:41,528 --> 00:12:47,939
not going to damage your problem exactly

311
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:51,250
so if you have a yellow sticky card

312
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:54,730
every 50 square feet and every day you

313
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:56,019
count 50 fungus gnats on it that's you

314
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:58,570
know this is that you've got to develop

315
00:12:56,019 --> 00:13:00,639
some sort of SOP to monitor your pest

316
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:04,120
populations and be clear about what your

317
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:07,299
definition of light medium or heavy pest

318
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:10,360
pressure is if you have low to medium

319
00:13:07,299 --> 00:13:12,429
fungus gnat pressure it's not affecting

320
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:14,200
yields it's not at an economic threshold

321
00:13:12,429 --> 00:13:15,429
it could be a problem if you're taking

322
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,589
cuttings you don't have fungus gnats

323
00:13:15,429 --> 00:13:19,750
when you're propagating but it takes

324
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:20,320
really high populations of them for to

325
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:23,409
decrease your

326
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,000
Oh their crop quality and so if it's

327
00:13:23,409 --> 00:13:27,189
getting to a point where it could affect

328
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,769
your yield then you have to do something

329
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:32,170
about it like use a product and so the

330
00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:34,840
economic threshold then is is applying

331
00:13:32,169 --> 00:13:37,509
this product going to be less expensive

332
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:39,670
than ignoring the pests yeah and I find

333
00:13:37,509 --> 00:13:42,490
fungus that's anytime you bring in any

334
00:13:39,669 --> 00:13:43,719
organic matter like compost or something

335
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:45,159
like that you're exposing yourself to

336
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:47,560
fungus gnats and like you said they're

337
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:49,360
really not that big of a deal relatively

338
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:51,309
speaking I have a blog post already on

339
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,919
dis organics for fungus gnats so I would

340
00:13:51,309 --> 00:13:55,449
say just people can start there but

341
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:56,229
let's talk about other problems that

342
00:13:55,450 --> 00:14:00,190
people are dealing with

343
00:13:56,230 --> 00:14:02,500
I know spider mites broad and hemp

344
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:04,720
russet mites those would be two things

345
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:06,399
that I know you've put a lot of time in

346
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,139
researching what are your experiences

347
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,490
there

348
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:12,129
you know spider mites are pretty easy to

349
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:16,029
knock out with with a with a light spray

350
00:14:12,129 --> 00:14:18,460
spray oil or soap whatever there's

351
00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:20,350
really everything I've tried on spider

352
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:22,870
mites works to get their populations

353
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:24,300
down but it's hard to wipe out a hundred

354
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:26,710
percent of them it's totally possible

355
00:14:24,299 --> 00:14:29,199
but I always tell people to if you're

356
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:31,629
dealing with spider mites spray a few

357
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:34,060
times three days apart to get the

358
00:14:31,629 --> 00:14:37,480
populations very low and then release

359
00:14:34,059 --> 00:14:39,699
per symbolist or flashes to clean up

360
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,649
what's left if you're trying to knock

361
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:44,320
them out quickly you can get the mites

362
00:14:41,649 --> 00:14:45,939
ship loose on bran or vermiculite and

363
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,460
put and you can sprinkle them on the top

364
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:50,080
of the plants and that really and that

365
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:53,519
can actually wipe out spider mites and

366
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:56,379
there's also if you don't think you have

367
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:58,569
populations of pests or you know they're

368
00:14:56,379 --> 00:15:01,779
very low you can get time relief sachets

369
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:04,720
where the predatory mites slowly crawl

370
00:15:01,779 --> 00:15:06,789
out of a little sack that hangs from the

371
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,590
plants over the course of two or four

372
00:15:06,789 --> 00:15:10,449
weeks and they're really affordable

373
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:13,860
really easy to use they're really

374
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:16,690
effective and you can get the sachets of

375
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:20,409
and or Sony and source kiai which are

376
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:23,170
predators that predate the rusted mites

377
00:15:20,409 --> 00:15:24,329
and broad mites so these would be good

378
00:15:23,169 --> 00:15:27,699
so we don't want to be spraying

379
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:30,250
botanical oils or soaps that are gonna

380
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:31,810
kill these predatory mites we want to go

381
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:33,740
ahead and get that spring done ahead of

382
00:15:31,809 --> 00:15:35,959
time if we need to do it and

383
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:38,180
as a preventative and a maintenance plan

384
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,870
you bring in these mites after the fact

385
00:15:38,179 --> 00:15:42,109
is that right

386
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:44,450
got it okay cool and one other thing I

387
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:47,720
want to differentiate is that if we're

388
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:49,550
four weeks into flower it's really too

389
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:52,040
late at that point to treat a lot of

390
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:53,750
these things in my experience the the

391
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:55,519
predatory mites are not going to be fast

392
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:57,679
enough acting you don't want be spraying

393
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,029
on these botanical oils you're sort of

394
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:00,529
screwed at that point so it's really

395
00:15:59,029 --> 00:16:02,120
important as you're going into flower

396
00:16:00,529 --> 00:16:04,549
that you have a clean crop that you have

397
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:06,320
a plan in place and that you have the

398
00:16:04,549 --> 00:16:07,939
mites that you want ready to go

399
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,190
is that accurate there's anything you

400
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:12,110
want to add to that yeah I mean you

401
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:15,500
there are some products you can spray

402
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:17,779
later in flower but there's not many of

403
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:19,039
them and if you do spray something like

404
00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:20,509
that I would have washed it off

405
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:23,449
immediately afterwards

406
00:16:20,509 --> 00:16:27,289
yeah the Predators do usually take a

407
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:29,840
couple weeks to catch up and a lot of

408
00:16:27,289 --> 00:16:31,909
them don't navigate the trichomes they

409
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:33,110
don't want to go up there so if you

410
00:16:31,909 --> 00:16:36,199
sprinkle them on the top it kind of

411
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:39,110
forces them into the zone but definitely

412
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:40,940
after week around week four keep it

413
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:43,149
clean cool cool so is there anything

414
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:46,460
else you want to talk about regarding

415
00:16:43,149 --> 00:16:47,809
mites or Russert mites or specifically

416
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:51,019
broad mites do you have any particular

417
00:16:47,809 --> 00:16:54,319
favor favorites praise or remedies

418
00:16:51,019 --> 00:16:56,929
around that the first thing when I first

419
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:59,000
dealt with broad mites I was testing all

420
00:16:56,929 --> 00:17:02,719
the products from the from the garden

421
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:05,569
store SNS products sulfur Schaefer soap

422
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,970
and I was you know diluting them to the

423
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:10,189
proper rate and then applying to the

424
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:11,990
broad mites under the scope I spent a

425
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:14,390
good solid week and a half of my life

426
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:16,309
doing this and they thought it might

427
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:18,050
just swam around and everything except

428
00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:20,750
for green cleaner of all things old

429
00:17:18,049 --> 00:17:23,389
stage green cleaner which is it's a

430
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:24,859
soybean and soap product it's a twenty

431
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:27,770
five be compliant which means it doesn't

432
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:29,990
need a BPA registration I think it's

433
00:17:27,769 --> 00:17:32,629
overpriced for what it is but it works

434
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:34,849
and it's gentle on plants but there's

435
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:38,870
also products that are listed for broad

436
00:17:34,849 --> 00:17:40,549
mites like eco Tech or eco trawl they're

437
00:17:38,869 --> 00:17:43,069
really those are similar formulas and

438
00:17:40,549 --> 00:17:45,500
that's a essential oil product that's

439
00:17:43,069 --> 00:17:47,269
Amarillo salt and that's an armory

440
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:50,150
listed product

441
00:17:47,269 --> 00:17:52,599
and there's also horticultural oils if

442
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:55,460
people don't mind using a petroleum oil

443
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:57,379
there's these mineral oil type of

444
00:17:55,460 --> 00:18:00,970
paraffinic oil products that are really

445
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:04,070
light and don't have any VOCs and

446
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:06,170
they're Omri listed and they work really

447
00:18:04,069 --> 00:18:08,389
well against all mites and powdery

448
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:12,680
mildew that was the JMS style of oil

449
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:16,490
that he told me about yeah JMS JMS

450
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:19,670
toilet oil is I believe the only Omri

451
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:21,349
powdery mildew a radicand it actually

452
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:24,650
destroys the powdery mildew that's

453
00:18:21,349 --> 00:18:25,309
rooted into the leaf tissue oh I hadn't

454
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:30,710
heard that

455
00:18:25,309 --> 00:18:32,149
yeah and cephalofoil ex is the other one

456
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:35,630
I like a lot that's a little bit more

457
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:36,950
common in Ag I know it works well on

458
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:39,440
powdery mildew but I don't know if it

459
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:43,340
has the same efficacy when you talk

460
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:45,130
about these these oil options weren't

461
00:18:43,339 --> 00:18:47,659
you also mixing the green cleaner with

462
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:48,950
high quality neem oil in the past is

463
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:52,519
that something you're still doing it

464
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:54,259
depends I definitely when I was dealing

465
00:18:52,519 --> 00:18:56,660
with broad mites at multiple locations

466
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:58,730
the green cleaner could we could

467
00:18:56,660 --> 00:19:01,250
eliminate broad mites with green cleaner

468
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:03,529
applications gesturing cleaner but if

469
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:05,599
there was only one green cleaner

470
00:19:03,529 --> 00:19:07,069
application and then like if it was

471
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:10,369
going to flower and we couldn't spray it

472
00:19:07,069 --> 00:19:12,409
again if we mix neem with it we could go

473
00:19:10,369 --> 00:19:15,979
a month without seeing a sign of a broad

474
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:18,980
mite so the neem really helped yeah I

475
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:22,579
was using ahimsa organics an ounce per

476
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:24,500
gallon of the himsa and 2 ounce per

477
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:27,289
gallon of the green cleaner oh and one

478
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:28,819
other thing to touch on is when you are

479
00:19:27,289 --> 00:19:31,220
spraying it's important to have multiple

480
00:19:28,819 --> 00:19:33,589
modes of action in there so it's never a

481
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:35,539
bad idea to do like say a green cleaner

482
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:38,929
neem oil application and then follow it

483
00:19:35,539 --> 00:19:40,970
with maybe that the GMs style and oil or

484
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:43,549
something else so you're not applying

485
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:45,860
say green cleaner every three days and

486
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:47,359
it's because the mites will build up a

487
00:19:45,859 --> 00:19:50,179
resistance or you they will be it will

488
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:51,259
be less effective over time and I think

489
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:53,810
that's something just that's important

490
00:19:51,259 --> 00:19:55,869
to point out as well great so we touched

491
00:19:53,809 --> 00:19:58,490
a little bit on some of the predatory

492
00:19:55,869 --> 00:20:00,379
mites do you wanna talk about powdery

493
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:00,650
mildew at all or your experience with

494
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:01,640
that

495
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:04,610
that's obviously something a lot of

496
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:09,770
people are dealing with yeah so powdery

497
00:20:04,609 --> 00:20:12,109
mildew most I think most growers think

498
00:20:09,769 --> 00:20:15,079
that your humidity should be in the 50s

499
00:20:12,109 --> 00:20:17,029
or 60s during flower and the relative

500
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:21,649
humidity forties or fifties during veg

501
00:20:17,029 --> 00:20:25,609
and that is just too dry too arid for

502
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:27,980
cannabis and so over the years we've

503
00:20:25,609 --> 00:20:29,779
found that lots of strains good powdery

504
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:31,220
mildew in our environment and there's

505
00:20:29,779 --> 00:20:32,450
some that don't and so we grow the ones

506
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:34,519
that don't get powdery mildew in this

507
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:38,210
environment and that's usually all we

508
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:41,210
need to do but now we learn more about

509
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:44,000
the vapor pressure deficit BPD and try

510
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:47,240
running our rooms around in the 70s even

511
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:53,089
like the mid to high 70s I could say 75%

512
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:57,980
humidity and 82 degrees or 72% humidity

513
00:20:53,089 --> 00:21:00,289
and 78 degrees at that VPD we find

514
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:02,210
powdery mildew dyes we can take a plant

515
00:21:00,289 --> 00:21:03,889
covered in powdery mildew put it in that

516
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:06,710
room and the powdery mildew turns brown

517
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:08,840
and dice and or if you want to spray it

518
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:11,509
off once with the soap product it stays

519
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:13,159
clean after that so a lot of people

520
00:21:11,509 --> 00:21:14,440
don't believe this because there's the

521
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:17,810
research saying the pattern mildew

522
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:20,390
spores will germinate more at higher

523
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:22,159
humidities which is true but the issue

524
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:24,830
is the powdery mildew lives on the plant

525
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:27,259
it's not living on the ground so if the

526
00:21:24,829 --> 00:21:29,480
plant is in the optimal environment then

527
00:21:27,259 --> 00:21:34,460
it has the ability to fight off that

528
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:35,990
infection the only caveat is if you run

529
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:38,090
a high VPD all the way to the end of

530
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:42,680
flower it can increase your chances of

531
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:44,990
getting botrytis but only if only if the

532
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:47,120
calyx is doing the dewpoint which is

533
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:48,319
essentially when the lights turn off the

534
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:50,000
temperature drops quickly and the

535
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:53,389
humidity Rises quickly and so you can

536
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:56,240
hit dewpoint in the flower and that is

537
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:58,310
how you get botrytis so turning off

538
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,079
lights slowly or having proper

539
00:21:58,309 --> 00:22:02,569
environment controls takes care of that

540
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:05,509
but we're still working out exactly how

541
00:22:02,569 --> 00:22:07,609
much we want to taper off the humidity

542
00:22:05,509 --> 00:22:09,920
towards the end of the flower cycle okay

543
00:22:07,609 --> 00:22:11,779
so this is a pretty controversial idea

544
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,170
that you just turn out there that goes

545
00:22:11,779 --> 00:22:15,329
against everything you

546
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:18,330
kind of learn as an indoor grower

547
00:22:15,329 --> 00:22:22,379
through you know conventional wisdom or

548
00:22:18,329 --> 00:22:25,619
stoner science or grow shops so just to

549
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:28,530
be clear you're saying run your humidity

550
00:22:25,619 --> 00:22:31,409
in your rooms based off of a VPD chart

551
00:22:28,529 --> 00:22:33,569
which I will link to one right on the

552
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:38,460
podcast page for those haven't seen it

553
00:22:33,569 --> 00:22:41,460
and by staying with an optimal VPD the

554
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:43,920
plant is actually able to fight off a

555
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:45,750
lot of these a lot of the PM problems

556
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:47,519
that you're seeing is that correct is

557
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:48,058
there anything I'm missing there that's

558
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:50,279
it

559
00:22:48,058 --> 00:22:51,928
I don't what is the guy's name who talks

560
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:54,359
about Plant Health that if you have a

561
00:22:51,929 --> 00:22:56,700
healthy plant they can fight off pests

562
00:22:54,359 --> 00:22:58,769
and whatnot you know who I'm talking

563
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:00,240
about yeah I don't I thought it might be

564
00:22:58,769 --> 00:23:01,470
Kemp I know there's people talking about

565
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,859
it around Kemp

566
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:07,798
John Kemp around yeah I think Brix

567
00:23:04,859 --> 00:23:10,139
levels and things like that yeah and so

568
00:23:07,798 --> 00:23:12,298
I don't know I don't know enough to know

569
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:14,090
if Kemp is is is right about all this

570
00:23:12,298 --> 00:23:17,970
stuff or if he's going a little bit too

571
00:23:14,089 --> 00:23:20,009
too far and the you know don't worry

572
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:21,509
about pestis for you about the plant

573
00:23:20,009 --> 00:23:23,460
health I'd I agree losing that you

574
00:23:21,509 --> 00:23:26,039
should prioritize plant health first and

575
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:27,660
optimize the plant immune system I use

576
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:29,819
that term loosely because the plant

577
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:31,919
immune system is it kind of is the

578
00:23:29,819 --> 00:23:33,359
environment and the soil and the the

579
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:36,390
rhizosphere it's all part of it

580
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:38,459
but if you optimize the environment if

581
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:41,490
you optimize the VPD you know other

582
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:42,569
environmental controls are in order then

583
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:44,870
yeah

584
00:23:42,569 --> 00:23:47,460
plants can just fight off the PM and

585
00:23:44,869 --> 00:23:51,058
it's and also when you go when you run

586
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:54,360
this this lower VPD which is higher

587
00:23:51,058 --> 00:23:57,450
humidity the plant physiology is much

588
00:23:54,359 --> 00:24:00,389
different too you get a longer internode

589
00:23:57,450 --> 00:24:02,429
and you get way more biomass like I'm

590
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:04,710
seeing plan to double or triple in

591
00:24:02,429 --> 00:24:07,620
height after the day they're clicked

592
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:10,319
over to flower which is opposed to a

593
00:24:07,619 --> 00:24:13,319
normal more arid standard room I'd see

594
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:16,168
plants grow by 50% or a hundred percent

595
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:18,389
you're talking about the end of the end

596
00:24:16,169 --> 00:24:20,340
time of harvest then the plants usually

597
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:22,860
rather than just growing 50% more than

598
00:24:20,339 --> 00:24:24,178
it was in veg so if it was three feet it

599
00:24:22,859 --> 00:24:25,929
finished at four-and-a-half feet you're

600
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:28,600
saying it's finished closer to say

601
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:32,019
yes okay so you've got to be prepared

602
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:34,329
for explosion of growth but it

603
00:24:32,019 --> 00:24:38,139
definitely correlates to you seeing

604
00:24:34,329 --> 00:24:40,389
higher trichome density also and I

605
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:42,400
haven't been able to compare can have a

606
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:44,590
no attached or terpenoid tests but I'm

607
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:49,090
assuming it'll be better so you're

608
00:24:44,589 --> 00:24:51,909
starting at around six let's say 70%

609
00:24:49,089 --> 00:24:54,879
humidity and then throughout flower

610
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:57,400
you're slowly transitioning it lower and

611
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,960
lower so where are you finishing at by

612
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,490
the time you get to harvest and how much

613
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:05,500
are you lowering it's a on a weekly

614
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:08,289
basis in veg if edges around 78 79

615
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:09,339
degrees and the humidity will be in at

616
00:25:08,289 --> 00:25:12,220
least 70%

617
00:25:09,339 --> 00:25:13,569
ideally 75 as long as it's there is a

618
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:16,120
point where if you're putting too much

619
00:25:13,569 --> 00:25:17,889
humidity in the air you can have you can

620
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:21,459
get condensation on walls or floors

621
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:24,009
anywhere where it's a cold area so I'm

622
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:28,120
finding I'm saying swampy are the better

623
00:25:24,009 --> 00:25:30,009
to an extent for veg but you've got to

624
00:25:28,119 --> 00:25:32,319
make sure it's not compromising your

625
00:25:30,009 --> 00:25:35,670
structure and in flower

626
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:38,470
I really am leaning towards 78 to 82 in

627
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:41,440
for temperature and around 75 percent

628
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:45,630
for humidity Wow so this this all this

629
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:50,559
all equates to like a point eight to one

630
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:52,540
VPD BPD's measured in kiloPascals so one

631
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:54,399
point eight to one that's kind of a zone

632
00:25:52,539 --> 00:25:55,960
for flower and then tapering it off just

633
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,420
a little bit towards the end in the last

634
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:01,630
three weeks of flower bringing the

635
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:04,390
humidity down about 5% so it's still in

636
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:06,400
the upper 60s wow that seems crazy high

637
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:07,690
to me I mean I haven't had a chance to

638
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,900
test this theory because I'm not

639
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:13,630
currently growing but I love the idea of

640
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:15,970
it based on what I'm learning through

641
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:18,610
you and others about vapor pressure

642
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:21,579
deficit I would say the sketchy thing is

643
00:26:18,609 --> 00:26:24,339
not how wet it is during the light cycle

644
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:26,230
it's when the light cycle ends in the

645
00:26:24,339 --> 00:26:28,119
temperature drops and you have that much

646
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:30,039
more water in the air and that's the

647
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:31,239
point where humidity is gonna shoot up

648
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:33,879
you know it's gonna show up into the 80s

649
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:36,609
or 90s if you don't have proper controls

650
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:39,310
so if you don't have the luxury of

651
00:26:36,609 --> 00:26:42,339
having these big dehumidifiers

652
00:26:39,309 --> 00:26:43,779
if you just do air exchange if you can

653
00:26:42,339 --> 00:26:47,019
do enough air exchange when the lights

654
00:26:43,779 --> 00:26:49,000
turn off to exhaust to evacuate all that

655
00:26:47,019 --> 00:26:50,950
air which is putting tons of watering

656
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:54,700
and bringing cooler drier air from the

657
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:56,860
outside that can cushion the cushion

658
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:59,140
that rise in humidity from when lights

659
00:26:56,859 --> 00:27:02,199
turn off okay so my experience with

660
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:04,870
humidity has primarily been with

661
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:09,279
vegetable crops outdoors and where I see

662
00:27:04,869 --> 00:27:11,439
big big swings in humidity say we have a

663
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:13,000
sunny day followed by a really rainy

664
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:16,029
cloudy day or vice-versa where that

665
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,680
humidity fluctuates dramatically I can

666
00:27:16,029 --> 00:27:20,259
guarantee that my squash plants are

667
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:23,620
gonna have powdery mildew within a day

668
00:27:20,259 --> 00:27:25,750
or two and I found that this seems to be

669
00:27:23,619 --> 00:27:28,449
the case with cannabis - to a certain

670
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:31,599
extent in that a lot of people are

671
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:34,150
taking a plant at you know relatively

672
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:36,809
relatively speaking a low level of light

673
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:39,940
or lower level of light in veg and

674
00:27:36,809 --> 00:27:42,190
higher humidity and then flip-flopping

675
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:44,860
it virtually overnight you know dropping

676
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:46,870
your humidity and raising your light

677
00:27:44,859 --> 00:27:48,789
intensity and I think that those are

678
00:27:46,869 --> 00:27:50,529
really creating a lot of the conditions

679
00:27:48,789 --> 00:27:52,659
that were for powdery mildew that we're

680
00:27:50,529 --> 00:27:54,849
seeing with these plants I mean do you

681
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:57,460
have any thoughts on that yeah

682
00:27:54,849 --> 00:27:59,529
so we at first rerunning them our

683
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:01,210
humidifiers only during the light cycle

684
00:27:59,529 --> 00:28:03,190
because that's when we thought we

685
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:05,980
thought we needed them exclusively and

686
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:07,570
we didn't want to over humidify it in

687
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:10,180
the dark cycle because that's where we

688
00:28:07,569 --> 00:28:12,460
knew the issues were but that wouldn't

689
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:14,710
if we put the plants which had p.m. on

690
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:16,960
them in that room and only humidified

691
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:19,120
during the day it didn't kill the PM we

692
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:21,789
had to keep the humidity high at the

693
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:22,719
keep - when I say humidity high I mean

694
00:28:21,789 --> 00:28:25,269
keep the VPD

695
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:27,370
at the appropriate level or in the

696
00:28:25,269 --> 00:28:29,470
appropriate range you have to do it 24

697
00:28:27,369 --> 00:28:33,969
hours a day otherwise it doesn't work

698
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:35,740
you know and p.m. needs temperature or

699
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:38,170
humidity flight is a temperature and

700
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:40,809
humidity I think it's temperature or

701
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:44,440
humidity it needs the fluctuation to

702
00:28:40,809 --> 00:28:45,730
sporulate so if you have a tight diff

703
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:48,509
your day to night temperature

704
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:51,009
differential then you won't get PM

705
00:28:48,509 --> 00:28:53,170
sporulating but it could still be there

706
00:28:51,009 --> 00:28:56,660
vegetatively it's harder to see that

707
00:28:53,170 --> 00:29:00,050
but these high VPD levels I found

708
00:28:56,660 --> 00:29:02,320
actually eliminated there's no size on

709
00:29:00,049 --> 00:29:05,899
belief anymore there's no none of the

710
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:07,339
hyphae okay so on that note when we talk

711
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:10,190
about we're talking about room

712
00:29:07,339 --> 00:29:11,929
conditions right now I was just at a

713
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:14,180
consultation the other day and I walked

714
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:17,808
in and they had a lot of fans going in

715
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:19,580
the room and they weren't in optimal VPD

716
00:29:17,808 --> 00:29:20,899
ranges which was one challenge and they

717
00:29:19,579 --> 00:29:24,079
were dealing with a lot of powdery

718
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:25,730
mildew what I found was the plants that

719
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:26,928
were in the middle of the room the ones

720
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:30,200
that were being subjected to the most

721
00:29:26,929 --> 00:29:31,970
airflow looked a lot worse than the ones

722
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:34,720
that were sort of neglected in the

723
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:37,308
corner more or less that weren't having

724
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:39,019
you know quite as much airflow right

725
00:29:37,308 --> 00:29:40,819
over the leaf surface you know affecting

726
00:29:39,019 --> 00:29:45,230
their bapple transpiration of the leaf

727
00:29:40,819 --> 00:29:47,029
how do we mitigate or properly control

728
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:48,558
that aspect of our environmental

729
00:29:47,029 --> 00:29:51,319
conditions

730
00:29:48,558 --> 00:29:53,839
you know it's you're right too much air

731
00:29:51,319 --> 00:29:55,849
movement can cause it can get it can

732
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:57,678
cause a plant to suffer from powdery

733
00:29:55,849 --> 00:29:59,389
mildew also but then not enough air

734
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:01,429
movement those leaves will get powdery

735
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:04,850
mildew so there is this sweet spot

736
00:30:01,429 --> 00:30:07,250
I think fluence was saying one meter one

737
00:30:04,849 --> 00:30:08,750
square foot per second or one meter for

738
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:11,179
a second they have a measurement for it

739
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:13,549
I just ordered a Nana na meter to

740
00:30:11,179 --> 00:30:14,750
measure wind speed so I can see you know

741
00:30:13,549 --> 00:30:16,579
so I can actually give you a number like

742
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:18,769
this is the wind speed you need above

743
00:30:16,579 --> 00:30:20,119
the canopy and then this is the wind

744
00:30:18,769 --> 00:30:22,910
speed you need below the canopy or

745
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:25,339
through the canopy to assure that you're

746
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:27,110
going to have enough air movement that

747
00:30:25,339 --> 00:30:28,669
the plant can breathe because if it's

748
00:30:27,109 --> 00:30:31,519
not getting if it's not enough air

749
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:32,779
movement to flush away the air right

750
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:35,839
underneath the leaf it's just not

751
00:30:32,779 --> 00:30:37,639
getting access to the co2 and and you

752
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:39,529
also get a little microclimate there you

753
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:40,759
can get these super humid micro climates

754
00:30:39,529 --> 00:30:44,178
if you know of air movement through the

755
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:47,839
canopy so it depends on the size of the

756
00:30:44,179 --> 00:30:50,509
space in smaller spaces wall mount fans

757
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:52,970
work great you just have to be mindful

758
00:30:50,509 --> 00:30:54,558
if you want them set in a higher speed

759
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:57,529
blowing above the canopy or a lower

760
00:30:54,558 --> 00:30:58,759
speed blowing at the canopy sometimes

761
00:30:57,529 --> 00:31:00,289
you can blow them at a high speed

762
00:30:58,759 --> 00:31:02,539
directly at the canopy but they have to

763
00:31:00,289 --> 00:31:04,579
be far enough away it's kind of

764
00:31:02,539 --> 00:31:06,539
something that you learn by feel like

765
00:31:04,579 --> 00:31:08,429
you want to see the leaves move

766
00:31:06,539 --> 00:31:11,430
but you want to see them move as little

767
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:13,019
as possible and then look at the plant

768
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:15,180
see if it's gonna yellow or if it's

769
00:31:13,019 --> 00:31:17,220
getting a little scratch mark looking

770
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:19,350
things along the veins you can tell it

771
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:22,140
or if it's the margin of the leaf is

772
00:31:19,349 --> 00:31:24,449
twisting up there's lots of wind stress

773
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:26,220
symptoms so you just kind of you know

774
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:28,019
communicate with the plant yeah it

775
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:32,279
anecdotally in our greenhouse we have a

776
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:34,589
85 by 30 foot greenhouse and we have two

777
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:37,769
big fans on either corner that helps

778
00:31:34,589 --> 00:31:41,730
circulate the air and I cannot grow

779
00:31:37,769 --> 00:31:43,379
cucumbers or tomatoes on the first two

780
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:45,390
rows right in front of that fan because

781
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:48,720
they get so much wind damage and wind

782
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:51,180
stress they well they look like crap

783
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:53,940
pretty quickly but the other thing I

784
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:56,370
find is that because they are stressed

785
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:58,799
and they are damaged then if I do have

786
00:31:56,369 --> 00:32:00,209
if I do get mites or powdery mildew or

787
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:01,950
any other disease those are gonna be the

788
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:03,680
first plants I'm gonna find them on so I

789
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:06,330
really do think there is something to

790
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:09,779
like you said creating this immune

791
00:32:06,329 --> 00:32:12,539
system around our plants by providing an

792
00:32:09,779 --> 00:32:14,369
optimal environment for them and the

793
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:16,680
ones that are less healthy are going to

794
00:32:14,369 --> 00:32:19,500
be more susceptible to expressing

795
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:21,630
powdery mildew and getting spider mites

796
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:23,789
and all of these other problems like you

797
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:27,150
mentioned do you have horizontal airflow

798
00:32:23,789 --> 00:32:30,119
fans in the greenhouse yes and that's

799
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:33,570
the that's the other that's the you know

800
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:35,789
the how all greenhouses generally have

801
00:32:33,569 --> 00:32:37,710
horizontal airflow fans where there's

802
00:32:35,789 --> 00:32:39,990
fans and 1/2 the greenhouse pointing one

803
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:41,100
direction and fans the other half the

804
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:43,319
greenhouse points the opposite direction

805
00:32:41,099 --> 00:32:46,649
so it's dirt keeps the air moving in a

806
00:32:43,319 --> 00:32:49,889
vortex and that's a really efficient way

807
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:52,860
to to get air circulation through the

808
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:54,509
canopy and it's actually easier to do it

809
00:32:52,859 --> 00:32:57,659
that way than it is with wall fans

810
00:32:54,509 --> 00:32:59,759
because it's it's just more consistent

811
00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:01,950
air flow throughout the space and it

812
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:03,930
gets air flow down by the ground also so

813
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:06,690
you can get air flow through the canopy

814
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:08,940
and you know by the soil okay so I know

815
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:12,120
we touched a little bit on lighting with

816
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:14,370
with Nelson can you talk a little bit

817
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:16,019
more though in terms of what your

818
00:33:14,369 --> 00:33:17,339
experience has been because you just

819
00:33:16,019 --> 00:33:21,150
recently I know said

820
00:33:17,339 --> 00:33:22,529
a room with LEDs which is a totally

821
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:25,410
different experience from what I'm

822
00:33:22,529 --> 00:33:28,940
understanding from your previous grows

823
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:32,130
with grow experience being around

824
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:34,529
double-ended HPS and even single-ended

825
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:37,260
HPS I can talk a little more about that

826
00:33:34,529 --> 00:33:39,509
maybe yeah that's been really fun the

827
00:33:37,259 --> 00:33:40,289
going from single ended to double end it

828
00:33:39,509 --> 00:33:43,140
was dramatic

829
00:33:40,289 --> 00:33:46,019
it's a 10 percent or 20 percent more

830
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:49,230
efficient and way better light footprint

831
00:33:46,019 --> 00:33:50,730
but we had a deal with hoods that were

832
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:53,309
that you know that were inducted and so

833
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:58,470
much more heat was HPS but it's it's

834
00:33:53,309 --> 00:34:02,339
worth it to use a non a non vented hood

835
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:04,890
with the de HPS and use a larger air

836
00:34:02,339 --> 00:34:08,009
conditioner it's worth it for the

837
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:10,769
production but it's so energy intensive

838
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:13,320
so we've been wanting LEDs to get there

839
00:34:10,769 --> 00:34:15,509
for a long time and up until last I

840
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:18,600
think is last August there's this great

841
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:20,100
article from Bruce Bugbee from Ohio

842
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:23,190
State University comparing the

843
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:28,819
efficiency of all sorts of greenhouse

844
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:32,130
lighting and de HPS lights were 1.7

845
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:34,230
micromoles per Joule and the best LEDs

846
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:36,150
in the market at the time were 1.7 also

847
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:39,500
and then fluence came out with their new

848
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:43,559
product line and they're all around 2.2

849
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:47,039
so much more efficient the spectrum is

850
00:34:43,559 --> 00:34:48,690
tailored to cannabis the way they're

851
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:50,789
designed they have really uniform

852
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:53,789
irradiance meaning wherever you check a

853
00:34:50,789 --> 00:34:56,719
light level across the canopy it's close

854
00:34:53,789 --> 00:34:59,070
to the same and they're waterproof

855
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:01,919
they're really easy to hang they're

856
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:04,230
gorgeous but they do have a learning

857
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:07,710
curve because the light is so intense

858
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:10,199
that you have to start them higher up or

859
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:12,269
dimmed and if a plant has never been

860
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:14,609
under LEDs before they have to be

861
00:35:12,269 --> 00:35:16,199
activated slowly because they can do

862
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:20,250
weird things like there's leaves can get

863
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:24,960
curly or or wrinkly for a while or they

864
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:28,289
can turn white from from iron chlorosis

865
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:30,349
and I'm also going with you know I'm

866
00:35:28,289 --> 00:35:33,440
going with this VPD program

867
00:35:30,349 --> 00:35:35,059
and you know the the levels that fluence

868
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,659
recommends they're really they're really

869
00:35:35,059 --> 00:35:39,979
helpful and that they they recommend

870
00:35:37,659 --> 00:35:44,268
temperatures and humidity x' and co2

871
00:35:39,978 --> 00:35:45,818
levels and light levels and pbft so you

872
00:35:44,268 --> 00:35:49,488
know how to optimize the environment

873
00:35:45,818 --> 00:35:52,338
like for example if you're not using

874
00:35:49,489 --> 00:35:57,798
supplemental co2 then there's really no

875
00:35:52,338 --> 00:36:00,528
reason to use more than 500 ppfd if you

876
00:35:57,798 --> 00:36:02,719
have more than 500 ppfd of light then

877
00:36:00,528 --> 00:36:04,670
it's just not going to be utilized or

878
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:07,578
it's going to stress the plant out if

879
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:10,849
there is supplemental co2 then it's

880
00:36:07,579 --> 00:36:12,950
possible to go up to a thousand ppfd or

881
00:36:10,849 --> 00:36:14,298
possibly higher do you have a light

882
00:36:12,949 --> 00:36:16,548
meter that you like for people who don't

883
00:36:14,298 --> 00:36:19,278
have one yeah you know the sunlight

884
00:36:16,548 --> 00:36:21,768
what's it called Sun system par meter

885
00:36:19,278 --> 00:36:23,478
get the one with the remote sensor so

886
00:36:21,768 --> 00:36:25,939
you don't have to stare at an instrument

887
00:36:23,478 --> 00:36:28,608
being held under a bright light but

888
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:31,249
they're rebranded Apogee which is a

889
00:36:28,608 --> 00:36:33,288
power meter that fishtank people like

890
00:36:31,248 --> 00:36:34,968
and I think it's even cheaper than the

891
00:36:33,289 --> 00:36:36,910
Apogee and it's even got that it's got

892
00:36:34,969 --> 00:36:39,889
the exact same sensor on it

893
00:36:36,909 --> 00:36:42,440
so yeah Sun system power meter with

894
00:36:39,889 --> 00:36:44,389
remote sensor okay I'll put a link to it

895
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:46,400
on our website so people can find it if

896
00:36:44,389 --> 00:36:48,588
they want to order one yeah and you find

897
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:50,989
it to be a really useful tool and your

898
00:36:48,588 --> 00:36:52,338
in your experience with you know going

899
00:36:50,989 --> 00:36:54,170
around and seeing these gardens and

900
00:36:52,338 --> 00:36:56,960
things like that I think it's crucial

901
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:58,999
because you could take a gig I you know

902
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:01,849
pretty good stab at what light level is

903
00:36:58,998 --> 00:37:03,709
but you don't really know and you know

904
00:37:01,849 --> 00:37:05,028
because you have pupils to get bigger

905
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:06,619
and smaller and so it's really hard to

906
00:37:05,028 --> 00:37:09,139
gauge subtle differences in light

907
00:37:06,619 --> 00:37:11,778
intensity and you just have different

908
00:37:09,139 --> 00:37:13,848
needs for cuttings versus young

909
00:37:11,778 --> 00:37:16,728
vegetative plants versus mature plants

910
00:37:13,849 --> 00:37:19,039
versus flowering plants with all the

911
00:37:16,728 --> 00:37:21,199
environmental levels it's it's best to

912
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:24,380
transition them slowly they slowly

913
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:27,018
increase light with co2 so that brings

914
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:30,739
up an interesting thing for me in terms

915
00:37:27,018 --> 00:37:33,828
of what tools do I think every grower

916
00:37:30,739 --> 00:37:34,940
should have in a garden so when I go out

917
00:37:33,829 --> 00:37:37,190
on a consult there are certain things

918
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:38,929
that I like to have in my bag because I

919
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:40,159
know I'm going to want to use them in

920
00:37:38,929 --> 00:37:42,318
the garden I think every grower should

921
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:43,319
have it so jeweler's loupe would be the

922
00:37:42,318 --> 00:37:45,900
first thing I

923
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:47,640
suggest so you can look closer at the

924
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:50,190
plant look for bugs things like that

925
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:54,750
let's see what else I have an iPhone

926
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:57,720
which allows me to take pictures so I'm

927
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:59,639
talking about at you know legal 502

928
00:37:57,719 --> 00:38:00,750
grows where they're allowed to have

929
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:03,569
plants there so I have to worry about

930
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:05,849
any location data or problems like that

931
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:08,130
with my photos but actually in notes

932
00:38:05,849 --> 00:38:09,960
which is an app on my phone I can take a

933
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:11,730
picture and then I can write notes below

934
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:13,349
I did have a date and know exactly what

935
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:16,320
I took that photo so I can go back and

936
00:38:13,349 --> 00:38:18,269
visually verify what I'm finding as well

937
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:21,030
as take notes on that image which I find

938
00:38:18,269 --> 00:38:23,489
really really handy Nelson talked about

939
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:26,310
that infrared thermometer so you can

940
00:38:23,489 --> 00:38:28,919
measure the temperature at the leaf

941
00:38:26,309 --> 00:38:31,199
surface right at the height of the

942
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:32,400
canopy which i think is another really

943
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:34,710
important tool and now we're talking

944
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:37,079
about light meters as one more thing

945
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:38,760
that every grower should have access to

946
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:41,429
is there anything else that you would

947
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:44,310
add to that list you need a microscope

948
00:38:41,429 --> 00:38:46,679
strong enough to find a broad light with

949
00:38:44,309 --> 00:38:48,960
you can find them with cheaper USB

950
00:38:46,679 --> 00:38:49,949
microscopes and I'm sure I've seen broad

951
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,840
buy it senator eken fifty dollar

952
00:38:49,949 --> 00:38:53,849
microscope but they're the one hundred

953
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:55,079
and thirty dollar ones are way nicer and

954
00:38:53,849 --> 00:38:58,769
the three hundred dollar ones are way

955
00:38:55,079 --> 00:39:01,860
nicer if you get into a Dynalite USB

956
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:04,800
scope I usually use my compost tea scope

957
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:07,170
I think a bench top microscope because I

958
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,760
have that for tea and so it keeps you

959
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:10,619
from needing to buy another microscope

960
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:11,940
now but when you're looking for broad

961
00:39:10,619 --> 00:39:14,250
mites with that sort of scope it's

962
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:17,519
helpful to use the light from below and

963
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:19,889
use a light from above and alternate

964
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:21,599
between those two to find ones hiding on

965
00:39:19,889 --> 00:39:22,889
the top or bottom of the leaf yeah I

966
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:25,230
remember you showed up at the farm a

967
00:39:22,889 --> 00:39:28,139
couple years ago with some leaves that

968
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:30,090
you said had broad mites and I didn't

969
00:39:28,139 --> 00:39:33,150
believe you and we got out my fancy

970
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:35,370
microscope and was shining the light

971
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:37,260
from above and it took probably oh I

972
00:39:35,369 --> 00:39:40,710
want to say 10 15 minutes to actually

973
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:42,060
find the mite on the leaf just because

974
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:44,880
they are so small and hard to identify

975
00:39:42,059 --> 00:39:46,590
and then we tried sampling a bunch of

976
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:48,869
stuff we had right there in the shop on

977
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:50,850
in terms of how it affected or killed

978
00:39:48,869 --> 00:39:53,309
the mite and I was amazed at how

979
00:39:50,849 --> 00:39:55,259
resilient those things were mm-hmm you

980
00:39:53,309 --> 00:39:56,449
really you really surprised me that day

981
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:57,650
with just

982
00:39:56,449 --> 00:39:59,389
tough the mites were in the fact that

983
00:39:57,650 --> 00:40:00,980
you know when you look at that leaf you

984
00:39:59,389 --> 00:40:03,859
wouldn't think there were mites on it

985
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:05,269
and it just looked like a new nutrient

986
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:08,900
deficiency or some sort of environmental

987
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:10,369
stress yeah it is still it still does

988
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:12,380
you know there's lots of things that

989
00:40:10,369 --> 00:40:14,420
look like broad mites but it's it's just

990
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:16,369
it's an important thing to have a tool

991
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:19,070
to scope for cuz if you can't rule that

992
00:40:16,369 --> 00:40:20,659
out then you're in trouble

993
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:22,370
you know if you if you can rule that out

994
00:40:20,659 --> 00:40:24,079
you know you don't spray spray spray

995
00:40:22,369 --> 00:40:25,519
disease these plants that probably just

996
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:27,380
have a nutrient problem or an

997
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:29,659
environment problem but if you're

998
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:31,070
chasing after if you're if you're just

999
00:40:29,659 --> 00:40:33,319
doing an occasional preventative

1000
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:34,910
spraying or some bio controls and you

1001
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:37,610
don't realize that you're managing a

1002
00:40:34,909 --> 00:40:39,579
small population of Rodd mites that can

1003
00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:41,630
that can be a huge problem it can

1004
00:40:39,579 --> 00:40:43,579
drastically lower your leaves for a lot

1005
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:45,230
for quite a long time like when we were

1006
00:40:43,579 --> 00:40:48,019
looking for the brown whites and we're

1007
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:50,090
seeing like two or maybe what it was

1008
00:40:48,019 --> 00:40:52,579
like three per leaf you know there's

1009
00:40:50,090 --> 00:40:54,470
five leaflets on a cannabis leaf and

1010
00:40:52,579 --> 00:40:56,989
we're seeing it at three per leaf is all

1011
00:40:54,469 --> 00:40:59,779
we can find and that's enough to cause

1012
00:40:56,989 --> 00:41:03,019
the leaves to claw up and start to get

1013
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:05,330
the intervene on the kosis and the pail

1014
00:41:03,019 --> 00:41:07,309
new growth peep a lot of people manage

1015
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:09,469
broad mites at a low population and

1016
00:41:07,309 --> 00:41:12,469
don't realize it and think they have a

1017
00:41:09,469 --> 00:41:15,159
virus and they don't so what we're

1018
00:41:12,469 --> 00:41:18,019
looking for there is sort of a lighter

1019
00:41:15,159 --> 00:41:20,389
twisted new green growth assuming it's

1020
00:41:18,019 --> 00:41:24,619
not the genetics of that cultivar that's

1021
00:41:20,389 --> 00:41:28,819
known yeah it's it's one I would usually

1022
00:41:24,619 --> 00:41:32,029
see pale new growth and flying or

1023
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:35,390
twisting or contorting of the leaf slits

1024
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:37,880
or I'm if you're in flower the tips of

1025
00:41:35,389 --> 00:41:39,429
the pistils start to go Brown or lots of

1026
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:41,660
the pistils go all the way Brown

1027
00:41:39,429 --> 00:41:44,239
prematurely plants that just stopped

1028
00:41:41,659 --> 00:41:46,670
growing and look the same that's that's

1029
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:48,500
a definite broad net symptom that's a

1030
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:49,970
really good point that you brought up

1031
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:53,059
that the plant really does just stop

1032
00:41:49,969 --> 00:41:57,139
growing and not to change subjects but

1033
00:41:53,059 --> 00:42:00,949
that reminded me of the the one that the

1034
00:41:57,139 --> 00:42:04,819
other problem with the nematode that you

1035
00:42:00,949 --> 00:42:06,649
guys showed your nemesis I guess we

1036
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:07,970
could say in some ways too

1037
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:10,280
can you talk a little bit about that

1038
00:42:07,969 --> 00:42:13,179
didn't image so we got a

1039
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:16,840
root-knot nematode and it is the only

1040
00:42:13,179 --> 00:42:20,089
pest it's the only thing that's required

1041
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:23,480
soil to be replaced after years of

1042
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:26,090
reusing the soil the nematode builds up

1043
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:28,670
in populations crop after crop until the

1044
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:30,380
yields are just horrible if if this

1045
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:32,450
usually there's like soil that comes out

1046
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:35,210
of the flowering beds and gets reused

1047
00:42:32,449 --> 00:42:39,139
for veg plants but if it goes if it is

1048
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:40,519
recycled that way in veg the plants just

1049
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:43,849
turn into duds

1050
00:42:40,519 --> 00:42:47,239
they will wilt quickly they'll get

1051
00:42:43,849 --> 00:42:50,869
deficiency symptoms like intervene old

1052
00:42:47,239 --> 00:42:54,799
chlorosis and the tell-tale sign is the

1053
00:42:50,869 --> 00:42:56,480
nodules on the roots so if plants go if

1054
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:58,130
plants are grown and slow with no no

1055
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,949
meat oats in it and they grow go into

1056
00:42:58,130 --> 00:43:05,000
beds or pots or the field whatever with

1057
00:43:00,949 --> 00:43:08,739
nematodes they'll still finish but it's

1058
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:10,849
drastically decreased in the yield so we

1059
00:43:08,739 --> 00:43:14,709
run a running trouser these different

1060
00:43:10,849 --> 00:43:16,730
organic Nebat asides like mellow con and

1061
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:21,019
there's all these bacterial or fungal

1062
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:23,889
products and there's also a key AHA

1063
00:43:21,019 --> 00:43:26,809
saponaria product that we're trying and

1064
00:43:23,889 --> 00:43:29,210
they seem to help we need to do more

1065
00:43:26,809 --> 00:43:32,389
controls so we can see exactly how much

1066
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:34,820
it's helping because I know one person

1067
00:43:32,389 --> 00:43:36,379
who brought all the sold out of the out

1068
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:39,019
of the place cleaned everything up to

1069
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:41,769
the best of their ability and somehow

1070
00:43:39,019 --> 00:43:46,099
the nematode survived yeah I had gotten

1071
00:43:41,769 --> 00:43:48,369
some clones from that person and uh I

1072
00:43:46,099 --> 00:43:50,869
was just gonna grow them out for a

1073
00:43:48,369 --> 00:43:53,150
cloning trial I wanted to run had like

1074
00:43:50,869 --> 00:43:55,460
six plants I think it was and they were

1075
00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:59,119
all in 4-inch so I up public many

1076
00:43:55,460 --> 00:44:02,360
gallons in our biochar soil and had him

1077
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:04,099
under a t5 just in a corner and you know

1078
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:08,480
I I wasn't giving them particular

1079
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:12,139
attention and they never looked nice

1080
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:14,480
I had must have had them there for a

1081
00:44:12,139 --> 00:44:17,599
month and a half and they probably grew

1082
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:19,070
another inch in that entire time we know

1083
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:20,509
that was watering I'm I was caring for

1084
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:22,840
him I even tried adding nutrients I was

1085
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:24,520
like what is what's going on

1086
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:25,630
and it got to the point where I was like

1087
00:44:24,519 --> 00:44:29,259
I'm never gonna be able to clone these

1088
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:30,579
plants and I thought it was the soil I

1089
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:33,400
thought it was well I guess it was a

1090
00:44:30,579 --> 00:44:35,500
soil but I thought it was my soil or

1091
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:38,530
something going on with Mike care for

1092
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:40,420
the plants and I took him out to throw

1093
00:44:38,530 --> 00:44:43,300
him away and when I pulled the plant out

1094
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:45,970
of the out of the pot I was shocked to

1095
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:47,680
see these giant they look like knots in

1096
00:44:45,969 --> 00:44:50,379
their roots and all I'll post those

1097
00:44:47,679 --> 00:44:53,199
photos on this podcast page so people

1098
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:55,180
can see what we're talking about and at

1099
00:44:53,199 --> 00:44:56,799
that point cuz I knew at that point that

1100
00:44:55,179 --> 00:44:58,929
this grower had been dealing with this

1101
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:00,700
problem but he thought these plants were

1102
00:44:58,929 --> 00:45:01,839
clean and I'd been so busy with other

1103
00:45:00,699 --> 00:45:03,639
things that I was literally just

1104
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:06,070
watering him and not giving them a lot

1105
00:45:03,639 --> 00:45:08,710
more attention or my time so I was

1106
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:12,850
shocked to see just how devastating this

1107
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:15,340
nematode really could be to to a garden

1108
00:45:12,849 --> 00:45:20,079
or to cannabis yeah and nematodes

1109
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:22,090
there's multiple kinds of of parasitic

1110
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:24,099
nematodes plant feeding nematodes

1111
00:45:22,090 --> 00:45:25,780
but this root-knot nematode is the one

1112
00:45:24,099 --> 00:45:28,329
that makes these nodules so it's

1113
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:29,890
relatively easy to identify and it

1114
00:45:28,329 --> 00:45:31,929
doesn't live in the soil very long

1115
00:45:29,889 --> 00:45:35,289
before it's in the root and once it's in

1116
00:45:31,929 --> 00:45:39,579
there it's there's nothing to predate it

1117
00:45:35,289 --> 00:45:42,070
so it's important to use these number

1118
00:45:39,579 --> 00:45:45,219
two Seidel products right before

1119
00:45:42,070 --> 00:45:47,710
transplant and water and ideally water

1120
00:45:45,219 --> 00:45:51,250
into the soil a week or two prior and

1121
00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:54,639
watered in at transplant and then at

1122
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:56,590
whatever interval it recommends but also

1123
00:45:54,639 --> 00:46:00,429
things like mycorrhizal fungal

1124
00:45:56,590 --> 00:46:03,210
colonization decreases how pathogenic

1125
00:46:00,429 --> 00:46:05,289
these nematodes are and Trichoderma

1126
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:07,679
good tracker drummer levels in the soil

1127
00:46:05,289 --> 00:46:10,389
or in the rhizosphere decrease nematodes

1128
00:46:07,679 --> 00:46:13,210
there's university research on worm

1129
00:46:10,389 --> 00:46:16,269
casting tea or worm casting extract

1130
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:17,949
really helping out a lot and lots of

1131
00:46:16,269 --> 00:46:20,019
different bacterial products that you

1132
00:46:17,949 --> 00:46:22,149
can you can buy and we know a lot of

1133
00:46:20,019 --> 00:46:24,960
these bacteria or fungi are in the soil

1134
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:28,539
so it's not necessarily that we need

1135
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:31,449
crazy amounts or crazy populations of

1136
00:46:28,539 --> 00:46:33,159
these we just need them in there so if

1137
00:46:31,449 --> 00:46:35,679
we can get all this if we can make sure

1138
00:46:33,159 --> 00:46:36,399
we get the max biological diversity from

1139
00:46:35,679 --> 00:46:39,069
the

1140
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:42,340
poster castings or products early on

1141
00:46:39,070 --> 00:46:43,840
that will safeguard the crop so again

1142
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:46,269
this just idea of creating an optimal

1143
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:47,800
environment or healthier environment for

1144
00:46:46,269 --> 00:46:49,869
the plant will help it protect itself

1145
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:52,030
mm-hmm or fight off some of these things

1146
00:46:49,869 --> 00:46:53,980
a little bit better obvious not gonna

1147
00:46:52,030 --> 00:46:56,019
keep the nematode from infecting the

1148
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:59,440
plant and and I want to mention I've

1149
00:46:56,019 --> 00:47:01,119
seen people call them duds these plants

1150
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:02,619
that just get they could they stop

1151
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:03,940
growing or they looked at fishing they

1152
00:47:02,619 --> 00:47:05,619
look sick like they have a root rot or

1153
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:08,170
something and I've seen these plants

1154
00:47:05,619 --> 00:47:10,059
before in mini Gardens occasionally and

1155
00:47:08,170 --> 00:47:12,610
I always look at the roots and I've seen

1156
00:47:10,059 --> 00:47:15,309
root nodules before and so that soil

1157
00:47:12,610 --> 00:47:17,980
leaves the leaves of facility because I

1158
00:47:15,309 --> 00:47:20,380
know it could be a nematode but it's

1159
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:22,360
never gotten out of control and I've

1160
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:23,530
seen this for years occasionally and now

1161
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:25,090
there's just nematode which is out of

1162
00:47:23,530 --> 00:47:27,550
control so I don't know if it's a

1163
00:47:25,090 --> 00:47:31,240
different nematode or if we just are

1164
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:35,080
lacking some biological diversity in the

1165
00:47:31,239 --> 00:47:38,079
soil we had before but I'll keep you

1166
00:47:35,079 --> 00:47:40,449
updated okay that sounds great so let's

1167
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:41,650
change subjects again I want to talk a

1168
00:47:40,449 --> 00:47:44,319
little about your experience with

1169
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:45,550
reusing soil so this is something that I

1170
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:48,190
know you've worked with a lot of

1171
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:49,600
different people on and you've worked

1172
00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:52,480
with growers that have literally kept

1173
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:55,059
the same soil in their gardens for you

1174
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:57,639
know up to five years so can you talk a

1175
00:47:55,059 --> 00:47:59,920
little bit more about that process what

1176
00:47:57,639 --> 00:48:02,409
you're bringing the soil into beds what

1177
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:05,110
what else is going on there like the

1178
00:48:02,409 --> 00:48:07,089
Rhea mending their amending rate or like

1179
00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:08,620
the process of it let's just go through

1180
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:10,210
the whole process really quickly so you

1181
00:48:08,619 --> 00:48:13,119
bring let's say let's just start with a

1182
00:48:10,210 --> 00:48:16,360
room you have two thousand watt lights

1183
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:18,609
or you can talk about what sort of other

1184
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:21,400
LED lights would cover that space on a

1185
00:48:18,610 --> 00:48:23,470
four by eight bed with approximately a

1186
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:24,789
yard of soil can you talk about what

1187
00:48:23,469 --> 00:48:27,459
size the plants are when you bring them

1188
00:48:24,789 --> 00:48:29,139
in how many plants you're scrubbing them

1189
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:30,610
I happen to know that because I've seen

1190
00:48:29,139 --> 00:48:32,349
some of these setups can you talk a

1191
00:48:30,610 --> 00:48:33,340
little more about just the process I

1192
00:48:32,349 --> 00:48:36,699
guess for people who aren't familiar

1193
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:39,910
with it so a four byte bed holds right

1194
00:48:36,699 --> 00:48:43,960
about a yard and when that soil is

1195
00:48:39,909 --> 00:48:46,719
reused it it needs about ten pounds of

1196
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:49,059
it for using his nutrient pack it takes

1197
00:48:46,719 --> 00:48:50,079
about ten pounds thirteen seven and

1198
00:48:49,059 --> 00:48:52,599
fourteen depends

1199
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:57,369
the yield is a nectarine and the soil

1200
00:48:52,599 --> 00:49:00,730
and that rate can be used for dozens of

1201
00:48:57,369 --> 00:49:02,380
crop cycles and if you are using some

1202
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:04,929
other nutrient blend it's similar you

1203
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:07,599
know similar NPK it's you shot a dial in

1204
00:49:04,929 --> 00:49:09,219
you know if you do soil test in between

1205
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:10,929
each crop you can see if you're getting

1206
00:49:09,219 --> 00:49:12,519
a build-up for a deficiency of a certain

1207
00:49:10,929 --> 00:49:15,549
soil mineral and you can tweak the

1208
00:49:12,519 --> 00:49:18,489
recipe but I think that's what you did

1209
00:49:15,550 --> 00:49:21,760
with with so tests over the course of a

1210
00:49:18,489 --> 00:49:24,219
couple years to get the ratios right so

1211
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:27,430
we can just use the same nutrient blend

1212
00:49:24,219 --> 00:49:30,699
each crop cycle but the procedure is

1213
00:49:27,429 --> 00:49:32,919
after harvesting we just pull the stumps

1214
00:49:30,699 --> 00:49:36,639
out of the soil leave as much fruit as

1215
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:39,400
possible and then till the dry nutrients

1216
00:49:36,639 --> 00:49:42,609
end at the top half maybe the top four

1217
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:44,889
to six inches of the soil just to make

1218
00:49:42,610 --> 00:49:47,260
sure it's incorporated into the soil if

1219
00:49:44,889 --> 00:49:51,369
we if you till all the way to the bottom

1220
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:53,860
it doesn't help and it might hurt but

1221
00:49:51,369 --> 00:49:55,420
you need to get it into the you know get

1222
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:57,910
at least four four six inches deep

1223
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:59,619
because it needs to stay moist if the

1224
00:49:57,909 --> 00:50:01,119
top of the soil is always drying out and

1225
00:49:59,619 --> 00:50:02,799
the roots are predominating in the

1226
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:04,960
bottom half of this soil then they're

1227
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:06,550
just not making contact of those

1228
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:08,559
nutrients you're not getting worms up

1229
00:50:06,550 --> 00:50:11,350
there to move them around the soil so

1230
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:14,409
you know incorporating or a little bit

1231
00:50:11,349 --> 00:50:17,319
of tilling is desirable and then after

1232
00:50:14,409 --> 00:50:19,690
that's done we we plant back into it the

1233
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:21,280
following day you Defamation traveling

1234
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:22,750
beds are great for trellising I think

1235
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:26,500
whether people grow indoors or outdoors

1236
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:29,739
it's the most labor efficient way to

1237
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:31,809
train plants and you can use multiple

1238
00:50:29,739 --> 00:50:33,519
level what I mean by that is horizontal

1239
00:50:31,809 --> 00:50:38,469
trellising and you can use multiple

1240
00:50:33,519 --> 00:50:40,239
layers too just to make it make it quick

1241
00:50:38,469 --> 00:50:42,489
and make it so the plants are always

1242
00:50:40,239 --> 00:50:43,989
supported when they get mature and heavy

1243
00:50:42,489 --> 00:50:45,819
so they don't start laying on top of

1244
00:50:43,989 --> 00:50:47,349
each other so similar to what nelson was

1245
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:51,519
talking about in terms of training the

1246
00:50:47,349 --> 00:50:53,259
plants and yeah optimizing your canopy I

1247
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:56,920
think Nelson has very similar style and

1248
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:58,780
then plant count is up to its it's up to

1249
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:01,240
your pure regulation first if your

1250
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:02,769
medical grow you're limited to lower

1251
00:51:01,239 --> 00:51:03,789
plant counts and you want to cover a

1252
00:51:02,769 --> 00:51:06,309
certain square footage

1253
00:51:03,789 --> 00:51:08,650
then that determines how many plants you

1254
00:51:06,309 --> 00:51:10,480
have per square foot and the benefit of

1255
00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:12,730
growing more plants is you don't spend

1256
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:14,650
as much time edging the plant because

1257
00:51:12,730 --> 00:51:18,010
that takes energy and it takes nutrients

1258
00:51:14,650 --> 00:51:20,889
so it's easier to grow more plants so

1259
00:51:18,010 --> 00:51:22,900
for recreational farmers see a green is

1260
00:51:20,889 --> 00:51:24,789
the most what we call Co green it's the

1261
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:28,000
most efficient way to grow where people

1262
00:51:24,789 --> 00:51:30,190
have around one plant per square foot so

1263
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,469
the veg time is really brief so really

1264
00:51:30,190 --> 00:51:35,050
our yield is is most related to our

1265
00:51:32,469 --> 00:51:38,439
canopy so if we can build that canopy

1266
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:42,430
using four plants or eight plants in a

1267
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:44,440
yard of soil faster then we're going to

1268
00:51:42,429 --> 00:51:47,009
maximize our yield because we can

1269
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:50,650
increase our crop cycle yeah definitely

1270
00:51:47,010 --> 00:51:51,610
we can get per per year out of that out

1271
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:53,289
of that soil yep

1272
00:51:51,610 --> 00:51:55,510
whether there's one square foot per

1273
00:51:53,289 --> 00:51:58,449
plant or ten square feet per plant it

1274
00:51:55,510 --> 00:52:00,070
should yield exactly the same but if

1275
00:51:58,449 --> 00:52:03,579
you're doing multiple crops per year

1276
00:52:00,070 --> 00:52:05,950
then smaller plants more crop cycles per

1277
00:52:03,579 --> 00:52:08,199
year and one thing I want to touch on is

1278
00:52:05,949 --> 00:52:10,389
the way you describe is not the only way

1279
00:52:08,199 --> 00:52:14,649
to do it I know gold leaf has gone to

1280
00:52:10,389 --> 00:52:16,719
amending at a little bit lighter levels

1281
00:52:14,650 --> 00:52:19,119
initially and then they'll top dress

1282
00:52:16,719 --> 00:52:21,009
with the nutrient pack or you know

1283
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:23,339
whatever amendments you want to use a

1284
00:52:21,010 --> 00:52:25,600
little bit later on into flower you know

1285
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:26,740
say at the end of the first week of

1286
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:28,449
flower in the end of the third week of

1287
00:52:26,739 --> 00:52:30,429
flower they'll put a light top dressing

1288
00:52:28,449 --> 00:52:31,869
of nutrients on there as a way to get

1289
00:52:30,429 --> 00:52:34,480
more nutrients in the soil without

1290
00:52:31,869 --> 00:52:36,579
risking that soil heating up mm-hmm

1291
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:40,510
yeah we feel if you've got large volumes

1292
00:52:36,579 --> 00:52:43,090
of soil in beds or if you have like 100

1293
00:52:40,510 --> 00:52:45,100
gallon pots 200 gallon pots then you

1294
00:52:43,090 --> 00:52:46,900
that's ok heat up if you meant it really

1295
00:52:45,099 --> 00:52:48,400
heavily and there's benefits to top

1296
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:50,260
dressing to spreading out the nutrient

1297
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:51,670
application through the throughout the

1298
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:53,920
growing season rather than just once

1299
00:52:51,670 --> 00:52:55,659
it's a lot you know putting all of your

1300
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:59,829
nitrogen in for the entire crop cycle at

1301
00:52:55,659 --> 00:53:01,929
once is not necessarily optimal but if

1302
00:52:59,829 --> 00:53:04,029
you can get away with it then it saves

1303
00:53:01,929 --> 00:53:06,669
the labor of topdressing later on so

1304
00:53:04,030 --> 00:53:08,140
your vegging in another space this would

1305
00:53:06,670 --> 00:53:08,889
be your flower room that we're talking

1306
00:53:08,139 --> 00:53:11,710
about right now

1307
00:53:08,889 --> 00:53:14,559
correct yeah yeah the idea is to always

1308
00:53:11,710 --> 00:53:15,579
have the flower room in flower that's

1309
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:17,409
let's say the flower room is always

1310
00:53:15,579 --> 00:53:20,380
always has 12 hours of light

1311
00:53:17,409 --> 00:53:23,649
and you want to turn as many crops per

1312
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:26,170
year in that flowering space so you want

1313
00:53:23,650 --> 00:53:28,000
a veg room that's half that size or a

1314
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:30,220
third of that size to provide enough

1315
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,539
plants that cover enough square feet

1316
00:53:30,219 --> 00:53:34,869
that you can move them into the flower

1317
00:53:31,539 --> 00:53:37,389
room and click them over immediately I

1318
00:53:34,869 --> 00:53:41,139
like to give it a few days to a week to

1319
00:53:37,389 --> 00:53:46,569
transition if possible or if is it

1320
00:53:41,139 --> 00:53:49,690
possible to I guess maintain the same

1321
00:53:46,570 --> 00:53:50,680
temperature and humidity levels but is

1322
00:53:49,690 --> 00:53:52,389
there anything we're doing with a light

1323
00:53:50,679 --> 00:53:54,789
level there in terms of that transition

1324
00:53:52,389 --> 00:53:58,389
that's the trick if you can go from veg

1325
00:53:54,789 --> 00:53:59,829
to flower and and immediately we go from

1326
00:53:58,389 --> 00:54:01,659
the bedroom to the flower room and that

1327
00:53:59,829 --> 00:54:03,699
plant goes into flower that day that's

1328
00:54:01,659 --> 00:54:06,069
ideal because you get more more turns

1329
00:54:03,699 --> 00:54:07,989
per year more crop cycles per year but

1330
00:54:06,070 --> 00:54:08,470
you have to match the environment pretty

1331
00:54:07,989 --> 00:54:11,109
closely

1332
00:54:08,469 --> 00:54:14,769
which means similar temperatures similar

1333
00:54:11,110 --> 00:54:17,230
humidity similar light level similar co2

1334
00:54:14,769 --> 00:54:19,030
level I've found that similar co2 level

1335
00:54:17,230 --> 00:54:21,519
isn't as important going from

1336
00:54:19,030 --> 00:54:23,050
atmospheric levels to elevated I've

1337
00:54:21,519 --> 00:54:25,719
haven't seen it caught as a problem but

1338
00:54:23,050 --> 00:54:27,820
I could be wrong but temperature light

1339
00:54:25,719 --> 00:54:30,009
levels humidity that's really important

1340
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:31,870
so what does your optimal flower room

1341
00:54:30,010 --> 00:54:34,600
look like I know you just helped set one

1342
00:54:31,869 --> 00:54:36,159
up the other day what what sort of

1343
00:54:34,599 --> 00:54:38,049
equipment are using um can you describe

1344
00:54:36,159 --> 00:54:40,029
that a little bit more the new optimal

1345
00:54:38,050 --> 00:54:43,930
flower room is the one I just the one I

1346
00:54:40,030 --> 00:54:46,570
just did with the fluence vipers they

1347
00:54:43,929 --> 00:54:48,250
are five hundred and fifty five hundred

1348
00:54:46,570 --> 00:54:50,769
and fifteen watt lights that cover a

1349
00:54:48,250 --> 00:54:55,769
three by four area you know running at

1350
00:54:50,769 --> 00:55:00,039
around 82 to 84 degrees 1500 ppm co2

1351
00:54:55,769 --> 00:55:01,780
around 75% humidity I of course like

1352
00:55:00,039 --> 00:55:04,360
beds but you could get away with a

1353
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:05,830
little less soil per square foot what is

1354
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:08,740
it rather than a yard covering up four

1355
00:55:05,829 --> 00:55:09,909
by eight you could do 2/3 that and you'd

1356
00:55:08,739 --> 00:55:12,309
probably find yeah I'm sure you'd be

1357
00:55:09,909 --> 00:55:15,489
fine as long as you could keep it

1358
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:17,289
irrigated and I recommend most people

1359
00:55:15,489 --> 00:55:19,119
use troughs we met irrigation because

1360
00:55:17,289 --> 00:55:22,599
it's it works really well it's it's

1361
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:24,969
really easy it's it's totally mechanical

1362
00:55:22,599 --> 00:55:26,409
automatic irrigation sure let's talk

1363
00:55:24,969 --> 00:55:28,629
about that a little bit we haven't

1364
00:55:26,409 --> 00:55:29,210
talked about blue mats really on on this

1365
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:30,829
podcast

1366
00:55:29,210 --> 00:55:32,090
for people and I know you have a lot of

1367
00:55:30,829 --> 00:55:35,000
experience with them so can you describe

1368
00:55:32,090 --> 00:55:37,880
what blue mats are how they work how you

1369
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:39,980
set them up in a garden so a blue mat

1370
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:45,010
it's a company called trough blue mat

1371
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:49,039
which is spelled the TR o PF b lu ma t

1372
00:55:45,010 --> 00:55:51,620
they're an Austrian company right yes

1373
00:55:49,039 --> 00:55:52,219
and for German yeah they're out of

1374
00:55:51,619 --> 00:55:54,139
Austria

1375
00:55:52,219 --> 00:55:56,389
yeah Austrian company made an Austria

1376
00:55:54,139 --> 00:55:58,699
stuff and it's a it's a tensiometer

1377
00:55:56,389 --> 00:56:00,319
which means it measures the stool

1378
00:55:58,699 --> 00:56:03,919
attention measures the moisture content

1379
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:05,990
of the soil and it's a small cylinder

1380
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:09,200
that holds water and it has a ceramic

1381
00:56:05,989 --> 00:56:11,089
tip so as the soil dries out it flows a

1382
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:14,239
little bit of water out of that cylinder

1383
00:56:11,090 --> 00:56:15,890
and it turns on the irrigation so

1384
00:56:14,239 --> 00:56:17,569
there's moisture sensors that have a

1385
00:56:15,889 --> 00:56:18,829
little readout you push a button I'll

1386
00:56:17,570 --> 00:56:20,750
tell you the moisture content of the

1387
00:56:18,829 --> 00:56:23,210
soil and they're really affordable and

1388
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:26,599
very accurate and the actual top blue

1389
00:56:23,210 --> 00:56:28,570
mats open a little valve to run the

1390
00:56:26,599 --> 00:56:32,000
water through drippers or through a

1391
00:56:28,570 --> 00:56:33,710
soaker hose and so they they just run

1392
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,929
off of water pressure so it's all

1393
00:56:33,710 --> 00:56:38,179
mechanical there's no electricity being

1394
00:56:35,929 --> 00:56:40,669
used and you can either run it right off

1395
00:56:38,179 --> 00:56:43,940
of a main line like plumbing or you can

1396
00:56:40,670 --> 00:56:45,950
run it off of a reservoir off of water

1397
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:47,570
pressure like you mentioned yep yeah if

1398
00:56:45,949 --> 00:56:49,489
you do the math you can do it you can

1399
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:51,530
run it on gravity if you want to elevate

1400
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:54,199
a tank it's really easy to grow off go

1401
00:56:51,530 --> 00:56:56,030
off with a bum off the tap or if you

1402
00:56:54,199 --> 00:56:57,500
want to pull out of a reservoir if you

1403
00:56:56,030 --> 00:56:59,510
want to add some soluble nutrients to

1404
00:56:57,500 --> 00:57:01,579
your lines then you can get a booster

1405
00:56:59,510 --> 00:57:03,200
pump they're they're pretty affordable

1406
00:57:01,579 --> 00:57:05,690
and I think blue mat salesmen

1407
00:57:03,199 --> 00:57:07,339
preassembled now they have these so

1408
00:57:05,690 --> 00:57:09,170
girls so it used to be where you had to

1409
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:12,170
have one blue mat and which would give

1410
00:57:09,170 --> 00:57:14,510
you one drip site and then more recently

1411
00:57:12,170 --> 00:57:16,280
when I say more recently I think in the

1412
00:57:14,510 --> 00:57:18,200
last 5-10 years they added these

1413
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:22,850
distribution drippers so you can have up

1414
00:57:18,199 --> 00:57:26,329
to five drippers per pleure carat or per

1415
00:57:22,849 --> 00:57:29,210
bloom at sensor and that really to me

1416
00:57:26,329 --> 00:57:31,279
was a game changer because you can't

1417
00:57:29,210 --> 00:57:33,260
have four or five carrots in a pod it

1418
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:36,230
just doesn't make any sense for one

1419
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:38,750
plant but if you can run one carrot with

1420
00:57:36,230 --> 00:57:40,969
five drip sites that completely encircle

1421
00:57:38,750 --> 00:57:43,188
the base of the plant

1422
00:57:40,969 --> 00:57:45,889
covering the root zone now it becomes a

1423
00:57:43,188 --> 00:57:48,228
little more affordable so I know I set

1424
00:57:45,889 --> 00:57:50,478
one up at my house with a 50 gallon

1425
00:57:48,228 --> 00:57:53,149
reservoir and I was able to handle all I

1426
00:57:50,478 --> 00:57:55,308
think I had 15 plants at the time and it

1427
00:57:53,150 --> 00:57:57,079
worked it worked really really well can

1428
00:57:55,309 --> 00:57:59,509
you talk a little bit more about how you

1429
00:57:57,079 --> 00:58:00,829
dial them in and and place them in the

1430
00:57:59,509 --> 00:58:02,329
pot itself

1431
00:58:00,829 --> 00:58:04,009
let's just talk containers for now let's

1432
00:58:02,329 --> 00:58:05,539
let's talk about a let's say a 10 gallon

1433
00:58:04,009 --> 00:58:07,699
container they don't have to hook up to

1434
00:58:05,539 --> 00:58:09,949
hook the bloom add up to a dripper but

1435
00:58:07,699 --> 00:58:12,019
they're around $7 six or seven dollars

1436
00:58:09,949 --> 00:58:14,389
for the bloom at which is the sensor and

1437
00:58:12,018 --> 00:58:16,669
it drips out right next to it but you

1438
00:58:14,389 --> 00:58:19,578
can hook up a chain of drippers they say

1439
00:58:16,670 --> 00:58:23,358
up to five which will cover about a 16

1440
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:26,599
by 24 inch area so you can do more than

1441
00:58:23,358 --> 00:58:29,778
five but it you get a bit of a bit of

1442
00:58:26,599 --> 00:58:31,910
loss down the chain as you go further

1443
00:58:29,778 --> 00:58:33,798
out but if you do them in a spiral if

1444
00:58:31,909 --> 00:58:36,018
you're doing a big pot you can do it you

1445
00:58:33,798 --> 00:58:39,099
can do ten drippers if you want but in a

1446
00:58:36,018 --> 00:58:40,909
ten gallon pot I'd probably do I

1447
00:58:39,099 --> 00:58:43,099
probably you could get away with just

1448
00:58:40,909 --> 00:58:45,348
one bloom out in five drippers if you

1449
00:58:43,099 --> 00:58:48,048
had a really deep pot then you might

1450
00:58:45,349 --> 00:58:50,568
want to do a there's a different bloom

1451
00:58:48,048 --> 00:58:53,208
at called maxi if you have deeper than

1452
00:58:50,568 --> 00:58:55,489
12 inches of soil you want to use a maxi

1453
00:58:53,208 --> 00:58:58,098
bloom at and a normal bloom at but I

1454
00:58:55,489 --> 00:59:01,039
really recommend people grow in a dish

1455
00:58:58,099 --> 00:59:03,170
or a shorter of wider container because

1456
00:59:01,039 --> 00:59:06,469
that's really the that's how cannabis

1457
00:59:03,170 --> 00:59:08,479
roots grow so in a three gallon pot

1458
00:59:06,469 --> 00:59:10,999
probably three dripper the seven gallon

1459
00:59:08,478 --> 00:59:13,038
pot five drippers 10 or 12 gallon pod

1460
00:59:10,998 --> 00:59:16,188
you could do two blue mats each with

1461
00:59:13,039 --> 00:59:19,039
three to five drippers it depends on how

1462
00:59:16,188 --> 00:59:21,739
much you want every inch of the surface

1463
00:59:19,039 --> 00:59:23,839
to be moist because if you dig down an

1464
00:59:21,739 --> 00:59:25,639
inch or inch and a half at that point

1465
00:59:23,838 --> 00:59:27,288
all the soil that's evenly moist and

1466
00:59:25,639 --> 00:59:30,139
this isn't potting so you know a

1467
00:59:27,289 --> 00:59:32,719
different story differently yeah I was a

1468
00:59:30,139 --> 00:59:35,568
little more OCD with my setup so in a

1469
00:59:32,719 --> 00:59:38,568
fifteen gallon pot I ran to bloom at

1470
00:59:35,568 --> 00:59:40,369
sensors just the regulars with four drip

1471
00:59:38,568 --> 00:59:42,949
sites on each side a trip points in

1472
00:59:40,369 --> 00:59:45,798
every container and I did I did have

1473
00:59:42,949 --> 00:59:50,869
some problems I know at one point I got

1474
00:59:45,798 --> 00:59:52,880
I flooded my room because I didn't have

1475
00:59:50,869 --> 00:59:53,990
one of the ones dialed in and it was

1476
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:56,150
just dripping and I didn't

1477
00:59:53,989 --> 00:59:58,219
realize it so I soaked a plant since

1478
00:59:56,150 --> 01:00:00,170
then I've learned that you can't bump

1479
00:59:58,219 --> 01:00:01,099
the mainline so you want to put it

1480
01:00:00,170 --> 01:00:03,530
somewhere where you're not gonna run

1481
01:00:01,099 --> 01:00:06,618
into it because if that sensor that's

1482
01:00:03,530 --> 01:00:08,840
pushed down into the soil loses contact

1483
01:00:06,619 --> 01:00:10,579
with the soil it'll just start dripping

1484
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:13,160
which is something that you taught me

1485
01:00:10,579 --> 01:00:14,599
and then also once you have them dialed

1486
01:00:13,159 --> 01:00:16,039
in you can pretty much just walk away

1487
01:00:14,599 --> 01:00:17,118
but you want to at least check on them

1488
01:00:16,039 --> 01:00:18,739
and make sure that everything is still

1489
01:00:17,119 --> 01:00:20,840
working correctly can you talk about

1490
01:00:18,739 --> 01:00:23,929
that dialing in process though how you

1491
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:27,110
how you dial in a sensor yeah it's so

1492
01:00:23,929 --> 01:00:29,329
when you first plant them into the soil

1493
01:00:27,110 --> 01:00:31,130
well first you soak the bloom at you

1494
01:00:29,329 --> 01:00:33,170
soak the bot you soak it under water for

1495
01:00:31,130 --> 01:00:35,930
these couple hours or so good overnight

1496
01:00:33,170 --> 01:00:38,030
and screw it together under water so

1497
01:00:35,929 --> 01:00:40,489
there's no air bubbles in there and then

1498
01:00:38,030 --> 01:00:44,150
when you plant them into the soil

1499
01:00:40,489 --> 01:00:47,149
you wanna water them in in numerous

1500
01:00:44,150 --> 01:00:48,619
quick passes and the idea is they're

1501
01:00:47,150 --> 01:00:51,050
only gonna stick about three inches into

1502
01:00:48,619 --> 01:00:54,440
the soil but you want this soil around

1503
01:00:51,050 --> 01:00:57,470
it to be saturated as saturated as that

1504
01:00:54,440 --> 01:01:00,409
so it gets so if your soul was overly

1505
01:00:57,469 --> 01:01:02,539
dry especially for using peat moss then

1506
01:01:00,409 --> 01:01:05,269
it takes you might not be able to get it

1507
01:01:02,539 --> 01:01:08,090
up to maximum saturation or field

1508
01:01:05,269 --> 01:01:10,369
capacity in over the course of an hour

1509
01:01:08,090 --> 01:01:12,320
or two you want to start with moist soil

1510
01:01:10,369 --> 01:01:14,000
and do these quick passes of water so

1511
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:16,730
you know the soils have filled capacity

1512
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:19,219
and that way we can calibrate the

1513
01:01:16,730 --> 01:01:20,000
drippers they're all calibrated to field

1514
01:01:19,219 --> 01:01:22,789
capacity

1515
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:24,889
so once the once the blue mats are

1516
01:01:22,789 --> 01:01:27,170
planted watered in all the souls that

1517
01:01:24,889 --> 01:01:30,139
field capacity then you open them up

1518
01:01:27,170 --> 01:01:32,869
until water comes out and close them

1519
01:01:30,139 --> 01:01:35,389
slowly until the water stops and at that

1520
01:01:32,869 --> 01:01:36,710
point it's essentially calibrated to

1521
01:01:35,389 --> 01:01:38,750
maintain the soil at that moisture

1522
01:01:36,710 --> 01:01:41,090
content but that's soaking wet so you

1523
01:01:38,750 --> 01:01:44,358
don't want that so you turn the screw

1524
01:01:41,090 --> 01:01:46,730
two turns and a turn is a the space

1525
01:01:44,358 --> 01:01:48,529
between the arrows and the cap it makes

1526
01:01:46,730 --> 01:01:51,260
sense if you're looking at it doing

1527
01:01:48,530 --> 01:01:54,109
using that procedure you you set the

1528
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:57,290
blue mats to hold your soil at around a

1529
01:01:54,108 --> 01:01:59,630
hundred mbar which is uh minutes and it

1530
01:01:57,289 --> 01:02:02,210
generally stays between 80 and 120 M bar

1531
01:01:59,630 --> 01:02:04,539
which I think is the ideal range the

1532
01:02:02,210 --> 01:02:06,909
idea arranged in our soil now if you're

1533
01:02:04,539 --> 01:02:09,250
say growing in cocoa

1534
01:02:06,909 --> 01:02:10,449
or you're a chem grower and you're

1535
01:02:09,250 --> 01:02:12,099
growing in perlite it might be something

1536
01:02:10,449 --> 01:02:15,219
yeah synthetic growers usually want to

1537
01:02:12,099 --> 01:02:20,710
keep it a little drier and they like to

1538
01:02:15,219 --> 01:02:23,558
keep it like 120 to 160 or 140 280 which

1539
01:02:20,710 --> 01:02:26,470
is which is fine it works for synthetic

1540
01:02:23,559 --> 01:02:28,780
nutrients I think it still should be a

1541
01:02:26,469 --> 01:02:31,118
little bit more moist but if you're

1542
01:02:28,780 --> 01:02:33,359
concerned with root pathogens and drier

1543
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:36,039
might be easier if you're growing in

1544
01:02:33,358 --> 01:02:37,420
infield soil clay soil then you want to

1545
01:02:36,039 --> 01:02:40,059
keep it a little bit drier also it's not

1546
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:42,039
water logging the soil but I have

1547
01:02:40,059 --> 01:02:44,200
purchased and you know the Kitumba soil

1548
01:02:42,039 --> 01:02:46,780
is not the lightest soil like most

1549
01:02:44,199 --> 01:02:50,529
potting soil is that the cannabis

1550
01:02:46,780 --> 01:02:52,569
growers buy has more aeration so this is

1551
01:02:50,530 --> 01:02:54,700
a heavy soil for cannabis growers but

1552
01:02:52,568 --> 01:02:57,099
it's still a light potting soil yeah we

1553
01:02:54,699 --> 01:02:59,500
use pumice which is a big issue in terms

1554
01:02:57,099 --> 01:03:01,480
of the weight but it keeps the perlite

1555
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:04,150
and other MN amendments I don't like

1556
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:05,500
rice hulls as them so the aeration them

1557
01:03:04,150 --> 01:03:07,180
it because they break down too quickly

1558
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:10,119
and I don't like perlite because it

1559
01:03:07,179 --> 01:03:12,098
floats to the surface there's a couple

1560
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:13,269
other things in fact I haven't even told

1561
01:03:12,099 --> 01:03:15,760
you about this but I found a

1562
01:03:13,269 --> 01:03:18,670
diatomaceous earth product it looks just

1563
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:21,849
like perlite or pumice but will break

1564
01:03:18,670 --> 01:03:26,079
down into a silicon that's really

1565
01:03:21,849 --> 01:03:27,818
interesting it's just expensive so it

1566
01:03:26,079 --> 01:03:30,339
vermiculite some other one there that's

1567
01:03:27,818 --> 01:03:32,048
really great it's got a good CEC or

1568
01:03:30,338 --> 01:03:33,548
cation exchange capacity but again

1569
01:03:32,048 --> 01:03:37,179
really expensive so it doesn't make

1570
01:03:33,548 --> 01:03:38,559
sense commercially mm-hmm but yeah and

1571
01:03:37,179 --> 01:03:40,210
also all the rock dusts we're putting in

1572
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:43,059
there increase the weight of the soil as

1573
01:03:40,210 --> 01:03:45,699
well so we do have a heavy soil a

1574
01:03:43,059 --> 01:03:48,460
hundred mbar works great with our mix

1575
01:03:45,699 --> 01:03:50,649
but people can dial that in I guess with

1576
01:03:48,460 --> 01:03:52,838
whatever media they're using using that

1577
01:03:50,650 --> 01:03:57,068
and in the same so I've kept it between

1578
01:03:52,838 --> 01:04:00,278
60 and 80 M bar for entire crop cycles

1579
01:03:57,068 --> 01:04:02,710
and got and got identical results I

1580
01:04:00,278 --> 01:04:06,068
didn't get any water stress or water

1581
01:04:02,710 --> 01:04:08,170
damage on the leaves or no like

1582
01:04:06,068 --> 01:04:09,788
anaerobic conditions nothing slimy down

1583
01:04:08,170 --> 01:04:12,730
there no rotten brown roots at the

1584
01:04:09,789 --> 01:04:14,440
bottom of the pots or beds so it can get

1585
01:04:12,730 --> 01:04:15,880
can't get pretty wet but it gets a good

1586
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:17,380
sketch here when you're running at that

1587
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:19,900
moisture there's no reason to go that

1588
01:04:17,380 --> 01:04:20,680
moist but on Paquita get a moisture

1589
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:23,559
meter

1590
01:04:20,679 --> 01:04:26,440
and calibrate it to your hand like

1591
01:04:23,559 --> 01:04:28,390
squeeze some soil at the same depth as

1592
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:32,048
the moisture meter is stuck in so you

1593
01:04:28,389 --> 01:04:33,879
learn so your meter trains your hand to

1594
01:04:32,048 --> 01:04:36,849
know how much moisture is in the soil or

1595
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:38,858
how heavy the pot is or how fast the

1596
01:04:36,849 --> 01:04:41,650
soil is drying out that sort of thing

1597
01:04:38,858 --> 01:04:44,409
yeah you bring up a good point watering

1598
01:04:41,650 --> 01:04:47,108
I think is the most important thing a

1599
01:04:44,409 --> 01:04:49,719
gardener or grower can do and I think it

1600
01:04:47,108 --> 01:04:51,548
gets overlooked a lot a lot of the times

1601
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:53,139
when I see problems the growers are

1602
01:04:51,548 --> 01:04:55,538
having a lot of is related to their

1603
01:04:53,139 --> 01:04:57,460
watering it kind of exacerbates or

1604
01:04:55,539 --> 01:04:59,500
creates a lot of problems and they can

1605
01:04:57,460 --> 01:05:01,990
display as nutrient deficiencies and a

1606
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:04,269
lot of other things so having a system

1607
01:05:01,989 --> 01:05:07,868
that's automated makes a huge difference

1608
01:05:04,269 --> 01:05:12,038
with this and I think even the best the

1609
01:05:07,869 --> 01:05:14,740
best human waters are going to be less

1610
01:05:12,039 --> 01:05:17,829
not only less efficient but not as good

1611
01:05:14,739 --> 01:05:19,929
as properly dialed in bloom at system

1612
01:05:17,829 --> 01:05:23,019
and I wouldn't be shocked to say you

1613
01:05:19,929 --> 01:05:26,500
could get 10 to 15 better percent 10 to

1614
01:05:23,019 --> 01:05:30,219
15% better yield and growth by switching

1615
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:32,079
to bloom ATS at the very least I've seen

1616
01:05:30,219 --> 01:05:34,659
people who are who are really nerdy

1617
01:05:32,079 --> 01:05:36,430
about watering they lift every pot or

1618
01:05:34,659 --> 01:05:38,920
they or they exqueeze soil in every bed

1619
01:05:36,429 --> 01:05:40,690
and water everything differently every

1620
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:43,119
day and never get runoff no matter how

1621
01:05:40,690 --> 01:05:44,980
geeked out you are a nun watering bloom

1622
01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:47,230
at to at least increase trichome density

1623
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:49,358
that's interesting yeah I think keeping

1624
01:05:47,230 --> 01:05:50,409
your soil evenly moist is the best thing

1625
01:05:49,358 --> 01:05:52,210
you can do and we're talking about

1626
01:05:50,409 --> 01:05:55,659
living soils when we're talking about

1627
01:05:52,210 --> 01:05:58,240
people who want to do no till or you

1628
01:05:55,659 --> 01:06:01,239
know just be organic run around organic

1629
01:05:58,239 --> 01:06:04,479
soils one thing that we didn't touch on

1630
01:06:01,239 --> 01:06:07,598
is even more recent than those drippers

1631
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:10,510
are these bloom at soaker hoses can you

1632
01:06:07,599 --> 01:06:12,579
touch on that a little bit yeah the what

1633
01:06:10,510 --> 01:06:15,069
did you call them blue blue soaked

1634
01:06:12,579 --> 01:06:17,170
they're there they look like they're

1635
01:06:15,068 --> 01:06:19,210
made out of tie that type of material

1636
01:06:17,170 --> 01:06:21,519
and they're designed to work on really

1637
01:06:19,210 --> 01:06:25,119
low pressure so it's like a soaker hose

1638
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:28,088
for a gravity-fed type of thing and so

1639
01:06:25,119 --> 01:06:31,990
the the north american distributor for

1640
01:06:28,088 --> 01:06:33,159
bloom at developed this an adapter so

1641
01:06:31,989 --> 01:06:34,539
you can hook the bloom at sensor

1642
01:06:33,159 --> 01:06:37,599
directly up to this so

1643
01:06:34,539 --> 01:06:39,400
hose and it waters really evenly it's um

1644
01:06:37,599 --> 01:06:43,690
it's pretty sure compensating

1645
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:45,820
essentially I I've gone as far as 25

1646
01:06:43,690 --> 01:06:48,159
feet of the soaker hose per blue mat and

1647
01:06:45,820 --> 01:06:50,019
that works great I like to do less so

1648
01:06:48,159 --> 01:06:53,409
it's so the blue mats are censoring

1649
01:06:50,019 --> 01:06:54,699
sensing smaller zones but uh whatever

1650
01:06:53,409 --> 01:06:56,739
you want to do you can it works great

1651
01:06:54,699 --> 01:06:59,230
outside also and I think that stuff is

1652
01:06:56,739 --> 01:07:01,359
around sixty cents or eighty cents a

1653
01:06:59,230 --> 01:07:04,150
square foot depending on if you get a

1654
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:08,740
protective jacket on it if you're

1655
01:07:04,150 --> 01:07:10,599
outdoors and you have rodents or bugs

1656
01:07:08,739 --> 01:07:12,129
that will chew through the line then you

1657
01:07:10,599 --> 01:07:15,339
want to get a protective jacket on it

1658
01:07:12,130 --> 01:07:17,650
indoors I don't know anyone who's had a

1659
01:07:15,340 --> 01:07:19,570
problem with it without the jacket yeah

1660
01:07:17,650 --> 01:07:21,309
you bring up a good point there around

1661
01:07:19,570 --> 01:07:24,130
the blue mats one thing that I've

1662
01:07:21,309 --> 01:07:26,199
noticed from the manufacturer or the

1663
01:07:24,130 --> 01:07:28,180
distributors is some of the claims that

1664
01:07:26,199 --> 01:07:30,759
they make around I think they say one

1665
01:07:28,179 --> 01:07:32,949
blue mat and so grows can go like a

1666
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:35,590
hundred feet or even further in my

1667
01:07:32,949 --> 01:07:39,009
experience that isn't necessarily the

1668
01:07:35,590 --> 01:07:41,710
way that we liked it so Jaya Jaya helped

1669
01:07:39,010 --> 01:07:43,750
me and I also do custom blue mat setups

1670
01:07:41,710 --> 01:07:44,860
for people so helping people set up

1671
01:07:43,750 --> 01:07:46,420
their room because every room is

1672
01:07:44,860 --> 01:07:48,579
different you can't just go buy a box of

1673
01:07:46,420 --> 01:07:51,309
blue mats and it's gonna fit your

1674
01:07:48,579 --> 01:07:53,590
situation so we found that you know for

1675
01:07:51,309 --> 01:07:55,299
example we like the regular blue mats in

1676
01:07:53,590 --> 01:07:57,130
general better than the max ease unless

1677
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:59,289
you have really deep soil which isn't

1678
01:07:57,130 --> 01:08:00,880
really optimal for cannabis anyway you

1679
01:07:59,289 --> 01:08:03,519
don't like to put blue mats in this in

1680
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:05,380
the side of the container I know there

1681
01:08:03,519 --> 01:08:07,570
was some people taking him and stick him

1682
01:08:05,380 --> 01:08:10,030
into the side of the pot as a way of

1683
01:08:07,570 --> 01:08:13,180
sensing and we found in this side of the

1684
01:08:10,030 --> 01:08:14,650
pot down low and it was the idea that

1685
01:08:13,179 --> 01:08:16,779
you have a sensor in the bottom of the

1686
01:08:14,650 --> 01:08:18,909
soil and a sensor in the top but it just

1687
01:08:16,779 --> 01:08:21,699
never it never worked the bottom of the

1688
01:08:18,909 --> 01:08:24,849
soil is just always more moist and yeah

1689
01:08:21,699 --> 01:08:26,889
don't do it yeah and then with these

1690
01:08:24,850 --> 01:08:29,530
soaker hoses you found that certain

1691
01:08:26,890 --> 01:08:31,030
layouts are more efficient than others

1692
01:08:29,529 --> 01:08:34,630
and like you said you don't want to go

1693
01:08:31,029 --> 01:08:36,000
beyond 25 feet per sensor I usually

1694
01:08:34,630 --> 01:08:38,260
don't even go that far

1695
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:40,539
depending on the depending on the bed

1696
01:08:38,260 --> 01:08:42,100
and you can spiral them or you can weave

1697
01:08:40,539 --> 01:08:43,750
them throughout the plants just to try

1698
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:46,930
and get even coverage yeah they take

1699
01:08:43,750 --> 01:08:48,578
they take corners really well there's I

1700
01:08:46,930 --> 01:08:51,250
mean maybe there's an applic

1701
01:08:48,578 --> 01:08:53,920
for the fittings that take corners but I

1702
01:08:51,250 --> 01:08:56,349
haven't found it they meander really

1703
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:59,739
well with and I like to have them spaced

1704
01:08:56,349 --> 01:09:02,920
about six inches on center or eight

1705
01:08:59,738 --> 01:09:05,698
inches on center and you got to make

1706
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:08,920
sure that the that the soaker hose

1707
01:09:05,698 --> 01:09:11,259
spirals back towards the sensor and it

1708
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:13,569
is about three inches or 4 inches away

1709
01:09:11,259 --> 01:09:15,548
from it so when the soaker hose is

1710
01:09:13,569 --> 01:09:17,710
irrigating it's going to moisten the

1711
01:09:15,548 --> 01:09:19,599
soil and activate that sensor at the

1712
01:09:17,710 --> 01:09:21,460
right time so you don't want it on top

1713
01:09:19,599 --> 01:09:24,429
of the sensor but not too far away from

1714
01:09:21,460 --> 01:09:26,319
the sensor either so that's some some of

1715
01:09:24,429 --> 01:09:28,989
the subtleties of it but once you

1716
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:31,869
understand how it works its intuitive

1717
01:09:28,988 --> 01:09:33,818
the way it goes together great yeah I'll

1718
01:09:31,868 --> 01:09:35,198
put up a bunch of photos and links to

1719
01:09:33,819 --> 01:09:36,849
you for people that go to the podcast

1720
01:09:35,198 --> 01:09:39,098
page so they can read more about it and

1721
01:09:36,849 --> 01:09:41,739
like I said this is something that we do

1722
01:09:39,099 --> 01:09:44,020
we do help people with setting up the

1723
01:09:41,738 --> 01:09:45,698
fluid sliding and the blue mats so

1724
01:09:44,020 --> 01:09:47,460
that's something they can contact us

1725
01:09:45,698 --> 01:09:51,028
directly for if they're interested in

1726
01:09:47,460 --> 01:09:53,649
well I feel like we covered a lot so far

1727
01:09:51,029 --> 01:09:55,480
today I know there's more I want to talk

1728
01:09:53,649 --> 01:09:59,138
about but maybe I could have you back on

1729
01:09:55,479 --> 01:10:00,939
to talk a little more about soil here in

1730
01:09:59,139 --> 01:10:02,380
the near future sure held up - all right

1731
01:10:00,939 --> 01:10:03,250
great well I appreciate your time today

1732
01:10:02,380 --> 01:10:05,109
thank you so much

1733
01:10:03,250 --> 01:10:06,729
and then good talking to you Ted you are

1734
01:10:05,109 --> 01:10:09,339
listening to the cannabis cultivation

1735
01:10:06,729 --> 01:10:11,169
and science podcast I'm your host Todd

1736
01:10:09,340 --> 01:10:13,029
Haas don't forget that there's more

1737
01:10:11,170 --> 01:10:18,578
information articles available on our

1738
01:10:13,029 --> 01:10:20,908
website and blog at WWF comm thanks for

1739
01:10:18,578 --> 01:10:20,908
listening
