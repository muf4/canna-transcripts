1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:07,640
um you know I guess we're getting into

2
00:00:03,718 --> 00:00:09,800
more of the realm of anecdotes here but

3
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:12,518
some Growers well there's two there's

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,798
two things that I've heard from Growers

5
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:17,839
one of them is a myth in my opinion and

6
00:00:14,798 --> 00:00:20,879
that's that sulfur levels like that are

7
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:22,079
uh kill soil biology and I just don't

8
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:25,239
think there's any evidence of that I

9
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:30,479
mean soil soil microbes need

10
00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:33,119
sulfur um and there are certain popul or

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,878
certain species that actually prefer

12
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:37,399
high sulfur environment you may you'll

13
00:00:34,878 --> 00:00:39,799
see a shift in the in the population

14
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:43,320
profile like you will with any

15
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:45,599
management action that you take um but

16
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,520
it definitely doesn't kill microbes I

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,439
think that comes from the idea that

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,559
there are a lot of fungicides in organic

19
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:53,039
production that contain sulfur so

20
00:00:51,558 --> 00:00:54,959
something called the Bordeaux mixture or

21
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,160
lime sulfur like it's a it's a great

22
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,359
fungicide when topically applied to the

23
00:00:57,159 --> 00:01:02,839
leaves but it's in a totally different

24
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:06,400
it's completely different chemistry in

25
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:09,640
those products versus sulfur in the soil

26
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:12,920
um and at 100 PPM it's not toxic it's

27
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:14,439
not costic it's not I I don't understand

28
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:18,280
the functional mechanism in which it

29
00:01:14,438 --> 00:01:20,719
would kill microbes and uh I you still

30
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:22,439
see microbial action I don't have a

31
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:25,239
microscope I don't use a microscope but

32
00:01:22,438 --> 00:01:27,399
you the microbes are clearly

33
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:30,000
thriving based on a number of other

34
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:33,200
metrics when you use a lot of gypson so

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,200
I do not believe that the
