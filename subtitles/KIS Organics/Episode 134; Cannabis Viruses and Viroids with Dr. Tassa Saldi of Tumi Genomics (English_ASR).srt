00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:22,198
welcome to the Cannabis cultivation and

3
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,519
science podcast I'm your host Tad hussy

4
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:26,000
of Kiss Organics this is the podcast

5
00:00:24,518 --> 00:00:28,118
where we discuss The Cutting Edge of

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
growing from a science-based perspective

7
00:00:28,118 --> 00:00:32,039
and drawing top experts from around the

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,200
industry to share their wisdom and

9
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:36,200
knowledge now before getting into the

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,640
podcast I want to let listeners know of

11
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:40,520
a couple of things first off we just

12
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,079
released a new Bloom booster that we've

13
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,879
been formulating and testing for the

14
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:47,120
past 2 years it's now available on our

15
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:49,159
website and it is the cleanest organic

16
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:51,359
Bloom booster on the market I'm really

17
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:52,878
excited about it and secondly I want to

18
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:55,399
let folks know that we have some new

19
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:57,000
content on YouTube including recordings

20
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:58,960
of some recent talks I've given this

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,439
year at conferences around the world

22
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,518
with one highlighting some of the

23
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:06,640
content from six years of these

24
00:01:03,518 --> 00:01:09,478
podcasts my guest this week is Dr Tassa

25
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,560
saldi Dr saldi is a molecular biologist

26
00:01:09,478 --> 00:01:14,239
with more than 25 years of research

27
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:17,159
experience in RNA biology infectious

28
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:19,759
disease and molecular pathogen detection

29
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:21,880
Dr saldi graduated Summa kumlade with a

30
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,799
degree in molecular biology she

31
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:25,719
completed her graduate and post-doctoral

32
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:28,320
studies at the University of Colorado

33
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:31,000
where she studied RNA structure small

34
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:32,679
rnas and RNA processing ing she was

35
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,560
awarded a prestigious Fellowship from

36
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,759
the American Cancer Society and was one

37
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,240
of 18 doctoral fellows Nationwide

38
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:41,040
invited to present a research at the

39
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:42,560
Aspen cancer conference Dr saldi has

40
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,920

Tumi genomics Dr saldi continues to use

44
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,479
her expertise to provide the Cannabis

45
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,840
industry with reliable accurate

46
00:01:53,478 --> 00:02:00,158
diagnostic tools and pathogen mitigation

47
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,799
guidance now on to the show

48
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,439
hi tasa thanks for coming on the show

49
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:05,920
today yes absolutely thanks so much for

50
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:08,519
having me this is an exciting

51
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,318
opportunity for sure yeah can you tell

52
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:16,439
me a little bit about yourself and uh

53
00:02:11,318 --> 00:02:19,159
tuming as well yes um absolutely so um

54
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:22,800
I'm tatha I'm the chief science officer

55
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:26,239
over at Tumi genomics um as far as my

56
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:29,959
background is concerned I am a molecular

57
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:32,719
biologist I did all of my education both

58
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:35,479
my undergrad and graduate and postdoc

59
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:38,120
work um at the University of Colorado

60
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:40,639
either in Boulder or Denver um and

61
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:45,120
pretty much all of my expertise is

62
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:47,279
around um RNA which is um a molecule

63
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,680
that can carry information very similar

64
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,878
to DNA um it can it also has some other

65
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,239
interesting functions um and

66
00:02:51,878 --> 00:02:56,199
consequently it's also the molecule that

67
00:02:54,239 --> 00:03:00,158
represents hopl and viroids that's all

68
00:02:56,199 --> 00:03:03,598
it is um and so I did a lot of work on

69
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:05,479
understanding how um RNA is processed

70
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:07,878
how that like a structure or the shape

71
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:10,919
that it forms impacts um how it's

72
00:03:07,878 --> 00:03:13,359
treated in the cell um and and kind of

73
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:16,919
just um investigations into RNA

74
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:19,760
processing in general so um as far as

75
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:23,518
Tumi genomics uh our company was founded

76
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:26,120
a little bit over four years ago and um

77
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:29,080
so basically we were a group of uh

78
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:31,319
postdocs and some entrepreneurs and we

79
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:33,239
just decided you know we're done with

80
00:03:31,318 --> 00:03:34,560
Academia we'd like to do something with

81
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:37,000
what we know how to do that actually

82
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,280
will help people and and create products

83
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,680
that will change something in the world

84
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,759
um so we decided to found Tumi genomics

85
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:48,040
and um the beginning of our company was

86
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:50,438
kind of crazy uh we pivoted a bunch we

87
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:54,120
did cancer genomics we ended up making

88
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:56,199
covid diagnostics for a while um and

89
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:59,879
worked in the co Diagnostic lab at CU

90
00:03:56,199 --> 00:04:03,000
Boulder um and kind of underneath that

91
00:03:59,878 --> 00:04:05,719
we um uh we had some connections with

92
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,158
some growers in cannabis and we had one

93
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:11,598
grower contact us um uh in California

94
00:04:09,158 --> 00:04:13,719
and she was having issues with uh hot PL

95
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:16,399
and vroid and she was having a hard time

96
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:18,439
finding tests in Labs that could test

97
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:20,638
for it that she that was reliable that

98
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:22,040
she would um um believe in and so she

99
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,879
asked us if we could help her out and

100
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:26,120
we're like sure you know we're molecular

101
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:29,759
biologists um we can definitely put

102
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:31,399
something like that together and um we

103
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,840
kind of just grew from there through

104
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:36,439
word of mouth and I think you know once

105
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:38,719
we started getting into the Cannabis

106
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:40,600
industry we realized that this was

107
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,240
absolutely the place that we wanted to

108
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:45,879
be um because we founded our company

109
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,720
with the mission of bringing highquality

110
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:51,360
rigorous science to underserved

111
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:53,720
Industries and when we realized how much

112
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,720
the industry needed more research more

113
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:59,720
education more Outreach it was it was

114
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:02,759
like this is exactly why we started a

115
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:05,560
company in the first place um and so

116
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:08,240
yeah we've been working in cannabis for

117
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:10,800
three years or something like that um

118
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,840
and uh it's a great industry to be in

119
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,520
there's so many opportunities and and so

120
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:17,079
much to learn which is the fun part of

121
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:17,079
science

122
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:22,639
so well I so I did a podcast with Dr

123
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:25,319
Jack Muntz of Three Rivers biotech

124
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:27,038
talking a bit about hlvd and bids and

125
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:28,680
pathogens so folks can go back and and

126
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:30,839
listen to that as well but I want to

127
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,400
kind of cover some of the Basics again

128
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:36,638
in this one and sort of hear your your

129
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:39,079
experience and take on things too so uh

130
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,680
let's talk initially what is it

131
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:42,439
important from a grower perspective to

132
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,439
really understand the difference between

133
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:48,000
a virus and a

134
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:49,120
viroid um I think certain aspects of

135
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,759
understanding the difference between

136
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:55,120
those two are important um probably the

137
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:59,360
two most important aspects for people to

138
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:02,879
understand are that um viroids lack any

139
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:05,360
type of outside protection so most most

140
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:07,598
organisms or life has like a genome

141
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,759
that's the information that tells that

142
00:06:07,598 --> 00:06:11,598
life how to be whatever it's supposed to

143
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,439
be right and then on the outside of it

144
00:06:11,598 --> 00:06:16,800
is like a fat layer or protein layer

145
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:19,279
that keeps that information safe so when

146
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,439
you try to kill a pathogen a lot of the

147
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:22,638
things that you're going to treat it

148
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:24,918
with are targeting that outside layer

149
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:27,360
like soap dissolves fat and so that'll

150
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:29,719
make it that'll make it fall apart um

151
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,598
like quaner ammonia though like clean

152
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,599
grow those kinds of things are you know

153
00:06:31,598 --> 00:06:35,279
targeting

154
00:06:32,598 --> 00:06:37,560
proteins because hopl EnV virid lacks

155
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:40,119
all of those things there are limited

156
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:42,879
number of disinfectants that you can use

157
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:45,160
that are effective which is why you have

158
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:48,240
you know basically bleach or Veron and

159
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:50,639
there isn't um a ton of other

160
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,319
disinfectants um the other really

161
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:56,240
important thing to understand is that

162
00:06:53,319 --> 00:07:00,000
viroids lack what I would say unique

163
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,598
biology so if you get um a bacterial

164
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,360
infection you can take an antibiotic

165
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:05,639
right because the antibiotic is

166
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,439
targeting something specific about

167
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:11,720
bacteria that's different than you um or

168
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:15,399
an antifungal or even an antiviral but

169
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:17,440
because um viroids don't have that

170
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:20,878
unique biology where you can you can

171
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:23,439
make an anti um except for the sequence

172
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:26,400
of the actual genome it's much more

173
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:28,399
difficult to come up with treatments

174
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:29,878
right so if you if you have an antiviral

175
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:31,799
or an antifungal that's that's not going

176
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:34,400
to have any impact on Hop plate and

177
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:37,520
thyroid um and so it's very unique

178
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:40,399
because of of those two uh

179
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:41,478
factors are there any other viroids I'm

180
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:43,959
not aware of any are there any other

181
00:07:41,478 --> 00:07:45,279
viroids in cannabis that are of major

182
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:48,598
economic

183
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:52,038
importance um yeah not right now um if

184
00:07:48,598 --> 00:07:54,759
you look in hops which is very um

185
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:57,839
similar biology genetically to cannabis

186
00:07:54,759 --> 00:08:00,158
in the same family there are um other

187
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:03,318
viroids that can be very dangerous

188
00:08:00,158 --> 00:08:07,719
there's um hop stunt vroid crackling

189
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:10,319
bark apple fruit crinkle vroid none of

190
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:13,919
those have been characterized as of yet

191
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:17,560
in cannabis um but because cannabis is

192
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:19,758
now becoming legal and its presence is

193
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:21,280
spreading all across obviously all

194
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,240
across the United States and all across

195
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:25,959
the world the possibility of some of

196
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:28,879
these other viroids um kind of jumping

197
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:31,680
ship over into cannabis um continues to

198
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:34,759
increase and so I suspect we will find

199
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:37,360
other viroids um in the near future but

200
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:41,158
as of yet we haven't found

201
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:44,839
any okay and what are some some best

202
00:08:41,158 --> 00:08:47,200
practices in general in regards to sort

203
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:49,560
of all pathogens you know viruses

204
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:52,040
viroids bacteria fungi all of these

205
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:56,000
things that can damage our plants yes

206
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:58,838
absolutely so um so best practices the I

207
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,120
think the first and most important thing

208
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:03,200
that All Growers whether you're growing

209
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,440
a plant in your basement or you know

210
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,640
your huge cultivation facility is to

211
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:12,000
think about pathogens in a proactive way

212
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:14,000
it is infinitely easier to prevent them

213
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,879
from entering your facility than it is

214
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,919
to mitigate them once they have spread

215
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:23,120
through your facility um so how do you

216
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:25,719
prevent that um so we have kind of a

217
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,600
dorky acronym or whatever at Tumi

218
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:30,240
genomics called stop which kind of

219
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,839
outlines the four big points of uh

220
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,560
pathogen prevention um so the S stands

221
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:37,600
for sterilization you always need to be

222
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:39,719
thinking about sterilizing your tools

223
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,600
sterilizing your pots you want to make

224
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,600
sure your water is sterilized if you're

225
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,360
getting it from you know a well Source

226
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,560
or something else where there could be

227
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,120
fungus in it um surfaces sterilizing

228
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:51,958
your hands as you move from plant to

229
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:55,480
plant just making sure you have clean

230
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:57,919
practices right um the T is for testing

231
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:00,360
uh it's really important that you test

232
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:03,000
the single most common way anything is

233
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:04,560
going to get into your facility is on

234
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,879
plant tissue all right so if you're

235
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:10,639
taking in clones or seeds um those

236
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:12,919
things come with unwanted hitchhikers

237
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:14,799
right and the only way to make sure that

238
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:17,639
they don't gain access to your precious

239
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:19,240
mother stock is to test them before you

240
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:22,399
put them in next to the rest of your

241
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,600
mom's so and then preventative testing

242
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:27,120
just to make sure that nothing is

243
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,959
brewing in your facility um the O is for

244
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,600
organization you want to make sure that

245
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:34,838
your documenting your testing you have

246
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,440
like a a a a correct and and organized

247
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:38,839
schedule that you're thinking about the

248
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:41,320
flow of traffic obviously you don't want

249
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:43,240
people to start you know in a in a high

250
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:45,959
pathogen pressure area and then go to

251
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,959
the mountain room and start C cutting or

252
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:49,919
whatever because you're just going to

253
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:51,359
end up pulling those pathogens in um and

254
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:54,120
then the P is for protecting your

255
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,839
borders so that's obviously testing

256
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:59,278
before you bring new stuff in but also

257
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,959
thinking about um your water system your

258
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:02,838
growing medium can you can bring

259
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:05,278
pathogens in like that you can bring it

260
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:08,079
in on the air and I mean it can even

261
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:09,838
they can even come in on your friends so

262
00:11:08,078 --> 00:11:11,719
um make sure that people are you know

263
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,160
using gloves and covering their clothes

264
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,519
because you want to keep all of that

265
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:17,958
stuff out so so you have the control as

266
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:20,200
to what organisms are allowed to grow on

267
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:23,199
your plants

268
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:25,720
basically since we're talking about best

269
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:29,320
practices I this this question came up

270
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:31,320
recently in regards to a new facility

271
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:36,000
starting out uh that needs to get

272
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:39,000
genetics now obviously Colones can can

273
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,759
bring in you know hop and vroid or other

274
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,679
things and if we want to start clean and

275
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:43,799
stay

276
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:45,679
clean uh what would be the best

277
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:47,799
practices and I'll throw out a scenario

278
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:50,919
for and then you can tell me how you how

279
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:54,039
you might approach it so our thought was

280
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:56,838
initially to grow a mother plant for two

281
00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:59,240
to three months test that mother plant

282
00:11:56,839 --> 00:12:03,399
test the roots of that mother plant for

283
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:06,399
pop and viroid and then if that's clean

284
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:07,919
uh then we could pull clones off of that

285
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,919
and then when those get larger test

286
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:13,639
those and feel fairly confident that the

287
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:15,759
plant is clean um what would what would

288
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:17,680
you do well first off how does that

289
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:20,078
sound as just sort of a good protocol

290
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:23,000
for moving something into your

291
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:25,559
facility yes so absolutely so if you're

292
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,519
um so so if the scenario is that you

293
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:30,000
already have some plants and you're

294
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,919
bringing in a set of new genetics

295
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,600
um the first most important step is to

296
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:37,399
define a quarantine area because you

297
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:40,079
need to to create a space with um that

298
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:42,600
has like unknown infection status and

299
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:44,278
that space has its own set of tools and

300
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,920
everybody knows that these plants could

301
00:12:44,278 --> 00:12:48,078
be dirty and so they're incredibly

302
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:49,838
careful you don't you don't use those

303
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:51,919
tools anywhere else in the facility you

304
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:54,680
don't like work on those plants and then

305
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:56,639
go to the other plants um those plants

306
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:59,198
when you bring them in there's a couple

307
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:01,000
important things first um I would

308
00:12:59,198 --> 00:13:03,240
definitely test like you said right away

309
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,600
the root system for hop latent I would

310
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:08,039
also think about testing for ferium and

311
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,839
pythium those are two incredibly

312
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:13,639
damaging root pathogens and in some ways

313
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:16,120
especially ferium can be more damaging

314
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:18,079
than hop latent because if it gets out

315
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:21,278
of control you can lose like an entire

316
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:24,439
table in a week um it because it just

317
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:27,919
spreads really quickly and it's lethal

318
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:29,600
um also observe right sometimes you'll

319
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:31,000
you'll have them there you let them grow

320
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,320
a little bit and things like fungus

321
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,440
knats and whatnot fly out and and it's

322
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:37,839
important to to watch them and make sure

323
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:41,240
that you don't see anything concerning

324
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:44,320
um I would wait three to four weeks on

325
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:46,639
those plants and then test them again um

326
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,720
and if you get two negative tests then

327
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,120
you can feel pretty confident that those

328
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,879
plants are not

329
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:55,120
infected um that being said once they go

330
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:57,078
into the rotation with your regular

331
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:00,159
mother plants there should be some type

332
00:13:57,078 --> 00:14:02,638
of preventative testing that you're just

333
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:04,639
continually doing on your mother's stock

334
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:07,600
and then it should go into that rotation

335
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:09,680
of testing um because even if you're not

336
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,159
bringing in these pathogens especially

337
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:13,638
the fungal ones can get into your

338
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:15,360
facility a lot of different ways um so

339
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:18,440
it's good to always be double checking

340
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:21,120
and making sure that Mom's stock is

341
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:24,560
healthy yeah and knowing that uh hop

342
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:28,120
latent can come in on seeds

343
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:30,719
now what's the best practice there in

344
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:32,198
terms of testing and protocols for

345
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:36,440
making sure that you're getting CLE

346
00:14:32,198 --> 00:14:39,399
clean seed genetics yes yeah so um it it

347
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:42,560
depends on how many seeds you're buying

348
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:45,919
and um kind of how that works into the

349
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:48,159
logistics of your facility um hoplon

350
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:50,360
vroid is in an incredibly High

351
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:53,120
concentration in the flour and so what

352
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:57,440
we found is if a seed comes from an

353
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:59,198
infected mother even if the inside of

354
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,800
that seed doesn't necessarily have top

355
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:03,039
latent there's a really high

356
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:05,838
concentration of it on the outside so

357
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:07,759
you can answer the question did this

358
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,839
seed come from an infected Mother by

359
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:12,720
just testing a few of the seeds from the

360
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:15,120
batch that you've just purchased um

361
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,399
obviously the best way is to ask the

362
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,120
seed producer to to give you some data

363
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:20,639
showing that they tested the mom before

364
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,000
they went and put it into a breeding

365
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,879
program um I would still go ahead and

366
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,240
test it again when you get it to your

367
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:30,360
facility um if you only have 10 seeds or

368
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,198
something like that and you pop those

369
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:34,318
you can let that plant grow up into like

370
00:15:32,198 --> 00:15:36,439
the fourleaf stage um and you can

371
00:15:34,318 --> 00:15:39,198
actually find it in that the embryonic

372
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:42,519
Leaf pretty early on um so you can test

373
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:45,958
them at that point and uh ditch the ones

374
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:48,440
that test positive if any of them

375
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:51,799
do but you can actually test seed then

376
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:55,079
you're saying fairly reliably absolutely

377
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:57,919
good efficacy yes it's it's very good

378
00:15:55,078 --> 00:16:01,120
and um so the the one important concept

379
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:02,599
to remember so hlate and virid is in a

380
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,639
very con High concentration on the

381
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:07,319
outside of the seed like the coat but

382
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:10,639
it's also um kind on a high

383
00:16:07,318 --> 00:16:12,318
concentration um on the inside layer but

384
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,278
that doesn't necessarily mean every

385
00:16:12,318 --> 00:16:17,278
single one of those seeds will give rise

386
00:16:14,278 --> 00:16:19,679
to a positive plant so when we did these

387
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:21,838
experiments we if it was taken from a

388
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:25,559
positive mother we saw something like

389
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:28,440
90% of those seeds 90 to 95% of those

390
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:31,000
seeds tested very high positive um but

391
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:34,920
when we grew the uh plants from those

392
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:37,839
seeds we got closer to um 20 to 50%

393
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:40,198
depending on the cultivar

394
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:42,800
so not every single one of those seeds

395
00:16:40,198 --> 00:16:44,240
is going to become a positive plant but

396
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:46,039
if you don't want to risk it then you

397
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,639
can test the seeds themselves and say

398
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:49,240
okay this all came from a positive

399
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:51,000
mother I don't I don't even want to

400
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:53,959
plant them in my

401
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,159
facility so a well a couple questions so

402
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:58,919
a seed manufacturer could actually send

403
00:16:56,159 --> 00:17:00,879
you some seeds then like five or 10

404
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:03,318
seeds from a batch and and feel fairly

405
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:05,519
if they all test negative feel fairly

406
00:17:03,318 --> 00:17:07,798
confident in the seeds that they're

407
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:10,240
sending out the door it sounds like is

408
00:17:07,798 --> 00:17:12,240
what you're saying yes yeah so it would

409
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,038
so what they would need to do is

410
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,558
segregate the seeds so that um each seed

411
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:19,400
batch was actually representing a single

412
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:21,519
mother so that then you know we would

413
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,199
expect most of the seeds excuse me taken

414
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:25,838
from that positive mother to test

415
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:28,240
positive um yeah and of course you know

416
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:30,279
if if I were Growing Seeds I would

417
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:33,558
definitely be testing my moms before I

418
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:35,519
fertilized them and and the dads too um

419
00:17:33,558 --> 00:17:37,480
because it can come through to a lesser

420
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:39,440
extent in the pollen and just make sure

421
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:41,558
that everything is clean and that that

422
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,558
would be a question I would ask too if I

423
00:17:41,558 --> 00:17:46,720
were purchasing seeds did you test the

424
00:17:43,558 --> 00:17:51,639
parents and of these plant before you

425
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:54,679
fertilized it on the testing side of

426
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,960
things because testing is so expensive

427
00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:59,559
um I'm just trying to think of how we

428
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:03,200
can do this most efficiently

429
00:17:59,558 --> 00:18:05,678
um is it better to test the mother's

430
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:08,038
roots or is it better to test the

431
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:11,120
progyny like the seeds uh from that

432
00:18:08,038 --> 00:18:14,798
mother if you had to choose for

433
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:16,918
example yeah so I I would definitely if

434
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:18,359
if you're if it's the econ economics is

435
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:21,759
a thing I would definitely test the

436
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:23,279
mother um because if yeah if because

437
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:24,798
then you'll know that it came from a

438
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:27,839
positive mother and then you don't need

439
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:30,599
to to test the seeds and how many tests

440
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:34,119
do I need to do on on that mother plant

441
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:36,119
to feel reliably confident um you know

442
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:37,639
with a certain confidence interval that

443
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:39,399
the plant is actually clean because I

444
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:41,480
realized you send in one test it could

445
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:45,600
come back negative that that doesn't

446
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:48,480
mean 100% that uh that plant is clean

447
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:50,839
yeah absolutely yeah so um we generally

448
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,599
tell people to wait um about three weeks

449
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:55,519
in between testing and to get at least

450
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:57,839
two negative tests in the lifetime of

451
00:18:55,519 --> 00:19:00,679
the mother before you either use it in a

452
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:04,119
breeding program or um cut clones from

453
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:06,080
it so um I would test that mother

454
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:08,918
probably right when it was a freshly

455
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:11,000
rooted clone and then test it again

456
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:13,240
before you decide to use it in in

457
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,480
production or to cut clones or or

458
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:17,319
fertilize

459
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:21,079
it okay now you mentioned that not all

460
00:19:17,319 --> 00:19:24,879
of the plants that tested positive for a

461
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:29,079
the vroid would express it or or have a

462
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:30,720
significant vir vroid load in the actual

463
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:35,000
plant itself as it grew up I think you

464
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:36,558
said 20 to 50% was the number range so

465
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,960
that being said can you talk a little

466
00:19:36,558 --> 00:19:41,558
bit about virid load and what that

467
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,519
really means in relation to the media

468
00:19:41,558 --> 00:19:47,038
that we're growing in and the plant

469
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:50,759
itself yes absolutely um so vroid load

470
00:19:47,038 --> 00:19:53,158
formally means how much thyroid um was

471
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:56,079
detected in the tissue that you sent in

472
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:58,400
to sample um and if the test that you

473
00:19:56,079 --> 00:20:00,000
have has an internal control um that the

474
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,798
test that you're getting then that can

475
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:07,079
even be normalized to um the total

476
00:20:02,798 --> 00:20:09,639
amount of tissue so um that is a proxy

477
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:11,759
for how infected the plant really is is

478
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:15,120
it just a mild infection or is it like

479
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:17,158
on fire with hop plat and thyroid um so

480
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:19,199
in the research that we've uh been

481
00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:22,280
working on um with state house uh

482
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:25,080
cultivation actually we found that there

483
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:28,798
is a correlation between a higher vroid

484
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:31,279
load and manifestation of symptoms um

485
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:32,759
it's not 100% you can definitely find

486
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:34,639
plants that have an incredibly High

487
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:37,240
vroid load that don't appear to be

488
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:39,720
terribly affected and plants that have

489
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:42,960
like a medium load but still you get a

490
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:47,200
pretty significant loss in yield um but

491
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:49,200
in general if that virid load is High um

492
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,480
you're going to see a more affected

493
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,679
plant and you're increasing your risk of

494
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:55,759
spreading it um because even if that

495
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:59,038
plant doesn't look terribly sick if

496
00:20:55,759 --> 00:21:00,879
there's a ton of vroid on it then um

497
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:04,798
your chances of that plant spreading it

498
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:08,720
throughout your facility um is is much

499
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:10,879
higher so when you say spreading it too

500
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,400
um my understanding and please do

501
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:16,200
correct me if I if I say this wrong is

502
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:18,840
that it's it's not being it's not being

503
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:22,080
Airborne spread it's really

504
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:24,240
through uh the same water like sitting

505
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:29,240
in the same water source or sitting in

506
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:32,599
the same Media or in actual uh like

507
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:34,640
damage or or like really rough touching

508
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:36,079
of the plant tissue itself like if you

509
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,120
brush against a plant and then brush

510
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:40,599
against another plant you probably

511
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:43,479
didn't spread hop Laden is that an

512
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:45,918
accurate assumption or is it more

513
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:48,159
contagious than I realized yeah no that

514
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:50,640
is correct um in order to spread hop L

515
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:52,960
and virid there has to be sap transfer

516
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,919
so basically breakage from the sick

517
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:58,720
plant um that sap has to get into a

518
00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:01,559
wound even a micro wound on the the

519
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,679
healthy plant in order to transmit it um

520
00:22:01,558 --> 00:22:05,440
the water transmission happens in the

521
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:07,480
root Zone because you have cells that

522
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,480
are kind of sloughing off of the root

523
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:12,640
continuously and those those are

524
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:14,759
releasing vroid into the water um

525
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,038
there's also a potential for insect

526
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:20,038
spread I know they're working on those

527
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:22,558
experiments at the the uh Colorado State

528
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:24,359
here in Fort Collins and I do think that

529
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:27,399
they're finding some positive results

530
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:29,278
for insect spread as well um but just

531
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,320
touching a plant or having plants near

532
00:22:29,278 --> 00:22:33,759
each other that one sick and one isn't

533
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:34,759
isn't isn't necessarily sufficient to

534
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:39,440
spread

535
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:41,960
it great so this next question is one

536
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:44,240
that comes from Steve kwell uh a friend

537
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:46,278
of mine at Green Life Productions and he

538
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:50,159
brought up a good point around this

539
00:22:46,278 --> 00:22:52,480
question in the sense that as we do more

540
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:54,880
testing or as we make hop Laton into a

541
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,679
bigger issue we're potentially opening

542
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,520
ourselves up as an industry to Greater

543
00:22:56,679 --> 00:23:02,919
regulation and greater testing which

544
00:22:58,519 --> 00:23:04,278
puts an undue burden upon Growers um and

545
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:06,200
and frankly raises the cost of

546
00:23:04,278 --> 00:23:08,880
everything across the board now

547
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:10,840
obviously I think testing is important

548
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,640
um but are there ways that we can

549
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:16,720
effectively manage this I guess without

550
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:19,840
testing and and his hypothesis was that

551
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:22,759
if we are cycling our plants rapidly and

552
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:24,599
reducing vroid load by growing healthy

553
00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:27,640
plants and clothing off of healthy

554
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:31,719
plants even if there was some vroid load

555
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:35,480
in the plant itself self could we in

556
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:37,519
theory um reduce that vroid load cycle

557
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:40,000
after cycle to where it's a non-factor

558
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:43,119
of of any economic importance or or

559
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:46,000
virtually you know disappears I guess

560
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:48,158
what are your thoughts on that um yeah

561
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,400
so it depends a little bit on the virid

562
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:53,520
load of the plant that you begin with um

563
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:55,840
so if you have a plant that has an

564
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:58,200
incredibly lowlevel infection or an

565
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:59,839
early infection what's I mean what's

566
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:03,200
really happening is that the infection

567
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:05,240
enters at one spot um and then it

568
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,880
viroids can't move on their own right

569
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:09,400
they don't have like Tails or or

570
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,200
whatever so it moves in the SAP with the

571
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:14,400
photo assimilates and that's kind of a

572
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:16,159
slow process so theoretically you could

573
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,960
have a virid slowly spreading through

574
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:21,840
the plant and if you clone from that

575
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:24,159
plant and um take an area where there

576
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:27,038
isn't a high level of vroid and then you

577
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:30,278
like continually repeat that process um

578
00:24:27,038 --> 00:24:32,640
you can probably get that vir down uh to

579
00:24:30,278 --> 00:24:34,519
undetectable levels and I have had

580
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,278
people tell me that they've done that

581
00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:37,679
process and gotten plants that didn't

582
00:24:36,278 --> 00:24:40,720
have anything and they've had it for a

583
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:42,159
year and it's still testing negative um

584
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,759
I've also had people that tried to do

585
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,080
that and then they thought they were

586
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:48,000
everything was great and six months

587
00:24:45,079 --> 00:24:50,398
later it started to test positive again

588
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:54,200
um the one thing to understand about

589
00:24:50,398 --> 00:24:57,398
thyroids is they hijack the metabolism

590
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:59,120
of the plant and so if the plant is

591
00:24:57,398 --> 00:25:01,439
growing very vigorous ly and it's

592
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:04,038
incredibly healthy it it's definitely

593
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:07,798
going to be better at fighting off

594
00:25:04,038 --> 00:25:10,398
fungal pathogens bacterial pathogens uh

595
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:12,440
with its innate immune system but a

596
00:25:10,398 --> 00:25:14,719
really healthy vigorously growing plant

597
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:17,840
isn't necessarily going to be better at

598
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:20,120
fighting off hopl vroid it might be

599
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:23,759
better at not manifesting those symptoms

600
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:26,439
quite as dramatically but um the faster

601
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:28,839
the plant grows the more cells are

602
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:31,120
replicating and and and metabolis izing

603
00:25:28,839 --> 00:25:32,119
the virid is hijacking that process and

604
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:33,918
also

605
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:36,678
replicating

606
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:38,440
um what I think what I what I try to

607
00:25:36,679 --> 00:25:42,559
convince people to do when I talk to

608
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:44,720
them about this issue is that um you can

609
00:25:42,558 --> 00:25:47,398
reduce the amount of testing and still

610
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:50,240
be effective if you change the way your

611
00:25:47,398 --> 00:25:53,119
mother stock is organized a little bit

612
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:56,120
so in general a usually what they have

613
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:58,479
are nuclear stock like mothers that are

614
00:25:56,119 --> 00:26:01,359
of heightened phytosanitary

615
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:05,000
um uh protocols and there's only a few

616
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:07,558
plants that represent each strain um and

617
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,558
that's the core of your genetic library

618
00:26:07,558 --> 00:26:11,200
and those plants should be tested all of

619
00:26:09,558 --> 00:26:13,918
the time for anything that could

620
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,919
economically destroy your facility but

621
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:18,399
it doesn't have to be thousands of

622
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:21,038
mother plants right if you have two or

623
00:26:18,398 --> 00:26:22,398
three plants per strain and you have I

624
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:25,158
don't know 10 strains or whatever it's

625
00:26:22,398 --> 00:26:27,639
not a huge number of plants from those

626
00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:30,399
plants you can clone produ production

627
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:34,159
mothers and at that point you can start

628
00:26:30,398 --> 00:26:36,038
testing less or you can spot test um but

629
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:37,880
you don't have to be quite as rigorous

630
00:26:36,038 --> 00:26:40,038
with those and then the rigger can go

631
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:42,559
down and down and down as it moves

632
00:26:40,038 --> 00:26:45,720
through the production facility it's

633
00:26:42,558 --> 00:26:48,000
just important to keep that Center of

634
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:50,640
nuclear mother stock as clean as

635
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,679
possible um and like that you reduce the

636
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:55,320
number of tests but it's incredibly

637
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:59,480
effective at keeping pathogens from

638
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:59,480
moving down the production line

639
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:04,559
yeah I see some I see some challenges

640
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:08,558
with that in cannabis uh I love that

641
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:10,480
idea I just worry in the sense that um

642
00:27:08,558 --> 00:27:13,119
well we we try to turn our mother stock

643
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:15,120
over because it gets Woody so every

644
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:17,558
cycle we're usually taking a new mother

645
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:19,359
for the next cycle you can maybe go two

646
00:27:17,558 --> 00:27:22,200
cycles but beyond that it gets really

647
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:25,719
challenging uh to keep cloning off the

648
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:28,240
same plant but but I think your your

649
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:30,159
concept still still works with this idea

650
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,960
of keeping some being hypervigilant

651
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:35,520
about a select number of plants yes kind

652
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,399
of going Downstream exactly so the

653
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:39,200
concept would be I wouldn't recommend

654
00:27:37,398 --> 00:27:42,439
keeping mother plants more than a couple

655
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:46,519
months but when you go to clone to

656
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:48,278
replace that that mother you don't clone

657
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:49,880
all of your production plants all your

658
00:27:48,278 --> 00:27:51,599
production mothers and then randomly

659
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:53,840
pick a few that will go back and

660
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:56,719
represent your new like special nuclear

661
00:27:53,839 --> 00:28:00,199
mother you'll clone a few plants and

662
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:02,159
they stay in that special area and those

663
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:04,319
will be and from those you select the

664
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:07,000
one that will replace that mother so

665
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:09,918
it's like it's it's like a small cycle

666
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,679
for your nuclear stock and then a bigger

667
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:14,679
cycle comes out for your production

668
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:17,519
mothers and they go um basically cloned

669
00:28:14,679 --> 00:28:19,240
into all veg plants at that point so

670
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:20,960
it's you you continually refresh them

671
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:23,159
but you keep it internal into that

672
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,319
special group of moms if that makes

673
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:27,200
sense yeah and just a reminder to folks

674
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:29,839
to make sure you're sanitizing your

675
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,880
tools when you're taking any when you're

676
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:35,079
when you're wounding a plant in any way

677
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:36,840
um and I believe vercon was found uh Dr

678
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:38,759
zamir Puna did some research on this and

679
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:41,720
found vercon to be the most effective

680
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:45,599
sanitary tool for hop latent more so

681
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:49,079
than bleach is that correct so um so

682
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:51,000
vercon 2% was found to be effective in

683
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:53,199
the research against potato spindle

684
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,200
tuber vroid which comes from the same

685
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:58,960
vroid family as hop latent so we would

686
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:02,399
expect it to be just as effective

687
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:07,079
um 10% bleach has been used in the

688
00:29:02,398 --> 00:29:09,319
literature since 1969 or something so

689
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:11,558
that is generally been shown to be

690
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:13,678
effective against every vroid in every

691
00:29:11,558 --> 00:29:15,119
plant species since the beginning of the

692
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:18,840
time that they've been doing these

693
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:21,558
experiments um so I would one of those

694
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:23,519
two either 2% Von and do be careful with

695
00:29:21,558 --> 00:29:27,000
that because one% was shown not to be

696
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:29,038
effective or um that 10% bleach both of

697
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,759
those seem to work really quite

698
00:29:29,038 --> 00:29:36,240
well

699
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:39,440
wonderful uh on let's see on that note

700
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,759
um I lost my I lost my train of thought

701
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,679
with that because I was thinking about

702
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:46,200
sterilization but I wanted to go back to

703
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:48,640
this mother stock idea because we were

704
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:50,399
talking about mother stock so we're

705
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,759
we're taking our clones we're making

706
00:29:50,398 --> 00:29:54,119
sure those are clean we're putting them

707
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:58,519
out and then hopefully going from there

708
00:29:54,119 --> 00:30:00,678
um ah my question was have have we

709
00:29:58,519 --> 00:30:04,000
discovered has science figured out uh

710
00:30:00,679 --> 00:30:06,798
what triggers this latent vroid to

711
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:10,079
express itself do we know what

712
00:30:06,798 --> 00:30:11,839
environmental factors are really key in

713
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:14,678
causing

714
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:17,798
expression um yeah

715
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:22,000
so what we've found there's a couple

716
00:30:17,798 --> 00:30:25,158
factors um genetics of the cultivar is

717
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,319
an important factor um we found plants

718
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:28,840
that were incredibly susceptible mildly

719
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:30,678
susceptible

720
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:32,839
um all the way up to plants that were

721
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:34,759
tolerant which means that they had a ton

722
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:37,720
of vroid and they just didn't care it

723
00:30:34,759 --> 00:30:40,200
didn't seem to have a problem so

724
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:44,200
genetics is a a really important factor

725
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:46,798
in whether it gets expressed um stress

726
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:49,720
is another thing that tends to bring out

727
00:30:46,798 --> 00:30:52,278
the symptoms um if your plants dry out

728
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:54,319
and then on accident and you water them

729
00:30:52,278 --> 00:30:56,960
the ones that don't seem to recover very

730
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:58,480
well they tend to be the ones that are

731
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,440
infected

732
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,399
um you know heat stress all those

733
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:06,278
different types of stress can also bring

734
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:09,319
it out um and then the level of viroid

735
00:31:06,278 --> 00:31:12,319
increases dramatically in the flower um

736
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:14,638
so during the flower stage so the stage

737
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:18,240
of growth is also going to be something

738
00:31:14,638 --> 00:31:21,199
where um that's going to bring out those

739
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:24,120
symptoms more um because the virid level

740
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:26,919
is going up at that

741
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:29,359
point are you

742
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:32,240
seeing I I I realize there's different

743
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:35,119
levels of vroid in the leaf tissue

744
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,960
versus The Roots but is there any

745
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:39,000
difference in let's say younger tissue

746
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,159
versus older tissue I would assume older

747
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,240
tissue would have higher higher vroid

748
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:44,799
loads

749
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,399
so like would would it be best practice

750
00:31:44,798 --> 00:31:48,798
for the Clones that we're keeping in

751
00:31:46,398 --> 00:31:53,879
theory to take those off the top of the

752
00:31:48,798 --> 00:31:56,638
plant versus lower down or growth right

753
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:59,320
so so when a virid enters the plant its

754
00:31:56,638 --> 00:32:02,278
movement is dictated by something called

755
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:04,480
source to sink which basically means it

756
00:32:02,278 --> 00:32:06,359
moves from where it was introduced to

757
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,919
parts of the plant that need energy

758
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:10,759
right so um it's obviously going to move

759
00:32:08,919 --> 00:32:13,559
towards New Growth because New Growth

760
00:32:10,759 --> 00:32:15,119
needs energy and it has to move to the

761
00:32:13,558 --> 00:32:17,839
root ball because the root ball doesn't

762
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:21,158
photosynthesize so it it's a huge sync

763
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:23,158
on the plant um so some of this is a

764
00:32:21,159 --> 00:32:25,159
little bit of a guess in game because

765
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:28,159
you don't really know when the plant was

766
00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:30,600
infected and you don't know um which

767
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:34,240
tissue represented a sink at the time

768
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:37,119
the plant was infected um when we did

769
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:39,359
this in our study we did find higher

770
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:41,558
vroid load in the older growth and

771
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:43,918
that's probably because when the plant

772
00:32:41,558 --> 00:32:46,240
was infected that growth was a syn

773
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:47,880
tissue and so it moved there and then

774
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:51,440
it's been replicating in there for a

775
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:53,519
while um but it it's it's a weird

776
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,679
guessing game because it really depends

777
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:58,038
on where the plant was initially

778
00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:01,360
infected and what tissues were sources

779
00:32:58,038 --> 00:33:03,000
and what tissues were SS at that time um

780
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:04,519
so I don't have a really good answer for

781
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,839
you I'm afraid because it it just kind

782
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:08,440
of depends on the how that plant was

783
00:33:06,839 --> 00:33:11,158
infected and the

784
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:12,440
timing no that's great I that's fine I

785
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:13,840
just wanted to know if if there was

786
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:16,720
something new that I hadn't heard about

787
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:19,918
that so that's that's wonderful

788
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:24,839
um what areas of the country are you

789
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:29,600
seeing hop latent the most and or other

790
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:32,558
pathogens in general just of curiosity

791
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:35,398
yes yeah absolutely so um so that's a

792
00:33:32,558 --> 00:33:37,359
it's a difficult question because um so

793
00:33:35,398 --> 00:33:39,558
obviously there's a lot of uh

794
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:42,439
cultivation facilities on the west coast

795
00:33:39,558 --> 00:33:45,319
and so a lot of people are testing and

796
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:47,759
so you have a lot of data um from you

797
00:33:45,319 --> 00:33:50,759
know California Colorado Oregon showing

798
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:53,240
that there's a lot of hop latent um we

799
00:33:50,759 --> 00:33:56,158
have customers all across the United

800
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:58,399
States and every single state in which

801
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:01,600
we were able to have an data to make the

802
00:33:58,398 --> 00:34:03,879
call we've detected hopl and vroid um so

803
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:06,278
I wouldn't say at this point that it's

804
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:09,679
more specific in any part of the country

805
00:34:06,278 --> 00:34:12,679
it's just kind of everywhere um we've

806
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:16,280
also detected it in Canada Thailand

807
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:19,079
South Africa all across Europe so it's

808
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:21,200
um it's just kind of a global pathogen

809
00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:23,720
at this point so it doesn't matter where

810
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:25,638
you're getting your stuff it's it's

811
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:27,959
something everybody is dealing with at

812
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:32,079
this point

813
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:34,960
I is it higher in any particular type of

814
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:37,919
media or style of growing like outdoor

815
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:40,838
versus indoor are you seeing it more in

816
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:42,679
uh chemical grows versus Organics uh

817
00:34:40,838 --> 00:34:46,000
anything like that at this point in time

818
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:48,358
or is it sort of agnostic and everywhere

819
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,838
it's I would definitely say it's

820
00:34:48,358 --> 00:34:53,799
agnostic um because it's it's an

821
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:57,838
intercellular pathogen it it cares a lot

822
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:59,839
less about like the media or the the

823
00:34:57,838 --> 00:35:02,078
environmental conditions as opposed to

824
00:34:59,838 --> 00:35:05,838
like big funguses or whatever that can

825
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:07,839
be impacted by a lot of those things um

826
00:35:05,838 --> 00:35:09,679
I would say it's I we don't see a huge

827
00:35:07,838 --> 00:35:12,239
difference we we definitely get less

828
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:15,519
data from outdoor grows um than we do

829
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:17,838
from indoor grows but um it's it's

830
00:35:15,519 --> 00:35:20,559
affecting all plants at this point no

831
00:35:17,838 --> 00:35:24,000
matter how how you're growing

832
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:26,078
them and so the only real method for

833
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,199
cleaning a plant right now that I'm

834
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:33,039
aware of is is like it's tissue culture

835
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:34,838
yes yeah so how effective is tissue

836
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:36,279
culture because you know it's something

837
00:35:34,838 --> 00:35:38,480
that we've been talking about for years

838
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:40,480
we see it in other Industries it seems

839
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:43,960
more challenging in cannabis for some

840
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:45,240
reason so what real world what's real

841
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:48,440
world like are you seeing a lot of

842
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:50,759
success there or is it proving to be

843
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:53,358
more challenging than people realize

844
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:57,079
yeah so it is possible to remove hop and

845
00:35:53,358 --> 00:35:59,078
vroid with tissue culture um the type of

846
00:35:57,079 --> 00:36:02,039
tissue culture that you have to do to

847
00:35:59,079 --> 00:36:06,280
remove it is um not a beginner's

848
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:10,599
procedure it's it's hard and it's not a

849
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:13,480
100% um and it definitely has um uh

850
00:36:10,599 --> 00:36:14,800
differences in cultivar the success rate

851
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:19,000
is different depending on which strain

852
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:20,720
you use um so we've definitely seen

853
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,760
companies that were able to do it and

854
00:36:20,719 --> 00:36:26,000
the plants have been clean for more than

855
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:27,599
a year and it was successful um and then

856
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,318
it just depends on the expertise of the

857
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:31,920
company that's doing it whether or not

858
00:36:29,318 --> 00:36:33,759
you know it's going to be successful um

859
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:36,079
it helps to submit plants for tissue

860
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:37,880
culture that have a lower fibroid load

861
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:39,400
if not I think one of the first steps

862
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:41,400
that they would take is to try to bring

863
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:42,400
that load down before they do the tissue

864
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:46,000
culture

865
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:48,720
process um and it takes a long time

866
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,800
because um you have to keep that plant

867
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:52,679
for a while and if they're doing it

868
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,560
right they're continually testing and

869
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:56,838
making sure that it was successful

870
00:36:54,559 --> 00:36:59,480
before they give it back to you um and

871
00:36:56,838 --> 00:37:02,960
that process like six months sometimes

872
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:04,838
even a year um just depending on you

873
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,880
know how high the viroid load was in the

874
00:37:04,838 --> 00:37:09,719
beginning and differences between

875
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:12,240
cultivars um so it definitely works if

876
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:14,439
you love a strain and you don't want to

877
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:16,598
lose it and it's willing you're willing

878
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:19,838
to give it the time and the money to

879
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:21,920
clean it you know um you can do it like

880
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:24,400
that it's just be aware it's a lengthy

881
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:25,800
process um and it's not I wouldn't

882
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,400
recommend someone just go out and get a

883
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:30,720
tissue culture hood and try to do it do

884
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:30,720
it it yourself because it's pretty

885
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:37,160
hard and

886
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:38,800
uh are there so I I don't know if I'm

887
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:40,318
just gonna ask you and then if you

888
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,880
choose not to answer it you can choose

889
00:37:40,318 --> 00:37:43,279
not to answer it but these companies

890
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,920
that you worked with that you saw good

891
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,440
success with are you comfortable naming

892
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:49,119
them to at least Point people in a

893
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:50,079
direction for going down that path if

894
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:54,200
they wish

895
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:56,200
to um yes if you guys send me an email I

896
00:37:54,199 --> 00:37:58,838
will happy I'll give you the the names

897
00:37:56,199 --> 00:38:00,960
how about that um it's so just send us a

898
00:37:58,838 --> 00:38:02,920
message we do we don't we don't get a

899
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,240
kickback it's not like a monetary thing

900
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:06,240
I just know there are some companies

901
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:09,039
that do really good science and they're

902
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:10,598
very rigorous um and so um if you guys

903
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:12,318
want to know feel free to send me a

904
00:38:10,599 --> 00:38:15,039
message and and we're happy to give you

905
00:38:12,318 --> 00:38:18,960
some recommendations on that okay fair

906
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:22,880
enough okay well let's let's kind of

907
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:25,880
switch Direction here sure so Tumi has

908
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:31,039
developed a

909
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:33,358
onsite so like field sort of hlvd

910
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:34,599
testing platform is that correct or why

911
00:38:33,358 --> 00:38:36,199
don't you talk about it because it's

912
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:37,640
your it's your product let's talk a

913
00:38:36,199 --> 00:38:39,239
little about how it might work and and

914
00:38:37,639 --> 00:38:42,598
what the the benefits are for Growers

915
00:38:39,239 --> 00:38:44,519
that are interested yes absolutely so um

916
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:47,640
you're correct we have created an

917
00:38:44,519 --> 00:38:51,000
on-site testing platform um and our goal

918
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:53,440
with that was um to provide Growers with

919
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:56,000
similar sensitivity and accuracy as an

920
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:58,079
in-lab PCR but kind of give them the

921
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,719
power so they can run the test

922
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:04,079
themselves they can see the results you

923
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:06,598
know like after an hour or two and and

924
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:11,000
make decisions that will help maintain

925
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:14,440
the efficiency of their facility um so

926
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:16,960
the test itself is um it's a version of

927
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:19,400
isothermal amplification but we've made

928
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:21,440
a lot of changes to sort of the base

929
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:23,200
technology um because what we wanted to

930
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:25,838
provide the Canabis facility was not

931
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:27,919
just an on-site test that works but

932
00:39:25,838 --> 00:39:30,279
something that really pushes the limits

933
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:32,760
of what's possible with that type of

934
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:34,800
Technology um so we've been able to

935
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:36,720
incorporate um I think probably one of

936
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:41,000
the most critical things is an internal

937
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:43,719
control so what that means is if you run

938
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:46,559
the test and there was a mistake made or

939
00:39:43,719 --> 00:39:48,000
the tissue wasn't any good or maybe the

940
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:50,679
reagents weren't good or whatever the

941
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,719
test will fail so you won't get a false

942
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:54,480
negative and have that false sense of

943
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:57,598
security you'll know that that needs to

944
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:59,480
be rerun um if it if it's negative

945
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:01,079
you'll get the you'll get a green the

946
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,719
test will glow green and if it's

947
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:05,359
positive it'll glow somewhere between a

948
00:40:02,719 --> 00:40:09,118
yellow to a red kind of uh depending on

949
00:40:05,358 --> 00:40:11,440
vroid load um the other ways that we've

950
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:14,119
changed the chemistry have allowed us to

951
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:17,400
bring that sensitivity to an incredibly

952
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:20,280
high level so we're able to detect four

953
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:25,599
bid particles per microl ler um which

954
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:29,880
comes in uh more than 95 96% of all the

955
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:32,640
tests that we find with um qpcr in laab

956
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:34,800
high complexity would also be detected

957
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:37,078
by this technology so it gives you the

958
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:39,359
confidence that if you get a negative

959
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:41,000
result with that level of sensitivity

960
00:40:39,358 --> 00:40:42,838
and the the fact that you can tell the

961
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,199
difference between a failed test and a

962
00:40:42,838 --> 00:40:47,719
negative test that you can feel pretty

963
00:40:45,199 --> 00:40:50,000
confident that that plant is actually

964
00:40:47,719 --> 00:40:54,838
negative or at least the tissue that you

965
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:56,719
detected is or Collective is negative um

966
00:40:54,838 --> 00:41:00,000
the other thing that we tried really

967
00:40:56,719 --> 00:41:02,039
hard on was to make this easy um because

968
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,800
Growers aren't molecular biologists I

969
00:41:02,039 --> 00:41:05,920
don't expect you to know how to use a

970
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:09,079
pipet or know what the difference is

971
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:12,039
between 10 microliters and 100 um so

972
00:41:09,079 --> 00:41:15,318
we've taken all the complexity out it's

973
00:41:12,039 --> 00:41:17,519
um very easy to use there's no pipets

974
00:41:15,318 --> 00:41:20,639
there's no scientific knowledge the

975
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:22,079
sample prep is is all integrated into

976
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:23,598
the tube so you put some root in the

977
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:25,519
tube you close the lid you shake it up

978
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:27,920
just like our in-lab test and then it's

979
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:31,759
ready to be run in the test

980
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:35,318
so it's not hard at all to use and it

981
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:37,359
comes with um a device that calls the

982
00:41:35,318 --> 00:41:39,639
results for you so there's no ambiguity

983
00:41:37,358 --> 00:41:41,239
there whether it's positive negative or

984
00:41:39,639 --> 00:41:43,400
oh maybe it kind of changed color or

985
00:41:41,239 --> 00:41:46,039
it's glowing a little bit the device

986
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:48,280
will tell you the results and um it

987
00:41:46,039 --> 00:41:51,519
comes with a soft a software that will

988
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:54,000
give you a dashboard so um not only will

989
00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:56,519
you get the results they'll be organized

990
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,679
digitally um and it'll track positivity

991
00:41:56,519 --> 00:42:02,119
for you over time you can sort it by

992
00:41:58,679 --> 00:42:04,118
room by strain by user by facility and

993
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:06,400
you have something to you know if you if

994
00:42:04,119 --> 00:42:08,200
you need to send reports off you have

995
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:11,000
something that you can print out to show

996
00:42:08,199 --> 00:42:13,838
them how the facility is doing uh with

997
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:17,119
their pathogen prevention program um you

998
00:42:13,838 --> 00:42:19,599
can also print the reports out um and

999
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:21,760
give them to customers if they're buying

1000
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:24,280
your clones or your seeds to show them

1001
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:25,920
that you've tested um and and it has all

1002
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:27,920
of the results in there so that you can

1003
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:31,000
give your customers that extra

1004
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:33,358
confidence so um yeah we' we've tried

1005
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:36,159
our very best to build a system that's

1006
00:42:33,358 --> 00:42:37,920
accurate sensitive easy to use and

1007
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:40,318
provides the type of convenience that I

1008
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:42,800
think Growers need in order for it to be

1009
00:42:40,318 --> 00:42:44,480
something that they um can help them

1010
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,880
economically and they can utilize in

1011
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,920
their

1012
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:49,318
facility that's great you answered a lot

1013
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:52,280
of the questions I was going to ask you

1014
00:42:49,318 --> 00:42:54,519
about this um so that was wonderful so I

1015
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:56,640
don't have to be a scientist to use the

1016
00:42:54,519 --> 00:42:59,358
product I could just a little bit of

1017
00:42:56,639 --> 00:43:03,039
training um yep and and I could do it

1018
00:42:59,358 --> 00:43:07,838
that's great um how long does it take

1019
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:09,358
for me to say take a sample of root and

1020
00:43:07,838 --> 00:43:13,400
run the whole run through the whole

1021
00:43:09,358 --> 00:43:15,480
process and get a get a result yeah so

1022
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:17,519
um so to collect the root we've timed

1023
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:21,318
ourselves when you get pretty good at it

1024
00:43:17,519 --> 00:43:24,880
you can do it in about 30 seconds um

1025
00:43:21,318 --> 00:43:27,920
it's we we ask that people take a four

1026
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:30,760
pieces of root about an inch long um cut

1027
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:33,000
it in half put it in the tube um so that

1028
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:36,720
takes it depends on the root system

1029
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:39,239
obviously 30 seconds maybe per plant um

1030
00:43:36,719 --> 00:43:41,358
then you shake it up and you move 40

1031
00:43:39,239 --> 00:43:43,598
microliters of liquid using this the

1032
00:43:41,358 --> 00:43:46,719
specialized uh transfer stick that we

1033
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:50,680
provide into the reaction so you can do

1034
00:43:46,719 --> 00:43:54,239
an entire plate um of of that in maybe

1035
00:43:50,679 --> 00:43:56,078
20 minutes um and then it sits in the

1036
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:58,358
heat block for 90 minutes but that's

1037
00:43:56,079 --> 00:44:00,119
downtime for you um you hit start you

1038
00:43:58,358 --> 00:44:02,078
can walk away you can go to lunch you

1039
00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:03,880
can do whatever else you need to do and

1040
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:07,760
it beeps and turns itself off when it's

1041
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:09,440
done um then the analysis bit you can do

1042
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:13,680
um an entire plate

1043
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:15,760
takes maybe a minute at the most um so

1044
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:18,679
it kind of depends on how many people

1045
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:20,440
you have collecting samples but Hands-On

1046
00:44:18,679 --> 00:44:22,799
time for an entire

1047
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:26,358
plate

1048
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:28,039
maybe two hours two hours okay would you

1049
00:44:26,358 --> 00:44:29,799
say an entire plate that means you're

1050
00:44:28,039 --> 00:44:32,400
running multiple samples at the same

1051
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:34,720
time is that yes what you're referencing

1052
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:38,200
yes yeah so the plates hold 48 samples

1053
00:44:34,719 --> 00:44:40,000
at a time and um that's only limited by

1054
00:44:38,199 --> 00:44:41,519
the number of heat blocks you have so if

1055
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:45,199
you have four heat blocks then you could

1056
00:44:41,519 --> 00:44:46,960
do four times as many simultaneously so

1057
00:44:45,199 --> 00:44:49,598
by far the most timec consuming part of

1058
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:51,800
this is actually just sample collection

1059
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:54,160
um and that's would be the same if you

1060
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:56,599
were doing an in-lab test that's that's

1061
00:44:54,159 --> 00:45:00,679
the part that takes uh the most time but

1062
00:44:56,599 --> 00:45:02,039
running the test itself um is is minimal

1063
00:45:00,679 --> 00:45:04,279
time commitment once you have those

1064
00:45:02,039 --> 00:45:08,199
samples

1065
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:10,720
collected so could I run say six tests

1066
00:45:08,199 --> 00:45:13,279
at a time though and save the other 42

1067
00:45:10,719 --> 00:45:15,199
to run another cycle yes on the

1068
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:17,280
absolutely you can run one test all the

1069
00:45:15,199 --> 00:45:20,039
way up to you know multiple plates at

1070
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:21,599
once it's just depends on what you need

1071
00:45:20,039 --> 00:45:23,000
okay because people are gonna these I'm

1072
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:24,880
trying to ask all the questions I think

1073
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,760
people might ask uh after listening to

1074
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:28,280
the podcast and I'm I know people are

1075
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:29,839
going to want to know what is this cost

1076
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:31,880
so we should probably talk about that

1077
00:45:29,838 --> 00:45:33,920
just to get it out of the way uh for

1078
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:36,318
folks that are interested um I'm looking

1079
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:37,720
at the pricing here but do you w to do

1080
00:45:36,318 --> 00:45:39,000
you want to tackle that and kind of

1081
00:45:37,719 --> 00:45:41,358
cover that or do you want me to just

1082
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:44,318
sure absolutely yeah okay so so there's

1083
00:45:41,358 --> 00:45:46,239
a one-time cost for the device itself

1084
00:45:44,318 --> 00:45:49,000
that's around

1085
00:45:46,239 --> 00:45:50,679
4,800 um and that's only paid once and

1086
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,400
that comes with the device the heat

1087
00:45:50,679 --> 00:45:54,838
block um all the trays and everything to

1088
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:57,480
sort of help with the

1089
00:45:54,838 --> 00:46:00,279
organization um the reaction

1090
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:03,119
themselves uh range between $10 up to

1091
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:06,160
$18 and uh per reaction and that just

1092
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:08,920
depends on bulk at that point um how

1093
00:46:06,159 --> 00:46:11,519
many reactions you want to buy um at

1094
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:13,159
once and obviously the the $18 is the

1095
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:15,880
high price but it comes down pretty

1096
00:46:13,159 --> 00:46:18,440
quickly if you buy you know a 100

1097
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:22,119
reactions or or 200 reactions and it

1098
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:25,800
keeps going down like that

1099
00:46:22,119 --> 00:46:28,280
um yeah that's that's the cost there um

1100
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:30,318
the the device hopefully we'll be

1101
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:31,880
detecting multiple pathogens soon so

1102
00:46:30,318 --> 00:46:33,159
then there'll be multiple kits that you

1103
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:35,680
could

1104
00:46:33,159 --> 00:46:37,358
purchase so it looks like the like you

1105
00:46:35,679 --> 00:46:41,078
said the starter kit

1106
00:46:37,358 --> 00:46:42,759
4775 uh us for the starter kit and that

1107
00:46:41,079 --> 00:46:45,920
comes with the device collection two

1108
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:48,480
Brack and two reaction two bracks and a

1109
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:52,079
dry bath and WiFi adapter are the

1110
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:54,159
components Y and then the testing kit it

1111
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:57,960
looks like the minimum size is

1112
00:46:54,159 --> 00:46:59,639
$864 which works out to $18 a for 48

1113
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:02,440
kits which you said you don't have to

1114
00:46:59,639 --> 00:47:04,480
use all at once correct and then you

1115
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:05,920
mentioned bulk options uh my question

1116
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:07,719
there is like how long could I store

1117
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:11,000
this stuff and how am I storing these

1118
00:47:07,719 --> 00:47:13,959
reaction kits if I wanted to like stock

1119
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:16,039
up to save money for example yes yeah so

1120
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:17,679
they um so you can store them for six

1121
00:47:16,039 --> 00:47:19,679
months if you pop them in the fridge

1122
00:47:17,679 --> 00:47:22,480
they're more stable in the fridge than

1123
00:47:19,679 --> 00:47:25,000
they would be um on the counter if you

1124
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:27,079
have some freezer space so just the

1125
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,679
reactions themselves are very little so

1126
00:47:27,079 --> 00:47:32,119
you can take the reactions out of the

1127
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:33,558
box and put them in the freezer then um

1128
00:47:32,119 --> 00:47:36,079
it's almost indefinite you can keep them

1129
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:38,880
for up to a year um and they're fine in

1130
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:40,640
the freezer so um it depends on what

1131
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,039
kind of storage options you have but if

1132
00:47:40,639 --> 00:47:45,480
you have like a little mini fridge or a

1133
00:47:42,039 --> 00:47:48,119
mini freezer you can stock up uh quite a

1134
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:50,519
few when you say indefinite what's my

1135
00:47:48,119 --> 00:47:53,079
range between a year and indefinite of

1136
00:47:50,519 --> 00:47:55,239
probably having kits that are still good

1137
00:47:53,079 --> 00:47:56,839
yeah okay so that's a great question um

1138
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:59,239
so I wouldn't recommend keeping them for

1139
00:47:56,838 --> 00:48:02,558
for more than a year but the accelerated

1140
00:47:59,239 --> 00:48:04,199
stability studies that we did showed

1141
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:06,440
that even if you keep them for a year in

1142
00:48:04,199 --> 00:48:09,639
the fridge we didn't see any decrease in

1143
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:11,838
sensitivity um so I wouldn't I would try

1144
00:48:09,639 --> 00:48:13,558
to use them up within the year but um

1145
00:48:11,838 --> 00:48:15,279
the data we have doesn't suggest that

1146
00:48:13,559 --> 00:48:18,319
they would be bad if you use them after

1147
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:22,480
13 months is the issue sensitivity or is

1148
00:48:18,318 --> 00:48:26,480
the issue potential uh kit failure where

1149
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:28,199
just you get a a failed message back

1150
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:30,000
like if you keep it for too long you

1151
00:48:28,199 --> 00:48:31,598
mean yeah would the kit just

1152
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,639
automatically F I'm thinking of a covid

1153
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:37,160
test for example

1154
00:48:33,639 --> 00:48:39,318
um yeah so it's so it's both um so the

1155
00:48:37,159 --> 00:48:40,838
way that you do these accelerated

1156
00:48:39,318 --> 00:48:42,880
stability studies is you kind of heat

1157
00:48:40,838 --> 00:48:44,639
them up to a higher temperature and then

1158
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:46,838
you push the test to its limit of

1159
00:48:44,639 --> 00:48:49,159
detection and ask how long can it sit

1160
00:48:46,838 --> 00:48:52,119
and still capture you know near the

1161
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:56,798
sensitivity that that it has when when

1162
00:48:52,119 --> 00:48:58,720
it's new um so you can also increase the

1163
00:48:56,798 --> 00:49:01,318
number of fails if some components of

1164
00:48:58,719 --> 00:49:02,838
the test aren't working as well so the

1165
00:49:01,318 --> 00:49:05,000
first thing you would see is sort of a

1166
00:49:02,838 --> 00:49:06,880
decrease in sensitivity and then you

1167
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:09,079
might see um a higher percentage of

1168
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:11,358
fails also if you push it past the

1169
00:49:09,079 --> 00:49:14,720
expiration

1170
00:49:11,358 --> 00:49:16,400
date okay and you have uh it looks like

1171
00:49:14,719 --> 00:49:18,519
publicly available data on this that

1172
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:21,079
people can really dive into that are

1173
00:49:18,519 --> 00:49:24,639
interested in learning more um I want to

1174
00:49:21,079 --> 00:49:27,880
just touch on a couple things here uh

1175
00:49:24,639 --> 00:49:30,838
I'm looking at a graph or that or a

1176
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:33,559
table sorry that shows

1177
00:49:30,838 --> 00:49:36,960
um

1178
00:49:33,559 --> 00:49:40,240
the uh percent detection success based

1179
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:43,400
on hlvd concentration in the

1180
00:49:40,239 --> 00:49:46,279
sample can you talk a little bit about

1181
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:48,079
about what that what that graph or table

1182
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:50,880
is showing yes you know what I'm

1183
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:52,880
referencing so yes absolutely so um the

1184
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:55,880
way that you determine the sensitivity

1185
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:57,240
of one of these molecular tests is that

1186
00:49:55,880 --> 00:50:00,079
you um

1187
00:49:57,239 --> 00:50:02,399
you create a gradient of vroid amount

1188
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:05,200
from a whole bunch to um all the way

1189
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:07,000
down to basically nothing um and then

1190
00:50:05,199 --> 00:50:09,078
you do a bunch of tests in each of the

1191
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:11,920
different levels and you need to show

1192
00:50:09,079 --> 00:50:15,039
that you have uh 95%

1193
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:19,000
success of detection in order to find

1194
00:50:15,039 --> 00:50:20,679
that range where um the test uh is is

1195
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,798
works and then the range where it kind

1196
00:50:20,679 --> 00:50:25,440
of falls out so um and that's that's

1197
00:50:23,798 --> 00:50:27,679
exactly the way it's done if you're

1198
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:29,760
trying to do a human diagnos IC or a

1199
00:50:27,679 --> 00:50:31,639
diagnostic in any other industry where

1200
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:35,119
these types of things are standard and

1201
00:50:31,639 --> 00:50:37,920
required um so that's what we did we ran

1202
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:40,480
uh 20 or 30 tests at multiple different

1203
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:43,079
levels of vroid and we pushed it until

1204
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:45,358
we hit uh the point where we got that

1205
00:50:43,079 --> 00:50:47,880
95% success but we pushed it a little

1206
00:50:45,358 --> 00:50:50,078
more and we went down um I think it was

1207
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:52,318
80 then 50 and then we lost it or

1208
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:55,280
something like that um so that's how you

1209
00:50:52,318 --> 00:50:57,318
kind of determine that that that special

1210
00:50:55,280 --> 00:51:00,880
Zone where where you can can detect down

1211
00:50:57,318 --> 00:51:02,798
to that level with 95% confidence um and

1212
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:04,880
so for us it was four vroid particles

1213
00:51:02,798 --> 00:51:07,000
per microliter when we went down to two

1214
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:10,640
and one you can still find it now and

1215
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:13,400
then it's just not 95% uh confidence or

1216
00:51:10,639 --> 00:51:15,679
95% success or

1217
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:18,400
better and then you did other tests

1218
00:51:15,679 --> 00:51:20,000
looking at different organisms um I'm

1219
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:24,559
looking at the list here it's quite

1220
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:27,358
extensive notably pythium Bettis ronia

1221
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:30,200
ferium um all of these different

1222
00:51:27,358 --> 00:51:32,078
these different organisms and cross

1223
00:51:30,199 --> 00:51:34,199
reactivity and then you have a variety

1224
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:36,798
of percentages can you explain what I'm

1225
00:51:34,199 --> 00:51:39,239
looking at to me here in terms of uh

1226
00:51:36,798 --> 00:51:41,719
what these percentages really mean yes

1227
00:51:39,239 --> 00:51:44,118
absolutely yeah so for this test we did

1228
00:51:41,719 --> 00:51:46,318
the um the cross reactivity and

1229
00:51:44,119 --> 00:51:47,960
interference both in that table that

1230
00:51:46,318 --> 00:51:50,159
you're looking at which is a a

1231
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:52,480
bioinformatic analysis and then we did a

1232
00:51:50,159 --> 00:51:55,239
wet lab analysis so for the

1233
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:57,880
bioinformatic analysis you take the

1234
00:51:55,239 --> 00:52:00,919
sequences um that are used in the test

1235
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:02,960
to find hopl and vroid and the idea is

1236
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:04,880
you want those sequences to find hopl

1237
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:07,199
and vroid but you don't want them to

1238
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:10,039
find any other pathogens that might be

1239
00:52:07,199 --> 00:52:13,279
present or the Cannabis genome itself

1240
00:52:10,039 --> 00:52:15,679
right so you look through the Genome of

1241
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:17,440
each of these different organisms um and

1242
00:52:15,679 --> 00:52:21,159
you make sure that the sequences you're

1243
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:23,760
using to find top latent wouldn't also

1244
00:52:21,159 --> 00:52:27,118
find those organisms so those

1245
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:30,000
percentages are the the the highest

1246
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:32,318
percent overlap between the sequences

1247
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:34,039
we're using to find hop latent and all

1248
00:52:32,318 --> 00:52:37,558
of those other organisms that we've

1249
00:52:34,039 --> 00:52:39,920
looked at and so the bar there is 80%

1250
00:52:37,559 --> 00:52:42,880
that's the bar set by the FDA if you go

1251
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:45,440
below 80% then it it's not

1252
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:48,680
bioinformatically predicted to cross

1253
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:50,798
react um the other thing we did was a

1254
00:52:48,679 --> 00:52:52,679
wet lab analysis so that's where we just

1255
00:52:50,798 --> 00:52:55,719
actually took that organism and we put

1256
00:52:52,679 --> 00:52:58,639
it in a tube with the test and said okay

1257
00:52:55,719 --> 00:53:01,318
do we a find it if we don't add hopl and

1258
00:52:58,639 --> 00:53:04,318
vroid and B does it interfere with the

1259
00:53:01,318 --> 00:53:06,119
detection of hopl and vroid um when hopl

1260
00:53:04,318 --> 00:53:09,119
and viid is really low but there's like

1261
00:53:06,119 --> 00:53:11,760
tons of ferium orium um and both of

1262
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:14,480
those are very important um so we we

1263
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:17,960
didn't find any um interference or cross

1264
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:20,679
reactivity in our wet lab tests

1265
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:23,400
either great so if I had a plant with

1266
00:53:20,679 --> 00:53:25,318
fusarium or media with fusarium and I

1267
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:27,480
pulled a root out of there I should

1268
00:53:25,318 --> 00:53:29,599
still get an accurate test or tricoderma

1269
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:31,599
pythium you list a whole bunch of

1270
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:35,039
different uh

1271
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:37,640
pathogens um in there so okay great you

1272
00:53:35,039 --> 00:53:40,759
answered that question uh last question

1273
00:53:37,639 --> 00:53:42,679
I had was uh interfering substance

1274
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:46,160
studies that you did so looking at

1275
00:53:42,679 --> 00:53:48,358
growing medium yes can you touch on that

1276
00:53:46,159 --> 00:53:51,199
yes absolutely so um to me this is one

1277
00:53:48,358 --> 00:53:53,880
of the most important analyses because

1278
00:53:51,199 --> 00:53:56,078
um Growers use a lot of different inputs

1279
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:59,079
and I think the big question is I just

1280
00:53:56,079 --> 00:54:01,318
spr sulfur on my plants or I got some

1281
00:53:59,079 --> 00:54:04,559
cocoa in the tube or I you know I use

1282
00:54:01,318 --> 00:54:08,480
soil is it going to interfere with this

1283
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:10,240
test and so we set out to ask that of of

1284
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:12,599
a ton of different substances that

1285
00:54:10,239 --> 00:54:14,639
people might use from IPM substances to

1286
00:54:12,599 --> 00:54:15,640
different growing mediums to different

1287
00:54:14,639 --> 00:54:18,318
types of

1288
00:54:15,639 --> 00:54:20,159
sterilization um and identified the ones

1289
00:54:18,318 --> 00:54:23,440
where used at an incredibly High

1290
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:26,039
concentration do interfere um there were

1291
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:28,159
a few a lot of them didn't interfere um

1292
00:54:26,039 --> 00:54:30,920
the one that did interfere we did

1293
00:54:28,159 --> 00:54:33,318
follow-up studies to see what level the

1294
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:35,920
interference would begin um and then we

1295
00:54:33,318 --> 00:54:39,000
can formulate recommendations uh for

1296
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:41,559
example soil tends to interfere it soil

1297
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:43,480
has a lot of PCR Inhibitors so if you

1298
00:54:41,559 --> 00:54:45,680
have large amounts of soil on the roots

1299
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:48,599
just for soil specifically we recommend

1300
00:54:45,679 --> 00:54:50,519
people you know wipe that soil off or or

1301
00:54:48,599 --> 00:54:54,318
clean it in some water before putting in

1302
00:54:50,519 --> 00:54:57,199
the tests um but it's important that you

1303
00:54:54,318 --> 00:54:59,880
do all of those studies so Growers know

1304
00:54:57,199 --> 00:55:02,439
oh I just used this particular product

1305
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:04,200
can I still do this or do I have to wait

1306
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:05,599
and so we tried really hard to think of

1307
00:55:04,199 --> 00:55:08,279
everything that might be in the root

1308
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:10,359
Zone and then make sure that um it

1309
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:12,798
wouldn't interfere or if it did we

1310
00:55:10,358 --> 00:55:14,119
provide advice on on when to test the

1311
00:55:12,798 --> 00:55:15,960
plant so they're not testing it and

1312
00:55:14,119 --> 00:55:17,680
getting a bunch of fails and having to

1313
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:20,720
do it

1314
00:55:17,679 --> 00:55:23,000
again awesome and I realize ultimately

1315
00:55:20,719 --> 00:55:24,959
this product is not going to be for

1316
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,719
everyone you know it's more specific to

1317
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:29,000
people growing on a pretty large large

1318
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:31,279
scale uh to make it worth it to do this

1319
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:33,159
level of testing but I hope that folks

1320
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:34,640
that tuned in um even hom Growers

1321
00:55:33,159 --> 00:55:36,480
learned a little bit more about top late

1322
00:55:34,639 --> 00:55:39,639
en viroid and pathogens in general and

1323
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:41,838
can take that back into their grow grow

1324
00:55:39,639 --> 00:55:44,038
system and and make improvements as well

1325
