00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:20,698
welcome to the cannabis cultivation in

3
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:22,979
science podcast

4
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:25,109
I'm your host tad hussy of KISS organics

5
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,849
this is the podcast where we discussed

6
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:28,830
the cutting edge of organic growing from

7
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:30,809
a science-based perspective and drawn

8
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:32,820
top experts from around the industry to

9
00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:34,799
share their wisdom and knowledge this

10
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,149
podcast was a fun one for me because we

11
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:38,429
got to talk about some of the challenges

12
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:40,710
around research in cannabis how to

13
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:42,509
interpret that research a recent white

14
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,429
paper comparing single plant versus

15
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:47,579
communal plant systems and soils and

16
00:00:44,429 --> 00:00:50,128
also announced a new partnership my

17
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:51,989
guest this week is Ben Higgins Ben

18
00:00:50,128 --> 00:00:53,460
earned his PhD in ecology and

19
00:00:51,988 --> 00:00:56,159
evolutionary biology from the University

20
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,558
of California Santa Cruz where he

21
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:01,288
studied functional ecology organism all

22
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:03,209
morphometrics and physiology he is the

23
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:04,978
chief research scientist at gold leaf

24
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,719
gardens where he collects data on

25
00:01:04,978 --> 00:01:08,819
various topics in coordination with

26
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:11,099
multiple companies representing all

27
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:13,109
corners of the cannabis industry Ben

28
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:15,329
works alongside their experienced staff

29
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:17,549
to refine research and develop new

30
00:01:15,329 --> 00:01:19,590
methods and organic cannabis cultivation

31
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:21,509
he lives in Olympia Washington with his

32
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:22,950
wife and two daughters and loves to

33
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:25,890
explore the natural beauty of the area

34
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:31,670
with them as often as possible now on to

35
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:34,739
the show hey Ben welcome to the show

36
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:35,700
thanks dad ledger to be here yeah let's

37
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:37,379
start off by letting and telling

38
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,909
listeners a little bit about you and

39
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:42,868
your background and how you ended up

40
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:45,329
over at gold leaf gardens sure so just

41
00:01:42,868 --> 00:01:47,040
kind of like everything else has been so

42
00:01:45,328 --> 00:01:49,919
far in my life nothing's really exactly

43
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:54,750
linear most of my background actually

44
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:56,670
comes from marine based research so this

45
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:58,500
all kind of started out back really in

46
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:01,439
my undergrad that I did at Pitzer

47
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:03,750
College I went abroad to the Great

48
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:06,148
Barrier Reef and stayed there for five

49
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:09,090
weeks and did a bunch of independent

50
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:12,239
study work and you know just live in the

51
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,650
the island life and had a blast and and

52
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,688
really just got hooked on

53
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:19,590
and kind of studying the natural world

54
00:02:15,688 --> 00:02:21,650
and as that was my first experience with

55
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:24,269
it I kind of just gravitated towards

56
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:27,599
marine life you know XE ology so

57
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:29,400
studying fishes and you know I was

58
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:31,500
living still and going to college still

59
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,629
in California so coral reefs really

60
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,750
weren't you know that available to keep

61
00:02:33,628 --> 00:02:40,078
working on when I got home but kelp

62
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:45,109
forests were right outside the back door

63
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:47,700
and I eventually got linked up with a

64
00:02:45,109 --> 00:02:51,680
principal investigator up at UC Santa

65
00:02:47,699 --> 00:02:54,959
Cruz and did my dissertation on

66
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:59,609
California moray eels and really kind of

67
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:01,759
evolved myself into what is kind of

68
00:02:59,609 --> 00:03:03,930
described as a functional ecologist and

69
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:07,019
what that means is really it's just

70
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:09,480
about understanding the organisms in a

71
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:14,310
system and how they interact with that

72
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:18,268
system and with each other so I then

73
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:20,459
kind of took a big shift and moved once

74
00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:22,530
I finished my program moved up here to

75
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:26,609
Olympia and started working at gold leaf

76
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:28,289
where it was it was fun it was it was a

77
00:03:26,609 --> 00:03:30,209
little bit of a challenge to take things

78
00:03:28,289 --> 00:03:33,120
that were happening kind of on a larger

79
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:35,069
scale underwater and starting to try to

80
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,840
figure out how to apply those to much

81
00:03:35,068 --> 00:03:39,988
smaller things that were happening in

82
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:42,359
the soils so instead of looking at a

83
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:45,319
bunch of different fishes and what they

84
00:03:42,359 --> 00:03:47,790
ate and how those species interacted I

85
00:03:45,318 --> 00:03:49,888
started to kind of shift my focus to

86
00:03:47,789 --> 00:03:54,060
these things that you'd find in soils

87
00:03:49,889 --> 00:03:56,549
right so bacteria all those other small

88
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:58,199
little you know things that are moving

89
00:03:56,549 --> 00:04:00,750
around in there and some of the bigger

90
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:04,290
things and just looking at the trophic

91
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:06,359
interactions there and learning that

92
00:04:04,289 --> 00:04:09,448
these are all kind of dials that you can

93
00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:14,010
really kind of turn and then your

94
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:16,109
results aren't necessarily the species

95
00:04:14,009 --> 00:04:19,079
interaction themselves but the plants as

96
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:23,278
an indicator of those interactions right

97
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:25,860
so your healthy plant is going to be a

98
00:04:23,278 --> 00:04:27,029
great measuring stick on of the biology

99
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:29,580
that's happening you know

100
00:04:27,029 --> 00:04:32,489
beneath them mr. biologies looking great

101
00:04:29,579 --> 00:04:34,319
then you're gonna see that results as a

102
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:37,410
healthy plant if the biology under there

103
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:41,040
is imbalanced or the diversity is low or

104
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:43,530
not so healthy then you'll see that kind

105
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:46,770
of manifest in the plant so it was

106
00:04:43,529 --> 00:04:50,279
really a cool system to kind of you know

107
00:04:46,769 --> 00:04:52,139
moved into and I'm still learning as I

108
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:54,049
go and that's why I still love doing

109
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:57,689
this stuff is I just keep learning and

110
00:04:54,050 --> 00:05:00,329
you know expanding and that's how I kind

111
00:04:57,689 --> 00:05:01,860
of ended up at gold leaf now when you

112
00:05:00,329 --> 00:05:04,168
came into gold leaf you didn't have any

113
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:07,230
experience growing cannabis is that

114
00:05:04,168 --> 00:05:09,899
correct that's correct I I had some

115
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:12,480
experience growing plants beyond just

116
00:05:09,899 --> 00:05:16,979
you know I wanted some tomatoes for my

117
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:19,710
salad I I did do a what years and years

118
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:23,280
ago I did a little bit of a an

119
00:05:19,709 --> 00:05:25,469
internship at a nursery down in Southern

120
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:29,339
California but I was taking care of

121
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:31,260
things like coastal live oaks and you

122
00:05:29,339 --> 00:05:33,478
know you're kind of the endemic species

123
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:37,649
down there the native species down there

124
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:39,959
and nothing even remotely close to

125
00:05:37,649 --> 00:05:42,239
cannabis production so what I think's

126
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:45,089
interesting is with your background

127
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:48,030
being in science and scientific research

128
00:05:45,089 --> 00:05:51,269
it really gave you a good a good head

129
00:05:48,029 --> 00:05:54,929
start and understanding sort of how to

130
00:05:51,269 --> 00:05:58,500
approach data collection in a facility

131
00:05:54,930 --> 00:06:00,288
like like gold leaf so I guess what I

132
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,490
would wonder what I wonder from you is

133
00:06:00,288 --> 00:06:05,370
given your background and as you came

134
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:07,079
into this whole thing what what were you

135
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:09,090
finding were some of the challenges

136
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:11,459
around data collection and what were

137
00:06:09,089 --> 00:06:14,969
some of the metrics that you found were

138
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:16,829
really important in evaluating you sort

139
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:19,979
of the you know the business overall or

140
00:06:16,829 --> 00:06:21,478
the health of the plants right so it I

141
00:06:19,978 --> 00:06:24,449
got kind of lucky because of the way

142
00:06:21,478 --> 00:06:27,990
Gold Leafs facilities set up its

143
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:31,620
basically seven replicate rooms and to a

144
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:34,350
scientist replicates are a gold mine

145
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:36,269
right because then you can start playing

146
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:37,919
with different things and you know

147
00:06:36,269 --> 00:06:39,949
different variables and then holding

148
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:41,719
other variables constant and if you

149
00:06:39,949 --> 00:06:45,139
do that across multiple different rooms

150
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:48,380
that are identical you can start to get

151
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:51,169
a lot of power to really you know figure

152
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:54,350
out what's what's going on the first

153
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:57,439
time I saw the goldleaf facility I was I

154
00:06:54,350 --> 00:07:00,650
was like oh my gosh this is this is you

155
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:03,740
know a functioning laboratory as much as

156
00:07:00,649 --> 00:07:07,429
it is a functioning you know cannabis

157
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:10,550
facility and I told that to Nate Gibbs

158
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:12,410
the owner there and he was very

159
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:14,660
interested in and you know having me

160
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:17,270
come on and you know try to you know

161
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:20,810
turn some of these dials and and and get

162
00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:23,599
down to researching this as far as the

163
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:26,540
challenges are concerned this is all

164
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:29,840
coming because coming from the the fact

165
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:33,710
that I just spent six years kind of

166
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:36,589
working at my own pace you know kind of

167
00:07:33,709 --> 00:07:38,539
investigating any lead that I might find

168
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:41,089
interesting

169
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:43,730
you know just chasing the rabbit down

170
00:07:41,089 --> 00:07:45,949
whichever hole you know the questions or

171
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:47,509
the data might lead you but when you're

172
00:07:45,949 --> 00:07:49,789
working within the you know the

173
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:52,370
guidelines of a facility you know you

174
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:53,720
need to kind of navigate that a little

175
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:56,090
bit differently right because you can't

176
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,710
just say like well you know to answer

177
00:07:56,089 --> 00:07:59,000
this question I'm going to need six

178
00:07:57,709 --> 00:08:00,549
years and I don't know where it's going

179
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,639
to go right that's not a sustainable

180
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:06,980
model to try to fit within a business so

181
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:09,709
it took a little time to figure out the

182
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:11,780
sweet spot and I still am about trying

183
00:08:09,709 --> 00:08:14,199
to figure out kind of not the the lowest

184
00:08:11,779 --> 00:08:16,849
possible amount of data to analyze but

185
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:19,039
the what would give a what would give us

186
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:21,470
the most amount of statistical power and

187
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:24,170
the shortest amount of time to answer

188
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:27,710
some of these questions so you know

189
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:30,379
things that I would like to do at a you

190
00:08:27,709 --> 00:08:31,909
know a slower pace or collect as much

191
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:34,279
data as possible I need to maybe

192
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:37,460
truncate a little bit and maybe collect

193
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:38,870
the same amount of data just in a

194
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:40,400
shorter amount of time so that's just

195
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:43,460
more repeated measurements of things

196
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:45,139
rather than a longer duration and just

197
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:47,330
the harvest cycle itself right will

198
00:08:45,139 --> 00:08:49,370
really kind of determine you know how

199
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:52,160
much time you have to collect some of

200
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:54,320
these data and then after that it's just

201
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:56,839
a matter of well that was one

202
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,920
let's try this again maybe with some

203
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:00,410
different strains or different

204
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:04,610
phenotypes right and and and go at it

205
00:09:00,409 --> 00:09:06,980
again so it's been again a new learning

206
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:10,190
experience for me to to take research

207
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:14,420
and kind of find its way through the

208
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:17,450
kind of the environment really that that

209
00:09:14,419 --> 00:09:21,079
is a functioning you know peer to

210
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:22,520
business cannabis production yeah so I

211
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,320
say I think what you're hinting at is

212
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:26,360
the fact that you have a commercial

213
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,510
facility that's a for-profit business

214
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,919
that you're trying to balance the sort

215
00:09:29,509 --> 00:09:33,559
of data collection and research that

216
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:36,229
you're doing with the fact that you also

217
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:38,239
have to be profitable just to write just

218
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:39,680
to stay in business and when I look at

219
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,740
data collection and correct me on

220
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:43,969
anything here as we go I think the

221
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:46,460
important thing to keep in mind is that

222
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:48,889
it's it's really good to identify what

223
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:51,580
metrics are important to great first of

224
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:54,470
all so the first thing is to identify

225
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:56,780
what what data do we want to collect and

226
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:59,330
how do we isolate that data to make sure

227
00:09:56,779 --> 00:10:01,610
that it it's useful so if we're cool you

228
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:03,530
know if we're just looking at yield

229
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:06,430
there's so many variables that go into

230
00:10:03,529 --> 00:10:09,259
yield that number is useful in seeing

231
00:10:06,429 --> 00:10:11,000
you know how the business is growing in

232
00:10:09,259 --> 00:10:12,470
terms of the the plant cycle but it's

233
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,090
not really telling us why it doesn't

234
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:15,889
tell us if it was the environment it

235
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:18,379
doesn't tell us if it was the soil or

236
00:10:15,889 --> 00:10:21,199
the nutrient level or the watering all

237
00:10:18,379 --> 00:10:24,679
of these factors so really having to

238
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,390
isolate each of those variables in a you

239
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:27,919
know a functioning facility I think is

240
00:10:26,389 --> 00:10:29,720
there is a real challenge like you're

241
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:31,879
like you're getting out there right and

242
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:35,389
I another way to put it would be you

243
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:36,980
know we're really so far I've seen we're

244
00:10:35,389 --> 00:10:39,679
really trying to just investigate the

245
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:41,330
pattern right like increasing yields

246
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:43,699
would be a really nice pattern to pick

247
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:46,250
up on how do we get these fields to get

248
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:49,100
bigger how do we get is it the bud size

249
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:51,470
is it more buds per plant is it a better

250
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:53,450
ratio between dry weight to wet weight

251
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:56,600
like there's all these different ways

252
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:58,040
you can get at a better yield the stuff

253
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:03,860
that gets trickier is when you're trying

254
00:10:58,039 --> 00:11:06,889
to nail down the the the mechanism right

255
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:07,430
what's the biological cause and effect

256
00:11:06,889 --> 00:11:09,319
here

257
00:11:07,429 --> 00:11:11,179
for why we're getting the bigger buds or

258
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,670
why we're getting more buds per plant or

259
00:11:11,179 --> 00:11:15,829
why we're getting the better you know

260
00:11:13,669 --> 00:11:17,919
ratio between dry dry weight to wet

261
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:21,050
weight so it's the the why of it is

262
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:24,079
really kind of that the drilling down on

263
00:11:21,049 --> 00:11:27,759
the actual biological mechanism is what

264
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:31,520
can really take you down a very long

265
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:34,189
arduous path of you know hunting down

266
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:36,079
different variables throwing out ones

267
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:37,880
that you've tested and then refining

268
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:40,910
your approach refining your hypotheses

269
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:42,740
and going and going and going and of

270
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:45,319
course everything's got a price right

271
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:47,570
and if you find that you do this one

272
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:49,970
thing and it's like oh my god the yields

273
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:52,850
went up you know some incredibly

274
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:55,009
statistically significant amount then

275
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:58,279
maybe it is worth the time and effort to

276
00:11:55,009 --> 00:12:01,730
really try to find that one mechanism

277
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:03,439
that's causing that but until then it's

278
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:05,870
really just kind of you're trying to

279
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:09,140
change variables to keep a consistent

280
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:11,659
pattern of increasing most likely yield

281
00:12:09,139 --> 00:12:14,299
which like you said will will turn into

282
00:12:11,659 --> 00:12:16,149
increase profitability so one of the

283
00:12:14,299 --> 00:12:19,849
things let's talk about this first

284
00:12:16,149 --> 00:12:24,620
experiment so you wrote this white paper

285
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:27,920
that I got to assist on from down at

286
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:31,460
gold leaf and yeah the the paper was

287
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:33,740
really it was comparing plants grown in

288
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:35,930
isolate isolated containers versus

289
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:38,659
communal bed systems so gold leaf has

290
00:12:35,929 --> 00:12:41,359
been growing in essentially these raised

291
00:12:38,659 --> 00:12:44,419
beds for years now using the same soil

292
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,039
over and over and reinventing it but you

293
00:12:44,419 --> 00:12:47,509
wanted to see what would happen if we

294
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:49,189
went to containers because containers

295
00:12:47,509 --> 00:12:52,399
are a lot easier to move around the

296
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:56,090
facility there's a lot of pros and cons

297
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:59,120
to both both options so can we talk a

298
00:12:56,090 --> 00:13:01,970
little bit about your hypothesis and

299
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:04,399
then also some of the challenges in

300
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:07,040
setting up the methodology yeah of

301
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:10,850
course so the general hypothesis right

302
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:12,589
is is organisms like to be around other

303
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:14,360
organisms particularly plants and

304
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:15,950
there's a lot of research that I'm

305
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:19,639
really just starting to scratch the

306
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:21,170
surface on as far as plants not only

307
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:22,730
recognizing that there are other

308
00:13:21,169 --> 00:13:25,909
plants around but they can understand

309
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:28,730
the identity of those plants around and

310
00:13:25,909 --> 00:13:32,899
if those plants that are neighboring

311
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:36,920
them they are of the same species or

312
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:39,379
conspecifics they will actually behave

313
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:42,110
in altruistic behaviors right so they'll

314
00:13:39,379 --> 00:13:44,059
actually sacrifice some of their own

315
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:47,060
energy to alert plants of the same

316
00:13:44,059 --> 00:13:49,819
species nearby that there's a pest or

317
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:51,528
something's going on or you know there's

318
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:54,829
some kind of other ailment or

319
00:13:51,528 --> 00:13:57,289
perturbation in the system so that's all

320
00:13:54,828 --> 00:13:59,120
really cool and then you know you heard

321
00:13:57,289 --> 00:14:01,189
of this or some people may have heard of

322
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,519
this kind of word gets thrown around

323
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:07,149
about what's called tree talk which is

324
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:10,209
you know trees can share these ecto

325
00:14:07,149 --> 00:14:13,389
mycorrhizal fungus associations for

326
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:16,849
miles and miles and miles so they're

327
00:14:13,389 --> 00:14:20,180
communicating in the soil using these

328
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:22,250
kind of fungal networks right so there's

329
00:14:20,179 --> 00:14:26,359
a whole host of different again

330
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:29,299
mechanisms that may help assist plants

331
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:32,000
in figuring out well is this neighbor

332
00:14:29,299 --> 00:14:33,559
next to me gonna hurt me am I gonna have

333
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,600
to compete with it am I gonna have to

334
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:39,828
attack it am I gonna have to defend

335
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:42,470
myself from it or is this a like species

336
00:14:39,828 --> 00:14:47,239
that I'll be able to actually share a

337
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:50,449
network with to promote growth or health

338
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:53,959
or resilience --is so the hypothesis was

339
00:14:50,448 --> 00:14:56,809
to you know we would we expected that

340
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:59,239
plants out of the same species right

341
00:14:56,809 --> 00:15:02,299
particularly even the same strains would

342
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:04,519
actually work together when grown in

343
00:15:02,299 --> 00:15:06,528
these living soil beds rather than when

344
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:08,179
they're grown in isolation and don't

345
00:15:06,528 --> 00:15:11,750
have the opportunity to share

346
00:15:08,179 --> 00:15:14,028
information through Network other

347
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:17,389
research has been done where even plants

348
00:15:14,028 --> 00:15:19,879
touching another plant you know

349
00:15:17,389 --> 00:15:24,259
literally rubbing up against another

350
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:27,620
plant can induce stress levels or you

351
00:15:24,259 --> 00:15:30,620
know other kinds of responses so what we

352
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:32,179
did was we use the system that gold

353
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:34,278
Leafs been using like you said for four

354
00:15:32,179 --> 00:15:34,879
years and it's important to note that

355
00:15:34,278 --> 00:15:37,279
we're not

356
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:41,769
starting out with fresh soil here we're

357
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:45,350
starting out with very well aged and

358
00:15:41,769 --> 00:15:47,149
advanced soil I guess you could say what

359
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:50,450
is important to note that as we use the

360
00:15:47,149 --> 00:15:51,769
same soil in both the beds and the pots

361
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:56,780
right so this is all coming from the

362
00:15:51,769 --> 00:15:59,960
same source so we took these beds and we

363
00:15:56,779 --> 00:16:02,059
put six plants in each bed and then

364
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,470
those six plants were then contained in

365
00:16:02,059 --> 00:16:06,049
one trellis which kind of helps with

366
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:09,769
secondary growth and in support as they

367
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:12,349
go and we took six plants and put them

368
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:15,049
individually in twelve gallon pots and

369
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:18,409
then those six plants would share a

370
00:16:15,049 --> 00:16:22,879
trellis as well and then we just would

371
00:16:18,409 --> 00:16:25,339
try to control or hold constant at all

372
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:27,289
the other variables right so and the

373
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:30,230
best way to do that is to have them try

374
00:16:27,289 --> 00:16:35,269
to share a space as close as possible I

375
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:37,430
mean we all know that lighting lighting

376
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:40,639
spectrum lighting intensity can change

377
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:42,859
pretty rapidly even moving around the

378
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,689
same room so we wanted to have these

379
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:47,300
beds and these pots kind of side-by-side

380
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:50,300
to try to hold that constant try to

381
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:53,120
control for that waterings were all done

382
00:16:50,299 --> 00:16:55,309
at the same times and at the same levels

383
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,679
so watering was held constant and then

384
00:16:55,309 --> 00:16:59,829
of course they were all harvested at the

385
00:16:57,679 --> 00:17:02,149
same time and the wet weights were

386
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:03,830
measured at the same time so that was

387
00:17:02,149 --> 00:17:08,180
kind of the methodology and hypothesis

388
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:10,549
behind that so been many people would

389
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:13,789
look at a trial like this and just say

390
00:17:10,549 --> 00:17:16,159
something like well duh I mean we all

391
00:17:13,789 --> 00:17:18,529
know that plants would like to be in

392
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,720
beds over pots but I think it's

393
00:17:18,529 --> 00:17:22,068
important that we do try and test these

394
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,150
things out to actually see if they're

395
00:17:22,068 --> 00:17:25,129
true because there's a lot of examples

396
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:28,640
in science where we take things for

397
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:30,770
granted as being as being true without

398
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,410
actually testing them out in fact Tim

399
00:17:30,769 --> 00:17:34,910
Wilson with microbe organics so I've had

400
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:37,130
on the podcast was sort of the one that

401
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:39,019
really opened my eyes to that in a lot

402
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:42,680
of ways around things with compost tea

403
00:17:39,019 --> 00:17:45,170
yeah I mean sorry yeah it's a really

404
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:48,500
good point because it's kind of a aside

405
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:51,740
but to your point my whole PhD

406
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:55,940
on moray eels started out asking these

407
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:58,970
really kind of advanced questions as far

408
00:17:55,940 --> 00:18:01,610
as larval dispersal and ocean currents

409
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:04,850
and genetic makeups of populations and

410
00:18:01,609 --> 00:18:07,009
all these really kind of like questions

411
00:18:04,849 --> 00:18:08,990
that you would expect to answer or to

412
00:18:07,009 --> 00:18:11,960
ask at least you know in this kind of in

413
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:13,490
this day and age of marine research and

414
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:16,670
as I was doing the background research

415
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:18,710
to try to just lay the foundation to

416
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:22,430
answer those questions I was finding

417
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:27,970
pothole after pothole after just

418
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:34,850
non-existent puddle of of information on

419
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:37,640
really basic things such as how old can

420
00:18:34,849 --> 00:18:41,179
amore get what do they eat how often do

421
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:43,640
they move how much do they move how many

422
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:45,049
can occur in a given area and let all of

423
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:48,710
these kind of very fundamental basic

424
00:18:45,049 --> 00:18:51,769
Natural History biological questions had

425
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:54,920
not been answered and it took me six

426
00:18:51,769 --> 00:18:57,470
months to find the answer to how old

427
00:18:54,920 --> 00:19:00,200
dozen California where I live I mean you

428
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:02,480
would look around on museum or aquarium

429
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:04,069
websites you know just kind of general

430
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,680
info and you'd get oh they could live to

431
00:19:04,069 --> 00:19:09,799
be about almost 30 years ok great well

432
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:11,060
where did that data come from what's the

433
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:12,799
source on this right that's what you

434
00:19:11,059 --> 00:19:15,230
always gotta try to figure out is who

435
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:17,960
did the study when was it done and so

436
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:21,680
forth and it took me six months to trace

437
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:25,730
down it turned out that that age of

438
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:27,529
amore came from a single individual that

439
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:29,990
was living in a tank and it got

440
00:19:27,529 --> 00:19:34,670
published I mean this was back in the

441
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:39,200
early 70s so just based on that single

442
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:44,539
anecdotal non representation of a

443
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:47,500
natural population we had this kind of

444
00:19:44,539 --> 00:19:50,000
data point that's laid the framework for

445
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:52,519
decades of this is how old a more I can

446
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:56,180
be and I think the cannabis industry is

447
00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:58,429
at the same point where you have been

448
00:19:56,180 --> 00:20:00,560
you know it's everybody has been

449
00:19:58,429 --> 00:20:02,149
researching cannabis in their own way in

450
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:04,548
their own backyard in their own

451
00:20:02,148 --> 00:20:06,168
you know what have you but it's gotten

452
00:20:04,548 --> 00:20:09,739
to the point where it's scaled up so

453
00:20:06,169 --> 00:20:11,859
much that really understanding these

454
00:20:09,739 --> 00:20:15,649
questions and collecting the right data

455
00:20:11,858 --> 00:20:17,328
can make really big financial have

456
00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:20,598
really big financial implications right

457
00:20:17,328 --> 00:20:22,158
so I think it's really the the whole how

458
00:20:20,598 --> 00:20:23,838
to grow cannabis whether it be

459
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:27,019
organically or hydroponically or what

460
00:20:23,838 --> 00:20:29,259
have you is that a kind of a really big

461
00:20:27,019 --> 00:20:31,729
turning point right now where the data

462
00:20:29,259 --> 00:20:33,739
really needs to start being collected on

463
00:20:31,729 --> 00:20:36,259
things that maybe we've always taken for

464
00:20:33,739 --> 00:20:39,108
granted because we really don't know

465
00:20:36,259 --> 00:20:40,878
outside of maybe some anecdotal stuff if

466
00:20:39,108 --> 00:20:44,028
that's really true or not

467
00:20:40,878 --> 00:20:45,588
yes I want it I want to touch on a some

468
00:20:44,028 --> 00:20:47,388
of these things within the experimental

469
00:20:45,588 --> 00:20:49,548
design really quickly and then get into

470
00:20:47,388 --> 00:20:51,438
what you found for the results so

471
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:53,509
essentially you were using beds that

472
00:20:51,439 --> 00:20:57,528
were custom-made they were 3 feet by 3

473
00:20:53,509 --> 00:20:58,999
and 3/4 feet by 3/4 feet tall so all of

474
00:20:57,528 --> 00:21:00,648
this will be in the white paper and you

475
00:20:58,999 --> 00:21:03,019
can go on to the website

476
00:21:00,648 --> 00:21:05,808
kiss organics calm and they'll be the

477
00:21:03,019 --> 00:21:09,048
latest blog post and I'll also put links

478
00:21:05,808 --> 00:21:12,078
up to it on the podcast page so each

479
00:21:09,048 --> 00:21:15,638
plant had in the container it looks like

480
00:21:12,078 --> 00:21:18,588
it worked out 21.5 5 cubic feet of soil

481
00:21:15,638 --> 00:21:21,288
per plant and then in the bed it worked

482
00:21:18,588 --> 00:21:22,969
out to one point four one cubic feet of

483
00:21:21,288 --> 00:21:27,199
soil per plant so you actually had more

484
00:21:22,969 --> 00:21:29,689
soil per plant in the Benton's in the

485
00:21:27,199 --> 00:21:33,349
pot than you did in the communal bed

486
00:21:29,689 --> 00:21:35,028
right yeah and then when we look at it

487
00:21:33,348 --> 00:21:36,259
lighting was the same watering was the

488
00:21:35,028 --> 00:21:39,459
same all of the things that you

489
00:21:36,259 --> 00:21:43,159
mentioned were the same and then your

490
00:21:39,459 --> 00:21:45,109
metric was the wet weight because

491
00:21:43,159 --> 00:21:46,789
unfortunately in the way your facility

492
00:21:45,108 --> 00:21:48,648
processes you weren't able to collect

493
00:21:46,788 --> 00:21:52,158
dry weights accurately cuz things get

494
00:21:48,648 --> 00:21:55,158
moved around right it involves kind of

495
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:57,409
tracing the same bud through a host of

496
00:21:55,159 --> 00:22:00,049
different processes and across many

497
00:21:57,409 --> 00:22:01,699
different you know employees handling it

498
00:22:00,048 --> 00:22:04,878
and then it's just one of those things

499
00:22:01,699 --> 00:22:06,979
that you know again if the if the cost

500
00:22:04,878 --> 00:22:09,048
really is there and it's excuse me it

501
00:22:06,979 --> 00:22:11,179
makes me makes financial sense to really

502
00:22:09,048 --> 00:22:13,398
track this kind of data down and that's

503
00:22:11,179 --> 00:22:15,220
one thing but again first cast at an

504
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:16,750
exploratory study kind of

505
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:18,640
such as this it didn't you know it

506
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:21,730
didn't really didn't really make sense

507
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:24,370
to try to mess up the workflow so to

508
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:26,980
speak to to try to track down that kind

509
00:22:24,369 --> 00:22:29,349
of data yeah and so then you took the

510
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:33,159
information that you gathered the data

511
00:22:29,349 --> 00:22:35,139
and you ran it through a significance to

512
00:22:33,159 --> 00:22:37,179
keys on a significant test which frankly

513
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:38,850
I don't really understand myself so I

514
00:22:37,179 --> 00:22:41,500
don't want to get into it too much but

515
00:22:38,849 --> 00:22:46,209
the long story short was you threw out

516
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:49,359
one outlier in your data the Kualoa

517
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:51,759
sunrise that brightly yielded really

518
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:54,939
well in the beds you want to talk about

519
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:57,940
that yeah so it wasn't actually thrown

520
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:59,350
out the reason I decided not to throw it

521
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:01,990
out is because there wasn't actually a

522
00:22:59,349 --> 00:23:04,629
statistically different a significantly

523
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:05,980
different result between the homogenous

524
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:10,450
bed or the cloth pot for the clothes

525
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:11,950
sunrise you can see it that's good in

526
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:14,110
the in the white paper you'll see

527
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:15,900
grateful breath the which was found to

528
00:23:14,109 --> 00:23:18,339
be significant has a little asterisk

529
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:21,250
above the two bars which would indicate

530
00:23:18,339 --> 00:23:23,709
that grateful grass actually grew

531
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:26,019
significantly better in homogeneous beds

532
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:29,079
and it didn't cloth pots but Koloa

533
00:23:26,019 --> 00:23:29,980
while it did grow much better it wasn't

534
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:33,369
significantly better

535
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:35,589
had it been significant then kind of you

536
00:23:33,369 --> 00:23:37,479
go through this decision tree well is it

537
00:23:35,589 --> 00:23:40,899
significant because of this weird

538
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:43,630
outlier bed that did really good and in

539
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:45,309
which case you remove hat and then you

540
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:47,289
run the test again and then if it's

541
00:23:45,308 --> 00:23:48,428
significant then you can keep it in

542
00:23:47,288 --> 00:23:50,950
there if it's not so gaming it

543
00:23:48,429 --> 00:23:52,929
significant then you kind of go back to

544
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:55,058
your experimental design and figure out

545
00:23:52,929 --> 00:23:57,159
well what's the question I'm asking is

546
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:59,649
this one outlier truly an outlier and

547
00:23:57,159 --> 00:24:04,179
then you get into the whole I need more

548
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:05,440
data kind of Marathon to really make

549
00:24:04,179 --> 00:24:09,210
sure that it wasn't an outlier maybe

550
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:12,730
it's just you know if we had another bed

551
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:15,519
that was between the mean the average

552
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:17,288
for the homogenous bed for close sunrise

553
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:18,819
and that outlier then all of a sudden

554
00:24:17,288 --> 00:24:21,908
that outlier doesn't become an outlier

555
00:24:18,819 --> 00:24:26,439
just becomes the maximum value for that

556
00:24:21,909 --> 00:24:28,559
group so that's kind of the way the

557
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:30,970
statistics work for this one

558
00:24:28,558 --> 00:24:33,750
like I said grateful breath was

559
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:35,190
significantly better in Hajus beds

560
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:38,079
[Music]

561
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:41,080
however all of the three strains we

562
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:42,369
tested did perform better and it kind of

563
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:44,740
brings up another interesting point

564
00:24:42,369 --> 00:24:47,399
where the fields of Statistics and

565
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:49,630
academia may be clash a little bit with

566
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:52,298
you know business practices right

567
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:55,510
because if you're growing something and

568
00:24:52,298 --> 00:24:58,839
it's better but it's not significantly

569
00:24:55,509 --> 00:25:01,599
better then it really comes down to you

570
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:04,058
know an ROI or return on investment kind

571
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:06,428
of question where you know is it worth

572
00:25:04,058 --> 00:25:10,210
investing this many resources to get

573
00:25:06,429 --> 00:25:11,710
this much better and there you go you

574
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:14,440
have your decision but at least this

575
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:16,000
kind of data does show that well yeah if

576
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:19,450
I stop to spend a little bit more on

577
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:22,509
deads than pause for example I will at

578
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:25,179
least recoup this money faster because

579
00:25:22,509 --> 00:25:27,490
the plants will be growing better yeah

580
00:25:25,179 --> 00:25:31,750
now this this white paper is far from

581
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:33,519
perfect be fair to be fair and this is

582
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:36,069
something we've talked about in at

583
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:37,750
length so one of the things that that we

584
00:25:36,069 --> 00:25:40,990
talked about was it really would be good

585
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:43,119
to measure dry weight now yeah visually

586
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:45,160
I think you commented to me that deep

587
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:47,289
buds looked very comparable in terms of

588
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:50,620
the ratio of you know sort of leaf

589
00:25:47,289 --> 00:25:52,539
matter to two buds but that would be you

590
00:25:50,619 --> 00:25:55,599
know in theory you could have a result

591
00:25:52,539 --> 00:25:57,759
where the homogenous bed produced a lot

592
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:59,529
of leaf matter but much smaller buds and

593
00:25:57,759 --> 00:26:04,000
so your dry weight which is your actual

594
00:25:59,529 --> 00:26:05,918
metric could be much lower but right in

595
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,690
this case we weren't able to and then

596
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:09,880
also you know replication so that's the

597
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:12,669
other thing with Sciences if you're able

598
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:14,679
to create this results in your in this

599
00:26:12,669 --> 00:26:16,090
in gold leaf facility you'd want to

600
00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:17,590
replicate it again in gold leaf but

601
00:26:16,089 --> 00:26:20,339
you'd also want to replicate it in other

602
00:26:17,589 --> 00:26:24,369
facilities you know in other locations

603
00:26:20,339 --> 00:26:27,579
yeah absolutely and and using your right

604
00:26:24,369 --> 00:26:30,279
to really test the the question you're

605
00:26:27,579 --> 00:26:31,750
really trying to get at is do I want to

606
00:26:30,279 --> 00:26:34,089
grow my plants together or do I wanna

607
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:36,160
grow them separately so you would really

608
00:26:34,089 --> 00:26:38,918
even want to try to grow plants in

609
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:40,450
brand-new soil right as opposed to what

610
00:26:38,919 --> 00:26:41,980
we have a gold leaf which is this you

611
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:44,798
know aged

612
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:48,250
you know reused Riya mended kind of

613
00:26:44,798 --> 00:26:50,980
sustained medium because then you could

614
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:52,898
say well I test now the medium becomes a

615
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:56,470
non-factor right if you switch the

616
00:26:52,898 --> 00:26:58,089
medium completely and you still get the

617
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:59,980
same result then you're still on that

618
00:26:58,089 --> 00:27:02,829
that picking up that right pattern right

619
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:05,308
well it's like well it's not the you

620
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:08,859
know secret sauce of having really old

621
00:27:05,308 --> 00:27:12,158
high biodiverse soil because I got the

622
00:27:08,859 --> 00:27:14,798
same results you know using brand new

623
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:17,110
soil so then and then you start to

624
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:20,259
gather more power to kind of supporting

625
00:27:17,109 --> 00:27:21,849
your hypothesis right where you test as

626
00:27:20,259 --> 00:27:23,589
many different combinations of as many

627
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:28,240
different variables just try to nail

628
00:27:23,589 --> 00:27:30,398
down that one question right so even

629
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,528
again you could try different watering

630
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:35,259
techniques and you could try different

631
00:27:32,528 --> 00:27:37,778
lighting sources and if you still get

632
00:27:35,259 --> 00:27:39,940
that same result then you gain in

633
00:27:37,778 --> 00:27:42,898
confidence and saying there really is

634
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:46,230
something here about growing a plant

635
00:27:42,898 --> 00:27:51,609
among neighbors rather than in isolation

636
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:53,259
a lot of the paper to talks about you

637
00:27:51,609 --> 00:27:54,729
know what's happening underneath the

638
00:27:53,259 --> 00:27:58,028
soil you know actor micro as well

639
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:59,079
networks and communication between

640
00:27:58,028 --> 00:28:01,388
plants and things like that

641
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:05,109
another great variable that would be

642
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:07,240
fantastic to measure would be the root

643
00:28:05,109 --> 00:28:10,388
mass right like do we see that these

644
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:14,109
roots are you know putting out a lot

645
00:28:10,388 --> 00:28:19,058
more biomass you know in a bed reaching

646
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:20,678
out to neighbors as opposed to an in

647
00:28:19,058 --> 00:28:23,859
isolation where there there's really

648
00:28:20,679 --> 00:28:27,820
nothing to to handshake with right and

649
00:28:23,859 --> 00:28:29,408
then you really got to get into well is

650
00:28:27,819 --> 00:28:32,980
it the plants that they're going after

651
00:28:29,409 --> 00:28:35,139
or they just exploring more soil right

652
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:38,139
because then you're starting to get into

653
00:28:35,138 --> 00:28:40,329
surface area to volume ratios about you

654
00:28:38,138 --> 00:28:43,000
know a plant maybe feels an edge of a

655
00:28:40,329 --> 00:28:46,720
pot differently than it feels the edge

656
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:50,440
of a bigger volume of soil so these are

657
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:53,159
all the the like I said the the rabbit

658
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:55,630
holes that you can quickly find yourself

659
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:57,930
getting down which are all in

660
00:28:55,630 --> 00:29:00,220
interesting scientifically and

661
00:28:57,930 --> 00:29:03,610
biologically but when it does come down

662
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:06,190
to how is my business going to stay open

663
00:29:03,609 --> 00:29:08,799
make more money those things don't

664
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:10,299
always align yeah so this is really a

665
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:13,980
good starting point for people in

666
00:29:10,299 --> 00:29:16,659
exploring this idea of plant communities

667
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:18,640
in a growing space or in a growing area

668
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:21,009
and I think you're right so if we wanted

669
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,780
to gain more confidence in that the fact

670
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:25,180
that what is allowing for this plant

671
00:29:22,779 --> 00:29:28,180
growth is really the communal aspect of

672
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:30,850
these plants then we would want to grow

673
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:33,640
in cocoa using nutrient line for example

674
00:29:30,849 --> 00:29:37,480
our chelated ionic nutrient so we'd want

675
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:40,030
to grow you know in in other media and

676
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:42,250
in other methods and see if we can

677
00:29:40,029 --> 00:29:43,809
replicate that same result but

678
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:45,369
ultimately at the end of the day if

679
00:29:43,809 --> 00:29:48,609
you're running a facility you don't

680
00:29:45,369 --> 00:29:50,379
really care as much about that you just

681
00:29:48,609 --> 00:29:52,689
care about what your results are in your

682
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:55,300
facility so go for gold leaf in this

683
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:57,789
case growing in these communal beds make

684
00:29:55,299 --> 00:29:59,230
sense based on the results that's though

685
00:29:57,789 --> 00:30:02,109
that's the one thing that we can

686
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:04,420
probably take away from this this white

687
00:30:02,109 --> 00:30:05,979
paper more than anything and I think

688
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:08,230
that's important so if you're doing

689
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:10,000
research you're looking at ways you can

690
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:12,250
profit off of this and for gold leaf you

691
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,690
know you're gonna profit more by

692
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:15,220
continuing to grow in the manner that

693
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:18,730
you were I guess is essentially what we

694
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:21,299
came to yep exactly and again this is

695
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:24,519
these are three out of the you know

696
00:30:21,299 --> 00:30:27,490
almost at least hundreds of strains we

697
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:30,119
have currently at gold leaf and you can

698
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:31,900
see already we have a one strain it's

699
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:34,329
significantly better than the other two

700
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:36,070
we're not significantly better so that

701
00:30:34,329 --> 00:30:37,509
right there is a question why grateful

702
00:30:36,069 --> 00:30:40,000
breaths and of course there's going to

703
00:30:37,509 --> 00:30:42,279
be just some genetics involved there but

704
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,049
you know when you get into well why if

705
00:30:42,279 --> 00:30:46,329
does the genetics of graceful breast

706
00:30:44,049 --> 00:30:49,839
respond significantly better than the

707
00:30:46,329 --> 00:30:52,720
other two do not and you know you can

708
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:54,909
ask these questions and till you're blue

709
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,620
in the face and and then all of a sudden

710
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:59,769
at six years later and you're trying to

711
00:30:56,619 --> 00:31:01,179
finish a ph.d program but that's that's

712
00:30:59,769 --> 00:31:03,789
how science works and that's how you

713
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:06,340
really you really know if you're doing

714
00:31:03,789 --> 00:31:08,109
it well if at the end of an experiment

715
00:31:06,339 --> 00:31:08,599
you have more questions than when you

716
00:31:08,109 --> 00:31:13,548
started

717
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:17,329
the the uncovering of a pattern or a

718
00:31:13,548 --> 00:31:20,148
mechanism really does open doors that if

719
00:31:17,329 --> 00:31:23,480
done correctly you didn't even know

720
00:31:20,148 --> 00:31:26,808
we're there yet because you didn't let

721
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:29,179
the data tell you where the different

722
00:31:26,808 --> 00:31:31,398
results could come from right you don't

723
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:33,288
know if it's the bed or the pot or if

724
00:31:31,398 --> 00:31:36,408
it's the plant or the genetic sort of

725
00:31:33,288 --> 00:31:38,179
you know go on and on and on but when

726
00:31:36,409 --> 00:31:39,649
you do the data collection right you get

727
00:31:38,179 --> 00:31:42,019
all these interesting patterns and you

728
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:45,469
you want to figure out why why is this

729
00:31:42,019 --> 00:31:48,349
this way and then off you go yeah that's

730
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:50,329
great let's uh since we have a few of

731
00:31:48,349 --> 00:31:52,148
these papers to kind of talk about a

732
00:31:50,329 --> 00:31:54,079
couple other things we want to mention

733
00:31:52,148 --> 00:31:56,628
let's go ahead and move on to talk a

734
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:58,990
little bit about the blue mats and some

735
00:31:56,628 --> 00:32:01,490
of your results there so yeah Oh

736
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:04,519
probably about Moses six months ago

737
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:08,899
eight months ago we got some blue mats

738
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:10,638
set up at gold leaf to compare the hand

739
00:32:08,898 --> 00:32:13,069
watering that was going on and gold leaf

740
00:32:10,638 --> 00:32:14,869
with an automated irrigation system like

741
00:32:13,069 --> 00:32:17,569
blue mats where the plant really

742
00:32:14,869 --> 00:32:20,148
controls controls the watering process

743
00:32:17,569 --> 00:32:22,788
based on the the moisture content of the

744
00:32:20,148 --> 00:32:26,628
soil do you want to talk a little bit

745
00:32:22,788 --> 00:32:28,669
about that experiment yeah so we were it

746
00:32:26,628 --> 00:32:32,689
was great we got some enough blue mat

747
00:32:28,669 --> 00:32:35,690
material to run basically 11 of the of

748
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:39,470
the beds that we have in a given room

749
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:42,500
and we wanted to see if we could maybe

750
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:44,778
save a little bit of time on labor and

751
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:48,138
if the plants responded you know better

752
00:32:44,778 --> 00:32:53,000
the same worse we really didn't know at

753
00:32:48,138 --> 00:32:58,398
gold leaf it's a very much hands-on you

754
00:32:53,000 --> 00:33:01,089
know organic craft mentality so all of

755
00:32:58,398 --> 00:33:04,308
the plants are at least visually seen

756
00:33:01,089 --> 00:33:05,869
once a day if not more than that

757
00:33:04,308 --> 00:33:09,168
is a very intimate relationship between

758
00:33:05,869 --> 00:33:11,048
the gardener's and the plants they're so

759
00:33:09,169 --> 00:33:14,389
hand watering is something that's a

760
00:33:11,048 --> 00:33:14,720
daily multi few no it happens all the

761
00:33:14,388 --> 00:33:19,519
time

762
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:22,400
so it takes a bit of time and you know

763
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:24,319
we we plant strains in homogenous

764
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:29,360
meaning so you have one strain per bed

765
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:32,809
but you have in one bed you'll have you

766
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:36,769
know kept pineapple mimosa for example

767
00:33:32,809 --> 00:33:39,679
and then the next bed you'll have animal

768
00:33:36,769 --> 00:33:41,420
sherbert - right next to it so when

769
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:44,269
someone's going around watering you're

770
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:48,289
really kind of watering by experience

771
00:33:44,269 --> 00:33:50,000
and by either feel or by visual

772
00:33:48,289 --> 00:33:52,879
inspection right well that looks damp or

773
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,099
take up a clump of dirt and mushing

774
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:57,410
around and well that feels dry and so

775
00:33:55,099 --> 00:34:00,949
your water accordingly but as anybody

776
00:33:57,410 --> 00:34:02,840
knows you know my dry may be different

777
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:07,419
than your dry and your wet might be my

778
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:10,159
damp so there's a lot of room for error

779
00:34:07,419 --> 00:34:13,159
even in amongst experienced gardeners

780
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:17,260
right so with this blue match does is it

781
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:21,320
kind of allows the plant to be the

782
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:23,030
captain of its own watering needs right

783
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:25,640
it gets to make that decision for itself

784
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:26,990
so what we wanted to do is we wanted to

785
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:29,839
put a bunch of these different strains

786
00:34:26,989 --> 00:34:33,589
side by side as we normally do and run a

787
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:37,730
blue mass supply line with some blue

788
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:41,329
soap drip tape through them and uh just

789
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:44,119
opposite them we would run the same

790
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:45,648
setup just without the blue mats so it'd

791
00:34:44,119 --> 00:34:48,589
be the same strains mirrored on either

792
00:34:45,648 --> 00:34:52,819
side of this aisle so for example the

793
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:56,120
right aisle would be 11 or so different

794
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:58,309
strains and on the left side would be

795
00:34:56,119 --> 00:35:00,589
the same strange just not you know

796
00:34:58,309 --> 00:35:04,489
fitted with the blue mat system and hand

797
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:06,920
watered so we did that and you know

798
00:35:04,489 --> 00:35:10,579
those were installed I think the day

799
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:12,349
after the plants were transplanted into

800
00:35:10,579 --> 00:35:14,750
the into the beds and those were

801
00:35:12,349 --> 00:35:18,170
installed and I would go around and make

802
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:20,090
sure that the the soil moisture was kind

803
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:23,150
of hanging around right at a hundred

804
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:24,710
mbar kind of as a you know as a previous

805
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:26,840
discussion I had with you about what the

806
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:30,289
what that kind of soil makeup would

807
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:34,730
would benefit from and we let those

808
00:35:30,289 --> 00:35:36,019
things just run the beds that were

809
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:39,670
retrofitted with

810
00:35:36,019 --> 00:35:42,889
blue mats did it receive additional

811
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:44,659
inputs you know whether it's compost

812
00:35:42,889 --> 00:35:46,389
teas or different you know feeding

813
00:35:44,659 --> 00:35:48,710
regimes and stuff so that was done

814
00:35:46,389 --> 00:35:51,849
outside of the blue mat system because

815
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:54,019
if you try to throw too much organic

816
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:55,489
material through those you know tight

817
00:35:54,019 --> 00:35:57,530
lines and stuff they can get fouled up

818
00:35:55,489 --> 00:35:59,509
pretty quickly and then you're having

819
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:02,210
some not favorable things getting water

820
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:05,030
into your beds so it was just strictly

821
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:07,220
water that was going through the blue

822
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:09,530
mat system which means that both the

823
00:36:07,219 --> 00:36:11,750
blue mats and the non blue mats beds

824
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:14,780
we're getting we're receiving the

825
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:16,010
identical feeding regimes which is which

826
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:20,570
was again great because it's something

827
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:22,040
you want to hold constant so yeah it was

828
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:23,720
it was a really cool experiment we let

829
00:36:22,039 --> 00:36:26,800
the beds run all the way to flower and

830
00:36:23,719 --> 00:36:30,019
then again similarly to the pots versus

831
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:32,119
beds white paper we just kind of stop

832
00:36:30,019 --> 00:36:34,820
data collection at the above-ground

833
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:38,000
biomass or the wet weights and just

834
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:40,789
compared those yeah so I know you tried

835
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:43,280
out a couple different designs here for

836
00:36:40,789 --> 00:36:44,539
the blue mats too and you got a little

837
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,609
bit of data from that but the main thing

838
00:36:44,539 --> 00:36:48,769
was just comparing hand watering versus

839
00:36:46,608 --> 00:36:50,869
an automated system like blue mats

840
00:36:48,769 --> 00:36:52,400
because I think it's important to

841
00:36:50,869 --> 00:36:55,340
distinguish between automated irrigation

842
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:57,710
systems too because even with these ones

843
00:36:55,340 --> 00:37:00,619
that are on timers we're still they're

844
00:36:57,710 --> 00:37:02,769
still we're still manually as a human

845
00:37:00,619 --> 00:37:05,690
telling the plant when it wants or needs

846
00:37:02,769 --> 00:37:06,949
water whereas with this blue mat system

847
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:08,690
we're just maintaining the moisture

848
00:37:06,949 --> 00:37:10,730
content at the current level that we

849
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:13,909
establish and I want to give credit to

850
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:15,800
giant Palmer for the hundred mbar mark

851
00:37:13,909 --> 00:37:18,500
that was something that he came up with

852
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:19,789
through his research I'd like to test

853
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:22,369
out some different you know would be

854
00:37:19,789 --> 00:37:25,730
good to repeat this and look at 110 mbar

855
00:37:22,369 --> 00:37:27,559
90 or what range is possibly optimal but

856
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:30,829
as of right now I think 100 is a great

857
00:37:27,559 --> 00:37:32,840
starting point and yeah you know let's

858
00:37:30,829 --> 00:37:36,170
talk a little bit about your results so

859
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:38,240
what did you find using the automated

860
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:40,099
watering the blue mats versus your hand

861
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:41,479
waters and I do want to emphasize that

862
00:37:40,099 --> 00:37:43,039
the guys that we had hand watering and

863
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:44,510
for this experiment I know a lot of them

864
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:46,989
personally I've known him for years

865
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:48,580
they're excellent at their job

866
00:37:46,989 --> 00:37:51,789
and they're they know how to grow

867
00:37:48,579 --> 00:37:52,960
cannabis and it's not just like some

868
00:37:51,789 --> 00:37:54,639
random hires off the road that are

869
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,929
watering plants you know some of these

870
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:58,239
guys have been doing it for decades

871
00:37:55,929 --> 00:38:01,598
so yeah super committed to the craft and

872
00:37:58,239 --> 00:38:03,338
just absolutely love the plant so it was

873
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:04,720
great to be able to have that to compare

874
00:38:03,338 --> 00:38:06,699
something like this to as opposed to

875
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:09,549
like you said just someone who you know

876
00:38:06,699 --> 00:38:13,329
looks at the soil and sees if it's gray

877
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:15,940
or black so kind of in short the was

878
00:38:13,329 --> 00:38:18,789
actually pretty surprising every so we

879
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:21,659
tested five strains we tested birthday

880
00:38:18,789 --> 00:38:25,088
cake pineapple mimosa animal sherbert -

881
00:38:21,659 --> 00:38:28,899
wedding cake and mimosa and all but

882
00:38:25,088 --> 00:38:32,049
mimosa had way more biomass at the end

883
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:36,670
of the harvest cycle than the non bloom

884
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:40,690
at nan bloom at replicates so we're

885
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:42,608
treatment so for example wedding cake

886
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:45,369
averaged about so this again is a

887
00:38:42,608 --> 00:38:48,608
trellis weight of about this is eight

888
00:38:45,369 --> 00:38:50,980
plants now we bumped up the plants per

889
00:38:48,608 --> 00:38:53,319
bed for this so we were getting about

890
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:55,210
six pounds per trellis for the bloom at

891
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:57,250
bed for wedding cake and the non bloom

892
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:58,389
at bed we had a double a couple of

893
00:38:57,250 --> 00:39:00,639
different controls running so we

894
00:38:58,389 --> 00:39:03,730
averaged those and we were getting just

895
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:08,079
north of four pounds per eight plants so

896
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:11,858
that right there is roughly a 20 almost

897
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:15,579
almost 30% increase in an above-ground

898
00:39:11,858 --> 00:39:17,380
biomass which is was pretty shocking to

899
00:39:15,579 --> 00:39:18,880
me at least and it was it was shocking

900
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:23,108
everybody else there we really didn't

901
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:26,640
expect to see that kind of bump just

902
00:39:23,108 --> 00:39:28,809
basically on letting the plants kind of

903
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:32,618
take the water when they felt they

904
00:39:28,809 --> 00:39:33,789
needed it right so I think again this

905
00:39:32,619 --> 00:39:34,960
will be something that we need to test

906
00:39:33,789 --> 00:39:35,349
more of in fact we're doing that right

907
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:39,220
now

908
00:39:35,349 --> 00:39:40,599
we love the result we probably did save

909
00:39:39,219 --> 00:39:42,759
a little bit of money as far as

910
00:39:40,599 --> 00:39:46,030
labouring goes or at least we were able

911
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:47,609
to focus the the attention of the

912
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:53,830
employees on something a little bit more

913
00:39:47,608 --> 00:39:56,199
delicate than watering and we want to

914
00:39:53,829 --> 00:39:58,659
again see how this works across drains

915
00:39:56,199 --> 00:40:03,548
and if the result holds up then

916
00:39:58,659 --> 00:40:05,440
that's pretty great I think the the

917
00:40:03,548 --> 00:40:07,298
awesome thing about having a bunch of

918
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:09,909
different strains side-by-side again is

919
00:40:07,298 --> 00:40:12,639
you'll have the plant dictate what it

920
00:40:09,909 --> 00:40:15,818
needs right so this is kind of concept

921
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:18,338
of homeostasis right where like for for

922
00:40:15,818 --> 00:40:20,440
human for example if you get too hot

923
00:40:18,338 --> 00:40:22,480
you're gonna start getting outside of

924
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:24,818
that thermal neutral zone and you're

925
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:27,309
gonna start sweating if you get too cold

926
00:40:24,818 --> 00:40:29,409
you start slipping away from your happy

927
00:40:27,309 --> 00:40:31,660
spot you're you know you know your your

928
00:40:29,409 --> 00:40:34,268
setpoint on your thermostat and you

929
00:40:31,659 --> 00:40:35,798
start to shiver so I wouldn't be

930
00:40:34,268 --> 00:40:38,528
surprised if there was the same kind of

931
00:40:35,798 --> 00:40:41,469
homeostasis envelope for a plant for

932
00:40:38,528 --> 00:40:43,150
example right and those can be dialed a

933
00:40:41,469 --> 00:40:46,328
little differently even across strains

934
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:48,519
where you know one plant might be great

935
00:40:46,329 --> 00:40:53,079
like you said at 110 M bar would be

936
00:40:48,518 --> 00:40:55,808
ideal and you know plus 50 minus 50

937
00:40:53,079 --> 00:40:58,150
below that they're okay but if it does

938
00:40:55,809 --> 00:41:00,609
dip below that 4 or above that for a

939
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:01,960
little you might see the plant you know

940
00:41:00,608 --> 00:41:04,420
start to stress out a little bit and

941
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:07,750
what these blue mats do is that allows

942
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:10,690
the is just a constant supply of water

943
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:13,028
and the plants get to dictate when they

944
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:15,880
when they need a drink so the results

945
00:41:13,028 --> 00:41:18,250
are pretty intriguing and promising

946
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:19,599
certainly enough to merit a second run

947
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:22,778
which like I said we're we're doing

948
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:24,099
right now yeah I think one of the things

949
00:41:22,778 --> 00:41:27,179
interesting here with this with the

950
00:41:24,099 --> 00:41:31,259
mimosa is that it makes me wonder if

951
00:41:27,179 --> 00:41:33,699
maybe it would be curious to measure

952
00:41:31,259 --> 00:41:35,588
what if plants that are hand watering

953
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:37,689
versus plants that are watered with the

954
00:41:35,588 --> 00:41:39,429
bloom at to figure out exactly how much

955
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:42,159
water those plants are getting in those

956
00:41:39,429 --> 00:41:45,190
beds and then say okay well maybe the

957
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:48,009
mimosa needs less water just because

958
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:51,190
that particular cultivar you know for

959
00:41:48,009 --> 00:41:53,889
example likes less water or slightly

960
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:56,769
drier soils but I think the main benefit

961
00:41:53,889 --> 00:41:59,318
of this blue mats is maintaining the

962
00:41:56,768 --> 00:42:02,169
moisture content at a level where we get

963
00:41:59,318 --> 00:42:03,909
a lot of microbial activity because like

964
00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:05,889
you said that that idea of homeostasis

965
00:42:03,909 --> 00:42:08,170
when it gets too cold the microbes slow

966
00:42:05,889 --> 00:42:09,730
down and it gets too hot you have

967
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:11,599
similar issues and you and then you have

968
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:15,440
root problems with the

969
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:17,450
the plant itself so I I was surprised I

970
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:19,519
thought you were going to save on labor

971
00:42:17,449 --> 00:42:23,868
I did not think you would get that much

972
00:42:19,518 --> 00:42:25,669
of a bump in yield yeah us too so we

973
00:42:23,869 --> 00:42:28,460
were all pretty excited about it and

974
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:29,690
again we're going with a bunch of

975
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:32,900
different strains for this next round

976
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:35,059
and we're gonna keep the same setup as

977
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:36,528
we had before so we can compare these

978
00:42:35,059 --> 00:42:38,869
data across studies we don't want to

979
00:42:36,528 --> 00:42:40,338
change you know the designs or the

980
00:42:38,869 --> 00:42:41,900
variables because then you're

981
00:42:40,338 --> 00:42:44,328
introducing a bunch of different very a

982
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:46,639
bunch of different variables and a bunch

983
00:42:44,329 --> 00:42:48,680
of their ability between studies in

984
00:42:46,639 --> 00:42:51,139
which case you can't start to compile

985
00:42:48,679 --> 00:42:53,358
this this big data set right you want to

986
00:42:51,139 --> 00:42:55,068
keep the way you collect the data to say

987
00:42:53,358 --> 00:42:56,989
in the methodology the same even if it

988
00:42:55,068 --> 00:42:58,849
is across rounds because that way you

989
00:42:56,989 --> 00:43:02,239
can compare these data to previous

990
00:42:58,849 --> 00:43:04,430
rounds which is super important because

991
00:43:02,239 --> 00:43:07,039
otherwise these just become tiny little

992
00:43:04,429 --> 00:43:11,568
standalone experiments when in fact we

993
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:16,028
want to have a big kind of overarching

994
00:43:11,568 --> 00:43:19,338
data set that spans rooms that spans

995
00:43:16,028 --> 00:43:21,139
strains and time and again the way to do

996
00:43:19,338 --> 00:43:24,018
that is to hold how you collect the data

997
00:43:21,139 --> 00:43:26,268
constant and I just wanna throw in a

998
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:28,608
real quick shameless sales pitch here so

999
00:43:26,268 --> 00:43:30,108
if you are interested in blue mats I

1000
00:43:28,608 --> 00:43:32,748
think Ben and I have worked out some

1001
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:35,748
really great designs and Ben is actually

1002
00:43:32,748 --> 00:43:37,639
helping me now with the blue mat designs

1003
00:43:35,748 --> 00:43:40,728
and everything so if you're interested

1004
00:43:37,639 --> 00:43:43,308
in a custom blue mat setup for you know

1005
00:43:40,728 --> 00:43:45,679
whether it's it's beds or containers or

1006
00:43:43,309 --> 00:43:48,769
greenhouse or out there fields please

1007
00:43:45,679 --> 00:43:50,328
shoot shoot me an email and I'll put you

1008
00:43:48,768 --> 00:43:51,858
in touch with Ben and we can get

1009
00:43:50,329 --> 00:43:53,660
something set up for you we're working

1010
00:43:51,858 --> 00:43:55,699
with a variety of different designs

1011
00:43:53,659 --> 00:43:58,038
right now for people and it's uh it's

1012
00:43:55,699 --> 00:44:00,558
been a lot of fun yeah it's a blast it's

1013
00:43:58,039 --> 00:44:02,420
really cool great well I know you have a

1014
00:44:00,559 --> 00:44:04,009
couple other papers that you're or

1015
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:06,259
trials that you're running right now in

1016
00:44:04,009 --> 00:44:08,239
the facility that you we haven't quite

1017
00:44:06,259 --> 00:44:09,650
gotten all the data on yet but I wanted

1018
00:44:08,239 --> 00:44:10,869
to just mention them since I'm going to

1019
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:13,130
have you on the phone here and we'll

1020
00:44:10,869 --> 00:44:14,930
we'll get you back on possibly to talk

1021
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:15,890
about and when the papers are done but

1022
00:44:14,929 --> 00:44:17,868
tell me a little bit about your

1023
00:44:15,889 --> 00:44:19,429
experience with mammoth PE I know you

1024
00:44:17,869 --> 00:44:20,840
guys got some samples from them and you

1025
00:44:19,429 --> 00:44:23,059
started playing around with it

1026
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:25,430
we're collecting some data can you talk

1027
00:44:23,059 --> 00:44:27,049
a little bit about that yeah totally

1028
00:44:25,429 --> 00:44:29,629
well the folks over at mammoth P were

1029
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:32,960
super gracious and gave us about a

1030
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:37,700
gallon of their stuff to kind of poke

1031
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:41,150
around and play around with and it was

1032
00:44:37,699 --> 00:44:43,879
we we were we've tested many different

1033
00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:47,960
kind of microbial and mycorrhizal

1034
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:52,450
concoctions before so we had a good

1035
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:57,380
system set up already for testing this

1036
00:44:52,449 --> 00:44:58,759
already in place so we we the the the

1037
00:44:57,380 --> 00:45:00,890
label actually does a really great job

1038
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:03,080
of making it you know the instructions

1039
00:45:00,889 --> 00:45:05,299
are basically on how often and how much

1040
00:45:03,079 --> 00:45:08,119
the dilution ratios and and when to

1041
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:10,970
apply it so we wanted to get this stuff

1042
00:45:08,119 --> 00:45:15,069
into the ground and into the plants as

1043
00:45:10,969 --> 00:45:18,259
fast as possible so we didn't really

1044
00:45:15,070 --> 00:45:20,720
start it off with a like I would say a

1045
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:23,690
controlled kind of method all

1046
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:25,369
methodological setup we just kind of

1047
00:45:23,690 --> 00:45:27,380
said let's get it in there and see what

1048
00:45:25,369 --> 00:45:30,650
happens so this is you know some

1049
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:32,900
preliminary data that's again not really

1050
00:45:30,650 --> 00:45:36,680
set up you know like a full-blown

1051
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:39,860
scientific experiment but even with that

1052
00:45:36,679 --> 00:45:42,889
one run in that one room we got about a

1053
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:46,849
12% bump in wet weight harvests across

1054
00:45:42,889 --> 00:45:50,960
all screens using mammoth pee as a kind

1055
00:45:46,849 --> 00:45:52,309
of soil microbial additive so we're

1056
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:54,409
trying to work with the folks in Mammoth

1057
00:45:52,309 --> 00:45:58,579
PETA to maybe get a little bit more soil

1058
00:45:54,409 --> 00:46:02,179
and do a really robust trial with that

1059
00:45:58,579 --> 00:46:05,299
because that's a very easy thing to

1060
00:46:02,179 --> 00:46:08,149
figure out as far as well if I buy this

1061
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:11,110
much but I get this much in return it's

1062
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:14,300
a very easy cost-benefit analysis to run

1063
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:17,900
to do that so the mammoth T trials are

1064
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:20,720
still ongoing as well again the gold

1065
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:24,139
leaf facility has morphed into this

1066
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:25,699
awesome lab and and just being able to

1067
00:46:24,139 --> 00:46:27,679
test all these different products and

1068
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:29,559
and get some data behind these things

1069
00:46:27,679 --> 00:46:31,339
has been really really cool

1070
00:46:29,559 --> 00:46:33,019
yeah I'm looking forward to see the

1071
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:33,940
research on that I was a little bit

1072
00:46:33,019 --> 00:46:36,280
surprised

1073
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:38,190
I I looked at the mammoth pee under the

1074
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:40,390
microscope it's one of the only

1075
00:46:38,190 --> 00:46:42,429
microbial products on the market that

1076
00:46:40,389 --> 00:46:44,799
I'm aware of that's bottled and still

1077
00:46:42,429 --> 00:46:49,750
has motile bacteria which i think is

1078
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:52,510
cool it's I did do a video on YouTube

1079
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:56,650
brewing it and adding a variety of food

1080
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:59,190
sources to see if I could increase the

1081
00:46:56,650 --> 00:47:00,849
biology in there and maintain the same

1082
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:03,849
microorganisms and it looked like at

1083
00:47:00,849 --> 00:47:06,130
least three of the four survived but I

1084
00:47:03,849 --> 00:47:09,579
know they don't necessarily encourage

1085
00:47:06,130 --> 00:47:11,079
that I was I was quite impressed though

1086
00:47:09,579 --> 00:47:13,869
that you got the results that you did I

1087
00:47:11,079 --> 00:47:15,640
do see a lot of soil tests where the

1088
00:47:13,869 --> 00:47:16,990
mela 3 test which is the one that kind

1089
00:47:15,639 --> 00:47:19,929
of tells you everything that's on the

1090
00:47:16,989 --> 00:47:22,419
soil will show very high levels of

1091
00:47:19,929 --> 00:47:23,739
phosphorous I sea levels upwards of 700

1092
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:26,650
to a thousand pounds per acre

1093
00:47:23,739 --> 00:47:29,078
sometimes it's crazy way more than any

1094
00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:30,789
way way way more than you need and then

1095
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:32,619
you'll see very low available phosphorus

1096
00:47:30,789 --> 00:47:34,239
whether it's because of the pH or

1097
00:47:32,619 --> 00:47:36,039
because you don't have the right

1098
00:47:34,239 --> 00:47:38,439
microbes to make the phosphorous

1099
00:47:36,039 --> 00:47:40,509
available for the plant that's where I

1100
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:43,960
think mammoths pee is a really

1101
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:46,150
interesting option for people yeah I

1102
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:48,400
agree I think the the way we're kind of

1103
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:50,858
looking at it is right we have these

1104
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:53,920
kind of big macronutrients sitting in

1105
00:47:50,858 --> 00:47:56,889
the soil and just by kind of increasing

1106
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:58,240
the the chefs so to speak right the

1107
00:47:56,889 --> 00:48:00,129
little the little cooks that can make

1108
00:47:58,239 --> 00:48:01,629
this stuff and chop these things up and

1109
00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:04,869
make them more readily available to the

1110
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:06,608
plants at a faster rate maybe what what

1111
00:48:04,869 --> 00:48:07,960
we're seeing here drive these these

1112
00:48:06,608 --> 00:48:10,690
yields is just a little bit better

1113
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:13,000
yeah and mammoth peas something that we

1114
00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:15,550
you know I call ins cons an old friend I

1115
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:17,829
really like the company and what he's

1116
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:19,420
doing and so yeah please don't hesitate

1117
00:48:17,829 --> 00:48:20,800
to reach out to on the mammoth pea thing

1118
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:23,380
if people are interested in finding out

1119
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:24,940
more or I might be able to get get them

1120
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:26,769
to send you a sample or I can send you a

1121
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:28,510
sample if you're local because they've

1122
00:48:26,769 --> 00:48:32,530
dropped some off just the other day in

1123
00:48:28,510 --> 00:48:34,630
our store so wonderful so let's talk

1124
00:48:32,530 --> 00:48:38,319
about the one that I think I'm most

1125
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:40,769
excited for which is this generically

1126
00:48:38,318 --> 00:48:44,409
you could say it's an LED versus HPS

1127
00:48:40,769 --> 00:48:46,989
conversation but more specifically

1128
00:48:44,409 --> 00:48:50,139
we we have some lights that you guys set

1129
00:48:46,989 --> 00:48:52,299
up from BIOS lighting which is uh I've

1130
00:48:50,139 --> 00:48:56,440
had Rebecca on the podcast they're the

1131
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:59,920
the NASA founded led company and your

1132
00:48:56,440 --> 00:49:02,950
current technology which was Dublin in

1133
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:04,659
HP s because you guys were kind of when

1134
00:49:02,949 --> 00:49:08,649
Nate first set the facility there really

1135
00:49:04,659 --> 00:49:11,739
wasn't the research around LEDs and the

1136
00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:13,000
price point was so high right now he's

1137
00:49:11,739 --> 00:49:15,159
looking now you guys are looking into

1138
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,900
what's the cost benefit of switching

1139
00:49:15,159 --> 00:49:18,519
over to LEDs and I think this is a

1140
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:21,220
really interesting trial and a question

1141
00:49:18,519 --> 00:49:22,659
that a lot of people wonder they answer

1142
00:49:21,219 --> 00:49:25,000
to you like are they worth the

1143
00:49:22,659 --> 00:49:26,920
additional cost yeah it was great

1144
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,809
Rebecca actually came to gold leaf a

1145
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:31,269
couple of weeks ago and and her and I

1146
00:49:28,809 --> 00:49:33,809
sat down and and came up with these

1147
00:49:31,269 --> 00:49:36,610
really you know kind of elaborate

1148
00:49:33,809 --> 00:49:39,909
different ways we can try to get at the

1149
00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:42,670
the you know how well an LED does for a

1150
00:49:39,909 --> 00:49:45,159
certain plant for cannabis and it was

1151
00:49:42,670 --> 00:49:49,090
just a total nerd out session it was it

1152
00:49:45,159 --> 00:49:50,859
was great and we we actually started

1153
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:54,400
with kind of working backwards right

1154
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:56,200
we're again me and her could go down any

1155
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:58,539
which way path to find the mechanisms

1156
00:49:56,199 --> 00:50:01,149
for you know as its spectrum is it

1157
00:49:58,539 --> 00:50:03,639
chlorophyll profiles all this kind of

1158
00:50:01,150 --> 00:50:05,349
stuff but really what what folks want to

1159
00:50:03,639 --> 00:50:08,879
know is am I going to grow more am I

1160
00:50:05,349 --> 00:50:12,369
going to grow better quality and if I do

1161
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:14,890
how much do I have to grow to recoup

1162
00:50:12,369 --> 00:50:17,349
what I spent on top of what I could

1163
00:50:14,889 --> 00:50:19,170
normally have spent on you know some

1164
00:50:17,349 --> 00:50:21,219
some older you know cheaper technology

1165
00:50:19,170 --> 00:50:22,900
so the first thing we're gonna do is

1166
00:50:21,219 --> 00:50:24,279
we're coming out with a white paper here

1167
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:28,090
pretty soon where we've actually

1168
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:31,240
analyzed some of our electricity like

1169
00:50:28,090 --> 00:50:34,960
our utility load data to try to parse

1170
00:50:31,239 --> 00:50:37,689
out how many cycles how many harvests we

1171
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:41,860
would need in order to recoup the price

1172
00:50:37,690 --> 00:50:43,450
of installing these BIOS lights in one

1173
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:45,460
of our rooms so that hopefully should be

1174
00:50:43,449 --> 00:50:48,699
coming out here pretty soon and then the

1175
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:53,740
next one we're doing is actually just

1176
00:50:48,699 --> 00:50:56,559
going to be another another trial of you

1177
00:50:53,739 --> 00:50:58,179
know setting up we have it's eight of

1178
00:50:56,559 --> 00:51:01,838
these BIOS lights and one of the flower

1179
00:50:58,179 --> 00:51:05,230
and all around the outer edge are the

1180
00:51:01,838 --> 00:51:06,818
the old kind of HPS fixtures we did put

1181
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:09,730
brand-new bulbs in those though so we

1182
00:51:06,818 --> 00:51:11,588
could try to get you know as even of a

1183
00:51:09,730 --> 00:51:13,358
comparison as possible where if you say

1184
00:51:11,588 --> 00:51:15,338
I'm gonna buy brand-new this or a brand

1185
00:51:13,358 --> 00:51:16,929
new that again you want to make sure

1186
00:51:15,338 --> 00:51:19,239
that you're not you know I want to I

1187
00:51:16,929 --> 00:51:21,098
don't want to compare a brand new BIOS

1188
00:51:19,239 --> 00:51:23,318
to an HP s that's been hanging there for

1189
00:51:21,099 --> 00:51:26,890
two or three years right because that's

1190
00:51:23,318 --> 00:51:28,449
not a totally fair comparison so I put

1191
00:51:26,889 --> 00:51:31,838
brand-new bulbs and all of the you know

1192
00:51:28,449 --> 00:51:35,558
the PHP s lights that we're going to run

1193
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:38,650
against the BIOS and then this time

1194
00:51:35,559 --> 00:51:40,960
though we we did come up with some kind

1195
00:51:38,650 --> 00:51:45,160
of a data collection workflow that we

1196
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:47,679
will be able to target the DRI waits for

1197
00:51:45,159 --> 00:51:50,348
the strains in in this flower room so

1198
00:51:47,679 --> 00:51:51,909
we're going to make sure we don't only

1199
00:51:50,349 --> 00:51:54,039
have the harvest way but we want to see

1200
00:51:51,909 --> 00:51:56,889
that wet wait that harvest wait

1201
00:51:54,039 --> 00:52:00,520
translate into sellable actual product

1202
00:51:56,889 --> 00:52:04,000
and see if if that actually makes a

1203
00:52:00,519 --> 00:52:08,199
difference so that those lights were put

1204
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:10,260
up there a couple months ago now so the

1205
00:52:08,199 --> 00:52:12,189
end of the harvest for that one room

1206
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:15,490
should be happening here in the next

1207
00:52:12,190 --> 00:52:18,099
couple weeks and which case we have our

1208
00:52:15,489 --> 00:52:19,989
controls already set up so we want to

1209
00:52:18,099 --> 00:52:22,210
make sure that the mothers are treated

1210
00:52:19,989 --> 00:52:23,618
the same we want to make sure that the

1211
00:52:22,210 --> 00:52:25,079
clones are treated the same we want to

1212
00:52:23,619 --> 00:52:27,760
make sure that you know the young

1213
00:52:25,079 --> 00:52:30,190
vegetative stages are treated the same

1214
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:33,670
and then the only possible difference

1215
00:52:30,190 --> 00:52:35,650
would be when exposed to the BIOS lights

1216
00:52:33,670 --> 00:52:37,568
or the SPH lights with the new bulbs

1217
00:52:35,650 --> 00:52:39,160
once they get transferred into that

1218
00:52:37,568 --> 00:52:41,199
flower room and that should be happening

1219
00:52:39,159 --> 00:52:43,058
here like I said in the next two or

1220
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:44,949
three weeks and then you're also

1221
00:52:43,059 --> 00:52:46,420
randomizing those clones too so you're

1222
00:52:44,949 --> 00:52:47,858
not setting aside at the very beginning

1223
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:49,389
these ones are gonna go under BIOS

1224
00:52:47,858 --> 00:52:51,759
because they look great and these are

1225
00:52:49,389 --> 00:52:56,199
gonna go right HPS your your yeah you

1226
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:58,390
know it's funny how easy human bias can

1227
00:52:56,199 --> 00:53:00,489
kind of creep in there where you know

1228
00:52:58,389 --> 00:53:03,308
you and it's not even a purposeful thing

1229
00:53:00,489 --> 00:53:04,269
right to say well I want you know if I'm

1230
00:53:03,309 --> 00:53:05,920
going to spend the money on the BIOS

1231
00:53:04,269 --> 00:53:08,380
lights I want these results to look good

1232
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:10,088
and then almost subconsciously you're

1233
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:11,920
gonna look and put all those you know

1234
00:53:10,088 --> 00:53:14,980
the best tallest clothes

1235
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:16,150
under into the BIOS lights so one of the

1236
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:17,380
things we're gonna be doing is where I

1237
00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:19,989
can actually be yeah like you said

1238
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:21,220
randomizing the clones so let's say

1239
00:53:19,989 --> 00:53:23,199
we're going to be using a hundred and

1240
00:53:21,219 --> 00:53:25,238
twenty plants each one of those 120

1241
00:53:23,199 --> 00:53:29,679
plants are gonna get assigned a number

1242
00:53:25,239 --> 00:53:32,829
and then that number will be thrown into

1243
00:53:29,679 --> 00:53:36,639
a randomly generated number sequence and

1244
00:53:32,829 --> 00:53:39,400
then those will decide which of the

1245
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:40,778
clones goes into under the BIOS lights

1246
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:43,239
treatment and which of the clones go

1247
00:53:40,778 --> 00:53:45,659
under the DHBs lights treatment so again

1248
00:53:43,239 --> 00:53:49,079
it does it's you just want to try to

1249
00:53:45,659 --> 00:53:51,998
weed out and get rid of as many of the

1250
00:53:49,079 --> 00:53:53,710
diocese or preconceived kind of notions

1251
00:53:51,998 --> 00:53:56,738
to try to really get down to the core

1252
00:53:53,710 --> 00:53:57,818
data for the question you're asking now

1253
00:53:56,739 --> 00:53:59,769
tell me about what you're seeing

1254
00:53:57,818 --> 00:54:02,558
anecdotally so far because I know you've

1255
00:53:59,768 --> 00:54:04,358
already flowered some plants under the

1256
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:05,769
bio slides but you didn't weren't set up

1257
00:54:04,358 --> 00:54:07,900
to actually collect that data and I

1258
00:54:05,768 --> 00:54:10,149
realize there's issues around lighting

1259
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:12,278
intensity and getting the plants used to

1260
00:54:10,150 --> 00:54:16,150
a different spectrum so those things can

1261
00:54:12,278 --> 00:54:18,068
all affect it but so yeah it's pretty

1262
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:19,930
interesting i I poked my head into this

1263
00:54:18,068 --> 00:54:22,659
to this room the other day and I was

1264
00:54:19,929 --> 00:54:25,509
pretty taken aback by how tall the

1265
00:54:22,659 --> 00:54:28,868
plants were that were under the full

1266
00:54:25,509 --> 00:54:31,298
spectrum of the bio slights meaning you

1267
00:54:28,869 --> 00:54:33,068
know the BIOS lights because they're

1268
00:54:31,298 --> 00:54:35,139
LEDs they have a little bit more of a

1269
00:54:33,068 --> 00:54:37,719
focused area that they cover right

1270
00:54:35,139 --> 00:54:41,108
there's not such a splash zone that you

1271
00:54:37,719 --> 00:54:43,838
might get with an HP s so if you're off

1272
00:54:41,108 --> 00:54:45,759
center or you know off set a certain

1273
00:54:43,838 --> 00:54:48,338
amount of feet from these lights to the

1274
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:50,079
intensity goes down pretty quick and we

1275
00:54:48,338 --> 00:54:53,349
actually just happen to have three of

1276
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:54,759
the same strains grown next to each

1277
00:54:53,349 --> 00:54:57,338
other in three different in you know

1278
00:54:54,759 --> 00:54:59,829
three different beds and the ones that

1279
00:54:57,338 --> 00:55:03,880
were fully under the bios lights were

1280
00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:06,700
probably a good foot and a half to two

1281
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:09,940
feet taller than the ones that were

1282
00:55:06,699 --> 00:55:11,588
grown just out of the reach of the BIOS

1283
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:14,588
lights and kind of under this probably

1284
00:55:11,588 --> 00:55:17,038
mixed spectrum of LED and HP s kind of

1285
00:55:14,588 --> 00:55:20,650
wash out you know ambient kind of light

1286
00:55:17,039 --> 00:55:22,720
so that they look much much bigger now

1287
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:24,278
of course we want to make sure that you

1288
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:25,659
know bigger means better and that's why

1289
00:55:24,278 --> 00:55:27,369
we're really got a target the left

1290
00:55:25,659 --> 00:55:29,980
right where if we're getting taller

1291
00:55:27,369 --> 00:55:31,750
plants that might be great but if you've

1292
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:34,449
got more internodal spacing and they get

1293
00:55:31,750 --> 00:55:36,750
stretchy you might not actually get the

1294
00:55:34,449 --> 00:55:41,710
result you're looking for you might have

1295
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:43,539
less buds or not as big you know stuff

1296
00:55:41,710 --> 00:55:45,659
like that so that's why the data you

1297
00:55:43,539 --> 00:55:47,799
really you know you want to capture does

1298
00:55:45,659 --> 00:55:50,170
really get out the question because like

1299
00:55:47,798 --> 00:55:52,059
like you really even saying bigger is

1300
00:55:50,170 --> 00:55:55,659
not always better you know bigger might

1301
00:55:52,059 --> 00:55:58,150
be great but if it comes down to what

1302
00:55:55,659 --> 00:55:59,710
you're actually selling a customer you

1303
00:55:58,150 --> 00:56:03,400
know it that might not actually still

1304
00:55:59,710 --> 00:56:05,798
hold true by that point so it's uh the

1305
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:08,200
results look pretty awesome we're

1306
00:56:05,798 --> 00:56:10,199
getting much bigger flowering plants but

1307
00:56:08,199 --> 00:56:13,328
we got to make sure that translates into

1308
00:56:10,199 --> 00:56:16,538
you know jar bowl or processable product

1309
00:56:13,329 --> 00:56:18,490
down the line yeah and then also testing

1310
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:20,589
the final bud to see what sort of

1311
00:56:18,489 --> 00:56:22,358
cannabinoid expression you're getting to

1312
00:56:20,588 --> 00:56:23,889
I think is important what terpene levels

1313
00:56:22,358 --> 00:56:25,210
and see cuz those those will all change

1314
00:56:23,889 --> 00:56:27,909
with lighting spectrum that's fairly

1315
00:56:25,210 --> 00:56:29,380
well established so yeah exactly the

1316
00:56:27,909 --> 00:56:32,230
hypothesis is that we'll see an

1317
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:35,108
improvement in all of that - and I want

1318
00:56:32,230 --> 00:56:37,630
to give credit to outcault and dr.

1319
00:56:35,108 --> 00:56:39,449
Alison justice because this is a this is

1320
00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:41,798
an experiment they've already done using

1321
00:56:39,449 --> 00:56:44,710
fluence lighting looking at an ROI

1322
00:56:41,798 --> 00:56:46,719
compared to HP s that's a study they

1323
00:56:44,710 --> 00:56:49,170
completed oh I think two three years ago

1324
00:56:46,719 --> 00:56:51,969
and that's available as well I believe

1325
00:56:49,170 --> 00:56:53,559
so this is sort of a replication of that

1326
00:56:51,969 --> 00:56:56,199
in a different facility to hopefully

1327
00:56:53,559 --> 00:56:58,809
support what what that data already

1328
00:56:56,199 --> 00:57:00,818
showed right again it's all about just

1329
00:56:58,809 --> 00:57:03,369
supporting previous data that's been

1330
00:57:00,818 --> 00:57:04,989
there or refuting it and if you're

1331
00:57:03,369 --> 00:57:06,338
refuting it then you're gonna you know

1332
00:57:04,989 --> 00:57:07,808
you want to figure out and what the

1333
00:57:06,338 --> 00:57:10,000
differences are and if you can control

1334
00:57:07,809 --> 00:57:12,220
those great if not then you know you go

1335
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,690
from there but it's it's all everybody

1336
00:57:12,219 --> 00:57:16,419
is just trying to figure out the best

1337
00:57:13,690 --> 00:57:19,480
way to do the same thing and it's it's

1338
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:21,759
great to actually have you know some of

1339
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:24,068
these scientists and other other folks

1340
00:57:21,759 --> 00:57:26,920
that are so committed to the to the

1341
00:57:24,068 --> 00:57:29,318
plant to start to hone in on it it's

1342
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:31,329
really it's really exciting very cool

1343
00:57:29,318 --> 00:57:32,710
well Ben we're getting a little longer

1344
00:57:31,329 --> 00:57:33,789
in this podcast and we haven't even

1345
00:57:32,710 --> 00:57:37,778
gotten to the thing that I'm most

1346
00:57:33,789 --> 00:57:39,430
excited about announcing so one of the

1347
00:57:37,778 --> 00:57:43,719
things that's happened in the past

1348
00:57:39,429 --> 00:57:46,838
oh let's say six to eight months now Ben

1349
00:57:43,719 --> 00:57:48,848
myself and Nathan Gibbs who's the owner

1350
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:53,380
of goldleaf have formed a separate

1351
00:57:48,849 --> 00:57:55,230
company it's called Kaizen consulting do

1352
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:59,230
you want talking about what Kaizen means

1353
00:57:55,230 --> 00:58:01,838
yeah Kaizen comes from the old Japanese

1354
00:57:59,230 --> 00:58:04,659
manufacturing methodology of continuous

1355
00:58:01,838 --> 00:58:06,608
improvement right so just like we are

1356
00:58:04,659 --> 00:58:08,259
doing now with testing different things

1357
00:58:06,608 --> 00:58:10,179
and different products and and gold

1358
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:13,349
Leafs been kind of the forefront on this

1359
00:58:10,179 --> 00:58:15,699
is we just want to continuously improve

1360
00:58:13,349 --> 00:58:18,400
you know much like your podcast right

1361
00:58:15,699 --> 00:58:22,779
just the cultivation of cannabis

1362
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:26,410
so what Kaizen is is basically that kind

1363
00:58:22,780 --> 00:58:29,109
of philosophy put in to put into a

1364
00:58:26,409 --> 00:58:31,059
business a consulting business yeah I'm

1365
00:58:29,108 --> 00:58:33,489
so excited about this because I I get

1366
00:58:31,059 --> 00:58:35,529
requests almost daily for consulting

1367
00:58:33,489 --> 00:58:38,500
whether it's about soil or facility

1368
00:58:35,530 --> 00:58:40,780
design or just a variety of questions

1369
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:43,210
from literally all over the world it's

1370
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:45,849
pretty amazing mostly because of this

1371
00:58:43,210 --> 00:58:49,568
podcast and frankly I didn't feel

1372
00:58:45,849 --> 00:58:51,099
qualified to offer a consulting on a lot

1373
00:58:49,568 --> 00:58:53,920
of things I know what I know and I know

1374
00:58:51,099 --> 00:58:56,980
what I don't know and so the opportunity

1375
00:58:53,920 --> 00:59:00,250
to partner with Nate who has been

1376
00:58:56,980 --> 00:59:03,849
running you know facilities multiple

1377
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:06,309
hundred light grows for oh geez decades

1378
00:59:03,849 --> 00:59:08,500
now he's been doing from back in the

1379
00:59:06,309 --> 00:59:11,409
medical days and he's been successful at

1380
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:13,380
it in a very very challenging Washington

1381
00:59:11,409 --> 00:59:17,469
market where a lot of people are failing

1382
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:19,568
they've created you know the this brand

1383
00:59:17,469 --> 00:59:21,459
this high-end brand based on the

1384
00:59:19,568 --> 00:59:22,960
consistency and quality of their flower

1385
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:25,750
where they're still getting top dollar

1386
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:30,400
and it's pretty amazing and I think a

1387
00:59:25,750 --> 00:59:34,108
lot of that is the communities created

1388
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:36,519
they're the the worker community the the

1389
00:59:34,108 --> 00:59:39,068
thoughtfulness he's put into both the

1390
00:59:36,519 --> 00:59:40,630
cultivation and the marketing of the

1391
00:59:39,068 --> 00:59:42,039
product and I love it because he's

1392
00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:43,809
always sending me these books to read

1393
00:59:42,039 --> 00:59:45,608
and quoting these other books he's all

1394
00:59:43,809 --> 00:59:46,929
continuously learning and it really fits

1395
00:59:45,608 --> 00:59:50,650
with the name of the consulting group

1396
00:59:46,929 --> 00:59:52,299
and and Ben is really bringing the the

1397
00:59:50,650 --> 00:59:53,710
research and science aspect

1398
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:56,710
so that were able to start collecting

1399
00:59:53,710 --> 00:59:58,420
data and and have data-driven answers

1400
00:59:56,710 --> 01:00:02,280
for people that are coming to me and

1401
00:59:58,420 --> 01:00:04,269
coming to us as a consulting group so

1402
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:06,550
super excited for that

1403
01:00:04,269 --> 01:00:07,869
the idea behind like what I want to make

1404
01:00:06,550 --> 01:00:09,850
sure we contribute to the whole

1405
01:00:07,869 --> 01:00:12,219
operation here the whole kind of

1406
01:00:09,849 --> 01:00:14,079
collective think-tank that is growing

1407
01:00:12,219 --> 01:00:16,869
cannabis is I I don't I don't want to

1408
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:19,179
come up with something that says oh this

1409
01:00:16,869 --> 01:00:21,400
this products great without having a

1410
01:00:19,179 --> 01:00:24,039
graph or some kind of data or some kind

1411
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:25,389
of trial or study to say why this

1412
01:00:24,039 --> 01:00:27,579
product is great or why this product

1413
01:00:25,389 --> 01:00:31,210
isn't great I mean ultimately again it

1414
01:00:27,579 --> 01:00:33,340
is up to whatever farm or garden to make

1415
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:37,000
up their own mind but you know there

1416
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:39,880
with this market coming online so

1417
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:42,340
rapidly and what everyone I think is

1418
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:44,590
assuming to be so massively

1419
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:46,750
is that you're gonna start to see a lot

1420
01:00:44,590 --> 01:00:49,809
of things being sold that will promise

1421
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:51,130
so many different things and we're

1422
01:00:49,809 --> 01:00:53,710
already seeing that some of these things

1423
01:00:51,130 --> 01:00:56,050
do work and some of these things we

1424
01:00:53,710 --> 01:00:59,050
don't see you know at least and the way

1425
01:00:56,050 --> 01:01:00,820
we do things what they claim to do so

1426
01:00:59,050 --> 01:01:03,220
what we want to make sure is we want to

1427
01:01:00,820 --> 01:01:05,370
continuously improve how things are

1428
01:01:03,219 --> 01:01:07,929
grown if it can be an organic

1429
01:01:05,369 --> 01:01:10,359
sustainable fashion that's all the

1430
01:01:07,929 --> 01:01:11,589
better and which of these new products

1431
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:13,300
that are coming online from all these

1432
01:01:11,590 --> 01:01:15,960
different companies are going to make

1433
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:18,880
that happen and the most kind of

1434
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:21,039
economical and like I said sustainable

1435
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:21,760
way yeah so if you're listening this

1436
01:01:21,039 --> 01:01:23,050
podcast

1437
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:25,570
you've probably heard my voice way too

1438
01:01:23,050 --> 01:01:27,250
much and you know kind of my opinions

1439
01:01:25,570 --> 01:01:30,010
and thoughts you've now heard a little

1440
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:32,320
bit from Ben I did do a podcast with

1441
01:01:30,010 --> 01:01:34,270
Nate Gibbs you can actually watch that

1442
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:36,250
one on YouTube you can see us we're in a

1443
01:01:34,269 --> 01:01:39,400
coffee shop chatting not so much about

1444
01:01:36,250 --> 01:01:40,800
the the cultivation aspect of things but

1445
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:43,329
more about like lean manufacturing

1446
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:45,280
farming and some of the other aspects of

1447
01:01:43,329 --> 01:01:48,369
running a business but that's an

1448
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:50,110
interesting podcast and then we found

1449
01:01:48,369 --> 01:01:52,119
that there were still gaps in sort of

1450
01:01:50,110 --> 01:01:54,370
our consulting knowledge where we wanted

1451
01:01:52,119 --> 01:01:55,779
to fill those with the top minds that we

1452
01:01:54,369 --> 01:01:59,259
knew in the industry and so we've

1453
01:01:55,780 --> 01:02:02,740
partnered with dr. Allison justice who's

1454
01:01:59,260 --> 01:02:05,260
amazing and has done some done some real

1455
01:02:02,739 --> 01:02:05,949
work for this industry you can listen to

1456
01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:08,500
her pod

1457
01:02:05,949 --> 01:02:11,439
asked on on the show as well and then

1458
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:13,510
also Chris Jagger so Alison really has a

1459
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:17,559
lot of experience now with hemp and

1460
01:02:13,510 --> 01:02:20,320
extraction and cultivating as

1461
01:02:17,559 --> 01:02:22,420
sustainably as you can with using you

1462
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:27,070
know chemical nutrients in sort of this

1463
01:02:22,420 --> 01:02:29,980
multi tier led vertical vertical growing

1464
01:02:27,070 --> 01:02:32,829
systems and then Chris Jagger is really

1465
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:35,019
experienced in sort of outdoor or hemp

1466
01:02:32,829 --> 01:02:37,869
