welcome to the cannabis cultivation and

3
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:22,379
science podcast

4
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:24,689
I'm your host tad hussy of KISS organics

5
00:00:22,379 --> 00:00:26,009
this is the podcast where we discuss the

6
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:27,929
cutting edge of growing from a

7
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:29,550
science-based perspective and drawn top

8
00:00:27,929 --> 00:00:31,469
experts from around the industry to

9
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:33,270
share their wisdom and knowledge now

10
00:00:31,469 --> 00:00:34,738
before starting the podcast I want to

11
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,960
catch you up on a few things going on

12
00:00:34,738 --> 00:00:38,939
with dis organics we've been working on

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,679
a seed starter mix that is now available

14
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:42,359
on the website that is affordable and

15
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:44,460
works great with both cannabis and

16
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:46,019
veggies I've also been working for the

17
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,058
past two years on a soil mix

18
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,340
collaboration with black swallow living

19
00:00:48,058 --> 00:00:52,619
soils in Canada and that mix is now

20
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,239
available for folks in Canada as well as

21
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:56,820
a version of our nutrient packed for

22
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:58,378
reinventing soils and since many of us

23
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,149
are stuck at home during this global

24
00:00:58,378 --> 00:01:01,948
pandemic I thought it would be a good

25
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:03,689
time to do some virtual tours of some

26
00:01:01,948 --> 00:01:05,728
commercial grow facilities and field

27
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:07,140
live questions while we talked to the

28
00:01:05,728 --> 00:01:09,750
head grower about some of their biggest

29
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,340
successes and failures will be hosting

30
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,109
these on Instagram and I'll be

31
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:16,109
announcing the date soon so be sure to

32
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:17,670
give us a follow at kis organics if you

33
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:20,009

check it out getting on with the podcast

35
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:24,150
Dick's this week's podcast is all about

36
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:26,640
pest management and is a two-part

37
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:29,310
interview with Kelly Vance Kelly came to

38
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,739
beneficial insect eree in 2016 after a

39
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:33,509
17-year career in greenhouse ornamental

40
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:35,789
and landscape pest management with a

41
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:38,069
strong focus on biological controls and

42
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:40,020
soft chemistry since joined the team in

43
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:42,029
reading he's worked in a wide variety of

44
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:43,950
ornamental food and hemp cannabis crops

45
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:46,228
developing bow control programs for a

46
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,060
myriad of crop pests he has written

47
00:01:46,228 --> 00:01:49,679
company literature and is developing a

48
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,140
series of release videos for the

49
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,118
beneficial website as well Kelly moved

50
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,700
to reading from Salem Oregon in November

51
00:01:54,118 --> 00:01:58,438
2018 and covered the western United

52
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,630
States for beneficial insect era before

53
00:01:58,438 --> 00:02:03,148
moving into the IPM technical lead

54
00:02:00,629 --> 00:02:05,399
position coordinating the IPM teams

55
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:08,770
support of customers all over the United

56
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:11,379
States and Canada now onto the show

57
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:14,000
hey Kelly thanks for coming on the show

58
00:02:11,379 --> 00:02:16,419
hey Ted thanks for having me I

59
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,379
appreciate it I appreciate your patience

60
00:02:16,419 --> 00:02:20,689
yeah I took a little while to put this

61
00:02:18,379 --> 00:02:22,460
together I know you're a very very busy

62
00:02:20,689 --> 00:02:26,150
guy or at least you were before all this

63
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:27,950
virus stuff but I'm excited to get you

64
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:29,450
on here I want to start off talking a

65
00:02:27,949 --> 00:02:31,399
little bit about your background because

66
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:34,159
I think it's really interesting how you

67
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:36,230
got into working with insects can you

68
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:37,280
talk a little bit about you know even

69
00:02:36,229 --> 00:02:38,599
going back to what got you into

70
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,900
horticulture and what you did before

71
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:45,620
working at beneficial insect eree um

72
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:48,140
sure yeah it'll be a little telling of

73
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:50,870
my age because it goes back about 20

74
00:02:48,139 --> 00:02:54,708
years I actually started in pest

75
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:57,319
management at the age of 20 primarily

76
00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:59,390
doing turf and landscape it was actually

77
00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:01,879
called LNO in the state of florida lawn

78
00:02:59,389 --> 00:03:03,349
and ornamental and the company that I

79
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:06,590
worked for we also did indoor pest

80
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:10,069
control so you know at age 20 I was

81
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:12,200
really mainly dealing with cockroaches

82
00:03:10,069 --> 00:03:14,900
and ants inside of little retirement

83
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:18,109
communities in the state of Florida a

84
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:19,640
lot of turf pests a lot of pests in the

85
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:21,860
landscapes that they had put in but I

86
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:25,488
mean it was all chemical approach back

87
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:27,950
then so I learned that no bug was a good

88
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:31,519
bug and we scorched the earth for many

89
00:03:27,949 --> 00:03:33,619
many years the company that I worked for

90
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:37,640
was also really big into acquiring other

91
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:39,170
companies and eventually we bought the

92
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:40,969
nursery that we bought a lot of

93
00:03:39,169 --> 00:03:43,939
landscape plants from because we also

94
00:03:40,969 --> 00:03:47,150
had a landscape division and then it was

95
00:03:43,939 --> 00:03:49,579
just I was thrown into a greenhouse you

96
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:51,439
know it's a little bit to learn a little

97
00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:53,840
bit of a learning curve for sure was a

98
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:55,370
good thing we started small but I was

99
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,030
still really going pretty hard with

100
00:03:55,370 --> 00:04:01,849
chemicals up until you know probably the

101
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:05,479
mid 2000s and I started just seeing a

102
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:09,799
lot of pesticide resistance also just

103
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:11,750
dealing with sometimes a supply that was

104
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:15,049
limited and not being replenished as

105
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:17,569
often as it could have been so I was

106
00:04:15,049 --> 00:04:19,009
kind of dabbling into biocontrol back

107
00:04:17,569 --> 00:04:22,670
then but I'm only going to call it

108
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:24,560
dabbling it was just releasing ladybug

109
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:27,230
getting disappointed when they didn't

110
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,420
work I did do some nematodes and

111
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:31,280
actually did see some action with

112
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:33,140
nematodes against fungus gnats so it

113
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:36,169
kind of taught me yeah this thing can

114
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:39,439
work and maybe I'm not dedicating enough

115
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:42,170
time maybe I'm not doing it right so for

116
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:44,120
a while I left after almost nine years

117
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:47,090
at that company I left and started my

118
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,980
own pest control company also doing turf

119
00:04:47,089 --> 00:04:50,959
management

120
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:53,420
lawn service and tree work and pretty

121
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:56,930
much every kind of just general gardener

122
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:59,090
work sold that company back to the

123
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:02,449
company I worked for when I moved out

124
00:04:59,089 --> 00:05:05,269
west in 2011 to take a grower position

125
00:05:02,449 --> 00:05:06,769
at Fesler nursery in Oregon and this was

126
00:05:05,269 --> 00:05:09,799
different this was a professional

127
00:05:06,769 --> 00:05:11,539
nursery it was eight hundred thousand

128
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:15,470
square feet of greenhouses growing

129
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:18,200
annuals bedding plants fuchsias huge

130
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:20,750
poinsettia crop in the winter I mean it

131
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:21,949
was really a study and scaling out for

132
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:25,189
me you never would have thought that

133
00:05:21,949 --> 00:05:27,920
that's when I go into biocontrol but one

134
00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:29,750
thing that anybody from the Willamette

135
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:31,699
Valley or the Pacific Northwest that's

136
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:35,060
growing plants knows a lot about is

137
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:36,949
thrips growing up in the southeast I

138
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:38,509
know a lot about spider mites and it's

139
00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:40,250
not that I didn't know about thrips I

140
00:05:38,509 --> 00:05:43,039
just didn't know that thrips could

141
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:45,379
attack the way that they do when you get

142
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:47,800
it out on the west coast it's probably

143
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:51,829
reason their Western flower thrips and

144
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:53,990
gerbera daisies were the main one two

145
00:05:51,829 --> 00:05:56,240
years in a row I barely we could barely

146
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:58,660
sell the ones that I was putting out of

147
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:02,030
my greenhouses we were culling probably

148
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:03,980
65 70 percent of them and it was because

149
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:06,139
I couldn't kill the thrips and I had

150
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:07,759
every chemical at my disposal I was

151
00:06:06,139 --> 00:06:11,139
spraying everything that I could

152
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:14,509
rotating bringing the chemical reps out

153
00:06:11,139 --> 00:06:17,870
buying more stuff throwing more and more

154
00:06:14,509 --> 00:06:20,000
plants away and it was just I happen to

155
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:21,829
be at one of Suzanne's talks as the

156
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,529
first time I saw her talk out west I had

157
00:06:21,829 --> 00:06:27,050
seen her talk in Florida and she was

158
00:06:24,529 --> 00:06:29,959
just talking thrips and I said you know

159
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:31,970
I'm going to give this a go on that crop

160
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:33,680
it was a smaller crop I got permission

161
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:36,800
to do it

162
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:39,319
the first season that I implemented

163
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,418
biocontrol three ways we were doing

164
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:45,860
predatory mites in the canopy predatory

165
00:06:41,418 --> 00:06:48,560
mites in the soil and aureus I wasn't

166
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:51,350
using banker plants at that time we may

167
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,269
be called 35% that year and I sprayed a

168
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:55,850
lot less and then it was just like that

169
00:06:53,269 --> 00:06:58,129
was that was AI controlled drips with

170
00:06:55,850 --> 00:07:00,800
bugs instead of chemicals that was proof

171
00:06:58,129 --> 00:07:03,519
that this works the following season we

172
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:06,829
sprayed that crop twice and it was with

173
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:08,959
IG ARS both times with growth regulators

174
00:07:06,829 --> 00:07:11,418
no hard chemistry's nothing that nuked

175
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:13,728
my bio control program and it's like if

176
00:07:11,418 --> 00:07:16,639
you can grow daisies and control threats

177
00:07:13,728 --> 00:07:18,918
in them with bugs and very very soft

178
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:21,110
chemistry then to me that was all the

179
00:07:18,918 --> 00:07:24,198
proof that I needed I'm sorry I know

180
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:25,699
that was a long-winded response no

181
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:28,669
that's I think that's really interesting

182
00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:31,129
i mean this facility you're in 800,000

183
00:07:28,668 --> 00:07:32,629
square feet is just it's it's massive

184
00:07:31,129 --> 00:07:36,889
and i think the challenge of having

185
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:40,490
multiple varieties of plants in there it

186
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:42,650
just increases a lot of the I think the

187
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:44,389
IPM challenges because you will have

188
00:07:42,649 --> 00:07:46,098
plants that are just going to be like

189
00:07:44,389 --> 00:07:47,840
trap plants for a lot of these insects

190
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:49,728
it sounds like oh for sure that's a

191
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:51,918
perfect way to put it trap plants and

192
00:07:49,728 --> 00:07:54,228
you know one of the big things that I

193
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:59,139
don't see it practiced as heavily in

194
00:07:54,228 --> 00:08:01,129
cannabis or or hemp as I do in you know

195
00:07:59,139 --> 00:08:02,960
horticulture and just general

196
00:08:01,129 --> 00:08:04,519
agriculture a lot of times too

197
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:08,269
especially in Tomatoes greenhouse

198
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:10,490
Tomatoes you see what you call crop

199
00:08:08,269 --> 00:08:12,829
staging you know it's like what crop do

200
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:14,780
I want next to this crop and even if

201
00:08:12,829 --> 00:08:16,579
you're growing the same plant you're

202
00:08:14,779 --> 00:08:19,519
growing all tomatoes you have how many

203
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:21,529
different cultivars and we know some of

204
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:24,560
these are like trap plants like you said

205
00:08:21,529 --> 00:08:26,598
for pests and then when you scale it out

206
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:30,639
to where you're growing you know how

207
00:08:26,598 --> 00:08:33,439
many different kinds of plants and

208
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,969
occasionally you learn the hard way you

209
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,800
bring in a new crop that you've never

210
00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:38,419
heard of nobody at the nursery has ever

211
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,848
heard of this plant but guess what we're

212
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:45,019
going to grow ten twelve thousand square

213
00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:46,670
feet were of crop space you know at

214
00:08:45,019 --> 00:08:47,539
least in the horticulture in ornamental

215
00:08:46,669 --> 00:08:48,799
world

216
00:08:47,539 --> 00:08:50,448
a lot of times there's research out

217
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:52,099
there you can look up at least brace

218
00:08:50,448 --> 00:08:55,159
yourself a little bit for what you need

219
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:56,389
but chances are you're not only are you

220
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:57,919
bringing in this weird plant you've

221
00:08:56,389 --> 00:09:01,549
never heard of you're bringing in six or

222
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:03,919
seven cultivars of it so absolutely it

223
00:09:01,549 --> 00:09:05,828
really changes the IPM game and and in

224
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:09,049
cannabis you see the different cultivars

225
00:09:05,828 --> 00:09:11,629
different strains I mean we definitely

226
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:14,419
see this big-time you see spider mites

227
00:09:11,629 --> 00:09:16,879
all over one variety we see you know

228
00:09:14,419 --> 00:09:19,879
have breasts at my athens preferring

229
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:23,059
varieties and the crop staging was

230
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:25,669
instrumental to scale my biocontrol out

231
00:09:23,059 --> 00:09:30,439
bigger than just my Gerber a Daisy crop

232
00:09:25,669 --> 00:09:32,479
because 800,000 square feet it's not you

233
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:34,490
know two or three big ranges we had two

234
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,019
or three big ranges that were a hundred

235
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:37,639
thousand square feet or so but this

236
00:09:36,019 --> 00:09:39,980
nursery had been built out over the

237
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:43,549
course of sixty years by the time I got

238
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:45,920
there so piecemealed in a way so we'd

239
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:47,659
have you know ten greenhouses over here

240
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:50,479
that are each about 3,000 square feet

241
00:09:47,659 --> 00:09:53,000
give or take so we you know then you

242
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,039
could do small then you could stage

243
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,528
really problematic crops in there and

244
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:59,389
then just bomb them and to be frank I

245
00:09:57,528 --> 00:10:01,669
wasn't doing bugs in all of my crops

246
00:09:59,389 --> 00:10:03,589
because when you grow that many plants

247
00:10:01,669 --> 00:10:07,909
you will find one that gets a pest that

248
00:10:03,589 --> 00:10:11,360
you just can't control biologically but

249
00:10:07,909 --> 00:10:12,948
yeah that's that's huge and sometimes

250
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,949
when we work with these cannabis growers

251
00:10:12,948 --> 00:10:17,240
and I like grit my teeth embrace for the

252
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:19,698
answer when I ask them so how many

253
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:22,818
strains are you guys growing and I've

254
00:10:19,698 --> 00:10:24,979
had some really mind-blowing answers to

255
00:10:22,818 --> 00:10:27,588
that hundreds of strains and it's like

256
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:30,829
do you have any idea if these plants

257
00:10:27,589 --> 00:10:33,230
even want to be together yeah well

258
00:10:30,828 --> 00:10:36,349
there's a challenge there so I have a

259
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:38,060
few questions one what what you're

260
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:40,670
talking about with crop staging is quite

261
00:10:38,059 --> 00:10:43,059
different than companion planting now if

262
00:10:40,669 --> 00:10:47,149
we're thinking of this from an indoor

263
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:48,768
cultivation perspective and we have you

264
00:10:47,149 --> 00:10:50,839
know we're paying for electricity we're

265
00:10:48,769 --> 00:10:53,509
paying for square footage that we're

266
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:57,350
lighting up we don't want to dedicate a

267
00:10:53,509 --> 00:11:00,269
lot of space to non-productive plants or

268
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:03,778
you know non plants that we can't

269
00:11:00,269 --> 00:11:06,480
we can't crop for four value so what I'm

270
00:11:03,778 --> 00:11:08,490
wondering is you know I've always just

271
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,940
said hey if you have a cultivar I don't

272
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:13,620
care how hot it is if it's just really

273
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:16,410
susceptible to a particular pest just

274
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:18,179
get rid of it but have you seen anyone

275
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:20,879
successfully running something like that

276
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:22,979
is a trap plant maybe in a corner or in

277
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:24,689
the inner part of the room where they're

278
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:27,360
able to kind of monitor or is even like

279
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:28,560
maybe a scouting plant like hey we know

280
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,580
we if we know if we're gonna get drips

281
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:31,649
in the room it's gonna go to this

282
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:34,440
particular cultivar

283
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:36,690
oh you mean using it actual strain of

284
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:39,810
the crop that they're growing as a trap

285
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:41,459
plant yeah are there other plants yeah

286
00:11:39,809 --> 00:11:43,199
are there other plants that would might

287
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:44,879
suggest someone might be able to run is

288
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,860
a trap plant or at that point are you

289
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:50,519
just creating a breeding ground for this

290
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:54,480
particular pest if you that's a razor's

291
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:57,809
edge right there and I have successfully

292
00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:02,930
and unsuccessfully done trap planting in

293
00:11:57,809 --> 00:12:05,849
the past trap planting is very good for

294
00:12:02,929 --> 00:12:09,469
and I'm gonna call it Scout planting

295
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:12,839
indicator planting when I used that in

296
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:14,820
Oregon we had a very large range of

297
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:16,649
azaleas that was about a hundred and

298
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:18,060
forty four thousand square feet that was

299
00:12:16,649 --> 00:12:21,028
the size of the crave oh that they were

300
00:12:18,059 --> 00:12:23,939
in and it was I would say to 60% of the

301
00:12:21,028 --> 00:12:26,789
floor space was just pot tight as a leas

302
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:29,130
and there's really no sigh mean you can

303
00:12:26,789 --> 00:12:31,528
scout physically and I did every week

304
00:12:29,129 --> 00:12:34,169
when I went through there but also a

305
00:12:31,528 --> 00:12:37,078
good way to scout an easy way is to

306
00:12:34,169 --> 00:12:39,120
throw bush beans in there bush beans are

307
00:12:37,078 --> 00:12:42,479
huge broad leaves much bigger than your

308
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:44,100
azalea leaves if there's spider mites in

309
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,810
those plants they're going to go under

310
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,129
those bush beans they're going to leave

311
00:12:45,809 --> 00:12:48,239
they're going to leave the azalea's

312
00:12:47,129 --> 00:12:50,519
they're gonna go onto the bush beans

313
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,860
bush beans show spider mite damage

314
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:55,078
almost immediately so you can have one

315
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:57,810
or two spider mites feeding on a bush

316
00:12:55,078 --> 00:13:00,419
bean leaf causing visible damage whereas

317
00:12:57,809 --> 00:13:02,489
you would need 20 or 30 of them on a

318
00:13:00,419 --> 00:13:04,919
cannabis leaf to produce the same amount

319
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:06,690
of visible damage so if you're riding

320
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:10,019
through in a golf cart now again I'm

321
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:12,950
we're talking about a huge crevo I have

322
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:16,370
encountered very few indoor

323
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:18,650
crows that are that large that I feel

324
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:21,320
like they would need at a quick glance

325
00:13:18,649 --> 00:13:23,870
to look over and say hey does that plant

326
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:25,490
have spider mites and then the why I say

327
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:28,220
it's a razor's edge and how you can fail

328
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:31,639
miserably at it is what you have to

329
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:33,740
realize is they like that bean plant for

330
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:36,590
a reason it's not just that it shows the

331
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:40,009
damage faster it's giving them I mean

332
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:42,200
most spider mites in in commercial

333
00:13:40,009 --> 00:13:45,139
biocontrol production are produced on

334
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:48,379
some bean or another leaf in the

335
00:13:45,139 --> 00:13:50,240
greenhouses so you quickly have a spider

336
00:13:48,379 --> 00:13:53,179
mite banker plant if you don't get that

337
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:55,370
plant and cycle it out so then you're

338
00:13:53,179 --> 00:13:58,489
also creating more work you have to keep

339
00:13:55,370 --> 00:14:03,830
planting new plants to bring in most

340
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:05,990
indoor to me I've not met one that I

341
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:08,090
really felt like they couldn't dedicate

342
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:10,759
the time scouting necessary of it

343
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:13,100
physically going in and scouting as far

344
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:15,169
as a plant to pull the bad bugs off of

345
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:17,810
another plant again it's something that

346
00:14:15,169 --> 00:14:21,319
I think is has it's placing large green

347
00:14:17,809 --> 00:14:23,149
house and agriculture not so much an

348
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:25,250
indoor personally that's my personal

349
00:14:23,149 --> 00:14:27,559
thoughts on that it's it's I know the

350
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:29,210
work associated with it too it's more

351
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:30,649
than just bringing in this plant and

352
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:32,660
it's going to take care of your problems

353
00:14:30,649 --> 00:14:35,240
like you said now you have to dedicate

354
00:14:32,659 --> 00:14:37,490
to a plant that you're not going to make

355
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:40,519
money off of you will if you think of it

356
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:42,649
as abstract mathematics of is this

357
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:44,840
saving me on my scouting time is this

358
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:47,389
saving me on my spray or even my bug

359
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:48,820
budget then yeah that plants worth a lot

360
00:14:47,389 --> 00:14:51,500
of money and you should take care of it

361
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:53,090
sometimes it doesn't translate over and

362
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,919
a the first plant that's going to get

363
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:56,269
forgotten about is going to be that one

364
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:57,469
and that's the one that's gonna cause

365
00:14:56,269 --> 00:14:59,199
them the most problems when it's

366
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:01,759
forgotten

367
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:04,100
now what if let's take this to an

368
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:06,649
outdoor grow situation where you're just

369
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:09,290
growing in under the Sun no greenhouse

370
00:15:06,649 --> 00:15:10,519
no light DEP let's say you're and you

371
00:15:09,289 --> 00:15:13,449
know Humboldt or somewhere like that

372
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:16,939
would you want to plant in your garden

373
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:18,410
some potential indicator or trap plants

374
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:20,960
whatever you wanna call them as a way of

375
00:15:18,409 --> 00:15:22,519
kind of monitoring you know some of

376
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:24,610
these plants can get huge I assume

377
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:27,129
you're not scouted or a pond a ladder

378
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:29,500
vii get high or even taller in some

379
00:15:27,129 --> 00:15:31,149
cases what do you think of that and

380
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,828
that's where that's where this stuff

381
00:15:31,149 --> 00:15:35,230
shines and that's really where I think

382
00:15:32,828 --> 00:15:37,809
that it belongs personally or like in

383
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:39,190
large greenhouses and stuff but I mean

384
00:15:37,809 --> 00:15:41,229
when you see it when you see it done

385
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:43,420
successfully outdoors we work with a lot

386
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:45,610
of Southern Oregon outdoor growers that

387
00:15:43,419 --> 00:15:47,469
are there doing this that you know they

388
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:49,620
just learned this from there from

389
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:51,670
growing up gardening and and and

390
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:54,100
conventional farming has been on this

391
00:15:51,669 --> 00:15:57,429
for a long time with the sustainable

392
00:15:54,100 --> 00:16:00,009
approach of you know planting insectary

393
00:15:57,429 --> 00:16:01,870
rows in large crops we have growers that

394
00:16:00,009 --> 00:16:04,299
are doing beetle banks we have growers

395
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:06,759
that like you said some of these they

396
00:16:04,299 --> 00:16:09,278
have these amazing these plants are 16

397
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:11,230
17 feet tall and yeah you're not going

398
00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:13,059
to get up and be able to scout that

399
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:14,829
plants early maybe you can scout that

400
00:16:13,059 --> 00:16:18,099
plant but you're not going to scout your

401
00:16:14,828 --> 00:16:21,129
whole crop so trap plants indicator

402
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:25,659
plants what people call insect tree or

403
00:16:21,129 --> 00:16:28,208
feeder or companion plantings you know

404
00:16:25,659 --> 00:16:30,939
alyssum and a lot of people plant dill

405
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:32,739
and milkweed and stuff that I mean

406
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:34,750
you've got so many natural predators

407
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:36,639
semi naturally occurring predators and

408
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:38,259
mainly parasitoids you know there's so

409
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,230
many little parasitic wasps out there

410
00:16:38,259 --> 00:16:44,500
that nobody's nobody knows their name

411
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:46,539
except entomologist that you're not

412
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:48,610
going to be bringing those in and in an

413
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:50,379
indoor environment so to me it's not

414
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:53,050
worth all that effort unless you're also

415
00:16:50,379 --> 00:16:57,370
getting that extra push from Mother

416
00:16:53,049 --> 00:17:00,189
Nature yeah we have a beneficial bug mix

417
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:03,070
that we have made locally for us that we

418
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:04,660
plant along the outside of our

419
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:07,029
greenhouse and has things like a lissome

420
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:09,100
and dill in there and so I run that

421
00:17:07,029 --> 00:17:11,439
right on the outside of the greenhouse

422
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:13,088
and with the hope that these bugs are

423
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:14,740
because we raised the sides of the

424
00:17:13,088 --> 00:17:16,869
greenhouse we're not it's not a closed

425
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:20,259
greenhouse is a way of kind of an

426
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:22,568
attractant without taking away space

427
00:17:20,259 --> 00:17:24,789
from inside my greenhouse for that I

428
00:17:22,568 --> 00:17:26,709
want to use for you know growing growing

429
00:17:24,789 --> 00:17:29,440
vegetables in this case but it could be

430
00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:31,000
it could just as easily be cannabis yeah

431
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,620
and depending on what ending on where

432
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,429
you are you know one of the last work

433
00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:37,750
trips that we made before the the

434
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:40,060
makovan shutdown

435
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:41,650
one of our new reps Eric and I we were

436
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:44,039
in Southern Oregon we're visiting these

437
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:45,970
growers and they don't have any

438
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:48,700
companion plantings they have nothing

439
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:50,829
but cannabis and in several greenhouses

440
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:52,539
but it had been getting that had a

441
00:17:50,829 --> 00:17:54,759
little Indian summer so they're keeping

442
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:56,649
the sides up and we got there and

443
00:17:54,759 --> 00:17:59,259
they're freaked out asking us what these

444
00:17:56,650 --> 00:18:01,269
bud worms are that they have and we

445
00:17:59,259 --> 00:18:03,190
start scouting and they were surfing

446
00:18:01,269 --> 00:18:05,589
flies they were hovered fly larvae they

447
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:07,240
were good bugs they were eating the

448
00:18:05,589 --> 00:18:10,059
aphids that they had and this these

449
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:12,250
these guys had nothing to draw them in

450
00:18:10,059 --> 00:18:17,169
except Athens so sometimes that's all it

451
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:19,890
takes just opening your windows yeah I

452
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:23,970
think it's it's interesting from a

453
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:26,650
insect perspective the differences in

454
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:28,690
approaches when we talk about something

455
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:30,970
that's open outdoors and something

456
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:33,670
that's a closed environment agriculture

457
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:36,220
because you do get so much more

458
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:37,600
diversity in natural predators just in

459
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:39,940
an outdoor environment that you're not

460
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:42,849
getting indoors so I think it requires a

461
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:43,900
different IPM approach I mean would you

462
00:18:42,849 --> 00:18:44,529
agree with that or do you have any

463
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:49,840
thoughts on that

464
00:18:44,529 --> 00:18:52,089
oh for sure and in the long run as as we

465
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:54,490
you know I like to say we're all going

466
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:57,909
to be learning the cannabis industry for

467
00:18:54,490 --> 00:19:00,930
the next 50 years how it all pans out as

468
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:03,970
you see more uniformity come into a

469
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:05,740
indoor growing where I like to say as

470
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:07,210
soon as I know in my head what it's

471
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:09,329
going to look like when I hear you say

472
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:12,370
indoor grow because it's still kind of a

473
00:19:09,329 --> 00:19:14,619
roulette wheel as to the growing style

474
00:19:12,369 --> 00:19:17,109
but we definitely see some styles of

475
00:19:14,619 --> 00:19:19,629
growing and production pushing and

476
00:19:17,109 --> 00:19:23,799
becoming gaining popularity once you see

477
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:25,960
a more systematic traditional I'll say

478
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:28,089
growth approach I think that we're gonna

479
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:30,850
have to have it as almost to different

480
00:19:28,089 --> 00:19:34,480
schools you will have indoor IPM outdoor

481
00:19:30,849 --> 00:19:36,429
and greenhouse IPM because it is it's I

482
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,319
mean there's a lot of similarities but

483
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:39,640
there's a lot of differences and that

484
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:41,259
was one of the key challenges when I

485
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:43,090
first started this job and started

486
00:19:41,259 --> 00:19:45,129
working in cannabis is I didn't have a

487
00:19:43,089 --> 00:19:47,669
lot of indoor grow I didn't know indoor

488
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:50,470
growing experience I had visited indoor

489
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:51,330
you know hydroponic lettuce facilities

490
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:54,990
and

491
00:19:51,329 --> 00:19:56,579
the cannabis spots that if it's a

492
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:58,339
different animal and that's a lot of

493
00:19:56,579 --> 00:20:02,369
times the challenge that I see with

494
00:19:58,339 --> 00:20:04,319
indoor grower or indoor operations that

495
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:06,389
they'll lose a grower and replace them

496
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:08,309
with someone with a lot of outdoor or

497
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:10,500
somebody even like me with a bunch of

498
00:20:08,309 --> 00:20:12,960
greenhouse traditional conventional

499
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,579
greenhouse experience and just like some

500
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,579
things don't scale out sometimes they

501
00:20:14,579 --> 00:20:19,730
don't scale down to this almost

502
00:20:16,579 --> 00:20:23,099
laboratory that you're growing in so

503
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:24,240
yeah it's that's that's really

504
00:20:23,099 --> 00:20:26,699
interesting because I've always thought

505
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:29,759
of it the other way around as in hiring

506
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:32,160
that guy that ran you know ten lights in

507
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:35,789
this basement to scale up to something

508
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:38,610
that's you know like our feet that that

509
00:20:35,789 --> 00:20:40,049
scale scaling that direction is really

510
00:20:38,609 --> 00:20:41,189
challenging you know you get the right

511
00:20:40,049 --> 00:20:42,869
person they can they might be able to

512
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:44,730
pull it off but I hear more horror

513
00:20:42,869 --> 00:20:46,919
stories than anything on that I would I

514
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:48,779
would say you have failure on both sides

515
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:52,050
for different reasons I would think that

516
00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:54,240
the guy that has three lights in a

517
00:20:52,049 --> 00:20:56,730
basement in Auckland that suddenly finds

518
00:20:54,240 --> 00:21:00,150
himself as head grower of a 10 acre

519
00:20:56,730 --> 00:21:02,190
greenhouse in Salinas he fails for

520
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:03,630
obvious reasons he wasn't qualified he

521
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:05,730
has he doesn't understand crop

522
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:07,680
production on that level the other side

523
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:10,620
that you'll see is a lot of times when

524
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:13,320
you do commercial production on a grand

525
00:21:10,619 --> 00:21:15,389
scale these guys scale down to work in

526
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:17,339
an indoor they're still learning

527
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:19,110
involved I mean there's there's no I'm

528
00:21:17,339 --> 00:21:22,529
just gonna walk in because of all of my

529
00:21:19,109 --> 00:21:24,029
20-plus years in a greenhouse these guys

530
00:21:22,529 --> 00:21:26,269
weren't working with the same kind of

531
00:21:24,029 --> 00:21:29,339
equipment it wasn't the same kind of

532
00:21:26,269 --> 00:21:31,379
control the control of the environment

533
00:21:29,339 --> 00:21:32,909
so it is it's a learning curve and

534
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:34,410
sometimes guys don't want to do it they

535
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:35,820
don't want to learn a different way and

536
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:40,800
they realize how different indoor

537
00:21:35,819 --> 00:21:42,599
growing actually is me I've always say

538
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:44,430
if I have another life I'm gonna do it

539
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:46,949
just because I didn't and I would love

540
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:48,539
to learn all the differences in it it's

541
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:50,549
not entirely different it's nothing I'd

542
00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:52,500
be afraid to do I just I always say I

543
00:21:50,549 --> 00:21:54,029
would not accept a head grower position

544
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:56,430
I would accept an assistant grower

545
00:21:54,029 --> 00:21:59,069
physician and then maybe next year I'll

546
00:21:56,430 --> 00:22:01,529
go for head grower I like that I like

547
00:21:59,069 --> 00:22:04,649
that so one question I wanted to touch

548
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:07,519
back on was you had mentioned working

549
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:10,320
some outdoor growers what sorts of

550
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:13,619
insects would you purchase as an outdoor

551
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:16,829
grower now I just did a podcast talking

552
00:22:13,619 --> 00:22:18,479
about with JP Michelle talking about how

553
00:22:16,829 --> 00:22:20,119
you don't want to buy ladybugs I know

554
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,470
you mentioned ladybugs at the beginning

555
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:25,469
when you were first getting into it so

556
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:27,450
we know ladybugs are out what other

557
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:28,769
things just don't translate to an

558
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:30,779
outdoor environment so if you have an

559
00:22:28,769 --> 00:22:32,220
outdoor grow it's just like don't don't

560
00:22:30,779 --> 00:22:33,899
waste your money on these insects

561
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:36,059
they're just gonna fly away or you're

562
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:39,690
not gonna get as good of control or you

563
00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:42,329
may not yeah I would think it's if

564
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:45,360
anything maybe you may not need them the

565
00:22:42,329 --> 00:22:47,339
thing is that I like to remind people is

566
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:50,759
everything that we sell occurs naturally

567
00:22:47,339 --> 00:22:53,369
outdoors so in the right setting they

568
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:56,819
all work outdoors and the the thought of

569
00:22:53,369 --> 00:22:59,159
them flying away and actually it's great

570
00:22:56,819 --> 00:23:01,769
one of the new guys some newer guys on

571
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:03,060
our team explained this to me because he

572
00:23:01,769 --> 00:23:06,240
has a really strong entomology

573
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:08,369
background as of a little explanation of

574
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,569
why lady birds just seemed to because

575
00:23:08,369 --> 00:23:11,789
when you release them you love it

576
00:23:09,569 --> 00:23:13,529
they're attacking aphids and then really

577
00:23:11,789 --> 00:23:15,450
good you go home and you come back and

578
00:23:13,529 --> 00:23:17,910
they got half of the job done and then

579
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:19,470
they left or they or they just flew down

580
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:22,940
and got lost

581
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:27,569
ladybirds have an instinct to look for

582
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:29,670
huge abundance food sources so when they

583
00:23:27,569 --> 00:23:32,159
feed 10 aphids that's not an abundance

584
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:35,009
they want 50 aphids so that was a good

585
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:37,740
good way to clear that up for me

586
00:23:35,009 --> 00:23:40,430
now again ladybird show up on their own

587
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:42,900
I don't want you out there killing them

588
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:44,580
now having said all of that and like

589
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:47,490
some things are just a little more

590
00:23:44,579 --> 00:23:49,769
challenging to apply outdoors if you

591
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:53,099
don't have a way to mass distribute like

592
00:23:49,769 --> 00:23:54,930
the bulk predatory mites like a blower

593
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:56,519
or a spreader or something and you're

594
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:57,990
dealing with several acres it can be

595
00:23:56,519 --> 00:24:00,240
very daunting to be walking around

596
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:01,819
shaking a bottle of mites on each and

597
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:05,579
then that's when you want growers to

598
00:24:01,819 --> 00:24:06,929
actually focus on things that fly things

599
00:24:05,579 --> 00:24:08,730
that don't have to be released into

600
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:10,500
every plant and then as far as the every

601
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:12,269
plant releases you get your predatory

602
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:14,400
mites in there with slow release sachets

603
00:24:12,269 --> 00:24:16,500
so you're getting men you're only having

604
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,659
to do it once every four weeks instead

605
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:21,058
of weakly shaking

606
00:24:18,659 --> 00:24:23,278
mites on to you know three four we work

607
00:24:21,058 --> 00:24:27,200
with now with hemp opening up some of

608
00:24:23,278 --> 00:24:29,878
these are hundreds of acres in size I

609
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:33,659
don't really feel like many of our bugs

610
00:24:29,878 --> 00:24:36,058
are useless outdoors it just depends on

611
00:24:33,659 --> 00:24:39,119
what pest you're dealing with nematode

612
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:41,098
drenches in a in in the soil can get

613
00:24:39,118 --> 00:24:44,428
extremely expensive when you get into

614
00:24:41,098 --> 00:24:45,839
large farms so that might be something

615
00:24:44,429 --> 00:24:47,190
that a grower would consider but a lot

616
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:49,199
of times you're not running into fungus

617
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:51,808
gnat issues in an outdoor farm like you

618
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,700
are in an indoor greenhouse operation

619
00:24:51,808 --> 00:24:56,158
yeah I was I was kind of wondering about

620
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:59,220
that because I've never in my outdoor

621
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:01,019
experience which is fairly limited to be

622
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:03,269
fair I've never had issues with fungus

623
00:25:01,019 --> 00:25:05,759
gnats they seem to be a pretty well

624
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:07,558
controlled by the environment even even

625
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:10,200
if your outdoor experience is limited

626
00:25:07,558 --> 00:25:12,239
tad it's it's experienced in probably

627
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,598
the most fungus gnat prone area in the

628
00:25:12,239 --> 00:25:15,479
country

629
00:25:12,598 --> 00:25:18,558
so it's incredibly wet and gloomy there

630
00:25:15,479 --> 00:25:21,479
so that's another one that that was a

631
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:23,278
nice little kind of eye-opener for me

632
00:25:21,479 --> 00:25:26,639
about moving to the northwest because

633
00:25:23,278 --> 00:25:29,278
you know rains a lot in Florida too but

634
00:25:26,638 --> 00:25:31,888
not during the winter so fungus gnats

635
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:34,440
out there are up there I should say now

636
00:25:31,888 --> 00:25:36,598
Excel live in California but up there

637
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:38,669
are there a whole different animal as

638
00:25:36,598 --> 00:25:40,319
well but they're not really I mean

639
00:25:38,669 --> 00:25:42,809
fungus gnats are mainly going to be the

640
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:44,579
biggest concern to me in nursery

641
00:25:42,808 --> 00:25:46,108
environments where you've got plants

642
00:25:44,579 --> 00:25:47,398
pushing out new roots because that's

643
00:25:46,108 --> 00:25:50,189
where they want to be they want to be

644
00:25:47,398 --> 00:25:52,498
eating those root tips you know the 16

645
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:54,509
foot tall plant that's three week you

646
00:25:52,499 --> 00:25:56,759
know two weeks away from harvest it's

647
00:25:54,509 --> 00:25:59,940
not really going crazy down in the

648
00:25:56,759 --> 00:26:03,690
rhizosphere at that time sure that makes

649
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:06,950
sense though I think fungus gnats are

650
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:09,629
also one of the easier things to control

651
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:12,179
physically with sticky traps and then

652
00:26:09,628 --> 00:26:16,039
using you know nematodes or nematodes

653
00:26:12,179 --> 00:26:18,048
and other other methods for

654
00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:20,029
for controlling them I mean what what's

655
00:26:18,048 --> 00:26:22,429
your experience if we're talking fungus

656
00:26:20,029 --> 00:26:24,410
gnats real quickly um one thing to keep

657
00:26:22,429 --> 00:26:25,610
in mind stickies for fungus gnats are

658
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:28,970
just going to tell you that you have

659
00:26:25,609 --> 00:26:31,459
fungus gnats there's not much there's

660
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:34,009
not much control achieved by going after

661
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:35,990
the adults unfortunately it's kind of

662
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:38,750
like getting rude aphids that are out of

663
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:40,910
the soil but it is good for again as an

664
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:44,630
indicator to know if you have them or

665
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:46,779
not but to me I think Suzanne is the one

666
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:49,610
that probably coined the phrase that

667
00:26:46,779 --> 00:26:52,279
nematodes are the the gateway drug for

668
00:26:49,609 --> 00:26:54,048
bio control because even like I said

669
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:55,519
that was the first thing I saw efficacy

670
00:26:54,048 --> 00:26:58,369
with with Steiner name of fealty and

671
00:26:55,519 --> 00:27:00,230
nematodes drenched into plug trace on

672
00:26:58,369 --> 00:27:02,509
you know new cuttings that had been

673
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:04,130
stuck that we're developing roots I had

674
00:27:02,509 --> 00:27:07,480
worked better than chemicals and it was

675
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:11,360
cheaper so that one was a no-brainer you

676
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:14,630
know for larger areas and once we were

677
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:16,759
going propagating plants in like four or

678
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:19,790
five six inch pots and bigger you know

679
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:22,490
bigger than plug you know a 52 or 104

680
00:27:19,789 --> 00:27:24,259
cell trace we have a bigger soil volume

681
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:28,609
we were also starting introduce

682
00:27:24,259 --> 00:27:31,519
Australia lay laps then not as often in

683
00:27:28,609 --> 00:27:33,048
plug prairies but you know strata early

684
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:35,298
laps for people that might not know

685
00:27:33,048 --> 00:27:37,490
their predatory might they live in the

686
00:27:35,298 --> 00:27:38,509
soil they're introduced at planting at

687
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:40,880
transplant

688
00:27:38,509 --> 00:27:42,919
they feed on a lot of the same things

689
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:46,309
that the Steiner name of fealty a target

690
00:27:42,919 --> 00:27:48,679
they work well together as well in some

691
00:27:46,308 --> 00:27:52,460
high pressure areas like when we would

692
00:27:48,679 --> 00:27:54,410
propagate in a six inch 7 inch pot for a

693
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:55,819
couple of weeks after we did the

694
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:57,590
strategies we're still going to be doing

695
00:27:55,819 --> 00:28:01,700
nematodes in there just because that

696
00:27:57,589 --> 00:28:04,099
plants vulnerable at that time and you

697
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:07,340
know them crop you see steadily laughs

698
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:10,009
that's the former hypo aspis miles or

699
00:28:07,339 --> 00:28:12,199
right correct make sure for people who

700
00:28:10,009 --> 00:28:15,319
may be familiar with the old name like

701
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:17,509
Iowa yes and and sometimes and sometimes

702
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:19,490
I joke that if you really want a lot of

703
00:28:17,509 --> 00:28:21,890
good info on strata early laps you have

704
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:24,259
to Google hypo Estes because there's

705
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:26,299
more research out there under the old

706
00:28:24,259 --> 00:28:28,220
taxonomy and the same thing happened

707
00:28:26,298 --> 00:28:29,058
right around the same time with the

708
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,630
DeLucie

709
00:28:29,058 --> 00:28:32,569
the

710
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:35,300
Corie area which is a predatory beetle

711
00:28:32,569 --> 00:28:37,490
Rove beetle that we sell it was a feat

712
00:28:35,299 --> 00:28:39,680
of quarry Aria before that some

713
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:43,609
companies still sell them as a theta and

714
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:46,970
hypo aspis we updated the we updated it

715
00:28:43,609 --> 00:28:50,179
but um yeah again a lot of times if you

716
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:51,500
want info on DeLucie people will say you

717
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:53,420
know what do I look up I'm like well

718
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:55,519
first off look up a theta not de Lucia

719
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:56,950
because they studied a theta for years

720
00:28:55,519 --> 00:29:00,589
and years

721
00:28:56,950 --> 00:29:03,440
yeah so one question I have I've always

722
00:29:00,589 --> 00:29:05,539
thought that with fungus gnats like mass

723
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:08,660
trapping if you have a really bad

724
00:29:05,539 --> 00:29:10,549
infestation because I've seen once I've

725
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:12,560
had ones frankly when I first started

726
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:15,409
going that got out of control

727
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:17,210
I thought catching the adults that were

728
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:19,730
coming back down and potentially laying

729
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:21,710
the eggs for new larvae was a good idea

730
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:24,230
or is there do you find that it just

731
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:27,110
doesn't make a difference at that

732
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:29,839
I wouldn't say again it's not I mean

733
00:29:27,109 --> 00:29:31,429
it's like killing the root aphids above

734
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:33,349
soil you're not definitely not hurting

735
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:36,080
anything you are stopping an aphid that

736
00:29:33,349 --> 00:29:38,689
could relocate and then again reproduce

737
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:41,089
and it's nothing that I would tell

738
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:43,220
growers not to do breaking a life cycle

739
00:29:41,089 --> 00:29:44,720
again that's why I had that's why I used

740
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:47,390
three different things against thrips

741
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:49,610
was to interrupt that life cycle the

742
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:52,160
only reason that I would say don't maybe

743
00:29:49,609 --> 00:29:55,879
don't worry about it is if you if you

744
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:57,290
follow basically the cookbook of hit him

745
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:59,150
with the strata hit him with the

746
00:29:57,289 --> 00:30:00,920
nematodes hit him with the strata is in

747
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:04,580
my opinion is you're not going to need

748
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:06,590
to invest in the amount of sticky cards

749
00:30:04,579 --> 00:30:08,629
that it takes to successfully trap that

750
00:30:06,589 --> 00:30:11,509
many because you're talking probably at

751
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:13,910
least one per plant maybe more so just

752
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:16,309
from a production destruction standpoint

753
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:17,779
but certainly I'm not going to beat

754
00:30:16,309 --> 00:30:19,639
anybody up for it if I saw somebody

755
00:30:17,779 --> 00:30:21,559
trapping them I'm just gonna say I hope

756
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:23,810
you're doing more than just trapping and

757
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:26,409
my thoughts are if you really

758
00:30:23,809 --> 00:30:29,899
aggressively go after fungus gnats I

759
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:31,550
mean yes there's a reason that she calls

760
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:33,259
them the gateway drug because once you

761
00:30:31,549 --> 00:30:38,000
see how easy those work you're like out

762
00:30:33,259 --> 00:30:41,119
man I got this I can do this so but

763
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,829
again if I walk into a grow room or a

764
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:43,489
greenhouse and a growers got really bad

765
00:30:42,829 --> 00:30:45,319
Tsongas now

766
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:47,990
that are concerning them and that is and

767
00:30:45,319 --> 00:30:49,669
they feel that that's helping them by

768
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:52,130
all means but I want to make sure you're

769
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:53,509
going into that soil because those are

770
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:55,220
the ones that are the problem those are

771
00:30:53,509 --> 00:30:58,039
the ones that are actively destroying

772
00:30:55,220 --> 00:31:00,110
your plant by the time you get nematodes

773
00:30:58,039 --> 00:31:02,389
in there you get your strata is in there

774
00:31:00,109 --> 00:31:06,049
those adult fungus gnats are gonna come

775
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:09,860
back to a boil that is not conducive for

776
00:31:06,049 --> 00:31:11,629
is is not welcoming for them that makes

777
00:31:09,859 --> 00:31:15,169
sense that makes sense so you're not

778
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:17,990
you're not anti sticky traps you just

779
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:20,210
see them not at all as I wish more

780
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:22,519
growers use sticky traps so if I saw a

781
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:24,710
grower using more than usual I'm

782
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:26,359
certainly not going to get mad at them I

783
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:29,120
work with big greenhouses that they

784
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:30,829
don't have any and to me that's much

785
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:33,199
more of a concern than a grower who

786
00:31:30,829 --> 00:31:35,899
might be using too many it's again it's

787
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,789
just from just just solely if I were to

788
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:40,690
walk into one of my greenhouses and see

789
00:31:37,789 --> 00:31:43,039
a sectional grower doing it I'd say um

790
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:46,100
you know those things aren't free or

791
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:48,319
something snarky like that just that if

792
00:31:46,099 --> 00:31:49,909
it's within the budget and and if

793
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:50,839
sometimes I also say like man if it

794
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:53,360
makes you sleep better you're not

795
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:54,558
hurting anything that's for sure well

796
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:56,779
let's reiterate let's talk a little

797
00:31:54,558 --> 00:32:00,220
about sticky traps since since we're on

798
00:31:56,779 --> 00:32:03,558
the subject in terms of orientation in

799
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:06,380
greenhouse in relation to canopy or

800
00:32:03,558 --> 00:32:08,480
lighting and then also in a indoor

801
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:11,030
facility where you have fixed overhead

802
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:13,069
lighting where do you put those sticky

803
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:14,899
traps and then how frequently should you

804
00:32:13,069 --> 00:32:16,730
be changing those out I know that's

805
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:18,440
another thing that a lot of growers

806
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:20,390
forget to do is they just put up the

807
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:22,519
trap and then they're not checking to

808
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:24,800
see how quickly populations are

809
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:26,690
increasing on that trap right and that's

810
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:29,450
the whole purpose of I mean there is

811
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:31,910
some we've to put stickies near our

812
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:33,740
intake fans we weren't trying to capture

813
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:35,779
anything we were just trying to see what

814
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:37,339
was coming in so that was kind of like

815
00:32:35,779 --> 00:32:39,889
we'd put it up there it might not check

816
00:32:37,339 --> 00:32:41,480
it for ten days but then we check it and

817
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:42,980
it's like oh man there's cucumber beetle

818
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:44,599
on here so that's coming in from outside

819
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:47,569
so we know that that's in our crop

820
00:32:44,599 --> 00:32:50,240
probably but as far as the one in the

821
00:32:47,569 --> 00:32:52,849
crop the whole point is to go back and

822
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:56,930
check it and to log what you found now

823
00:32:52,849 --> 00:32:58,849
it depends in a high high pest pressure

824
00:32:56,930 --> 00:33:00,830
like if I put a sticky card out I mean

825
00:32:58,849 --> 00:33:03,709
you got to within a week you need to be

826
00:33:00,829 --> 00:33:05,689
back checking it one way or another if

827
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:08,299
you're in a high-pressure and you need

828
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:09,799
to then you need to make a plan within

829
00:33:08,299 --> 00:33:13,639
the next week you need to put a sticky

830
00:33:09,799 --> 00:33:15,950
out and check it three days later now if

831
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:18,800
you check it it's covered in thrips you

832
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:20,420
need to replace it if you are doing your

833
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:22,099
due diligence and your regularly

834
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:24,769
monitoring like for instance in my

835
00:33:22,099 --> 00:33:26,269
poinsettia crop what I would do I'd put

836
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:29,690
my stickies out I'd check them every

837
00:33:26,269 --> 00:33:30,279
Monday this sticky might have five

838
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:34,009
thrips

839
00:33:30,279 --> 00:33:36,829
to whitefly and you know three or four

840
00:33:34,009 --> 00:33:39,319
little random midges that it picked up

841
00:33:36,829 --> 00:33:41,569
so what you do is you take a sharpie and

842
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:43,579
you circle them or you just put a dot

843
00:33:41,569 --> 00:33:45,019
next to them in some way you indicate

844
00:33:43,579 --> 00:33:46,939
them and then you write the date on

845
00:33:45,019 --> 00:33:48,769
there and then you put the card back out

846
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:50,720
then that way when you check it a week

847
00:33:48,769 --> 00:33:53,119
later and you see the ones with the dots

848
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:54,470
on them you know not to count those so

849
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:57,799
that's one way that you can make us

850
00:33:54,470 --> 00:34:00,140
piggy lasts more than a week if if needs

851
00:33:57,799 --> 00:34:01,819
be but if you put a sticky out and you

852
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:03,830
just don't come back for two three

853
00:34:01,819 --> 00:34:07,069
months that doesn't tell you anything it

854
00:34:03,829 --> 00:34:09,469
may attract some bugs but it didn't it's

855
00:34:07,069 --> 00:34:12,019
not serving its purpose the purpose of a

856
00:34:09,469 --> 00:34:13,519
sticky card it's to come back monitor it

857
00:34:12,019 --> 00:34:15,710
that's how you determine your pest

858
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:16,969
populations that along with other

859
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:20,119
scouting methods

860
00:34:16,969 --> 00:34:22,639
I like that I've never heard of that tip

861
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:25,400
that's that's a really cool idea yeah

862
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:26,839
it's a lot it's one way it's just one

863
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:28,519
way and you know because a lot of times

864
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:30,050
they sell these stickies in all

865
00:34:28,519 --> 00:34:31,489
different sizes and some of them are

866
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:33,650
almost as big as a sheet of notebook

867
00:34:31,489 --> 00:34:35,929
paper so you're talking pretty expensive

868
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:38,630
if you toss one of those out once a week

869
00:34:35,929 --> 00:34:40,099
if you're in a citrus grove or something

870
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:41,809
where they're going to be using these so

871
00:34:40,099 --> 00:34:45,049
that's actually where I saw that

872
00:34:41,809 --> 00:34:46,820
initially was in Florida citrus that the

873
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:48,590
growers would go and they'd monitor it

874
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:50,090
and they'd pull a sharpie out and circle

875
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:51,559
it and write the date and then they

876
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:53,150
dried off and I said you're not going to

877
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:55,250
replace that and they're like no those

878
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:57,619
are like three dollars a piece and we

879
00:34:55,250 --> 00:35:03,199
have you know how many thousand I'm out

880
00:34:57,619 --> 00:35:05,480
here so but as far as orientation in the

881
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:08,230
crop a lot of it is going to have to do

882
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:10,849
with what pests you're monitoring for

883
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:12,170
and if you have really tall plants

884
00:35:10,849 --> 00:35:14,329
and you think that trips are an issue

885
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:16,430
you're gonna need a sticky somewhere up

886
00:35:14,329 --> 00:35:18,139
in that canopy but if you also are

887
00:35:16,429 --> 00:35:21,349
monitoring for fungus gnats you're gonna

888
00:35:18,139 --> 00:35:23,379
or possibly potentially root aphid very

889
00:35:21,349 --> 00:35:25,610
rarely get on the sticky traps that

890
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:27,920
sometimes the winged ones will get lost

891
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:29,809
and and end up there then you're gonna

892
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,119
want one down in the in the base of the

893
00:35:29,809 --> 00:35:33,949
plant one of the big mistakes I see is

894
00:35:32,119 --> 00:35:36,589
growers hanging stickies like you know

895
00:35:33,949 --> 00:35:37,939
foot above the canopy oh yeah you seem

896
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:39,980
out by the lights a lot because they

897
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:43,760
think there's a insects are attracted to

898
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:45,619
light yeah and in some insects are but

899
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:47,870
then the insects you need to worry about

900
00:35:45,619 --> 00:35:49,429
are attracted to your plants so that's

901
00:35:47,869 --> 00:35:51,469
where as a sticky card needs to be

902
00:35:49,429 --> 00:35:53,449
anything flying two feet above your

903
00:35:51,469 --> 00:35:54,949
plants will worry about those once we've

904
00:35:53,449 --> 00:35:57,859
got everything that's flying within the

905
00:35:54,949 --> 00:36:00,049
canopy handled and especially with

906
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:01,760
thrips is one that I see people put the

907
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:03,410
stickies down at the soil or they put

908
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,930
them above the plant it's like you

909
00:36:03,409 --> 00:36:08,179
missed the whole point there's got to be

910
00:36:05,929 --> 00:36:10,940
a spot SERPs aren't jumping up and

911
00:36:08,179 --> 00:36:12,230
flying great distances into the air if

912
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:15,740
you ever seen them fly they're not

913
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:17,090
really agile fliers they're just kind of

914
00:36:15,739 --> 00:36:20,509
getting from point A to point B so

915
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:22,039
they're flying within the canopy but

916
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:23,660
yeah there's no need for stickies the

917
00:36:22,039 --> 00:36:26,929
only time I ever put stickies up high

918
00:36:23,659 --> 00:36:30,230
like I said was by our intake fans which

919
00:36:26,929 --> 00:36:32,059
was just early season or the greenhouses

920
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:34,460
that I worked at we were surrounded by a

921
00:36:32,059 --> 00:36:37,489
lot of cultivated farmland that was just

922
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:40,970
rotating crops so every time they

923
00:36:37,489 --> 00:36:42,229
harvested it was like okay if we can

924
00:36:40,969 --> 00:36:45,109
we're going to close the greenhouses

925
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:47,360
completely for two days because it's

926
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:50,829
like the mass exodus of everything

927
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:52,700
coming out of those harvested crops

928
00:36:50,829 --> 00:36:55,099
obviously when they're harvesting in

929
00:36:52,699 --> 00:36:57,199
August we can't keep our greenhouses

930
00:36:55,099 --> 00:36:59,360
closed so it's like okay put some

931
00:36:57,199 --> 00:37:02,719
stickies up and let's see what's showing

932
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:04,070
up here what we're gonna get some days

933
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:05,839
you put the sticky up and you come back

934
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:09,230
the next day and it's black from thrips

935
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:12,500
that came in from them harvesting all

936
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:14,150
the onions around you mmm I never even

937
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:16,010
thought about that usually I'm thinking

938
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:17,329
about like pesticidal drift I forget

939
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:21,140
about the fact that some of these

940
00:37:17,329 --> 00:37:23,608
agricultural areas will also be crop a

941
00:37:21,139 --> 00:37:25,949
lot of insects need to go somewhere

942
00:37:23,608 --> 00:37:27,719
yeah we used to stand out and watch when

943
00:37:25,949 --> 00:37:29,998
the when they would come out and start

944
00:37:27,719 --> 00:37:31,619
harvesting we could stand at the end of

945
00:37:29,998 --> 00:37:34,679
some of our greenhouses and you would

946
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:36,869
watch the birds just like swarming down

947
00:37:34,679 --> 00:37:38,969
behind these machines and it's like yeah

948
00:37:36,869 --> 00:37:40,588
because they're eating bugs the little

949
00:37:38,969 --> 00:37:41,999
bugs that they're not eating are coming

950
00:37:40,588 --> 00:37:45,150
right over here to the only other

951
00:37:41,998 --> 00:37:47,129
healthy plants they can find which we'd

952
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:49,170
get movements of bugs that came through

953
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:50,640
that we'd only see for a week by the

954
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:51,959
time I'm like oh god what are we going

955
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:56,068
to do about these leaf hopper they're

956
00:37:51,958 --> 00:37:58,108
gone that we got some that decided to

957
00:37:56,068 --> 00:38:02,068
stay like huge surges and thrips

958
00:37:58,108 --> 00:38:03,808
sometimes so that was a that was a took

959
00:38:02,068 --> 00:38:05,818
a couple years to get on board with the

960
00:38:03,809 --> 00:38:07,890
farmers around us to kind of keep us in

961
00:38:05,818 --> 00:38:10,920
the loop about things like that so we

962
00:38:07,889 --> 00:38:13,469
could at least X be ready for it you

963
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:17,278
know yeah alright you mentioned leaf

964
00:38:13,469 --> 00:38:19,889
hoppers I hate leaf hoppers I is there

965
00:38:17,278 --> 00:38:25,139
anything you can really do to control

966
00:38:19,889 --> 00:38:27,088
leaf hoppers there as far as its things

967
00:38:25,139 --> 00:38:28,498
with legs and wings like what we

968
00:38:27,088 --> 00:38:31,498
specialize in

969
00:38:28,498 --> 00:38:34,078
I can only provide anecdotal results for

970
00:38:31,498 --> 00:38:36,088
you I can show you where certain things

971
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:38,880
that we produce will eat them given the

972
00:38:36,088 --> 00:38:41,608
opportunity there's also the very nature

973
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:43,108
of look at their name leaf hopper you

974
00:38:41,608 --> 00:38:45,449
got to have something it's going to be

975
00:38:43,108 --> 00:38:47,909
able to catch them too there's all kinds

976
00:38:45,449 --> 00:38:49,829
of bugs that will prey on them I'm sure

977
00:38:47,909 --> 00:38:53,969
that they have their parasitoids as well

978
00:38:49,829 --> 00:38:56,068
a man leaf hopper or one that we don't

979
00:38:53,969 --> 00:38:57,989
really have a realistic solution for not

980
00:38:56,068 --> 00:39:00,268
one that's worth in my opinion not one

981
00:38:57,989 --> 00:39:02,249
that's worth you spending the money you

982
00:39:00,268 --> 00:39:05,728
would have to do a mass inoculation with

983
00:39:02,248 --> 00:39:07,679
aureus or an lacewing something that's

984
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:09,358
just a real generalist predator but then

985
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:12,748
it's also got to have the opportunity to

986
00:39:09,358 --> 00:39:14,608
catch it and kill it and eat it the

987
00:39:12,748 --> 00:39:16,439
hopper is one that even sprays it's

988
00:39:14,608 --> 00:39:18,989
difficult to control the sprays even

989
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:20,969
when I when they would harvest those

990
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:23,420
fields and we would get the leaf hopper

991
00:39:20,969 --> 00:39:25,679
and mark poinsettias of all things and

992
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:28,139
poinsettias I wasn't doing a lot of

993
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:31,798
biocontrol and so I could go I could go

994
00:39:28,139 --> 00:39:33,150
heavy they're not a pollen producer we

995
00:39:31,798 --> 00:39:35,940
didn't have a lot of pushback from the

996
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:37,519
stores about you know bees with

997
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:41,220
poinsettias they're just not real

998
00:39:37,519 --> 00:39:43,889
pollen heavy crop I mean even with hard

999
00:39:41,219 --> 00:39:45,929
chemistry I could not stop them and most

1000
00:39:43,889 --> 00:39:48,299
times it was like I said by the time I

1001
00:39:45,929 --> 00:39:52,500
was ready to jump off a bridge over it

1002
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:55,650
they were gone so leaf hoppers something

1003
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:57,630
though that this past season we saw what

1004
00:39:55,650 --> 00:40:00,329
I would call an increase from all over

1005
00:39:57,630 --> 00:40:02,490
people dealing with damage from them

1006
00:40:00,329 --> 00:40:04,769
before it was we find them in there they

1007
00:40:02,489 --> 00:40:06,029
don't really worry me now it's uh hey if

1008
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:08,579
these things actually screw up our

1009
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:11,400
plants now I don't know that they're

1010
00:40:08,579 --> 00:40:13,200
doing economical damage to the plants in

1011
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:15,780
the long run that yeah

1012
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:17,549
in my opinion remains to be seen so it's

1013
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:22,109
not that I tell people don't worry about

1014
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:24,900
them but most people have plants that we

1015
00:40:22,108 --> 00:40:26,519
know for most people have pests that we

1016
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:29,720
know for a fact are going to damage

1017
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:34,349
their crop that we need to be tending to

1018
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:36,088
the leaf hopper honestly I might try to

1019
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:37,980
point in the direction of some of the

1020
00:40:36,088 --> 00:40:40,139
bio pesticide sprays or something like

1021
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:43,559
that but even then I'm gonna tell you to

1022
00:40:40,139 --> 00:40:45,449
manage your expectations yeah you know I

1023
00:40:43,559 --> 00:40:46,980
oh and I noticed them on outdoor

1024
00:40:45,449 --> 00:40:49,679
cannabis plants it was more just an

1025
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:51,599
annoyance than I then the actual amount

1026
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:54,389
of damage they never they didn't seem to

1027
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:56,430
like create damage reproduce on the

1028
00:40:54,389 --> 00:40:58,440
plant and then create more damage to

1029
00:40:56,429 --> 00:40:59,909
where I noticed it was dramatically

1030
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:02,010
banning the health of the plan I mean at

1031
00:40:59,909 --> 00:41:05,039
once I've seen it once what I would call

1032
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:06,510
an infestation of damage that and and I

1033
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:07,920
had one of the other reps with me when

1034
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:10,829
we were visiting the screen house and

1035
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:12,510
we're just like it's it's bound to

1036
00:41:10,829 --> 00:41:15,539
happen eventually I've seen white fly

1037
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:18,780
significantly damaging cannabis one time

1038
00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:20,909
I've seen white flying cannabis 20 times

1039
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:24,420
easily I've seen damage from it once

1040
00:41:20,909 --> 00:41:27,059
so most people think you're describing

1041
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:28,829
it's an annoyance it's kind of a nobody

1042
00:41:27,059 --> 00:41:31,769
likes to see these bugs in there that we

1043
00:41:28,829 --> 00:41:33,839
know are not doing the plant any good

1044
00:41:31,769 --> 00:41:36,318
but I think the question is how much

1045
00:41:33,838 --> 00:41:38,639
damage in the long run leaf miner is

1046
00:41:36,318 --> 00:41:40,889
definitely a pest of cannabis I have a

1047
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:42,269
million pictures of leaf miner leaving

1048
00:41:40,889 --> 00:41:44,400
little Bugs Bunny trails through

1049
00:41:42,269 --> 00:41:46,500
cannabis leaves they don't vector any

1050
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:48,300
they don't vector any viruses and they

1051
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:51,389
don't damage the plant enough to

1052
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:52,920
interfere with photosynthesis so really

1053
00:41:51,389 --> 00:41:54,420
and my thought is there not a pest

1054
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:58,349
that's not an ornamental plant you're

1055
00:41:54,420 --> 00:42:01,500
not selling it for the leaves so um you

1056
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:04,470
know for the nel I consider leaf miner

1057
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:06,989
kind of in that same category or not lis

1058
00:42:04,469 --> 00:42:08,759
I would just I would just shake the

1059
00:42:06,989 --> 00:42:10,949
leaves usually I would just shake the

1060
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:12,569
the branches or one time I had the

1061
00:42:10,949 --> 00:42:14,939
blower out cuz I was blow in my driveway

1062
00:42:12,568 --> 00:42:16,259
and I just went yeah from a distance

1063
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:18,000
just kind of blew them off cuz it made

1064
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:20,309
me feel better even though I know just

1065
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,559
probably hop right back on and that's

1066
00:42:20,309 --> 00:42:24,960
probably an honestly man exactly what

1067
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:28,470
you saw them do I mean you see most

1068
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:30,179
insects have a lot of a lot of insects I

1069
00:42:28,469 --> 00:42:32,699
should say have incredible reaction time

1070
00:42:30,179 --> 00:42:34,440
and a lot of times I would try to spray

1071
00:42:32,699 --> 00:42:36,449
them and you just see them flying off

1072
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:38,700
they're flying off of the plants you

1073
00:42:36,449 --> 00:42:40,379
haven't even got to yet so it's like

1074
00:42:38,699 --> 00:42:43,500
unless I'm really hitting this with

1075
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:45,028
something nasty and long residuals until

1076
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:47,940
they come back to step on it

1077
00:42:45,028 --> 00:42:51,088
like most soft chemistry's you have to

1078
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:52,829
hit the bug to kill it so even when

1079
00:42:51,088 --> 00:42:56,068
there are spray options for them like

1080
00:42:52,829 --> 00:42:58,048
they're just yeah they're there one that

1081
00:42:56,068 --> 00:43:00,630
I hope doesn't establish as a big-time

1082
00:42:58,048 --> 00:43:02,309
pest because it's one that we and the

1083
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:12,028
chemical companies are going to have

1084
00:43:02,309 --> 00:43:13,619
some homework to do on all right guys

1085
00:43:12,028 --> 00:43:15,150
I'm pausing the interview here and we'll
