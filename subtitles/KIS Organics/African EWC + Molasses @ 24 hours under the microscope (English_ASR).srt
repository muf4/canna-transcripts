1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,679
okay we're back with the

2
00:00:04,359 --> 00:00:10,800
African worm

3
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:13,320
castings at 24 hours with a little bit

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,960
of molassus added in now we're starting

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,399
to see some more activity here so we're

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:21,519
starting to get some fungal

7
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:23,759
High getting uh a strand like this uh

8
00:00:21,518 --> 00:00:26,159
probably every other field of view so I

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,599
think this this were a tea I'd want it

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,920
to go longer we're at 24 hours right now

11
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,679
um

12
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:35,760
keep in mind that your field of view is

13
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:37,960
or through this video is a lot smaller

14
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:40,159
than my actual field of view through the

15
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,160
eye

16
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:44,799
pieces so let's see if we zoom in

17
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:49,599
here lot more bacterial

18
00:00:56,679 --> 00:01:00,759
activity you can see it looks like we

19
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:03,118
have pretty good

20
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:06,798
uh morphological

21
00:01:03,118 --> 00:01:06,799
diversity different

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,560
uh shapes of

23
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,840
bacteria
