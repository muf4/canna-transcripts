00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:38,699
most well known in the industry as the

12
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:41,160
co-inventor of Mammoth p

13
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:44,700
completed his PhD in soil microbial

14
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:47,099
ecology in 2009 as a research scientist

15
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,660
at Colorado State University Colin

16
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,219
published dozens of peer-reviewed

17
00:00:48,659 --> 00:00:52,799
Publications that were focused on

18
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:55,079
elucidating microbial mediated processes

19
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:57,538
that enhance plant growth Collins

20
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:59,399
academic research includes long-term

21
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:01,500
multi-disciplinary studies in which

22
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,840
biological chemical and physical

23
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,938
characteristics of soils were measured

24
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,700
to elucidate soil microbial and plant

25
00:01:05,938 --> 00:01:11,039
responses to climate variability he

26
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,600
currently works for microbial Mass a

27
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,520
plant Amendment product comprised of

28
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:16,679
several unique species of beneficial

29
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:19,019
bacteria shown to promote plant Vigor

30
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,000
increase plant biomass and enhance

31
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:23,699
microbial life in and around the root

32
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,319
zone now on to the show

33
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,820
hey Colin thanks for coming on the show

34
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:28,798
today

35
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:31,019
dad great to see you it's been quite a

36
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:34,080
while and happy to be here yeah I'm glad

37
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:35,699
we got to reconnect and I wanted to just

38
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,560
start off why don't you tell us uh

39
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,180
what's been going on with you a little

40
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,640
bit about yourself

41
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:44,100
yeah so for those of you that don't know

42
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,259
me my name is Colin Bell

43
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:48,239
um I'm actually a scientist by in my

44
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:51,180
background training I have a PhD in soil

45
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:53,819
microbiology I studied at Texas Tech

46
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,799
University from there I moved over to

47
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:57,898
Fort Collins Colorado where I worked at

48
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:00,659
the natural resource ecology Center at

49
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:03,359
Colorado State University and I worked

50
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:05,100
for years in all my academic uh and

51
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:06,780
research background is focused on

52
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:09,239
understanding the importance of plant

53
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:11,939
microbe interactions did a lot of

54
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:14,878
studies uh published a lot of papers

55
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:17,939
in both natural and agriculture systems

56
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:20,399
and just basically got a really sound

57
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:22,318
fundamental understanding of how

58
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,140
microbes work with plants to support

59
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:26,939
plant growth and in these different

60
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:29,939
environments including Precision

61
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:34,079
agriculture systems and indoor growing

62
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:36,780
awesome you also were the founder or

63
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,280
creator of Mammoth p

64
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,000
so I want to mention that that's pretty

65
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,939
cool

66
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,300
um and now uh you're currently working

67
00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:48,239
over at microbial mass is that correct

68
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:49,800
yeah that's right so you know I was the

69
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,080
co-founder of Mammoth microbes the

70
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,640
inventor of that technology and a lot of

71
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,120
people probably know me because of that

72
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:58,979
that's been a really amazing journey and

73
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,439
I learned a lot doing that

74
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:03,598
ultimately and it was at the very end of

75
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:06,719
last year in October last year I made

76
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:08,699
the choice to leave uh the organization

77
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:10,259
for a lot of reasons one that kind of

78
00:03:08,699 --> 00:03:11,699
got to the size

79
00:03:10,259 --> 00:03:12,719
um where I thought it was going a

80
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:15,359
different direction that I didn't

81
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:17,459
necessarily want to go and it wasn't in

82
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,560
the vision but when you get to a larger

83
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:21,780
size organization and bring people in

84
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:25,319
and Outsiders and investors

85
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:27,539
you start to lose control and maybe um

86
00:03:25,318 --> 00:03:29,458
sword from the sort of away from their

87
00:03:27,539 --> 00:03:32,818
original vision and intention you had

88
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:35,580
for the organization so I wanted to

89
00:03:32,818 --> 00:03:36,958
follow my path and I left it took some

90
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,400
time off and I've done some fun stuff

91
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,340
and you and I were talking about some of

92
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:44,099
those things ultimately I'm trying to

93
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:47,340
follow my passion and trying to really

94
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:49,679
enjoy my professional career to the

95
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:53,519
fullest and I enjoy that by working with

96
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,860
people that I really enjoy working with

97
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,379
um that are go-getters and that I can

98
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:01,319
trust and have a lot of fun with and

99
00:03:58,378 --> 00:04:02,039
along with that I have to work with

100
00:04:01,318 --> 00:04:05,399
um

101
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:07,798
companies that I believe in and not only

102
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,239
from a mission and vision but from a

103
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:11,219
technology and Innovation point of view

104
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:12,959
so it has to kind of fit my expertise

105
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:16,560
which is a microbial and natural

106
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:18,540
Technologies for agriculture so I'm very

107
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,358
passionate about agriculture Innovation

108
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:22,699
and figuring out how to formulate and

109
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,379
how to

110
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:27,720
develop

111
00:04:24,379 --> 00:04:28,978
nature and nature solutions to fit into

112
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,759
conventional agriculture management

113
00:04:28,978 --> 00:04:34,800
practices and the mass microbial Mass

114
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:37,379
Technologies MIM Horticulture is the

115
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,060
name of the company out of Canada has

116
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:40,680
done some very interesting things that

117
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:42,000
intrigue me not only from a team

118
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,100
perspective but from a technology

119
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,660
perspective and so I'm really happy to

120
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,919
be helping them develop their business

121
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,860
in the U.S

122
00:04:46,918 --> 00:04:52,680
yeah I was kind of uh blindsided because

123
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:54,720
you and I had talked and uh I was just

124
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,918
asking what you were up to and you know

125
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,259
you weren't doing anything and the next

126
00:04:55,918 --> 00:05:00,000
thing I knew I hear from another friend

127
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:02,220
that you're working over at microbial

128
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,918
Mass so I had to call up my buddy David

129
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:06,720
David Bernard perone and he was kind of

130
00:05:04,918 --> 00:05:08,698
filling me in and then

131
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,860
um Francois who actually was the one who

132
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:12,720
developed microbial Mass uh as another

133
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:14,220
friend of mine who I haven't talked to

134
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,380
in a little while but

135
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,940
um he's an awesome researcher and so I'm

136
00:05:16,379 --> 00:05:19,860
excited to see you guys working together

137
00:05:17,939 --> 00:05:22,259
and

138
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:24,000
um yeah before we dive into like the

139
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:26,639
real meat of the podcast tell me just a

140
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,319
little bit about microbial mass and what

141
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,918
you find interesting about it as a

142
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:34,978
microbial you know biostimulant

143
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:37,139
yeah thank you and I'll just uh mention

144
00:05:34,978 --> 00:05:39,360
that you know David and Francois are two

145
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:40,680
of the reasons when I speak up team and

146
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,199
people that I really want to work with

147
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,879
and have fun working with uh was part of

148
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,100
the decision making for me joining this

149
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:49,500
group great guys a lot of fun I know you

150
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:51,120
know them both very well and you know I

151
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,918
really geeked out as a microbiologist

152
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,160
and someone that really wants to apply

153
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:57,959
microbiology in the market uh with

154
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,020
technology and microbial Technologies

155
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:04,319
and the approach that I took with

156
00:06:01,019 --> 00:06:06,839
Mammoth P was a quite different approach

157
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:09,240
this group took quite a different

158
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:10,739
approach which which intrigued me and it

159
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,418
was something I've been trying to do or

160
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:15,060
wanting to do

161
00:06:12,418 --> 00:06:18,359
um with the grosincia group when I was

162
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:19,019
you know an operational founder and you

163
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,379
know

164
00:06:19,019 --> 00:06:24,839
a member of that particular team and I

165
00:06:22,379 --> 00:06:27,418
saw this group being able to execute

166
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:29,579
that well so it's really fun and and the

167
00:06:27,418 --> 00:06:31,019
difference is I think are Precision to

168
00:06:29,579 --> 00:06:32,939
be fair

169
00:06:31,019 --> 00:06:35,939
um there are some certain functionality

170
00:06:32,939 --> 00:06:38,459
that we nurtured in Mammoth P targeting

171
00:06:35,939 --> 00:06:40,199
phosphorus cycling but there was a lot

172
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:42,599
of unknowns that were occurring in that

173
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:45,900
particular formula as well and as a

174
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:48,479
microbial ecologist soil ecologist I

175
00:06:45,899 --> 00:06:50,459
embraced those unknowns knowing that

176
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:52,500
there's not everything we're ever going

177
00:06:50,459 --> 00:06:55,198
to learn about plants and microbial

178
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:57,439
function but uh believing that a lot of

179
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:00,538
those things could enhance

180
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:02,759
plant success and there could be a lot

181
00:07:00,538 --> 00:07:05,818
of functional redundancies that could

182
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:08,280
help help plants grow successfully

183
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:09,960
across the growing season without us

184
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:11,038
necessarily understanding what they all

185
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:14,099
are

186
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:17,639
what I felt like the import culture

187
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:19,580
group did really well was work with

188
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:23,098
super defined

189
00:07:19,579 --> 00:07:25,079
carrier super defined formula and really

190
00:07:23,098 --> 00:07:28,819
honing in on the functionality of the

191
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:33,538
microbes that we're using to not only uh

192
00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:36,120
present a a very specific microbe with a

193
00:07:33,538 --> 00:07:38,879
very specific function uh for the

194
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:41,579
industry but it eliminates a lot of the

195
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:43,860
unknowns and it made me think of

196
00:07:41,579 --> 00:07:45,779
something that was pretty common in the

197
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:48,120
industry now at least from the salt and

198
00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:48,959
the hydro Growers was this aspect of

199
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:53,098
clean

200
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:55,079
and a lot of the clean uh speak around

201
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:57,478
growing plants now and keeping it as

202
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:59,399
clean as sterile as possible that's not

203
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:01,318
necessarily something I completely agree

204
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:03,239
with but I understand it's the Paradigm

205
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:05,939
and a lot of people want to start

206
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:08,699
focusing on that aspect of growing

207
00:08:05,939 --> 00:08:11,098
and I felt like if there was a way that

208
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:14,460
we could incorporate microbes into a

209
00:08:11,098 --> 00:08:16,379
clean grow environment it would help the

210
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:18,478
grower but we had to figure out how to

211
00:08:16,379 --> 00:08:20,219
do that well and I feel like this group

212
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:23,818
has done that with this particular

213
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:26,099
formula it's the first clean microbial

214
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:28,379
solution where everything's very well

215
00:08:26,098 --> 00:08:31,079
defined and they're using dormant

216
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:33,300
bacteria to deliver to the plants and so

217
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:36,778
it works through uh the irrigation

218
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:39,000
fertigation system completely virtually

219
00:08:36,778 --> 00:08:41,158
sterile because of the dormancy of the

220
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,038
microbes and the microbes actually

221
00:08:41,158 --> 00:08:45,720
activate when they get to plant roots to

222
00:08:44,038 --> 00:08:48,958
stimulate plant growth across the

223
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:50,700
growing season the mass product in

224
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:53,039
particular has done a couple of things

225
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:55,080
they have a couple microbes that they

226
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:58,199
Quantified really well in the laboratory

227
00:08:55,080 --> 00:09:01,080
and in grow environments to increase the

228
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:03,060
mass of early stage rooting and then

229
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:05,100
three of the other microbes in this

230
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:07,619
particular product are focused on later

231
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:09,440
stage phosphor cycling and so it's a

232
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:11,519
really interesting one-two crunch

233
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,519
maximizing the plant's ability to

234
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,320
establish early on and then to uptake

235
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:19,679
nutrients later on in the growth cycle

236
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:22,278
to maximize their ability to stack and

237
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:25,019
yield hmm

238
00:09:22,278 --> 00:09:26,820
so there's you don't have the same

239
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:29,039
issues with biofilm build up I would

240
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:31,080
assume if you're if you're looking at

241
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:33,120
dormant bacteria

242
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:37,500
um and then this product was developed

243
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:39,778
uh I believe or discovered uh out of

244
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:42,299
David's grow when he was at Whistler

245
00:09:39,778 --> 00:09:43,399
Medical on the Cannabis side so the

246
00:09:42,299 --> 00:09:46,019
product was actually

247
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:49,320
derived and correct me if I'm wrong here

248
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:51,659
but from that sort of uh relationship

249
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:55,379
co-evolution of these particular

250
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:59,100
bacteria with cannabis plants

251
00:09:55,379 --> 00:10:01,320
yeah how how I understand it product was

252
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:03,360
it developed but the microbes were

253
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,040
identified yes in that environment yeah

254
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,560
and so they were identified then they

255
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:09,240
were selected and then scaled up and

256
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:11,579
that's where the product formulation the

257
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,320
product development formulation process

258
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:15,839
took over where they utilized the

259
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:17,760
microbes from the cannabis grow to

260
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:20,040
create a formula a clean formula to

261
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:22,319
carry them in to make it very compatible

262
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:25,259
not only for living soil Growers but

263
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,120
also for clean salt hydroponic Growers

264
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:28,200
yeah I think and I think you bring up an

265
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:33,320
important Point there's a big difference

266
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:35,000
between clean and sterile you can have

267
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:37,440
microbial

268
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,360
interactions going on in your soil and

269
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,480
not be sterile but still have a clean

270
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:46,139
room and you know we're not throwing out

271
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:48,899
all the IPM processes around keeping

272
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:50,578
your area clean

273
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:52,320
um so I just want to highlight that and

274
00:10:50,578 --> 00:10:54,958
then you know

275
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,240
I'm kind of going off topic here a

276
00:10:54,958 --> 00:11:02,159
little bit but you and I just uh both

277
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:05,879
attended a uh webinar by uh Dr punja

278
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:07,078
talking about hop latent viroid and one

279
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:10,379
of the things that he pointed out around

280
00:11:07,078 --> 00:11:12,179
it was that it damages root mass in in

281
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:14,458
clones

282
00:11:12,179 --> 00:11:16,078
um he had a lot of interesting points

283
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:18,059
around it you know in terms of mothers

284
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:20,399
most mothers being plants being

285
00:11:18,059 --> 00:11:23,759
asymptomatic and and

286
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,720
um just the prevalence of this viroid in

287
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:27,958
our

288
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,339
in our in the in the plants that we are

289
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:32,639
currently cultivating

290
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:35,279
um but I wonder if we could have a

291
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:37,139
reduction in symptoms if we can get some

292
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:39,240
microbial products

293
00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:41,039
that potentially could increase root

294
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:44,220
mass to offset some of the damage that

295
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:45,838
we're seeing from a viroid yeah I think

296
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:47,639
I think conceptually that's exactly

297
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,980
right what we heard in that in that

298
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:51,419
particular presentation which was very

299
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:53,820
well done

300
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:56,519
um was that in a lot of cases it

301
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:58,379
silences genes in the plants among a lot

302
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:00,480
a host of other things that the viroid

303
00:11:58,379 --> 00:12:03,659
does to the plant to help kind of deter

304
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,700
its maximum success uh limit or

305
00:12:03,659 --> 00:12:08,278
diminishes root growth diminishes

306
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:11,399
trichome production diminishes overall

307
00:12:08,278 --> 00:12:13,139
yield diminishes stem stability but the

308
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:15,480
gene silencing which I thought was

309
00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:17,939
pretty interesting also because that's

310
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:20,820
going to silence a lot of the resistance

311
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:23,279
genes in these plants and so the idea is

312
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:25,680
maximizing the plant Health to its full

313
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:27,299
potential and there's a there's a strong

314
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:29,939
argument that if you have the beneficial

315
00:12:27,299 --> 00:12:31,919
microbes occupying the rhizospheric root

316
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:34,380
Zone it's going to maximize the plant's

317
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:36,419
ability to fend off uh particular

318
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:40,320
pathogens the other piece of that was

319
00:12:36,419 --> 00:12:42,958
fascinating the the thyroid

320
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,000
populating viroid actually makes plants

321
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:47,338
more susceptible to bacterial infections

322
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,839
and so you can almost offset that with

323
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:50,760
beneficials because there's a

324
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:53,100
probability gain

325
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:55,259
um life is a probability and if you can

326
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:57,778
occupy a space with beneficials it's

327
00:12:55,259 --> 00:12:58,860
going to be harder for pathogens to come

328
00:12:57,778 --> 00:13:00,958
in and

329
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:03,419
affect your plan

330
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:05,518
yeah well let's

331
00:13:03,419 --> 00:13:08,699
um getting back to the outline that I

332
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,379
had for this conversation today uh one

333
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:12,899
of the things that I thought would be

334
00:13:10,379 --> 00:13:14,879
really useful to ask you is how do we

335
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:16,500
grow microbes you know this is something

336
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:17,879
that you're you've had a lot of

337
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,620
experience on especially when you're

338
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:21,958
developing your product

339
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:24,360
um but for the home that the home

340
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:25,379
cultivator or a commercial grower you

341
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,820
know they're not they're not they don't

342
00:13:25,379 --> 00:13:29,220
have a lab

343
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:32,459
um they're probably getting things off

344
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:35,579
the shelf as food sources and and trying

345
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:40,799
to use microbes like maybe lactobacillus

346
00:13:35,578 --> 00:13:42,539
or maybe extend uh a microbial product I

347
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:45,359
already have where how would someone

348
00:13:42,539 --> 00:13:47,639
begin to start

349
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,220
I don't know doing this process

350
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:52,379
it's really simple uh and it can be a

351
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:54,480
lot of fun I recommend it for everybody

352
00:13:52,379 --> 00:13:57,240
and I used to teach at the University

353
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,940
when I was a student I would teach labs

354
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:01,440
and we would culture microbes from the

355
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,760
environment and so that's a really fun

356
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,180
way to start if you're thinking about

357
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:08,519
growing microbes and I've had people uh

358
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:11,638
like take a sterile swab you can take a

359
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:14,480
sterile Q-tip and the growing microbes

360
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:18,060
I'm going to start is not as complicated

361
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:19,860
as keeping them pristine meaning growing

362
00:14:18,059 --> 00:14:22,739
the microbes you want to grow and

363
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:25,139
preventing from contamination we talk we

364
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:26,579
use the word sterile a minute ago and

365
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:29,240
that's something that comes up sometimes

366
00:14:26,578 --> 00:14:34,439
in cultivation facilities but in general

367
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:37,139
it's a misnomer there's no chance that

368
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:40,139
sterility exists in the environment it's

369
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:42,360
a probability but sterility just doesn't

370
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:44,940
happen yeah it might be able to happen

371
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:47,579
for a short period of time but you can

372
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:49,920
grow there's a a lot of different

373
00:14:47,578 --> 00:14:51,719
food sources that you can make or you

374
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:52,740
can actually commercially buy and

375
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,000
they're pretty

376
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,139
uh

377
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,220
cheap

378
00:14:55,139 --> 00:15:03,240
to grow microbes and so just like you

379
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:05,820
and I microbes or heterotrophs they eat

380
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:07,860
food and they respire carbon and they

381
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:10,019
take in oxygen and so you can just

382
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:12,839
create any kind of food source and you

383
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:15,179
will grow microbes the interesting thing

384
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:18,000
about growing microbes is some favor of

385
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:20,039
some food sources over the others and so

386
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,139
there's a lot of different media you can

387
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:24,599
use to maximize

388
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:28,198
the success of growing certain strains

389
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:29,879
there's uh Bibles of microbiology so to

390
00:15:28,198 --> 00:15:32,039
speak it's the methods of microbiology

391
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:34,439
where they have thousands of different

392
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:36,299
microbial Medias and they have the

393
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,440
actual formulas for them and so it's a

394
00:15:36,299 --> 00:15:39,599
really interesting book you can

395
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,459
reference you can probably buy online

396
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,459
you can definitely pick up at a library

397
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:45,599
or a University library for sure and

398
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:47,338
just look at all these different

399
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,320
ingredients there's typically sugar

400
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:51,839
sources and there's particularly protein

401
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:53,639
sources and there could be a liquid

402
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,560
solution or it can be in a solidified

403
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:58,440
solution where you have an auger gel

404
00:15:55,559 --> 00:16:01,799
from polysaccharide to help solidify

405
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:03,959
that and streak microbes or streak

406
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:05,879
something that you've collected from the

407
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:08,399
environment on a plate or just put it in

408
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:11,519
a broth and microbes will grow

409
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:15,240
you can actually leave these plates out

410
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:17,220
um just exposed for minutes close them

411
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,379
up and you can grow microbes from the

412
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:22,199
air and you'll see growth in less than a

413
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:23,539
week easily so it's very simple to grow

414
00:16:22,198 --> 00:16:26,698
microbes

415
00:16:23,539 --> 00:16:29,099
understanding the microbes that you want

416
00:16:26,698 --> 00:16:31,799
to grow and how to optimize that growth

417
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:34,159
becomes a lot more sophisticated and

418
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:37,379
with all kind of microbial production

419
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:41,519
the growing of microbes is typically not

420
00:16:37,379 --> 00:16:44,578
the Crux it's the maintaining the

421
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:47,039
the purity of that microbial culture is

422
00:16:44,578 --> 00:16:49,138
what becomes very challenging and so the

423
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:51,120
aseptic transfer and technique which is

424
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:54,959
your sterile technique of transferring

425
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:57,299
uh from one one place to another uh your

426
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:58,799
microbe becomes most of the risk when

427
00:16:57,299 --> 00:17:01,319
you're growing microbes

428
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:03,120
that's why it's really hard to have a

429
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:05,818
consistent microbial formula over time

430
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:08,599
and I imagine most people if they tested

431
00:17:05,818 --> 00:17:11,699
their lactobacillus or any of their

432
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:12,918
concoctions that we make which is cool

433
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:15,779
and I love it

434
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:18,540
and including microbial teas I think

435
00:17:15,779 --> 00:17:21,178
we'll find very different microbial

436
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:23,699
assemblages in those over time from

437
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:25,259
batch to batch seasonally there's from

438
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:28,740
the Water Source there's so many

439
00:17:25,259 --> 00:17:30,779
different sources that can affect that

440
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:34,259
microbial community in the in the

441
00:17:30,779 --> 00:17:36,119
structure of that over time

442
00:17:34,259 --> 00:17:39,240
yeah so I came into this industry

443
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:41,639
through the aerated compost tea World

444
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:44,460
um and what you're saying really holds

445
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:46,200
true for for my experience too and and

446
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:47,340
that was that

447
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,779
um

448
00:17:47,339 --> 00:17:51,720
you know every batch is going to be

449
00:17:48,779 --> 00:17:54,418
different we're not identifying these

450
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:57,779
particular strains or species

451
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:59,460
but by having sufficient levels of

452
00:17:57,779 --> 00:18:03,178
oxygen and selecting an aerobic

453
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:05,279
environment and using an a source of

454
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:07,019
material in this case compost that we

455
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:09,720
know to be fairly

456
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:11,519
free of pathogens we're we're hopefully

457
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:15,000
like tilting the scales in the direction

458
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:17,038
of more beneficial microorganisms or at

459
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,720
the very least what I think and when I

460
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:20,460
talk about compost tea you know people

461
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,140
make claims that I think are just crazy

462
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:23,759
around it

463
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,780
um like for me the idea of disease

464
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:26,940
suppression and some of these other

465
00:18:24,779 --> 00:18:29,519
things may occur but like like you said

466
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:30,779
every batch is going to be or like I

467
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:33,200
said I guess every batch is going to be

468
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:35,279
different and we can't get replication

469
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,400
consistently so it'd be really hard to

470
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:40,319
make any conclusions

471
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:42,419
or even determine any Trends over over

472
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:44,339
time but what I think is interesting

473
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:47,340
about is can we get nutrients functional

474
00:18:44,339 --> 00:18:49,500
like nutrient cycling like in a tea that

475
00:18:47,339 --> 00:18:52,740
we can apply to the soil that would

476
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:54,660
allow us to increase the you know that

477
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:57,779
microbial Loop that nutrient cycling

478
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:59,700
going on on some level through sort of

479
00:18:57,779 --> 00:19:02,038
this like shotgun approach

480
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:05,279
totally and that's I think the answer is

481
00:19:02,038 --> 00:19:07,740
uh absolutely positively yes and it's

482
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:10,139
because of the way microbes work and

483
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:13,019
what I would say is the a really

484
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:15,780
practical goal for a tea or having just

485
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:20,279
a mixed Consortium of microbes is having

486
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:24,660
a critical mass uh a number I count uh

487
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:26,279
of threshold biomass that gets to a

488
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:27,298
certain level where it can function at a

489
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:30,660
very high level

490
00:19:27,298 --> 00:19:33,839
and it doesn't necessarily matter

491
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:36,840
who's in there in every case if you're

492
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:38,879
trying to get a general nutrient cycling

493
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:41,279
function out of a microbial group you

494
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,500
want to make sure there are no pathogens

495
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:45,178
and you can make the assumption that

496
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,279
there's enough functional redundancy

497
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:48,840
that you're going to have microbes that

498
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:51,480
under different conditions are going to

499
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:52,980
step up and perform the function that

500
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,079
may be another microbial group that

501
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:57,779
performs the same function can't under a

502
00:19:55,079 --> 00:19:59,759
certain environment and I've you see

503
00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:02,399
that a lot in nature I don't see it any

504
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:03,779
different than in natural systems and I

505
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,400
used to do a lot of work in desert

506
00:20:03,779 --> 00:20:07,980
ecosystems so we used to talk a lot

507
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:10,380
about functional redundancy because the

508
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:12,480
environment was so extreme that you'd

509
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:14,700
find different microbial groups that you

510
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,038
could you could test them and they would

511
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:18,660
do the same thing functionally but they

512
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:21,179
would have very different environmental

513
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:23,700
thresholds and some would work much

514
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:25,080
better in drier conditions or in warmer

515
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:28,440
conditions and similar to work better

516
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:30,839
and colder conditions under pH stress

517
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:32,279
and so having the functional redundancy

518
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:35,459
I think is a plus

519
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:37,379
and the real value in those cases is

520
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:39,360
making sure you have a certain

521
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:41,400
concentration so you can maximize the

522
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:43,500
functionality and so there's going to be

523
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,960
this asymptote if you want me to draw a

524
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:47,400
line here with my hand where the lower

525
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,319
the concentration you're going to get

526
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:51,240
lower functionality then at some point

527
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:53,519
it's just going to reach this critical

528
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:55,259
threshold where you're maximizing your

529
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:57,599
functionality as a function of the

530
00:20:55,259 --> 00:21:00,779
biomass or the concentration of microbes

531
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:03,839
and reaching that without any potential

532
00:21:00,779 --> 00:21:06,178
pathogens would be I think that the

533
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:08,159
Target that you're trying to go for in a

534
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:11,759
t or any kind of microbial concoction

535
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:13,740
that's generally defined

536
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:15,058
yes so when you say functional

537
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:18,720
redundancy essentially what you're

538
00:21:15,058 --> 00:21:22,200
saying is uh just as just to reiterate

539
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:24,779
in a desert system for example let's say

540
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:30,360
uh Cactus needs

541
00:21:24,779 --> 00:21:32,579
phosphorus and there is a particular uh

542
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:35,639
strain of bacteria that's very good at

543
00:21:32,579 --> 00:21:39,000
cycling phosphorus when it is

544
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:40,559
very cold out and then it heats up that

545
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,538
bacteria is potentially going to go

546
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:44,940
dormant die off well the plant still

547
00:21:42,538 --> 00:21:46,679
needs phosphorus well another microbe

548
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:48,720
that maybe doesn't function at cold

549
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:50,640
temperatures but functions quite well at

550
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,460
hot temperatures say over 100 degrees

551
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,620
Fahrenheit is going to reproduce and

552
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:57,538
cycle nutrients and provide phosphorus

553
00:21:55,619 --> 00:22:00,000
for that plant under those conditions

554
00:21:57,538 --> 00:22:02,759
and all and so they they essentially can

555
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:06,380
occupy the same ecological niche for the

556
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:09,419
plant which is phosphorus cycling yet

557
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:11,340
coexist and and not really compete with

558
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:12,919
each other because they're functioning

559
00:22:11,339 --> 00:22:15,000
at different

560
00:22:12,919 --> 00:22:16,980
variables and like you said it could be

561
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:21,619
pH it could be water it could be heat it

562
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:21,620
could be cold does that kind of

563
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:25,798
that's exactly how it works in nature

564
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:28,320
and that's exactly how it would work in

565
00:22:25,798 --> 00:22:31,139
in farming for our Precision agriculture

566
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:33,019
indoor growing pH is the example that I

567
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:36,259
think is the most prevalent

568
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:39,058
environmental Factor affecting microbial

569
00:22:36,259 --> 00:22:40,740
success there's a assault concentration

570
00:22:39,058 --> 00:22:43,079
with nutrients and all the just

571
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:46,019
conventional management practices and pH

572
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:49,199
is a big part of that also pH actually

573
00:22:46,019 --> 00:22:51,720
is shown to predicate microbial

574
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,700
diversity and Community composition more

575
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:56,100
than any other Factor being the

576
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:58,500
strongest factor to manipulate microbial

577
00:22:56,099 --> 00:23:00,658
community structure across the world and

578
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:03,419
so you look at different conditions for

579
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:05,039
different soil types whatever out of all

580
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:09,299
the factors there might be temperature

581
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:11,339
water PH others pH is the first

582
00:23:09,298 --> 00:23:13,079
determining factor and I think it's

583
00:23:11,339 --> 00:23:16,019
interesting for indoor growing but as

584
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:17,639
you can have pH shifts you try to avoid

585
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:20,400
that but that happens

586
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:22,320
and so with functional redundancy you

587
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:25,320
have microbes that are able to persist

588
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:28,259
and function through those shifts and

589
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:30,960
kind of uh kind of overall Bridge a

590
00:23:28,259 --> 00:23:33,538
functional Gap where a single microbe

591
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:36,120
might work really well at a certain pH

592
00:23:33,538 --> 00:23:38,940
let's say seven but it might be very

593
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:41,279
stressed at a pH of five and so that

594
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:42,900
would not be the best microbe in that

595
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:45,418
particular environment and having

596
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:47,820
another backup microbe that worked well

597
00:23:45,419 --> 00:23:51,299
across the range of that particular

598
00:23:47,819 --> 00:23:53,359
environmental threshold pH would would

599
00:23:51,298 --> 00:23:55,798
serve uh would serve the plant better

600
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:59,038
that's really interesting

601
00:23:55,798 --> 00:24:01,019
um I think it's important for people to

602
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:04,440
keep in mind that

603
00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:07,798
we tend to think in like

604
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:10,320
black and white but the reality of this

605
00:24:07,798 --> 00:24:13,139
the complexity of the rhizosphere is

606
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:15,119
that like the soil may have a pH that

607
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:17,100
we're getting but like within that soil

608
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:19,319
there's all these little micro Pockets

609
00:24:17,099 --> 00:24:21,658
where the pH might be a little bit

610
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:22,859
different where hydrology might be a

611
00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:25,020
little bit different

612
00:24:22,859 --> 00:24:28,259
um and and that's where these these

613
00:24:25,019 --> 00:24:29,519
little ecological niches occur and it's

614
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:31,919
hard for me to wrap my brain around

615
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:34,500
because it they're it's so small and

616
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:36,120
it's constantly changing like this idea

617
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,980
that you're the microbes in your soil

618
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:40,439
are always changing I think is really

619
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:43,860
really important because when we start

620
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:46,380
getting into these like General

621
00:24:43,859 --> 00:24:49,619
uh the thoughts of like fungal to

622
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:53,520
bacteria Ratio or

623
00:24:49,619 --> 00:24:55,558
um you know overall biomass if my soil

624
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:58,200
is always changing how can we use those

625
00:24:55,558 --> 00:24:59,759
metrics to really make informed

626
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,080
decisions

627
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:03,538
um just due to the variability and

628
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:06,418
fluctuation of it

629
00:25:03,538 --> 00:25:09,900
that's a great question I'm going to add

630
00:25:06,419 --> 00:25:11,159
to that that you know in soils if you

631
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:12,900
compare the different types of

632
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:14,640
substrates let's say that plants might

633
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:16,320
grow in in agriculture or indoor

634
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,480
agriculture it can go from soil all the

635
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:21,418
way to soils media then on the far

636
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:23,519
extreme let's just say rockwool and so

637
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:26,038
there's different buffering capacities

638
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:27,720
across those substrates that very

639
00:25:26,038 --> 00:25:30,058
substantially if you think about the

640
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:32,819
Rockwell scenario as the as the most

641
00:25:30,058 --> 00:25:34,079
extreme other example from soil those

642
00:25:32,819 --> 00:25:36,538
environments are going to change

643
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:39,000
dramatically with every watering event

644
00:25:36,538 --> 00:25:40,500
because as the ions coming through and

645
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,500
it kind of drains through it doesn't

646
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:46,079
have a huge buffering capacity and so

647
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:50,099
you really want to be

648
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:51,720
um diligent on phing the solution before

649
00:25:50,099 --> 00:25:53,399
you water your plant because you can

650
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:55,200
stress that but microbes work really

651
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:58,140
well in those environments

652
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:00,419
on the whole other extreme I think about

653
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:02,220
soil where it's more buffered and in the

654
00:26:00,419 --> 00:26:04,200
rhizosphere and you think about

655
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:08,159
microbiology and scale is a really

656
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:12,058
interesting topic microbes are

657
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:16,140
just micrometers you know which is such

658
00:26:12,058 --> 00:26:18,058
a small uh just a such a small size that

659
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:20,340
obviously it's microscopic you can't see

660
00:26:18,058 --> 00:26:23,278
it with the naked eye but if you saw it

661
00:26:20,339 --> 00:26:26,099
along the tiniest route here

662
00:26:23,278 --> 00:26:28,619
it would just be a speck even from a

663
00:26:26,099 --> 00:26:30,538
magnification and so the environments

664
00:26:28,619 --> 00:26:32,278
that it gets that that it created along

665
00:26:30,538 --> 00:26:35,759
with the root zone or the rhizosphere

666
00:26:32,278 --> 00:26:37,140
are are highly buffered and so I think

667
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:39,720
that you're going to have an ebb and

668
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:41,220
flow of different populations but

669
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:44,339
there's also I think about it as a

670
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:46,259
probability game where if there's

671
00:26:44,339 --> 00:26:48,599
um successful microbes in that

672
00:26:46,259 --> 00:26:50,278
environment they're going to swell and

673
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:52,139
Shrink depending on certain

674
00:26:50,278 --> 00:26:54,298
circumstances as far as their overall

675
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:56,400
population or growth but they're

676
00:26:54,298 --> 00:26:59,759
probably going to remain there and they

677
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:02,100
might not completely turn over uh to a

678
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:04,440
completely different group you might

679
00:27:02,099 --> 00:27:06,658
have some additions coming in but I

680
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:08,278
don't think that the turnover is as

681
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:10,919
Extreme as much as the ebbing and

682
00:27:08,278 --> 00:27:12,240
swelling would be so it's kind of a

683
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:13,980
probability game

684
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,599
yeah and then the other thing that

685
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:17,759
further complicates it is the life

686
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:21,178
cycles of these microbes the generations

687
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:24,000
of them are so fast so just within a

688
00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:26,460
given flowering cycle we have

689
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,140
co-evolution happening on a microscopic

690
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:29,880
scale and so

691
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:32,759
like and I think I've mentioned this in

692
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:34,740
previous podcasts but I talked to uh my

693
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:36,179
good friend Nate Gibbs over at Gold Leaf

694
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:38,759
Gardens and you know they've had their

695
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:40,440
soil in their beds for over eight years

696
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:42,839
now and like that's his intellectual

697
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:45,600
property at this point that's what gives

698
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:47,819
him something different than everyone

699
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:49,859
else on the market because the microbes

700
00:27:47,819 --> 00:27:51,359
in that soil I mean we'll call it

701
00:27:49,859 --> 00:27:53,339
microbes but the nutrient levels the

702
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:56,038
microbes the pH all of those things are

703
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:58,199
unique to him it's no longer the soil

704
00:27:56,038 --> 00:28:00,900
that he got from me eight years ago it's

705
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:02,640
it's his own his own thing and I think

706
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:04,860
that's really interesting

707
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,538
yeah that's totally cool you know I

708
00:28:04,859 --> 00:28:09,178
think the visual I would use to frame

709
00:28:06,538 --> 00:28:10,859
how microbes exist in any environment in

710
00:28:09,179 --> 00:28:13,140
the in the rice Assurance soil that's

711
00:28:10,859 --> 00:28:15,719
how I talk about it you know as a

712
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:18,299
community starts off it's just a very

713
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:21,058
low concentration or a certain single

714
00:28:18,298 --> 00:28:23,400
micro and they call that the lag phase

715
00:28:21,058 --> 00:28:25,319
of the microbial growth curve and at

716
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:27,798
some point with uh

717
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:31,798
there's typically a lot of food resource

718
00:28:27,798 --> 00:28:33,480
ultimately that microbial group or that

719
00:28:31,798 --> 00:28:35,278
mass will get to a certain concentration

720
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:38,700
and they grow really quick and they

721
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:42,119
reproduce or clone out very quickly they

722
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:45,538
they split and they um asexually just

723
00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:47,399
clone out and in days they can really

724
00:28:45,538 --> 00:28:49,740
change their Mass but then they'll grow

725
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:52,140
into an exponential growth phase where

726
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:54,000
they'll just grow at a 10x rate in a

727
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:54,960
very quick in that environment very

728
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,380
quickly

729
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:01,380
and at some point they'll level up where

730
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:03,419
the food source equals the live death

731
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:05,520
and so the food source is sustaining

732
00:29:03,419 --> 00:29:09,960
that certain concentration of microbes

733
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:12,480
and if that that just that longer growth

734
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:14,640
phase it's a life equals Death it's

735
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,679
called stationary where microbes are

736
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,840
turning over but they're reproducing at

737
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:20,700
about the same rate they're dying and so

738
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:23,298
they're maintaining this certain mass

739
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:26,580
and only when a food source or some

740
00:29:23,298 --> 00:29:29,278
environmental conditions really disrupt

741
00:29:26,579 --> 00:29:31,259
that particular Mass you get this death

742
00:29:29,278 --> 00:29:34,079
phase going down where the concentration

743
00:29:31,259 --> 00:29:36,658
starts to decline rapidly and so that

744
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:38,879
that stationary growth phase can can

745
00:29:36,659 --> 00:29:41,640
persist for a very long period of time

746
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:43,740
and it's just indicative of the microbe

747
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:45,720
being very happy in that environment and

748
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:47,460
having enough of a food source and a

749
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:51,240
long enough life cycle

750
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:53,100
to persist and have a have a pretty uh

751
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:55,980
predictable turnover if that makes sense

752
00:29:53,099 --> 00:29:57,480
yeah and when you say food sources uh

753
00:29:55,980 --> 00:30:00,058
that could be a variety of things that

754
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:02,700
could be exudates coming directly from

755
00:30:00,058 --> 00:30:06,778
the plant itself out of the roots it

756
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:10,798
could be uh a variety of organic

757
00:30:06,778 --> 00:30:12,659
uh matter uh things in or fertilizer for

758
00:30:10,798 --> 00:30:13,980
for that for example it could be you

759
00:30:12,659 --> 00:30:15,600
know a little bit of alfalfa meal a

760
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:18,200
little bit of feather or fishbone meal

761
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:21,359
it could be salts let's talk about

762
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:23,100
mineral salts how do they affect

763
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:25,500
microbes

764
00:30:23,099 --> 00:30:27,538
yeah it's a great question so

765
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:30,960
um a lot of people think that mineral

766
00:30:27,538 --> 00:30:34,140
salts actually kill microbes and I'm

767
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:37,019
here to tell you that's not necessarily

768
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:39,899
the truth it all depended on time and

769
00:30:37,019 --> 00:30:41,639
concentration for even disinfectant

770
00:30:39,898 --> 00:30:44,278
Solutions I'll tell you what I've I've

771
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:46,620
tried to kill microbes before a robust

772
00:30:44,278 --> 00:30:48,058
microbial formulas and I've had a very

773
00:30:46,619 --> 00:30:50,579
hard time doing it even with

774
00:30:48,058 --> 00:30:54,119
commercially available products hydrogen

775
00:30:50,579 --> 00:30:56,879
peroxide chlorine Solutions and it comes

776
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:59,219
down to the concentration of the

777
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:02,039
solution and the time and over time

778
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:05,038
those are the two factors that you have

779
00:31:02,038 --> 00:31:06,658
to dial in in order to successfully kill

780
00:31:05,038 --> 00:31:10,379
microbes in general

781
00:31:06,659 --> 00:31:12,659
in in practice I've never seen microbes

782
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:15,960
really die off through us through um

783
00:31:12,659 --> 00:31:18,120
just a fertigation practice I actually

784
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:20,700
had a hard time again killing microbes

785
00:31:18,119 --> 00:31:22,558
through just uh recommended practices of

786
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:24,298
most disinfectants that are recommended

787
00:31:22,558 --> 00:31:27,000
in our industry cleaning lines and

788
00:31:24,298 --> 00:31:29,278
whatnot it has to be a longer time and a

789
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,038
high concentration to significantly

790
00:31:29,278 --> 00:31:35,819
disrupt microbes

791
00:31:32,038 --> 00:31:40,079
so the the idea behind salts killing

792
00:31:35,819 --> 00:31:42,720
microbes is that they raise the uh

793
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:44,759
you know soluble salt level in the in

794
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:47,339
either the the media

795
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:50,220
or in the nutrient solution

796
00:31:47,339 --> 00:31:53,339
um so the EC of that to a level to where

797
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:56,220
the microbes through osmotic shock uh

798
00:31:53,339 --> 00:31:58,019
die essentially so

799
00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:00,600
um there's there's been this idea

800
00:31:58,019 --> 00:32:03,359
perpetuating industry that

801
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:05,099
mineral salts kill microbes but yet

802
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:07,979
there's research out there that I've

803
00:32:05,099 --> 00:32:11,459
seen that shows that uh mineral salts in

804
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:13,980
low doses actually feed microbes

805
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:16,079
um they're they're a source for

806
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:17,759
a food source

807
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:19,918
microbes

808
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:22,558
uh consume the same nutrients that

809
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:25,080
plants do and the only other nutrient

810
00:32:22,558 --> 00:32:28,139
that they get but not from the air from

811
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:29,460
the from the substrate is carbon and so

812
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:32,520
this is a pretty interesting

813
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:35,538
evolutionary uh evolutionary tool of

814
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:38,700
plants to feed

815
00:32:35,538 --> 00:32:41,038
photosynthate priming into the soil or

816
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:43,679
to the substrate to feed microbes the

817
00:32:41,038 --> 00:32:46,440
sugars that they take from the air they

818
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:49,380
consume some of the carbon to create

819
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:52,140
their biomass but they also shoot a lot

820
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:55,080
of that sugar into the soil to feed

821
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:58,380
microbes the carbon they need so the so

822
00:32:55,079 --> 00:33:01,259
the microbes can actively help cycle

823
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:03,120
nutrients to support their success and I

824
00:33:01,259 --> 00:33:05,519
I used to say this all the time but you

825
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:07,319
know microbes all plants in nature the

826
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:09,298
natural ones exist because of that

827
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:11,220
microbial relationship they have in the

828
00:33:09,298 --> 00:33:13,259
soil because the microbes actually help

829
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:16,319
them take up nutrients and

830
00:33:13,259 --> 00:33:18,898
if you're feeding soluble nutrients into

831
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:20,579
a solution and microbes are there

832
00:33:18,898 --> 00:33:22,619
they're absolutely going to take

833
00:33:20,579 --> 00:33:24,658
advantage of those just like the plants

834
00:33:22,619 --> 00:33:26,699
would and so I wouldn't call it a

835
00:33:24,659 --> 00:33:29,059
competition but there is a little bit of

836
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:29,058
a

837
00:33:29,778 --> 00:33:35,519
cohabitation of utilizing the resources

838
00:33:32,819 --> 00:33:37,500
in that particular environment

839
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:39,659
yeah I think that's just an important

840
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:41,940
point I want you to I wanted you to to

841
00:33:39,659 --> 00:33:44,039
make or to hear you say because you know

842
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:46,380
what we see from when we look at like uh

843
00:33:44,038 --> 00:33:48,000
competition vegetable Growers like giant

844
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:50,940
pumpkin Growers Tomatoes things like

845
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,940
that they're doing a combination of

846
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:56,278
organic inputs uh microbial stimulants

847
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:57,538
like micrizal fungus for example and

848
00:33:56,278 --> 00:34:00,778
then

849
00:33:57,538 --> 00:34:03,298
um levels of mineral salts and that's

850
00:34:00,778 --> 00:34:03,898
where we see the largest yields

851
00:34:03,298 --> 00:34:07,079
um

852
00:34:03,898 --> 00:34:08,699
and I I think like ultimately if we want

853
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:09,719
to talk about just growing the largest

854
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:11,638
plant

855
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:13,439
it would be this sort of this hybrid

856
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:14,519
method now I'm an organic guy and I

857
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,079
could I could absolutely make the

858
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:19,500
argument for why I choose not to use

859
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:22,079
mineral salts but I also want to be

860
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:24,000
pragmatic about it acknowledge that

861
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:26,759
you know if we're just talking about

862
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,739
yield or plant growth

863
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:30,480
um this hybrid method I think is really

864
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:32,699
the way to go

865
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,079
uh absolutely positively I mean that's

866
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:36,059
what I've seen also for a couple

867
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:39,299
different reasons I think that having

868
00:34:36,059 --> 00:34:40,559
that extra canvas if you will from my if

869
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:43,139
you were going to call microbes a

870
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:44,460
catalysts and they do uh oh not only act

871
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:46,440
as a cows but they create other

872
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:48,599
biomolecules that act as catalysts to

873
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:50,159
help cycle nutrients to help stimulate

874
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:53,639
the plants to want to take up more

875
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:55,919
nutrients I've seen uh the rhizosphere

876
00:34:53,639 --> 00:35:00,358
with beneficial bacteria protect plants

877
00:34:55,918 --> 00:35:02,879
from from infection from other pathogens

878
00:35:00,358 --> 00:35:05,039
that might come in just from ecological

879
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:08,338
niche Theory by itself

880
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:11,338
but these microbes can create different

881
00:35:08,338 --> 00:35:13,679
chemical signaling and analogous to

882
00:35:11,338 --> 00:35:15,539
hormones in some cases that they'll

883
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:17,338
stimulate plant growth which is a very

884
00:35:15,539 --> 00:35:19,800
interesting thing they obviously cycle

885
00:35:17,338 --> 00:35:21,480
nutrients which can become sticky and

886
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:23,760
not available to the plants especially

887
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:25,800
in soil phosphorus is a great example of

888
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,119
that or they can actually solubilize

889
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:30,060
that phosphorus and make it available

890
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:32,820
for the plant to uptake and so there's a

891
00:35:30,059 --> 00:35:35,940
lot of things these microbes do to help

892
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:38,460
plants across the growing season uh I I

893
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:40,500
guess one more one more example is and

894
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:43,619
this isn't as much in soils as it would

895
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:45,358
happen and and probably cocoa and in

896
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:47,820
rockwool in some cases and there's a

897
00:35:45,358 --> 00:35:50,098
lockout event that occurs in some cases

898
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:51,539
if there's a flooding of ions the plants

899
00:35:50,099 --> 00:35:54,000
aren't able to balance that out very

900
00:35:51,539 --> 00:35:56,400
well and microbes do a really good job

901
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,639
of balancing out plant nutrient uptake

902
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:02,220
how long the rhizosphere and root Zone

903
00:35:58,639 --> 00:36:04,559
and microbes can actually alleviate the

904
00:36:02,219 --> 00:36:06,000
potential for a walkout events and I

905
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:08,820
think that's a really really fascinating

906
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,880
thing that a lot of Growers probably

907
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:14,099
experience just without understanding it

908
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:15,740
you can have these really micro lockout

909
00:36:14,099 --> 00:36:18,720
events through

910
00:36:15,739 --> 00:36:20,279
just feeding salts the plants won't show

911
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:22,679
for days and the plants can probably

912
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:25,500
work out of it but it's a staggering

913
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:26,940
growth event that with microbes the

914
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:29,219
plants wouldn't feel that they could

915
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:31,858
focus all their energies into the into

916
00:36:29,219 --> 00:36:34,699
the upward growth of the plant instead

917
00:36:31,858 --> 00:36:36,900
of the plant being almost stunted

918
00:36:34,699 --> 00:36:38,639
although you couldn't measure that

919
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:41,519
necessarily just by watching the plant

920
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:44,039
grow as it's being fed pure salts over

921
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:47,219
across the growing season and I've had

922
00:36:44,039 --> 00:36:49,619
Growers that have used microbes that

923
00:36:47,219 --> 00:36:50,480
they were just feeding Rockwell's an

924
00:36:49,619 --> 00:36:52,858
example

925
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:55,019
assaults and they would add a microbial

926
00:36:52,858 --> 00:36:56,759
solution and in two days they would just

927
00:36:55,019 --> 00:36:59,099
see their plants open up and literally

928
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:01,140
kind of they would call it explode and

929
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:03,300
like I said their buds just started

930
00:37:01,139 --> 00:37:05,819
really growing and it took me a while to

931
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:07,140
think through this but I think the I

932
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:08,820
think the truth is that there's a

933
00:37:07,139 --> 00:37:11,279
lockout that's occurring that microbes

934
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:13,079
completely get rid of and allow the

935
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,060
plants just to focus on uptaking

936
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:18,240
nutrients and allocating them without

937
00:37:15,059 --> 00:37:22,139
any kind of stutter

938
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:23,939
hmm so your your theory your hypothesis

939
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:27,659
around this is that

940
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:29,039
even in a relatively sterile system and

941
00:37:27,659 --> 00:37:30,899
we say sterile but there's no grow

942
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:33,119
that's actually sterile

943
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:35,400
um right but in a system with less

944
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:38,099
microbes that's not using soil using a

945
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:39,300
media like rock wool and mineral salts

946
00:37:38,099 --> 00:37:42,359
um

947
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:44,160
there's still room for

948
00:37:42,358 --> 00:37:46,739
a micro you know clean microbial

949
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:48,118
products that that could potentially

950
00:37:46,739 --> 00:37:49,439
increase yield or have other plant

951
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:52,559
benefits

952
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:56,039
totally and I I've seen it

953
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:57,779
I I get it I don't know that I fully uh

954
00:37:56,039 --> 00:37:59,519
understand the mechanism and action

955
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:01,859
there I'm thinking okay these microbes

956
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:03,599
maybe could help potentially cycle

957
00:38:01,858 --> 00:38:05,819
nutrients then are they surviving or

958
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:08,220
persisting in the rock wool or are they

959
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:10,500
converting nutrients into a form that

960
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:14,159
allows that addresses some other plant

961
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:16,559
need are they occupying niches on the

962
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:20,940
plant roots themselves like

963
00:38:16,559 --> 00:38:22,858
what's what's really going on do we know

964
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:24,900
I don't think we know completely that's

965
00:38:22,858 --> 00:38:27,239
what's kind of interesting about it I

966
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:28,440
would say that in in rockwool in a

967
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:30,358
rockable environment since you brought

968
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:32,460
that up you know the rhizosphere in

969
00:38:30,358 --> 00:38:35,578
Roots create a very habitable

970
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:39,179
environment you know it's a sticky uh

971
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:42,000
nice carbon uh foundation and it's

972
00:38:39,179 --> 00:38:43,199
exuding carbon into that rock wool the

973
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,599
plants are just doing that so the

974
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:47,819
microbes can live on the roots and and

975
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:50,280
be very happy quite honestly no matter

976
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:52,859
what the substrate is and you'll find as

977
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:56,040
even in soil the microbial concentration

978
00:38:52,858 --> 00:38:58,019
gets greater uh the closer to the roots

979
00:38:56,039 --> 00:39:00,179
or on the roots and so that's the hot

980
00:38:58,019 --> 00:39:03,599
spot that the microbes like to be in

981
00:39:00,179 --> 00:39:05,338
and a lot of uh like microbial science

982
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:07,980
is still a little bit nascent it's hard

983
00:39:05,338 --> 00:39:10,619
to measure all of the idiosyncrasies and

984
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:12,059
interactions that occur yeah but I think

985
00:39:10,619 --> 00:39:13,800
part of that turnover that you

986
00:39:12,059 --> 00:39:15,838
referenced earlier where the microbes

987
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:18,359
are going to die the organized these

988
00:39:15,838 --> 00:39:21,119
cells break open and the constituents of

989
00:39:18,358 --> 00:39:23,400
those cells create a bio food source

990
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:25,740
that stimulate the plants and the plants

991
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:28,320
are able to take that up also there's a

992
00:39:25,739 --> 00:39:31,858
lot of simple proteins the plants can

993
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:34,019
take up that way and ultimately uh what

994
00:39:31,858 --> 00:39:35,880
I've seen is I think the plants just get

995
00:39:34,019 --> 00:39:38,659
more nourished or they are able to get

996
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:41,640
more resources with that extra Catalyst

997
00:39:38,659 --> 00:39:42,598
somehow obviously we understand nutrient

998
00:39:41,639 --> 00:39:44,639
cycling

999
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:46,619
there are some other mechanisms

1000
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:48,598
biological mechanisms that are obviously

1001
00:39:46,619 --> 00:39:50,940
occurring in a more synthetic

1002
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:53,700
environment and more of a rockwool

1003
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:55,380
substrate where the nutrients are being

1004
00:39:53,699 --> 00:39:57,239
fed and we think that they're all

1005
00:39:55,380 --> 00:40:00,838
soluble so the plants seem to be taking

1006
00:39:57,239 --> 00:40:02,639
them up but I think plants in some cases

1007
00:40:00,838 --> 00:40:05,639
are able to take up more nutrients and

1008
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:07,199
so they're able to allocate more and uh

1009
00:40:05,639 --> 00:40:10,259
One Last Detail that I think is

1010
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:11,399
fascinating I've seen just uh numerous

1011
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:14,940
times

1012
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:17,700
and said rockwool bro and you can have a

1013
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:21,420
synthetic fertilizer and a synthetic

1014
00:40:17,699 --> 00:40:25,019
fertilizer treatment with microbes and

1015
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:27,119
the plants both look good but they're

1016
00:40:25,019 --> 00:40:29,280
actually not the same and I've noticed

1017
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:31,760
in many cases the smell the terpene

1018
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:34,440
profile and even resin profiles

1019
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:37,440
anecdotally and quantifiably

1020
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:39,900
are much higher and a lot of the

1021
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:43,320
microbial treatments than just a plain

1022
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:45,358
synthetic and you can even tell by the

1023
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:47,640
smell and going through enough smell

1024
00:40:45,358 --> 00:40:50,219
plants that look similar but one smell

1025
00:40:47,639 --> 00:40:52,440
like hay or cut grass and one smelled

1026
00:40:50,219 --> 00:40:55,379
more like a really interesting cannabis

1027
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:57,838
strain and it was sticky and the only

1028
00:40:55,380 --> 00:41:00,059
difference was microbes so I think that

1029
00:40:57,838 --> 00:41:03,119
the microbes are not only able to

1030
00:41:00,059 --> 00:41:06,059
deliver more resources to the plant but

1031
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:09,599
they might also trigger some type of

1032
00:41:06,059 --> 00:41:13,440
signaling that allows the plant to turn

1033
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:15,720
on some of these genes that produce more

1034
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:18,599
cannabinoids maybe produce more terpenes

1035
00:41:15,719 --> 00:41:20,279
produce more resins

1036
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:21,838
yeah I mean we know now that some of

1037
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:24,660
these microbes are actually going into

1038
00:41:21,838 --> 00:41:27,420
the root tip itself into the plant and

1039
00:41:24,659 --> 00:41:28,858
then back out again it's pretty it's

1040
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:30,720
pretty incredible the stuff we're

1041
00:41:28,858 --> 00:41:33,480
learning

1042
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:36,179
um so one thing I've been thinking about

1043
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:38,280
lately because we're talking about sort

1044
00:41:36,179 --> 00:41:41,819
of

1045
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:44,760
how you know how do we apply microbes or

1046
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:46,559
how do we look at soils and and

1047
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:50,040
diversity

1048
00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:51,539
and there's a so I this is not a

1049
00:41:50,039 --> 00:41:53,159
complete thought so bear with me on this

1050
00:41:51,539 --> 00:41:54,599
the first thing the first part of this

1051
00:41:53,159 --> 00:41:56,219
that I want to share that goes into this

1052
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:57,420
thought process is when I make compost

1053
00:41:56,219 --> 00:41:59,039
tea

1054
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:00,659
um I'm going for nutrient cycling right

1055
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:02,460
well when I look at it on the microscope

1056
00:42:00,659 --> 00:42:05,338
if I brew for

1057
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:07,139
let's say more than 60 hours at the end

1058
00:42:05,338 --> 00:42:09,059
of the day I don't have that level of

1059
00:42:07,139 --> 00:42:11,338
diversity anymore pretty much what I'm

1060
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:14,820
down to is just like one morphology of

1061
00:42:11,338 --> 00:42:17,820
bacteria and one morphology of uh

1062
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:19,800
typically of some sort of flagellate uh

1063
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:21,900
it's like and I give the analogy like

1064
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:23,039
what if I just took a zoo and put out

1065
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:24,900
all this food and opened up all the

1066
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:27,599
gates you know at first there'd be this

1067
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:29,160
explosion of growth and then you'd come

1068
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:30,838
back a week later and you just have like

1069
00:42:29,159 --> 00:42:32,759
your lions and your rats your apex

1070
00:42:30,838 --> 00:42:35,400
predator and your best you know

1071
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:38,280
survivalist and and they'll fluctuate so

1072
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:39,480
the bacteria will explode and then all

1073
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:41,280
of a sudden you know I'll come back

1074
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,539
eight hours later and it'll just be all

1075
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,460
flagellants because they will have eaten

1076
00:42:42,539 --> 00:42:46,079
all the bacteria and then they no longer

1077
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:47,820
have food so they die off and then the

1078
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:49,920
bacteria explodes again and you get this

1079
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:53,539
like roller coaster but you've lost all

1080
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:56,480
your diversity and so when I think about

1081
00:42:53,539 --> 00:43:00,659
no-till you can see where I'm going here

1082
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:02,219
and this idea that uh my good friend Ben

1083
00:43:00,659 --> 00:43:05,098
Higgins explained to me talking about

1084
00:43:02,219 --> 00:43:07,559
the disturbance hypothesis which is this

1085
00:43:05,099 --> 00:43:08,280
idea that when we have

1086
00:43:07,559 --> 00:43:11,279
um

1087
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:13,319
you know a new land that has you know

1088
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:15,780
let's just say a volcano

1089
00:43:13,318 --> 00:43:18,420
lava forms this land there's no life on

1090
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:20,339
it right we'll get we'll slowly start to

1091
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:22,680
see species get introduced but the

1092
00:43:20,338 --> 00:43:25,500
diversity on that you know

1093
00:43:22,679 --> 00:43:27,739
on that rock is is minimal

1094
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:30,539
well over time that diversity increases

1095
00:43:27,739 --> 00:43:33,439
and we'll start to you know we'll start

1096
00:43:30,539 --> 00:43:36,599
to see grasslands and then forests and

1097
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:38,338
soil will obviously develop and then

1098
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:41,180
eventually we'll end up in what we you

1099
00:43:38,338 --> 00:43:44,338
know was known as like a climax

1100
00:43:41,179 --> 00:43:46,559
ecological niche something like uh yeah

1101
00:43:44,338 --> 00:43:48,420
old growth forest and the diversity

1102
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:51,179
declines at that point

1103
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:53,159
so somewhere in the middle there is

1104
00:43:51,179 --> 00:43:55,799
where we have our maximum level of

1105
00:43:53,159 --> 00:43:57,239
diversity it's not at the end in the old

1106
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:59,700
growth forest it's not at the beginning

1107
00:43:57,239 --> 00:44:02,759
you know where we just have bare rock

1108
00:43:59,699 --> 00:44:05,699
it's somewhere in the middle and so

1109
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:07,859
this is one of the one of the reasons

1110
00:44:05,699 --> 00:44:09,419
like in my brain I think okay maybe a

1111
00:44:07,858 --> 00:44:11,880
little bit of soil disturbance is okay

1112
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:14,159
maybe it's good so when we go to reamend

1113
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:15,720
our living soil beds you know we're not

1114
00:44:14,159 --> 00:44:17,578
we're not get breaking out of mechanical

1115
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:20,939
tiller and just destroying all soil

1116
00:44:17,579 --> 00:44:23,280
structure but we are mixing in nutrients

1117
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:26,940
for the next cycle

1118
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:28,800
is that really as harmful as like people

1119
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:29,579
might make it out to be

1120
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,500
um

1121
00:44:29,579 --> 00:44:33,720
I think I've already kind of shared my

1122
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:35,940
opinion through my explanation but what

1123
00:44:33,719 --> 00:44:38,519
are your thoughts around it

1124
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:41,579
yeah well well I'm kind of hearing this

1125
00:44:38,519 --> 00:44:43,259
session here which is a really fun idea

1126
00:44:41,579 --> 00:44:45,599
we used to do this in my college class

1127
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:48,839
I've grown fungi soil fungi for years

1128
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:51,180
yeah uh and as a desert ecologist sponge

1129
00:44:48,838 --> 00:44:53,880
I really dominate the function of those

1130
00:44:51,179 --> 00:44:55,500
soils because of their uh not only the

1131
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:57,480
morphology but their physiology and

1132
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:59,460
they're able to withstand and you can

1133
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:01,019
see that at a microbial scale you can

1134
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:02,338
see this on this Forest scale that

1135
00:45:01,019 --> 00:45:04,858
you're talking about in this kind of

1136
00:45:02,338 --> 00:45:06,779
peak of diversity before it starts to

1137
00:45:04,858 --> 00:45:09,420
dwindle I've always thought of

1138
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:11,880
Agriculture as an inherent inherently

1139
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:14,039
Disturbed system like I don't think

1140
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:17,940
there's any kind of stasis or secession

1141
00:45:14,039 --> 00:45:22,318
or this natural environment slowly

1142
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:24,920
the biology and that slowly evolves

1143
00:45:22,318 --> 00:45:28,019
in succession so you have this just

1144
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:31,019
climax type of community it's not going

1145
00:45:28,019 --> 00:45:33,960
to be that way and so I think that in uh

1146
00:45:31,019 --> 00:45:36,239
in agriculture

1147
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:38,039
it's a balance I think it's what

1148
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:40,019
whatever you're trying to accomplish is

1149
00:45:38,039 --> 00:45:43,139
really important I I would say that

1150
00:45:40,019 --> 00:45:45,059
fungi get more Disturbed than bacteria

1151
00:45:43,139 --> 00:45:48,239
just because of the structure that they

1152
00:45:45,059 --> 00:45:51,719
form and so if you have uh just in

1153
00:45:48,239 --> 00:45:54,118
really intricate involved uh established

1154
00:45:51,719 --> 00:45:55,980
fungal mats and you break that apart

1155
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:57,480
that's going to disturb the

1156
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:59,940
functionality of those fun times that's

1157
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:02,940
not necessarily the case in in our

1158
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:04,019
systems bacteria are a lot more

1159
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:06,240
forgiving

1160
00:46:04,019 --> 00:46:08,338
through disturbance because their size

1161
00:46:06,239 --> 00:46:12,000
allows them not to feel the disturbance

1162
00:46:08,338 --> 00:46:12,838
like a uh like a larger organisms might

1163
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,318
be

1164
00:46:12,838 --> 00:46:18,539
you think about farmlands where the

1165
00:46:16,318 --> 00:46:21,239
tilling versus no-tilling has been

1166
00:46:18,539 --> 00:46:23,338
argued and I think that you know there's

1167
00:46:21,239 --> 00:46:24,838
a practical balance where you'll see a

1168
00:46:23,338 --> 00:46:28,199
lot of farms where they have strips of

1169
00:46:24,838 --> 00:46:29,940
grass in between every other row and

1170
00:46:28,199 --> 00:46:32,279
that's the nurture of the mycorrhizae

1171
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:34,800
and the fungi in the soil where there's

1172
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:38,240
at least a presence of undisturbed fungi

1173
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:42,900
that can help influence the plant growth

1174
00:46:38,239 --> 00:46:45,118
every year as they're planting out so

1175
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:47,519
I think it's a really hard target to

1176
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:49,559
think you're not going to disturb uh

1177
00:46:47,519 --> 00:46:50,579
Disturbed soils or work with disturb

1178
00:46:49,559 --> 00:46:53,699
soils

1179
00:46:50,579 --> 00:46:55,980
in in any type of Agriculture and I

1180
00:46:53,699 --> 00:46:58,559
think it's important to understand if

1181
00:46:55,980 --> 00:47:01,619
you're using biology to understand how

1182
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:02,880
resilient that biology is uh that you're

1183
00:47:01,619 --> 00:47:04,318
that you're working with in that

1184
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:07,740
particular environment

1185
00:47:04,318 --> 00:47:09,239
so not all microbes would do well you if

1186
00:47:07,739 --> 00:47:10,858
you're collecting to go back to your

1187
00:47:09,239 --> 00:47:13,279
example if you're working with tea and

1188
00:47:10,858 --> 00:47:16,380
you're taking uh samples from nature

1189
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:20,040
well those natural samples a lot of that

1190
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:22,500
biology hasn't evolved through love that

1191
00:47:20,039 --> 00:47:25,019
tea environment and so the environment

1192
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:27,599
selects in biology it's almost like

1193
00:47:25,019 --> 00:47:29,219
basically a law the environment selects

1194
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:31,680
and so you created a different

1195
00:47:29,219 --> 00:47:34,919
environment and now the biology is

1196
00:47:31,679 --> 00:47:37,379
working through that environment and you

1197
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:39,960
talk about having the morphology of rods

1198
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:41,940
but I'd argue also that there's probably

1199
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:43,920
a lot of diversities because it's one

1200
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:45,900
morphological group there's a lot of

1201
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:48,838
different species and genus that

1202
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:50,400
represent bacillus Rod shaped they could

1203
00:47:48,838 --> 00:47:52,139
be Grant positive they could be gram

1204
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,880
negative I don't know if you did those

1205
00:47:52,139 --> 00:47:56,400
gram staining so there could be a lot of

1206
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:57,660
diversity but you wiped out the microbes

1207
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,579
that couldn't persist in that

1208
00:47:57,659 --> 00:48:01,259
environment and so now you're just

1209
00:47:59,579 --> 00:48:03,839
forced to work with the microbes that

1210
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:05,880
that will work for you in your tea

1211
00:48:03,838 --> 00:48:07,739
environment that will work for your for

1212
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:10,079
your you know for your farm

1213
00:48:07,739 --> 00:48:12,059
yeah just qualitatively under the

1214
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:14,280
microscope you see a massive drop in

1215
00:48:12,059 --> 00:48:15,659
diversity over time which is got me

1216
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:18,420
thinking about the whole disturbance

1217
00:48:15,659 --> 00:48:21,598
thing but one of the things that

1218
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:23,940
um agronomist Lee Brice I had him on the

1219
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:25,440
podcast he's he's he just he turned to

1220
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:27,780
me and he goes Tad

1221
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:30,059
agriculture is not a natural system it's

1222
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:32,339
not natural right and I I have to remind

1223
00:48:30,059 --> 00:48:33,960
myself of that because people always say

1224
00:48:32,338 --> 00:48:35,759
you know Go Back To Nature do what

1225
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:39,480
nature does well nature doesn't do this

1226
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:42,599
it doesn't select for one you know one

1227
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:45,119
species or one variety plant over at the

1228
00:48:42,599 --> 00:48:47,818
exclusion of all else and

1229
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:50,099
so the amount of diversity in a forest

1230
00:48:47,818 --> 00:48:52,500
versus what we see on a microbial level

1231
00:48:50,099 --> 00:48:55,740
in agricultural lands is quite quite

1232
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:57,960
drastically different and totally

1233
00:48:55,739 --> 00:49:01,259
um I I think we have to remember too

1234
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:03,539
like in in an agricultural system every

1235
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:05,760
time we Harvest a plant we're removing

1236
00:49:03,539 --> 00:49:07,920
biomass removing organic matter we're

1237
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:10,380
removing nutrients and those have to be

1238
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:12,599
replaced and if we can manage that

1239
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:15,358
replacement to keep us at a level of

1240
00:49:12,599 --> 00:49:16,680
stasis that's optimal for you know cycle

1241
00:49:15,358 --> 00:49:18,358
after cycle that's really what we're

1242
00:49:16,679 --> 00:49:19,799
going for with soil testing and things

1243
00:49:18,358 --> 00:49:20,818
like that

1244
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:23,280
um

1245
00:49:20,818 --> 00:49:24,960
so I I find it all all really

1246
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,880
interesting and fascinating but I don't

1247
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:28,920
get as worried about disturbance and

1248
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:30,599
some more recent things that have got me

1249
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:32,700
thinking about this and and again I'm

1250
00:49:30,599 --> 00:49:34,318
talking about indoor beds or pots I'm

1251
00:49:32,699 --> 00:49:36,838
not talking about yeah

1252
00:49:34,318 --> 00:49:38,940
uh tilling outdoor land I think there's

1253
00:49:36,838 --> 00:49:41,759
a lot of reasons not to tell for erosion

1254
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:43,260
and other you know disturbance issues

1255
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:45,839
but if we're talking about in indoor

1256
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:48,839
beds you know hand tilling or hand

1257
00:49:45,838 --> 00:49:51,659
disturbing um

1258
00:49:48,838 --> 00:49:54,239
we know now that heavy metals tend to

1259
00:49:51,659 --> 00:49:55,259
accumulate in the roots and the stems of

1260
00:49:54,239 --> 00:49:56,879
the plants more than buds there's

1261
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:58,980
research to support that so if we can

1262
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:00,780
remove those things we're lowering the

1263
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:02,519
amount of heavy metals in our bed which

1264
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:04,740
is a good thing especially in states

1265
00:50:02,519 --> 00:50:07,440
where you're regulated uh from the

1266
00:50:04,739 --> 00:50:10,618
presentation in the research by Dr punja

1267
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:12,838
we know that uh this viroid is going to

1268
00:50:10,619 --> 00:50:14,338
be more accumulative in the roots of the

1269
00:50:12,838 --> 00:50:16,440
plant so if we take those roots out

1270
00:50:14,338 --> 00:50:20,338
we'll be removing some of that that

1271
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:22,679
Viral viral load so I

1272
00:50:20,338 --> 00:50:24,358
at this point and maybe someone will

1273
00:50:22,679 --> 00:50:25,858
convince me of something differently

1274
00:50:24,358 --> 00:50:27,539
um I'm inclined to remove as much of

1275
00:50:25,858 --> 00:50:29,400
that as we can

1276
00:50:27,539 --> 00:50:32,219
um so

1277
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:33,780
I just I think it's all very fascinating

1278
00:50:32,219 --> 00:50:35,279
um do you think we'll ever fully

1279
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:37,200
understand

1280
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:39,839
all of this

1281
00:50:37,199 --> 00:50:41,879
um because it is so complex

1282
00:50:39,838 --> 00:50:44,219
listen I don't think we'll ever fully

1283
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:46,800
understand even the human body and it

1284
00:50:44,219 --> 00:50:48,719
has an orders of magnitude more research

1285
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:51,900
funding uh thrown at it than

1286
00:50:48,719 --> 00:50:54,179
microbiology to be fair and so I think

1287
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:55,559
we'll continue to learn more and I think

1288
00:50:54,179 --> 00:50:57,000
20 years from now we're going to look

1289
00:50:55,559 --> 00:50:59,460
back and we're going to say now we

1290
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:02,519
didn't understand that at all and that

1291
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:04,980
just like viruses you know we've learned

1292
00:51:02,519 --> 00:51:07,380
more about viruses and thyroids than we

1293
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:08,579
ever have before and we know about this

1294
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:11,640
much about them

1295
00:51:08,579 --> 00:51:13,619
the techniques and methods and the way

1296
00:51:11,639 --> 00:51:15,299
uh the way they just function although

1297
00:51:13,619 --> 00:51:17,338
you know coronavirus has helped with

1298
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:20,160
that with the research and funding to

1299
00:51:17,338 --> 00:51:22,199
understand that we it's like a drop in

1300
00:51:20,159 --> 00:51:24,598
the ocean on what I think we know about

1301
00:51:22,199 --> 00:51:26,399
these smaller life forms for a couple

1302
00:51:24,599 --> 00:51:30,240
different reasons and we're just it's

1303
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:32,760
still pretty nascent although it's a

1304
00:51:30,239 --> 00:51:35,639
it's amazing what we've learned over the

1305
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:37,079
last let's say 15 years I remember the

1306
00:51:35,639 --> 00:51:39,480
first time I went to a school of ecology

1307
00:51:37,079 --> 00:51:41,519
conference and they decided to open up

1308
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:44,099
the black box of soil and agriculture

1309
00:51:41,519 --> 00:51:46,619
was considered soil a black box just a

1310
00:51:44,099 --> 00:51:47,760
constant that's how it treated soil and

1311
00:51:46,619 --> 00:51:49,079
it said we're actually going to look

1312
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:51,660
inside and we're going to start

1313
00:51:49,079 --> 00:51:55,619
understanding the biology and that was

1314
00:51:51,659 --> 00:51:58,259
in the 90s and that's when kind of micro

1315
00:51:55,619 --> 00:51:59,640
wheel ecology started as far as I'm

1316
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:03,059
concerned there was a lot of work done

1317
00:51:59,639 --> 00:52:04,679
before but it was very early and uh and

1318
00:52:03,059 --> 00:52:07,319
so yeah we still have a lot of fun stuff

1319
00:52:04,679 --> 00:52:09,239
to learn on this

1320
00:52:07,318 --> 00:52:13,400
yeah when we talk about the history of

1321
00:52:09,239 --> 00:52:17,219
Agriculture I think one of the reasons

1322
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:19,220
we've been successful is like you you

1323
00:52:17,219 --> 00:52:21,618
mentioned the pH is the one of the main

1324
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:23,719
variables in terms of influencing

1325
00:52:21,619 --> 00:52:26,660
microbial growth

1326
00:52:23,719 --> 00:52:29,159
and what microbes are successful well

1327
00:52:26,659 --> 00:52:32,578
that's where I think the soil testing

1328
00:52:29,159 --> 00:52:34,019
really was was important because I hear

1329
00:52:32,579 --> 00:52:35,220
people talk about like you know I'm an

1330
00:52:34,019 --> 00:52:37,980
organic grower I don't need a pH

1331
00:52:35,219 --> 00:52:40,318
anything and yes soil has amazing

1332
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:41,699
buffering capacities but this idea that

1333
00:52:40,318 --> 00:52:43,558
you know

1334
00:52:41,699 --> 00:52:46,799
Farmers for years have been targeting

1335
00:52:43,559 --> 00:52:48,900
you know very specific pH ranges which

1336
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:51,240
are not beneficial for plant uptake but

1337
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:52,800
also beneficial for these microbes I

1338
00:52:51,239 --> 00:52:54,179
think maybe we were inadvertently

1339
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:57,119
getting benefits that we weren't even

1340
00:52:54,179 --> 00:53:00,058
aware of on a microbial level and and

1341
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:02,900
also why we why I believe soil testing

1342
00:53:00,059 --> 00:53:05,819
is so important when we're talking about

1343
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:07,500
reamending and managing

1344
00:53:05,818 --> 00:53:09,960
you know a grow

1345
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:12,539
so you know you're kind of talking about

1346
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:16,139
I think about confidence and I think

1347
00:53:12,539 --> 00:53:18,659
consistency is key uh consistent inputs

1348
00:53:16,139 --> 00:53:21,420
or consistent practices ultimately yield

1349
00:53:18,659 --> 00:53:24,179
consistent results and consistency can

1350
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:25,920
be a predictable range and especially

1351
00:53:24,179 --> 00:53:29,098
when we're talking about microbiology or

1352
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:31,079
organic growing or living beds it's not

1353
00:53:29,099 --> 00:53:32,818
going to be consistent but I think that

1354
00:53:31,079 --> 00:53:36,359
what we want to do ultimately is predict

1355
00:53:32,818 --> 00:53:38,400
the range of confidence so we know the

1356
00:53:36,358 --> 00:53:41,699
ups and downs so to speak of what to

1357
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:43,500
expect from functionality and and uh

1358
00:53:41,699 --> 00:53:45,358
just all the constituents of the soil

1359
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:47,219
and then like you're talking about you

1360
00:53:45,358 --> 00:53:50,098
can manage that as long as you can

1361
00:53:47,219 --> 00:53:52,739
measure it you can manage it to think

1362
00:53:50,099 --> 00:53:55,500
it's static that's just not realistic in

1363
00:53:52,739 --> 00:53:57,019
in life at all especially with when

1364
00:53:55,500 --> 00:54:00,900
you're dealing with Biology

1365
00:53:57,019 --> 00:54:03,300
so that that's exactly right

1366
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:06,079
so rather than what you're saying there

1367
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:09,180
is what we're targeting is a range with

1368
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:10,559
soils in terms of outcomes too yeah it's

1369
00:54:09,179 --> 00:54:12,539
not I think that's that's the way to

1370
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:14,760
manage it yeah it's not just this finite

1371
00:54:12,539 --> 00:54:16,558
number it's a range of numbers but you

1372
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:18,839
can control that it doesn't mean that

1373
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:21,720
it's it's bad we just have to let go of

1374
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:23,880
a little bit of our our control in these

1375
00:54:21,719 --> 00:54:26,098
systems absolutely listen I used to do a

1376
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:28,740
lot of natural studies in grasslands and

1377
00:54:26,099 --> 00:54:30,720
whatnot and I used to do annual studies

1378
00:54:28,739 --> 00:54:33,000
where I would do quarterly and seasonal

1379
00:54:30,719 --> 00:54:35,219
I'd go out and take samples and look at

1380
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:37,818
the Rises for microbes and look at how

1381
00:54:35,219 --> 00:54:41,759
the the population or the community

1382
00:54:37,818 --> 00:54:44,639
diversity change and it changes every

1383
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:46,619
season depending on the conditions and a

1384
00:54:44,639 --> 00:54:49,379
lot of that although the soil was well

1385
00:54:46,619 --> 00:54:51,240
buffered as far as pH the plants had a

1386
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:53,338
large influence and then the temperature

1387
00:54:51,239 --> 00:54:55,019
had a large influence and sometimes you

1388
00:54:53,338 --> 00:54:57,659
know the hydrology had an influence

1389
00:54:55,019 --> 00:55:00,539
there also where I could see a dramatic

1390
00:54:57,659 --> 00:55:03,598
shift in microbial Community assemblage

1391
00:55:00,539 --> 00:55:06,300
and populations or concentrations across

1392
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:09,300
the growing season across four across

1393
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:11,818
across 12 months or four seasons and

1394
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:14,220
then it would come back and so my

1395
00:55:11,818 --> 00:55:17,099
predictable range was that annual cycle

1396
00:55:14,219 --> 00:55:18,719
where I could pretty much predict what

1397
00:55:17,099 --> 00:55:20,760
the microbes were going to be doing on a

1398
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:22,318
seasonal level based on three or four

1399
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:25,200
different parameters

1400
00:55:22,318 --> 00:55:26,639
so you can if you take a far enough step

1401
00:55:25,199 --> 00:55:28,799
back

1402
00:55:26,639 --> 00:55:33,299
you get that consistency or you're using

1403
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:35,099
yeah right yeah totally exactly yeah so

1404
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:36,720
I'm looking at my notes I know we're

1405
00:55:35,099 --> 00:55:38,338
running out of time there's one question

1406
00:55:36,719 --> 00:55:40,439
I didn't really get to ask you that I

1407
00:55:38,338 --> 00:55:42,779
wanted to that kind of fits into what

1408
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:43,318
we're talking about here is

1409
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:45,180
um

1410
00:55:43,318 --> 00:55:47,159
from my interview with Dr Michael

1411
00:55:45,179 --> 00:55:48,358
brownbridge one of the things he

1412
00:55:47,159 --> 00:55:50,519
mentioned was like I don't he doesn't

1413
00:55:48,358 --> 00:55:53,039
understand why there's so many products

1414
00:55:50,519 --> 00:55:55,019
in some of these uh you know

1415
00:55:53,039 --> 00:55:57,719
biostimulants or micro products on the

1416
00:55:55,019 --> 00:55:58,980
market you know there's a huge list of

1417
00:55:57,719 --> 00:56:00,439
microbes of what they're putting in

1418
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:02,880
there

1419
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:05,400
knowing that a lot of these May occupy

1420
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:08,160
the same ecological niches or compete

1421
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:09,480
for the same space and and like you said

1422
00:56:08,159 --> 00:56:11,818
knowing that these microbes are

1423
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:13,800
constantly changing in in the in the

1424
00:56:11,818 --> 00:56:15,838
environment like do we want a more

1425
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:18,000
targeted approach where we have one

1426
00:56:15,838 --> 00:56:22,199
microbe or us you know like mycorrhizal

1427
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:24,780
fungus or trichoderma or or Bavaria or

1428
00:56:22,199 --> 00:56:27,838
do we want a Consortium of microbes in

1429
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:29,640
our microbial product or do we want

1430
00:56:27,838 --> 00:56:33,000
um

1431
00:56:29,639 --> 00:56:35,519
I I get I guess do we need is it a waste

1432
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:37,559
of money to be buying ones that have all

1433
00:56:35,519 --> 00:56:38,940
of these these in there when we could

1434
00:56:37,559 --> 00:56:40,500
just be a little more targeted about it

1435
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:43,019
I guess

1436
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:46,199
yeah you know I'm not so sure that cost

1437
00:56:43,019 --> 00:56:48,239
is is uh associated with the different

1438
00:56:46,199 --> 00:56:50,159
concentrations or the different formulas

1439
00:56:48,239 --> 00:56:52,500
of microbes okay

1440
00:56:50,159 --> 00:56:54,779
um I would say that

1441
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:57,119
in general

1442
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:59,099
it kind of just depends on the

1443
00:56:57,119 --> 00:57:00,838
confidence you have in that product and

1444
00:56:59,099 --> 00:57:03,180
what you think it's it's going to do

1445
00:57:00,838 --> 00:57:06,119
I've seen companies just throw

1446
00:57:03,179 --> 00:57:07,799
everything in the kitchen sink uh add a

1447
00:57:06,119 --> 00:57:09,180
product and just have everything in

1448
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:12,500
there because that was their marketing

1449
00:57:09,179 --> 00:57:15,419
strategy I'm not so sure how much actual

1450
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:16,980
scientific validation they had for the

1451
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:18,240
formula rather than just throwing

1452
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:20,280
everything in there and saying hey

1453
00:57:18,239 --> 00:57:21,838
everything's in there I think that it

1454
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:25,800
does provide for some functional

1455
00:57:21,838 --> 00:57:28,380
redundancy if you have more species I am

1456
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:31,559
a proponent of a consortia effect but I

1457
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:34,140
would say uh responsible or a well

1458
00:57:31,559 --> 00:57:36,240
thought out consortia effect that's that

1459
00:57:34,139 --> 00:57:37,980
was the thought behind uh Mammoth

1460
00:57:36,239 --> 00:57:40,318
microbes or Mammoth p

1461
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:42,539
that's also the thought behind the

1462
00:57:40,318 --> 00:57:45,480
microbial Mass technology you know you

1463
00:57:42,539 --> 00:57:48,119
have microbes you know what the microbes

1464
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:49,679
are your promise is those microbial

1465
00:57:48,119 --> 00:57:51,960
concentrations and what they're doing

1466
00:57:49,679 --> 00:57:53,460
for your plant and I think that's a

1467
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:57,119
really good approach when you start

1468
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:59,338
seeing a large assortment of microbes I

1469
00:57:57,119 --> 00:58:01,680
think I really question the consistency

1470
00:57:59,338 --> 00:58:05,460
and I would I would suggest that it's

1471
00:58:01,679 --> 00:58:07,679
really hard to to manufacture uh with uh

1472
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:10,199
with consistency a really large

1473
00:58:07,679 --> 00:58:11,578
consortia and maintain that in the

1474
00:58:10,199 --> 00:58:14,039
bottle over time

1475
00:58:11,579 --> 00:58:16,440
I'm not so sure it's bad or good I would

1476
00:58:14,039 --> 00:58:18,318
say that it's it's less defined and more

1477
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:20,700
I would consider them much more General

1478
00:58:18,318 --> 00:58:23,639
Solutions just to help with nutrient

1479
00:58:20,699 --> 00:58:26,039
cycling and I would say that more of the

1480
00:58:23,639 --> 00:58:28,679
functionally targeted consortions are

1481
00:58:26,039 --> 00:58:31,019
are a very interesting approach because

1482
00:58:28,679 --> 00:58:33,118
there's typically a lot of thought

1483
00:58:31,019 --> 00:58:34,920
put behind not only the function of the

1484
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:36,539
micro but the redundancy of the microbe

1485
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:38,579
and the environmental resilience of

1486
00:58:36,539 --> 00:58:40,318
those microbes and that's why I'm seeing

1487
00:58:38,579 --> 00:58:44,420
the products that have a limited

1488
00:58:40,318 --> 00:58:44,420
Consortium there's a purpose for them

1489
00:58:44,639 --> 00:58:49,139
that's I think that's a good point and

1490
00:58:46,818 --> 00:58:51,000
one thing that I think that you and I

1491
00:58:49,139 --> 00:58:52,500
just kind of take for granted um and

1492
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:55,260
that I hope other people will start

1493
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:58,260
doing another and many people do is just

1494
00:58:55,260 --> 00:59:00,480
set up a trial like um have a control

1495
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:03,540
test to see if this product in your

1496
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:04,740
environment gives you an effect

1497
00:59:03,539 --> 00:59:06,779
um and you may be surprised by the

1498
00:59:04,739 --> 00:59:08,338
results like I for example was surprised

1499
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:09,240
by the mammoth P results we got a gold

1500
00:59:08,338 --> 00:59:11,099
leaf

1501
00:59:09,239 --> 00:59:13,379
um I did not think we'd see any sort of

1502
00:59:11,099 --> 00:59:14,940
statistically significant difference in

1503
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:16,200
yield and we did

1504
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:18,240
um because I was like our soil already

1505
00:59:16,199 --> 00:59:20,639
has all this you know good microbial

1506
00:59:18,239 --> 00:59:21,779
activity and and everything so that

1507
00:59:20,639 --> 00:59:22,558
surprised me

1508
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:24,298
um

1509
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:25,740
and I think that's worth revisiting to

1510
00:59:24,298 --> 00:59:27,298
see if we're still getting those bumps

1511
00:59:25,739 --> 00:59:28,618
you know I think this is sort of thing

1512
00:59:27,298 --> 00:59:30,420
is you know people have to do this

1513
00:59:28,619 --> 00:59:31,980
ongoing don't just do one trial but

1514
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:33,358
replicate it

1515
00:59:31,980 --> 00:59:35,880
um and now you know we're setting up a

1516
00:59:33,358 --> 00:59:38,699
trial right now now with the microbial

1517
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:40,200
mass and gold Legion I'm excited to you

1518
00:59:38,699 --> 00:59:42,000
know hopefully get to document and share

1519
00:59:40,199 --> 00:59:44,399
those results

1520
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:47,099
um but uh yeah I think people need to

1521
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:48,539
test it out because I I I feel pretty

1522
00:59:47,099 --> 00:59:50,400
confident saying that there's a lot of

1523
00:59:48,539 --> 00:59:53,460
microbial products on the market that

1524
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:55,200
give micro products a bad name whether

1525
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:57,240
they just you know took a bunch of

1526
00:59:55,199 --> 00:59:58,980
powders out of China that were

1527
00:59:57,239 --> 01:00:00,479
supposedly these concentrations mixed

1528
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:01,858
them all together because they saw a

1529
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:03,358
research paper on it that said that they

1530
01:00:01,858 --> 01:00:05,159
were beneficial

1531
01:00:03,358 --> 01:00:06,838
um you know that stuff's out there and

1532
01:00:05,159 --> 01:00:08,399
some of them are quite popular and

1533
01:00:06,838 --> 01:00:09,960
frankly I don't think people are getting

1534
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:11,400
the results that they they should be

1535
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:12,420
getting for what they're paying for it

1536
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:14,280
so

1537
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:15,960
yeah totally I think that's absolutely

1538
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:18,359
right and that you know you know I mean

1539
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:20,220
that's the approach I've always taken uh

1540
01:00:18,358 --> 01:00:23,519
kind of the scientific approach I like

1541
01:00:20,219 --> 01:00:26,578
bringing validated Innovation into the

1542
01:00:23,519 --> 01:00:28,199
market to help the success of Growers

1543
01:00:26,579 --> 01:00:31,019
that was the whole intention kind of the

1544
01:00:28,199 --> 01:00:32,539
purpose I have professionally and and as

1545
01:00:31,019 --> 01:00:35,780
a scientist to be fair at the University

1546
01:00:32,539 --> 01:00:39,179
and so it's really important to measure

1547
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:40,859
those results and to define success and

1548
01:00:39,179 --> 01:00:42,980
talking with the manufacturers to

1549
01:00:40,858 --> 01:00:45,960
understand what those expectations

1550
01:00:42,980 --> 01:00:47,338
what is the product intended to do and

1551
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:49,858
then you can make sure you can measure

1552
01:00:47,338 --> 01:00:51,420
it to get those results you know if it

1553
01:00:49,858 --> 01:00:54,480
increases yield if it's supposed to

1554
01:00:51,420 --> 01:00:56,940
increase yield is there validating data

1555
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:59,579
that the manufacturers have conducted

1556
01:00:56,940 --> 01:01:02,159
studies that shown that it's increased

1557
01:00:59,579 --> 01:01:03,660
yield and so you can actually start to

1558
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:05,818
have some confidence that you would

1559
01:01:03,659 --> 01:01:08,699
expect that so you can measure it

1560
01:01:05,818 --> 01:01:10,318
same thing for a quality metric I've

1561
01:01:08,699 --> 01:01:12,298
seen products that you know promise

1562
01:01:10,318 --> 01:01:14,519
quality metrics well if you can measure

1563
01:01:12,298 --> 01:01:16,920
it and you have validating data that

1564
01:01:14,519 --> 01:01:19,440
supports that you know let's use the

1565
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:21,000
product for its intention a lot of cases

1566
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:23,099
there's not a real

1567
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:25,318
purpose there's there's not a lot of

1568
01:01:23,099 --> 01:01:27,000
data back products out there and so

1569
01:01:25,318 --> 01:01:28,440
there's not a lot of expectations just

1570
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:31,260
use it you're going to see good results

1571
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:33,780
well okay but it's really hard to

1572
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:35,760
measure that if you can't Define it and

1573
01:01:33,780 --> 01:01:37,079
so on both sides I think the

1574
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:39,200
manufacturer should set clear

1575
01:01:37,079 --> 01:01:41,700
expectations of what the product does

1576
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:43,318
for Growers and The Growers should set

1577
01:01:41,699 --> 01:01:45,298
real expectations of why they're using

1578
01:01:43,318 --> 01:01:47,519
the product and be able to measure that

1579
01:01:45,298 --> 01:01:49,259
and so yielding quality are pretty

1580
01:01:47,519 --> 01:01:51,659
pretty simple things if you think about

1581
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:52,980
early stage cloning products or rooting

1582
01:01:51,659 --> 01:01:55,618
products let's make sure we can measure

1583
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:58,199
root mass and add these products in to

1584
01:01:55,619 --> 01:02:01,858
see more root growth and so I still

1585
01:01:58,199 --> 01:02:04,980
think biology should be uh targeted to a

1586
01:02:01,858 --> 01:02:06,900
specific function a specific outcome why

1587
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:09,358
am I using this I want to measure it and

1588
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:11,099
it should do it just like nutrients and

1589
01:02:09,358 --> 01:02:12,598
everything else you know water does

1590
01:02:11,099 --> 01:02:14,700
something nitrogen does something

1591
01:02:12,599 --> 01:02:17,039
phosphorus does these things that we can

1592
01:02:14,699 --> 01:02:19,259
almost measure if we can't completely

1593
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:21,358
measure we should treat microbes and

1594
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:24,000
microbial Innovations the same exact way

1595
01:02:21,358 --> 01:02:27,078
with rigor

1596
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:30,480
totally agree yeah

1597
01:02:27,079 --> 01:02:32,400
well I I super appreciate you taking the

1598
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:35,460
time to chat with me today and I look

1599
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:36,838
forward to uh you know some of the new

1600
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:38,400
innovation and things that you have

1601
01:02:36,838 --> 01:02:40,920
going on

1602
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:43,500
um and you know following up on this

1603
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:45,900
trial with the microbial Mass product

1604
