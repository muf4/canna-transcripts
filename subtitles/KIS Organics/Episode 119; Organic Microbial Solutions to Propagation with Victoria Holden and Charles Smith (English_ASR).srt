00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:19,679
host Tad Hussey of Kiss Organics this is

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,179
the podcast we discuss The Cutting Edge

6
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:23,339
of growing from a science-based

7
00:00:21,179 --> 00:00:24,719
perspective and drawn top experts from

8
00:00:23,339 --> 00:00:26,939
around the industry to share their

9
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:28,799
wisdom and knowledge my guest this week

10
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:30,980
are Victoria Holden and Charles Smith

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,359
with a short appearance by Ben Higgins

12
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:35,460
Victorian trials are the co-founders of

13
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:37,320
emeo and in this podcast we discuss

14
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,939
their products in research they

15
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,219
currently have brought two products to

16
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:43,920
Market an organic microbial-based

17
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:45,899
rooting powder and gel and a microbial

18
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,600
based solution for breaking down biomass

19
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:50,399
faster which has broad applications

20
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,200
this podcast is over a year in the

21
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,299
making as we wanted to run trials at

22
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,800
Gold Leaf Gardens with Dr Ben Higgins to

23
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:58,198
see how the organic clothing product

24
00:00:55,799 --> 00:01:00,359
worked and get some independent data on

25
00:00:58,198 --> 00:01:02,339
our end there are so many microbial

26
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:03,899
products on the market these days it's

27
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,700
very difficult to separate out the

28
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:07,920
marketing from research and determine

29
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,000
what's worth using in your garden and we

30
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,680
wanted to make sure that all the

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,118
products we offer at kiss Organics or

32
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,520
talk about on the podcast have

33
00:01:12,118 --> 00:01:16,739
legitimate research and value

34
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:18,060
Victoria has a lifelong interest in

35
00:01:16,739 --> 00:01:19,379
studying the interactions between

36
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,478
microbes and their surrounding

37
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:23,459
environment she earned her PhD in

38
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:25,200
microbiology and Immunology from the

39
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:27,179
University of Michigan before moving to

40
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,700
Dartmouth College to further her studies

41
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:32,460
with postdoctoral research as Chief

42
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,960
science officer of imeo Victoria has led

43
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:35,640
the development and Productions of

44
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:37,978
multiple microbial products that replace

45
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:40,859
harmful chemicals and enable healthier

46
00:01:37,978 --> 00:01:43,259
more productive cultivation of plants

47
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:45,299
Charles started emio to dedicate his

48
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:47,459
career to helping people plants and our

49
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:49,380
planet after graduating from Dartmouth

50
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:50,938
College he began his career at Morgan

Finance to join a new york-based

54
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,259
software startup where he gained

55
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:01,380
valuable insight into scaling companies

56
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:03,420

productivity and restore our planet

60
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:11,299
through the power of nature now on to

61
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,300
the show

62
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,219

knowledge here and we're very happy to

68
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:32,818
be part of the conversation

69
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:35,639
yeah so you are co-founders of emio I

70
00:02:32,818 --> 00:02:37,019
met you guys uh through another

71
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:38,339
connection

72
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:41,700
um learning about some of the products

73
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:43,200
that you have and I was uh I came into

74
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:44,759
this sort of a little bit skeptical but

75
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:46,139
through some trials that we ran which

76
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:48,419
we'll talk about in some of the other

77
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:50,098
trials I'm really excited to talk about

78
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:52,139
what you guys have going on in your

79
00:02:50,098 --> 00:02:53,939
company so let's just start off with a

80
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:56,039
little bit of an introduction um Charles

81
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:57,419
can you I know you guys are co-founders

82
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:59,219
can you tell me a little bit about your

83
00:02:57,419 --> 00:03:01,378
role and who you are

84
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:03,598
absolutely and and I just want to say

85
00:03:01,378 --> 00:03:05,159
briefly Ted totally appreciate the

86
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:07,079
skepticism

87
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:08,759
um you know there it's really good to

88
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,560
kind of put put products through their

89
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:12,359
paces and

90
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,340
um you know we we appreciate kind of the

91
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:17,099
data-driven approach that you took to uh

92
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:19,500
getting to know our technology

93
00:03:17,098 --> 00:03:23,158
um in terms of kind of backstory

94
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:24,959
um I'm the co-founder and CEO of amio

95
00:03:23,158 --> 00:03:28,019
um so I lead sort of our our business

96
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:30,539
development and operations Victoria is

97
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:32,640
our chief science officer so she's the

98
00:03:30,539 --> 00:03:35,280
real technical brains behind actually

99
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:40,079
making these products a reality

100
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:41,818
and um the back story on on um emeo

101
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:46,319
um you know started with really wanting

102
00:03:41,818 --> 00:03:49,439
to uh dedicate our careers into doing

103
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:52,560
good things for the planet

104
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:57,060
um and recognizing the huge opportunity

105
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:58,620
that natural microorganisms uh offer in

106
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:01,378
terms of helping plants grow more

107
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:03,599
effectively and also recapturing

108
00:04:01,378 --> 00:04:05,818
valuable nutrients from things that are

109
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:08,339
otherwise treated as waste

110
00:04:05,818 --> 00:04:09,899
wonderful and Victoria can you tell me a

111
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:13,140
little bit about about yourself as well

112
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:16,620
yeah absolutely so I'm a microbiologist

113
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:18,959
I earned my PhD in microbiology from the

114
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:20,939
University of Michigan I've done a lot

115
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,519
of research studying how microbes

116
00:04:20,939 --> 00:04:25,500
interact with their environment for a

117
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:27,779
part of my career that was within the

118
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,819
human body and then I made this

119
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:32,638
transition into wanting to understand

120
00:04:29,819 --> 00:04:35,040
more about how microbes interact in our

121
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,840
natural environment and in the world so

122
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,139
I was really fortunate to meet Charles

123
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:42,839
at a at a good time in my career when I

124
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:45,840
was ready to transition into doing

125
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:48,359
something that could really help the

126
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:51,959
Earth in a more immediate timeline than

127
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:54,360
compared to say academic research and

128
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:56,159
very happy to be

129
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:59,879
helping to lead the scientific

130
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:02,520
development and and production of India

131
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:05,459
with Charles awesome so before we dive

132
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:07,198
into the the products in the microbial

133
00:05:05,459 --> 00:05:09,120
process itself can you tell me a little

134
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,560
bit more I guess a little more big

135
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,019
picture about how you founded the

136
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,280
company and uh yeah what what that all

137
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:16,859
looked like

138
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:18,359
yeah absolutely I'll kick us off there

139
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:20,639
so

140
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:24,120
um as I sort of you know alluded to in

141
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:28,019
my my uh introduction

142
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:30,180
um it started with recognizing what we

143
00:05:28,019 --> 00:05:32,519
see as as a huge

144
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:34,740
um environmental problem

145
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:36,839
um that also presented a really major

146
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:40,379
opportunity

147
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:43,319
um specifically uh what we started the

148
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:46,319
company focused on is the amount of

149
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:49,259
organic matter food and plant matter

150
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:51,659
that is treated as waste and the

151
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:53,580
environmental repercussions of that

152
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:56,939
as you probably know Tad about a third

153
00:05:53,579 --> 00:05:59,819
of food produced globally is wasted

154
00:05:56,939 --> 00:06:01,819
every year that has huge repercussions

155
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:04,319
in terms of greenhouse gas emissions

156
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:06,779
particularly uh with the production of

157
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,879
methane which is an especially potent

158
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:11,879
greenhouse gas

159
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:14,459
um and as you know I was kind of digging

160
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:17,459
into that that problem

161
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:20,099
wanted to come up with with ways that

162
00:06:17,459 --> 00:06:22,258
sort of the value in that wasted plant

163
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:24,240
matter could be unlocked

164
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:26,160
you may notice that I I try very

165
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,139
deliberately not to say plant waste or

166
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,560
food waste because we actually like to

167
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:33,900
say there's no such thing as plant waste

168
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:36,720
a lot of plant matter is wasted but

169
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:39,359
there is a lot of value uh potential

170
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,919
that's left in that you know in the

171
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,439
stalks and the leaves and everything

172
00:06:40,918 --> 00:06:45,120
that's left over not eaten or sold or or

173
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:48,000
what have you

174
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,579
um and of course as you as you know very

175
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,759
well microorganisms are the way that

176
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:55,918
nature deals with that that challenge

177
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:57,960
turns stock sleeves Etc into nutrients

178
00:06:55,918 --> 00:06:59,240
so that the next generation of plants

179
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:04,019
can grow

180
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:08,460
and our idea was that if we can develop

181
00:07:04,019 --> 00:07:10,500
a combination of microbes that can do

182
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:13,198
that job really quickly consistently

183
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,819
efficiently we could make it much more

184
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,220
accessible for more people to recycle

185
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:19,460
their plant matter

186
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:22,139
and do really good things for our planet

187
00:07:19,459 --> 00:07:23,879
and for you know of course the plants

188
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:25,680
that people are growing both at home and

189
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:28,560
commercially

190
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,360
um so that product became regen which is

191
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,220
the first the first product that we

192
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,598
started the company around uh we got

193
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,520
some funding from the National Science

194
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:37,620
Foundation to develop that product

195
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:38,579
Victoria can speak a little bit more of

196
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:40,019
that

197
00:07:38,579 --> 00:07:42,000
um but then as we kind of you know we're

198
00:07:40,019 --> 00:07:44,159
getting out in the market with regen and

199
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,740
talking to a lot of really great Growers

200
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,479
of all sorts of plants but especially

201
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:50,460
cannabis

202
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:52,258
um we came to understand sort of the the

203
00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:55,198
really large

204
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:57,240
um world of opportunity for microbes to

205
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,538
do really good things for people to to

206
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:02,460
grow plants Health in a more healthy way

207
00:07:59,538 --> 00:08:04,680
that would be you know good for growers

208
00:08:02,459 --> 00:08:06,779
in terms of their output and much better

209
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:09,120
for our planet

210
00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:12,719
um both in in terms of how we eliminate

211
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:15,060
uh quote unquote waste and also replace

212
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:18,419
chemical inputs uh with naturally

213
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:19,860
occurring microbes yeah and I'm I have

214
00:08:18,418 --> 00:08:21,120
some questions for you next Victoria but

215
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,720
I have to say

216
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,180
um

217
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:26,039
the the regen product I think is really

218
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:27,780
interesting and I'm still wrapping my

219
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:30,240
brain around some of the applications

220
00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:33,120
within cannabis I absolutely see them

221
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:36,180
within agriculture uh here in Washington

222
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,580
state the way we dispose of plant matter

223
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:39,838
uh makes it a little bit problematic but

224
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:43,020
I would like to dive into that a little

225
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:45,540
more with you but what I was so excited

226
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:47,899
for and this is something I think it

227
00:08:45,539 --> 00:08:50,879
goes back probably almost a decade now

228
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:54,120
within the organic cannabis side there's

229
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:56,299
never been a good organic option for

230
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,679
cloning and propagation

231
00:08:56,299 --> 00:09:00,599
I I did my own little trials and

232
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:02,819
experiment and end up with a huge moldy

233
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,220
mess trying to create my own uh back in

234
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:08,640
the day you hear people using aloe vera

235
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:11,100
with some success but um you know not

236
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:12,838
being a microbiologist I I had to go

237
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:15,899
like on the fertility route trying to

238
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:18,300
figure out a solution for propagation

239
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:21,240
now you guys came up with a microbial

240
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:23,939
solution for propagation that I think is

241
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:25,980
really interesting

242
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:27,240
Victoria can you talk a little bit about

243
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:29,220
that

244
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:31,200
development process like how did you go

245
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:32,700
about once you guys decided you know you

246
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,160
wanted to create regen or you wanted to

247
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:38,100
create root what that looks like on your

248
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:40,620
end is a scientist yeah so I'll start

249
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:43,159
with with root first just because that's

250
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:46,860
the one you mentioned being particularly

251
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:49,799
excited about for this conversation

252
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:52,860
um when we came up with the idea to

253
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:56,219
create this organic natural cloning

254
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:59,639
solution we first kind of looked at what

255
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:02,278
else Growers were using and what were

256
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:07,139
the components of that product that

257
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:11,958
either helped it work well or caused

258
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:15,958
these other less exciting

259
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:16,500
potential drawbacks to its use

260
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:20,099
um

261
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:22,740
so the the main things in synthetic

262
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:25,320
cloning solutions that are good for the

263
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:28,139
plants are indole-3 acetic acid and

264
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,339
gibberellic acid which are two hormones

265
00:10:28,139 --> 00:10:32,039
that help

266
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:34,920
develop roots and these are both

267
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:39,000
hormones that microbes can produce

268
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:41,759
themselves and so we simply went to

269
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,100
published research read a lot of papers

270
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:46,559
and tried to find microbes that are

271
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:49,019
naturally occurring that produce them on

272
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:52,259
their own at concentrations that could

273
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:55,620
be useful to plants we tested a few

274
00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:58,799
different combinations of these microbes

275
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:00,600
we tested the microbes individually and

276
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:04,679
then started applying them to plants and

277
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:07,980
seeing which combinations could help

278
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:10,799
help the plants root in a way that

279
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:12,959
didn't involve the synthetic chemicals

280
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:15,419
that can be really harmful to people

281
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:17,458
plants and planet

282
00:11:15,419 --> 00:11:21,179
um frankly so

283
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:23,039
it really started researching what other

284
00:11:21,179 --> 00:11:24,719
people have already done bringing them

285
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:28,139
together and moving that knowledge

286
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:30,240
forward to create the root product so

287
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:33,838
once you identified you know a

288
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:36,299
particular strain of bacteria or you

289
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:38,820
know A fungi I don't know a ton about

290
00:11:36,299 --> 00:11:41,039
the product to be fair I've talked about

291
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:43,980
about a little bit with Charles but once

292
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:46,199
you identified this these these how did

293
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:48,659
you go about collecting your your

294
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,879
initial specimens and then determining

295
00:11:48,659 --> 00:11:52,919
what sort of synergistic effects you

296
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:55,200
might be looking for getting from the

297
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:58,559
microbes themselves yeah that's a great

298
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:01,620
question the way that we proceeded to

299
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:04,739
Source these microbes was by acquiring

300
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:07,320
them from strain collections so similar

301
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:10,139
to seed banks there are microbial Banks

302
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:12,839
where you can purchase them and then

303
00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:15,059
work with them in your own lab so that's

304
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:17,160
predominantly the way that we have

305
00:12:15,059 --> 00:12:19,679
sourced the microbes in root though we

306
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:20,519
have done done some work with

307
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:22,559
um

308
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:25,980
isolating microbes from the natural

309
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:28,859
environment around us but for the time

310
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:32,519
being root contains microbes that we've

311
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:34,680
acquired from from these micro Banks

312
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:36,720
piggybacking on that a little bit you

313
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:38,759
know one of the reasons that we we take

314
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,860
the approach that Victoria described in

315
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:42,958
kind of identifying what we described as

316
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:45,839
candidate microbes and then sort of

317
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:47,399
vetting them first through research then

318
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,920
you know then of course with our own

319
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:51,120
experimentation individually and in a

320
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:53,719
consortia

321
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:57,419
it's really important to us that we know

322
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:58,560
exactly what is in root and regen and

323
00:12:57,419 --> 00:13:02,338
all of our

324
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:05,219
all of our inoculants because we want to

325
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:08,639
make sure that first of all we can you

326
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:11,100
know ensure that we're avoiding

327
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:13,980
spreading any sort of potential

328
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:15,240
pathogens anything that could uh you

329
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:17,100
know replace what we see as a big

330
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:19,440
chemical problem with a biological

331
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:21,720
problem you know our sort of betting

332
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,120
process involves immediately eliminating

333
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:26,820
any you know candidate microbes that

334
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:29,399
could become problematic for for people

335
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:32,339
or for animals or of course for the

336
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:34,139
environment if they were to be ingested

337
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:37,200
or kind of be in a place where we

338
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:38,940
wouldn't expect them to be so

339
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,320
again that was sort of part of our

340
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:43,320
rationale let's make sure we understand

341
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:45,959
exactly what what's going on here

342
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:48,778
um and the other you know sort of

343
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:52,259
ongoing benefit to that from a practical

344
00:13:48,778 --> 00:13:54,659
standpoint is um it's really uh helpful

345
00:13:52,259 --> 00:13:56,939
for production consistency

346
00:13:54,659 --> 00:14:00,419
um so again knowing sort of inside and

347
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:02,700
out every individual bacteria and fungi

348
00:14:00,419 --> 00:14:05,219
that is in each of our products allows

349
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:07,860
us to produce them

350
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:10,019
um very consistently first as an

351
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:12,240
individual uh microbe and then

352
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:14,879
ultimately combined in a particular

353
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:19,379
ratio that that we found to be most

354
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:21,179
effective so most of the products for

355
00:14:19,379 --> 00:14:23,399
propagation if we're talking about root

356
00:14:21,179 --> 00:14:25,620
here first are

357
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:28,139
they're not microbial based

358
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:29,159
is that is that a fair statement based

359
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:30,360
on your I mean you guys are more

360
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:32,819
familiar in this

361
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,778
area to me they're the ones that I see

362
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:36,480
are

363
00:14:33,778 --> 00:14:37,919
as far as I know salicylic acid or IBA

364
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,720
products

365
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:41,399
um

366
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:43,139
and the goal was with this microbial

367
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:44,159
product to get comparable or better

368
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:46,198
results

369
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:48,719
right I think that was what we exactly

370
00:14:46,198 --> 00:14:51,479
we talked about so

371
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:55,259
um how knowing that this approach

372
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:56,459
it differs how what what sort of um what

373
00:14:55,259 --> 00:15:00,439
sort of results are you guys getting

374
00:14:56,458 --> 00:15:02,578
with root using microbes instead of

375
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:05,459
direct chemicals

376
00:15:02,578 --> 00:15:08,099
yeah we get great results

377
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:11,219
um we have uh we're you know we're

378
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:14,159
always aiming to be the best product out

379
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:17,820
there and for a lot of strains and a lot

380
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:21,958
of different growth Medias uh we do have

381
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:26,100
the fastest and most robust rooting for

382
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:28,439
some strains of cannabis we have uh

383
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:30,899
we're on par with those synthetic

384
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:33,540
competitors which is actually a result

385
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:36,539
that our trial with you showed one

386
00:15:33,539 --> 00:15:39,120
strain root did better than the com the

387
00:15:36,539 --> 00:15:42,240
competitor in one strain did exactly the

388
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:44,940
same and we feel great about that for a

389
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:48,959
handful of reasons one is that

390
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:52,260
it's a real scientific living microbial

391
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:56,219
product it's not going to be perfect all

392
00:15:52,259 --> 00:15:58,319
the time it's okay that it is as good as

393
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,339
but often better

394
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,720
um

395
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:04,800
it's safer it also

396
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:08,300
provides better long-term results

397
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:11,219
because you are giving these plants

398
00:16:08,299 --> 00:16:13,740
symbiotic endophytic microbes that

399
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:16,980
benefit their whole lifespan and not

400
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:20,220
just that initial rooting stage so the

401
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:21,420
benefits are even longer term

402
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:24,180
um

403
00:16:21,419 --> 00:16:25,860
and so those are some of the the results

404
00:16:24,179 --> 00:16:28,939
that we're seeing from our Growers now

405
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:34,159
both better rooting faster rooting

406
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:36,720
shorter time and veg higher yields

407
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:39,600
more successful cloning all around and

408
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,060
we feel great about that so for for a

409
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,740
Layman like myself

410
00:16:41,059 --> 00:16:45,479
essentially as I understand it then

411
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:48,959
would be I'm getting it I'm getting the

412
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:51,360
same chemicals as I would in clonex or

413
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:52,859
dip and grow or these other commercially

414
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,579
available products but I'm getting them

415
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:58,560
from this this microbial interaction

416
00:16:55,578 --> 00:17:00,059
with the soil and water and plant that

417
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:03,119
then allows

418
00:17:00,059 --> 00:17:05,119
um for for potentially at least

419
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:08,039
comparable but potentially better

420
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:09,298
results down the road so propagate let's

421
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:12,899
say I get

422
00:17:09,298 --> 00:17:14,039
95 propagation success

423
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:17,160
um where you're seeing the big

424
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:19,078
differentiation is as the plant starts

425
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:21,600
growing it's true leaves as it gets a

426
00:17:19,078 --> 00:17:23,578
little bigger through veg you may see

427
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:25,259
um some persistence with these microbes

428
00:17:23,578 --> 00:17:28,019
that would lead to better veg growth

429
00:17:25,259 --> 00:17:29,339
compared to the control of of clonics or

430
00:17:28,019 --> 00:17:31,079
dip and grow or these other commercially

431
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:32,519
available products is that right or do

432
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:33,779
you want to add to that or talk about

433
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:36,418
some of the research that you've done

434
00:17:33,779 --> 00:17:38,579
yeah that's right and you know happy to

435
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:39,960
sort of add you know some of the example

436
00:17:38,579 --> 00:17:42,899
you know data that we've gotten back

437
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:45,298
from from some of our our customers and

438
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,900
Growers that we work with closely

439
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:48,798
um

440
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:51,840
as Victoria described you know because

441
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:54,720
root creates this symbiotic relationship

442
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:56,459
with the plants the benefits do really

443
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,140
you know continue as the plant keeps

444
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:00,179
growing uh sort of that the difference

445
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:02,220
between a chemical shock from a clonex

446
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:05,460
or a dipping grow that of course is

447
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:08,339
effective in in you know forming in

448
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:09,019
Roots but then kind of goes away

449
00:18:08,339 --> 00:18:12,000
um

450
00:18:09,019 --> 00:18:14,220
whereas the root microbes you know

451
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,200
continue to live within the plant tissue

452
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:18,960
within the roots within the the

453
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:22,440
substrate and

454
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:24,660
that has translated to um really you

455
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:27,960
know exciting results in in the

456
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:30,900
vegetative uh Pro stage some of our

457
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:35,880
customers have noted you know reducing

458
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:37,140
bed Cycles from uh from 30 days down to

459
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,120
20.

460
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:42,000
um I think that the biggest change we

461
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:45,058
had was maybe like a you know

462
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,519
um a 28 down to 14

463
00:18:45,058 --> 00:18:49,500
um cycle for sort of the the kind of veg

464
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:51,900
stage parameters that that this grower

465
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:54,900
was was looking for and

466
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:57,298
um you know you kind of mentioned to add

467
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:59,280
the interactions within the soil

468
00:18:57,298 --> 00:19:01,259
of course you know root is a really

469
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:04,619
exciting way to introduce you know

470
00:19:01,259 --> 00:19:07,259
microbes into the soil but but also into

471
00:19:04,619 --> 00:19:09,538
you know the plant itself kind of taking

472
00:19:07,259 --> 00:19:11,700
advantage of the access that is created

473
00:19:09,538 --> 00:19:14,700
when you dip that cutting directly into

474
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:16,080
this microbial consortia and that's

475
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:18,480
something that we've seen translate to

476
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:19,740
really exciting results also in in

477
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,360
rockwool

478
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:22,558
um in Cocoa

479
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:24,839
um you know of course we're big

480
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:27,418
Believers in In Living soil

481
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:29,879
um ourselves but we've also seen you

482
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:32,940
know kind of the the benefits of using

483
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:36,419
root in uh in you know

484
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:38,700
soilless substrates as well and

485
00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:42,660
in some ways you know it's it's kind of

486
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:44,819
a unique introduction to microbes in an

487
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:47,340
environment where they can Thrive within

488
00:19:44,819 --> 00:19:50,399
the plant even if the substrate is not

489
00:19:47,339 --> 00:19:52,199
kind of optimized for microbial life

490
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,538
so you're seeing good results in in

491
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:56,759
rockwool for example or coco core where

492
00:19:54,538 --> 00:19:58,980
you may not have any microbial ecology

493
00:19:56,759 --> 00:20:01,200
so even with the chemical mineral salt

494
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:03,000
program you can still see results is

495
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,220
what you're what you're saying

496
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,660
that's right okay

497
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,980
um all right so tell me about what's in

498
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:12,179
root

499
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:14,759
so root is comprised of

500
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:17,640
um a few different families of microbes

501
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:22,220
that all provide some some good benefits

502
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:24,840
to the customer the main category that

503
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:28,440
provides a lot of those benefits are the

504
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:31,500
indole-3 acetic acid or IAA and

505
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:35,400
gibberellic acid producers so these

506
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:37,500
microbes make natural versions of those

507
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:40,740
hormones that are often included in

508
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:43,079
products like clonex or Max

509
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:46,558
Etc and then another category of

510
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:48,960
microbes that are included in our

511
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:51,720
product are endophytes so these are

512
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,640
microbes that can actually enter the

513
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:57,058
vascular tissue of plants and form

514
00:20:53,640 --> 00:21:00,120
symbiotic relationships and and help the

515
00:20:57,058 --> 00:21:04,558
plant with things like it's

516
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:07,199
um health and vigor so those are two

517
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:10,619
really important components of root

518
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:13,259
product and then root also contains a

519
00:21:10,619 --> 00:21:16,798
natural gelling agent called guar gum

520
00:21:13,259 --> 00:21:19,140
that's isolated from legumes so this is

521
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:21,660
the product that helps form that gel

522
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:24,600
that Growers really often like to dip

523
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:27,058
their clones into and finally it

524
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:30,418
contains a little bit of yeast extract

525
00:21:27,058 --> 00:21:34,139
and sugar and those are just included to

526
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:37,080
help the the microbes have something to

527
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:40,740
eat when they are initially woken up

528
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:41,819
from lyophilization or the freeze drying

529
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:44,099
process

530
00:21:41,819 --> 00:21:47,038
now speaking of

531
00:21:44,099 --> 00:21:48,719
um microbes one other thing and one of

532
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:51,179
the reasons for my original skepticism

533
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,279
is just there's a lot of people that are

534
00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:54,480
there's a lot of companies and products

535
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:56,220
on the market right now that are

536
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:59,700
microbial based it's one of the fastest

537
00:21:56,220 --> 00:22:02,339
growing segments of

538
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:03,720
I think agriculture in general right now

539
00:22:02,339 --> 00:22:05,459
which would most people call

540
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:08,519
biostimulants

541
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:11,700
but some of them are just sourcing bulk

542
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:13,558
powders from China you know they'll buy

543
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:16,019
bacillus subtilis

544
00:22:13,558 --> 00:22:18,658
because they you know you can read about

545
00:22:16,019 --> 00:22:21,779
the some of the research around that but

546
00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:23,120
um what are the differences with Meo and

547
00:22:21,779 --> 00:22:25,678
the advantages

548
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:28,739
associated with culturing your own

549
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:31,320
microbes and controlling that process

550
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:32,700
versus

551
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:34,139
what many of these companies do they're

552
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,519
just buying these powders and

553
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:36,840
essentially mixing these microbes

554
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:39,779
together

555
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:41,759
yeah I think our our biggest Advantage

556
00:22:39,779 --> 00:22:45,298
with the way that we do it which of

557
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:47,960
course is we grow our microbes from a

558
00:22:45,298 --> 00:22:51,720
frozen one milliliter

559
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:54,659
microbial stock into tens of liters of

560
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:56,759
microbes is that this allows us to

561
00:22:54,659 --> 00:22:58,919
control every step of the process it

562
00:22:56,759 --> 00:23:00,658
allows us to have a lot of room for

563
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:03,419
quality assurance and quality control

564
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:05,880
and it helps us make the product really

565
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:09,240
consistent because we're growing each

566
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:11,880
microbe individually combining them at

567
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:14,579
the ratios that we have determined to be

568
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:16,799
the most beneficial to plants and and

569
00:23:14,579 --> 00:23:19,678
checking them along the way through all

570
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:22,079
of the steps of the process because

571
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,120
as I've mentioned these these microbes

572
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:27,058
are

573
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:29,279
alive and if you don't if you're unable

574
00:23:27,058 --> 00:23:31,200
to provide them at the right stage of

575
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:33,658
their life cycle

576
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:36,779
um they could be much less consistent

577
00:23:33,659 --> 00:23:40,260
much less beneficial or oftentimes

578
00:23:36,779 --> 00:23:43,500
dead unfortunately

579
00:23:40,259 --> 00:23:46,200
yeah yeah that's a real concern uh with

580
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:48,359
on shelf products the Oregon Department

581
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,919
of AG I've had them on the podcast and

582
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:53,639
they they shared some of their research

583
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:55,140
that they did independently and it may

584
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,240
not be a reflection of the original

585
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:58,440
quality of the product but the fact it

586
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:01,259
may have been stored in a warehouse

587
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:03,179
exposed to sunlight heat you know

588
00:24:01,259 --> 00:24:06,058
temperature extremes can definitely

589
00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:08,880
degrade products so uh

590
00:24:06,058 --> 00:24:11,658
the way you're structured right now is

591
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:16,140
shipping direct from

592
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:18,659
your facility to the grower itself so if

593
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:20,759
for example if someone ordered root or

594
00:24:18,659 --> 00:24:22,440
crit kiss or regen they would ship

595
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:24,960
directly from you to them so there

596
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:29,220
wouldn't be an issue of expiration dates

597
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:32,759
freshness or quality correct and we do a

598
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:34,500
lot of work to maintain and check on the

599
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:36,599
quality so

600
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:38,819
um as I've mentioned we we check that

601
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:41,699
the microbes are still alive at various

602
00:24:38,819 --> 00:24:43,918
stages we do a lot of our own

603
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:45,840
experiments with cannabis clones and

604
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:48,538
other plants to make sure that the

605
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:53,279
product is working at different time

606
00:24:48,538 --> 00:24:55,919
points of its lifespan so we feel really

607
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:57,359
strongly that that's the work we have to

608
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,759
do on our end to make sure we're

609
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:01,558
providing customers with a consistent

610
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:04,319
strong product

611
00:25:01,558 --> 00:25:07,619
you know that to your point about kind

612
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:09,720
of shipping directly to to Growers that

613
00:25:07,619 --> 00:25:12,359
was the only way that we would operate

614
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:15,120
for kind of the the earlier stages of

615
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:16,558
the company when we were shipping out a

616
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:18,298
liquid

617
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:21,058
um or gel version of our product

618
00:25:18,298 --> 00:25:24,058
directly because that of course was a

619
00:25:21,058 --> 00:25:26,940
live culture it was active

620
00:25:24,058 --> 00:25:29,940
um and as you described we needed to be

621
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:32,038
very conscious of time of temperature

622
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:34,500
you know even thinking about things like

623
00:25:32,038 --> 00:25:36,558
pressure fluctuations anything that

624
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:38,759
might happen in transit that could

625
00:25:36,558 --> 00:25:41,639
damage the health of the microbial

626
00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:43,740
Community because of course as as you

627
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:45,840
both were just saying the microbes have

628
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:48,179
to be alive to form a symbiotic

629
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:51,240
relationship with the plant to do the to

630
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:53,820
provide the benefits that they can offer

631
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:57,240
um Victoria and our our whole science

632
00:25:53,819 --> 00:25:59,038
team have been very hard at work on a

633
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,859
freeze drying process called

634
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:04,558
lyophilization which Victoria can can

635
00:26:01,859 --> 00:26:07,379
expand on but which essentially allows

636
00:26:04,558 --> 00:26:09,000
us to take each individual microbe

637
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:11,760
um run it through this this

638
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,700
myopolization process that controls both

639
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:18,179
temperature and pressure to remove and

640
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:21,360
freeze the moisture from the microbes

641
00:26:18,179 --> 00:26:23,820
um without exploding their cells and so

642
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:25,979
now we can send out a shelf stable

643
00:26:23,819 --> 00:26:27,658
powder that is

644
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:30,778
um you know essentially has the microbes

645
00:26:27,659 --> 00:26:32,760
in a dormant State until water is added

646
00:26:30,778 --> 00:26:35,038
and and the property comes ready to use

647
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:37,379
when the grower is ready to use it

648
00:26:35,038 --> 00:26:39,538
so that was you know kind of an

649
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:42,120
essential step for for us from our

650
00:26:39,538 --> 00:26:44,220
perspective before we would you know

651
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:46,918
kind of entertain any possibilities of

652
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:50,038
of there being any steps between you

653
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:52,140
know us and and The Growers as you

654
00:26:50,038 --> 00:26:53,879
described we of course continue to love

655
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:55,380
to work directly with Growers and and

656
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:57,720
working with kiss is going to be a great

657
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:59,940
way to kind of bring more people

658
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:02,819
um into into that network but as you

659
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:05,100
said to also send send them directly

660
00:27:02,819 --> 00:27:07,500
um but just wanted to kind of emphasize

661
00:27:05,099 --> 00:27:10,740
you know the the efforts around

662
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:12,720
consistency and ensuring viability you

663
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:15,000
know it takes every step along our

664
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:17,339
production process and then you know

665
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,960
it's kind of accumulates with this this

666
00:27:17,339 --> 00:27:21,599
light opalization this freeze drying

667
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:23,940
process so that we can take take out

668
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:26,158
kind of the variables of could something

669
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:28,500
go wrong in transit because you know if

670
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:30,179
it's a live liquid product the answer to

671
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:32,880
that from our perspective is is

672
00:27:30,179 --> 00:27:34,380
absolutely yes another question I had

673
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,179
because

674
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:38,340
um this is becoming a bigger issue in

675
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:40,559
cannabis is heavy metals can you talk

676
00:27:38,339 --> 00:27:42,178
about that a little bit

677
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:46,019
yes

678
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:48,960
um so specifically I can say that we

679
00:27:46,019 --> 00:27:51,720
have had both of our products tested for

680
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:55,079
heavy metal concentrations

681
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:57,419
um we're currently going through the all

682
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:59,460
the states regulatory processes with the

683
00:27:57,419 --> 00:28:03,059
different Departments of AG so that is a

684
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:05,640
requirement of those processes and our

685
00:28:03,058 --> 00:28:09,899
products are uh

686
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:10,620
all set on that end which is wonderful

687
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:13,860
um

688
00:28:10,619 --> 00:28:16,739
around Regen

689
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:19,439
which is our

690
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:21,778
recycling product

691
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,519
um we have definitely talked to Growers

692
00:28:21,778 --> 00:28:27,240
who have talked about the fact that

693
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:30,839
cannabis can be used as a bioaccumulator

694
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:33,839
plant when it grows it can absorb the

695
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:37,740
heavy metals from its environment and so

696
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:40,980
um it is a concern of repeated cycles of

697
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:43,740
regen recycling on

698
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:46,319
hemp or cannabis that has grown in heavy

699
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:50,038
metal Rich soils you know what is the

700
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:54,058
impact of that and there's still a lot

701
00:28:50,038 --> 00:28:57,058
more testing to be done but

702
00:28:54,058 --> 00:29:00,778
the the first test that we've done it

703
00:28:57,058 --> 00:29:04,200
seems to be not a problem we haven't

704
00:29:00,778 --> 00:29:06,359
done repeated cycles of regen growth and

705
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:09,419
then tested the heavy metals on that so

706
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:12,479
that is something that we are

707
00:29:09,419 --> 00:29:14,580
very interested in doing and again like

708
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,278
Charles said before small team lots of

709
00:29:14,579 --> 00:29:19,079
questions

710
00:29:16,278 --> 00:29:20,940
one one thing I I just add to that is

711
00:29:19,079 --> 00:29:22,740
you know the the guidance that we tend

712
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:24,360
to give Growers if they're concerned

713
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:26,819
that they're sort of you know on the

714
00:29:24,359 --> 00:29:28,500
edge of uh permissible levels of of

715
00:29:26,819 --> 00:29:30,839
heavy metal

716
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:33,960
um we recommend that they do not recycle

717
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:36,240
the root ball in that scenario

718
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:38,759
um as as I I think you know Tad you know

719
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,558
the the roots tend to be

720
00:29:38,759 --> 00:29:42,359
um an area where

721
00:29:40,558 --> 00:29:45,480
um heavy metals become particularly

722
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:48,418
concentrated so uh sort of taking that

723
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:50,700
out of the recycling stream if you will

724
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:52,799
um you know I ideally having it end up

725
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:54,899
in another kind of compost process but

726
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:58,319
not immediately reintroduced back to

727
00:29:54,898 --> 00:30:00,178
your soil or or your own grow that's the

728
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:02,398
way that we've handled that in the past

729
00:30:00,179 --> 00:30:04,140
and as Victoria said

730
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:05,099
um you know all the testing that we have

731
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:07,440
done

732
00:30:05,099 --> 00:30:09,119
leads us to be you know comfortable with

733
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,759
the composition of the product and sort

734
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:13,859
of the recycling process overall

735
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:15,778
um but that that is kind of the the

736
00:30:13,859 --> 00:30:17,519
guidance that we give it's think a

737
00:30:15,778 --> 00:30:19,019
little separately about the the root

738
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:22,379
ball versus the stocks and the leaves

739
00:30:19,019 --> 00:30:23,879
yeah I I guess when I asked the question

740
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:27,120
I was thinking more in terms of the

741
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:28,679
product itself like uh root and region

742
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:29,879
not so much the material you're working

743
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:32,820
on

744
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:35,278
um that being said the amount that

745
00:30:32,819 --> 00:30:38,158
you're adding in in roots or even with

746
00:30:35,278 --> 00:30:40,859
regen is so minimal that I don't think

747
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:43,399
it would be a huge contributing factor

748
00:30:40,859 --> 00:30:47,278
to the overall heavy metal

749
00:30:43,398 --> 00:30:48,418
uh uptake or analysis

750
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:50,398
um but you have tested your products

751
00:30:48,419 --> 00:30:52,380
then and they are passing in the various

752
00:30:50,398 --> 00:30:53,639
oh yeah state regulations so that's

753
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:57,059
that's good to hear

754
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:59,038
um yeah way below any levels that would

755
00:30:57,058 --> 00:31:00,960
be uh concerning you know to Regulators

756
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:02,158
or Growers yeah I'll have to get that

757
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,079
from you to be able to have that

758
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:05,340
published on the website too yeah this

759
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:07,740
one's good

760
00:31:05,339 --> 00:31:10,019
Let's uh let's talk more about the

761
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:12,240
research now

762
00:31:10,019 --> 00:31:14,700
um what sorts of results and I'll I'll

763
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:17,940
get with uh Dr Ben Higgins and talk

764
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:19,860
about the uh the internal trial that he

765
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:21,298
ran over at goldleaf Gardens and his

766
00:31:19,859 --> 00:31:23,339
results

767
00:31:21,298 --> 00:31:24,720
um separately and we'll we'll tack it on

768
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:26,459
to this podcast

769
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,140
at the end but tell me a little bit more

770
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:30,600
about the other research that you guys

771
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:31,860
did um you did some work with UVM it

772
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:33,480
sounds like and then a few different

773
00:31:31,859 --> 00:31:35,699
facilities

774
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:39,419
and the one you want to jump in on that

775
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:41,819
yes we love collaboration so our our

776
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:44,880
work with the University of Vermont was

777
00:31:41,819 --> 00:31:48,178
actually on primarily our regen product

778
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:50,159
so as Charles mentioned we were awarded

779
00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:53,399
a National Science Foundation small

780
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:56,880
business Innovative research Grant in

781
00:31:53,398 --> 00:31:58,619
2020 and so as part of this grant we

782
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:01,380
were developing different formulations

783
00:31:58,619 --> 00:32:06,658
of free gen and then passing them off to

784
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:07,440
ubm for them to test us a third party so

785
00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:10,260
um

786
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:13,200
that was great we had a very strong

787
00:32:10,259 --> 00:32:15,658
collaborative uh relationship with Dr

788
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:18,720
Deb Nair and her graduate student Noah

789
00:32:15,659 --> 00:32:21,659
Olsen there that research is actually

790
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:23,640
under review for publishing and a

791
00:32:21,659 --> 00:32:25,440
journal called compost science and

792
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:28,380
utilization that we hope will be

793
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:30,960
accepted very shortly so

794
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:32,940
um we would love for everyone to take a

795
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:35,960
look at that if they're interested

796
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:39,899
and then with regards to

797
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:42,840
root and regen both we love to set up as

798
00:32:39,898 --> 00:32:46,019
many collaborative products or projects

799
00:32:42,839 --> 00:32:48,720
with Growers and Farmers as much as we

800
00:32:46,019 --> 00:32:51,179
possibly can we think there's a huge

801
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:55,620
value in this kind of third-party

802
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:58,440
validation and trusting expert Growers

803
00:32:55,619 --> 00:33:01,019
to insert our products into their

804
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:03,240
processes and then give us feedback on

805
00:33:01,019 --> 00:33:06,179
on how they work so Charles I don't know

806
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:09,720
if you I wanted to speak of them happy

807
00:33:06,179 --> 00:33:13,320
to and and um you know I'm glad you gave

808
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:16,319
a shout out specifically to to uh Dr Deb

809
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:18,898
Nair and and uh and to Noah Olson Noah I

810
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:20,519
know is is an avid listener of the

811
00:33:18,898 --> 00:33:24,119
podcast so

812
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:25,980
um uh and as you said uh Victoria UVM

813
00:33:24,119 --> 00:33:27,178
has been a great partner in collaborator

814
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:29,960
to us

815
00:33:27,179 --> 00:33:32,640
um generated tremendous data on on regen

816
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:34,380
quantifying not only the plant outcomes

817
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:37,799
you know they the yield improvements

818
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:39,720
that can happen with regen and recycling

819
00:33:37,798 --> 00:33:41,879
plant matter but also in really

820
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:44,460
quantifying the microbial actions the

821
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:47,159
ecoenzyme outputs to help us really

822
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:49,679
understand you know the the mechanisms

823
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:51,419
of of how these microbes are breaking

824
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:52,980
down the lignin and the cellulose you

825
00:33:51,419 --> 00:33:55,019
know they're really tough parts of the

826
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:58,380
plant matter in order to create access

827
00:33:55,019 --> 00:34:01,440
to the nutrients that they contain

828
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:03,179
um and uh We've also you know had had a

829
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:06,179
wonderful experience collaborating with

830
00:34:03,179 --> 00:34:10,099
with a lot of different great growers in

831
00:34:06,179 --> 00:34:13,619
Vermont in California Colorado Arizona

832
00:34:10,099 --> 00:34:15,780
and have generated tremendous data as

833
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:18,480
Victoria said it we really value you

834
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:21,480
know seeing you know what what regen and

835
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:24,358
root are going to do in a live you know

836
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:25,619
commercial cultivation environment where

837
00:34:24,358 --> 00:34:27,659
um there are all sorts of different

838
00:34:25,619 --> 00:34:29,639
variables at play and and you need to

839
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:33,179
make sure that the kind of product and

840
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:35,280
and the the science is is really strong

841
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:37,500
to make sure that you get consistent

842
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,720
results across all sorts of different

843
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:42,780
grow types and conditions which is is

844
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:44,279
very much what we've seen so

845
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:46,080
I'll mention

846
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:47,940
um you know a few specific results that

847
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:49,699
we've gotten with root

848
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:52,378
um one of our our

849
00:34:49,699 --> 00:34:54,299
customers out in California is a grow

850
00:34:52,378 --> 00:34:55,739
called floratera

851
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:59,220
um they're they've got a really strong

852
00:34:55,739 --> 00:35:01,979
uh cultivation team several uh several

853
00:34:59,219 --> 00:35:04,079
different retail locations as well

854
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:08,338
um they shared with us that when they

855
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:10,679
switch from clonex to root

856
00:35:08,338 --> 00:35:12,739
um they had a really wide range of

857
00:35:10,679 --> 00:35:15,179
benefits associated with that transition

858
00:35:12,739 --> 00:35:17,159
they had been struggling uh

859
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:19,379
significantly with with a fungal

860
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:20,578
pathogen that was

861
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:23,039
um really giving them a lot of trouble

862
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:24,660
in their cloning process

863
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:27,119
um so they had a cloning success rate

864
00:35:24,659 --> 00:35:28,858
that was way below their targets um they

865
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:31,619
had to kind of you know keep taking more

866
00:35:28,858 --> 00:35:33,358
cuttings from plants that that they

867
00:35:31,619 --> 00:35:35,820
didn't necessarily want to kind of put

868
00:35:33,358 --> 00:35:37,619
into the the mother plant category and

869
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:39,720
unfortunately we're caught in a really

870
00:35:37,619 --> 00:35:42,838
tough cycle

871
00:35:39,719 --> 00:35:45,059
um you know since transitioning to root

872
00:35:42,838 --> 00:35:47,460
um they have gotten their cloning

873
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:49,679
success rate uh way be up there above

874
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:52,380
their their target rate they're now you

875
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:54,299
know around a 95 success rate and remind

876
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:56,280
you they're doing

877
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:59,760
um you know a kind of peak clone times

878
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:00,839
they're doing about uh 20 000 cuttings a

879
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,760
month

880
00:36:00,838 --> 00:36:04,799
um

881
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:06,900
they are no longer struggling with with

882
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:09,000
the fungal pathogen

883
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:12,300
um they've increased their yields

884
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:14,940
um they're they've set room records

885
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:16,019
um with uh with plants treated with with

886
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:17,460
roots

887
00:36:16,019 --> 00:36:20,579
um and they're one of the examples that

888
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:23,159
I mentioned before in terms of the uh

889
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:26,039
accelerated vegetative growth times they

890
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:27,960
have been running 28-day vegetables and

891
00:36:26,039 --> 00:36:29,519
in switching to root um they're down to

892
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:31,619
10 day cycles

893
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:33,780
that's a that's a massive difference in

894
00:36:31,619 --> 00:36:36,480
Savings in uh

895
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:39,180
electricity and other resources that's

896
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,980
great totally we've we've been really

897
00:36:39,179 --> 00:36:43,379
you know excited to be part of that

898
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:45,719
transition and grateful to them in in

899
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:48,420
their meticulous uh you know Data

900
00:36:45,719 --> 00:36:51,659
Tracking to be able to share such clear

901
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:55,500
uh results with us as you know to edit

902
00:36:51,659 --> 00:36:58,559
you know doing good good science takes a

903
00:36:55,500 --> 00:37:01,019
lot of uh you know focus and and data

904
00:36:58,559 --> 00:37:04,320
and so uh yeah as I said we're great

905
00:37:01,019 --> 00:37:05,940
grateful to their team for

906
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:08,220
um you know all the tracking that they

907
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:09,659
did to provide us with these really uh

908
00:37:08,219 --> 00:37:11,939
really clear results

909
00:37:09,659 --> 00:37:14,039
great well I will have I will have Ben

910
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:15,539
on to talk more about the results in

911
00:37:14,039 --> 00:37:17,759
Gold Leaf so

912
00:37:15,539 --> 00:37:19,920
um just in the interest of time I think

913
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:23,160
I covered most of the questions that I

914
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:24,358
had for you guys at least around Roots I

915
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:25,559
did want to talk a little bit about

916
00:37:24,358 --> 00:37:26,940
region

917
00:37:25,559 --> 00:37:28,679
um it's not a product that we tested

918
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:29,940
internally uh for some of the reasons

919
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:33,899
that we talked about

920
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:35,760
uh I guess by you and I had had dinner

921
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:37,920
together and we talked about some of the

922
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:39,540
applications outside of the Cannabis

923
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,159
industry

924
00:37:39,539 --> 00:37:44,039
um but why don't we talk about some of

925
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:46,559
the the potential uses for that product

926
00:37:44,039 --> 00:37:48,539
and how people are using it and what the

927
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:50,338
what the results might be

928
00:37:48,539 --> 00:37:51,838
um as and I can I can ask questions

929
00:37:50,338 --> 00:37:54,900
around that because I have a few more

930
00:37:51,838 --> 00:37:56,880
about regen itself but yeah why don't

931
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:58,380
you just go ahead and share some of that

932
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,880
for sure

933
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:01,858
um Victoria you want me to get it

934
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:03,119
started there and you can kind of jump

935
00:38:01,858 --> 00:38:04,799
in

936
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:06,240
I guess I'll explain the science behind

937
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,920
it a little bit and then maybe you can

938
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:13,039
talk and talk about the applications of

939
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:15,599
it perfect but I the idea behind regen

940
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:16,858
predominantly centered around the fact

941
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:19,619
that

942
00:38:16,858 --> 00:38:21,779
um hemp and cannabis in particular have

943
00:38:19,619 --> 00:38:24,000
a really high concentration of this

944
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:25,619
difficult to degrade molecule called

945
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,920
lignin

946
00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:32,700
um so for fellow science nerds out there

947
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:35,338
lignan is very aromatic Rich so it forms

948
00:38:32,699 --> 00:38:38,519
these carbon rings that take a lot of

949
00:38:35,338 --> 00:38:41,159
energy to break down but behind and

950
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:43,858
underneath all of that lignin are

951
00:38:41,159 --> 00:38:47,279
cellulose hemicellulose and all of the

952
00:38:43,858 --> 00:38:49,799
nutrients that help the plant uh exist

953
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:53,400
and continue to grow and so when you

954
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:56,400
think about breaking down cannabis

955
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:59,940
to release those nutrients you first

956
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:02,700
need to break through the lignin and so

957
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:04,679
that is the main molecule that we were

958
00:39:02,699 --> 00:39:07,139
thinking about breaking down when we

959
00:39:04,679 --> 00:39:10,019
were looking into candidate microbes to

960
00:39:07,139 --> 00:39:12,598
bring together into our regen product

961
00:39:10,019 --> 00:39:16,679
so there are a few different enzymes

962
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:17,519
that can be used to break lignin down we

963
00:39:16,679 --> 00:39:20,239
found

964
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:22,679
quite a few microbes

965
00:39:20,239 --> 00:39:25,679
bacteria and fungi that are able to

966
00:39:22,679 --> 00:39:28,739
produce those enzymes

967
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:32,838
um we tested the individual microbes

968
00:39:28,739 --> 00:39:35,879
ability to produce those enzymes the

969
00:39:32,838 --> 00:39:38,219
Consortium the various

970
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:41,039
formulations that we tested and their

971
00:39:38,219 --> 00:39:45,358
ability to produce those enzymes

972
00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:47,699
um and based on all of our different uh

973
00:39:45,358 --> 00:39:50,519
combinations testings I think we

974
00:39:47,699 --> 00:39:52,379
ultimately tested like over a dozen

975
00:39:50,519 --> 00:39:54,480
different formulations of regen before

976
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:57,180
we found the one that worked the best

977
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:59,820
and that we were most excited about

978
00:39:57,179 --> 00:40:02,759
then we were able to hand that product

979
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:06,059
off to UVM for them to test it and send

980
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:07,500
some more uh ecoenzyme assay types of

981
00:40:06,059 --> 00:40:10,500
ways so

982
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:11,820
and then recycling the plant matter

983
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:13,980
so

984
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:16,500
we love that product it's very

985
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:19,679
conceptually exciting to the both of us

986
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:23,699
it's of course in a lot of ways what got

987
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:26,519
emeo started due to that MSS Grant

988
00:40:23,699 --> 00:40:27,659
um so I'm excited for Charles to talk a

989
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:30,780
little bit more about the applications

990
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:33,059
of it yeah and and again just say Echo

991
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:37,140
Victoria it is kind of the product that

992
00:40:33,059 --> 00:40:39,000
we see is kind of the biggest idea the

993
00:40:37,139 --> 00:40:41,219
the biggest

994
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,338
um potential impact that we can have you

995
00:40:41,219 --> 00:40:46,679
know uh around kind of

996
00:40:43,338 --> 00:40:48,539
Agriculture and and the environment

997
00:40:46,679 --> 00:40:49,858
um where of course you know as an

998
00:40:48,539 --> 00:40:52,559
environmentally focused company we're

999
00:40:49,858 --> 00:40:54,539
very excited anytime we can eliminate a

1000
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:56,159
harmful chemical and and root is

1001
00:40:54,539 --> 00:40:57,779
certainly a product that does that and

1002
00:40:56,159 --> 00:41:01,319
and leads to better planned outcomes

1003
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:04,260
well you know taking away what what can

1004
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:07,500
often be a a dangerous uh

1005
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:10,740
chemical input but Regen

1006
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:12,960
uh as you describe CAD can be used in an

1007
00:41:10,739 --> 00:41:15,239
agricultural setting can also be used in

1008
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:17,460
in you know commercial cannabis

1009
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:19,739
cultivation or home gardens as well

1010
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:22,740
anywhere you've got plant residuals and

1011
00:41:19,739 --> 00:41:23,578
and kind of a demand for nutrients

1012
00:41:22,739 --> 00:41:27,059
um

1013
00:41:23,579 --> 00:41:28,380
we've had uh we've done a lot of tests

1014
00:41:27,059 --> 00:41:29,880
comparing

1015
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:32,160
um you know side by sides with various

1016
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:35,280
fertilizers various composts

1017
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:38,279
um uh with and without

1018
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:40,019
um regen and we've seen yield

1019
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:43,619
improvements for plants treated with

1020
00:41:40,019 --> 00:41:45,119
regen in the range of 16 to 35 percent

1021
00:41:43,619 --> 00:41:46,858
on average

1022
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:49,680
including some tests that we've done

1023
00:41:46,858 --> 00:41:52,980
with some some really strong living soil

1024
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:55,500
grows around the country

1025
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:57,838
um to your to your earlier Point ad

1026
00:41:55,500 --> 00:42:01,139
there are sort of some

1027
00:41:57,838 --> 00:42:04,078
some regulatory dynamics that vary from

1028
00:42:01,139 --> 00:42:06,480
state to state some states may be more

1029
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:09,180
or less open to the idea of on-site

1030
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,900
recycling of stocks and leaves

1031
00:42:09,179 --> 00:42:13,139
um

1032
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:15,480
but in a scenario where where the you

1033
00:42:13,139 --> 00:42:18,420
know kind of regular regulations are are

1034
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:21,420
open to on-site recycling uh we have

1035
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:23,579
both indoor and outdoor Growers who will

1036
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:25,320
collect their stocks and leaves

1037
00:42:23,579 --> 00:42:29,940
um you know put them in Super Sacks or

1038
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:32,519
or into piles apply Regen to the top uh

1039
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:34,920
you know mix that up a little bit

1040
00:42:32,519 --> 00:42:37,320
um you know more mixing can lead to more

1041
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:39,260
complete breakdown it's not required but

1042
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:41,760
it can make things go a little faster

1043
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:43,859
those lead integrating microbes tend to

1044
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:46,980
Like Oxygen

1045
00:42:43,858 --> 00:42:51,598
um but uh that recycled organic matter

1046
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:54,358
can then be applied back into the soil

1047
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:56,940
um you know mixed in as an amendment or

1048
00:42:54,358 --> 00:42:59,098
used as a top dressing we've also found

1049
00:42:56,940 --> 00:43:02,579
that particularly in the top dressing

1050
00:42:59,099 --> 00:43:06,180
application the water consumption

1051
00:43:02,579 --> 00:43:07,980
requirements go down generally as you

1052
00:43:06,179 --> 00:43:10,379
know you know mulch has a lot of strong

1053
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:13,318
benefits for that and the regen recycled

1054
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:15,599
biomasses and especially nutrient and

1055
00:43:13,318 --> 00:43:18,480
microbial Rich sort of mulch or

1056
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:21,660
Amendment so those are the different

1057
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:23,699
applications that we we see there and

1058
00:43:21,659 --> 00:43:24,659
then you know we've also done a lot of

1059
00:43:23,699 --> 00:43:28,379
work

1060
00:43:24,659 --> 00:43:31,940
on corn farms and in forage crops

1061
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:34,740
um spraying uh regen into the fields

1062
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:37,318
allowing those microbes to do their

1063
00:43:34,739 --> 00:43:39,899
their work to break down the residual

1064
00:43:37,318 --> 00:43:41,279
plant matter into nutrients for the next

1065
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:43,019
cycle

1066
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:46,319
um and that can also be done you know at

1067
00:43:43,019 --> 00:43:48,300
small scales on on leaves and backyards

1068
00:43:46,318 --> 00:43:49,800
um again we're really big on this idea

1069
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:53,099
that there's no such thing as plant

1070
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:55,800
waste and regen we see as a as a wave

1071
00:43:53,099 --> 00:43:58,318
for people to kind of you know recognize

1072
00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:01,500
that and make it easy to get all the

1073
00:43:58,318 --> 00:44:03,239
benefits back from something that in

1074
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:05,760
some instances they may be paying to get

1075
00:44:03,239 --> 00:44:08,639
rid of yeah I love the idea of using it

1076
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:11,579
for like silage or plant matter that's

1077
00:44:08,639 --> 00:44:13,019
in left out in the fields agricultural

1078
00:44:11,579 --> 00:44:15,300
to break it down faster for the next

1079
00:44:13,019 --> 00:44:16,559
cycle or maybe breaking down a cover

1080
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:18,539
crop

1081
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:19,920
after it's been after cutting or things

1082
00:44:18,539 --> 00:44:23,699
like that

1083
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:26,000
um I do struggle with and talk to me

1084
00:44:23,699 --> 00:44:28,919
about this

1085
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:31,199
recycling plant matter in and out of the

1086
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:33,240
facility raises the risks of pests and

1087
00:44:31,199 --> 00:44:34,799
pathogens in you know controlled

1088
00:44:33,239 --> 00:44:37,799
environment agriculture which is what a

1089
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:40,740
lot of our Growers are are doing now

1090
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:42,000
granted with living soil and and such we

1091
00:44:40,739 --> 00:44:44,578
do give up a little bit of control

1092
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,019
already by recognizing that there's

1093
00:44:44,579 --> 00:44:48,480
going to be microbes in our facility

1094
00:44:46,019 --> 00:44:49,679
there's going to be beneficial insects

1095
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:52,260
and things like that but we're still

1096
00:44:49,679 --> 00:44:55,259
trying to avoid pests and pathogens how

1097
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:58,619
does region impact

1098
00:44:55,260 --> 00:45:00,300
um impact those risks or do you how do

1099
00:44:58,619 --> 00:45:02,640
you how do you see it playing a role in

1100
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:05,220
a situation for sure it's it's a it's a

1101
00:45:02,639 --> 00:45:07,559
great question and before I kind of

1102
00:45:05,219 --> 00:45:09,299
answer it I'll just say I I think Dad

1103
00:45:07,559 --> 00:45:10,920
you know in the way that we did with

1104
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:13,318
with root we're gonna have to prove it

1105
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:15,539
to you with regen

1106
00:45:13,318 --> 00:45:16,679
um and again very very much appreciate

1107
00:45:15,539 --> 00:45:17,400
that

1108
00:45:16,679 --> 00:45:19,618
um

1109
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:21,780
to your question about pets and pathogen

1110
00:45:19,619 --> 00:45:23,880
risk we of course recognize that that's

1111
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:25,680
a huge consideration for commercial

1112
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:27,780
Growers particularly as you said

1113
00:45:25,679 --> 00:45:29,460
operating in an indoor controlled

1114
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:30,980
environment

1115
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:35,519
um

1116
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:38,400
we were able to generate really strong

1117
00:45:35,519 --> 00:45:41,219
data with with ubm

1118
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:43,079
um both into kind of the the mechanisms

1119
00:45:41,219 --> 00:45:44,639
of of what's going on with the microbes

1120
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:47,400
and also

1121
00:45:44,639 --> 00:45:48,539
um how that translates to interactions

1122
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:52,079
with

1123
00:45:48,539 --> 00:45:53,940
um with different pathogens uh so I'll

1124
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:55,859
kind of point to the research paper that

1125
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:58,380
that Victoria mentioned which which will

1126
00:45:55,858 --> 00:45:59,420
be published soon

1127
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:04,380
um

1128
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:06,000
UVM performed uh side by side they

1129
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:07,980
performed uh what's referred to as a

1130
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:12,719
plate competition assay

1131
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:14,818
in which a pathogen is grown on a plate

1132
00:46:12,719 --> 00:46:17,219
um and then you kind of do something to

1133
00:46:14,818 --> 00:46:19,559
the plate to see whether the growth of

1134
00:46:17,219 --> 00:46:21,118
that pathogen is impacted

1135
00:46:19,559 --> 00:46:23,338
um in the case of this experiment with

1136
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:26,099
ubm they use the fungal pathogen

1137
00:46:23,338 --> 00:46:28,858
rhizoctonia Solani which is a

1138
00:46:26,099 --> 00:46:31,920
particularly strong fungal pathogen that

1139
00:46:28,858 --> 00:46:34,619
also is used often in academic settings

1140
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:36,358
because uh well one you can grow it on a

1141
00:46:34,619 --> 00:46:37,858
plate and also because it's sort of

1142
00:46:36,358 --> 00:46:42,000
Representative of a bunch of different

1143
00:46:37,858 --> 00:46:45,078
types of pathogens and in that in those

1144
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:48,300
experimental conditions they found that

1145
00:46:45,079 --> 00:46:51,720
putting recycled biomass that had been

1146
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:53,760
treated with regen onto that plate with

1147
00:46:51,719 --> 00:46:56,219
the fungal pathogen prevented that

1148
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:58,260
fungal pathogen from growing there was

1149
00:46:56,219 --> 00:47:01,379
full suppression of the pathogenic

1150
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:03,140
growth in that context

1151
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:05,039
um I'd also mention to your point about

1152
00:47:03,139 --> 00:47:06,779
pests of course you know we think about

1153
00:47:05,039 --> 00:47:09,779
insects that we don't want running

1154
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:12,599
around are flying crawling Etc Around

1155
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:15,540
The Grow rooms

1156
00:47:12,599 --> 00:47:18,900
um one of the particular ego enzymes

1157
00:47:15,539 --> 00:47:21,659
that UVM measured

1158
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:24,480
uh is a is a kite nase

1159
00:47:21,659 --> 00:47:28,980
um uh chitin of course being a component

1160
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:32,400
of insect and insect exoskeletons and uh

1161
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:38,099
regen produces a very significant amount

1162
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:38,760
of a chitin's enzyme nag is the acronym

1163
00:47:38,099 --> 00:47:40,338
um

1164
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:44,040
and

1165
00:47:40,338 --> 00:47:46,858
the presence of that uh Eco enzyme can

1166
00:47:44,039 --> 00:47:50,219
can serve the function of breaking down

1167
00:47:46,858 --> 00:47:53,460
um insects larva uh eggs you know and

1168
00:47:50,219 --> 00:47:55,199
and getting into their exoskeletons okay

1169
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:58,920
so there are some mechanisms that may

1170
00:47:55,199 --> 00:48:00,838
help in reducing some of that risk

1171
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:03,599
um but it is something I think Growers

1172
00:48:00,838 --> 00:48:06,299
may want to be aware of I love the idea

1173
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:08,160
of uh kind of a what Victoria talked

1174
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:10,500
about this idea of sort of recapturing

1175
00:48:08,159 --> 00:48:12,539
and releasing some of these nutrients

1176
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:14,639
that may be tied up in the in the plant

1177
00:48:12,539 --> 00:48:17,338
themselves and just less accessible due

1178
00:48:14,639 --> 00:48:18,900
to the lignin and cellulose

1179
00:48:17,338 --> 00:48:21,659
um

1180
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:25,318
but I do worry about heavy metals

1181
00:48:21,659 --> 00:48:28,519
pathogens pests and and viroids now

1182
00:48:25,318 --> 00:48:31,318
especially with the Hop latent viroid

1183
00:48:28,519 --> 00:48:33,659
as potential concerns but you know over

1184
00:48:31,318 --> 00:48:35,338
time maybe we find with research that in

1185
00:48:33,659 --> 00:48:37,559
a real world facility it's less of a

1186
00:48:35,338 --> 00:48:40,920
concern yeah those are all very real

1187
00:48:37,559 --> 00:48:42,659
concerns to Growers so I hope we can

1188
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:46,559
start to address some of them more with

1189
00:48:42,659 --> 00:48:48,239
the work that we do at Mio and I would

1190
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:51,000
out add that like in an outdoor

1191
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:53,399
situation in a in a greenhouse that

1192
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,619
maybe it has more exposure to outdoor

1193
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:58,139
air and pests and pathogens in general I

1194
00:48:55,619 --> 00:49:00,059
think I I don't I wouldn't associate the

1195
00:48:58,139 --> 00:49:00,779
same level of risk

1196
00:49:00,059 --> 00:49:03,000
um

1197
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:05,579
and in fact I think I could see I could

1198
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,500
see a lot of beneficial use cases

1199
00:49:05,579 --> 00:49:08,160
in those scenarios

1200
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:10,219
um

1201
00:49:08,159 --> 00:49:13,139
but I appreciate the dialogue around it

1202
00:49:10,219 --> 00:49:15,358
because I know it is

1203
00:49:13,139 --> 00:49:17,039
I I think it's important to just have a

1204
00:49:15,358 --> 00:49:19,559
conversation around it um and like at

1205
00:49:17,039 --> 00:49:21,000
least get people thinking about it but

1206
00:49:19,559 --> 00:49:24,000
um

1207
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:26,400
that being said uh is there anything

1208
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,858
else you want to add about root or regen

1209
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:29,460
or the technology itself

1210
00:49:28,858 --> 00:49:32,940
um

1211
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:34,858
before I I cut the show and we cut to Dr

1212
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:37,200
Ben to talk a little bit more about the

1213
00:49:34,858 --> 00:49:39,838
research of gold leaf

1214
00:49:37,199 --> 00:49:42,179
I think that should about Do It

1215
00:49:39,838 --> 00:49:43,619
um you know again appreciate the the

1216
00:49:42,179 --> 00:49:46,440
opportunity to be

1217
00:49:43,619 --> 00:49:48,240
on the podcast with you Chad it's it's

1218
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:50,400
um it's a great you know

opportunity to talk more about fruit and

1232
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:20,339
region and uh you know how they came to

1233
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:23,760
be and and what they could potentially

1234
00:50:20,338 --> 00:50:26,719
do for Growers so really really great to

[Music]

1252
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:12,000
all right we're back this time with Dr

1253
00:51:09,059 --> 00:51:15,119
Ben Higgins here to talk about some of

1254
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:18,599
the results using the MEO product root

1255
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:19,940
over at Gold Leaf Gardens uh Ben can you

1256
00:51:18,599 --> 00:51:23,280
talk to me about

1257
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:24,300
how you guys set up the experiment yeah

1258
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,800
so

1259
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:28,619
um it was a pretty straightforward

1260
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:31,740
experiment we used cloning domes and we

1261
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:33,200
do have some other Sops associated with

1262
00:51:31,739 --> 00:51:35,519
our cloning

1263
00:51:33,199 --> 00:51:38,338
normally but because we were just really

1264
00:51:35,519 --> 00:51:40,019
interested in how uh the immuno route

1265
00:51:38,338 --> 00:51:41,000
performed against the kind of leading

1266
00:51:40,019 --> 00:51:43,318
competitor

1267
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:45,599
we held off on all those things so this

1268
00:51:43,318 --> 00:51:47,219
was basically just a plain water and the

1269
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:50,338
rooting hormone trial

1270
00:51:47,219 --> 00:51:50,939
and what we found is pretty encouraging

1271
00:51:50,338 --> 00:51:54,299
um

1272
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:57,119
uh survival rate was uh not

1273
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:58,859
significantly better but that was great

1274
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:01,559
because we were still hovering around 80

1275
00:51:58,858 --> 00:52:03,779
to 85 percent so we didn't see a

1276
00:52:01,559 --> 00:52:05,819
decrease in using the emio root which is

1277
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:09,720
something we obviously were very um

1278
00:52:05,818 --> 00:52:11,880
cognizant of and after that the thing

1279
00:52:09,719 --> 00:52:14,939
the main thing we're really tracking

1280
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:17,579
um that we were able to track was uh

1281
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:20,940
clone just growth so we just looked at

1282
00:52:17,579 --> 00:52:22,980
clone height so all we did was basically

1283
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:25,318
um the day that those clones went into

1284
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:28,139
the plugs I just took a height

1285
00:52:25,318 --> 00:52:30,480
measurement and I went from the base of

1286
00:52:28,139 --> 00:52:32,400
the plant where it you know intersected

1287
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,960
the plug all the way up to that apical

1288
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:36,539
node

1289
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:38,338
um over time I've started to use that

1290
00:52:36,539 --> 00:52:40,500
kind of as my height measurement because

1291
00:52:38,338 --> 00:52:41,880
you know fan leaves can go up and down

1292
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:43,858
and they're bigger or smaller depending

1293
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:46,440
on cultivar so really just kind of

1294
00:52:43,858 --> 00:52:48,539
keeping a standard reference point that

1295
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:50,338
top apical node

1296
00:52:48,539 --> 00:52:51,960
um standardized things pretty well so I

1297
00:52:50,338 --> 00:52:53,818
went from that and then we just

1298
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:56,280
basically gave them a hand watering when

1299
00:52:53,818 --> 00:52:58,619
they needed them a misting left them in

1300
00:52:56,280 --> 00:53:00,300
a controlled environment the Dome

1301
00:52:58,619 --> 00:53:03,180
um kind of standard protocol

1302
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:04,980
and after 10 days I popped the lid off

1303
00:53:03,179 --> 00:53:06,299
and just wanted to get an idea of you

1304
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:08,940
know if we were seeing any better

1305
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:10,740
performance and growth and

1306
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:13,019
um to set this up we always try to

1307
00:53:10,739 --> 00:53:15,598
conclude at least two if not more

1308
00:53:13,019 --> 00:53:18,239
cultivars it's kind of um you know

1309
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:19,980
production dependent

1310
00:53:18,239 --> 00:53:22,679
um so we had two cultivars we had the

1311
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:24,780
first one was uh called lemon mimosa and

1312
00:53:22,679 --> 00:53:28,199
the second was called hat trick

1313
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:30,859
and after 10 days we actually did find

1314
00:53:28,199 --> 00:53:34,379
significance in lemon Mimosa the average

1315
00:53:30,858 --> 00:53:35,519
uh increase in height was about 2.8

1316
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:39,599
centimeters

1317
00:53:35,519 --> 00:53:41,338
whereas for the uh the synthetic rooting

1318
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:44,160
hormone we only had an increase of about

1319
00:53:41,338 --> 00:53:46,619
0.73 centimeters so that was a

1320
00:53:44,159 --> 00:53:47,879
significant difference

1321
00:53:46,619 --> 00:53:49,440
um

1322
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:51,480
the

1323
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:54,659
then just confirmed what was the

1324
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:58,559
synthetic uh product that you were using

1325
00:53:54,659 --> 00:54:01,858
uh we were using clonex gel okay okay so

1326
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:05,220
this was rude in comparison clonex great

1327
00:54:01,858 --> 00:54:07,500
yeah and then so the second cultivar hat

1328
00:54:05,219 --> 00:54:08,759
trick uh same thing same protocol same

1329
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:12,179
measuring

1330
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:15,000
um techniques and after 10 days we did

1331
00:54:12,179 --> 00:54:16,799
not see a standards a significant

1332
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:19,139
difference between clones

1333
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:24,480
um between treatments I'm sorry the mean

1334
00:54:19,139 --> 00:54:26,639
change for emio root was 0.95

1335
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:30,000
um centimeters better whereas that for

1336
00:54:26,639 --> 00:54:32,159
clonex was 0.92 so better but not

1337
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,300
statistically better

1338
00:54:32,159 --> 00:54:35,639
um

1339
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:38,760
the thing that we're also very excited

1340
00:54:35,639 --> 00:54:40,858
about was we didn't see it any worse

1341
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:42,599
than clonex and that was kind of The

1342
00:54:40,858 --> 00:54:44,639
Benchmark for us to be willing to accept

1343
00:54:42,599 --> 00:54:46,500
it into our

1344
00:54:44,639 --> 00:54:49,440
um program which is as long as it held

1345
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:51,838
its own or did better than we were we

1346
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:53,700
were happy with it so

1347
00:54:51,838 --> 00:54:56,039
um that was just kind of the tip though

1348
00:54:53,699 --> 00:54:58,019
uh after that

1349
00:54:56,039 --> 00:55:02,099
um obviously we

1350
00:54:58,019 --> 00:55:03,900
I I tried to get a couple of more

1351
00:55:02,099 --> 00:55:04,800
uh what's the best way to say this a

1352
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:05,519
couple of

1353
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:08,760
um

1354
00:55:05,519 --> 00:55:10,259
more direct comparisons to see how emeo

1355
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:11,880
root was performing and I was really

1356
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:14,700
focused on the roots

1357
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:17,818
I tried weighing out the P plugs prior

1358
00:55:14,699 --> 00:55:19,799
and then cut the tip cut the the Clone

1359
00:55:17,818 --> 00:55:23,159
off at the base so I was just left with

1360
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:25,380
the root mass and the p-plug obviously

1361
00:55:23,159 --> 00:55:27,960
but there was still so much variation in

1362
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:30,720
just how much moisture those peat plugs

1363
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:32,579
held onto that I didn't feel like I

1364
00:55:30,719 --> 00:55:34,500
could get a very clear signal as to if

1365
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:36,839
the change in weight I was seeing was

1366
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:39,179
actually added root mass or if it was

1367
00:55:36,838 --> 00:55:41,639
just because the that particular plug

1368
00:55:39,179 --> 00:55:42,779
held on to more water so I didn't go

1369
00:55:41,639 --> 00:55:44,578
with that

1370
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:46,800
um but

1371
00:55:44,579 --> 00:55:49,559
because of the serial sacrifice meaning

1372
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:52,318
that I purposely killed clones to get at

1373
00:55:49,559 --> 00:55:53,220
that question I wasn't able to take as

1374
00:55:52,318 --> 00:55:54,900
many

1375
00:55:53,219 --> 00:55:56,459
um replicates forward into production

1376
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:59,039
that I wanted to

1377
00:55:56,460 --> 00:56:01,318
so we because we saw the really nice

1378
00:55:59,039 --> 00:56:03,480
success rate and the the promising

1379
00:56:01,318 --> 00:56:07,739
growth we then

1380
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:10,800
did it again on two other cultivars

1381
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:12,598
um that are now oh gosh only about a

1382
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:14,818
week away from Harvest

1383
00:56:12,599 --> 00:56:16,619
and so those went the full cycle so then

1384
00:56:14,818 --> 00:56:20,699
we'll get a really nice sense to see if

1385
00:56:16,619 --> 00:56:21,300
we are getting any of these early onset

1386
00:56:20,699 --> 00:56:24,000
um

1387
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:26,700
kind of does growing you know is the

1388
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:29,280
relationship between the plant and immo

1389
00:56:26,699 --> 00:56:31,019
uh the increase in growth does that

1390
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:32,579
translate to obviously the the thing

1391
00:56:31,019 --> 00:56:34,159
that most Growers care about which is

1392
00:56:32,579 --> 00:56:36,900
you know does increase Bud production

1393
00:56:34,159 --> 00:56:38,639
but weight uh dry weight and all that

1394
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:40,260
fun stuff so

1395
00:56:38,639 --> 00:56:42,779
stay tuned for that that should be

1396
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:45,300
coming within the next couple weeks yeah

1397
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:49,920
yeah so so the hypothesis then is that

1398
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:52,559
the uh because emeo is the root product

1399
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:54,599
is a microbial product we may get some

1400
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:57,680
microbial persistence that can last

1401
00:56:54,599 --> 00:57:01,440
beyond just the

1402
00:56:57,679 --> 00:57:04,139
propagation stage and into

1403
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:06,179
into veg and potentially into flower so

1404
00:57:04,139 --> 00:57:07,920
we can get to flower Faster by

1405
00:57:06,179 --> 00:57:10,318
shortening the veg stage possibly and

1406
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:12,119
then also get increased

1407
00:57:10,318 --> 00:57:14,338
um you know yields overall it's really

1408
00:57:12,119 --> 00:57:15,599
the right really goal there there's a

1409
00:57:14,338 --> 00:57:18,779
bunch of knock-on effects from that

1410
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:20,039
right so if if you manage to get your

1411
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:22,800
plants

1412
00:57:20,039 --> 00:57:24,179
um your clones to a a certain threshold

1413
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:26,339
height whatever

1414
00:57:24,179 --> 00:57:28,318
you know facility or grower feels that

1415
00:57:26,338 --> 00:57:30,358
whatever that height may be but if you

1416
00:57:28,318 --> 00:57:32,400
can get there faster

1417
00:57:30,358 --> 00:57:34,558
without obviously sacrificing anything

1418
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:37,318
else down the road

1419
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:39,000
um the big obviously business side of

1420
00:57:37,318 --> 00:57:41,940
that is you can maybe squeeze in one

1421
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:43,920
maybe even two more harvests per year

1422
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:45,720
because you are decreasing that veg time

1423
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:46,980
so you can flip the flower quicker you

1424
00:57:45,719 --> 00:57:48,480
could Harvest quicker and then maybe

1425
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:51,300
depending on your production schedule

1426
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:53,880
get in a yield or a harvest or two more

1427
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:55,800
so that in itself uh obviously if you

1428
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:59,579
were to Crunch the numbers would be a

1429
00:57:55,800 --> 00:58:01,800
pretty impactful uh change in production

1430
00:57:59,579 --> 00:58:03,240
and then yeah exactly for the microbial

1431
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:05,519
perspective

1432
00:58:03,239 --> 00:58:07,500
um you know we we want these plants to

1433
00:58:05,519 --> 00:58:10,199
hit the ground running as fast as they

1434
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:12,480
can and the lag between when you

1435
00:58:10,199 --> 00:58:15,598
transplant from a somewhat sterile or

1436
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:18,619
synthetic environment into you know what

1437
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:22,260
we do which is the organic living soil

1438
00:58:18,619 --> 00:58:25,079
you know we don't know how fast it takes

1439
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:27,240
for those symbioses to develop

1440
00:58:25,079 --> 00:58:30,480
um we don't know how long it takes for

1441
00:58:27,239 --> 00:58:32,399
that bulk flow signaling between the

1442
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:35,159
plant root exudates and the microbes and

1443
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:36,838
the in the already present in the in the

1444
00:58:35,159 --> 00:58:38,399
soil to you know what how long does it

1445
00:58:36,838 --> 00:58:42,358
take for them to make that handshake so

1446
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:45,599
if you can get that process started

1447
00:58:42,358 --> 00:58:47,880
um earlier on I feel like you're you're

1448
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:49,619
helping out with not having such a lag

1449
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:51,660
time between that

1450
00:58:49,619 --> 00:58:54,358
and

1451
00:58:51,659 --> 00:58:55,858
um it could very well easily I mean this

1452
00:58:54,358 --> 00:58:57,900
is all stuff that of course I'd love to

1453
00:58:55,858 --> 00:59:00,539
be able to get at with a compound scope

1454
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:03,059
and actually see these things but it's a

1455
00:59:00,539 --> 00:59:04,679
tricky thing to do but just to see the

1456
00:59:03,059 --> 00:59:07,140
plants kind of take off a little bit

1457
00:59:04,679 --> 00:59:09,598
more uh quickly

1458
00:59:07,139 --> 00:59:11,279
um if you do manage to get more

1459
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:13,798
um instead of just that one big apical

1460
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:15,480
growth if you get more branching and

1461
00:59:13,798 --> 00:59:17,818
those things are you know keeping up a

1462
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:20,039
little bit more there's other kind of

1463
00:59:17,818 --> 00:59:23,400
signals we're going to try to you know

1464
00:59:20,039 --> 00:59:27,119
see if if this you know relationship

1465
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:29,338
between early root colonizing by organic

1466
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:32,099
microbial Community pays off down the

1467
00:59:29,338 --> 00:59:34,679
road versus just a synthetic molecule

1468
00:59:32,099 --> 00:59:36,720
that kind of thinks makes the plant do

1469
00:59:34,679 --> 00:59:38,759
this rooting thing

1470
00:59:36,719 --> 00:59:41,219
um and then it's kind of just left in a

1471
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:44,220
sterile environment to then go seek out

1472
00:59:41,219 --> 00:59:48,598
those kind of organic relationships

1473
00:59:44,219 --> 00:59:51,358
now Ben did you measure the overall

1474
00:59:48,599 --> 00:59:54,480
growth through veg to see if you did get

1475
00:59:51,358 --> 00:59:57,000
increased growth in the MEO plants

1476
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:58,740
versus the uh yeah we did I guess the

1477
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,780
clonex one yeah so we saw it for that

1478
00:59:58,739 --> 01:00:02,179
first 10 days those were the

1479
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:04,079
um the statistically different

1480
01:00:02,179 --> 01:00:07,259
statistically different significant

1481
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:10,079
results that we saw for lemon mimosa

1482
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:12,299
we didn't see it again in hat trick but

1483
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:13,380
we we continued to track the growth and

1484
01:00:12,298 --> 01:00:17,519
those

1485
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:19,500
um that pace stayed constant so in fact

1486
01:00:17,519 --> 01:00:22,559
for lemon Mimosa which was the one that

1487
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:24,719
we saw that big jump in height uh Emil

1488
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:25,740
relative to clonex

1489
01:00:24,719 --> 01:00:27,959
um

1490
01:00:25,739 --> 01:00:30,539
just by sheer Randomness the Clones

1491
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:32,460
actually started for the the MEO

1492
01:00:30,539 --> 01:00:34,980
treatment they stored they started out a

1493
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:37,679
little bit shorter than the ones did for

1494
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:41,519
clonex but after 10 days those totally

1495
01:00:37,679 --> 01:00:44,399
switched so you had you know the amino

1496
01:00:41,519 --> 01:00:46,739
clones were were bigger and then we

1497
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:49,019
tracked that for another 10 to 12 days

1498
01:00:46,739 --> 01:00:50,818
you know weekends kind of throw off

1499
01:00:49,019 --> 01:00:52,318
production Cycles a little bit for us

1500
01:00:50,818 --> 01:00:54,838
but

1501
01:00:52,318 --> 01:00:57,420
um right the next time we were able to

1502
01:00:54,838 --> 01:01:00,599
transplant into our beds to flower we we

1503
01:00:57,420 --> 01:01:02,818
took a point there and also looked at uh

1504
01:01:00,599 --> 01:01:05,039
you know vegetative growth performance

1505
01:01:02,818 --> 01:01:07,440
to make sure that pattern stayed

1506
01:01:05,039 --> 01:01:09,420
constant and it did so it didn't seem

1507
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:12,599
like it was just this big bump and then

1508
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:15,059
kind of level off it continued to Rise

1509
01:01:12,599 --> 01:01:19,920
um especially relative to the clonex

1510
01:01:15,059 --> 01:01:22,380
trial that did hold true for hat-trick

1511
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:24,119
as well in that once they were on a

1512
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:27,720
growth trajectory it didn't really

1513
01:01:24,119 --> 01:01:30,000
change too much so it kind of lends a

1514
01:01:27,719 --> 01:01:31,858
little bit of uh Credence to the whole

1515
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,719
if you can get them jumped quickly they

1516
01:01:31,858 --> 01:01:35,759
kind of take off on that obviously

1517
01:01:33,719 --> 01:01:37,199
unless there's a hiccup in you know

1518
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:39,240
nutrients or if they're running out of

1519
01:01:37,199 --> 01:01:41,939
gas or anything like that but if if

1520
01:01:39,239 --> 01:01:44,759
everything's there and they do have a

1521
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:47,099
good jump start they tend to continue to

1522
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:48,780
stay on that trajectory we don't see any

1523
01:01:47,099 --> 01:01:51,359
fall off yet and we certainly haven't

1524
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:53,220
seen any going into flower I'd be very

1525
01:01:51,358 --> 01:01:54,900
I'm very anxious in the next week when

1526
01:01:53,219 --> 01:01:57,118
we bring that room down

1527
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:59,760
um the plan there is just to take each

1528
01:01:57,119 --> 01:02:01,920
plant individually wait individually tag

1529
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:04,020
them individually and then that way

1530
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:05,818
we'll be able to know like you know

1531
01:02:04,019 --> 01:02:06,619
here's the overall plant height at the

1532
01:02:05,818 --> 01:02:09,298
end

1533
01:02:06,619 --> 01:02:10,680
here's the wet weight for that plant and

1534
01:02:09,298 --> 01:02:12,420
then we'll track that all the way

1535
01:02:10,679 --> 01:02:14,699
through to dry weight and then we'll

1536
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:15,838
have a a metric at the end which is you

1537
01:02:14,699 --> 01:02:19,019
know how much

1538
01:02:15,838 --> 01:02:20,759
flour or jarable product did this one

1539
01:02:19,019 --> 01:02:21,798
plant give us relative to the other

1540
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:24,299
treatment

1541
01:02:21,798 --> 01:02:26,159
that we did all the way back you know

1542
01:02:24,298 --> 01:02:27,960
three plus months ago yeah and I think

1543
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:30,719
the main goal of this is just I mean

1544
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:34,199
initially was just to have a an organic

1545
01:02:30,719 --> 01:02:36,838
option right that is consistent and can

1546
01:02:34,199 --> 01:02:38,519
match or you know really just match with

1547
01:02:36,838 --> 01:02:39,239
what we're getting with clonex and these

1548
01:02:38,519 --> 01:02:41,159
other

1549
01:02:39,239 --> 01:02:43,558
um you know

1550
01:02:41,159 --> 01:02:45,480
and synthetic products so the fact that

1551
01:02:43,559 --> 01:02:47,400
it's it seems to be doing so is I would

1552
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:50,159
call it a win and then in all this extra

1553
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:52,019
stuff with you know potentially uh

1554
01:02:50,159 --> 01:02:55,199
better growth

1555
01:02:52,019 --> 01:02:56,159
um yeah potential disease protection uh

1556
01:02:55,199 --> 01:02:57,659
some of these things that they're

1557
01:02:56,159 --> 01:03:00,899
they're starting to see I think is

1558
01:02:57,659 --> 01:03:04,259
really exciting yeah and you know as a

1559
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:05,400
you know scientist or nerd every slice

1560
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:07,200
it

1561
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:08,760
um it opens a bunch of really quick

1562
01:03:07,199 --> 01:03:11,460
interesting questions right because

1563
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:13,500
obviously as a grower you want you know

1564
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:16,619
you'd love it if hat trick had the same

1565
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:19,139
performance as lemon Mimosa which was

1566
01:03:16,619 --> 01:03:21,119
this thing just exploded you know

1567
01:03:19,139 --> 01:03:24,179
relative to clonex but it didn't

1568
01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:26,519
but I think the the thing too and maybe

1569
01:03:24,179 --> 01:03:28,440
just kind of a more General uh thing for

1570
01:03:26,519 --> 01:03:29,880
Growers to remember is you know just

1571
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:31,318
because you didn't get the result you

1572
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:33,960
were expecting didn't doesn't mean you

1573
01:03:31,318 --> 01:03:35,219
didn't get a result right so you know

1574
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:36,659
now we have this kind of really

1575
01:03:35,219 --> 01:03:39,179
interesting thing where it's like well

1576
01:03:36,659 --> 01:03:40,980
lemon Mimosa played very nicely with

1577
01:03:39,179 --> 01:03:43,500
Vimeo

1578
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:45,599
um and hat-trick not so much so the

1579
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:48,838
question now is very exciting which is

1580
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:51,119
well why is that right so then it it it

1581
01:03:48,838 --> 01:03:52,920
challenges you and it focuses you to

1582
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:54,298
maybe think about other aspects of your

1583
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:56,099
grow

1584
01:03:54,298 --> 01:03:58,079
um or what was you know was one bed

1585
01:03:56,099 --> 01:04:00,838
mixed differently or you know what what

1586
01:03:58,079 --> 01:04:03,000
can I control to maybe help explain why

1587
01:04:00,838 --> 01:04:04,920
we saw this result as long as you're

1588
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:06,179
critically thinking about unexpected

1589
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:08,280
results

1590
01:04:06,179 --> 01:04:10,618
um there's a lot of potential for growth

1591
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:12,180
there no pun intended

1592
01:04:10,619 --> 01:04:14,220
um so it's just something for I think

1593
01:04:12,179 --> 01:04:17,159
Growers to keep in mind which is you

1594
01:04:14,219 --> 01:04:20,159
know if if if things don't go if your

1595
01:04:17,159 --> 01:04:23,039
hypothesis is not supported fully that's

1596
01:04:20,159 --> 01:04:24,899
still a result that I think is merited

1597
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:28,199
um at least a couple of thoughts in a

1598
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:30,298
conversation as to why and I know in a

1599
01:04:28,199 --> 01:04:32,818
production facility getting at the Y and

1600
01:04:30,298 --> 01:04:37,318
the how tends to not be

1601
01:04:32,818 --> 01:04:38,759
the most important pathway because it

1602
01:04:37,318 --> 01:04:41,219
doesn't it doesn't really necessarily

1603
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:43,680
lead to additional Revenue right and

1604
01:04:41,219 --> 01:04:46,199
this is all obviously a business that

1605
01:04:43,679 --> 01:04:49,019
we're going for here but on occasionally

1606
01:04:46,199 --> 01:04:50,818
the why can be more Universal and then

1607
01:04:49,019 --> 01:04:53,039
apply it to other things that might be

1608
01:04:50,818 --> 01:04:57,000
limiting growth right so

1609
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:58,440
just keep things flowing uh critically

1610
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:01,199
thinking

1611
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:03,780
um it's a really really important tool

1612
01:05:01,199 --> 01:05:04,798
and a lot of a lot of benefits can come

1613
01:05:03,780 --> 01:05:06,420
from it

1614
01:05:04,798 --> 01:05:08,460
yeah and the last thing that I want to

1615
01:05:06,420 --> 01:05:13,318
mention before we sign off is that

1616
01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:16,679
um not every product or method or

1617
01:05:13,318 --> 01:05:18,420
technique that we try out uh gives us a

1618
01:05:16,679 --> 01:05:20,098
successful result we've tried a lot of

1619
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:24,298
products over the years through gold

1620
01:05:20,099 --> 01:05:27,359
leaf and many of them uh performed uh

1621
01:05:24,298 --> 01:05:28,798
below what you know the the state of the

1622
01:05:27,358 --> 01:05:31,139
control was which is essentially what

1623
01:05:28,798 --> 01:05:33,539
Gold Leaf was already doing so

1624
01:05:31,139 --> 01:05:35,639
uh I think I think we've come a long way

1625
01:05:33,539 --> 01:05:38,400
in your your initial podcast I did with

1626
01:05:35,639 --> 01:05:39,779
you a while back showed just how much uh

1627
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:42,240
you were able to make improvements just

1628
01:05:39,780 --> 01:05:43,559
by running some of these trials yeah but

1629
01:05:42,239 --> 01:05:45,058
um yeah I do want to highlight like

1630
01:05:43,559 --> 01:05:47,040
we've tried other

1631
01:05:45,059 --> 01:05:49,380
microbial products in the past we tried

1632
01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:51,179
this one really cool sounding archaea

1633
01:05:49,380 --> 01:05:53,400
product where the trial just kind of

1634
01:05:51,179 --> 01:05:55,078
fell apart we tried other things on the

1635
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:56,280
microbial side where we just didn't get

1636
01:05:55,079 --> 01:05:57,720
a noticeable

1637
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:59,339
result

1638
01:05:57,719 --> 01:06:01,078
um so

1639
01:05:59,338 --> 01:06:03,980
yeah I think it's an important thing

1640
01:06:01,079 --> 01:06:07,019
yeah it's a really great point and

1641
01:06:03,980 --> 01:06:09,539
the the way I kind of couch all of that

1642
01:06:07,019 --> 01:06:11,940
like well this work this didn't

1643
01:06:09,539 --> 01:06:14,940
um you know but it it shoot maybe it did

1644
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:17,159
for another facility right I mean the

1645
01:06:14,940 --> 01:06:19,260
thing to remember here is that you know

1646
01:06:17,159 --> 01:06:20,818
we we focus very heavily on just

1647
01:06:19,260 --> 01:06:22,319
cannabis because that's obviously what

1648
01:06:20,818 --> 01:06:24,420
we sell that's what people take pictures

1649
01:06:22,318 --> 01:06:27,239
of that's you know

1650
01:06:24,420 --> 01:06:28,200
the main species we're targeting in all

1651
01:06:27,239 --> 01:06:30,118
of this

1652
01:06:28,199 --> 01:06:33,179
but when we're talking about living soil

1653
01:06:30,119 --> 01:06:34,980
and microbial communities I mean

1654
01:06:33,179 --> 01:06:36,598
Ted do you want to take a guess at how

1655
01:06:34,980 --> 01:06:39,719
many different microbial populations or

1656
01:06:36,599 --> 01:06:42,059
any given bed because I don't yeah

1657
01:06:39,719 --> 01:06:44,038
um you know it's large it's a lot so

1658
01:06:42,059 --> 01:06:46,019
you're you're managing quite a lot of

1659
01:06:44,039 --> 01:06:49,140
relationships and these relationships

1660
01:06:46,019 --> 01:06:51,599
are evolving over time right so

1661
01:06:49,139 --> 01:06:53,759
you put emio root in at the beginning of

1662
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:55,559
a cloning round it's going to interact

1663
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:58,980
with a host of other different

1664
01:06:55,559 --> 01:07:01,019
populations all given a specific

1665
01:06:58,980 --> 01:07:03,358
environment and I mean one of the best

1666
01:07:01,019 --> 01:07:05,099
ways that I've always liked to explain

1667
01:07:03,358 --> 01:07:07,078
this is

1668
01:07:05,099 --> 01:07:09,240
uh you know the two famous tennis

1669
01:07:07,079 --> 01:07:10,980
players right Roger Federer and Rafael

1670
01:07:09,239 --> 01:07:14,159
Nadal

1671
01:07:10,980 --> 01:07:18,298
um they're legendary and one of them

1672
01:07:14,159 --> 01:07:21,779
Nadal was an absolute monster on Clay

1673
01:07:18,298 --> 01:07:23,400
where Federer wasn't just almost

1674
01:07:21,780 --> 01:07:25,859
unbeatable on grass and then when these

1675
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:28,380
two played each other their record was

1676
01:07:25,858 --> 01:07:30,058
almost purely determined with a handful

1677
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:31,798
of a couple of exceptions but almost

1678
01:07:30,059 --> 01:07:33,539
purely determined

1679
01:07:31,798 --> 01:07:35,519
by the court they were playing on so if

1680
01:07:33,539 --> 01:07:38,160
they're on Clay Nadal would win if

1681
01:07:35,519 --> 01:07:40,199
they're on grass Federer would win

1682
01:07:38,159 --> 01:07:42,358
um in fact they they set this thing up

1683
01:07:40,199 --> 01:07:44,460
because they wanted to take the

1684
01:07:42,358 --> 01:07:47,159
environmental perspective out of it and

1685
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:48,838
they made a tennis court that was half

1686
01:07:47,159 --> 01:07:50,699
clay and half grass so they put Fetter

1687
01:07:48,838 --> 01:07:52,920
on the grass and the doll on clay

1688
01:07:50,699 --> 01:07:54,838
and so it's always a nice reminder to me

1689
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:57,480
that when we set up these experiments in

1690
01:07:54,838 --> 01:07:59,759
these trials that as much as we'd love

1691
01:07:57,480 --> 01:08:02,039
to say this holds true for everything

1692
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:04,980
and sometimes you get lucky and that can

1693
01:08:02,039 --> 01:08:07,680
happen it's rare but it can

1694
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:10,139
the the species that are interacting in

1695
01:08:07,679 --> 01:08:12,000
your soil with the plants are all taking

1696
01:08:10,139 --> 01:08:13,618
place in this backdrop of the

1697
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,539
environment that they're in so you could

1698
01:08:13,619 --> 01:08:17,520
have the exact same genetics the exact

1699
01:08:15,539 --> 01:08:18,659
same microbial populations

1700
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:20,219
but just put them in a different

1701
01:08:18,659 --> 01:08:22,439
environment and those relationships will

1702
01:08:20,219 --> 01:08:26,520
change some antagonistic ones might

1703
01:08:22,439 --> 01:08:28,798
become symbiotic or vice versa so

1704
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:30,359
because stuff isn't working kind of like

1705
01:08:28,798 --> 01:08:31,500
you were speaking to we've tried things

1706
01:08:30,359 --> 01:08:33,600
that haven't worked we've tried things

1707
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:36,119
that haven't worked you keep trying

1708
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:38,880
things and as long as you can set aside

1709
01:08:36,119 --> 01:08:40,979
a couple of beds or pots to just let

1710
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:42,779
those little things

1711
01:08:40,979 --> 01:08:45,718
those little that little subset of your

1712
01:08:42,779 --> 01:08:47,520
grow answer the questions that uh

1713
01:08:45,719 --> 01:08:48,298
Intrigue you

1714
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:50,460
um

1715
01:08:48,298 --> 01:08:52,679
it it you there's a lot of power to that

1716
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:54,960
and you know just going back to that

1717
01:08:52,679 --> 01:08:57,060
tennis example like the environment that

1718
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:59,698
they're in really does set the stage for

1719
01:08:57,060 --> 01:09:01,319
how these things interact so

1720
01:08:59,698 --> 01:09:04,318
um just because a microbial product

1721
01:09:01,319 --> 01:09:05,759
maybe didn't work it it could very well

1722
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:07,440
be that maybe it didn't have anything to

1723
01:09:05,759 --> 01:09:09,179
do with the microbial product at all it

1724
01:09:07,439 --> 01:09:12,479
was just that the VPD was off in the

1725
01:09:09,179 --> 01:09:14,399
room right or it was over watering or

1726
01:09:12,479 --> 01:09:16,139
you know so that's why replication and

1727
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:17,338
trying more than one cultivar you know

1728
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:19,739
these kinds of things are really

1729
01:09:17,338 --> 01:09:21,420
important however they obviously take a

1730
01:09:19,738 --> 01:09:23,338
lot more time so

1731
01:09:21,420 --> 01:09:25,199
there's a trade-off but it's always

1732
01:09:23,338 --> 01:09:26,219
exciting yeah and on the flip side I

1733
01:09:25,198 --> 01:09:28,198
think there's a lot of microbial

1734
01:09:26,219 --> 01:09:30,779
products that frankly just aren't that

1735
01:09:28,198 --> 01:09:33,960
great absolutely and uh that's part of

1736
01:09:30,779 --> 01:09:35,400
the reason it took us over a year to you

1737
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:37,500
know make this podcast to move forward

1738
01:09:35,399 --> 01:09:39,719
with MAO root was because we wanted to

1739
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:41,698
make sure it was something that uh

1740
01:09:39,719 --> 01:09:42,838
we had some data on ourselves in

1741
01:09:41,698 --> 01:09:44,099
addition to the research that they

1742
01:09:42,838 --> 01:09:45,960
shared to know that it's going to be

1743
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:48,480
something that we feel good about

1744
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:51,420
sharing and promoting to

1745
01:09:48,479 --> 01:09:54,379
the community at large so right and for

1746
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:56,699
those that are very much into you know

1747
01:09:54,380 --> 01:09:59,819
organic processes from start to finish

1748
01:09:56,698 --> 01:10:02,698
as we are this this seems to be a really

1749
01:09:59,819 --> 01:10:04,920
a really great alternative to some of

1750
01:10:02,698 --> 01:10:07,919
the you know Common synthetic products

1751
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:09,719
that are out there at least again at

1752
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:12,300
least give it a trial and see you know

1753
01:10:09,719 --> 01:10:14,579
if it does work in your facility

1754
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:16,560
um and you know use your own results to

1755
01:10:14,579 --> 01:10:19,439
to inform if you want to scale it up or

1756
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:21,659
or make any other decisions cool thanks

1757
01:10:19,439 --> 01:10:22,460
for coming on today anytime Todd thanks

1758
