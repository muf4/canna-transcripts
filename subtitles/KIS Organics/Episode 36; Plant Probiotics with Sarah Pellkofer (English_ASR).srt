00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:20,368
welcome to the cannabis cultivation and

3
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,890
science podcast

4
00:00:20,368 --> 00:00:25,259
I'm your host tad hussy of KISS organics

5
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,969
this is the podcast where we discuss the

6
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,099
cutting edge of organic growing from a

7
00:00:26,969 --> 00:00:30,778
science-based perspective and drawn top

8
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:32,189
experts from around the industry to

9
00:00:30,778 --> 00:00:34,259
share their wisdom and knowledge I've

10
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:36,149
got some exciting news to share

11
00:00:34,259 --> 00:00:37,920
I've finally been able to release two

12
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:40,439
white papers that are now available to

13
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,090
read and download on our website the

14
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:44,459
first one looks at a comparison of

15
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,440
living soil methodologies in relation to

16
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,929
plant health and yield in a controlled

17
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:51,149
environment for cannabis in this trial

18
00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:52,799
three different living soil recipes were

19
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:54,808
tested and then put under fluence

20
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:56,849
lighting in a controlled room and yield

21
00:00:54,808 --> 00:00:59,099
was documented the other white paper

22
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,960
looks at a cost analysis of living soil

23
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,609
cultivation at different yields in

24
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,198
comparison to the cost of more

25
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:06,329
conventional methods like followed

26
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:08,009
nutrients or hydroponics we'd love to

27
00:01:06,329 --> 00:01:09,868
get some feedback from growers on these

28
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,939
white papers and hope people will go on

29
00:01:09,868 --> 00:01:13,978
the website and check it out just go to

30
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:16,529
our front page click on blog and it's

31
00:01:13,978 --> 00:01:18,179
the first two articles on there I'm

32
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:20,280
hoping this will spark more discussion

33
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,500
and research into this methodology as a

34
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,509
viable way of cultivating cannabis and

35
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,009
controlled environments and also get

36
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:28,950
some growers to attempt similar

37
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:31,950
experiments to replicate the results now

38
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:34,109
on to the podcast my guest this week is

39
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:36,118
Sarah Pell Cofer Sarah grew up in a

40
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:38,340
small town in Northern California in the

41
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:40,739
olive growing capital of the US she got

42
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,780
her BA in environmental studies from UC

43
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:44,548
Santa Barbara and worked for years for a

44
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,710
private environmental consulting firm

45
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:48,899
writing environmental impact reports and

46
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:51,688
statements and creating remediation

47
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:53,640
plans for Superfund sites she then moved

48
00:01:51,688 --> 00:01:54,929
over to Switzerland to get a master's

49
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,700
degree from the Department of

50
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:58,909
evolutionary biology and environmental

51
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,960
studies at the University of Zurich

52
00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:03,329
studying and publishing work on the

53
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:05,188
importance of urban gardens as habitat

54
00:02:03,328 --> 00:02:07,618
for solitary nesting bees and wasps

55
00:02:05,188 --> 00:02:09,959
while starting a microbrewery to pay for

56
00:02:07,618 --> 00:02:12,419
her tuition after she completed her PhD

57
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,289
in plant science and policy at the

58
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:15,568
University of Missouri

59
00:02:13,289 --> 00:02:18,090
studying plant soil interactions and

60
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:20,369
publishing her own work on solve a

61
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:22,920
diversity and the stability of ecosystem

62
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:24,450
functioning during her PhD she was lucky

63
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:26,128
enough to be able to travel around the

64
00:02:24,449 --> 00:02:27,958
world to share the results of her years

65
00:02:26,128 --> 00:02:30,509
of research with other researchers and

66
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:32,280
scientists Sarah wanted to bring this

67
00:02:30,509 --> 00:02:34,709
knowledge about the crucial state of

68
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,689
soil biodiversity to the public so she

69
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:39,989
left academia and started the company

70
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:41,669
micro culture in Seattle in 2015 under

71
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:44,039
which she designed the microbial

72
00:02:41,669 --> 00:02:45,929
inoculant plant probiotics with the

73
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:47,848
motivation to empower all levels of

74
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:50,430
gardeners to easily start to bring their

75
00:02:47,848 --> 00:02:53,310
own soil back to life now on to the

76
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:54,569
podcast yeah I wanted to talk a little

77
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:58,019
bit about your background you have a

78
00:02:54,568 --> 00:03:01,078
really interesting academic background

79
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:03,480
relating to everything from evolutionary

80
00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:04,950
biology to environmental studies can you

81
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:07,488
just tell me a little bit about about

82
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:09,899
yourself here to start off the podcast

83
00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:10,950
well it took me a while to find in my

84
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,530
direction

85
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:15,598
after I I grew up in Northern California

86
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:17,519
in a small farming town and when I

87
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:20,128
finally went to school I had no idea

88
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,689
what direction I wanted to go but

89
00:03:20,128 --> 00:03:23,128
eventually I was kind of you just went

90
00:03:21,689 --> 00:03:25,739
towards environmental science because I

91
00:03:23,128 --> 00:03:27,418
found that there was just a viewer you

92
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:29,219
we were just seeing so many problems in

93
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:32,489
the world and it seemed like a good way

94
00:03:29,219 --> 00:03:33,750
to try and you know make an impact so I

95
00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:35,819
went to environmental science as an

96
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:38,370
undergrad and I started I was doing like

97
00:03:35,818 --> 00:03:41,878
a geography minor with an environmental

98
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:43,709
science major and from after I graduated

99
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:47,818
with my undergraduate degree I went into

100
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:51,049
environmental consulting and started

101
00:03:47,818 --> 00:03:53,280
working on Superfund sites and doing

102
00:03:51,049 --> 00:03:55,889
environmental impact reports for new

103
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,590
construction sites and it was it was all

104
00:03:55,889 --> 00:04:02,760
pretty it felt like a big Dioner because

105
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:04,769
it was just just a lot of degradation in

106
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:06,179
the environment and I decided but I

107
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:07,769
didn't feel like I was making a big

108
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,760
enough impact so I wanted to go back to

109
00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:13,560
school again and I found a great an

110
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:16,158
evolutionary biology program at the

111
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,538
University of Zurich in Switzerland and

112
00:04:16,158 --> 00:04:21,209
who doesn't want to live in facility so

113
00:04:18,538 --> 00:04:24,750
I decided to go there and started

114
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:26,970
studying wild bees and lost in urban

115
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:31,050
environments and so we were looking

116
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:32,760
how how these they have these these kind

117
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:34,199
of urban gardens there

118
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:36,180
they're like little plots of land that

119
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:37,560
you can rent and have your own little

120
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:39,959
garden in the middle of the city and I

121
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:43,230
was studying how how important these

122
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:46,409
these gardens were for acting as a

123
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:48,420
habitat for for bees and lost and it was

124
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:50,070
pretty cool because we found that these

125
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:51,780
little tiny gardens that didn't seem to

126
00:04:50,069 --> 00:04:53,759
have they weren't actually like a ton of

127
00:04:51,779 --> 00:04:55,199
space they were very very small like

128
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,180
completely surrounded with you know

129
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,889
high-rise buildings and they were

130
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:01,620
actually acting as a really important

131
00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:03,750
habitat for for bees and wasps and they

132
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:07,170
had even more diversity in them of

133
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:09,990
different species than then were out in

134
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:13,890
in agricultural areas so it was a pretty

135
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:15,720
like impactful study in terms of talking

136
00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:18,418
to the city and telling them to kind of

137
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:20,340
preserve these spaces but after that I

138
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:22,979
mean I was spending a lot of time in in

139
00:05:20,339 --> 00:05:25,859
the garden and in these gardens and I

140
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:28,169
was looking at also how the diversity of

141
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:31,230
bees and wasps was also related to the

142
00:05:28,168 --> 00:05:32,819
diversity of what was in the garden so I

143
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:37,020
was looking at a lot of plant stuff and

144
00:05:32,819 --> 00:05:40,159
and as my master's degree finished I got

145
00:05:37,019 --> 00:05:44,609
the opportunity to stay to do a PhD and

146
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:47,010
decided to say for that and ended up

147
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:49,650
studying the biodiversity underground

148
00:05:47,009 --> 00:05:54,029
and how that was related to biodiversity

149
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:56,668
above ground and with my work I was

150
00:05:54,029 --> 00:05:58,679
looking at how slow biodiversity affects

151
00:05:56,668 --> 00:06:01,799
how plants grow and how they function

152
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:04,168
and so we were looking at you know when

153
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:07,310
I say functioning of an ecosystem we're

154
00:06:04,168 --> 00:06:11,990
talking about the carbon sequestration

155
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:14,399
nutrient cycling how like how well the

156
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:17,759
the plants are able to grow like biomass

157
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:18,929
production and decomposition and like

158
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,039
several different functions like

159
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:21,509
basically trying to look at the

160
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:23,390
functionality of the system of the whole

161
00:06:21,509 --> 00:06:27,449
and we called it multi functionality and

162
00:06:23,389 --> 00:06:29,399
we are finding that the more diversity

163
00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:32,879
that you had living in the soil the more

164
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:34,709
diverse excuse me the more the better

165
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:38,788
functioning the above-ground system had

166
00:06:34,709 --> 00:06:40,859
and we also the more novel part of my

167
00:06:38,788 --> 00:06:43,079
studies was that we looked at this

168
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:48,210
stability of that ecosystem functioning

169
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:51,300
and so we were able to find that systems

170
00:06:48,209 --> 00:06:53,908
that had more soil biodiversity actually

171
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:56,310
had the greatest ability in the

172
00:06:53,908 --> 00:07:00,569
ecosystem functioning and so it was kind

173
00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:02,968
of like a really like it was really like

174
00:07:00,569 --> 00:07:04,699
it backed up previous work showing that

175
00:07:02,968 --> 00:07:07,019
that there is this relationship between

176
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:08,939
biodiversity and the functioning of a

177
00:07:07,019 --> 00:07:11,579
system but it also found that that

178
00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:15,210
biodiversity is great for stability and

179
00:07:11,579 --> 00:07:17,579
it really kind of gave like a good a

180
00:07:15,209 --> 00:07:19,318
good background for who are saying that

181
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:21,930
we need to preserve soil biodiversity

182
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:23,610
and it's and it's it is really important

183
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:26,699
for not just you know the underground

184
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:28,348
but the above-ground systems so after

185
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:30,598
like finding all of that stuff out and

186
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:32,699
you know my PhD was coming to a close I

187
00:07:30,598 --> 00:07:35,819
had to figure out do I want to stay in

188
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:37,620
academia and you know keep spreading the

189
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:40,639
word in academia and keep building on

190
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:43,079
this research about soil biodiversity or

191
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:46,228
do I want to go some other direction and

192
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:48,899
I decided but I felt like with my

193
00:07:46,228 --> 00:07:51,060
results it seems you know obvious within

194
00:07:48,899 --> 00:07:52,948
the academic community that this was the

195
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:54,598
way things work but it didn't wasn't

196
00:07:52,949 --> 00:07:57,088
really translated into the public eye

197
00:07:54,598 --> 00:07:59,490
and I figured that you know soil

198
00:07:57,088 --> 00:08:04,949
biodiversity it needs to be preserved

199
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:06,360
but there it wasn't really like there

200
00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:08,069
was it just needed to be told to the

201
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,949
people somehow in a better way because

202
00:08:08,069 --> 00:08:11,759
scientists and and the public just kind

203
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:14,520
of have this lack of communication

204
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:17,520
sometimes so I decided to start a

205
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:20,788
business called micro cultured and I

206
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:22,500
make a microbial inoculant that kind of

207
00:08:20,788 --> 00:08:24,088
gives people an easy way to bring their

208
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:27,449
soil back to life and improve their soil

209
00:08:24,088 --> 00:08:30,658
biodiversity in their backyards and so

210
00:08:27,449 --> 00:08:32,519
it was a major change of hats going from

211
00:08:30,658 --> 00:08:35,218
academia into the public sector but

212
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:39,089
that's kind of a general story of how I

213
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:40,769
got there and I know that's great I it's

214
00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:41,849
wonderful that you're local - I've had

215
00:08:40,769 --> 00:08:43,469
the opportunity to meet with you in

216
00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:45,449
person which was a lot of fun and I know

217
00:08:43,469 --> 00:08:47,730
we've talked off air about quite a bit

218
00:08:45,448 --> 00:08:50,009
of stuff and you really impressed me

219
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:52,528
with your knowledge there's so many of

220
00:08:50,009 --> 00:08:54,480
these microbial based products on the

221
00:08:52,528 --> 00:08:57,740
market now as the industry is

222
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:00,720
realizing the importance of microbes and

223
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:02,399
this this concept of plant probiotics

224
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:07,199
that you're hearing more and more so I

225
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:08,820
really enjoy I really enjoy that I can

226
00:09:07,198 --> 00:09:10,740
you tell me a little bit more before we

227
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:12,720
get into this concept of biodiversity

228
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:14,159
cuz I have some thoughts on that can you

229
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:18,230
tell me a little bit more about what is

230
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:23,549
in your plant pro bat probiotics product

231
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:26,459
well we have when I say we it's me but I

232
00:09:23,549 --> 00:09:28,948
always talk in there the reasons but I

233
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:30,448
have a mixture of just of three

234
00:09:28,948 --> 00:09:33,240
different kinds of bacteria and four

235
00:09:30,448 --> 00:09:35,250
different kinds of listed fungi that

236
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,350
they're the bacteria all they're

237
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:39,240
bacillus species and the Thunderer gloma

238
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:41,970
species and I I came up with this

239
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:44,399
formula because I wanted to make the

240
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:46,620
product kind of universally applicable

241
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,659
to different Gardens and different

242
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:51,690
growing environments and these are

243
00:09:48,659 --> 00:09:53,909
species that my studied in in my

244
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:56,519
graduate work and they always seem to be

245
00:09:53,909 --> 00:09:57,838
present in healthy really healthy

246
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:59,629
systems and they're they're naturally

247
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,550
occurring species if you have a healthy

248
00:09:59,629 --> 00:10:04,828
natural soil like if you go out you know

249
00:10:02,549 --> 00:10:06,750
into any grassland or forest you're

250
00:10:04,828 --> 00:10:08,429
gonna find these species there but there

251
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:11,578
are the species which tend to be lacking

252
00:10:08,429 --> 00:10:15,149
in you know the soils that we process a

253
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:17,309
lot bagged soils yeah if you basically

254
00:10:15,149 --> 00:10:19,919
if you're adding a lot of fertilizer and

255
00:10:17,309 --> 00:10:21,568
chemicals to your soil you're going to

256
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:24,629
be pretty efficiently killing these guys

257
00:10:21,568 --> 00:10:27,659
off but they are the ones that that

258
00:10:24,629 --> 00:10:29,309
really help the plants you know they

259
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:33,360
really form a symbiotic relationship

260
00:10:29,309 --> 00:10:35,698
with the roots of the plants so I have

261
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,039
these different species in the mixture

262
00:10:35,698 --> 00:10:41,818
along with a few starter nutrients of

263
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:44,278
kelp amino and humic acid and those guys

264
00:10:41,818 --> 00:10:46,799
are there to kind of help the kickstart

265
00:10:44,278 --> 00:10:48,720
to get the bacteria and fungi once

266
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:50,578
they're activated because the the

267
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:54,149
product is in a powder form at the dry

268
00:10:50,578 --> 00:10:55,679
powder form and so they're in this

269
00:10:54,149 --> 00:10:58,049
suspended state and then when you add

270
00:10:55,679 --> 00:11:00,088
water to the system they're activated

271
00:10:58,049 --> 00:11:02,609
and then this kelp and amino acid amino

272
00:11:00,089 --> 00:11:04,769
and humic acids come in and kind of give

273
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:07,409
them some food to start out with before

274
00:11:04,769 --> 00:11:08,310
they are able to seek out the plant

275
00:11:07,409 --> 00:11:12,079
roots in a pair of

276
00:11:08,309 --> 00:11:15,089
them yeah now I found out about you from

277
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:17,480
Stephanie down at fire cannabis in

278
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:19,710
Oregon she's been using your product and

279
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:21,240
she's a good friend I love what she's

280
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:24,389
doing down there she's an amazing person

281
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:27,930
I have to give her a shout-out and some

282
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:29,309
credit and so that's sort of how I found

283
00:11:27,929 --> 00:11:31,409
out and then I realized you were local

284
00:11:29,309 --> 00:11:34,769
and you and I had some conversations

285
00:11:31,409 --> 00:11:36,980
offline and you gave me a sample which I

286
00:11:34,769 --> 00:11:40,519
threw under the microscope and tested

287
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:43,259
the problem with these a lot of these

288
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:46,860
like you said suspended microbial

289
00:11:43,259 --> 00:11:48,330
products is there not motile bacteria so

290
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:50,669
they're not very exciting under the

291
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:53,910
microscope but I did see an increase in

292
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:56,399
bacterial biomass over time when I added

293
00:11:53,909 --> 00:11:58,049
distilled water and a food source so I

294
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,269
don't knew there was something alive in

295
00:11:58,049 --> 00:12:01,769
there it just wasn't a lot of fun to

296
00:12:00,269 --> 00:12:04,949
look at under the microscope like some

297
00:12:01,769 --> 00:12:06,870
of the more exciting things like the

298
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:10,500
fungal hyphae and flageolets and in

299
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:14,310
motile bacteria but yeah that was that

300
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:18,120
was great so basically what you did was

301
00:12:14,309 --> 00:12:19,859
you took your background in academia and

302
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,139
looked at the specific species that you

303
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:23,759
had researched or found to be most

304
00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:25,799
effective and then and then put them

305
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:28,830
into this product essentially is what is

306
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:33,179
what I'm getting yeah and I was also I

307
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:35,070
think I was kind of funneled as well by

308
00:12:33,179 --> 00:12:36,809
by the market and availability of

309
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:38,790
different laboratories reliable

310
00:12:36,809 --> 00:12:41,429
laboratories in the United States

311
00:12:38,789 --> 00:12:43,500
because I wanted to have a solid source

312
00:12:41,429 --> 00:12:45,059
I mean there's there are tons of

313
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,190
suppliers out there that can they say

314
00:12:45,059 --> 00:12:49,709
they can give you whatever species you

315
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:54,680
want essentially but a lot of them are

316
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:59,970
overseas and it's just is is yeah I

317
00:12:54,679 --> 00:13:01,889
didn't have a lot of faith in in the the

318
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:05,190
viability of the species that we were

319
00:13:01,889 --> 00:13:06,750
beginning so yeah and I didn't want to

320
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:10,080
like come over on the system as well

321
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:13,830
with too many species so this is just

322
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:16,170
kind of a good start for for the mixture

323
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:17,580
that I have right now yeah I know you're

324
00:13:16,169 --> 00:13:19,079
looking to branch out and you and I

325
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:20,940
talked about some other microbes that

326
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,990
you were excited about hopefully getting

327
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:24,060
into a commercial

328
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:26,310
production with your products down the

329
00:13:24,059 --> 00:13:28,799
road which I love that you're open to

330
00:13:26,309 --> 00:13:31,829
that and it's constantly evolving one

331
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:34,109
other thing though you had mentioned off

332
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:36,000
air that you do some testing back with

333
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:39,330
your old University on the viability of

334
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,839
your product on a fairly regular basis

335
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:45,300
to make sure that you are providing the

336
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:49,260
microbial levels that you're claiming on

337
00:13:45,299 --> 00:13:53,179
the product yeah so I sent some samples

338
00:13:49,259 --> 00:13:55,919
back to Switzerland and I luckily I have

339
00:13:53,179 --> 00:13:57,809
my old colleagues a lot of them are on

340
00:13:55,919 --> 00:14:00,509
my scientific advisory board with

341
00:13:57,809 --> 00:14:02,429
microculture so I get to answer back

342
00:14:00,509 --> 00:14:04,889
with and forth with them about ideas and

343
00:14:02,429 --> 00:14:06,958
just kind of Mayberry have better access

344
00:14:04,889 --> 00:14:08,819
to the current state of the science and

345
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:10,739
so as things are evolving and we're

346
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:13,140
discovering new things which we are all

347
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:15,120
the time because you know sciences or

348
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:18,120
excuse me soil is really like the great

349
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,500
frontier we know so little about it so

350
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,659
it's it's great to have them there like

351
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,490
with their hand and academia and being

352
00:14:21,659 --> 00:14:27,149
able to have access to the journals and

353
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:28,709
all of the current science and so I sent

354
00:14:27,149 --> 00:14:30,839
samples back to them and they've

355
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:34,109
incorporated them into some greenhouse

356
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:36,959
experiments and then they also have you

357
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:40,980
know the DNA extraction laboratory and

358
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:44,069
equipment to do that but I also have

359
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:47,310
contract or I have samples going out to

360
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:50,339
some local labs here in the Pacific

361
00:14:47,309 --> 00:14:52,528
Northwest and they're doing the fungal

362
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:53,790
spore analysis for me and I think it's

363
00:14:52,528 --> 00:14:56,570
really important to kind of just

364
00:14:53,789 --> 00:14:58,559
constantly keep testing your product

365
00:14:56,570 --> 00:15:02,250
because it's just it's a really

366
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:04,500
challenging medium because we can't see

367
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:05,879
we can't see the species either it's

368
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:09,208
really hard to have quality control

369
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:11,639
visibly and so you have to you know send

370
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:14,519
stuff out and you have to pay for it but

371
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:16,828
I think it's important to have have

372
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:18,539
these to be able to know that you have

373
00:15:16,828 --> 00:15:20,250
the viability that is listed on your

374
00:15:18,539 --> 00:15:22,980
product and at least at the minimum

375
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:26,850
concentrations that are that are on the

376
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:29,070
package so it's it's it's yeah it's

377
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:30,180
money out of your pocket but I think in

378
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:31,980
the end you're gonna have a better

379
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:33,828
product that's more reliable that's

380
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:35,550
going to give more reliable results to

381
00:15:33,828 --> 00:15:37,429
your clients

382
00:15:35,549 --> 00:15:40,559
and so I think it's totally worth it

383
00:15:37,429 --> 00:15:43,049
yeah one thing that a lot of growers

384
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:45,569
don't realize is that with microbial

385
00:15:43,049 --> 00:15:47,789
based products you I believe you have to

386
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:49,350
submit an initial test that shows the

387
00:15:47,789 --> 00:15:50,370
concentrations to support what you're

388
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:52,259
putting on your label

389
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:54,629
but beyond that there's there's very

390
00:15:52,259 --> 00:15:56,669
limited testing done by the state to

391
00:15:54,629 --> 00:15:57,960
actually ensure that the levels that

392
00:15:56,669 --> 00:16:00,089
you're claiming on the package are

393
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:01,259
really in the bag and then you don't

394
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:03,990
know how long it's been sitting on a

395
00:16:01,259 --> 00:16:06,569
shelf how it's been stored by whatever

396
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:08,600
company is distributing or selling that

397
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:12,420
product and it gets really really

398
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:13,920
convoluted I would say the only state

399
00:16:12,419 --> 00:16:15,929
that I know that's actually done any of

400
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:19,019
this testing is the Oregon Department of

401
00:16:15,929 --> 00:16:21,079
Agriculture so I suggest if you haven't

402
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:23,699
signed up for their fertilizer and

403
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:26,160
pesticide alerts it's something that

404
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:27,840
everyone should go do it's just a free

405
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:29,909
email service that they provide you just

406
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:32,879
give them your email and there they do

407
00:16:29,909 --> 00:16:34,319
this a study are some testing back in I

408
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:35,820
want to say two thousand fifteen or

409
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,370
sixteen and they found that the levels

410
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:40,410
were quite different based on what the

411
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:41,940
claims were on the bag so just something

412
00:16:40,409 --> 00:16:44,100
for people to be aware of when they're

413
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:46,530
looking at comparing microbial based

414
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:50,279
products yeah I think it's important

415
00:16:46,529 --> 00:16:52,860
that there is there should be you know

416
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:55,289
kind of a shelf-life listed on the

417
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:57,389
product because it's I mean that's just

418
00:16:55,289 --> 00:17:00,569
let's say for the the producer and for

419
00:16:57,389 --> 00:17:02,490
the consumer because yeah Ben because

420
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:04,230
even microbes they want to grow I mean

421
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:06,870
fungi and bacteria they want to grow if

422
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:09,029
they get any access to sugars or if it's

423
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:11,129
a suspended form like what I have in a

424
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:13,349
dry powder farm if it gets access to any

425
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:15,510
kind of moisture there they're gonna

426
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:18,449
grow and things are gonna change and I

427
00:17:15,509 --> 00:17:20,519
mean that's the beauty of fungi and

428
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:22,950
bacteria is it's they're constantly

429
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:24,599
changing evolving but I think if you're

430
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:27,110
going to be selling the products with

431
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:29,309
you know X number species listed X

432
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:33,750
concentrations you have to be able to

433
00:17:29,309 --> 00:17:35,519
kind of stand behind that so yeah I want

434
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:38,789
it I want to kind of change directions

435
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:41,430
here now you'd mentioned biodiversity

436
00:17:38,789 --> 00:17:42,809
early on in our conversation and how

437
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:45,570
that was one of the findings that you've

438
00:17:42,809 --> 00:17:47,639
had in your in your university study and

439
00:17:45,569 --> 00:17:49,339
I haven't actually talked to you about

440
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,380
this yet but I

441
00:17:49,339 --> 00:17:55,309
recently went to Chicago for photo X

442
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:57,230
which is a conference put on by fluence

443
00:17:55,309 --> 00:18:00,200
bioengineering it's it's a lot of fun

444
00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:02,360
and a lot of really good studies are

445
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:04,610
presented there and I hope to share some

446
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:08,329
of that later on but interestingly

447
00:18:04,609 --> 00:18:11,179
enough I'm sitting in on the plane and

448
00:18:08,329 --> 00:18:15,769
this guy next to me is reading a journal

449
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:19,940
article on how how earthworms can be

450
00:18:15,769 --> 00:18:22,220
used to in soil remediation this

451
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:24,200
particular earthworm species and so I

452
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:26,299
leaned over to him and asked him if he

453
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:28,279
was a soil scientist and sure enough I

454
00:18:26,299 --> 00:18:31,519
got I got seated probably next to the

455
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:34,579
only soil scientist on the plane which

456
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:39,619
was which was wonderful so he's he was a

457
00:18:34,579 --> 00:18:43,519
German professor who looked at they were

458
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:45,709
measuring in a given amount of soil they

459
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:49,639
would find they may have 20 different

460
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:51,110
species of earthworms and a certain

461
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:53,180
amount you know a certain concentration

462
00:18:51,109 --> 00:18:56,659
of those earthworms and they were able

463
00:18:53,180 --> 00:19:00,380
to use that data for a given area to see

464
00:18:56,660 --> 00:19:03,640
as an early indicator of the quality of

465
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:07,940
that soil or so to be able to address

466
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:09,440
soil problems before they got too bad so

467
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:11,390
essentially using the earthworm as an

468
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,809
early indicator species which was I

469
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:18,680
thought really interesting and then he

470
00:19:14,809 --> 00:19:20,269
was taking that and he said that they

471
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:22,970
were that they found some farmers were

472
00:19:20,269 --> 00:19:25,180
taking earthworm castings or course or

473
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:27,200
that have actual you know viable

474
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:29,060
earthworm species in it and then

475
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,350
planting him into fields that were

476
00:19:29,059 --> 00:19:33,019
degraded that didn't have good

477
00:19:30,349 --> 00:19:36,349
biodiversity and these cores they were

478
00:19:33,019 --> 00:19:38,450
able to move I believe it was 3 meters

479
00:19:36,349 --> 00:19:41,569
per year and so you'd end up with this

480
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:43,250
like circular patch around that core and

481
00:19:41,569 --> 00:19:45,559
there's a company doing this now in

482
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:48,170
Germany and coring these fields and

483
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:51,319
you'd see much healthier plants

484
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:53,120
biodiversity all of these benefits from

485
00:19:51,319 --> 00:19:54,950
this application so that was just

486
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:58,489
something I wanted to share that

487
00:19:54,950 --> 00:20:01,700
happened happened to me this weekend but

488
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:03,349
then when I got to this conference it

489
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,670
was very different because

490
00:20:03,349 --> 00:20:05,899
one of the things I found with

491
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:08,090
university professors is they want

492
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:09,259
everything to be controlled you know if

493
00:20:08,089 --> 00:20:11,539
they want to run a study they want to

494
00:20:09,259 --> 00:20:13,579
control every variable and the challenge

495
00:20:11,539 --> 00:20:15,319
there is when you look at organics and

496
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:17,299
and what we've talked about with

497
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:21,799
biodiversity you really you really can't

498
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:25,460
so that a lot of the studies a lot of

499
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:28,339
the studies with organics may add too

500
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:30,559
much too much variability I don't know

501
00:20:28,339 --> 00:20:32,769
what your thoughts are are on that but

502
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:35,470
it seemed it was difficult to get the

503
00:20:32,769 --> 00:20:38,029
academic people there to talk about

504
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:40,759
organics sorted or to look at organics

505
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:43,579
just because of the complexity of the

506
00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:45,799
ecosystem yeah I mean I think that's

507
00:20:43,579 --> 00:20:47,329
that's one of like the hardest things of

508
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:48,859
working in ecology is you're you're

509
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:51,470
working with these living systems that

510
00:20:48,859 --> 00:20:53,209
have I mean ecology is like the it's the

511
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:55,069
inner linking of all of these these

512
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:58,519
different things and there's just

513
00:20:55,069 --> 00:21:01,279
effects from the the light the the air

514
00:20:58,519 --> 00:21:02,839
and the like all the different gases the

515
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:05,899
water is just all these different

516
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:07,970
effects and I think it's it's yeah it's

517
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:10,340
incredibly difficult to isolate you know

518
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:12,500
the variables of you know what what has

519
00:21:10,339 --> 00:21:14,359
actually happened in effect and I mean

520
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:17,269
it's funny because it's my PhD work I

521
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:19,339
had access to these incredible systems

522
00:21:17,269 --> 00:21:21,710
we called them eco tubes and it really

523
00:21:19,339 --> 00:21:23,569
looked like you did not look like a

524
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:26,360
natural system at all but it was the

525
00:21:23,569 --> 00:21:28,279
best shot we had at trying to figure out

526
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:30,789
the true effect of soil biodiversity and

527
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:34,009
so these eco tubes were designed by my

528
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:37,039
my in German it's called dr. father

529
00:21:34,009 --> 00:21:40,670
it's my PhD advisor Marcel Vanderheiden

530
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:43,549
and they are these systems that they're

531
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:45,500
these it's used kind of cylinders with

532
00:21:43,549 --> 00:21:47,950
these clear plexiglass

533
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:50,450
tops and all of the air in the water

534
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:53,390
going into the system was filtered and

535
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:55,549
so we would we would only add it was it

536
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:57,980
was of the entire soil medium only five

537
00:21:55,549 --> 00:22:00,440
percent was our treatment so most of the

538
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:03,019
soil is actually sterilized but we would

539
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:04,640
add in a five percent inoculant of the

540
00:22:03,019 --> 00:22:08,210
soil biodiversity that we were testing

541
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:12,140
and so with with all the air and the

542
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:14,930
water being filtered going in and trying

543
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:17,060
to be basically eliminated the outside

544
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:18,289
contamination of different microbes

545
00:22:17,059 --> 00:22:22,609
we're living in the greenhouse already

546
00:22:18,289 --> 00:22:24,109
we that was a I would say probably one

547
00:22:22,609 --> 00:22:26,089
of the best systems that I've seen for

548
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:27,649
for trying to isolate solo biodiversity

549
00:22:26,089 --> 00:22:29,929
and of course it's artificial and

550
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:31,940
there's you know some negatives from

551
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:34,880
from having such an artificial system

552
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:36,860
but yeah I think that kind of really

553
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,080
what you're saying is nails nails the

554
00:22:36,859 --> 00:22:41,569
difficulty of testing organic systems

555
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:43,220
because to have an are you know to

556
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:46,009
really test an organic system you have

557
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:48,769
to kind of make a a non natural system

558
00:22:46,009 --> 00:22:50,900
to do it so it's it's incredibly

559
00:22:48,769 --> 00:22:52,579
difficult to isolate the effects and and

560
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:54,920
seeing like what's really causing the

561
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:56,899
differences in your system is it you

562
00:22:54,920 --> 00:23:00,259
know it's yes it's incredibly

563
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:02,480
challenging yeah I would also say it it

564
00:23:00,259 --> 00:23:05,089
may limit the amount of academic

565
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:08,390
interest in studying some of these

566
00:23:05,089 --> 00:23:10,220
organic concepts to because it's so much

567
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:13,370
harder to draw any sort of trends or

568
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:16,279
conclusions from the research and it's

569
00:23:13,369 --> 00:23:19,669
so there's a lot more challenges like we

570
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:22,910
discussed so I I guess my big takeaway

571
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:24,769
was that it still felt like at this at

572
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:28,970
this conference that more and more

573
00:23:24,769 --> 00:23:32,740
people are pushing for more conventional

574
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:35,480
agricultural I guess processes or

575
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:37,460
applications but hopefully we can take

576
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:40,430
some of that data and then apply it back

577
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:42,140
into organics so so take some of the

578
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:45,440
things that we're learning regarding

579
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:48,980
lighting and nutrition and then find

580
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:51,710
organic ways to replicate or or use that

581
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:55,370
information that they're from that

582
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:58,819
they're doing so along that note you had

583
00:23:55,369 --> 00:24:00,049
sent me this recent article in Wired

584
00:23:58,819 --> 00:24:02,539
there's a lot of stuff that you're

585
00:24:00,049 --> 00:24:05,869
finding in the news this came out on

586
00:24:02,539 --> 00:24:09,470
October 2nd and I'll post these articles

587
00:24:05,869 --> 00:24:11,149
on the podcast page this particular one

588
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:14,029
is called farmers can now buy designer

589
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:15,980
microbes to replace fertilizer would you

590
00:24:14,029 --> 00:24:20,420
want to talk a little bit about what the

591
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:22,940
findings in that article were yeah so it

592
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:24,769
was this Berkeley biotech start-up and

593
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:29,870
it was called pivot they called pivot

594
00:24:24,769 --> 00:24:30,859
bio and they they launched the first and

595
00:24:29,869 --> 00:24:33,349
only nitrogen

596
00:24:30,859 --> 00:24:35,509
reducing microbial treatment for four US

597
00:24:33,349 --> 00:24:37,548
corn farmers so they're essentially

598
00:24:35,509 --> 00:24:40,039
trying to in the nitrogen fixing

599
00:24:37,548 --> 00:24:42,259
bacteria that you normally find in like

600
00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:44,720
legumes or the fungi and bacteria but

601
00:24:42,259 --> 00:24:46,839
pair up with legumes they're trying to

602
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:49,039
do it pair it up with corn which is this

603
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:50,659
it's unheard of I mean it's it's

604
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:51,950
incredible to think that we have the

605
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:53,679
science to be able to do this but they

606
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:58,370
use like a bunch of gene editing tools

607
00:24:53,679 --> 00:25:01,880
to rewire the gene expression of these

608
00:24:58,369 --> 00:25:05,418
bacteria that they found that they found

609
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:08,570
them in nature paired up to the roots of

610
00:25:05,419 --> 00:25:11,360
some some corn but normally what happens

611
00:25:08,569 --> 00:25:13,519
in these agricultural systems is when

612
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:16,699
you when you throw fertilizer onto the

613
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:19,910
system you basically shut off the

614
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:21,950
responses of these these nitrogen fixing

615
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:23,330
bacteria like they they basically get

616
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:25,880
this thing like the plant sends out the

617
00:25:23,329 --> 00:25:28,099
signal that it has enough nutrients

618
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:30,049
coming in and so the the bacteria

619
00:25:28,099 --> 00:25:32,329
doesn't get the signal to pair up with

620
00:25:30,048 --> 00:25:36,259
the root but they've kind of switched

621
00:25:32,329 --> 00:25:38,599
the genes to make these bacteria keep on

622
00:25:36,259 --> 00:25:40,400
pairing with with the plant even when

623
00:25:38,599 --> 00:25:43,069
there is fertilizer inputs and so the

624
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,870
kind of idea of is that the farmer can

625
00:25:43,069 --> 00:25:46,639
keep adding fertilizer but also have the

626
00:25:44,869 --> 00:25:48,739
benefits of the bacteria that are there

627
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:51,590
increasing the efficiency of the uptake

628
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:54,319
of of the nitrogen so it's yeah it's

629
00:25:51,589 --> 00:25:57,079
crazy to think that we use we're already

630
00:25:54,319 --> 00:26:00,918
at a point where this is being put onto

631
00:25:57,079 --> 00:26:04,220
the market pretty advanced yeah now

632
00:26:00,919 --> 00:26:05,780
knowing with your background I guess how

633
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:09,440
much concern do you think there is for

634
00:26:05,779 --> 00:26:12,558
the for the addition of you know

635
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:16,298
essentially these gene edited microbes

636
00:26:12,558 --> 00:26:18,470
or even non-native microbes to various

637
00:26:16,298 --> 00:26:21,379
soils in terms of their effect on

638
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:22,789
biodiversity it it appears from what I

639
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:25,940
see that you just don't see a lot of

640
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:27,798
microbial persistence which is why a lot

641
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:28,100
of these are being applied over and over

642
00:26:27,798 --> 00:26:29,929
again

643
00:26:28,099 --> 00:26:32,689
but what what sort of findings have you

644
00:26:29,929 --> 00:26:35,600
seen along that along those lines well I

645
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:37,880
think and nature is going to sort out

646
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:40,459
the populations itself you know if these

647
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:42,320
guys don't if they're not fitting into

648
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:43,940
the niche space of a particular

649
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:44,668
environment they're they're just not

650
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:47,308
going to be a little

651
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:51,059
there and other bacteria are going to be

652
00:26:47,308 --> 00:26:52,829
able to out-compete them but it yeah so

653
00:26:51,058 --> 00:26:54,298
it's it's I don't know like what kind of

654
00:26:52,829 --> 00:26:57,509
guarantee this company is going to give

655
00:26:54,298 --> 00:26:59,429
for the viability of this kind of

656
00:26:57,509 --> 00:27:01,470
application and if they if they're

657
00:26:59,429 --> 00:27:04,830
expecting people to probably have to

658
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:06,629
reapply every year I'm not sure but I

659
00:27:04,829 --> 00:27:08,009
think it's I don't think they can give

660
00:27:06,628 --> 00:27:09,858
any kind of guarantee of the

661
00:27:08,009 --> 00:27:12,269
effectiveness of this kind of product

662
00:27:09,858 --> 00:27:13,439
because everyone's system is different

663
00:27:12,269 --> 00:27:15,450
and they're going to have a completely

664
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:18,808
different soil microbial community

665
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:20,100
underground but is going they're good

666
00:27:18,808 --> 00:27:21,658
the species that are living they're

667
00:27:20,099 --> 00:27:24,569
going to determine you know whether or

668
00:27:21,659 --> 00:27:26,129
not this one survives so yeah it's it's

669
00:27:24,569 --> 00:27:29,308
gonna be really interesting to see like

670
00:27:26,128 --> 00:27:31,048
how how this all works out and and I

671
00:27:29,308 --> 00:27:33,749
mean it's terrible to think that you

672
00:27:31,048 --> 00:27:37,339
when you put these you know gene edited

673
00:27:33,749 --> 00:27:40,139
species into the ground you're kind of I

674
00:27:37,339 --> 00:27:42,658
don't know it's a little too hand like

675
00:27:40,138 --> 00:27:43,798
human hand heavy in in my opinion I

676
00:27:42,659 --> 00:27:47,759
think there's probably should be more

677
00:27:43,798 --> 00:27:49,288
tests done but yeah you you you think is

678
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:51,528
like the worst case if you're kind of

679
00:27:49,288 --> 00:27:54,839
growing a monster and if it somehow

680
00:27:51,528 --> 00:27:56,579
if this species really like takes off it

681
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:59,970
could take over and kill off native

682
00:27:56,579 --> 00:28:02,418
species and I think we just don't

683
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:08,269
understand soil biodiversity enough to

684
00:28:02,419 --> 00:28:10,919
really be messing with it so much but I

685
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:13,440
yeah we'll see where it goes I guess see

686
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:16,019
what happens so we may be playing God in

687
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:19,889
a sense and releasing essentially a lion

688
00:28:16,019 --> 00:28:21,269
in a petting zoo potentially I you know

689
00:28:19,888 --> 00:28:23,459
I had an interesting conversation with

690
00:28:21,269 --> 00:28:27,450
this German professor on the plane about

691
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:28,798
this and I was asking him about you know

692
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:31,950
essentially the exact same question I

693
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:33,028
asked you and he gave me a response and

694
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:34,830
I was like well you know you study

695
00:28:33,028 --> 00:28:37,648
earthworms earthworms are not native to

696
00:28:34,829 --> 00:28:39,388
North America but they have a ton of

697
00:28:37,648 --> 00:28:41,579
benefits and we're all glad they're here

698
00:28:39,388 --> 00:28:43,618
and he said well his colleagues in

699
00:28:41,579 --> 00:28:46,858
Canada actually there's certain species

700
00:28:43,618 --> 00:28:49,470
of plants that require a mulch a heavy

701
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:51,298
mulch layer and the earthworms are

702
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:53,909
breaking it down too quickly causing

703
00:28:51,298 --> 00:28:57,269
these particular plants to really suffer

704
00:28:53,909 --> 00:28:58,320
and potentially go extinct so Wow

705
00:28:57,269 --> 00:28:59,788
you know

706
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:02,038
something that I think I've always

707
00:28:59,788 --> 00:29:05,869
thought of as a positive addition to our

708
00:29:02,038 --> 00:29:08,460
soils when we talk about worms does have

709
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:11,879
non-target organism effects that may or

710
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:15,240
may not be beneficial so it's something

711
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:16,590
to think about yeah and actually some

712
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:20,519
some work of my colleagues in

713
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:23,398
Switzerland and they found that that

714
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:25,558
some of the the biggest differences in

715
00:29:23,398 --> 00:29:28,109
in the effects on the above-ground

716
00:29:25,558 --> 00:29:30,569
community of soil biodiversity when they

717
00:29:28,109 --> 00:29:32,758
looked at the the soil community they

718
00:29:30,569 --> 00:29:35,339
found that the those systems that did

719
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:39,000
the best actually had populations of

720
00:29:35,339 --> 00:29:41,788
more rare species in them so they're

721
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:44,220
thinking that may be the reason that

722
00:29:41,788 --> 00:29:47,398
they systems did better with the higher

723
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:49,829
biodiversity was actually more of an

724
00:29:47,398 --> 00:29:52,138
effect of the rare species in the system

725
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:53,730
so I think you know maybe these rare

726
00:29:52,138 --> 00:29:56,638
species is there's something that we

727
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:58,349
need to focus on preserving more rather

728
00:29:56,638 --> 00:30:00,240
than just finding one species that does

729
00:29:58,349 --> 00:30:03,509
X really well and so we had a bunch of

730
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:06,329
that it's like you need to kind of focus

731
00:30:03,509 --> 00:30:10,110
on the entire community and not not just

732
00:30:06,329 --> 00:30:11,970
individuals yes and one difference I do

733
00:30:10,109 --> 00:30:14,969
want to point out between you know your

734
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:17,629
product and you know this particular

735
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:20,190
study is that your product contains

736
00:30:17,628 --> 00:30:22,349
bacteria and fungi that are already

737
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:25,470
found essentially worldwide they're

738
00:30:22,349 --> 00:30:29,579
native to I think all soils as far as I

739
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:30,509
know yeah that's exactly okay I just

740
00:30:29,579 --> 00:30:32,668
wanted to point that out for people

741
00:30:30,509 --> 00:30:36,798
because I want to make sure that we're

742
00:30:32,669 --> 00:30:39,059
we're distinguishing the two yeah so

743
00:30:36,798 --> 00:30:40,378
what I wanted to move on to there was

744
00:30:39,058 --> 00:30:42,058
one other study I want to talk about

745
00:30:40,378 --> 00:30:43,408
with you that Stephanie actually sent

746
00:30:42,058 --> 00:30:46,470
over and this one I thought was really

747
00:30:43,409 --> 00:30:47,879
fascinating it came out on July 26 this

748
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:50,819
article out of the University of

749
00:30:47,878 --> 00:30:54,089
California Berkeley entitled fertilizer

750
00:30:50,819 --> 00:30:57,569
destroys plants micro biomes ability to

751
00:30:54,089 --> 00:30:58,980
protect against disease I know she sent

752
00:30:57,569 --> 00:31:01,319
it to you as well did did you want to

753
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:04,589
talk about that a little bit yeah this

754
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:07,528
is a really interesting study yeah they

755
00:31:04,589 --> 00:31:11,339
found that that when you when you add

756
00:31:07,528 --> 00:31:12,119
fertilizer to the system before before

757
00:31:11,339 --> 00:31:14,579
they they threw an

758
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:16,939
it was a Pseudomonas species that causes

759
00:31:14,579 --> 00:31:19,649
some kind of blight in the tomatoes

760
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:22,320
before applying that Pseudomonas they

761
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:24,950
they applied fertilizer and they found

762
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:28,829
that this application of fertilizer

763
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:31,289
negated the protection of that the mic

764
00:31:28,829 --> 00:31:33,990
that the biodiversity normally had for

765
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:38,039
protecting the plant against the disease

766
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:41,069
and so so when when when there was

767
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:43,589
fertilizer applied and they put the

768
00:31:41,069 --> 00:31:45,889
Pseudomonas on there it completely took

769
00:31:43,589 --> 00:31:48,569
out the the plant and if they had

770
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:49,680
biodiversity there then the plan was or

771
00:31:48,569 --> 00:31:51,990
they didn't have the fertilizer

772
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:53,789
application before send the microbiome

773
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:57,750
was it was able to protect the system

774
00:31:53,789 --> 00:31:59,789
from the incoming Pseudomonas so yeah it

775
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:01,339
was it was it's a really interesting

776
00:31:59,789 --> 00:32:05,670
finding

777
00:32:01,339 --> 00:32:07,259
so in yeah I think it's just the

778
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:09,090
changing of the nutrients when you when

779
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:10,769
you throw in as fertilizers into the

780
00:32:09,089 --> 00:32:15,209
system it really just throws off the

781
00:32:10,769 --> 00:32:17,460
balance of the microbiome and and then I

782
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:18,090
think also that when you throw on

783
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:20,970
fertilizer

784
00:32:18,089 --> 00:32:23,099
the plant if it gets the signal that it

785
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:26,460
has enough nutrients and so it doesn't

786
00:32:23,099 --> 00:32:28,409
send out the amino acids and signals to

787
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:32,819
pair up with with more of the species on

788
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:35,190
your ground and so then you're you don't

789
00:32:32,819 --> 00:32:36,990
get the symbiotic pairing with with the

790
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:39,269
good guys and so when the bad guys come

791
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:40,920
in the systems open and free and they're

792
00:32:39,269 --> 00:32:45,480
able to come in and just you know munch

793
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:48,269
at the at their will on the plant yeah

794
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:52,410
one other really interesting result from

795
00:32:48,269 --> 00:32:56,099
this study was they found the best the

796
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:59,009
most protective community of of microbes

797
00:32:56,099 --> 00:33:00,929
was the lowest application dose as well

798
00:32:59,009 --> 00:33:04,950
so the higher they applied the microbial

799
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:07,200
community the less plant resistance they

800
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:10,470
got to the diseases that they were they

801
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:12,059
were adding yeah and you initially look

802
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:15,120
at that and you're like cadets that's

803
00:33:12,059 --> 00:33:17,970
weird but and if you think about it

804
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:20,549
there they looked at the details of this

805
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:24,319
because that this just looks strange to

806
00:33:20,549 --> 00:33:25,980
me and and I found that they they only

807
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:29,490
applied

808
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:31,319
culturable species to the that's what

809
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:33,660
their microbiome was they're there

810
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:36,839
manipulated microbiome so it's only

811
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:38,940
twelve species but they only they did

812
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:43,980
the testing it was one week after the

813
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:45,990
application and so in my mind if you if

814
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:47,789
you have more species that you're

815
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:49,440
throwing in its gonna take a lot longer

816
00:33:47,789 --> 00:33:52,798
than a week for everyone to kind of get

817
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:55,470
situated and find their place so yeah I

818
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:56,700
think that you have species trying to

819
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:58,890
they're kind of all battling for

820
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:01,169
nutrients and getting settled in their

821
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:03,299
new space and so I don't know I would

822
00:34:01,169 --> 00:34:06,000
like to see how those results would

823
00:34:03,298 --> 00:34:08,280
change if they tested later than one

824
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,960
week after application but yeah I would

825
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:12,690
I don't know about the details of what

826
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:15,809
exact species they were and yeah I'd

827
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:17,909
have to have to read more on it so they

828
00:34:15,809 --> 00:34:20,940
yeah they took healthy tomatoes and then

829
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:23,820
cultured twelve bacterial species that

830
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:25,289
they found naturalized and and thriving

831
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:27,720
on these healthy tomatoes and then

832
00:34:25,289 --> 00:34:28,918
sprayed them on to new Tomatoes so just

833
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:31,019
to kind of explain that to people and

834
00:34:28,918 --> 00:34:32,849
all I'll post this article on the

835
00:34:31,019 --> 00:34:35,550
podcast page as well so people can read

836
00:34:32,849 --> 00:34:39,809
it did you notice if the twelve species

837
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:42,899
came from the same location I didn't I

838
00:34:39,809 --> 00:34:44,840
didn't see that in there I just saw that

839
00:34:42,898 --> 00:34:48,239
they took them from healthy Tomatoes

840
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:49,019
yeah and so I was wondering if maybe

841
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:52,229
they were coming from different

842
00:34:49,019 --> 00:34:54,358
locations which would then indicate they

843
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:57,030
would probably even be battling more for

844
00:34:54,358 --> 00:34:58,619
the new space and it would just be like

845
00:34:57,030 --> 00:35:01,350
a rougher transition for that first week

846
00:34:58,619 --> 00:35:03,869
of the species together but I don't yeah

847
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:05,339
it's just another thought yeah it's

848
00:35:03,869 --> 00:35:07,440
interesting because one of the claims

849
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:09,450
that you hear out of the compost tea

850
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,940
world which is something I want to talk

851
00:35:09,449 --> 00:35:14,460
to you about next year is that foliar

852
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:16,519
applications of compost tea provide

853
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:18,570
aerobic or beneficial microorganisms

854
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:20,670
directly on the leaf surface of the

855
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:24,000
plant that will out-compete pathogens

856
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:27,960
for that leaf space now whether or not

857
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:30,329
that is true it's hard to say I haven't

858
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:33,000
seen enough actual research on it and

859
00:35:30,329 --> 00:35:34,409
compost tea very so much that it'd be

860
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,579
really hard to draw any conclusions

861
00:35:34,409 --> 00:35:39,868
anyway but it sort of goes in well in

862
00:35:38,579 --> 00:35:42,420
some ways opposition to the

863
00:35:39,869 --> 00:35:44,910
but also in support of the idea of

864
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:47,730
having a healthy microbiome on your leaf

865
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:49,618
surface yeah I mean it's called like

866
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:52,498
pre-emptive colonization is like if the

867
00:35:49,619 --> 00:35:53,940
yeah it's just there's no space in the

868
00:35:52,498 --> 00:35:55,169
end you know if it's someone's living

869
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:56,789
there and they're eating up all the

870
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:58,829
resources there's just not going to be

871
00:35:56,789 --> 00:36:00,569
any available for the new guy coming in

872
00:35:58,829 --> 00:36:03,769
so it's just it's harder for them to

873
00:36:00,568 --> 00:36:08,278
colonize so I think it's it's definitely

874
00:36:03,768 --> 00:36:09,689
a valid valid argument and also I think

875
00:36:08,278 --> 00:36:11,489
we should be careful with foliar

876
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:15,720
applications knowing that we may be

877
00:36:11,489 --> 00:36:19,768
increasing the opportunity opportunistic

878
00:36:15,719 --> 00:36:22,919
bacteria for disease I guess on our on

879
00:36:19,768 --> 00:36:24,118
our Leafs themselves so that would be

880
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:26,849
the other conclusion I'd want to draw

881
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:30,660
from that but let's talk a little bit

882
00:36:26,849 --> 00:36:32,278
about you know plant probiotics versus

883
00:36:30,659 --> 00:36:34,588
compost tea and some of these other

884
00:36:32,278 --> 00:36:37,829
products on the market you know they are

885
00:36:34,588 --> 00:36:38,909
they are quite different can you can you

886
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:40,818
give a server an overview on your

887
00:36:38,909 --> 00:36:45,118
thoughts about about these differences

888
00:36:40,818 --> 00:36:47,639
yeah and I mean compost tea is great

889
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:49,769
like it's it's I think if you can

890
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:50,909
compost tea you should compost tea and

891
00:36:49,768 --> 00:36:53,219
I'm not we're not trying to replace

892
00:36:50,909 --> 00:36:56,219
compost tea but I just think that

893
00:36:53,219 --> 00:36:57,988
everyone not everyone has the time the

894
00:36:56,219 --> 00:37:01,199
resources and the knowledge to make a

895
00:36:57,989 --> 00:37:03,539
really good compost tea as you know it's

896
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:05,098
it takes a lot of trial and error to get

897
00:37:03,539 --> 00:37:07,528
like your compost heap

898
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:09,480
right and you have to have the right

899
00:37:07,528 --> 00:37:11,248
temperature the right nutrients with

900
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:14,068
feeder they have to figure out the right

901
00:37:11,248 --> 00:37:16,108
time for your environment it's always

902
00:37:14,068 --> 00:37:18,778
you know your stuff your starter species

903
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:21,119
is its dependent on what what you have

904
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:23,699
in there to start with so it's just a

905
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:25,470
lot of yeah it takes a lot of trial and

906
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:27,298
error to get it like a really good

907
00:37:25,469 --> 00:37:29,848
compost tea going so I made plant

908
00:37:27,298 --> 00:37:31,469
probiotics there's an easier way to get

909
00:37:29,849 --> 00:37:35,400
a lot of the benefits that you get with

910
00:37:31,469 --> 00:37:37,439
a compost tea without having to you know

911
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:40,548
have a have all that trial and error

912
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:42,869
time and and also without the mess so

913
00:37:40,548 --> 00:37:44,219
it's especially good I guess if you're

914
00:37:42,869 --> 00:37:46,048
you're in an apartment or something

915
00:37:44,219 --> 00:37:48,358
neither can't really do a compost tea

916
00:37:46,048 --> 00:37:51,059
you know in your kitchen and you could

917
00:37:48,358 --> 00:37:53,068
but yeah it's just not as convenient so

918
00:37:51,059 --> 00:37:53,760
plant probiotics is kind of a convenient

919
00:37:53,068 --> 00:37:55,800
way to

920
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:59,640
a lot of the species that you're trying

921
00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:01,710
to grow and a good compost tea but just

922
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:06,690
have it in a more guaranteed and

923
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:09,829
convenient form and so yeah I think that

924
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:12,599
if you can compost tea you should do it

925
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:16,259
but it's it's it is like the next best

926
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:17,639
thing is a plant probiotics or or of

927
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:20,820
course having your own compost would be

928
00:38:17,639 --> 00:38:22,019
even better yeah I think when we're

929
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:25,980
talking about this we really have to

930
00:38:22,019 --> 00:38:28,590
compare oh look at all the pros and cons

931
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:32,340
so with compost tea or aerated compost

932
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:34,230
tea just to be specific here if there's

933
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:35,820
there's a lot of there's a lot of cost

934
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:37,199
associated with with having a good

935
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:39,510
Brewer it's not as simple as just

936
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:41,669
throwing an aquarium pump in a bubbler

937
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:44,010
in a bucket and then throwing in some

938
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:46,470
compost and a food source there actually

939
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:50,130
is a fair bit of science that goes into

940
00:38:46,469 --> 00:38:52,529
designing and and using a good brewing

941
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:55,079
system and the other child's with

942
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:57,000
compost tea is is variability so we

943
00:38:55,079 --> 00:39:00,599
don't we are never going to get the

944
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:02,550
exact same brew even if you use the

945
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:05,819
exact same water source compost source

946
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:07,380
brewing time it's still gonna vary quite

947
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:09,690
a bit and that's one of the challenges

948
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:13,740
is that variability there's also the

949
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:15,780
risk of potentially having pathogens in

950
00:39:13,739 --> 00:39:18,779
the compost tea now I think that's a

951
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:21,750
fairly low risk due to if you're using

952
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:25,190
high quality compost there's going to be

953
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:28,260
a majority of beneficial microorganisms

954
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:30,480
and then the last thing along that lines

955
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:32,160
is one advantage of compost tea is that

956
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:34,349
we're getting functional nutrient

957
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:38,129
cycling which is something that you you

958
00:39:34,349 --> 00:39:41,059
don't necessarily get with these other

959
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:45,750
microbial based products that being said

960
00:39:41,059 --> 00:39:47,610
you know microbial based product like

961
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:51,090
like yours may help increase nutrient

962
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:52,559
cycling once in the soil so I know a lot

963
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:56,100
of people have moved away from compost

964
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:58,139
tea just because of that variability but

965
00:39:56,099 --> 00:40:01,440
at the same time there's so much that we

966
00:39:58,139 --> 00:40:03,750
just don't know about soil plant

967
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:06,240
interactions in the rhizosphere that

968
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:07,619
people are you know even when people

969
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:09,808
make a less than

970
00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:12,088
great compost either a lot of times

971
00:40:09,809 --> 00:40:14,130
they're still seeing benefit and you

972
00:40:12,088 --> 00:40:15,808
know you've you've shown me results with

973
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:18,719
your product where even if you have a

974
00:40:15,809 --> 00:40:20,789
pretty good soil by adding you know

975
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:23,699
plant probiotics you're still seeing an

976
00:40:20,789 --> 00:40:24,809
increase in overall plant health yeah

977
00:40:23,699 --> 00:40:27,119
exactly

978
00:40:24,809 --> 00:40:28,859
yeah I think it would but I think you're

979
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:31,559
the major point there is is we don't

980
00:40:28,858 --> 00:40:33,808
really understand what's going on and so

981
00:40:31,559 --> 00:40:37,798
it's yeah it's kind of better to give

982
00:40:33,809 --> 00:40:40,499
the system more options you know without

983
00:40:37,798 --> 00:40:42,329
doing too much obviously but but letting

984
00:40:40,498 --> 00:40:44,818
it kind of sort out what it needs and

985
00:40:42,329 --> 00:40:48,528
just giving it giving it a kind of a

986
00:40:44,818 --> 00:40:51,298
buffet option of you know what to eat

987
00:40:48,528 --> 00:40:53,429
yeah and while we've talked about how we

988
00:40:51,298 --> 00:40:56,159
can't really control for every variable

989
00:40:53,429 --> 00:40:57,929
with organics and with these trials what

990
00:40:56,159 --> 00:40:59,879
what you could do is you know take a

991
00:40:57,929 --> 00:41:01,528
product like yours and apply it to a few

992
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:04,400
of your plants in your garden and see

993
00:41:01,528 --> 00:41:06,478
how they respond versus the other plants

994
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,798
you know trying to eliminate as many

995
00:41:06,478 --> 00:41:09,568
variables as possible and that would

996
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:12,268
really be an easy way to determine a

997
00:41:09,568 --> 00:41:15,688
cost-benefit analysis of you know adding

998
00:41:12,268 --> 00:41:17,518
a microbial product like this totally

999
00:41:15,688 --> 00:41:21,268
yeah so you can't look at your garden

1000
00:41:17,518 --> 00:41:22,528
and say like oh I'm missing some Glomus

1001
00:41:21,268 --> 00:41:25,468
and you're a disease and they're you

1002
00:41:22,528 --> 00:41:28,018
really it's if you gotta just to guess

1003
00:41:25,469 --> 00:41:30,420
and check um and if you side by side pot

1004
00:41:28,018 --> 00:41:32,278
experiments that's definitely the best

1005
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:34,079
way to try and figure it out figure out

1006
00:41:32,278 --> 00:41:37,469
where you're missing your biodiversity

1007
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:40,019
where's your dad so what other things

1008
00:41:37,469 --> 00:41:43,829
are you seeing here as you've started

1009
00:41:40,018 --> 00:41:46,978
working with gardeners and growers that

1010
00:41:43,829 --> 00:41:49,798
are using you know your product or

1011
00:41:46,978 --> 00:41:54,478
microbes as as an additive into their

1012
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:56,489
gardens what am I saying yeah what kind

1013
00:41:54,478 --> 00:41:58,108
of what kind of results are you seeing

1014
00:41:56,489 --> 00:41:59,999
is there anything you've learned from

1015
00:41:58,108 --> 00:42:01,018
now that you've had this company for a

1016
00:41:59,998 --> 00:42:03,778
few years

1017
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:05,278
in terms of how what sort of like

1018
00:42:03,778 --> 00:42:07,228
responses people are getting do they

1019
00:42:05,278 --> 00:42:09,028
vary quite a bit

1020
00:42:07,228 --> 00:42:12,899
are you hearing back the same things

1021
00:42:09,028 --> 00:42:14,880
from from growers or gardeners I I've

1022
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:16,769
gotten a lot of reviews from people that

1023
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:19,528
were just like you saved a plant that

1024
00:42:16,768 --> 00:42:21,518
was just totally on his way out and

1025
00:42:19,528 --> 00:42:24,188
they'd be tried you

1026
00:42:21,518 --> 00:42:25,629
adding different fertilizers and they

1027
00:42:24,188 --> 00:42:27,668
thought they had certain pest problems

1028
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:29,499
and they found that just adding the

1029
00:42:27,668 --> 00:42:32,408
plant probiotics really just it just

1030
00:42:29,498 --> 00:42:34,328
made the plant stronger and people are

1031
00:42:32,409 --> 00:42:36,249
finding I mean I have a guy who sends me

1032
00:42:34,329 --> 00:42:37,419
pictures of his roses every year cause

1033
00:42:36,248 --> 00:42:39,188
he's just like these are the most

1034
00:42:37,418 --> 00:42:41,798
beautiful roses I've ever had and he's

1035
00:42:39,188 --> 00:42:44,348
he's like just the guy's really into his

1036
00:42:41,798 --> 00:42:46,838
roses and so it's cool I mean I didn't

1037
00:42:44,349 --> 00:42:49,568
design the product for making roses more

1038
00:42:46,838 --> 00:42:53,798
beautiful but it's it's a great

1039
00:42:49,568 --> 00:42:55,028
byproduct of plant probiotics so but

1040
00:42:53,798 --> 00:42:57,849
yeah people are finding they just have

1041
00:42:55,028 --> 00:42:59,829
more robust plant communities they're

1042
00:42:57,849 --> 00:43:02,409
able to resist disease better they

1043
00:42:59,829 --> 00:43:06,369
they're able to survive through our

1044
00:43:02,409 --> 00:43:08,108
crazy rowdy summers now better and

1045
00:43:06,369 --> 00:43:10,298
that's because you know when you have a

1046
00:43:08,108 --> 00:43:11,679
fungal community that pairs up with the

1047
00:43:10,298 --> 00:43:13,869
roots of the plants and it really is a

1048
00:43:11,679 --> 00:43:14,229
crece now and extending the root of the

1049
00:43:13,869 --> 00:43:15,909
plant

1050
00:43:14,228 --> 00:43:17,858
that plant is going to be able to get to

1051
00:43:15,909 --> 00:43:20,798
more of the water that is existing in

1052
00:43:17,858 --> 00:43:22,389
the soil so when you do water it's it's

1053
00:43:20,798 --> 00:43:24,248
going to be more effective and more

1054
00:43:22,389 --> 00:43:26,858
efficient and the plant is going to be

1055
00:43:24,248 --> 00:43:30,418
able to better survive that the you know

1056
00:43:26,858 --> 00:43:32,648
the hotter drier days but yeah people

1057
00:43:30,418 --> 00:43:34,658
people have done a lot of positive

1058
00:43:32,648 --> 00:43:36,429
reviews and some people have said you

1059
00:43:34,659 --> 00:43:38,829
know didn't really do anything from for

1060
00:43:36,429 --> 00:43:41,588
my plants and maybe that's because they

1061
00:43:38,829 --> 00:43:45,249
had a really great diversity in their

1062
00:43:41,588 --> 00:43:49,509
soil already or it think it's really

1063
00:43:45,248 --> 00:43:50,798
hard to say you know why why exactly it

1064
00:43:49,509 --> 00:43:52,239
you know it might not have shown

1065
00:43:50,798 --> 00:43:54,130
positive effects on someone's system

1066
00:43:52,239 --> 00:43:56,228
like maybe they I don't know maybe they

1067
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:58,929
they applied it in a wrong way or

1068
00:43:56,228 --> 00:44:01,478
something but yeah it's really hard to

1069
00:43:58,929 --> 00:44:03,699
say but it's a good first Abbot at

1070
00:44:01,478 --> 00:44:07,538
trying to restore your biodiversity in

1071
00:44:03,699 --> 00:44:10,509
your soil but I think we just started

1072
00:44:07,539 --> 00:44:13,028
making a new shaker jar this year and

1073
00:44:10,509 --> 00:44:15,458
that's seem to go over really well with

1074
00:44:13,028 --> 00:44:17,199
a lot of people because that's one thing

1075
00:44:15,458 --> 00:44:21,458
I found is that people really like

1076
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:22,989
convenience and the we have a shaker jar

1077
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:25,989
it it looks kind of like just a little

1078
00:44:22,989 --> 00:44:27,219
spice jar and so you can take it and use

1079
00:44:25,989 --> 00:44:29,199
it in house plants really easily and

1080
00:44:27,219 --> 00:44:30,278
keep it under the sink and pull it out

1081
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:32,499
whenever your plants looking a little

1082
00:44:30,278 --> 00:44:34,179
sad and and just sprinkle it on the soil

1083
00:44:32,498 --> 00:44:35,199
surface and water it in and bam you're

1084
00:44:34,179 --> 00:44:36,519
done and you

1085
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:39,460
have to go out to your shed and change

1086
00:44:36,519 --> 00:44:41,139
out your soil and it's just a really

1087
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:43,210
easy and convenient way to try and help

1088
00:44:41,139 --> 00:44:45,039
your plants kind of in a more natural

1089
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:48,010
way than a lot of other things that you

1090
00:44:45,039 --> 00:44:49,960
can do so it's I found people really

1091
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:52,150
like convenience and they seem to be

1092
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:54,699
pretty pretty happy with their results

1093
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:57,070
in general so that gets me thinking

1094
00:44:54,699 --> 00:44:58,989
based on this research that we've

1095
00:44:57,070 --> 00:45:02,250
already discussed what do you think of

1096
00:44:58,989 --> 00:45:05,259
for I guess best practice around

1097
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:08,309
applications of microbial based products

1098
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:11,710
whether it's compost tea or your product

1099
00:45:08,309 --> 00:45:15,730
in regards to fertilizer and other

1100
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:19,510
applications well I think if you can get

1101
00:45:15,730 --> 00:45:22,329
your soil community strong and robust

1102
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:25,630
and diverse you're not going to need to

1103
00:45:22,329 --> 00:45:27,760
add excess fertilizer I mean unless it's

1104
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:29,079
like a really closed system and you'll

1105
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,579
probably have to if you're not restoring

1106
00:45:29,079 --> 00:45:31,839
it if you're not restoring the nutrients

1107
00:45:30,579 --> 00:45:33,670
in your system in any way and you're

1108
00:45:31,838 --> 00:45:34,570
taking stuff out of it constantly you're

1109
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:37,358
probably gonna have to restore it

1110
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:39,369
somehow but in general if you have a

1111
00:45:37,358 --> 00:45:42,190
natural soil community that's strong and

1112
00:45:39,369 --> 00:45:45,130
robust the soil microbes are going to do

1113
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:47,800
the work for you and you don't have to

1114
00:45:45,130 --> 00:45:50,318
add all the synthetics and the terrible

1115
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:52,568
things that have become like the norm

1116
00:45:50,318 --> 00:45:54,670
and mainstream that we're all starting

1117
00:45:52,568 --> 00:45:56,710
to realize or just they're bad for the

1118
00:45:54,670 --> 00:45:58,000
environment they're bad for us for our

1119
00:45:56,710 --> 00:45:59,920
bodies they're bad for the planet

1120
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,769
essentially they're bad for the soil

1121
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:06,730
community so we can kind of steer clear

1122
00:46:02,769 --> 00:46:10,630
of those if we have our soil or soil

1123
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:13,170
diverse and strong and healthy but I

1124
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:15,910
think yeah just just try out different

1125
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:17,889
species on different mixes and see what

1126
00:46:15,909 --> 00:46:22,480
works in your system see what you're

1127
00:46:17,889 --> 00:46:24,909
missing so yeah it from that respect I

1128
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:26,920
would say yeah look for to look for like

1129
00:46:24,909 --> 00:46:29,170
a diverse species list you're trying

1130
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:32,170
something else and then just yeah see

1131
00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:35,769
how your system responds so what about

1132
00:46:32,170 --> 00:46:39,639
adding additional micro mycorrhizal

1133
00:46:35,769 --> 00:46:42,219
fungus at you know at say for example

1134
00:46:39,639 --> 00:46:44,769
taking your product and another micro

1135
00:46:42,219 --> 00:46:47,549
product and adding them in at you know

1136
00:46:44,769 --> 00:46:49,380
initial transplant for example or

1137
00:46:47,550 --> 00:46:53,730
when when cloning have you seen anyone

1138
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:55,950
doing anything like that yeah I think

1139
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:58,710
that's probably the most effective time

1140
00:46:55,949 --> 00:47:00,659
to add the product because you're really

1141
00:46:58,710 --> 00:47:02,269
like you're you're putting it in right

1142
00:47:00,659 --> 00:47:06,779
at the root zone when you're planting

1143
00:47:02,269 --> 00:47:09,449
and and it's more of like a yeah a basic

1144
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:11,720
system so the the fungi and that the

1145
00:47:09,449 --> 00:47:13,829
plant root are more likely to pair up

1146
00:47:11,719 --> 00:47:16,109
but you're asking like what's the

1147
00:47:13,829 --> 00:47:18,000
difference between like between two

1148
00:47:16,110 --> 00:47:20,519
differents two different products or

1149
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,730
what like are you saying well I know you

1150
00:47:20,519 --> 00:47:24,750
have some gloma species in your product

1151
00:47:22,730 --> 00:47:27,179
uh-huh and then there's other ones that

1152
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:28,530
are more to have higher spore counts

1153
00:47:27,179 --> 00:47:31,019
that but may not have that same

1154
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:33,930
diversity like for for example the ones

1155
00:47:31,019 --> 00:47:36,269
that we currently sell or specifically

1156
00:47:33,929 --> 00:47:40,369
rise of agus inter a disease or Columbus

1157
00:47:36,269 --> 00:47:44,579
inter a disease because that is the most

1158
00:47:40,369 --> 00:47:46,949
researched form of our species of micro

1159
00:47:44,579 --> 00:47:48,900
so in regards to most of the plants that

1160
00:47:46,949 --> 00:47:50,609
people are growing is I know you already

1161
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:52,710
know this so I'm just throwing it out

1162
00:47:50,610 --> 00:47:55,110
there for listeners so adding a higher

1163
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:57,869
spore count say of the of that

1164
00:47:55,110 --> 00:48:01,769
particular Glomus species at the time of

1165
00:47:57,869 --> 00:48:03,420
inoculation we could add in your product

1166
00:48:01,769 --> 00:48:05,639
at the same time I guess is what I'm

1167
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:07,200
getting at is a way of increasing the

1168
00:48:05,639 --> 00:48:10,019
overall microbial community or a

1169
00:48:07,199 --> 00:48:12,210
microbiome yeah totally and I think

1170
00:48:10,019 --> 00:48:14,369
again it's finding that yeah that

1171
00:48:12,210 --> 00:48:18,240
missing missing piece and your in your

1172
00:48:14,369 --> 00:48:19,589
garden puzzle and because the system is

1173
00:48:18,239 --> 00:48:21,329
going to self-regulate like if it

1174
00:48:19,590 --> 00:48:24,420
already has too much inter a disease it

1175
00:48:21,329 --> 00:48:26,549
can only support so many so it's going

1176
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:28,440
to balance it out and I think yeah you

1177
00:48:26,550 --> 00:48:30,360
can you can add a bunch of different

1178
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:33,539
stuff and I don't know if the spore

1179
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:35,640
counts it definitely matters up to a

1180
00:48:33,539 --> 00:48:38,190
certain point but after that I think

1181
00:48:35,639 --> 00:48:40,980
it's just kind of maybe overkill because

1182
00:48:38,190 --> 00:48:44,070
long as you can guarantee the successful

1183
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:46,860
growth of spores you know a certain base

1184
00:48:44,070 --> 00:48:48,620
base base line of spores they're going

1185
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:50,760
to propagate and so they're gonna

1186
00:48:48,619 --> 00:48:53,339
they're going to fill up fill up your

1187
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:54,720
community you know even if you start

1188
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:57,059
with a low number if they have the

1189
00:48:54,719 --> 00:48:58,969
resources there and the the environment

1190
00:48:57,059 --> 00:49:01,110
is right for them they're going to bloom

1191
00:48:58,969 --> 00:49:02,669
so you just need to have like a

1192
00:49:01,110 --> 00:49:05,670
I would say like a minimum there's like

1193
00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:08,250
a minimum viable number that you should

1194
00:49:05,670 --> 00:49:11,039
have but yeah I I don't think

1195
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:12,750
necessarily having a lot more is really

1196
00:49:11,039 --> 00:49:14,579
going to make a huge difference in your

1197
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:17,070
system because if they can't support

1198
00:49:14,579 --> 00:49:19,469
them they'll just die off yeah that's a

1199
00:49:17,070 --> 00:49:20,610
good point I mean ultimately all we

1200
00:49:19,469 --> 00:49:23,279
really care about is that we're getting

1201
00:49:20,610 --> 00:49:24,900
this micro Raizel infection as quickly

1202
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,040
as possible when transplanting because a

1203
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:27,570
lot of people you know we're talking

1204
00:49:26,039 --> 00:49:30,210
about a pretty high value crop here with

1205
00:49:27,570 --> 00:49:32,640
cannabis and a pretty short growth cycle

1206
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:34,949
so getting that done as quickly as

1207
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:37,679
possible but the research that we talked

1208
00:49:34,949 --> 00:49:39,149
about today is showing that maybe higher

1209
00:49:37,679 --> 00:49:42,960
amounts of microbes are not always

1210
00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:44,579
necessarily better so I think there's a

1211
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:47,730
lot more research to be done on this I

1212
00:49:44,579 --> 00:49:49,289
think that's really interesting so while

1213
00:49:47,730 --> 00:49:51,570
I have you on the phone is there

1214
00:49:49,289 --> 00:49:53,489
anything else that you'd like to share

1215
00:49:51,570 --> 00:49:57,840
in regards to the future of your company

1216
00:49:53,489 --> 00:49:59,909
or the future of sort of microbiology

1217
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:01,440
and you know agriculture and

1218
00:49:59,909 --> 00:50:05,519
horticulture in general that you're

1219
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:07,829
seeing well yeah I mean I think for

1220
00:50:05,519 --> 00:50:11,219
plant probiotics you gotta just keep an

1221
00:50:07,829 --> 00:50:13,289
eye on things cuz I I have some some

1222
00:50:11,219 --> 00:50:15,569
ideas in the works of you know expanding

1223
00:50:13,289 --> 00:50:17,579
and adding different products you know

1224
00:50:15,570 --> 00:50:19,080
targeting different plants specifically

1225
00:50:17,579 --> 00:50:21,299
because we know that there are there

1226
00:50:19,079 --> 00:50:25,259
specific species that pair up better

1227
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:28,200
with certain plants and and so yeah I'm

1228
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:30,510
trying to constantly evolve evolve the

1229
00:50:28,199 --> 00:50:32,669
product maybe just go for a different

1230
00:50:30,510 --> 00:50:34,770
you know having a line of products that

1231
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:37,050
that go for different different plants

1232
00:50:34,769 --> 00:50:41,670
and different targets so keep an eye on

1233
00:50:37,050 --> 00:50:43,980
that but yeah in terms of I think I

1234
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:45,599
think it was it Dave Montgomery talks

1235
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:48,990
about like the first agricultural

1236
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:50,940
revolution that we're in right now and I

1237
00:50:48,989 --> 00:50:53,909
think yes it's I think it's an exciting

1238
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:57,750
time like we we are learning how to kind

1239
00:50:53,909 --> 00:50:59,309
of give the power back to nature and in

1240
00:50:57,750 --> 00:51:01,619
our growing systems and we're realizing

1241
00:50:59,309 --> 00:51:03,690
that you know us interfering and adding

1242
00:51:01,619 --> 00:51:06,630
you know all these synthetic you know

1243
00:51:03,690 --> 00:51:10,170
fertilizers and pesticides is not really

1244
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:12,180
the way to go and so it's exciting to

1245
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:14,280
see like where we're going with this

1246
00:51:12,179 --> 00:51:15,059
kind of encouraging our soil

1247
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:18,510
biodiversity

1248
00:51:15,059 --> 00:51:21,860
and letting nature do what it does best

1249
00:51:18,510 --> 00:51:24,570
which is grow plants and you know it's

1250
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:26,970
yeah it's it's it's an exciting time so

1251
00:51:24,570 --> 00:51:29,550
um it's good we'll keep an eye out on

1252
00:51:26,969 --> 00:51:32,339
things and I'm really interested to see

1253
00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:35,160
like where these these new biotech

1254
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:38,539
companies go with trying to isolate

1255
00:51:35,159 --> 00:51:43,849
different genes and and put them into

1256
00:51:38,539 --> 00:51:46,469
the agricultural systems yeah I've been

1257
00:51:43,849 --> 00:51:50,690
seeing more and more stuff pop up on

1258
00:51:46,469 --> 00:51:52,829
endo Finnick fungi and bacteria so

1259
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:56,250
microorganisms that actually live within

1260
00:51:52,829 --> 00:51:59,279
the plant the plant itself or within in

1261
00:51:56,250 --> 00:52:01,889
within the seed and I think it's I think

1262
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:06,090
that might be the next big thing here in

1263
00:52:01,889 --> 00:52:09,929
terms of biologicals and plant growth

1264
00:52:06,090 --> 00:52:11,460
but I'm it's sort of really really new

1265
00:52:09,929 --> 00:52:12,839
at this point I don't know if you've

1266
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:14,280
seen much research on that but it's

1267
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:16,710
something that I'm I think is really

1268
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:19,620
interesting yeah I haven't read much on

1269
00:52:16,710 --> 00:52:23,190
that I'll send you an article and when

1270
00:52:19,619 --> 00:52:25,319
we get off the phone okay but yeah I

1271
00:52:23,190 --> 00:52:27,269
really appreciate you coming on today I

1272
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:30,330
I think that answers all my questions

1273
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:31,019
and I look forward to I guess catching

1274
00:52:30,329 --> 00:52:34,559
up with you

1275
00:52:31,019 --> 00:52:37,110
here in the near future yeah yeah thanks

1276
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:39,090
for giving the opportunity to be on yeah

1277
00:52:37,110 --> 00:52:41,910
no actually I think we have a delivery

1278
00:52:39,090 --> 00:52:45,780
coming here through shop today some

1279
00:52:41,909 --> 00:52:48,029
plant probiotics so that was Sarah Pell

1280
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:49,710
