indoors in greenhouses and in facilities

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,680
that would otherwise be impossible or

28
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,439
impractical to do so

29
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,080

30

variety of topics ranging from vpd to

31
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:20,400
plant transpiration to optimizing your

32
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:22,640
drying and curing environment now on to

33
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,080

39
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:35,679
with you and i wanted to start off just

40
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,200
chatting a little bit about what you've

41
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:41,280

really talked was the last conference

46

that i went to before the pandemic

47
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,200
started which was

48
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:58,000
uh the indoor agriculture

49
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,280

50
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,118

yeah uh you know we've been doing pretty

57
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:19,439
good uh even even with covid and the

58
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:22,080
pandemic since you and i saw each other

59
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:24,479
in san diego we've hired two more

60
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,280
engineers full-time engineers so we are

61
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:28,959
now a staff including myself of four

62
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,919
engineers

63
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:34,319
we also hired a marketing person

64
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:37,679
um and we have you know

65
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:40,079
our admin staff and we are seven strong

66
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,719
right now so we've been growing

67
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,280
over the last year year and a half

68
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:46,159
so that's been really exciting

69
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,000
we

70
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:50,400
are approaching

71
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,878
i think 150 projects

72
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,760
since i started dr greenhouse we are

73
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:57,518
actually celebrating our fifth year

74
00:02:55,759 --> 00:03:01,919
uh so we

75
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:02,879
officially january 1st of 2022 will be

76
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:05,679
five

77
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:08,079
years since starting dr greenhouse

78
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,840
versus a soul prop and then as a

79
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,120
corporation

80
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,598
so

81
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,080
it's it's amazing to think that you know

82
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:17,919
i started by myself five years ago and

83
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,319
now i have a staff of seven and we

84
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:22,399
continue to grow and

85
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:23,199
work on projects all over the country

86
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,439
and

87
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:27,919
spattering around the world you know

88
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:30,959
both in in cannabis as well as leafy

89
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:32,479
greens and berries and tomatoes and

90
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,920
all other sorts of plants you can think

91
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:35,919
of that people are trying to grow

92
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:36,878
indoors it's it's uh

93
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:40,238
it's been

94
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:42,158
a wild ride

95
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,799
i i attended you know my first

96
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:46,959
conference in a year and a half live i

97
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,799
was at the cannabis conference last

98
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,280
month and it was so great to

99
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,000
to see people and catch up with people

100
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,039
and

101
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,519
um

102
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:58,158
it was uh you know i like that event a

103
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:00,158
lot just because it's very educational

104
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:02,239
and content

105
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:04,399
a lot of great people

106
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,719
and we actually did a podcast

107
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,680
we posted just a couple weeks ago where

108
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:11,680
i talked to people on on the exhibit

109
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,438
floor and asked them a couple questions

110
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,680
about the state of the industry and and

111
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:17,680
what they learned at the conference and

112
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,959
and it's really fascinating because out

113
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,720
of i think what the seven or eight

114
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,759
people that we talked to everybody had a

115
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,320
different

116
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:27,360
a different uh response had different

117
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:30,000
thoughts um and and so i i just love

118
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,960
hearing all those different perspectives

119
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,360
um

120
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:35,680
so yeah that's that's what we've been up

121
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,800
to you know just busy

122
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,319
um

123
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,120
getting more and more projects a lot

124
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:42,800
more repeat clients which you know is

125
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,079
always a good sign it means we're doing

126
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,960
something right

127
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:45,839
um

128
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:48,000
and

129
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:50,478
uh just meeting a lot of great people

130
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,800
even though it's it's remote and uh but

131
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:56,959
it's kind of fun because i get to see

132
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,560
people's fur babies and real babies and

133
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,560
yeah it's nice

134
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,560
that that's so wonderful to hear you

135
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,000
know when i hear people talk about hvac

136
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,560
i hear your name

137
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,360
uh come up a lot even by other hvac hvac

138
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,879
experts so it's it's wonderful to have

139
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,560
you back on the podcast it's wonderful

140
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:14,000
to hear that people are finding out

141
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,240
about the services that you're offering

142
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,759
that you're expanding um

143
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,360
what you know and some of the things i

144
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,120
just want to touch on here and we'll

145
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,520
have in the podcast links is that you

146
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,360
are doing a podcast as well which is

147
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:27,038
wonderful uh you know people should

148
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,560
definitely check that out and i'll have

149
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:30,800
that on the podcast page and then you're

150
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,360
also doing these webinars that are uh

151
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,240
free for people to listen in and and

152
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,479
learn about a lot of these topics too so

153
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,840
i highly suggest people check that out

154
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:44,879
as a great resource and um

155
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:46,879
yeah so beyond that one of the things uh

156
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:50,079
you and i just talked about

157
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:51,759
prior to recording here was you know vpd

158
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:54,639
and how that's such a buzzword still and

159
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,479
i know we talked about last podcast but

160
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:59,199
you know i think reviewing it and kind

161
00:05:56,478 --> 00:06:02,240
of expanding on on it a little bit would

162
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:04,879
be a great place to start the podcast so

163
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,639
i'll kind of let you take it from here

164
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:08,079
yeah sure um

165
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:11,199
you know

166
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:12,959
a vapor pressure deficit is somewhat of

167
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,600
a um

168
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:18,560
i don't know a difficult parameter to

169
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:22,000
wrap wrap our brains around but it is so

170
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:24,160
important in terms of the the health

171
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,279
of our plants whether you're growing

172
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:31,199
outside or in a greenhouse or or inside

173
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:33,918
plant transpiration rates plant quality

174
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,639
their you know nutrient delivery is all

175
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:38,959
really dependent on

176
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:42,478
the vapor pressure deficit so in a

177
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:44,879
nutshell what what vpd is is it's the

178
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:48,478
difference between what the vapor

179
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:50,959
pressure is inside the air so so let's

180
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:53,038
say you're in an indoor grow room

181
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:56,239
and you have a specific temperature or

182
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:58,079
humidity um of that room

183
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,120
and um

184
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:01,758
the

185
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,840
at that temperature and humidity you

186
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,720
have a vapor pressure

187
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:07,598
and

188
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:10,160
the vapor pressure deficit is what is

189
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:13,598
the vapor pressure of the room compared

190
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,520
to the saturation vapor pressure

191
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:18,240
at that same

192
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:19,038
air temperature so

193
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,879
um

194
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:25,680
what we're really trying to figure out

195
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:27,439
is sort of how dry the air is and and

196
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:31,759
the best way to think about it is the

197
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:35,120
word is the key word which is pressure

198
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:38,000
the bigger the vapor pressure deficit is

199
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,038
the more pressure we're putting on a

200
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,399
plant

201
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:43,519
to evaporate water same with humans

202
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:45,519
right if

203
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:48,639
if we have a high vapor pressure deficit

204
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:51,439
if it's dry let's say we're in southern

205
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:53,759
california and we're in a pool

206
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:54,719
and we get out of the pool

207
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,120
and

208
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,280
um you know we feel cool immediately

209
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,399
because that water is evaporating from

210
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:02,159
our skin

211
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:04,719
that's because we have a pretty high

212
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:08,000
vapor pressure deficit it's it's dry

213
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:10,240
compared to what the temperature is

214
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,879
but if we were in say florida you know

215
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,680
you travel 000 miles due

216
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:18,000
east the humidity is so much higher that

217
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,038
the vapor pressure deficit is so much

218
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,839
smaller

219
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:24,318
that that water takes a lot longer to

220
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:26,318
evaporate well it's the same exact thing

221
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,759
with plants is that you know at the

222
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,400
stomata

223
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,800
is liquid water right it's pulled water

224
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:34,718
from from its roots and it's transported

225
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:36,958
it through its stem and it's up to the

226
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:39,760
leaf and into the stomata and it's

227
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:42,158
liquid water and it's saturated and

228
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:43,918
depending on the pressure that the air

229
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:47,519
is putting on it depending on how dry

230
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:50,799
that air is that's how quickly the plant

231
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,720
is going to then evaporate and transpire

232
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:55,359
that water

233
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:58,879
and and the reason vpd is so important

234
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:01,200
is this idea of transpiration right so

235
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:03,120
the bigger the vpd is the faster the

236
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,839
plant's going to transpire the lower the

237
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:09,759
vpd is the slower the plant is going to

238
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:13,120
transpire and transpiration

239
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:16,399
is so critical to the plant's health

240
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:19,120
transpiration um helps with of course

241
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:21,200
transporting water from the roots all

242
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,200
the way through the plant

243
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,879
within that water are the nutrients

244
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,278
coming from the soil or from the

245
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:29,919
substrate that you're growing in so that

246
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:32,080
water is carrying nutrients to all the

247
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:34,639
different plant parts if we didn't have

248
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,320
transpiration there'd be no way to get

249
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:38,720
you know all those nutrients coming from

250
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,360
these beautiful soils to to the other

251
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:44,480
plant parts it helps cool the plant

252
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,800
through that evaporative cooling process

253
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,480
and it also helps a little bit with with

254
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:50,559
photosynthesis

255
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,759
just because we need a little bit of

256
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:54,559
that you know

257
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:56,559
hydrogen molecule um to create those

258
00:09:54,559 --> 00:10:00,239
carbohydrates right um during

259
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:04,239
photosynthesis so uh transpiration and

260
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:08,399
vpd are so closely linked and you know

261
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:11,680
if you have a low rate of transpiration

262
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:14,078
then what you might see is that plants

263
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:16,559
could wilt you can see some nutrient

264
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:18,559
deficiencies photosynthesis

265
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:20,078
might be slower

266
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:21,838
um on the other hand if your

267
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:23,439
transpiration rate is too high if the

268
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,000
vpd is so

269
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,839
so high that you know the room or the

270
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,799
air is so dry

271
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:33,920
then transpiration could be so quick

272
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:35,519
um that if you don't have enough water

273
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:38,240
at the roots in the soil and the

274
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,679
substrate then your plant will dry out

275
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,360
and that's when you start to see your

276
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:43,919
plant will because there's not enough

277
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,639
water for the plant to pull up through

278
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:47,039
it

279
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:48,720
and then evaporate into the air the

280
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:51,439
other thing is that you can get nutrient

281
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:54,079
deficiencies if the plants if the plants

282
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,480
transpire too quickly including and the

283
00:10:54,078 --> 00:11:00,399
probably the biggest one is calcium

284
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:03,120
calcium is transported with water so if

285
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:06,720
the water literally is moving at a

286
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:09,200
velocity too quick to carry this large

287
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:12,800
calcium molecule with it then you'll see

288
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:15,278
calcium deficiencies and that is

289
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:18,240
usually seen by sort of like these brown

290
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:20,879
edges um along along the leaves

291
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,440
especially new leaves um they're the

292
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:24,159
most susceptible to that

293
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,200
so

294
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:28,639
um

295
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:31,040
yeah you know vpd and transpiration

296
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:32,240
plant health plant

297
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:33,838
growth

298
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,360
all super

299
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,480
intertwined

300
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,759
together

301
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,079
um and

302
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:42,078
and i love hearing you know i just

303
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:43,278
mentioned that i was at this conference

304
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:45,359
last month

305
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:48,799
and the number of people

306
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,079
that talked about vpd or that vpd was

307
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:53,120
just in

308
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:55,199
the conversation just in their you know

309
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,839
their their lingo

310
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,639
has increased so much since i started

311
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:03,360
sort of preaching about vpd a few years

312
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:06,240
ago and i'm just so i'm glad to hear

313
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:09,039
hvac manufacturers talking about vpd

314
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,600
growers talking about vpd

315
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:15,199
monitoring and controls companies

316
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:17,278
talking about using vpd as

317
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,920
a metric to

318
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:21,439
you know to monitor and manage the room

319
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:24,240
environment

320
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:27,360
it's definitely becoming part of our

321
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,720
everyday language which is

322
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,360
which is great it's going to be great

323
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,360
for everybody

324
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:35,039
wow so that made me think about a couple

325
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,839
different things here so when we talk

326
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:38,799
about

327
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,560
transpiration um

328
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:43,679
you want it to be

329
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:44,638
sufficient to where you're not causing

330
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:46,159
uh

331
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:49,278
the plant to work too hard which would

332
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:51,679
limit your plant growth but also

333
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:53,679
not too slow that you have

334
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:56,159
water or humidity in the air that could

335
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:57,359
potentially lead to pathogen

336
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:59,600
issues too

337
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,480
like mold and mildew

338
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,440
absolutely so you know

339
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,360
when

340
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,800
when the humidity is high

341
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,759
that means that the vapor pressure

342
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:12,639
deficit is low and we know that when the

343
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:14,879
humidity is high that you know mold

344
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:17,600
tends to grow right it

345
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:20,879
molds you know it has a high

346
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:23,040
water activity uh when when the humidity

347
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:26,240
is greater than 60

348
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:29,039
um when you have a stressed plant or you

349
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,799
have a drying plant i would say that a

350
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:32,480
plant that you've chopped and are now

351
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:34,559
putting in a dry room that that's a

352
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,639
pretty stressed situation for that

353
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:39,439
branch because it has

354
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:42,639
lost its you know it's it's um

355
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:46,000
i don't know it's it's major body part

356
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:49,440
moving water through it and so um as

357
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,679
it's it's desiccating as it's drying um

358
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,360
you know if we don't drop that humidity

359
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:55,599
pretty low and we don't drop the

360
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,560
moisture out of that plant fairly

361
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,639
quickly

362
00:13:56,559 --> 00:14:01,039
um then you know molds are going to be

363
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:04,000
like oh hey this is awesome i have like

364
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:06,719
this you know really stressed out

365
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,879
plant that you know still has parts of

366
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,800
it living as it's gasping for its last

367
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:12,799
breath i'm going to take advantage of it

368
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:14,958
and and grow there

369
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:17,439
for a living plant

370
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:19,278
if you know if the humidity is too high

371
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,160
and the vapor pressure deficit is too

372
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:21,759
low

373
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:24,240
um then

374
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:26,639
what what can actually happen because

375
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,560
there's not enough pressure to evaporate

376
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:31,278
the water from the stomata

377
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:33,359
is that that liquid water that the plant

378
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:36,639
has you know lifted

379
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,839
uh to to the leaf and to the stomatal

380
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,959
opening

381
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,600
can stay

382
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:45,278
can can just sit there and now you have

383
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:48,399
this exposed water um you know i mean

384
00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:50,879
it's it's it's not a droplet necessarily

385
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:53,440
but you have this mouth that's open

386
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:57,360
ready to breathe out and that can now

387
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,560
become a place where mold can can find

388
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,120
you know

389
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:04,799
a place to to grow

390
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:07,039
on the other hand if the vpd is so high

391
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:09,039
and the room is so dry

392
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:10,319
so you're afraid of molds growing right

393
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:11,838
you're afraid of having too much

394
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,120
moisture in the room you're afraid of

395
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:16,160
condensation right and and mold growth

396
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,799
and so you're like okay i'm going to

397
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:21,198
pull as much moisture out of the air

398
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:22,958
as quickly as possible and i'm going to

399
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:25,439
create a really dry environment so that

400
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:27,679
those molds can't grow well what ends up

401
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,959
happening is that the plant gets really

402
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:30,399
stressed out

403
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:32,239
and so now you have a stressed out plant

404
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,000
and this is you know and i think growers

405
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:37,120
cannabis growers inherently know this

406
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,720
right because a lot of them will try to

407
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,039
drop the temperature

408
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,879
try to drop the humidity in the last

409
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:45,039
week or two of

410
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:46,639
the flowering plants life and what

411
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:48,958
they're doing whether they realize it or

412
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,720
not is stressing the plant so it thinks

413
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:52,879
it's going to die

414
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,680
because it is about to die

415
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:57,759
and um and that causes it right to

416
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:59,758
create more trichomes and terpenes and

417
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:02,000
colors and all those you know beautiful

418
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,199
aesthetic things that we're trying to

419
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,759
um

420
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:08,719
to get out of the plant um

421
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:12,000
but if we do that too soon then the

422
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:14,560
plant is stressed and now these mold

423
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,039
spores are like hey

424
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:20,559
i can take advantage of you your immune

425
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:22,559
system is compromised and

426
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:25,359
yeah you know like there's not as many

427
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:29,599
places for me to land but when i do land

428
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:32,879
and i do find um you know a nice spot uh

429
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:35,680
i'm gonna take you over uh and so

430
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:36,958
growers don't necessarily realize that

431
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:40,000
it's not just

432
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:42,719
high humidity that can be detrimental to

433
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,720
their plants and cause mold growth and

434
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,360
disease but it's also

435
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:49,278
low humidity that can do the same

436
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,240
powdery mildew is actually really

437
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:54,399
interesting uh in that it actually

438
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,839
propagates in

439
00:16:54,399 --> 00:17:00,320
or it actually

440
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:03,360
transports its spores through dry air

441
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:05,600
it the spores do need like a moist

442
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,480
surface in order to grow

443
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:10,000
but

444
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:12,318
they need it to be dry in order to move

445
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,599
from one location to the other location

446
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:16,720
so you mana you know i i just imagined

447
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:19,279
imagine

448
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,919
a cannabis you know

449
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:24,318
grow room and it's really dry and you

450
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,400
have all these circulation fans that are

451
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:28,639
blowing air around and creating air

452
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,480
movement helping with transpiration and

453
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,600
help break up the boundary layer across

454
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,798
the leaf

455
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:36,000
and

456
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:38,400
well you just moved you know mold spores

457
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,839
powdery mildew mold spores from one

458
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:44,080
place to the rest of your room

459
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:46,639
and then let's just say you don't have

460
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:48,798
the best control as you switch from

461
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,480
lights on to lights off and you get a

462
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:52,720
humidity spike

463
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:55,759
you just blew all those spores

464
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:58,160
everywhere and now you created you know

465
00:17:55,759 --> 00:18:00,480
inadvertently an environment where those

466
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:03,200
mold spores are going to be super happy

467
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,558
to propagate and now you don't just have

468
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,679
a problem in one place you have a

469
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:07,119
problem

470
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:10,400
everywhere

471
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:13,199
so i just i want i want growers to know

472
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,919
that you know too dry

473
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,279
can be just as detrimental to the

474
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,360
quality

475
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:24,480
of your of your plant and disease

476
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:24,479
control as is too high of a humidity

477
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,480
yeah one thing you touched on there from

478
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,039
a transpiration perspective

479
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,679
was this idea of

480
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:36,000
deficiencies showing in the plant due to

481
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,360
its ability to transpire either too high

482
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,519
or too low

483
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:41,519
one thing that i've talked about

484
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:43,440
in previous podcasts like one the one

485
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:45,440
with doc with uh don marshall that i

486
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,440
thought was interesting is the idea of

487
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,120
root hair death so both

488
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,960
too much water in the soil and too

489
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:52,639
little in the water soil causes root

490
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,798
hair death which creates the same

491
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,679
symptoms in the fact that the plant can

492
00:18:54,798 --> 00:19:00,960
no longer effectively take up water so

493
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:02,880
they're going to present fairly similar

494
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,319
even though the causes are

495
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,160
uh you know

496
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:08,159
both water related but on on two

497
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,279
extremes and so i just wanted to remind

498
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,840
folks of that because i think that's

499
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:14,879
fascinating

500
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:17,678
yeah i mean that is a very good point um

501
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,679
you know having soil

502
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:22,640
having a substrate that's that's over

503
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:25,038
watered right that that's too wet

504
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,120
you prevent oxygenation right and the

505
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:28,640
roots need oxygen yeah your plant is

506
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:32,000
using co2

507
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:34,000
um but your your roots are you know are

508
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,359
using oxygen and if you don't have air

509
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,359
gaps then

510
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:40,159
your roots are going to die on the other

511
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:42,479
hand if there's no water right and and

512
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,360
now you have this high vpd you have this

513
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,440
dry

514
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:47,519
room that you're trying to grow in your

515
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,480
plants are just going to wilt and fall

516
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:53,440
over because there's no water um to

517
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:55,200
transpire and lift them up um you know

518
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,200
that that is one of the other reasons

519
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,000
why transpiration is so important for

520
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,279
for

521
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,119
non-non-woody plants is that they

522
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:04,720
actually hold the plant up right like

523
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:06,399
that's what we're seeing when when

524
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,720
leaves wilt is that there's no

525
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:11,038
is that we're losing water in the plant

526
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,720
well the trunk of that plant

527
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:13,679
is being held up

528
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,798
through

529
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:20,000
the hydrogen bonds of the water moving

530
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:22,240
through that plant through transpiration

531
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,359
there there's no bark right there's no

532
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:28,240
wood that's holding that plant up it is

533
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:31,199
water that's holding that plant up um

534
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:33,279
and so the first signs of of not having

535
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,480
water is first you know the the leaves

536
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:38,720
dry out but if your plant starts to fall

537
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,640
over you're in trouble like you you've

538
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:44,079
probably passed the wilting point and

539
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,080
you're not going to recover that plant

540
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,759
yeah so what you know

541
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,280
one question i had is when you're

542
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:51,759
thinking about vpd there's a lot of

543
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:53,519
variables that create

544
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:55,759
the temperature and humidity in a room

545
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:57,519
which all relate to this ratio

546
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:59,919
what are your main variables that you're

547
00:20:57,519 --> 00:21:01,839
looking at when we talk about

548
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:04,720
controlled environment agriculture you

549
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:05,918
know really anything from say biomass to

550
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,360
media

551
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:11,120
um you know bringing in air and you know

552
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:13,439
exiting air

553
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:15,279
what what how do all those relationships

554
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:19,200
work together and how do you approach

555
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:21,359
that uh you know as an engineer

556
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:24,400
yeah i mean

557
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:27,119
every variable when growing a plant

558
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:29,200
is interconnected with another

559
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:32,239
variable or multiple

560
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,640
variables you know as as an hvac

561
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:37,279
mechanical engineer

562
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:39,200
we are pretty focused on you know the

563
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:41,839
aerial environment the environment of

564
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,279
the air around the plant right we're

565
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:45,599
trying to control

566
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:47,678
temperature and humidity and vapor

567
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:49,359
pressure deficit

568
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,919
so that we can control

569
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:54,639
uh you know transpiration but also

570
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:57,200
temperature of the air affects the leaf

571
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,280
temperature which affects the rate of

572
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,319
photosynthesis

573
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:01,678
and so

574
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:04,319
you know we

575
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:06,400
vpd is is not

576
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:08,399
mutually exclusive from temperature and

577
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:11,360
humidity and they're not necessarily

578
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:13,519
exclusive from themselves either

579
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:16,319
they're you know they all sort of work

580
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:19,038
together um and and

581
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:21,359
beyond that the other parameters that

582
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:22,240
we're interested in to control plant

583
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:24,558
growth

584
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,720
around the air is is carbon dioxide

585
00:22:24,558 --> 00:22:29,759
because plants can't photosynthesize

586
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:32,558
without without co2

587
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:35,839
as well as as the light environment and

588
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:37,759
the quality of of the air

589
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:40,399
and the quality of the air includes you

590
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:43,279
know does it have pests and pathogens in

591
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,480
it we hope not are there you know dust

592
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:45,839
particles

593
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,400
odor

594
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:51,199
is another air quality measure that we

595
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:53,759
help growers control and mitigate

596
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:57,679
through our designs

597
00:22:53,759 --> 00:23:00,400
and although we don't design lights

598
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:02,480
our hvac designs are

599
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:06,240
incredibly

600
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:09,440
dependent on the type and quantity

601
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,720
and intensity of the lights that growers

602
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,558
are using

603
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,640
to cultivate their plants i mean it is

604
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:17,678
the number one load assuming that you're

605
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:20,320
in a building that is well insulated if

606
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:23,038
you're in an indoor facility then the

607
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:24,960
primary load is going to be the primary

608
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:27,839
load by load i mean heat gain to the

609
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:30,200
room is going to be from the lights um

610
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:33,038
and then your primary you know

611
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:35,200
dehumidification load is coming from the

612
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:37,440
plants transpiring

613
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,279
if you're in a greenhouse it's actually

614
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,840
kind of the same it's not the lights

615
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:43,200
it's sunlight uh you know solar

616
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:46,639
radiation

617
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:48,480
accounts for 65 to 70 percent of the

618
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,880
total heat gain

619
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,798
into a greenhouse and then again you

620
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,679
still have plants transpiring and maybe

621
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:59,359
you have water evaporating from from the

622
00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:00,880
soil from the media uh to account for um

623
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:03,599
but you know if

624
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:06,320
we can get pretty much 90

625
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:08,240
85 to 90 percent of the way there with

626
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:10,480
our hvac designs and equipment

627
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:13,278
selections if we know what the lights

628
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,960
are and if we know what what plants are

629
00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:16,480
growing and how much you're going to

630
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,880
water them and how frequently you're

631
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,480
going to water them

632
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,919
and

633
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,038
you know

634
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,038
light

635
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:27,119
carbon dioxide

636
00:24:25,038 --> 00:24:30,000
and temperature

637
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:32,798
are three variables that are so

638
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,119
essential to plant

639
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:37,119
growth and photosynthesis

640
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:38,639
there is actually a lot of research

641
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:42,319
going on

642
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:44,480
academic research specifically around

643
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:46,319
lettuce plants and tomato plants and all

644
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:49,200
these other horticultural crops that we

645
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:51,278
can study at the university level that's

646
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,720
getting federal funding

647
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:56,000
to figure out

648
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:58,000
how to co-optimize these three

649
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,599
variables um

650
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,880
you know it

651
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:04,240
because every plant has an optimum it

652
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,360
has a curve

653
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:10,079
um where as you increase the temperature

654
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:11,759
photosynthesis increases and then it

655
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:14,480
hits some peak and then it starts to

656
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:16,798
drop off will you see a similar curve

657
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,960
when it comes to carbon dioxide when it

658
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:21,119
comes to light

659
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:24,079
but the point at which all three of

660
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:26,158
those peaks intersect together

661
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:28,960
that is the optimal

662
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:31,520
point at which we want to grow our plant

663
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,600
and every plant has a different peak for

664
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:34,960
each of those three variables i'm not

665
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:37,038
kidding what what you would see for

666
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,360
lettuce would look different than what

667
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:41,440
you would see for basil than what you

668
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:43,678
would see for cucumber than what you

669
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:46,320
would see for probably

670
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:48,400
cannabis sativa versus cannabis indica

671
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:50,960
versus you know

672
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:53,679
the thousands of strains and and

673
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,519
genetics uh genetic crossbreeds that

674
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:57,360
there are out there

675
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:59,278
and and that's one of the reasons why

676
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:02,079
cannabis is so challenging is because

677
00:25:59,278 --> 00:26:05,440
there are so many strains and cultivars

678
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:08,240
out there that it's hard to

679
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,960
figure out what the optimal point is for

680
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:13,120
those three specific variables for every

681
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,400
single one of those strains i mean i

682
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:16,319
think something that would help this

683
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,960
industry a lot would be to just find

684
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:21,918
like five or ten strains that everybody

685
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:24,640
loves everybody agrees on is available

686
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:27,200
to everyone and we could just optimize

687
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:29,840
the control variables for those and then

688
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:32,240
start playing with all the others

689
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:34,480
but you know aside from that

690
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:37,278
what kind of drives me crazy sometimes

691
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:40,240
when i talk to certain cannabis growers

692
00:26:37,278 --> 00:26:41,679
is this lack of understanding of of the

693
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,400
interactions between these three

694
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:46,798
variables so so i'll walk into a room

695
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,880
and you know they'll have

696
00:26:46,798 --> 00:26:50,400
you know 1000 watt high pressure sodium

697
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,200
lamps

698
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,679
and

699
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,120
they'll be running their co2 at 1500

700
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,278
parts per million

701
00:26:55,119 --> 00:27:00,558
but then they're trying to control to a

702
00:26:57,278 --> 00:27:02,400
temperature of 75 degrees

703
00:27:00,558 --> 00:27:04,319
and essentially what they're doing is

704
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:07,840
that they're hitting the accelerator and

705
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:07,839
the brake at the same time

706
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,599
you know

707
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:14,158
say what you want to say about the

708
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:16,719
research coming out of mississippi right

709
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:18,880
we know it's a crappy strain we know

710
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:21,839
that it's super old

711
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:24,080
and nobody grows this this uh this type

712
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:26,000
of cannabis anymore

713
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:27,359
but you know there is a study that came

714
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,200
out that said you know really the

715
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:31,918
optimal temperature for cannabis is

716
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:34,558
around 80 or 82 degrees

717
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:36,320
but i rarely see growers

718
00:27:34,558 --> 00:27:38,158
operating at that temperature and i get

719
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:40,158
it i know why they're doing it because

720
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:42,559
if the ac system

721
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:45,679
went down right if you're operating at

722
00:27:42,558 --> 00:27:49,839
80 or 82 degrees you only have a few

723
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:53,360
degrees of movement really at 85 degrees

724
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:56,720
you know the the plant just shuts down

725
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:58,158
so it's better right like if you are

726
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,440
uncertain

727
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:02,960
about

728
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:05,200
your ac equipment operating

729
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:08,159
when you're running high pressure sodium

730
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,679
lamps and at 82 degrees and you're you

731
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:12,960
think that your ac system could break

732
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:15,120
down then yeah running your room at 75

733
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,399
degrees so that you have sort of this 10

734
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:17,199
degree window

735
00:28:16,398 --> 00:28:18,639
to

736
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,640
to make a fix

737
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,720
right to get a temporary solution in

738
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:25,278
there until you can get a compressor

739
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:29,360
replaced or do whatever

740
00:28:25,278 --> 00:28:32,000
i i get that that risk assessment but

741
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:36,639
with the technology that we now have

742
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:38,798
today you know versus 10 or 15 years ago

743
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:41,679
we should have a lot more confidence in

744
00:28:38,798 --> 00:28:44,480
our hvac equipment to

745
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:47,278
keep operating even if our temperature

746
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:50,159
is at 80 or 82 degrees

747
00:28:47,278 --> 00:28:52,240
you know if if every room

748
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:53,760
if these cannabis facilities were using

749
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,679
thousand watts

750
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:56,879
80 degree

751
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:59,519
temperature

752
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:02,320
and 1500 parts per million

753
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:04,000
i mean i think the yields would would

754
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:05,918
sky rocket i mean they would be so much

755
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,038
higher and and growers who i've talked

756
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:09,278
to that

757
00:29:07,038 --> 00:29:11,440
are towing that line that are trying to

758
00:29:09,278 --> 00:29:13,599
optimize those three variables together

759
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:16,240
are having really successful

760
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:17,839
results now what i want to say about

761
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,599
raising that temperature if there's a

762
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:21,278
grower out there that's like okay you

763
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:23,599
know i'm going to play with raising the

764
00:29:21,278 --> 00:29:26,720
temperature i'm growing at 75 degrees

765
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:29,278
and 50 relative humidity right now so

766
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:31,200
i'm going to adjust to 77 degrees right

767
00:29:29,278 --> 00:29:33,440
i feel comfortable at 2 degrees my ac

768
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,278
unit hasn't failed on me yet and they

769
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:38,640
raise the temperature

770
00:29:35,278 --> 00:29:42,079
you should also be raising the relative

771
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:43,278
humidity so for every degree increase in

772
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:46,558
temperature

773
00:29:43,278 --> 00:29:48,880
that that you add to your target room

774
00:29:46,558 --> 00:29:50,879
set point you should increase the

775
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,840
relative humidity by three to five

776
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,399
percent

777
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:56,959
so if you were growing at 75 degrees and

778
00:29:54,398 --> 00:29:58,798
50 relative humidity and now you want to

779
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:01,120
go up to 77

780
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:05,599
you should probably be closer to

781
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:09,119
you know 60 percent relative humidity 68

782
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:11,678
70 relative humidity if you're gonna hit

783
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:13,759
80 degrees this is a scary number for

784
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:15,840
growers i know but if you're at 80

785
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:18,879
degrees you should probably be closer to

786
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:22,000
65 or 70 percent relative humidity i

787
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:24,480
know that's scary but that's a vpd of 1

788
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,278
to 1.2 kilopascals

789
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,120
which

790
00:30:25,278 --> 00:30:28,079
is the sweet spot

791
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:29,199
for

792
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:31,839
healthy

793
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:34,000
productive plants

794
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:36,398
again if you want to stress your plant

795
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,558
and chill it at the end and you know

796
00:30:36,398 --> 00:30:39,839
depleted of water and nitrogen and all

797
00:30:38,558 --> 00:30:41,519
these things that you do to stress the

798
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:42,558
plant at the end of the light at the end

799
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:45,278
of life

800
00:30:42,558 --> 00:30:47,278
yes i i get you know lower the lower the

801
00:30:45,278 --> 00:30:49,038
temperature lower the humidity make it

802
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:51,278
feel like it's you know late fall and

803
00:30:49,038 --> 00:30:52,398
humble right and that plant is going to

804
00:30:51,278 --> 00:30:55,119
die

805
00:30:52,398 --> 00:30:57,038
but during your normal production

806
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:58,639
target a higher temperature target a

807
00:30:57,038 --> 00:31:01,839
higher humidity your plant is going to

808
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:03,440
be so healthy that those molds that

809
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:05,678
you're concerned about

810
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,679
are not going to have

811
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:08,720
you know a place

812
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:10,880
to

813
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,720
to to grow because the plant is going to

814
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:16,480
be healthy and it's going to be able to

815
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,480
fight those those diseases off

816
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:21,119
that's that's so interesting that was

817
00:31:18,798 --> 00:31:24,079
great information um

818
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:26,719
anecdotally uh a good friend of mine uh

819
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:28,319
justin mcgill he had an employee who

820
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,200
accidentally

821
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:30,960
uh

822
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,120
i don't remember exactly how it happened

823
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:35,360
but essentially had a huge humidity

824
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:37,839
spike in his room uh for a period of

825
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:41,759
time before he caught it and

826
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:44,720
his his employee but his name was buster

827
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:47,759
did this accidentally in in this medical

828
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:49,839
room and the plants just took off

829
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:51,679
and so they he started calling it swamp

830
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:54,720
mode because essentially that higher

831
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:56,720
humidity higher temperature uh in veg

832
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,640
really led to like you said much

833
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,038
healthier plants and they weren't seeing

834
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,640
powdery mildew take over just i think

835
00:32:01,038 --> 00:32:04,000
relation to what you're what you're

836
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,399
alluding to and this idea that the

837
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,919
plants are healthier too so

838
00:32:06,398 --> 00:32:09,759
you know i don't think humidity is

839
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:12,880
something we necessarily have to be

840
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:15,119
afraid of as much as we have been

841
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,640
you know 15 20 years ago when people

842
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:18,319
were growing in in their basements and

843
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,919
closets

844
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:20,960
i think we have a better understanding

845
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:22,080
of it but

846
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,319
but one of the things that you talked

847
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:26,480
about that i think i just want to

848
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:28,558
reiterate is this idea of the the

849
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,519
massive genetic diversity that we're

850
00:32:28,558 --> 00:32:32,079
seeing

851
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:33,440
in cannabis production so when we talk

852
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:36,398
about a commercial facility you know

853
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:38,960
they may have upwards 15 20

854
00:32:36,398 --> 00:32:42,079
or more different cultivars in a given

855
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:43,519
room and so trying to optimize that room

856
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:46,158
for all the cultivars is really

857
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:47,839
impossible because of that diversity and

858
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:49,600
each one liking slightly different

859
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:52,639
optimal points so

860
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:55,599
trying to hit a target that works for

861
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:58,159
you know as many plants as possible

862
00:32:55,599 --> 00:33:00,480
in that room and i realize that could be

863
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:02,720
specific to each facility but i think

864
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:04,240
having that range is is really really

865
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,640
important

866
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,640
i mean

867
00:33:06,798 --> 00:33:10,000
you know

868
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:12,080
like being a politician if you're trying

869
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,278
to make everyone happy you're making no

870
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:15,119
one happy

871
00:33:13,278 --> 00:33:16,398
um and

872
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:17,839
you know that's basically what we're

873
00:33:16,398 --> 00:33:21,599
doing with these strains and cultivars

874
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:24,158
if you have half a doubt half a dozen

875
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:27,199
different strains in the same room you

876
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:28,480
know a growers is probably trying to

877
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,360
find

878
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:35,200
a temperature and humidity range

879
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:37,678
that all of those strains can grow under

880
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:41,759
but none of them are going to be

881
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:43,440
optimized for any of those strains right

882
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:45,519
and

883
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,038
and and that is a problem you know there

884
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:50,720
have been a few growers that we've

885
00:33:47,038 --> 00:33:53,200
worked with that are strain specific

886
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:56,960
to their grow room or they have two

887
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:59,600
strains that have similar physiologies

888
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:01,278
and environmental responses and and

889
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:03,199
they've learned that and so they grow

890
00:34:01,278 --> 00:34:04,880
those together

891
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,480
you know

892
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:10,639
because there is so much genetic

893
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:13,440
diversity it is so hard to figure out

894
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:14,639
what what the ideal conditions are for

895
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,679
any of those strains because there's

896
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:17,440
just not

897
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:19,358
there even growers who are doing their

898
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:22,159
own internal r d

899
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:24,078
i don't know of any and maybe you do and

900
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:26,480
i'm sure there are some out there who

901
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:29,200
are looking strained specifically you

902
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:31,440
know at light levels hopefully they're

903
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:33,918
looking at temperature and humidity

904
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:36,639
levels as well and co2 but probably

905
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:38,078
they're focused on light

906
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:41,039
and

907
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:43,519
you know when we work with growers in

908
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:47,119
vertical farms and they're growing say

909
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:48,960
lettuce and arugula and basil

910
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:50,240
one of the recommendations that i'll

911
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:54,000
give them

912
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:55,279
is i'll say look arugula is a cool

913
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,800
weather plant

914
00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:01,680
lettuce is a mild weather plant

915
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:04,560
and basil is a hot weather plant there's

916
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:06,879
a reason why tomatoes and basils

917
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:08,400
are good companion plants well there are

918
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,240
several reasons but one of which is that

919
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,280
they both like a lot of sun and a lot of

920
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:13,199
heat

921
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,440
and the tomato plant helps shade the

922
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:18,078
basil plant they also produce chemicals

923
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,519
that protect each other um in the soil

924
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:22,000
uh you might be interested to know that

925
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:23,358
ted if you didn't know that already um

926
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,119
but

927
00:35:23,358 --> 00:35:26,400
so so here let's just say we have these

928
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:28,960
three

929
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,800
species right you have arugula lettuce

930
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:34,240
and basil and they like different

931
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:36,400
conditions so what i'll tell growers is

932
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:38,479
look let's take advantage of that we

933
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,838
will have the outlet from the air

934
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:42,159
conditioner

935
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:44,639
start where the arugula is because it

936
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:46,639
likes cold temperatures and then it's

937
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:48,239
going to move across the lettuce plant

938
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:50,159
and then after it's picked up all that

939
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:51,919
heat and humidity from the plants and

940
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:53,759
from the lights is then going to hit the

941
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:56,240
basil plant and that basil plant is

942
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,839
going to be basking in the warmth

943
00:35:56,239 --> 00:36:00,479
and so you can literally right we can

944
00:35:57,838 --> 00:36:03,119
design this hvac system to literally

945
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:05,760
have these plants like go with the flow

946
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:06,640
um or grow with the flow uh

947
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,160
what

948
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:12,400
but with cannabis it's so hard because

949
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:13,920
i don't know the difference

950
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,039
i personally don't know the difference

951
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:18,000
between

952
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:20,400
i don't know what you know gorilla glue

953
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,239
likes and what

954
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,400
i don't know super glue likes and maybe

955
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:25,519
they're both because they're they're you

956
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,559
know

957
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:28,480
i don't know

958
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:31,759
you know or what an indica versus a

959
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:34,400
sativa uh like and and i've had growers

960
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:36,640
say well this indica this is an indica

961
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:39,760
but it grows like a sativa

962
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:40,719
or i have this sativa that grows like an

963
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:43,920
indica

964
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:45,598
and you know it's like oh

965
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,760
what does that mean right are they just

966
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:49,920
talking about the physiology are they

967
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,280
talking about how they water and the

968
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,119
nutrients they give it are they talking

969
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,280
about the lights that it like right like

970
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:56,720
i mean there's when you say one is like

971
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,720
the other

972
00:36:56,719 --> 00:37:01,199
what what is the grower thinking that

973
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:03,519
that means and i bet it's different for

974
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:04,879
every single grower um

975
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:07,679
and and so

976
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,880
you know ideally

977
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:12,000
ideally

978
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:13,920
again we find these specific genetic

979
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,639
strains that everybody agrees on and we

980
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:18,960
can start there or if growers are doing

981
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:20,719
their own internal r d they're looking

982
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,639
at all the variables and not just

983
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:25,358
focused on one

984
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:26,480
to figure out you know which which of

985
00:37:25,358 --> 00:37:29,039
their

986
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:32,079
cultivars and strains

987
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:34,960
like are like each other in all the ways

988
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:37,599
not just one way

989
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:40,559
yeah as as a scientist and an engineer i

990
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:42,599
i can understand your uh

991
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:46,000
desire for

992
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:46,720
consistency across genetics

993
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,400
uh

994
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:51,279
but the challenge there the counterpoint

995
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:53,760
to that is uh one commercial growers

996
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,839
need to grow the high cultivars the hype

997
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,200
strains that people want in the market

998
00:37:55,838 --> 00:37:58,239
you have to be able to sell

999
00:37:57,199 --> 00:38:00,000
your product

1000
00:37:58,239 --> 00:38:03,118
so that's one thing the second thing i

1001
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,119
would add to that is

1002
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:08,399
we don't really know exactly

1003
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:10,399
what the medicinal capabilities of this

1004
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,880
plant are and so exploring the genetic

1005
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:14,960
diversity is really important at this

1006
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:17,599
stage of the game and i think that will

1007
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:19,440
continue uh as we learn more about the

1008
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:20,880
entourage effect and what how the

1009
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,039
terpenes and cannabinoids and all these

1010
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:26,720
different phytochemical responses

1011
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:28,000
create a certain uh you know effect

1012
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:29,919
for

1013
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,639
various human beings that are dealing

1014
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,280
with

1015
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:35,358
different ailments so

1016
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:38,079
as nice as it would be to have everyone

1017
00:38:35,358 --> 00:38:40,400
grow uh big macs i just don't think

1018
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:42,240
we're at that point in history right now

1019
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:45,039
like we are with other commercial crops

1020
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:47,919
due to some of these medicinal qualities

1021
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:51,039
but um i get it

1022
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:53,760
that's a very good point um and you know

1023
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:55,039
just a couple of thoughts about that

1024
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,280
one is

1025
00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:59,119
you know for for greenhouse growers uh

1026
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:01,440
who do have control over their

1027
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:05,358
environment maybe not as precise and

1028
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:07,599
consistent as an indoor facility um you

1029
00:39:05,358 --> 00:39:10,639
know greenhouses are

1030
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:12,160
are more susceptible to their external

1031
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:12,960
environment right whether it's a cloudy

1032
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:16,480
day

1033
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:18,000
or a really hot sunny day or freezing

1034
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,599
cold day

1035
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,119
you know

1036
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:22,960
you you have to

1037
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:26,480
you have to be able to live within a

1038
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:29,119
larger range of conditions or be able to

1039
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:30,880
cultivate your plant and make those

1040
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:33,760
adjustments right

1041
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:36,880
necessary to to keep your plant healthy

1042
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:39,680
and productive even when you don't have

1043
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:41,920
the ideal situation

1044
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:43,679
and and i've been really impressed with

1045
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:45,358
some of our clients and some of the

1046
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:47,440
growers that we've talked to

1047
00:39:45,358 --> 00:39:50,960
who are

1048
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:54,079
who are looking for genetics

1049
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:56,880
that fit their environment

1050
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:59,519
as opposed to trying to force an

1051
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:02,320
environment on a specific strain so if

1052
00:39:59,519 --> 00:40:04,480
you're you know in texas or florida

1053
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:06,400
um or you know somewhere that's that's

1054
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,760
really humid

1055
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,480
finding

1056
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,520
genetics finding strains

1057
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,240
that

1058
00:40:11,519 --> 00:40:15,199
are

1059
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:16,000
less susceptible to mold pressures in a

1060
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:18,480
high

1061
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,358
high humidity environment

1062
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:24,639
is going to make your life so much

1063
00:40:21,358 --> 00:40:26,719
better and probably the cost of

1064
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:29,199
installation and production a lot lower

1065
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:31,439
because you're not trying to install air

1066
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:33,199
conditioners or dehumidifiers or these

1067
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:36,480
you know super power hungry pieces of

1068
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:39,039
equipment to dry your greenhouse out to

1069
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:41,199
grow a strain that likes it dry

1070
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:42,000
um and and so

1071
00:40:41,199 --> 00:40:43,679
uh

1072
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,920
you know but that's what breeding is and

1073
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:50,078
and you know we've been breeding

1074
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:52,240
so many crops for 10 000 years and we're

1075
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:54,240
just scraping the surface here with

1076
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:55,919
cannabis and you know maybe in 10 000

1077
00:40:54,239 --> 00:41:00,078
years we'll have like the very perfect

1078
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:03,039
strains you know um that that we all uh

1079
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:05,119
can enjoy for all sorts of of um of

1080
00:41:03,039 --> 00:41:08,559
reasons um

1081
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:10,318
and and you know just in terms of

1082
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:13,119
the medicinal

1083
00:41:10,318 --> 00:41:14,639
quality use uh of

1084
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:16,800
of the cannabis

1085
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:18,719
flower of the of the plant

1086
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:21,119
uh you know it's it's similar to what

1087
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:22,480
we're learning about other horticultural

1088
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:24,160
crops that

1089
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,079
you know i'm again i'm not a lighting

1090
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:28,399
person necessarily but of course there's

1091
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:30,000
a lot of research around light

1092
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,119
but you know

1093
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,400
we know

1094
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:33,960
you know that

1095
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:37,039
par

1096
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:38,800
photosynthetically active radiation is

1097
00:41:37,039 --> 00:41:41,119
necessary for

1098
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:43,200
photosynthesis right and photosynthesis

1099
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:46,720
is growth photosynthesis is fixing

1100
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:49,679
carbon dioxide to produce carbohydrates

1101
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:53,118
but that does not necessarily translate

1102
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:55,440
into the quality characteristics of the

1103
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:58,079
plant and what we have been learning

1104
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:00,159
um for all sorts of plants is that it's

1105
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:03,280
all those sort of in between

1106
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:06,719
wavelengths it's the edge wavelengths

1107
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:08,240
that uh are responsible for color that

1108
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:09,358
are responsible

1109
00:42:08,239 --> 00:42:11,598
for

1110
00:42:09,358 --> 00:42:14,239
the you know anthocyanin that's produced

1111
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:17,599
by a red oak leaf lettuce

1112
00:42:14,239 --> 00:42:20,239
what i love about that particular

1113
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:23,280
compound that plants produce is that

1114
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:26,239
it's only produced when that

1115
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:28,720
lettuce plant is exposed to uv

1116
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:32,000
if you never expose that plant to uv it

1117
00:42:28,719 --> 00:42:35,519
would be green but the second well maybe

1118
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:37,679
minutes that it's exposed to uv light

1119
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:39,838
it produces the red color and what

1120
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:42,639
scientists think is that the anthocyanin

1121
00:42:39,838 --> 00:42:45,039
is actually the plant's natural

1122
00:42:42,639 --> 00:42:46,960
sunscreen

1123
00:42:45,039 --> 00:42:48,639
and so it's protecting itself from uv

1124
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:51,760
well we think it's a really pretty plant

1125
00:42:48,639 --> 00:42:52,960
right and we want to eat it um and so

1126
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:55,200
you know

1127
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:57,440
learning about this with with cannabis

1128
00:42:55,199 --> 00:43:00,078
as well right what are the colors what

1129
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:02,639
are the terpenes what are the the cbd

1130
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:03,920
profiles right that we can produce from

1131
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:05,920
all these

1132
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:07,280
other wavelengths of light that are not

1133
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,039
necessarily

1134
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,880
shown on the mccree curve

1135
00:43:09,039 --> 00:43:12,480
um and and i think that's really

1136
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,280
exciting

1137
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,960
and

1138
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:18,079
i think the same

1139
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:20,480
is going to be discovered with

1140
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:22,480
temperature and humidity and vpd control

1141
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:25,039
with co2 control that

1142
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:27,760
maybe by dropping the carbon dioxide

1143
00:43:25,039 --> 00:43:29,599
level to 400 parts per million

1144
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:31,599
um you know

1145
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:34,079
a during veg

1146
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:36,318
maybe produces i don't know

1147
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:38,640
a certain different quality of plant i

1148
00:43:36,318 --> 00:43:41,119
mean something that we know if you track

1149
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:42,799
global co2 levels

1150
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:45,920
is that the co2

1151
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:47,280
naturally increases from spring

1152
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:50,318
through fall

1153
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:52,319
and why does that happen well because in

1154
00:43:50,318 --> 00:43:53,759
the spring and the summer right plants

1155
00:43:52,318 --> 00:43:55,920
are growing really quickly and they're

1156
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:58,400
consuming the carbon dioxide that's in

1157
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:00,400
the atmosphere and then as they're dying

1158
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:02,400
they're actually their respiration rates

1159
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,519
start to take over their photosynthesis

1160
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,680
rates right they don't need to grow

1161
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:08,239
anymore in the fall they're dying now

1162
00:44:05,679 --> 00:44:11,039
and so that death is is actually

1163
00:44:08,239 --> 00:44:13,279
releasing co2 and there's less plant

1164
00:44:11,039 --> 00:44:15,039
matter to absorb that co2

1165
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:17,040
so maybe

1166
00:44:15,039 --> 00:44:19,838
i don't know maybe a cannabis plant

1167
00:44:17,039 --> 00:44:22,159
wants lower co2 levels you know when

1168
00:44:19,838 --> 00:44:24,559
it's young or in them in a middle stage

1169
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:26,318
right high levels early because you have

1170
00:44:24,559 --> 00:44:29,199
these high levels holding over from the

1171
00:44:26,318 --> 00:44:31,279
winter and then maybe lower co2 levels

1172
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:35,199
in the middle of its life and then boost

1173
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:36,800
it again in late flower when we already

1174
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:39,118
know that co2 levels are high in the

1175
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:40,800
atmosphere i don't know i just literally

1176
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:43,838
made that up right now on the fly while

1177
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:45,680
talking to you but

1178
00:44:43,838 --> 00:44:48,159
i mean but that that's the type of right

1179
00:44:45,679 --> 00:44:51,279
like that's the type of science um that

1180
00:44:48,159 --> 00:44:54,399
is so interesting um about growing any

1181
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:56,640
plant i think um and and the fact that

1182
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:59,200
we get to control those variables by

1183
00:44:56,639 --> 00:45:01,358
growing in greenhouses and growing

1184
00:44:59,199 --> 00:45:02,639
indoors um

1185
00:45:01,358 --> 00:45:04,000
i don't know that's the fun that's

1186
00:45:02,639 --> 00:45:06,239
that's why i'm doing what i'm doing it's

1187
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,880
exciting

1188
00:45:06,239 --> 00:45:11,199
yeah so two main takeaways i have from

1189
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:13,440
what we've talked about so far is one we

1190
00:45:11,199 --> 00:45:15,598
can't look at any one of these variables

1191
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:17,039
uh in a vacuum they all relate to each

1192
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:18,880
other and so when we're talking about

1193
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:21,279
lighting or we're talking about vpd or

1194
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:23,200
we're talking about co2 we really need

1195
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:25,599
to be talking about all of these things

1196
00:45:23,199 --> 00:45:27,519
in in conjunction

1197
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:28,960
uh and then my other thought relating to

1198
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:30,960
all this is when we look at research

1199
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:34,400
that's been done we have to realize that

1200
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:37,519
that research was done on a particular

1201
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:38,960
you know strains particular genetics and

1202
00:45:37,519 --> 00:45:41,440
that that may not

1203
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:42,960
appropriately apply exactly to our

1204
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:46,079
environment so we can't say you know

1205
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:49,519
this is optimal co2 in in this facility

1206
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:50,400
um this is optimal vpd this is optimal

1207
00:45:49,519 --> 00:45:51,358
um

1208
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:54,639
you know

1209
00:45:51,358 --> 00:45:56,400
par levels we we need to take that data

1210
00:45:54,639 --> 00:45:59,279
and assimilate it and then try and

1211
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:00,720
extrapolate how this might apply to our

1212
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:02,960
personal

1213
00:46:00,719 --> 00:46:05,519
situation i guess or room for our plants

1214
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:07,199
and and those genetics does that yeah is

1215
00:46:05,519 --> 00:46:09,280
that fair to say

1216
00:46:07,199 --> 00:46:11,919
absolutely yeah you nailed it and you

1217
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:15,280
know if i were a grower i would probably

1218
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:17,519
pick my my favorite strains you know

1219
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:20,880
and what's a favorite strain it's you

1220
00:46:17,519 --> 00:46:24,000
know super robust and and you know never

1221
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:25,440
gets powdery mildew or maybe it has low

1222
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,318
yields but

1223
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:29,200
uh really high thc quality or maybe just

1224
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:31,358
you know

1225
00:46:29,199 --> 00:46:32,399
people just love it uh for whatever

1226
00:46:31,358 --> 00:46:34,400
reason

1227
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:36,880
you know starting with those few strains

1228
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:39,280
and and if you have an r d room you know

1229
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:41,280
try to find what

1230
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:45,760
at least co2

1231
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:48,480
temperature vpd and light levels are

1232
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:50,400
you know those combinations work best

1233
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:51,920
for your plant

1234
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,680
and

1235
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:55,680
and then you know

1236
00:46:53,679 --> 00:46:57,759
and then grow those plants maybe even

1237
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:59,598
with all of its sister

1238
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:02,480
strains that you have there but now

1239
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:04,559
you've optimized the environment for

1240
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:07,440
your quote unquote favorite right and

1241
00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:09,039
the others um are they're gonna grow

1242
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,880
right they're good they're gonna be fine

1243
00:47:09,039 --> 00:47:12,960
but they're just not gonna be optimized

1244
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:15,039
or ideally you're growing you know one

1245
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:17,199
or two very similar

1246
00:47:15,039 --> 00:47:19,039
strains in the same space

1247
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:21,118
which is an argument for having smaller

1248
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:23,039
rooms right of having rooms that are

1249
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:26,160
maybe a thousand or two thousand square

1250
00:47:23,039 --> 00:47:28,558
feet as opposed to a room that's six or

1251
00:47:26,159 --> 00:47:30,799
ten thousand square feet where you know

1252
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:32,640
if you have ten thousand square feet of

1253
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:35,359
a flower room

1254
00:47:32,639 --> 00:47:38,159
you are absolutely going to have a lot

1255
00:47:35,358 --> 00:47:39,598
of strains that you're growing and it's

1256
00:47:38,159 --> 00:47:42,480
just going to make it even more

1257
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:45,119
challenging to find the sweet spot where

1258
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:47,599
all of those strains are are able to to

1259
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:49,119
grow well

1260
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:50,240
so

1261
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:52,000
yeah

1262
00:47:50,239 --> 00:47:54,000
and and you know i i want to make sure

1263
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,400
that people realize too that you know

1264
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,800
it's it's we're talking a lot about the

1265
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:01,680
upper environment around you know the

1266
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:04,880
leafy part of the plant but what happens

1267
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:07,838
at the root level is also impacted by

1268
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:09,838
what happens um above

1269
00:48:07,838 --> 00:48:12,318
right um

1270
00:48:09,838 --> 00:48:15,039
everything from you know your your

1271
00:48:12,318 --> 00:48:17,838
nutrient levels and and how frequently

1272
00:48:15,039 --> 00:48:20,880
and how much you water

1273
00:48:17,838 --> 00:48:24,480
to even how much evaporation

1274
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:26,400
um you get from your substrate uh that

1275
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,199
you're growing on you know we we have

1276
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:29,760
seen

1277
00:48:27,199 --> 00:48:33,838
grower you know growers are growing in

1278
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:36,240
you know five or ten or larger

1279
00:48:33,838 --> 00:48:37,920
you know pots fabric pots

1280
00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:39,838
and there's a

1281
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:43,838
large surface area

1282
00:48:39,838 --> 00:48:46,000
of exposed substrate and you know here

1283
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:49,440
here they're watering once or twice a

1284
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:51,679
day and you can very you can see like if

1285
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:54,000
they're actually tracking temperature

1286
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:56,318
and humidity in the room you can see a

1287
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:59,358
spike of water when they irrigate and

1288
00:48:56,318 --> 00:49:02,639
then you can watch the humidity

1289
00:48:59,358 --> 00:49:04,000
decline over time until they until they

1290
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:06,719
water again

1291
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,159
and that water is not coming that that

1292
00:49:06,719 --> 00:49:10,879
humidity is not necessarily coming from

1293
00:49:08,159 --> 00:49:13,679
the plant it's coming from evaporation

1294
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:16,720
from the substrate um and so we've seen

1295
00:49:13,679 --> 00:49:18,879
some growers who who sort of create like

1296
00:49:16,719 --> 00:49:20,719
a cover around the substrate but then

1297
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:23,119
you have to be careful with that because

1298
00:49:20,719 --> 00:49:28,399
then you might not get good oxygenation

1299
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:29,440
and breathing um around the roots so um

1300
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:31,519
you know

1301
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:33,920
and and then if we ask the the hvac

1302
00:49:31,519 --> 00:49:36,400
system to be really dynamic and

1303
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:39,039
dehumidify more during a watering event

1304
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:40,800
and then dehumidify less you know you

1305
00:49:39,039 --> 00:49:44,719
know later

1306
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:48,480
hvac equipment it can only do so much um

1307
00:49:44,719 --> 00:49:51,199
and and it's not super responsive um you

1308
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:52,079
know it tries to respond but

1309
00:49:51,199 --> 00:49:53,679
you know

1310
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:55,920
you're let's just say you're in like a 2

1311
00:49:53,679 --> 00:49:58,159
000 square foot room

1312
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:00,880
where do you have your sensors how many

1313
00:49:58,159 --> 00:50:03,118
sensors do you have are you averaging

1314
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:05,920
are you controlling based off of a peak

1315
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:08,079
temperature or humidity right so so the

1316
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:10,720
bigger the room you have you know you

1317
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:12,640
can expect to have more variability

1318
00:50:10,719 --> 00:50:15,039
um but also

1319
00:50:12,639 --> 00:50:17,679
your hvac system

1320
00:50:15,039 --> 00:50:21,119
can only control to the inputs that it

1321
00:50:17,679 --> 00:50:23,759
gets um and so you know it's not going

1322
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:26,000
to react really really quickly

1323
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:28,000
which is why you see those those spikes

1324
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,838
when lights first turn on or when lights

1325
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,559
first turn off because

1326
00:50:29,838 --> 00:50:35,358
your your ac unit needs a minute well it

1327
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:37,839
probably needs about five minutes um to

1328
00:50:35,358 --> 00:50:40,239
actually respond to that change which is

1329
00:50:37,838 --> 00:50:42,558
why it's great when growers dim their

1330
00:50:40,239 --> 00:50:44,239
lights do a sunrise sunset type of

1331
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:46,880
schedule

1332
00:50:44,239 --> 00:50:47,838
or if they have a sophisticated control

1333
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:51,760
system

1334
00:50:47,838 --> 00:50:52,719
they can they can actually program

1335
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:53,599
their

1336
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:57,199
their

1337
00:50:53,599 --> 00:51:00,000
control algorithm to start ramping up

1338
00:50:57,199 --> 00:51:01,759
right or ramping down uh depending on

1339
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,960
when the lights are going to turn on or

1340
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:07,520
off to sort of anticipate a big change

1341
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:10,159
in the environment

1342
00:51:07,519 --> 00:51:11,920
so you know when it comes to monitoring

1343
00:51:10,159 --> 00:51:13,358
and controls

1344
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:15,440
um

1345
00:51:13,358 --> 00:51:16,799
it's it's really important to think

1346
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:18,079
about

1347
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:20,640
um

1348
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:22,079
not only the the capacity of your

1349
00:51:20,639 --> 00:51:24,000
equipment and can it pull out all of

1350
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:25,519
that humidity can it can it control

1351
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,920
temperature and remove all that heat

1352
00:51:25,519 --> 00:51:30,559
from the lights but also how quickly can

1353
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:32,720
it respond is it going to go into

1354
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:34,480
a defrost cycle i can't even tell you

1355
00:51:32,719 --> 00:51:36,558
how many clients now that we've had

1356
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:38,400
where we've helped them troubleshoot

1357
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:41,839
that all of a sudden their system stops

1358
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:44,160
dehumidifying and it starts heating and

1359
00:51:41,838 --> 00:51:46,719
that equipment went into

1360
00:51:44,159 --> 00:51:48,318
like just a standard defrost cycle for

1361
00:51:46,719 --> 00:51:51,118
five minutes and they literally lose

1362
00:51:48,318 --> 00:51:53,199
control for five minutes of of their

1363
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:55,200
room um and so then we're like can we

1364
00:51:53,199 --> 00:51:57,118
disable it can we change the frequency

1365
00:51:55,199 --> 00:52:00,159
you know like all these different things

1366
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:02,318
um and and just understanding

1367
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:04,480
what your equipment can do and why it's

1368
00:52:02,318 --> 00:52:06,639
doing what it does um

1369
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:09,358
you know is is important you know if

1370
00:52:06,639 --> 00:52:10,799
nothing else for just your sanity

1371
00:52:09,358 --> 00:52:13,039
um

1372
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:14,880
yeah

1373
00:52:13,039 --> 00:52:17,599
yeah i mean that's one of the reasons

1374
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:18,720
that i like uh using the the blue matte

1375
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:21,440
systems

1376
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:22,879
uh when they where they make sense uh

1377
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:24,800
just just for the idea that you're

1378
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:27,838
getting uh water

1379
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:30,480
uh to the plants at a lower

1380
00:52:27,838 --> 00:52:32,719
rate and so it's more consistent so you

1381
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,679
don't see is humidity spikes they're not

1382
00:52:32,719 --> 00:52:35,279
for every

1383
00:52:33,679 --> 00:52:37,838
they're not for every uh

1384
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:40,000
growing situation for sure and they have

1385
00:52:37,838 --> 00:52:41,759
pros and cons um

1386
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,719
but which i'm happy to talk about with

1387
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:47,119
anyone who's interested in that sort of

1388
00:52:44,719 --> 00:52:48,719
irrigation system uh because we do work

1389
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:50,240
with them but uh

1390
00:52:48,719 --> 00:52:52,000
that is one perk to them that i just

1391
00:52:50,239 --> 00:52:54,000
want to mention now

1392
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,760
one other thing that you talked about in

1393
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,199
terms of how you know the challenges

1394
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:59,680
around all this genetic diversity and

1395
00:52:57,199 --> 00:53:01,279
everything and optimizing it you know we

1396
00:52:59,679 --> 00:53:02,480
see the same thing with soils and media

1397
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,359
and i just want to touch on that because

1398
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:05,358
people

1399
00:53:03,358 --> 00:53:06,719
think that there's like a best soil out

1400
00:53:05,358 --> 00:53:08,078
there well

1401
00:53:06,719 --> 00:53:08,959
there really isn't

1402
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:11,440
you know

1403
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:13,599
as someone who formulates soil and

1404
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:14,960
nutrients like i'm trying to come up

1405
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:16,318
with one that's going to it's almost

1406
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:19,599
like a shotgun approach what's going to

1407
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:23,199
work in most situations for most plants

1408
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:25,119
to create you know they're adequate

1409
00:53:23,199 --> 00:53:26,719
needs so we won't see any issues with

1410
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:28,559
deficiencies and everything will be at

1411
00:53:26,719 --> 00:53:29,759
sufficiency but

1412
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:31,359
you know one of the things that i like

1413
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:33,119
to do with the growers that we work with

1414
00:53:31,358 --> 00:53:34,480
is

1415
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:36,400
looking at all these variables that we

1416
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:38,960
talk about is also from a nutrient

1417
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:41,039
perspective then do testing so that we

1418
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:43,920
can customize the nutrients that we're

1419
00:53:41,039 --> 00:53:45,279
sending them for their media and and and

1420
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:47,200
their cultivars that they're running in

1421
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:49,519
their environment as we see these tests

1422
00:53:47,199 --> 00:53:52,159
over time so collecting that data we can

1423
00:53:49,519 --> 00:53:54,318
start dialing these things in on the on

1424
00:53:52,159 --> 00:53:56,558
the nutrient side and you know it would

1425
00:53:54,318 --> 00:53:59,679
be the same i assume on the hvac side

1426
00:53:56,559 --> 00:54:01,359
and the environmental control side

1427
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:04,480
in terms of that data collection and

1428
00:54:01,358 --> 00:54:07,598
slowly optimizing these targets

1429
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:07,599
based off of that data

1430
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:13,838
yeah i mean

1431
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:16,719
for for you and when thinking about

1432
00:54:13,838 --> 00:54:18,078
soils i mean how do you decide what is

1433
00:54:16,719 --> 00:54:21,439
the right

1434
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:24,960
water capacity or irrigation frequency

1435
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:27,838
or irrigation methodology i mean are you

1436
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:30,400
also looking at what's happening in the

1437
00:54:27,838 --> 00:54:32,159
environment around the the top of the

1438
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:34,079
plant um

1439
00:54:32,159 --> 00:54:36,798
how i mean how

1440
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:39,760
how do you see those interactions

1441
00:54:36,798 --> 00:54:41,280
playing out

1442
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:42,240
well i'll start by saying i'm still

1443
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:43,599
learning

1444
00:54:42,239 --> 00:54:43,789
this is interesting you're interviewing

1445
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:46,240
me

1446
00:54:43,789 --> 00:54:48,239
[Laughter]

1447
00:54:46,239 --> 00:54:51,279
you know i i think i think we're still

1448
00:54:48,239 --> 00:54:53,679
learning what i try to do is stay i

1449
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:56,319
think by narrowing the range of

1450
00:54:53,679 --> 00:55:00,000
variability in

1451
00:54:56,318 --> 00:55:01,519
in terms of the the media and water so

1452
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,838
that we can keep it within a narrower

1453
00:55:01,519 --> 00:55:05,199
range creates uh

1454
00:55:03,838 --> 00:55:07,039
better outcomes

1455
00:55:05,199 --> 00:55:08,798
so by using

1456
00:55:07,039 --> 00:55:11,679
you know blue mass for example we're

1457
00:55:08,798 --> 00:55:12,798
able to reduce the fluctuations

1458
00:55:11,679 --> 00:55:15,440
in

1459
00:55:12,798 --> 00:55:17,199
in the water in the water uh in the soil

1460
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:18,400
and by doing that we we tend to see

1461
00:55:17,199 --> 00:55:21,199
better

1462
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:23,519
better overall growth in yields um and i

1463
00:55:21,199 --> 00:55:26,078
you know we have targets that we aim for

1464
00:55:23,519 --> 00:55:27,519
in our media but as like one thing you

1465
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:29,359
mentioned is every media is going to be

1466
00:55:27,519 --> 00:55:31,280
a little different so the amount of like

1467
00:55:29,358 --> 00:55:32,239
peat or if you're using actual soil or

1468
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:34,000
cocoa

1469
00:55:32,239 --> 00:55:35,279
whatever your whatever your media is is

1470
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,960
going to have slightly different water

1471
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:40,640
holding capacities um and so all of

1472
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:44,159
those things need to be factored in when

1473
00:55:40,639 --> 00:55:44,960
we look at how you know what an optimal

1474
00:55:44,159 --> 00:55:47,679
uh

1475
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:49,199
soil moisture level is and so i think

1476
00:55:47,679 --> 00:55:51,199
it's a complicated question i think

1477
00:55:49,199 --> 00:55:54,318
we're still learning and i have a pretty

1478
00:55:51,199 --> 00:55:55,598
good idea for my soils or soils that

1479
00:55:54,318 --> 00:55:56,558
have similar

1480
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:59,599
base

1481
00:55:56,559 --> 00:56:01,440
uh materials but beyond that you know i

1482
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:03,920
think uh i think we're still learning

1483
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:05,440
and and i think that's exciting

1484
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:08,720
it is it is

1485
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:11,599
yeah you know um

1486
00:56:08,719 --> 00:56:12,399
when it comes to to water

1487
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:14,000
uh

1488
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:16,480
you know i was talking when i was

1489
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:18,960
talking about vpd and when it's you know

1490
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:20,719
the vpd is really high and and the air

1491
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:22,559
is really dry

1492
00:56:20,719 --> 00:56:25,118
that your plant

1493
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:28,400
is you know there's more pressure vapor

1494
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:31,358
pressure on your plant to to transpire

1495
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:33,838
and to suck water through it right from

1496
00:56:31,358 --> 00:56:36,639
the roots um if you

1497
00:56:33,838 --> 00:56:40,239
if the water is not there

1498
00:56:36,639 --> 00:56:42,400
you are more likely going to see a plant

1499
00:56:40,239 --> 00:56:44,879
start to wilt because it's not a

1500
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:47,039
well-watered plant

1501
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:49,519
and so then you need to water more

1502
00:56:47,039 --> 00:56:52,719
frequently right and oh by the way you

1503
00:56:49,519 --> 00:56:54,000
may also need to adjust your nutrient

1504
00:56:52,719 --> 00:56:56,159
levels

1505
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:59,838
because your plant is going to be

1506
00:56:56,159 --> 00:57:01,440
sucking water so quickly that um

1507
00:56:59,838 --> 00:57:02,798
you know you might need to add more

1508
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:03,920
calcium

1509
00:57:02,798 --> 00:57:05,440
because

1510
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,720
you need to make sure some calcium gets

1511
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:08,559
to the plant so that you don't have that

1512
00:57:06,719 --> 00:57:10,558
calcium deficiency

1513
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:12,480
or you may need to add more nutrients

1514
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:15,200
because the plant is you know is growing

1515
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:17,679
so quickly that it needs more nutrients

1516
00:57:15,199 --> 00:57:21,598
to pull through there on the other hand

1517
00:57:17,679 --> 00:57:25,440
if you're if if your vpd is really low

1518
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:25,440
and the humidity is really high

1519
00:57:25,519 --> 00:57:28,318
then

1520
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:30,240
you probably don't need to water as

1521
00:57:28,318 --> 00:57:33,679
frequently because your plants aren't

1522
00:57:30,239 --> 00:57:34,798
going to be transpiring as quickly um

1523
00:57:33,679 --> 00:57:35,838
and so

1524
00:57:34,798 --> 00:57:38,000
uh

1525
00:57:35,838 --> 00:57:40,239
you know your your water frequency and

1526
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,760
your nutrient levels could actually be

1527
00:57:40,239 --> 00:57:44,558
lower

1528
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:46,000
and it's

1529
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:48,960
kind of

1530
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:51,280
another way to think about this is that

1531
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:54,720
by lowering the vapor pressure deficit

1532
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:56,160
by actually having a slightly more humid

1533
00:57:54,719 --> 00:58:00,480
environment

1534
00:57:56,159 --> 00:58:02,558
we can conserve water and nutrients

1535
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:03,679
i mean think about that i mean what a

1536
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:06,480
cool way

1537
00:58:03,679 --> 00:58:08,879
to conserve water

1538
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:10,880
yeah so there's a few topics that i'm

1539
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:12,160
going to have to have you back on uh in

1540
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:14,559
the near future we're gonna have to do a

1541
00:58:12,159 --> 00:58:17,679
part two because we haven't talked about

1542
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:19,839
water use efficiency and how

1543
00:58:17,679 --> 00:58:21,519
you know one aspect of agriculture is

1544
00:58:19,838 --> 00:58:22,880
that it uses a ton of water i was just

1545
00:58:21,519 --> 00:58:25,199
talking with kelly vance over at

1546
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:26,880
beneficial and he was saying like

1547
00:58:25,199 --> 00:58:29,039
something like seven gallons of water is

1548
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:30,720
required to grow an almond and

1549
00:58:29,039 --> 00:58:33,838
you know a lot of these different crops

1550
00:58:30,719 --> 00:58:36,558
require a lot of water and we're wasting

1551
00:58:33,838 --> 00:58:39,358
water when we have drought and and you

1552
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:41,440
know it's such water is such a huge

1553
00:58:39,358 --> 00:58:43,679
issue right now um

1554
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:44,960
for us as a society so i i want to talk

1555
00:58:43,679 --> 00:58:47,118
about that we haven't talked about

1556
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:48,960
resource use efficiency

1557
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:51,039
we haven't talked about the benefits of

1558
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:53,519
using different sensors

1559
00:58:51,039 --> 00:58:55,759
i want to talk to you personally about

1560
00:58:53,519 --> 00:58:58,239
living soils and vertical grow and

1561
00:58:55,760 --> 00:59:01,599
airflow and biomass and the amount of

1562
00:58:58,239 --> 00:59:03,679
soil and how all those things relate

1563
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:05,838
and i want to talk about air filtration

1564
00:59:03,679 --> 00:59:07,519
with viruses and bacteria being such a

1565
00:59:05,838 --> 00:59:08,639
hot topic these days

1566
00:59:07,519 --> 00:59:11,358
those are all topics we haven't even

1567
00:59:08,639 --> 00:59:13,358
gotten to there is one topic that i

1568
00:59:11,358 --> 00:59:14,719
absolutely have to get in this podcast

1569
00:59:13,358 --> 00:59:16,719
though because

1570
00:59:14,719 --> 00:59:18,480
i get asked this question all the time

1571
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:20,000
and i think you might have some some

1572
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:22,240
good feedback

1573
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,960
people want to know about curing and

1574
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:27,598
optimal environments for curing

1575
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:30,000
ah caring yes and there isn't a lot of

1576
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:34,798
research out there on this

1577
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:36,159
what can you add to uh this topic um

1578
00:59:34,798 --> 00:59:38,159
sorry i didn't prep you or warn you i

1579
00:59:36,159 --> 00:59:40,558
was gonna ask you this no no it's it's

1580
00:59:38,159 --> 00:59:42,399
totally fine

1581
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:44,559
what could you share about it i guess

1582
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:46,318
yeah sure and and by caring i'm assuming

1583
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:48,400
you also mean drawing because usually

1584
00:59:46,318 --> 00:59:50,239
the two kind of going hand in hand

1585
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:51,920
though they are somewhat different

1586
00:59:50,239 --> 00:59:54,479
processes

1587
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:56,559
yes and we're finding that uh one you

1588
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:58,400
know one interesting anecdote about this

1589
00:59:56,559 --> 01:00:01,040
is the market has changed from wanting

1590
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:02,798
you know 10 years ago these

1591
01:00:01,039 --> 01:00:05,679
long cured

1592
01:00:02,798 --> 01:00:08,719
uh you know cannabis flower to now it's

1593
01:00:05,679 --> 01:00:11,358
about having freshly dried

1594
01:00:08,719 --> 01:00:12,959
cannabis flower in terms of preserving

1595
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:14,719
terpenes because you know all of these

1596
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:17,119
things are going to slowly

1597
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:19,838
uh dissipate over time we're going to

1598
01:00:17,119 --> 01:00:22,000
you know we're going to lose

1599
01:00:19,838 --> 01:00:24,719
certain certain things so

1600
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:26,559
how do we best dry

1601
01:00:24,719 --> 01:00:30,318
cannabis from an environmental

1602
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:32,640
perspective in your experience

1603
01:00:30,318 --> 01:00:37,838
yeah in in our experience thank you for

1604
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:37,838
um the disclaimer so um you know we

1605
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:42,400
so so drying and curing are slightly

1606
01:00:40,639 --> 01:00:45,118
different sometimes we see them

1607
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:47,280
happening in the same room

1608
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:48,798
you know in sequential days sometimes

1609
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:52,480
there's a specific dry room and a

1610
01:00:48,798 --> 01:00:54,719
specific cure or product storage room

1611
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:57,838
which we see that being called that now

1612
01:00:54,719 --> 01:01:00,480
as well uh you know with drying our goal

1613
01:00:57,838 --> 01:01:03,440
is to suck out

1614
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:05,280
at least 50 of the moisture or i i

1615
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:08,400
really i should say 40 percent of the

1616
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:11,200
moisture as quickly as possible

1617
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:13,920
and and i say 40 specifically because i

1618
01:01:11,199 --> 01:01:15,199
made a comment very early in this

1619
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:18,000
podcast

1620
01:01:15,199 --> 01:01:20,078
that at a 60

1621
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,599
moisture content you have the highest

1622
01:01:20,079 --> 01:01:25,359
water activity

1623
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:28,880
of of molds and spores and bacteria so

1624
01:01:25,358 --> 01:01:34,078
if we can drop the water content um you

1625
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:38,160
know by 40 percent then we are going to

1626
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:39,440
really avoid the growth of those

1627
01:01:38,159 --> 01:01:43,199
diseases

1628
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:45,838
and avoid that a lot of our growers are

1629
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:49,279
saying you know help us to

1630
01:01:45,838 --> 01:01:51,119
remove you know 40 to 50 percent of the

1631
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:53,040
the total moisture content we're going

1632
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:55,039
to remove so let's just say that you

1633
01:01:53,039 --> 01:01:56,960
know the

1634
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:59,280
the final moisture content that they're

1635
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:03,760
going to try to achieve is is 12 right

1636
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:05,200
somewhere between 10 and 13 or 14

1637
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:07,760
that

1638
01:02:05,199 --> 01:02:09,519
they want to get it down to you know

1639
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:12,640
40 or 50

1640
01:02:09,519 --> 01:02:13,920
in the first 24 hours

1641
01:02:12,639 --> 01:02:17,279
now

1642
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:18,639
doing that uh is pretty intensive

1643
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:20,240
and and

1644
01:02:18,639 --> 01:02:22,078
kind of the challenge is that we're

1645
01:02:20,239 --> 01:02:24,558
trying to remove 50

1646
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:28,640
on day one and then we're trying to

1647
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:32,480
remove the remaining say 30

1648
01:02:28,639 --> 01:02:34,078
over the course of the next eight or 10

1649
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:37,440
days

1650
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:41,200
and and and just do sort of a slow burn

1651
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:43,200
so day one is to prevent contamination

1652
01:02:41,199 --> 01:02:46,798
and the rest of the time

1653
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:48,159
is to preserve those terpenes and

1654
01:02:46,798 --> 01:02:49,838
trichomes and the quality

1655
01:02:48,159 --> 01:02:51,358
characteristics that you just spent the

1656
01:02:49,838 --> 01:02:54,880
last you know

1657
01:02:51,358 --> 01:02:56,880
16 weeks developing

1658
01:02:54,880 --> 01:03:00,079
and and we don't want to dry it so

1659
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:02,000
quickly in the the last you know eight

1660
01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:04,079
days of the drying cycle or whatever

1661
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:06,000
that that final period is because we

1662
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:08,960
don't want to um

1663
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:10,159
we don't want to vaporize the oil

1664
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:12,000
that

1665
01:03:10,159 --> 01:03:14,159
is in those trichomes right we want to

1666
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,838
preserve that as part of the drying

1667
01:03:14,159 --> 01:03:18,879
process

1668
01:03:15,838 --> 01:03:22,400
and and if we over dehumidify if we try

1669
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:24,318
to if we try to remove continue removing

1670
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:27,519
the same rate of moisture that we did on

1671
01:03:24,318 --> 01:03:30,159
day one um then we're gonna lose a lot

1672
01:03:27,519 --> 01:03:31,759
of those oils and terpenes in the

1673
01:03:30,159 --> 01:03:33,440
process

1674
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:36,799
so i you know

1675
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:39,119
day one fifty percent moisture removal

1676
01:03:36,798 --> 01:03:42,880
if you can if you can't do it in 24

1677
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:44,880
hours then you know 48 and 72 hours

1678
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:47,200
but we're really pushing it if we go

1679
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:48,960
beyond 48 hours i would say pushing it

1680
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:50,480
in terms of you know risk of

1681
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:52,079
contamination

1682
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:54,000
but the you know

1683
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:56,240
fi again you know i had mentioned that

1684
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:58,798
hvac equipment

1685
01:03:56,239 --> 01:04:00,318
doesn't doesn't respond really quickly

1686
01:03:58,798 --> 01:04:03,199
and doesn't really like a lot of

1687
01:04:00,318 --> 01:04:04,318
variability if it can help it

1688
01:04:03,199 --> 01:04:07,919
and so

1689
01:04:04,318 --> 01:04:10,639
a lot of times we have a different hvac

1690
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:13,280
system that's operating on day one

1691
01:04:10,639 --> 01:04:15,598
then we do the rest of the time

1692
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:16,880
um and and so

1693
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:18,720
you know because because we want to do

1694
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:20,960
as much dehumidification as possible on

1695
01:04:18,719 --> 01:04:24,239
day one and then just a little the rest

1696
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:27,599
of the time and it is almost impossible

1697
01:04:24,239 --> 01:04:30,639
to find an hvac unit that can go from

1698
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:32,559
you know zero to a hundred um

1699
01:04:30,639 --> 01:04:34,879
in the blink of an eye

1700
01:04:32,559 --> 01:04:37,039
so so that's that's kind of the drying

1701
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:39,519
process and then i will say that airflow

1702
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:42,240
is really essential

1703
01:04:39,519 --> 01:04:45,199
i love it when growers are using hanging

1704
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:47,118
racks that is fairly easy for us to move

1705
01:04:45,199 --> 01:04:48,558
air through whether it's vertically or

1706
01:04:47,119 --> 01:04:50,240
horizontally

1707
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:52,720
baker's racks

1708
01:04:50,239 --> 01:04:55,118
oh my god what a [ __ ] that's worse than

1709
01:04:52,719 --> 01:04:58,558
vertical farming um you know i mean you

1710
01:04:55,119 --> 01:05:01,680
have such a narrow gap of trying to move

1711
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:03,359
air through those those those flower

1712
01:05:01,679 --> 01:05:05,919
buds um

1713
01:05:03,358 --> 01:05:06,880
i just i want those to go away i'll be

1714
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:10,480
honest

1715
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:12,640
um and then when it comes to curing

1716
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:14,480
uh you know something that we've started

1717
01:05:12,639 --> 01:05:16,639
doing because there's this whole burping

1718
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:18,400
thing right and and what we're trying to

1719
01:05:16,639 --> 01:05:19,838
do is you know

1720
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:22,160
you've you've

1721
01:05:19,838 --> 01:05:24,400
you've trimmed the the buds and now you

1722
01:05:22,159 --> 01:05:26,078
have them in these bins or these buckets

1723
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:27,280
or containers you know whatever you want

1724
01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:28,318
to call it

1725
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:30,960
and

1726
01:05:28,318 --> 01:05:33,759
um they're they're off-gassing right and

1727
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:36,000
and they're curing themselves and

1728
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:38,079
in that off-gassing we want we burp

1729
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:41,358
right we burp that container to

1730
01:05:38,079 --> 01:05:43,440
replenish it then with oxygen uh with

1731
01:05:41,358 --> 01:05:45,279
air and there must be an oxidizer

1732
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:48,400
oxidation process that we're actually

1733
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:51,519
trying to facilitate in in all of this

1734
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:54,559
um and so we replace the the what's off

1735
01:05:51,519 --> 01:05:56,480
gas with with air in the room and then

1736
01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:59,839
we close the lid again and then you know

1737
01:05:56,480 --> 01:06:02,480
24 hours later we do the same thing

1738
01:05:59,838 --> 01:06:03,599
well what happens if we never ventilate

1739
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:05,679
this room

1740
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:07,760
right if we never bring fresh air into

1741
01:06:05,679 --> 01:06:09,519
this room is it possible that this room

1742
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:11,039
could become so filled with that

1743
01:06:09,519 --> 01:06:14,719
off-gassed

1744
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:16,960
you know compounds vocs that when we

1745
01:06:14,719 --> 01:06:19,358
burp the container when we open these

1746
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:20,240
containers we're just refilling

1747
01:06:19,358 --> 01:06:22,000
that

1748
01:06:20,239 --> 01:06:24,639
that headspace with

1749
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:26,798
the vocs that we you know let out

1750
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:29,038
yesterday um so

1751
01:06:26,798 --> 01:06:30,559
what we've been doing and working with

1752
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:33,280
growers and sort of getting their

1753
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:36,640
permission and getting good feedback on

1754
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:38,480
is providing a little bit of fresh air

1755
01:06:36,639 --> 01:06:40,798
in the cure rooms just doing a little

1756
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:43,599
bit of ventilation

1757
01:06:40,798 --> 01:06:46,079
so that we are continuously

1758
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:48,798
removing those vocs and exchanging it

1759
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:51,200
with fresh air from the outside

1760
01:06:48,798 --> 01:06:53,280
we always filter this air i don't want

1761
01:06:51,199 --> 01:06:55,519
anyone thinking that we're just bringing

1762
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:57,680
outside air through a window we're

1763
01:06:55,519 --> 01:06:59,920
definitely not doing that you know we're

1764
01:06:57,679 --> 01:07:01,279
using high efficiency filters to bring

1765
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:03,280
that air in

1766
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:05,280
we'll definitely need you know odor

1767
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:08,000
mitigation um

1768
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:09,039
you know 95 percent of the time because

1769
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:12,559
we are

1770
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:14,880
um releasing those vocs out you know to

1771
01:07:12,559 --> 01:07:16,798
the outside to the exterior of the

1772
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:17,599
building um

1773
01:07:16,798 --> 01:07:19,119
but

1774
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:21,039
what our growers are telling us is that

1775
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:24,480
they're getting good quality

1776
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:27,359
by curing with this bit of fresh air and

1777
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:29,920
just keeping that air fresh um

1778
01:07:27,358 --> 01:07:32,480
so you know the curing process

1779
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:34,480
you know it seems to happen

1780
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:37,199
i don't know i mean i i mentioned that

1781
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:39,039
you know it it has morphed some of our

1782
01:07:37,199 --> 01:07:43,038
projects the names have morphed into

1783
01:07:39,039 --> 01:07:44,960
product storage as opposed to

1784
01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:47,680
to a cure room and i think some of that

1785
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:49,679
has to do with the regulations and codes

1786
01:07:47,679 --> 01:07:51,279
in your specific jurisdiction and where

1787
01:07:49,679 --> 01:07:53,440
you're located which is why we're seeing

1788
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:55,280
such a variability in that but

1789
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:57,200
ultimately you're keeping it in that

1790
01:07:55,280 --> 01:08:00,160
same place until you

1791
01:07:57,199 --> 01:08:02,159
package it and send it off and so those

1792
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:03,598
those buds can stay in that room right

1793
01:08:02,159 --> 01:08:06,239
anywhere from

1794
01:08:03,599 --> 01:08:09,760
a couple of weeks to several months

1795
01:08:06,239 --> 01:08:11,358
um and and it's really important to

1796
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:13,839
maintain

1797
01:08:11,358 --> 01:08:16,479
a good temperature in there but really

1798
01:08:13,838 --> 01:08:17,838
when it comes to humidity and moisture

1799
01:08:16,479 --> 01:08:19,358
control

1800
01:08:17,838 --> 01:08:20,960
hopefully you know by the time you

1801
01:08:19,359 --> 01:08:22,719
finish that drying process if you've

1802
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:25,198
moved it into

1803
01:08:22,719 --> 01:08:27,119
a dedicated cure room

1804
01:08:25,198 --> 01:08:30,798
you don't want

1805
01:08:27,119 --> 01:08:31,920
your flowers to either absorb or release

1806
01:08:30,798 --> 01:08:34,000
moisture

1807
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:36,560
so when we talk about vapor pressure

1808
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:38,960
deficit this is where the science would

1809
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:41,839
really help is to know

1810
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:44,000
what is the right vpd

1811
01:08:41,838 --> 01:08:47,920
to

1812
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:49,920
basically hold that flower in stasis

1813
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:53,119
right like we don't want it to to get

1814
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:55,838
any more wet or any more dry than it is

1815
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:56,960
i mean unless that is your goal um and

1816
01:08:55,838 --> 01:08:58,079
so

1817
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:58,960
we

1818
01:08:58,079 --> 01:09:00,960
you know

1819
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:03,198
depending on the client depending on the

1820
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:04,719
project and the location

1821
01:09:03,198 --> 01:09:07,639
we might have

1822
01:09:04,719 --> 01:09:11,279
you know air conditioning as well as

1823
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:13,520
dehumidification and humidification to

1824
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:16,159
to always be able to very precisely

1825
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:17,040
control the cure room

1826
01:09:16,158 --> 01:09:21,039
uh

1827
01:09:17,039 --> 01:09:23,838
so that we don't we don't dry or or wet

1828
01:09:21,039 --> 01:09:25,439
the final product

1829
01:09:23,838 --> 01:09:27,439
does that help

1830
01:09:25,439 --> 01:09:28,879
yeah yeah the one question i have to all

1831
01:09:27,439 --> 01:09:30,479
this is you know you gave some targets

1832
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:32,319
like removing 40

1833
01:09:30,479 --> 01:09:34,798
of the moisture

1834
01:09:32,319 --> 01:09:36,480
in the plant within the first 24 hours

1835
01:09:34,798 --> 01:09:37,838
and then you know tailoring down from

1836
01:09:36,479 --> 01:09:39,039
there

1837
01:09:37,838 --> 01:09:40,719
um

1838
01:09:39,039 --> 01:09:42,079
you know that's great for a commercial

1839
01:09:40,719 --> 01:09:46,239
facility or someone with a water

1840
01:09:42,079 --> 01:09:48,158
activity meter but what sort of like

1841
01:09:46,238 --> 01:09:49,919
you know i want to i wanna also speak to

1842
01:09:48,158 --> 01:09:52,798
like that homegrower or people that

1843
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:54,719
don't have the ability to dial in

1844
01:09:52,798 --> 01:09:57,198
their environmentals quite so much like

1845
01:09:54,719 --> 01:09:58,640
are there any pointers or targets that

1846
01:09:57,198 --> 01:10:00,479
you would recommend

1847
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:02,400
you know like you alluded to the idea

1848
01:10:00,479 --> 01:10:05,039
that you know baker's racks are not as

1849
01:10:02,399 --> 01:10:07,519
good as you know bucking and dry hanging

1850
01:10:05,039 --> 01:10:09,920
the plant um right what other sort of

1851
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:12,000
things can we do that you consider to be

1852
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:13,760
you know more optimal or best practice

1853
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:15,920
in relation to drugs

1854
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:18,560
yeah i mean i think air movement is

1855
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:19,920
super key um which is why i don't like

1856
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:21,760
baker's racks because it's just hard to

1857
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:23,600
move air through there so

1858
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:26,320
just like in

1859
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:27,520
you know in a in the cultivation

1860
01:10:26,319 --> 01:10:30,479
facility

1861
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:32,960
if you have high humidity one way that

1862
01:10:30,479 --> 01:10:36,479
you one way you can mitigate that high

1863
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:38,399
humidity is by blowing air across your

1864
01:10:36,479 --> 01:10:41,919
plants to help break up that boundary

1865
01:10:38,399 --> 01:10:43,599
layer help you know the water move away

1866
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:46,480
from the plant that it's that it's

1867
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:48,480
transpired and and evaporated um rather

1868
01:10:46,479 --> 01:10:51,359
than just sort of hovering around the

1869
01:10:48,479 --> 01:10:53,439
plant same thing with the drying room is

1870
01:10:51,359 --> 01:10:56,079
even if you can't control to a specific

1871
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:59,919
temperature and humidity is if you're

1872
01:10:56,079 --> 01:11:02,640
moving air and not fast but just you

1873
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:05,600
know you feel the air moving

1874
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:07,920
through that room and across those

1875
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:09,120
branches and flowers

1876
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:11,039
then

1877
01:11:09,119 --> 01:11:12,960
you're probably going to be in good

1878
01:11:11,039 --> 01:11:15,279
shape and and we want that air to be

1879
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:17,439
filtered if possible and re-circulated

1880
01:11:15,279 --> 01:11:19,198
because we don't want to bring anything

1881
01:11:17,439 --> 01:11:21,359
in because

1882
01:11:19,198 --> 01:11:23,119
again we don't want to blow those spores

1883
01:11:21,359 --> 01:11:25,839
around

1884
01:11:23,119 --> 01:11:28,319
you know if if you can if you can target

1885
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:31,119
a temperature and humidity we want the

1886
01:11:28,319 --> 01:11:32,559
temperature to be less than 70 degrees i

1887
01:11:31,119 --> 01:11:34,719
don't think that the temperature needs

1888
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:36,800
to be less than 60 degrees we have some

1889
01:11:34,719 --> 01:11:38,880
growers who are really trying to

1890
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:41,760
chill their plants but

1891
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:44,560
if you can hit 65 or 70 degrees which

1892
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:47,840
most sort of residential or light

1893
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:49,199
commercial equipment can do

1894
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:51,440
then

1895
01:11:49,198 --> 01:11:54,559
you know the the relative humidity to

1896
01:11:51,439 --> 01:11:57,439
target again is less than 60

1897
01:11:54,560 --> 01:12:01,280
um you know somewhere between 50 and 60

1898
01:11:57,439 --> 01:12:03,119
percent would be ideal um again you know

1899
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:05,039
at that 60 percent you know i talked

1900
01:12:03,119 --> 01:12:06,479
about moisture content and water

1901
01:12:05,039 --> 01:12:08,800
activity

1902
01:12:06,479 --> 01:12:11,359
but the same is true for for relative

1903
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:12,800
humidity is that that is the moisture

1904
01:12:11,359 --> 01:12:15,359
you know

1905
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:18,480
relatively speaking pun intended that's

1906
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:21,279
the moisture content of the air and so

1907
01:12:18,479 --> 01:12:22,399
keeping the relative humidity below 60

1908
01:12:21,279 --> 01:12:24,000
is going to be

1909
01:12:22,399 --> 01:12:27,119
you know helpful

1910
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:28,719
um and you know the best way to do that

1911
01:12:27,119 --> 01:12:30,238
and and even in some of our commercial

1912
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:33,198
facilities we

1913
01:12:30,238 --> 01:12:36,079
we do do it still and i said do do we do

1914
01:12:33,198 --> 01:12:36,879
do it old school

1915
01:12:36,079 --> 01:12:38,319
with

1916
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:41,119
you know just

1917
01:12:38,319 --> 01:12:43,759
some mini splits and and dehumidifiers

1918
01:12:41,119 --> 01:12:46,079
and working together and that still

1919
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:48,320
seems to work pretty well

1920
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:51,920
for a lot of facilities so so air

1921
01:12:48,319 --> 01:12:54,238
movement a temperature between 65 and 70

1922
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:55,440
degrees and a relative humidity less

1923
01:12:54,238 --> 01:12:57,919
than 60

1924
01:12:55,439 --> 01:13:01,119
and you know if you can control those

1925
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:02,560
variables you'll be in good shape

1926
01:13:01,119 --> 01:13:05,359
awesome thank you for that i think

1927
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:07,520
that'll be helpful for people yeah

1928
01:13:05,359 --> 01:13:10,559
well we've been talking for a while now

1929
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:11,679
um i know you're busy uh i would love to

1930
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:13,440
follow up with you with some of these

1931
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:14,960
other questions on uh let's do it

1932
01:13:13,439 --> 01:13:17,839
another podcast yeah i'd love to talk

1933
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:19,920
about resource use efficiency in general

1934
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:20,800
dig in more about that water

1935
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:22,079
thing

1936
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:24,480
i know

1937
01:13:22,079 --> 01:13:26,000
at least here in california energy is on

1938
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:29,039
a lot of people's minds because of the

1939
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:31,760
new 2022 code

1940
01:13:29,039 --> 01:13:33,920
that was passed and so i know growers

1941
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:35,840
are worried about that and

1942
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:38,158
you know

1943
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:40,079
anyway i think there's a lot we we can

1944
01:13:38,158 --> 01:13:42,559
continue talking about so i'll look

1945
01:13:40,079 --> 01:13:44,238
forward to the next conversation

1946
