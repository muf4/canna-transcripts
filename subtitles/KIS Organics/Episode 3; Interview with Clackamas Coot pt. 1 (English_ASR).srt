see meg and lumper dogs on grass City he

13
00:00:38,558 --> 00:00:41,799
is an organic grower and gardener who

14
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:43,058
has helped many people and improving the

15
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:45,488
way they garden and move away from

16
00:00:43,058 --> 00:00:47,589
bottled nutrients he is most famous for

17
00:00:45,488 --> 00:00:49,959
his name crab and kelp soil mix which

18
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:52,090
many people know as the coop mix which

19
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:55,179
he shares freely and they sprouted seed

20
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:56,710
enzyme teas he makes using barley I met

21
00:00:55,179 --> 00:00:58,390
coot eight or nine years ago when he

22
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:00,549
came to one of my talks in Portland on

23
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:02,198
compost teas we became friends and I

24
00:01:00,549 --> 00:01:03,878
have to attribute a lot of credit to him

25
00:01:02,198 --> 00:01:05,858
in regards to our soil mixes and

26
00:01:03,878 --> 00:01:07,269
nutrient packs he's been a good friend

27
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:10,688
and mentor and helped me to improve my

28
00:01:07,269 --> 00:01:12,129
Gardens over the past decade well before

29
00:01:10,688 --> 00:01:14,498
we start I wanted to find out did you

30
00:01:12,129 --> 00:01:16,839
want to go by Jim or clack of a skill

31
00:01:14,498 --> 00:01:18,968
Jim yeah I don't care I mean more people

32
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:21,939
know me as good unfortunately so that

33
00:01:18,968 --> 00:01:25,328
was my fault though you're not hiding

34
00:01:21,938 --> 00:01:27,728
anymore your identity no I never was I

35
00:01:25,328 --> 00:01:29,708
just I got tired of Instagram and the

36
00:01:27,728 --> 00:01:32,259
silliness they're good I mean I thought

37
00:01:29,709 --> 00:01:35,740
forums were bad but they don't hold a

38
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:39,879
candle to social media I mean this is a

39
00:01:35,739 --> 00:01:43,629
whole you know sir I just you know I

40
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:45,548
yeah hey look I never made myself a big

41
00:01:43,629 --> 00:01:47,048
deal I all I ever did was pass out

42
00:01:45,549 --> 00:01:50,139
information about how people could make

43
00:01:47,049 --> 00:01:52,060
the soil better okay I mean I'm not

44
00:01:50,138 --> 00:01:54,368
selling anything they say everything's

45
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:57,039
in a bottle everything's proprietary I

46
00:01:54,368 --> 00:02:00,849
don't know just I'm disgusted with the

47
00:01:57,039 --> 00:02:03,998
whole thing so anyway I take it that

48
00:02:00,849 --> 00:02:06,819
obviously given your type of business

49
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:10,508
you know it's a tease and well Jim will

50
00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:13,628
have microbiology did you ever run a

51
00:02:10,508 --> 00:02:14,979
test on the the mammoth woman named

52
00:02:13,628 --> 00:02:17,229
mammoth micros

53
00:02:14,979 --> 00:02:19,000
here's what got me dead I did if after

54
00:02:17,229 --> 00:02:21,280
we're done check out our blog I that's

55
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,469
my latest blog post was I took it I

56
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,209
looked at it in the scope I added

57
00:02:23,469 --> 00:02:27,848
different ingredients as food sources

58
00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:29,170
cuz uh one of the claims that one of

59
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:31,419
their sales guys probably the guy you

60
00:02:29,169 --> 00:02:32,949
saw I don't remember the guys name but

61
00:02:31,419 --> 00:02:34,449
he said that the microbes are in a

62
00:02:32,949 --> 00:02:37,119
dormant state they they're not are their

63
00:02:34,449 --> 00:02:38,919
past their reproductive states which

64
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,930
wasn't something that I was even

65
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:43,389
familiar with I talked to Tim Wilson he

66
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:47,829
said that was a possibility but he

67
00:02:43,389 --> 00:02:50,109
doubted it anyway I talked to Collin

68
00:02:47,829 --> 00:02:52,030
Bell the founder real smart guy I liked

69
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:54,910
calling a lot actually at the same we

70
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:57,310
had a really good conversation and from

71
00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:59,019
talking to him I asked him straight up

72
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:01,269
I'm like can I put this in the compost

73
00:02:59,019 --> 00:03:02,950
tea bar the aerobic microorganisms if I

74
00:03:01,269 --> 00:03:04,599
add a food source what will happen and

75
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:08,729
he said yeah you can probably reproduce

76
00:03:04,598 --> 00:03:11,199
them in a brew so I just tested out

77
00:03:08,729 --> 00:03:12,189
posted all the microscope video of it

78
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:14,858
and let people draw their own

79
00:03:12,189 --> 00:03:16,780
conclusions yeah I know so have you been

80
00:03:14,859 --> 00:03:18,879
out to any dispensaries since cannabis

81
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:20,379
was legalized in Oregon if you want good

82
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:22,268
weed you got to grow it yourself it's

83
00:03:20,379 --> 00:03:24,519
just like tomatoes you can't find a good

84
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:28,269
tomato candy in this country because

85
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:30,669
it's been decimated by hybrids these

86
00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:32,650
production numbers and they have the way

87
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:34,719
they have to pick it they pick them

88
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:36,579
green they run ethylene gas inside the

89
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:39,219
trailers and transit so that when they

90
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:41,109
arrive at the produce warehouses they

91
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:44,370
spend less time in the ripening rooms

92
00:03:41,109 --> 00:03:47,169
which are injected with ethylene gas

93
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:49,689
just like bananas but you they also do

94
00:03:47,169 --> 00:03:52,180
to avocados they bring the color on and

95
00:03:49,689 --> 00:03:54,370
once they get color dad that's it

96
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:56,919
you're done get them out to the store

97
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:58,629
because the consumer all they want to

98
00:03:56,919 --> 00:04:00,609
see is color they don't care what it

99
00:03:58,628 --> 00:04:01,388
tastes like they don't care about

100
00:04:00,609 --> 00:04:03,340
anything

101
00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:05,709
but if you want a good tomato you got to

102
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:07,450
grow your own right yeah we uh there you

103
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:08,950
go we grow our own every year every year

104
00:04:07,449 --> 00:04:12,149
I always plant at least three new

105
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:14,709
varieties exactly this year I have one

106
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:17,699
Japanese trifle a I've never grown it

107
00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:21,038
before it's a potato leaf shape uh-huh

108
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:23,408
cool okay it's the same thing and it's

109
00:04:21,038 --> 00:04:25,478
the same thing in cannabis it's okay

110
00:04:23,408 --> 00:04:28,870
it's the same thing in anything I've

111
00:04:25,478 --> 00:04:32,829
been baking bread now for 20 years I did

112
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:35,590
six months at the baking Institute of

113
00:04:32,829 --> 00:04:37,779
San Francisco was six months long and

114
00:04:35,589 --> 00:04:40,529
the last and then three weeks in France

115
00:04:37,779 --> 00:04:43,500
working as slave labor really in

116
00:04:40,529 --> 00:04:45,219
bakeries but what an opportunity right

117
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,410
and then my daughter

118
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:49,270
anyway real life stuff happened I wasn't

119
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:51,010
able because of my plans were to open a

120
00:04:49,269 --> 00:04:53,409
bakery over on the coast well it didn't

121
00:04:51,009 --> 00:04:56,139
happen but I still have the skills so I

122
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:57,850
do all my own baking and I prompt you

123
00:04:56,139 --> 00:04:59,319
and let you go to an artisan bakery and

124
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:02,680
are willing to pay seven eight dollars

125
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:04,029
for a loaf of bread you're not gonna get

126
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,889
that quality that you can make in your

127
00:05:04,029 --> 00:05:07,269
home you want to talk about worm

128
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:08,529
castings that's what I'd like to talk

129
00:05:07,269 --> 00:05:10,569
about cuz that's what I really got going

130
00:05:08,529 --> 00:05:12,939
sure we can start off talking about worm

131
00:05:10,569 --> 00:05:15,909
castings I'd be great okay kick cuz Doug

132
00:05:12,939 --> 00:05:19,060
gave me a yard and I split it with coca

133
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:21,520
a yard of black leaf mold talk about

134
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:22,600
carbon you imagine what this is gonna be

135
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:25,839
like when it's finished

136
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:27,340
a hundred gallons of premium worm

137
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:30,219
castings which would probably last me

138
00:05:27,339 --> 00:05:32,759
two years you know I'm like the smallest

139
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:35,680
guy grower you've ever met believe me

140
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:38,259
all right well worm castings is my hot

141
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,009
button because I really I've been

142
00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:41,829
studying

143
00:05:39,009 --> 00:05:45,250
Edwards vermiculture book and other

144
00:05:41,829 --> 00:05:48,930
writings by Rhonda Sherman and Yasmin

145
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:52,029
Cardozo relative to not only the disease

146
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:56,590
suppression benefits but it was Yasmin

147
00:05:52,029 --> 00:05:59,349
Cardozo four years ago the insects

148
00:05:56,589 --> 00:06:02,229
oppression capable properties of quality

149
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:04,030
vermicompost all right let's go let's do

150
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:06,430
worm cut because I got some really

151
00:06:04,029 --> 00:06:09,489
exciting news relativity Niemann barley

152
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:10,600
in the bedding okay I'd love to cover a

153
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:12,220
little of those things and then the

154
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,560
other thing I've been arguing with

155
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:17,790
people about recently is I got I got

156
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:21,280
ripped up online for posting about how

157
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:22,660
composted forest products forest houmous

158
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:25,959
all of those things is just code for

159
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:28,060
sawdust well sure and that they're lower

160
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:31,389
quality ingredients guys jumped on me

161
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:34,300
saying no way Pete's unsustainable it's

162
00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:37,060
it's way worse oh these forest products

163
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:39,240
are great and like no they're not yeah

164
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:40,740
there's nothing wrong with leafmold ugh

165
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,629
but and then so they're like why not use

166
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:44,430
this isn't Li no that's holding they're

167
00:06:42,629 --> 00:06:46,829
like they're like use leafmold

168
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:48,379
use use for stuff and I'm like well

169
00:06:46,829 --> 00:06:51,240
those are not commercially available

170
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:53,399
sustainable options Pitts the best the

171
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,949
best we have you know and I'm not saying

172
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:57,799
it's perfect but they you know use hemp

173
00:06:55,949 --> 00:07:01,080
fiber well come on guys this isn't

174
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:02,939
commercially available you know like it

175
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:04,379
was killing me so I might want to ask

176
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:07,259
you about that a little bit too just to

177
00:07:04,379 --> 00:07:11,069
kind of you know sure because of the

178
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:14,370
arguments before we start the arguments

179
00:07:11,069 --> 00:07:18,210
are based on the political and economic

180
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:21,478
issues in the British Isles because to

181
00:07:18,209 --> 00:07:23,219
this day in the countryside the majority

182
00:07:21,478 --> 00:07:28,500
of homes are heated and they're cooking

183
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:32,370
eat is peat moss well the Brits want it

184
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:35,519
for gardening and the the Irish are

185
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:39,120
saying no we need this this is like you

186
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:40,948
want to take our oil okay so if you want

187
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,500
us not to use peat then you need to

188
00:07:40,949 --> 00:07:45,870
bring in the infrastructure and bring in

189
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:48,240
a natural gas or something into our

190
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:48,899
homes what do you want us to do here's

191
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,889
another one

192
00:07:48,899 --> 00:07:56,129
you are you a scotch drinker yeah ok so

193
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:57,360
you've heard the term smokey oh yeah ok

194
00:07:56,129 --> 00:08:01,228
well that comes from peat moss because

195
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:03,419
when they cook the malt or the yeah wort

196
00:08:01,228 --> 00:08:05,658
whatever it's called a you know a

197
00:08:03,418 --> 00:08:10,769
there's some really PD ones out there

198
00:08:05,658 --> 00:08:13,918
yeah right and so this is a so Scotland

199
00:08:10,769 --> 00:08:15,418
and Ireland basically tell the Brits to

200
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:17,609
go screw themselves so they bring these

201
00:08:15,418 --> 00:08:19,408
arguments that are legitimate in the

202
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:24,000
British Isles because it's politics

203
00:08:19,408 --> 00:08:25,800
right it's hubris and it's economics but

204
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,620
to bring that to the Canadian deal

205
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:33,360
that's tightly controlled by the CCS PM

206
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:35,578
and the industry there's a lot of

207
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:39,440
propaganda out there from the cocoa from

208
00:08:35,578 --> 00:08:42,149
the cocoa industry now you know it's

209
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,899
it's not even the same thing oh of

210
00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:45,809
course it is

211
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:48,480
hey they they screw themselves here in

212
00:08:45,809 --> 00:08:50,369
Oregon and California in the nursery

213
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,420
industry 20 years ago so where'd they

214
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:57,060
turn they turn to the weed

215
00:08:53,419 --> 00:09:00,059
but it was a disaster because it's not

216
00:08:57,059 --> 00:09:01,559
plant material yes it comes from a plant

217
00:09:00,059 --> 00:09:04,319
you'd be like the same thing as saying

218
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:08,159
well yeah these are dandelion petals

219
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:10,200
uh-huh cute how long that take you you

220
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:13,110
know to assimilate yeah it's a little

221
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,879
crazy so yeah it's an answer it's

222
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:17,340
tightly monitor with you know they have

223
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:21,419
adults in Canada running things and so

224
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:23,370
if their orders or son drove harvests

225
00:09:21,419 --> 00:09:26,759
more than all their competitors combined

226
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:32,549
the numbers from last year from CCS p.m.

227
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:34,830
that's a canadian louis bergna peat moss

228
00:09:32,549 --> 00:09:36,979
Oh CSP ma I'm sorry

229
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:40,740
Canadians pregnant peat moss association

230
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:43,080
okay son grow harvested you ready for

231
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:46,259
this one fifty four percent of all the

232
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:48,120
peat that was allowed to be harvested

233
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:49,649
but if some girl got big orders they

234
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:53,090
can't just go well hey we're gonna we're

235
00:09:49,649 --> 00:09:55,350
gonna pull another fifty truckloads ah

236
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:58,889
this the amount that you're allowed to

237
00:09:55,350 --> 00:10:01,350
harvest is set you're done like last

238
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:05,269
year when Alaska Pete ran out before the

239
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:08,250
buyout from there were innovations

240
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:11,639
because on the on the bales at three

241
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:15,179
point eight bales like you and I use or

242
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:19,559
have use whatever those are cut and

243
00:10:15,179 --> 00:10:21,439
wrapped at site they're not processed

244
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:23,519
now the stuff that is bagged

245
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,670
hey we'll talk about it because that

246
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,960
stuff is dried in a kiln if they call it

247
00:10:26,669 --> 00:10:32,039
sterilization so they killed the

248
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:34,889
microbes then you bring it down to big

249
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:38,429
plants like the one in Woodburn it's

250
00:10:34,889 --> 00:10:41,189
ground to a consistent size and now it's

251
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:42,929
hit with steam why well you've got to

252
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:44,370
get it wet again because when the

253
00:10:42,929 --> 00:10:46,589
customer was the bag they're gonna say

254
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:49,259
Oh God look how fresh this is no not

255
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:51,060
really but I mean so it's been

256
00:10:49,259 --> 00:10:52,139
sterilized in the oven an account you're

257
00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:53,609
talking about this stuff used for

258
00:10:52,139 --> 00:10:57,240
cloning are you talking about

259
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:59,490
smaller than a 3.8 Bale yeah the stuff

260
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,740
that goes in the bag stuff like sunshine

261
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:04,560
mix oh okay

262
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:06,440
I didn't I I've never gone smaller than

263
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:09,109
a three point eight cubic foot bail

264
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:11,030
oh yeah right so when you buy a bag of

265
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:13,060
any of those others notice they say peat

266
00:11:11,029 --> 00:11:17,720
moss on them well that's like sand

267
00:11:13,059 --> 00:11:20,889
flowers and what the kids call mids you

268
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:23,720
know the shake it ain't the good stuff

269
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:26,000
so what would the big one is a peat moss

270
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:29,509
is acidic uh-huh why don't you talk

271
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,610
about spagna peat moss oh well it's not

272
00:11:29,509 --> 00:11:33,730
a city right so don't use peat moss you

273
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:36,320
spec them peat moss I mean I don't know

274
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:38,000
it's not as acidic as I think people

275
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,090
claim but the nice thing about that

276
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,309
acidity is it allows us to add calcium

277
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:43,910
to get us back up to the levels that we

278
00:11:43,309 --> 00:11:46,250
want

279
00:11:43,909 --> 00:11:47,929
whereas with cocoa okay you're leaning

280
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:50,360
to talk about castings because castings

281
00:11:47,929 --> 00:11:51,109
are literally coated yeah I want to go

282
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,940
ahead and get started

283
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:55,490
you'd really want to talk about worm

284
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:58,250
castings initially here so why don't we

285
00:11:55,490 --> 00:12:03,620
dig right into that well I've been at

286
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:08,509
the request of my supplier I did a

287
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:12,019
little investigation on a teeny meal to

288
00:12:08,509 --> 00:12:16,960
the what people incorrectly called

289
00:12:12,019 --> 00:12:19,639
bedding and the numbers on both the

290
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:22,460
reproduction rates as well as the length

291
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:24,830
and girth the increases in length and

292
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:32,840
girth from the neem was quite remarkable

293
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:35,330
and then dug at northwest red worms he

294
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:39,440
grows or he produces his vermicompost

295
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:43,070
and worms in long wind rows and what he

296
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:48,350
does as a general rule is to pile up the

297
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:51,170
aged manure and then he dumps in produce

298
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:55,089
that he picks up from produce companies

299
00:12:51,169 --> 00:12:57,439
and what have you a number to stuff and

300
00:12:55,089 --> 00:13:01,670
then he set up another one and all he

301
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:03,740
added was malted barley and it wasn't at

302
00:13:01,669 --> 00:13:06,439
my request I just told them that this

303
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:09,649
what it did in the soil so he wanted to

304
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:13,040
see what effect it would have in as far

305
00:13:09,649 --> 00:13:16,309
as creating vermicompost and worms to

306
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:19,279
sell he said that he had never seen the

307
00:13:16,309 --> 00:13:20,268
reproduction rates of worms like he saw

308
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:25,549
in

309
00:13:20,269 --> 00:13:27,558
the pile with just the multi greens and

310
00:13:25,549 --> 00:13:29,058
it makes sense because what those grains

311
00:13:27,558 --> 00:13:32,600
are doing with you the enzyme is

312
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:34,308
deconstructing excuse me it's a catalyst

313
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:38,178
to deconstruct material making it more

314
00:13:34,308 --> 00:13:39,860
available to the microbes to break it

315
00:13:38,178 --> 00:13:42,308
down for the worms to ingest their

316
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:48,169
manure that's how castings are created

317
00:13:42,308 --> 00:13:50,419
so my point is if we he gave me a yard

318
00:13:48,169 --> 00:13:53,509
of black leaf mold three year old leaf

319
00:13:50,419 --> 00:13:58,549
mold and I split it with a friend so we

320
00:13:53,509 --> 00:14:00,558
each setup hundred gallon smart pots on

321
00:13:58,549 --> 00:14:03,318
a pallet for aeration through the bottom

322
00:14:00,558 --> 00:14:08,828
of course and then we added copious

323
00:14:03,318 --> 00:14:13,368
amounts of barley neem and Carranza and

324
00:14:08,828 --> 00:14:15,739
the other day I just barely lifted up

325
00:14:13,369 --> 00:14:19,730
the little top layer of the worm cat of

326
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:22,610
the bin and the worms were just masked

327
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:24,678
like it was crazy I couldn't believe it

328
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:27,470
and I did start out with I bought six

329
00:14:24,678 --> 00:14:29,688
pounds and 100 gallons I bought six

330
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:32,899
pounds of euros because they tend to

331
00:14:29,688 --> 00:14:36,438
stay lower in the material and do a

332
00:14:32,899 --> 00:14:38,480
better job of finishing and then when

333
00:14:36,438 --> 00:14:41,240
Doug loaded the stuff in the truck for

334
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:43,639
me he said by the way there's gonna be

335
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:45,379
quite a bit of red wigglers and cocoons

336
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:50,028
in this material so you're gonna have

337
00:14:45,379 --> 00:14:53,959
Reds wigglers work on the top and the

338
00:14:50,028 --> 00:14:56,419
euros work in the bottom of the bin

339
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:59,178
that's the European worms that's what

340
00:14:56,419 --> 00:15:01,818
you're for - yeah that's why Europeans

341
00:14:59,178 --> 00:15:04,068
do not make a good choice for vertical

342
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:08,778
flow through because they tend to stay

343
00:15:04,068 --> 00:15:10,789
lower in bedding or we want to call it

344
00:15:08,778 --> 00:15:12,860
the foods I call food stock because I'm

345
00:15:10,789 --> 00:15:16,338
talking about I don't use kitchen stuff

346
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:18,230
I mean I use either compost or good

347
00:15:16,339 --> 00:15:21,019
quality of manure my chiropractor has

348
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:23,928
draft horses you can imagine how much

349
00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:27,048
manure they produce every day and he has

350
00:15:23,928 --> 00:15:28,909
him in a field or that and he does give

351
00:15:27,048 --> 00:15:31,068
them vermis eyes which you have to but

352
00:15:28,909 --> 00:15:33,948
that's easy just age it for four to six

353
00:15:31,068 --> 00:15:35,778
weeks and the

354
00:15:33,948 --> 00:15:38,868
herma sides that were given to the

355
00:15:35,778 --> 00:15:42,350
animals deconstructs so they're no

356
00:15:38,869 --> 00:15:44,089
longer a problem so it's pretty exciting

357
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:46,609
pretty exciting because uh the reason I

358
00:15:44,089 --> 00:15:48,499
went with six pounds is I asked Doug if

359
00:15:46,609 --> 00:15:53,149
I want to have this finished by before

360
00:15:48,499 --> 00:15:54,709
the rain season starts so he mentally

361
00:15:53,149 --> 00:15:56,239
calculated I says I think that this will

362
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:59,198
take care of it with the amount of red

363
00:15:56,239 --> 00:16:01,970
wigglers that you have and cocoons

364
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:03,678
because what I saw the other day when I

365
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:06,199
lifted up the material obviously we were

366
00:16:03,678 --> 00:16:09,048
wigglers because the euros I went ahead

367
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:10,668
and just loaded him in the lower I kind

368
00:16:09,048 --> 00:16:14,778
of did like a lasagne did you know

369
00:16:10,668 --> 00:16:17,659
manure and kelp meal barley neem or

370
00:16:14,778 --> 00:16:22,308
karanji and then do another layer of

371
00:16:17,659 --> 00:16:23,928
manure or excuse me the elite mold so so

372
00:16:22,308 --> 00:16:27,048
it's kind of like sandwich so these were

373
00:16:23,928 --> 00:16:29,058
definitely the red wigglers and they

374
00:16:27,048 --> 00:16:32,448
were amassing like you would expect to

375
00:16:29,058 --> 00:16:35,480
see if you through and like say chopped

376
00:16:32,448 --> 00:16:36,818
up fresh peaches or something where

377
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:39,829
something has a lot of sugar

378
00:16:36,818 --> 00:16:41,479
yeah and so I'm pretty excited about

379
00:16:39,828 --> 00:16:44,508
what I'm gonna have when this is

380
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:48,129
finished because I figured that'll be

381
00:16:44,509 --> 00:16:51,789
enough for me for a couple years and so

382
00:16:48,129 --> 00:16:55,819
having the time and small amount of

383
00:16:51,789 --> 00:16:57,738
startup money I'm gonna have some pretty

384
00:16:55,818 --> 00:16:59,328
nice castings when it's over because the

385
00:16:57,739 --> 00:17:02,059
thing about cold compost and I learned

386
00:16:59,328 --> 00:17:04,088
this from your father one time we were

387
00:17:02,058 --> 00:17:06,588
talking about cold composting is that

388
00:17:04,088 --> 00:17:08,808
many if not most of the secondary

389
00:17:06,588 --> 00:17:10,849
metabolites in the plant material remain

390
00:17:08,808 --> 00:17:13,088
intact they're not lost like they are in

391
00:17:10,849 --> 00:17:13,088
thermal

392
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:19,610
thermophilic home composting so that's

393
00:17:16,308 --> 00:17:22,538
exciting they have those properties from

394
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:28,038
the name in the carranza with regard to

395
00:17:22,538 --> 00:17:29,690
insects and disease suppression so

396
00:17:28,038 --> 00:17:32,720
that's that's it and also then you can

397
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:34,220
add other materials like I don't know

398
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,409
how you've been down there up there

399
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:38,778
because you probably you've had we all

400
00:17:36,409 --> 00:17:40,610
had a lot of rain this year but I

401
00:17:38,778 --> 00:17:42,200
already did my first cutting on comfrey

402
00:17:40,609 --> 00:17:44,628
which is usually I don't get a cutting

403
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:47,420
till the middle of June and the ones I

404
00:17:44,628 --> 00:17:49,459
cut they're already back over

405
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:51,950
fifteen inches tall it's a shame you

406
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:53,990
can't cross comfort with every food

407
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:56,450
plant in the world because you can world

408
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:58,759
hunger yeah we're in the same page up

409
00:17:56,450 --> 00:18:00,680
here we we've already done our first

410
00:17:58,759 --> 00:18:03,619
cutting and we're well on our way

411
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:06,289
towards our second cutting already crazy

412
00:18:03,619 --> 00:18:08,389
isn't it it is you know talk about free

413
00:18:06,289 --> 00:18:12,799
fertilizer I don't like using that word

414
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:14,660
with excuse me newts you can't do any

415
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:17,930
better than kelp and come pre and

416
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:19,190
alfalfa those three and some either by

417
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:21,230
themselves or in some combination

418
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:24,470
there's nothing but good things I make

419
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:27,549
for our soils now I do want to caution

420
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:30,470
listeners in regards to comfrey because

421
00:18:27,549 --> 00:18:32,480
two things one it's important that you

422
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:34,579
use a sterile variety I think it's the

423
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,960
Bocking 14 it's the one that is most

424
00:18:34,579 --> 00:18:38,869
popular I think that's the one we have

425
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:41,329
on our property right but in addition to

426
00:18:38,869 --> 00:18:42,829
that wherever you plant that comfort

427
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:45,769
you're making a lifetime commitment to

428
00:18:42,829 --> 00:18:48,589
having a plant there that's right art it

429
00:18:45,769 --> 00:18:51,500
owns that piece of rules our staff made

430
00:18:48,589 --> 00:18:53,149
some poor choices that I wasn't aware of

431
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,890
at the time with a couple plantings of

432
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:56,720
comfrey and now we have it inside our

433
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:59,780
garden whereas before we were just using

434
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:02,240
it it's a great weed barrier a border

435
00:18:59,779 --> 00:19:04,700
for poorer quality soils as a way of

436
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,680
keeping seeds out of the garden right

437
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:08,630
and it worked great for that but when we

438
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:10,519
got a few into the middle of the garden

439
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:12,740
that had been planted there or you know

440
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:14,359
poorly weeded we're having a heck of a

441
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:17,059
time getting it removed it that in

442
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:20,359
horsetail oh man are not horsetail I

443
00:19:17,059 --> 00:19:22,669
apologize horseradish I planted some

444
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:23,329
horseradish and oh my gosh I can't get

445
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:27,279
rid of that either

446
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:29,689
oh really can I explain the Bocking no

447
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:30,920
nomenclature yeah please do and explain

448
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:33,019
a little bit more about comfrey let's

449
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,070
just talk about that really quick sure

450
00:19:33,019 --> 00:19:38,299
okay

451
00:19:34,069 --> 00:19:41,240
back in at the end of the 18th century

452
00:19:38,299 --> 00:19:44,869
in 1790 where the first seeds that were

453
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:46,309
sold in Great Britain not that the plant

454
00:19:44,869 --> 00:19:50,059
hadn't been around the plants one of the

455
00:19:46,309 --> 00:19:54,259
ancient ones out of the Greek era 500

456
00:19:50,059 --> 00:19:56,149
before the Common Era thing but so they

457
00:19:54,259 --> 00:20:00,559
were selling seeds because it was an

458
00:19:56,150 --> 00:20:01,440
incredible livestock feed but it's

459
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:04,109
extremely and

460
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,910
and but the thing about fertilizer

461
00:20:04,109 --> 00:20:09,869
didn't really happen until closer to

462
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:12,650
like the 1870s but in the 1930s a

463
00:20:09,869 --> 00:20:15,839
nursery man in Essex England whose

464
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:18,930
nursery was on Bocking Road named

465
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:21,990
Lawrence Hills whose book comfrey past

466
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:24,840
present and future was a is a summation

467
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:27,569
of his research and one of the research

468
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:30,059
stations was here in Canby Oregon just a

469
00:20:27,569 --> 00:20:33,299
few miles south of Portland and those

470
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:35,399
documents are still in the library you

471
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:37,769
can't check them out but you can go into

472
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:40,230
their reading rooms and review them so

473
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:44,839
originally they were close to 20

474
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:46,950
different Bocking one through Bocking 20

475
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:48,569
I'd have to check the book cuz I don't

476
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:50,880
like bad information I don't remember

477
00:20:48,569 --> 00:20:55,409
exactly why the blocking 14 is the one

478
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:57,720
that survived or became the one so

479
00:20:55,410 --> 00:21:01,350
basically everybody that grows blocking

480
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:05,700
14 is growing root cuts from a plant

481
00:21:01,349 --> 00:21:08,849
that was established about 1945 and for

482
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:10,230
those who pay homage to the genetic

483
00:21:08,849 --> 00:21:13,709
drift that might be something to

484
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:15,150
consider but in any event so that that

485
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:18,480
cutting has been passed around now for

486
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:19,380
over 72 years I think it's pretty

487
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:23,160
remarkable

488
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:25,110
and yes the sterols are great but like

489
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:27,660
you said that posted a piece of real

490
00:21:25,109 --> 00:21:30,000
estate you plant it they own it the

491
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:32,519
price and Portland area right now starts

492
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,549
at $300 to remove a comfy place

493
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:39,450
because remember they put down roots

494
00:21:34,549 --> 00:21:41,579
twice as deep as a fruit tree and people

495
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:43,559
that do silly things like take a roto

496
00:21:41,579 --> 00:21:47,129
tiller to it find the next year they

497
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:48,779
have you know hundreds of sterile plants

498
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:50,310
because it doesn't take much to start a

499
00:21:48,779 --> 00:21:52,349
new plant just a little bit of root

500
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:55,710
material as you probably because I know

501
00:21:52,349 --> 00:21:57,359
you prepare them for your customers so

502
00:21:55,710 --> 00:22:01,230
you know it doesn't take much to in a

503
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:04,109
little container of the soil and you're

504
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:06,029
gonna have you know another plant

505
00:22:04,109 --> 00:22:07,799
yeah quarter inch half inch of a root

506
00:22:06,029 --> 00:22:11,190
can potentially start another plant it's

507
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:14,609
pretty amazing oh yeah absolutely

508
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:16,380
it is and by

509
00:22:14,609 --> 00:22:19,109
first year everybody or let's say you

510
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:21,620
planted it now a new one they got the

511
00:22:19,109 --> 00:22:24,178
city when your customers came into your

512
00:22:21,619 --> 00:22:25,919
nursery and bought one you're not gonna

513
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:27,420
get much this year but even by next year

514
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:33,150
you're already gonna start getting some

515
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:35,640
really nice amounts of a comfrey biomass

516
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:37,350
to work with yeah you know I used to

517
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:40,320
make the tea where you soak it till

518
00:22:37,349 --> 00:22:43,709
smells like manure that's this so silly

519
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:46,710
I just cut it down top dress it as green

520
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:48,480
mulch and you know yourself how fast it

521
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:51,720
disappears I mean this is so much

522
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:55,019
nitrate plus it's what 99% water so

523
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:57,600
pretty soon it just disappears yeah I do

524
00:22:55,019 --> 00:23:00,058
see powdery mildew on it in the fall so

525
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:01,829
I don't like to yeah go straight into my

526
00:23:00,058 --> 00:23:04,109
home Postpile rather than into my garden

527
00:23:01,829 --> 00:23:05,369
right the reason that I use comfrey I

528
00:23:04,109 --> 00:23:07,279
think is really important to let people

529
00:23:05,369 --> 00:23:10,259
know in terms of it being a dynamic

530
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:12,569
accumulator how it pulls nutrients up

531
00:23:10,259 --> 00:23:14,640
from the subsoil and minerals that are

532
00:23:12,569 --> 00:23:16,139
not normally accessible to your other

533
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,900
plants that are not putting roots quite

534
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:21,059
so deep and then produces a ton of

535
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:23,070
biomass that leaf matter that we get out

536
00:23:21,058 --> 00:23:26,099
of it is really yeah that that's

537
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:28,710
essentially free nutrients well that's

538
00:23:26,099 --> 00:23:31,909
the same thing that alfalfa especially

539
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:34,919
here in the northwest because it's grown

540
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:37,320
primarily east of the Cascades

541
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:39,179
well those soils are somewhat richest

542
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:43,439
volcanic soils in the world literally

543
00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:45,990
and alfalfa because you don't plant it

544
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:49,169
every year you go broke your price Tau

545
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:52,349
Alpha seeds so by the time you're into

546
00:23:49,169 --> 00:23:55,799
your fourth or fifth year you're deeper

547
00:23:52,349 --> 00:23:58,949
than 30 feet so it to which is twice as

548
00:23:55,798 --> 00:24:02,389
deep as the almost twice as deep is the

549
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:04,830
comfrey and then the defilement by a

550
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:07,320
nutrient accumulator that I'd like to

551
00:24:04,829 --> 00:24:11,399
mention is kelp here's a plant that

552
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:15,149
grows what is it it's like 200 250 feet

553
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:17,910
a year without a root system and what's

554
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:20,190
remarkable is that it accumulates 83

555
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:22,890
elements but it leaves the ones that

556
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:24,710
would in impact its growth and then also

557
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:28,470
our garden if we use it in that would be

558
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:31,200
salt it doesn't accumulate salt

559
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:35,460
so Kelly in my opinion kelp meal alfalfa

560
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:37,710
and comfrey are the some of the top bio

561
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:40,620
nutrient accumulators because in the

562
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:44,130
case of the land plants how deep their

563
00:24:40,619 --> 00:24:48,179
roots go and the kelp that we get comes

564
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:50,970
out of the North Atlantic and they the

565
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:54,720
human race has been pulling that kelp

566
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:58,259
out of the ocean since 1372 to use as a

567
00:24:54,720 --> 00:25:00,000
fertilizer the in the early early days

568
00:24:58,259 --> 00:25:01,799
they used to burn it I don't know what

569
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,410
why you have to do that with wood to

570
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:09,389
release what is it the potassium yeah -

571
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:10,950
yeah yeah but it's not necessary with

572
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:14,340
the kelp and the advantage here the kelp

573
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:16,710
is all those elements all 83 are in the

574
00:25:14,339 --> 00:25:18,720
right balance it's not like the grocery

575
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:20,579
stuff well no this one's magnesium

576
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:23,700
hungry so you really want a high dose of

577
00:25:20,579 --> 00:25:25,199
magnesium no you don't that's that's the

578
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:27,029
best way to screw up your soil because

579
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,350
just like when you're a child and you

580
00:25:27,029 --> 00:25:30,509
got sick your mom might have given you

581
00:25:28,349 --> 00:25:32,969
milk of magnesia right because it

582
00:25:30,509 --> 00:25:34,589
tightens up your floor and your gut what

583
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:36,750
does the same thing in the Sun restricts

584
00:25:34,589 --> 00:25:39,240
the air flow and water flow and the soil

585
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:43,160
plus I know you don't get into this but

586
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:45,720
the whole you know imbalance turning the

587
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:49,259
cation exchange capacity on its head

588
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:51,140
with excess of magnesium but anyway the

589
00:25:49,259 --> 00:25:54,089
kelp and all these the other two

590
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:56,790
everything's in the right balance and I

591
00:25:54,089 --> 00:25:59,009
think they really add to if I were gonna

592
00:25:56,789 --> 00:26:01,889
make compost piles I would do compost my

593
00:25:59,009 --> 00:26:04,440
material first and then in the

594
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:06,330
mesophilic stage that's when I would add

595
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:09,660
those accumulators I wouldn't put it in

596
00:26:06,329 --> 00:26:11,819
at the start why burn them up right so

597
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:14,550
when it drops down below a hundred and

598
00:26:11,819 --> 00:26:16,649
you're starting your hopefully your

599
00:26:14,549 --> 00:26:19,200
several month cure of your compost and

600
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:21,269
you can add those materials and again

601
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,970
just like your dad and I talked about

602
00:26:21,269 --> 00:26:25,859
cold composting those compounds are

603
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:31,049
going to remain intact you know we just

604
00:26:25,859 --> 00:26:32,909
had the worm castings from dug tested

605
00:26:31,049 --> 00:26:35,220
and he does I do mine the same way he

606
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:38,700
does but I was telling the other day I

607
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:40,289
mean it came in at 6.8 pH you're not

608
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:42,090
gonna get any better than that and

609
00:26:40,289 --> 00:26:44,220
that's without any

610
00:26:42,089 --> 00:26:47,038
amendments or that's just the raw

611
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:48,269
castings and a lot of something that a

612
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:51,390
lot of people don't quite understand

613
00:26:48,269 --> 00:26:52,230
about castings is that inside the worms

614
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:55,710
gut

615
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:59,220
not yet but digestive tract you don't

616
00:26:55,710 --> 00:27:01,980
have a stomach the work the material the

617
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:04,860
castings are covered with a calcium

618
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:06,480
carbonate slime you know I mean you

619
00:27:04,859 --> 00:27:09,418
can't have problems if you're using

620
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,919
quality castings in that regard I mean

621
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:13,080
you can do some other silly stuff but

622
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:15,929
one thing that I think is a little

623
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:18,538
unique is you invest a lot of time a lot

624
00:27:15,929 --> 00:27:21,778
of money in creating high quality

625
00:27:18,538 --> 00:27:23,609
castings correct as part of your own

626
00:27:21,778 --> 00:27:25,558
personal soil when you make up your

627
00:27:23,609 --> 00:27:28,069
recipe word can you explain a little bit

628
00:27:25,558 --> 00:27:31,259
more about why this is so important as a

629
00:27:28,069 --> 00:27:34,019
fraction of your total media oh it's

630
00:27:31,259 --> 00:27:35,640
obviously too much I mean I take that

631
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:37,769
hit all the time and I just shrug my

632
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:40,200
shoulders and say yeah okay whatever it

633
00:27:37,769 --> 00:27:43,200
is true you don't need okay my mix is

634
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:46,580
the one that we all talked about years

635
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:50,819
ago we all met at I see Meg you know a

636
00:27:46,579 --> 00:27:53,038
third of Spagna peat moss and I don't

637
00:27:50,819 --> 00:27:56,668
want to get into this discussion but I

638
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:58,798
happen to prefer humus or lava rock

639
00:27:56,669 --> 00:28:00,659
which is scoria because I can buy it at

640
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:03,058
the landscape yards for nothing I just

641
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:04,169
have a real I don't like perlite because

642
00:28:03,058 --> 00:28:06,178
when I owned a nursery

643
00:28:04,169 --> 00:28:07,559
we grew plants that have to be in the

644
00:28:06,179 --> 00:28:11,309
field for several years

645
00:28:07,558 --> 00:28:13,129
Japanese lace maples and perlite moves

646
00:28:11,308 --> 00:28:15,778
around floats to the top

647
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:17,730
pumice doesn't float stays where it's

648
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:19,798
supposed to be in the strata okay and

649
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:23,130
then sunny then a third castings is that

650
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:25,859
too much I don't know I mean for some

651
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:29,460
people if you don't have your own thing

652
00:28:25,859 --> 00:28:32,069
going maybe it is but it's poor quality

653
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:34,079
as you know we do a lot of gardening

654
00:28:32,069 --> 00:28:36,178
here in the northwest that's a good

655
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:39,058
thing that means there's a lot of

656
00:28:36,179 --> 00:28:41,340
different choices for compost which is

657
00:28:39,058 --> 00:28:43,408
as it's turned out isn't always such a

658
00:28:41,339 --> 00:28:45,538
good thing because let's be honest it's

659
00:28:43,409 --> 00:28:47,669
just a lot of products that aren't very

660
00:28:45,538 --> 00:28:49,769
good it's it's definitely a problem I

661
00:28:47,669 --> 00:28:51,870
mean we we use the Olie compost I think

662
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:55,048
I told you about it boy almost a decade

663
00:28:51,869 --> 00:28:55,859
ago and it's right it's a good product

664
00:28:55,048 --> 00:28:57,839
it's not per

665
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:59,699
fect they do use a little bit of

666
00:28:57,839 --> 00:29:01,339
post-consumer waste so occasionally we

667
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:03,330
find some plastic in there which I'm not

668
00:29:01,339 --> 00:29:05,548
terribly excited about but the thing

669
00:29:03,329 --> 00:29:07,259
that they do right versus all these

670
00:29:05,548 --> 00:29:09,480
other companies is what you talked about

671
00:29:07,259 --> 00:29:11,099
with that static composting pile that

672
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:13,289
material sits for two to three years

673
00:29:11,099 --> 00:29:15,029
right and that's just something that you

674
00:29:13,289 --> 00:29:17,700
don't see in any of these other

675
00:29:15,029 --> 00:29:19,619
commercial composting facilities and no

676
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:23,009
it's a huge huge difference that I can't

677
00:29:19,619 --> 00:29:26,428
emphasize enough absolutely the value of

678
00:29:23,009 --> 00:29:28,859
compost in my opinion is the key

679
00:29:26,429 --> 00:29:31,860
component is how long was it cured we

680
00:29:28,859 --> 00:29:33,449
proved that with our castings because

681
00:29:31,859 --> 00:29:36,119
the material we're starting with look at

682
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:37,860
the castings that I'm creating right now

683
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:39,779
at the black leaf mold which was really

684
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:42,479
a that's a big gift because you know

685
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:44,668
yourself that's a multi-year process to

686
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,710
create black leaf mold oh yeah that's

687
00:29:44,669 --> 00:29:48,540
that's what we made a lot of our compost

688
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:49,890
out of for years our fungal compost it's

689
00:29:48,539 --> 00:29:52,319
a wonderful mid starting material

690
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:55,380
exactly so I'm already starting off with

691
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:58,950
my material at 3 years old now I don't

692
00:29:55,380 --> 00:30:01,290
have the lab equipment that would be

693
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:04,169
necessary to test it on the other hand

694
00:30:01,289 --> 00:30:05,819
the chances of me buying lab equipment

695
00:30:04,169 --> 00:30:08,190
to grow plants is somewhere between nil

696
00:30:05,819 --> 00:30:10,048
and none I mean I don't care I mean if

697
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:12,419
it didn't work then you know I got it I

698
00:30:10,048 --> 00:30:14,429
got a ghost I've never had I've never

699
00:30:12,419 --> 00:30:16,770
had bad worm castings I'll just leave it

700
00:30:14,429 --> 00:30:19,590
at that even when I've had to start with

701
00:30:16,769 --> 00:30:22,259
one year like health reasons I couldn't

702
00:30:19,589 --> 00:30:24,149
make my own compost so don't laugh but I

703
00:30:22,259 --> 00:30:27,599
went and bought bagged compost at

704
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:29,370
Portland nursery ok and I knew going in

705
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:31,139
that it wasn't gonna be good but you

706
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:34,439
know the old expression about

707
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:36,559
value-added commodities right by the

708
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:40,470
time it ran through the worm

709
00:30:36,558 --> 00:30:42,808
vermiculture cycle it was good but I

710
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:45,808
made sure I added things like I'm a big

711
00:30:42,808 --> 00:30:47,879
kelp user I use in my raised beds

712
00:30:45,808 --> 00:30:49,168
because in fact the you were the one

713
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:52,679
that told me about the book

714
00:30:49,169 --> 00:30:53,940
so we're years ago dr. sands seaweed and

715
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:56,070
plant growth there's something like the

716
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:57,929
seaweed in plants or something it's

717
00:30:56,069 --> 00:31:01,950
seaweed in plant growth he was the one

718
00:30:57,929 --> 00:31:06,390
who put maxi crop on the map back in the

719
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:08,870
50s William Stafford was the founder of

720
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:12,350
maxi crop

721
00:31:08,869 --> 00:31:14,269
and they began using a process it was

722
00:31:12,349 --> 00:31:16,308
never intended as a retail product this

723
00:31:14,269 --> 00:31:18,589
was strictly an agricultural product

724
00:31:16,308 --> 00:31:21,049
something that could be mixed in the

725
00:31:18,589 --> 00:31:23,000
water and applied to large fields and

726
00:31:21,049 --> 00:31:26,119
orchards and what-have-you so they were

727
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,980
using a sodium hydroxide and then I

728
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:30,769
don't know probably in the 70s maybe

729
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:33,620
maybe as the eighties you started seeing

730
00:31:30,769 --> 00:31:36,369
maxi crock show up at retail nurseries

731
00:31:33,619 --> 00:31:39,729
in a liquid form well they bring it into

732
00:31:36,369 --> 00:31:43,219
their factories south of Chicago on the

733
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:45,319
Illinois air anyway so they mix it with

734
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:46,460
water there and bottled it because

735
00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:49,879
you're not gonna ship bottles of

736
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:51,769
fertilizer from Norway to Portland

737
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:54,230
Oregon and have it make any sense as far

738
00:31:51,769 --> 00:31:57,019
as you know price so you got to bring it

739
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:59,569
in as a powder my objection to the

740
00:31:57,019 --> 00:32:02,660
powders is that everything is destroyed

741
00:31:59,569 --> 00:32:04,970
within terms of plant hormones

742
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:08,570
I mean secondary metabolites and the big

743
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:11,929
one is alginic acid now genic acid can

744
00:32:08,569 --> 00:32:16,549
hold 250 to 300 percent of its weight in

745
00:32:11,929 --> 00:32:17,720
water so for outdoor raised bed venues

746
00:32:16,549 --> 00:32:20,049
and that kind of thing

747
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:24,259
having kelp in there is a good way to

748
00:32:20,049 --> 00:32:25,759
maintain that the well that the wetness

749
00:32:24,259 --> 00:32:28,789
I can't think of the term right now I'm

750
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:31,220
sorry moisture retention content yeah so

751
00:32:28,789 --> 00:32:33,170
you know it helps that move a line it's

752
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:35,360
not a cure-all but it's part of and

753
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:39,950
that's what good compost does to it

754
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:41,659
retains water and slows down the then we

755
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:43,670
use our most we slow down the

756
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:45,679
evaporation because most water that we

757
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:48,019
apply to our Gardens it is lost through

758
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:49,460
evaporation you mean imagine look at the

759
00:32:48,019 --> 00:32:50,029
numbers sometimes it's kind of

760
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:53,630
staggering

761
00:32:50,029 --> 00:32:55,428
the percentage of five gallons of water

762
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:57,440
on a raised bed how much goes up in the

763
00:32:55,429 --> 00:32:59,509
air sure sure well one thing I want to

764
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,640
address is when people talk about your

765
00:32:59,509 --> 00:33:06,410
soil recipe it's probably the most

766
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:08,059
popular freely available soil recipe for

767
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:10,730
organic gardeners that wanted you living

768
00:33:08,058 --> 00:33:11,990
soil can i address that though yeah I

769
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:13,759
wanted to give you the opportunity a

770
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:15,679
little platform to talk about all right

771
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:17,779
because this is a joke and I've seen

772
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:22,090
I've said this many many written as

773
00:33:17,779 --> 00:33:24,849
postitive many many many times in 1937

774
00:33:22,089 --> 00:33:27,490
the Cornell University which as you know

775
00:33:24,849 --> 00:33:29,589
is one of the leading even then leading

776
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:31,240
horticulture research schools in the

777
00:33:29,589 --> 00:33:33,849
world not just the United States with

778
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:36,669
the world and a lot of things were

779
00:33:33,849 --> 00:33:38,699
established that day as an example or

780
00:33:36,669 --> 00:33:41,919
that week whatever it was a number one

781
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:44,590
nursery pot right isn't a gallon never

782
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:47,528
was a gallon and a number two isn't

783
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:49,209
necessarily exactly twice it depends on

784
00:33:47,528 --> 00:33:51,220
the manufacturer if you're in the

785
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:54,970
nursery business when you go to the

786
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:57,429
suppliers and you pick out the sheet or

787
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:58,750
the product they'll hand you a sheet and

788
00:33:57,429 --> 00:34:01,750
I'll tell you how many units you're

789
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:04,599
gonna get per yard of that size of

790
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:06,640
container but here it was a shovel full

791
00:34:04,599 --> 00:34:08,710
so they're trying to begin a process of

792
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:11,980
standardizing things sure yeah oh this

793
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:14,079
was this is before perlite that kind of

794
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:15,878
puts things in perspective for you all

795
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:18,639
people have to do is look up the Cornell

796
00:34:15,878 --> 00:34:22,509
mix that's all I did

797
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:25,899
and modified it a bit and I only use

798
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:28,750
three well I guess you'd say five okay I

799
00:34:25,898 --> 00:34:30,759
use copious amounts of basalt rock dust

800
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:32,168
and we're blessed here in the northwest

801
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:34,330
because we have some of the best of

802
00:34:32,168 --> 00:34:39,519
assault in the world it has to do with

803
00:34:34,329 --> 00:34:41,469
hardness I had you know I don't want to

804
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:43,750
introduced using multi grains in the

805
00:34:41,469 --> 00:34:46,299
soil but in terms of what most people

806
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:51,369
would call amendments it's limited to

807
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:53,169
three kelp neem and crab meal I've kind

808
00:34:51,369 --> 00:34:55,210
of backed off crab meal because that's a

809
00:34:53,168 --> 00:34:57,549
lot of money to get the chitin when I

810
00:34:55,210 --> 00:35:00,099
can get all the chitin I need and do

811
00:34:57,550 --> 00:35:03,789
from the malted grains barley in

812
00:35:00,099 --> 00:35:07,480
particular that's it so when people say

813
00:35:03,789 --> 00:35:09,279
well you know I did that you know the

814
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:12,190
potassium was just off the chart no you

815
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:14,109
didn't you didn't do mine you you went

816
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:16,630
and got something locally it may have

817
00:35:14,108 --> 00:35:18,940
been steered manure from Walmart for all

818
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:20,710
I know I have no idea what she is you

819
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:24,659
didn't make my mixes you don't have my

820
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:27,250
castings so say that you made a recipe

821
00:35:24,659 --> 00:35:29,588
but I changed things and now I don't

822
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:32,199
like it okay then don't do it I'm not

823
00:35:29,588 --> 00:35:33,969
making any money off this and I really

824
00:35:32,199 --> 00:35:35,169
don't care what they use in someone has

825
00:35:33,969 --> 00:35:38,078
to spend in order

826
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:42,099
time whining about something that is

827
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:43,690
just silly if you used dad biology in

828
00:35:42,099 --> 00:35:45,670
your soil you're gonna have a bad soil

829
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:48,280
that's all there is to it if you're

830
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:50,380
gonna use unfinished compost I don't

831
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:52,298
need to explain the science to you you

832
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:55,480
know what it does to the roots burns

833
00:35:52,298 --> 00:35:57,789
them so garbage in garbage out you want

834
00:35:55,480 --> 00:36:00,338
good potting soil you got to start with

835
00:35:57,789 --> 00:36:03,159
some good and you know you got to plan

836
00:36:00,338 --> 00:36:04,960
ahead maybe this year you got to get by

837
00:36:03,159 --> 00:36:06,670
doing this but you can start a worm bin

838
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:09,190
today all you gotta do is go buy a smart

839
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:11,260
pot load it up with some aged manure and

840
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:13,920
put in some aeration material because

841
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:16,510
you know this is an aerobic process

842
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:19,030
permaculture and then buy all the worms

843
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:20,950
you can afford or cocoons it's not

844
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:22,420
complicated or you can get the cocoons I

845
00:36:20,949 --> 00:36:25,210
found that some more affordable way all

846
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:28,500
right yes right cocoons that's a another

847
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:31,389
way online there's a gentleman down in

848
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:34,510
Georgia I don't know something like that

849
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:37,328
and he's like the Guru of cocoons I mean

850
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:39,940
he sells them to the commercial but yeah

851
00:36:37,329 --> 00:36:42,970
I mean figure each cocoon the average is

852
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:45,730
what 3.8 worms per cocoon I mean think

853
00:36:42,969 --> 00:36:48,719
about this so once that cocoon hatches

854
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:51,818
are the the hatchlings leave the cocoon

855
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:55,689
within 42 days they're sexually mature

856
00:36:51,818 --> 00:36:57,880
they then will produce three cocoons a

857
00:36:55,690 --> 00:37:03,309
week so that means that every worm is

858
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:06,730
going to produce at least on average ten

859
00:37:03,309 --> 00:37:09,250
new worms this is red wigglers others

860
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:12,639
have different reproduction rates so

861
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:16,239
think about that for a minute and the

862
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:18,909
numbers put in dr. Edwards vermiculture

863
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:20,739
technology book if you had perfect

864
00:37:18,909 --> 00:37:23,500
conditions and we never will but let's

865
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:25,479
say that we could set this up a pound of

866
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:27,190
worms today would be a thousand pounds a

867
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:28,838
year from today I mean that's pretty

868
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:30,789
amazing yeah I think the name of the

869
00:37:28,838 --> 00:37:32,619
company that you turned me on to was

870
00:37:30,789 --> 00:37:32,798
Blue Ridge permaculture is that ring a

871
00:37:32,619 --> 00:37:36,670
bell

872
00:37:32,798 --> 00:37:39,250
right yeah yeah I think he he was in

873
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:41,619
North Carolina and also had a something

874
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:44,318
set up in the Bay Area Oakland anyway

875
00:37:41,619 --> 00:37:45,640
yeah that Blue Ridge yeah yeah so I

876
00:37:44,318 --> 00:37:47,159
think the important thing what

877
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:49,009
essentially what you're saying is that

878
00:37:47,159 --> 00:37:51,409
in order for people that

879
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:53,330
surely evaluate the quality of your your

880
00:37:51,409 --> 00:37:54,739
recipe they would actually have two use

881
00:37:53,329 --> 00:37:57,529
your worm castings and we've already

882
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:59,089
talked a little bit of how much time and

883
00:37:57,530 --> 00:38:01,070
energy you put into creating those worm

884
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:04,370
casting and what an important aspect of

885
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:07,190
your total soil that really is then I

886
00:38:04,369 --> 00:38:09,469
don't have to have a new program I don't

887
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:12,079
have to be you know with a dog collar

888
00:38:09,469 --> 00:38:13,669
and a choke chain you know tied to I

889
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:16,329
don't name names because there might be

890
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:19,789
an advertiser or something but it's just

891
00:38:16,329 --> 00:38:22,219
the whole thing is silly to me I've been

892
00:38:19,789 --> 00:38:24,590
to a couple of these weed things you

893
00:38:22,219 --> 00:38:25,819
know events and they have these you know

894
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:28,340
these companies have these beautiful

895
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:30,500
displays and they put people in there

896
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:32,690
who they could either be selling

897
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:38,389
insurance door-to-door and Saturday

898
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:40,940
morning or used car salesmen I mean look

899
00:38:38,389 --> 00:38:42,440
ammonium nitrates ammonium nitrate I

900
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:45,200
mean go take it you know go take a

901
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:47,659
chemistry 101 at the Community College

902
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:48,980
down the street just you're buying and

903
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:51,409
people are buying stuff because of the

904
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:53,809
label and then the big one that gets me

905
00:38:51,409 --> 00:38:56,480
is what's proprietary well then you're

906
00:38:53,809 --> 00:38:58,250
an idiot for buying that stuff you're

907
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,110
believing that there's some mythology

908
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:03,800
that there's something special that has

909
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:05,960
to go into this noot product so you can

910
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:08,900
grow whatever it is you want to grow I

911
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:11,210
mean can you imagine the tomato industry

912
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:13,550
doing that the first guy that shows up

913
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:14,960
sales rep at California tomato

914
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:16,940
Commission Austin hey we're all gonna

915
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:19,369
switch over this cuz look at this cool

916
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:21,619
label that's a hot button with I just

917
00:39:19,369 --> 00:39:23,779
know I know and I think the reason we

918
00:39:21,619 --> 00:39:25,849
see these nutrient programs in general

919
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:28,430
being so successful is because either a

920
00:39:25,849 --> 00:39:31,549
people are starting with a poor quality

921
00:39:28,429 --> 00:39:33,619
media or what I see a lot of is people

922
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:35,890
are trying to grow like they would

923
00:39:33,619 --> 00:39:39,769
hydroponically with organic soil Oh

924
00:39:35,889 --> 00:39:41,989
exactly so you have giant plant tiny pot

925
00:39:39,769 --> 00:39:44,210
you can't get a five-foot plant in a

926
00:39:41,989 --> 00:39:46,819
three gallon pot it just doesn't work no

927
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:49,519
no yeah I mean there has to be that's

928
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:53,990
one of the reasons that I think you were

929
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:56,090
there at that point when one day a I

930
00:39:53,989 --> 00:40:00,739
wouldn't call it a study but it was a

931
00:39:56,090 --> 00:40:02,480
field test conducted in Aurora Oregon at

932
00:40:00,739 --> 00:40:04,609
the research station for

933
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:07,010
I think it's OSU is the one that runs it

934
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:09,530
anyway at that time it is a group

935
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:13,010
they're called Auto pruning pots and

936
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:16,400
smart pot is a brand and then you know I

937
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:17,510
don't now there's GOP juice but they did

938
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,550
a test on the ones that were

939
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:21,860
commercially for commercial growers

940
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:25,370
airpot remember that one caledonia tree

941
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:28,250
company dumbest idea for cannabis ever

942
00:40:25,369 --> 00:40:30,049
I mean dumb it's a difference between

943
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:34,280
growing saplings and I speak from

944
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:35,990
experience then growing a annual just a

945
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:39,550
whole different dynamic gears you notice

946
00:40:35,989 --> 00:40:42,589
how small the diameter is on those

947
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:44,450
they're tall cylinders they're narrow

948
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:46,190
some of theirs yes right one of the

949
00:40:44,449 --> 00:40:48,019
biggest losses in the nursery industry

950
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:51,019
is what's called knock overs and that

951
00:40:48,019 --> 00:40:53,059
comes from wind and storms right so the

952
00:40:51,019 --> 00:40:53,809
last thing you want is something that's

953
00:40:53,059 --> 00:40:56,029
top-heavy

954
00:40:53,809 --> 00:40:57,679
I mean it's challenging enough that's

955
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:59,360
why the smart pot which their parent

956
00:40:57,679 --> 00:41:02,779
company before there was smart pot it

957
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:04,849
was called the tree bag company and then

958
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:06,560
it morphed into high caliber but those

959
00:41:04,849 --> 00:41:08,509
are still manufactured with a sapling

960
00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:11,659
drawers and if you're interested you can

961
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:13,820
go to those separate websites not smart

962
00:41:11,659 --> 00:41:18,769
pot but it's a part it's part of the

963
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:20,630
same group and but as a group the auto

964
00:41:18,769 --> 00:41:23,630
pruning pots do allow you to get more

965
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:25,910
biomass then they say you had a

966
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:26,800
five-gallon standard where they call the

967
00:41:25,909 --> 00:41:29,569
black lipped

968
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,800
nursery pot so when we all that's ones

969
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:32,269
you get when you go to Home Depot and

970
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:35,150
buy a plant it's gonna be on one of

971
00:41:32,269 --> 00:41:38,869
those or if you use the number five

972
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:41,389
which in okay smart pot yes you can get

973
00:41:38,869 --> 00:41:44,869
more biomass but you're not gonna get

974
00:41:41,389 --> 00:41:46,759
double you know I mean you have to set

975
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:49,059
up your garden that makes sense to you

976
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:51,770
and then live within those restrictions

977
00:41:49,059 --> 00:41:54,650
because trying to push something cuz

978
00:41:51,769 --> 00:41:56,570
Johnny at grass City or icy mag or

979
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:58,070
whatever it is oh yeah just you know

980
00:41:56,570 --> 00:42:00,440
fill in the blank and then you know

981
00:41:58,070 --> 00:42:03,860
you've got these silly concoctions that

982
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:07,760
make zero sense for me if I had a poor

983
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:11,090
soil my focus would be what it is now

984
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:13,970
kelp alfalfa and means and if it's that

985
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:15,079
bad then do better next year you know

986
00:42:13,969 --> 00:42:16,579
make better choices

987
00:42:15,079 --> 00:42:18,710
that's my Reed

988
00:42:16,579 --> 00:42:19,849
I wanted to change directions a little

989
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:21,500
bit and talk a little bit more about

990
00:42:19,849 --> 00:42:24,110
barley that's sort of something that

991
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:24,800
you've really brought to the cannabis

992
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:27,980
industry

993
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:30,260
this idea of enzymes from barley and

994
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:32,150
enzyme teas and I know you started out

995
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:35,120
initially sprouting the barley after

996
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:36,889
attending a beer making class yeah you

997
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:38,599
talked a little bit more about where

998
00:42:36,889 --> 00:42:42,529
you're at now with it and your thoughts

999
00:42:38,599 --> 00:42:44,750
sure and why exactly I I had attended

1000
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:47,330
the San Francisco baking Institute in

1001
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:49,550
preparation to open up or accurately and

1002
00:42:47,329 --> 00:42:53,269
not so accurate called artists and

1003
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:55,039
bakeries and in what they call lean

1004
00:42:53,269 --> 00:42:58,420
dough's which means just the four

1005
00:42:55,039 --> 00:43:01,820
elements yeast salt flour and water

1006
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:04,639
baguettes and things they will also add

1007
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:07,490
what is called malt or diastatic malt

1008
00:43:04,639 --> 00:43:10,879
and so I would buy that from a bakery

1009
00:43:07,489 --> 00:43:14,079
supply house and never really understood

1010
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:16,460
or really cared much what diastatic men

1011
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:18,049
so one day out of sheer boredom I

1012
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:20,240
decided to look it up and then I

1013
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:22,789
realized well this is just barley malt

1014
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:25,489
and diastatic means that the enzymes

1015
00:43:22,789 --> 00:43:27,590
weren't killed like it is with barley

1016
00:43:25,489 --> 00:43:29,509
extract is not diastatic this non

1017
00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:31,100
diastatic doesn't mean doesn't have any

1018
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:35,210
value I mean the sugars are there and

1019
00:43:31,099 --> 00:43:37,099
some other things okay so then I was was

1020
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:40,150
Tim Wilson and I were talking back and

1021
00:43:37,099 --> 00:43:43,369
forth online and I asked him about yeast

1022
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:46,210
this used commercial yeast for bread

1023
00:43:43,369 --> 00:43:49,400
baking and which is a single-celled

1024
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:51,650
fungi so we add diced egg well to our

1025
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:54,950
bread to enhance the activity of the

1026
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:57,619
east so I'm thinking well what if we put

1027
00:43:54,949 --> 00:43:59,299
sprouted Barbic at this point I still

1028
00:43:57,619 --> 00:44:02,420
didn't understand that you could just go

1029
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:04,010
buy this stuff you know - Bruce store so

1030
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:07,309
I'd go over to Bob's Red Mill and get

1031
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:10,070
organic barley raw you know and then I'd

1032
00:44:07,309 --> 00:44:12,590
that's all multi means is just you let

1033
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:14,690
it sprout or germinate really you don't

1034
00:44:12,590 --> 00:44:16,640
really you don't grow it tapped it at

1035
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:20,059
all and then one day a friend who

1036
00:44:16,639 --> 00:44:22,339
fancies himself to be a beer master said

1037
00:44:20,059 --> 00:44:24,380
once you just go buy malted barley at

1038
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:28,640
the brew store you know they make this

1039
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:30,079
stuff yeah so I went bought it and the

1040
00:44:28,639 --> 00:44:32,449
rest is history I started

1041
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:33,799
adding it and then other people the

1042
00:44:32,449 --> 00:44:36,639
first thing that I saw

1043
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:39,710
besides the increase in resin set is

1044
00:44:36,639 --> 00:44:42,529
that we were cutting off several

1045
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:44,960
percentage points off the flowering

1046
00:44:42,530 --> 00:44:47,450
period one of the advantages that I have

1047
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:48,949
that probably a lot of people don't is

1048
00:44:47,449 --> 00:44:51,379
that I've been growing the same knot

1049
00:44:48,949 --> 00:44:54,649
strain the same plant two cuts mother

1050
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:57,410
cut mother cut for 33 years so that when

1051
00:44:54,650 --> 00:45:00,019
I test something I can immediately know

1052
00:44:57,409 --> 00:45:02,599
what is standard and if what changer is

1053
00:45:00,019 --> 00:45:04,159
good or bad right that's a huge benefit

1054
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:07,039
it's essentially your control your

1055
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:09,199
genetic control so right exactly because

1056
00:45:07,039 --> 00:45:11,630
so many people I see well yeah I'm gonna

1057
00:45:09,199 --> 00:45:15,889
try fill-in-the-blank whatever it is and

1058
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:18,320
this time I'm gonna use this seed or cut

1059
00:45:15,889 --> 00:45:22,279
okay well that's cool but it has nothing

1060
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:26,390
to do with research so immediately I saw

1061
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:28,790
that I was finishing 15% faster and then

1062
00:45:26,389 --> 00:45:30,940
other people who use different methods

1063
00:45:28,789 --> 00:45:32,809
of determining when it's finished

1064
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:34,280
started put and I never even

1065
00:45:32,809 --> 00:45:36,710
I never even discussed it because I

1066
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:39,019
wasn't sure but then there was just too

1067
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:41,960
many people posting that yeah I'm seeing

1068
00:45:39,019 --> 00:45:45,800
15-20 percent reduction

1069
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:49,220
but the main thing that I saw is the

1070
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:50,660
increase in the girth and what I would

1071
00:45:49,219 --> 00:45:54,009
call the tensile strength of the

1072
00:45:50,659 --> 00:45:57,259
branches I was having to use far less

1073
00:45:54,010 --> 00:45:59,600
support and the later stages of

1074
00:45:57,260 --> 00:46:02,450
flowering from the flowers being so

1075
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:05,139
heavy but but the resin set is off the

1076
00:46:02,449 --> 00:46:07,489
off the chart and some of the fellows

1077
00:46:05,139 --> 00:46:09,469
especially at Instagram that I couldn't

1078
00:46:07,489 --> 00:46:12,589
believe how much they were adding I mean

1079
00:46:09,469 --> 00:46:13,909
I'm really cautious as you know but some

1080
00:46:12,590 --> 00:46:16,070
of these guys are adding like you know

1081
00:46:13,909 --> 00:46:17,839
five pounds a week you know on two

1082
00:46:16,070 --> 00:46:20,360
hundred gallon pots the outdoor of the

1083
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:22,160
boys of summer and I just I said are you

1084
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:25,430
sure I mean that's kind of seems insane

1085
00:46:22,159 --> 00:46:27,920
amount but now that I've been adding it

1086
00:46:25,429 --> 00:46:32,089
to my warm bin I can't believe the

1087
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:35,840
amount of biology activity with not just

1088
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:37,880
the worms but the other organisms that

1089
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:40,750
we find in a healthy worm bin you know

1090
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:43,220
the shredders and the this and that

1091
00:46:40,750 --> 00:46:43,789
unfortunately because of what happens

1092
00:46:43,219 --> 00:46:46,279
when you

1093
00:46:43,789 --> 00:46:49,550
tried a bottle and I've approached a lot

1094
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:53,420
of Brewers first of all Brewers are only

1095
00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:56,780
care about one enzyme amylase that's it

1096
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:59,780
but in bar b we have yer a's protease

1097
00:46:56,780 --> 00:47:02,030
phosphatase there's a total of eight i

1098
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:03,350
posted so many times I can almost type

1099
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:05,690
it automatically I'll even reading it

1100
00:47:03,349 --> 00:47:08,299
because I I know from bread baking if

1101
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:10,190
you use too much malt or diastatic well

1102
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:12,289
as they call it that all of a sudden you

1103
00:47:10,190 --> 00:47:14,240
lose your structure and your structure

1104
00:47:12,289 --> 00:47:16,940
is what well it's gluten what's gluten

1105
00:47:14,239 --> 00:47:19,419
protein now I learned that it's the

1106
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:21,829
protease to high levels of protease

1107
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:24,230
weakens the structure of the gluten so

1108
00:47:21,829 --> 00:47:26,150
therefore you're not getting what

1109
00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:28,070
Baker's call the inside of the outside

1110
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:30,769
is called the crumb all right so the

1111
00:47:28,070 --> 00:47:32,450
inside is called the I'm sorry the

1112
00:47:30,769 --> 00:47:34,159
outside is called the crust and the

1113
00:47:32,449 --> 00:47:35,989
inside they refer to it as the crumb

1114
00:47:34,159 --> 00:47:38,899
Baker's we'll talk about well how is the

1115
00:47:35,989 --> 00:47:41,359
crumb on that flour as an example right

1116
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:45,019
so if you use too much diastatic malt

1117
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:47,240
the protease is accelerating the

1118
00:47:45,019 --> 00:47:48,739
breakdown of the gluten which provided

1119
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:52,189
the protein which provides the structure

1120
00:47:48,739 --> 00:47:54,169
to the period now in our soils that

1121
00:47:52,190 --> 00:47:57,679
wouldn't be an issue and what I can

1122
00:47:54,170 --> 00:48:00,050
attest is that not one person in my

1123
00:47:57,679 --> 00:48:03,940
circle and I don't read too much online

1124
00:48:00,050 --> 00:48:06,320
because people will mix it with you know

1125
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:08,389
ammonia cuz somebody told him to do it

1126
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:11,269
you know that malt didn't work it burned

1127
00:48:08,389 --> 00:48:14,949
my plants okay wasn't the ammonia right

1128
00:48:11,269 --> 00:48:17,900
just it was the barley but we're seeing

1129
00:48:14,949 --> 00:48:20,989
incredible acceleration like after you

1130
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:23,030
transplant you're rooted cuts and just

1131
00:48:20,989 --> 00:48:24,889
sprinkle maybe like a half a teaspoon of

1132
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:28,370
barley on top and just water it in that

1133
00:48:24,889 --> 00:48:30,379
alone will accelerate the root growth to

1134
00:48:28,369 --> 00:48:33,380
get them ready for transplanting faster

1135
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:34,700
depending on your system of rooting Jim

1136
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:37,070
can you expand a little bit more about

1137
00:48:34,699 --> 00:48:38,929
why these what enzymes do why they're

1138
00:48:37,070 --> 00:48:40,580
important what started what the barley

1139
00:48:38,929 --> 00:48:43,279
is doing or do you think is doing that's

1140
00:48:40,579 --> 00:48:45,650
making it so beneficial to soils in part

1141
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:49,730
of the amylase of course what's amylase

1142
00:48:45,650 --> 00:48:52,700
do that's your our saliva is uber levels

1143
00:48:49,730 --> 00:48:54,920
amylase it starts breaking down sugars

1144
00:48:52,699 --> 00:48:57,589
right carbohydrates into simple sugars

1145
00:48:54,920 --> 00:49:01,460
well that's what plants use and

1146
00:48:57,590 --> 00:49:04,730
protease proteins eurasia ria and then

1147
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:07,400
phosphatase which since that's a popular

1148
00:49:04,730 --> 00:49:09,829
discussion especially in cannabis boards

1149
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:11,780
you know phosphorus real or imagined

1150
00:49:09,829 --> 00:49:15,440
that one should really get him excited

1151
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:19,010
because these things if you the

1152
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:22,670
description used by biologists is that

1153
00:49:19,010 --> 00:49:25,430
enzymes are catalysts and so kite mates

1154
00:49:22,670 --> 00:49:26,990
for example kinase is important because

1155
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:30,069
chitin in and of itself doesn't really

1156
00:49:26,989 --> 00:49:31,609
do much in the soil chitin is a

1157
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:34,870
polysaccharide

1158
00:49:31,610 --> 00:49:38,800
it's an acetyl form of a glucosamine

1159
00:49:34,869 --> 00:49:41,869
it's what your you had surgery either

1160
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:43,940
external or oral surgery they'll slow

1161
00:49:41,869 --> 00:49:46,159
you up with chitin and here's another

1162
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:49,400
interesting connection to the albert

1163
00:49:46,159 --> 00:49:53,420
hofmann the man who isolated several

1164
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:57,530
compounds in Ald 52 and LSC 25 and later

1165
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:59,809
went when he was at santos labs well at

1166
00:49:57,530 --> 00:50:02,450
the age of 22 if you can imagine this he

1167
00:49:59,809 --> 00:50:06,110
graduates with a doctorate in chemistry

1168
00:50:02,449 --> 00:50:09,710
or biology doesn't matter he was the one

1169
00:50:06,110 --> 00:50:12,559
who figured out the molecular not

1170
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:16,010
formula but structure of chitin and it

1171
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:16,699
was a big deal in 1922 so he was like

1172
00:50:16,010 --> 00:50:21,560
this

1173
00:50:16,699 --> 00:50:23,809
his was I mean this genius so he really

1174
00:50:21,559 --> 00:50:26,949
understood the complexities of these and

1175
00:50:23,809 --> 00:50:31,940
that's what for example Althea it's

1176
00:50:26,949 --> 00:50:34,759
grown on rye ergo it's a mold and so in

1177
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:37,250
our soils they accelerate the chitin as

1178
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:40,700
the bacteria tried to deconstruct the

1179
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:42,619
this polysaccharide it creates chitin

1180
00:50:40,699 --> 00:50:44,629
ace and it's chitin is it gives us the

1181
00:50:42,619 --> 00:50:46,819
benefits that's what B constructs the

1182
00:50:44,630 --> 00:50:49,700
eggshells of insects as an example

1183
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:53,090
there's also topics that listeners might

1184
00:50:49,699 --> 00:50:56,059
be interested in the chitin a salicylic

1185
00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:58,490
acid pathway which is one of the several

1186
00:50:56,059 --> 00:51:00,920
pathways that plants have as a defense

1187
00:50:58,489 --> 00:51:02,899
system the SAR the systemic acquired

1188
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:06,710
resistance there's other there's

1189
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:10,039
ethylene cells like salicylic acid is a

1190
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:11,389
key component in several of the pathways

1191
00:51:10,039 --> 00:51:13,880
which is why I've also

1192
00:51:11,389 --> 00:51:18,170
been a big advocate of using quality

1193
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:21,559
aloe vera materials so when we add the

1194
00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:23,329
barley to and I really strongly if

1195
00:51:21,559 --> 00:51:26,210
people are going to do a worm bin please

1196
00:51:23,329 --> 00:51:28,940
add all the barley you can because it

1197
00:51:26,210 --> 00:51:33,798
will really accelerate the conversion of

1198
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:35,630
manure and uh vermicompost and that's

1199
00:51:33,798 --> 00:51:37,940
another reason that he's fulvic acid

1200
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:40,220
because dr. Fauci is he has an

1201
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:44,088
interesting description of phobic acid

1202
00:51:40,219 --> 00:51:47,868
so enzymes are catalysts and then he

1203
00:51:44,088 --> 00:51:52,369
wrote that fulvic acid pure folic acid

1204
00:51:47,869 --> 00:51:55,099
is a catalyst of catalyst and a reason

1205
00:51:52,369 --> 00:51:57,200
to do according to the directions

1206
00:51:55,099 --> 00:51:59,329
because his products are professional

1207
00:51:57,199 --> 00:52:01,219
not don't start high dosing if you want

1208
00:51:59,329 --> 00:52:04,309
to see Jurassic Park plants start high

1209
00:52:01,219 --> 00:52:05,088
dosing with fulvic acid and that's

1210
00:52:04,309 --> 00:52:08,839
something you're not gonna be able to

1211
00:52:05,088 --> 00:52:10,518
flush out either DS barley yeah we've

1212
00:52:08,838 --> 00:52:15,710
just we started using it in our nursery

1213
00:52:10,518 --> 00:52:17,689
in our we we do we do edible veggie

1214
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:21,769
starts and then we're just now planting

1215
00:52:17,690 --> 00:52:22,880
our Rose out and so I have sure well the

1216
00:52:21,768 --> 00:52:24,558
the stuff that I've been working with

1217
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:27,410
you on with the tinctures I've been

1218
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:29,690
using that in trials in different rows

1219
00:52:27,409 --> 00:52:31,159
comparing comparing plants alright I'm

1220
00:52:29,690 --> 00:52:33,710
hoping to share that with you get really

1221
00:52:31,159 --> 00:52:36,710
soon but I haven't done just the

1222
00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:38,000
straight barley now I just set up my

1223
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:41,389
vegetable garden cuz I'm not actually

1224
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:43,278
growing any cannabis no I just have my

1225
00:52:41,389 --> 00:52:47,088
vegetable garden most of my gardening is

1226
00:52:43,278 --> 00:52:49,159
a vegetable - yeah so I've started using

1227
00:52:47,088 --> 00:52:51,710
the my raised bed there and I'm gonna I

1228
00:52:49,159 --> 00:52:53,268
just planned my tomatoes last week so

1229
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:57,259
I'm excited to start trying out some of

1230
00:52:53,268 --> 00:52:59,268
these things here at home - I one thing

1231
00:52:57,259 --> 00:53:02,329
I'd like to tell your audience is that

1232
00:52:59,268 --> 00:53:04,429
when you go to a homebrew store it

1233
00:53:02,329 --> 00:53:07,430
doesn't matter what grain you get so if

1234
00:53:04,429 --> 00:53:11,179
they have rye on sale malted rice I

1235
00:53:07,429 --> 00:53:12,618
wanted right if they have oats which is

1236
00:53:11,179 --> 00:53:14,659
one of my favorite for no other reason

1237
00:53:12,619 --> 00:53:16,130
that just it's that to me it sounds cool

1238
00:53:14,659 --> 00:53:19,190
I keep thinking of the guy on the Quaker

1239
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:21,170
Oats box you know but anyway by price

1240
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:23,750
and sometimes they'll have distressed

1241
00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:24,858
merchandise maybe water damage to the

1242
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:27,230
sack or what

1243
00:53:24,858 --> 00:53:28,940
just go ahead and get it I mean okay

1244
00:53:27,230 --> 00:53:32,298
Stein Bart in Portland they're the

1245
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:34,849
oldest rooster in the United States they

1246
00:53:32,298 --> 00:53:37,400
started 98 years ago you wouldn't

1247
00:53:34,849 --> 00:53:38,809
believe the number of people when I

1248
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:41,420
started doing I said well yes nine

1249
00:53:38,809 --> 00:53:42,710
Bart's has everything they do they you

1250
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:44,930
go and then they probably have 10

1251
00:53:42,710 --> 00:53:48,409
different malted grains different like

1252
00:53:44,929 --> 00:53:52,699
different red wheat white we barley

1253
00:53:48,409 --> 00:53:54,259
spelt oats you know you get the idea

1254
00:53:52,699 --> 00:53:55,278
a lot of different seeds and they were

1255
00:53:54,259 --> 00:53:58,489
telling me that you wouldn't believe how

1256
00:53:55,278 --> 00:53:59,539
many people order from us I said they

1257
00:53:58,489 --> 00:54:03,380
don't whether they don't have Bruce

1258
00:53:59,539 --> 00:54:05,599
stores in Chicago I mean use some

1259
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:09,019
imagination you know I mean something

1260
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:11,630
and also I'd like to add I'm not saying

1261
00:54:09,018 --> 00:54:14,209
that you don't want to use it certainly

1262
00:54:11,630 --> 00:54:18,380
in compost it's a good thing but do not

1263
00:54:14,210 --> 00:54:20,358
use spent brewery grain the same way

1264
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:22,400
that you're going to use malted barley

1265
00:54:20,358 --> 00:54:26,630
they're two different the one has been

1266
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:29,059
trance trance changed through the

1267
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:30,950
fermentation process so it's not the

1268
00:54:29,059 --> 00:54:33,950
same thing and you can really get into

1269
00:54:30,949 --> 00:54:36,528
trouble so either go buy the real stuff

1270
00:54:33,949 --> 00:54:39,889
or do you know do something else is what

1271
00:54:36,528 --> 00:54:41,409
I'm saying I'm gonna run I'm not saying

1272
00:54:39,889 --> 00:54:44,150
that sprint greens aren't good they are

1273
00:54:41,409 --> 00:54:46,399
but it's not the same thing that's a

1274
00:54:44,150 --> 00:54:47,749
really good point and you you like to

1275
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:49,400
look let's talk a little bit more about

1276
00:54:47,748 --> 00:54:51,439
how you process it so when you go in

1277
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:54,048
there I know it f H time Bert's they

1278
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:56,210
have a grinder there that they they can

1279
00:54:54,048 --> 00:54:57,528
adjust or and you like that course or

1280
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:59,539
grounds right

1281
00:54:57,528 --> 00:55:02,210
multi-grain yeah I mean that's that's

1282
00:54:59,539 --> 00:55:05,028
really comes down to personal I mean if

1283
00:55:02,210 --> 00:55:08,179
I'm gonna mix soil yeah I mean larger

1284
00:55:05,028 --> 00:55:11,929
pieces are fine when I first started I

1285
00:55:08,179 --> 00:55:15,588
used grain mill that I bought from

1286
00:55:11,929 --> 00:55:17,058
Austria a coma and got it to the finest

1287
00:55:15,588 --> 00:55:20,179
powder that it could so that I could

1288
00:55:17,059 --> 00:55:23,390
sprinkle it on top the soil and then

1289
00:55:20,179 --> 00:55:25,219
water it in with a Chapin concrete

1290
00:55:23,389 --> 00:55:27,498
sprayer so really get a push down in

1291
00:55:25,219 --> 00:55:29,748
there so if I were gonna top dress I'd

1292
00:55:27,498 --> 00:55:32,618
probably want to use you want to use the

1293
00:55:29,748 --> 00:55:34,939
finest grain you can get but if you're

1294
00:55:32,619 --> 00:55:38,570
preparing soil or certainly for your

1295
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:40,820
compost material then you don't you

1296
00:55:38,570 --> 00:55:43,519
you get larger but they dread it's a

1297
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:45,050
free service and most larger from what I

1298
00:55:43,519 --> 00:55:46,309
understand I've traveled around the

1299
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:49,100
country looking at them but I understand

1300
00:55:46,309 --> 00:55:49,820
that most stores have grinders for their

1301
00:55:49,099 --> 00:55:52,250
customers

1302
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:54,590
to grind the the grains they buy for the

1303
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:56,210
the home brewing sector yeah they

1304
00:55:54,590 --> 00:55:58,190
usually charge a nominal fee they're not

1305
00:55:56,210 --> 00:55:59,780
able to adjust the grind sometimes you

1306
00:55:58,190 --> 00:56:00,769
get kind of get what you get but you

1307
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:03,170
know that's not the you know the

1308
00:56:00,769 --> 00:56:05,480
advantage of a finer grind like you

1309
00:56:03,170 --> 00:56:06,740
mentioned is greater surface area so

1310
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:09,740
that the microbes are gonna be able to

1311
00:56:06,739 --> 00:56:11,750
break it down faster correct and and

1312
00:56:09,739 --> 00:56:14,719
that was proven at a project that I was

1313
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:17,900
involved in and I told them to get it to

1314
00:56:14,719 --> 00:56:21,500
grind it or worst case scenario let me

1315
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:25,280
know and I would do a few pounds form in

1316
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:27,469
my coma grinder anyway they decided well

1317
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:30,410
no we're not gonna grind it at all and

1318
00:56:27,469 --> 00:56:32,809
they mixed it with the the whole malted

1319
00:56:30,409 --> 00:56:35,539
grain with worm castings and top dress

1320
00:56:32,809 --> 00:56:37,309
some plants in a public garden that were

1321
00:56:35,539 --> 00:56:40,039
under this dress now what was

1322
00:56:37,309 --> 00:56:41,719
interesting is that in spite of fact

1323
00:56:40,039 --> 00:56:44,599
they were when I went out to visit like

1324
00:56:41,719 --> 00:56:47,449
two weeks later the grains were still

1325
00:56:44,599 --> 00:56:51,940
intact for the most part but the amount

1326
00:56:47,449 --> 00:56:55,809
of evidence of fungal growth mycelia m--

1327
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:58,760
just exploded in the areas surrounding

1328
00:56:55,809 --> 00:57:01,250
the piece of green now that's kind of

1329
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:04,970
exciting news because that confirms what

1330
00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:07,760
I thought is that this was really a very

1331
00:57:04,969 --> 00:57:10,819
hi excuse me

1332
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:16,700
a very good food for fungal development

1333
00:57:10,820 --> 00:57:19,670
in our compost worm bins and in our

1334
00:57:16,699 --> 00:57:23,899
soils so I'll send you the photo that

1335
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:27,349
was taken at 20x and it's pretty

1336
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:29,599
spectacular I mean looks like some bad

1337
00:57:27,349 --> 00:57:30,710
cheese you know you got forgot about in

1338
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:33,319
the back of the refrigerator or

1339
00:57:30,710 --> 00:57:36,320
something and it's a red color and all

1340
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:39,230
that stuff one of the problems in trying

1341
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:44,960
to get information about malt is that I

1342
00:57:39,230 --> 00:57:49,490
talked to over 20 brew masters and even

1343
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:51,949
a couple the head people are founders of

1344
00:57:49,489 --> 00:57:53,250
artists and malting houses do you know

1345
00:57:51,949 --> 00:57:56,049
that now

1346
00:57:53,250 --> 00:57:58,869
had any idea that there was something

1347
00:57:56,050 --> 00:58:02,110
called chitin days and malt barley in

1348
00:57:58,869 --> 00:58:05,199
Altered grains or phosphatase or yer ace

1349
00:58:02,110 --> 00:58:08,440
or pro taste I mean I was blown away but

1350
00:58:05,199 --> 00:58:10,869
they can talk about emily's they got

1351
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:14,380
that one down because that's the one

1352
00:58:10,869 --> 00:58:16,779
that is central to the process of

1353
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:19,720
brewing beer and can i address one other

1354
00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:22,000
thing there's two types of barley it's a

1355
00:58:19,719 --> 00:58:25,750
there's like okay there's two row and

1356
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:30,929
six row 6 row is pretty much only grown

1357
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:33,639
in America and it has higher levels of

1358
00:58:30,929 --> 00:58:36,399
amylase that does not translate into

1359
00:58:33,639 --> 00:58:38,619
that it has higher levels of these other

1360
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:41,349
enzymes the ones I care about the chitin

1361
00:58:38,619 --> 00:58:46,509
is phosphatase for example and because

1362
00:58:41,349 --> 00:58:48,190
it's a much smaller crop a harsh and

1363
00:58:46,510 --> 00:58:53,260
crop you're gonna pay through the nose

1364
00:58:48,190 --> 00:58:55,450
for six row it isn't necessary just get

1365
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:58,980
the and again it you don't have to use

1366
00:58:55,449 --> 00:59:03,159
barley use whatever they have at the

1367
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:07,440
homebrew store and buy price now there

1368
00:59:03,159 --> 00:59:10,059
is one little caveat rye has slightly

1369
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:12,250
higher levels of phosphorus so that

1370
00:59:10,059 --> 00:59:15,940
should become really popular here with a

1371
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:19,539
certain sector of gardeners that obsess

1372
00:59:15,940 --> 00:59:24,789
about phosphorus so phosphorus is your

1373
00:59:19,539 --> 00:59:26,259
big thing then go for the rye that was

1374
00:59:24,789 --> 00:59:28,389
part one of our interview with Jim

1375
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:30,310
Bennett also known online as Clackamas

1376
00:59:28,389 --> 00:59:31,869
coot in our next installment we

1377
00:59:30,309 --> 00:59:34,029
discussed neem and further depth and

1378
00:59:31,869 --> 00:59:35,409
also the history of the one the cultivar

1379
00:59:34,030 --> 00:59:37,660
that Jim has been growing now for over

1380
00:59:35,409 --> 00:59:39,699
