00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:20,489
welcome to the cannabis cultivation and

3
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:22,890
science podcast

4
00:00:20,489 --> 00:00:25,049
I'm your host tad hussy of KISS organics

5
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,760
this is the podcast where we discussed

6
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,740
the cutting edge of organic growing from

7
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,720
a science-based perspective and drawn

8
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:32,668
top experts from around the industry to

9
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:34,679
share their wisdom and knowledge now

10
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:36,509
before starting the podcast I wanted to

11
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:38,878
just touch on the current situation with

12
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:40,259
Philo's I did reach out initially for an

13
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:42,539
interview and was told it was going to

14
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:44,549
happen I then posted four questions on

15
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:46,049
my Instagram only to spend the next two

16
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:48,179
weeks trying to get a response back

17
00:00:46,049 --> 00:00:49,799
regarding setting up the interview at

18
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:51,269
the time of this recording it appears

19
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:53,009
I'm not going to be able to get them on

20
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,930
the podcast to answer some of the hard

21
00:00:53,009 --> 00:00:57,119
questions that many of you had regarding

22
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:58,920
their latest announcements I do think

23
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:00,899
that the Reggie gaudino podcast was

24
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,730
timely and helping explain exactly what

25
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:04,799
the data can and can't be used for when

26
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:06,359
you use a genomics lab I plan on

27
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,280
releasing a video here in the next two

28
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:10,319
weeks with a discussion on the subject

29
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,359
with Eleanor from candor and Nelson from

30
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:13,949
poetry of plants as I think this is a

31
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:15,599
really important topic and has a lot of

32
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:18,420
implications regarding the future of

33
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:20,669
cannabis breeding and cultivation on a

34
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,978
similar thread the cultivation of

35
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:25,079
classic is in Portland on May 17th and

36
00:01:22,978 --> 00:01:26,909
it may 18th I'm going to try and attend

37
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:28,530
that Saturday it's a great event if

38
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:30,210
you're concerned about the relationship

podcast hey Rebecca thanks for coming on

69
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:41,430
the show hi Pat thanks for having me

70
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:43,079
yeah let's start off by giving listeners

71
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:45,900
a little bit of an idea of your

72
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:48,360
background and how you got into LED

73
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:51,270
lighting well I've always been a very

74
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:53,280
technical person I did my undergrad in

75
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:54,719
chemical engineering and then after

76
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,539
working for a few years and

77
00:02:54,719 --> 00:03:00,870
semiconductors I decided to devote my

78
00:02:57,539 --> 00:03:03,359
life to energy efficiency and went to

79
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:06,659
Purdue to study agricultural engineering

80
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:10,230
where the thought was to really research

81
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:13,919
how to best use biomass and biofuels

82
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:16,738
fuel and also replacing petrochemical

83
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:19,199
products and so in sort of a roundabout

84
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:22,670
way that led me into looking at

85
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:26,339
microalgae and microalgae led me into

86
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:28,789
deep diving into photosynthesis and what

87
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:32,219
drives different biochemical pathways in

88
00:03:28,789 --> 00:03:35,009
photosynthesis so for my PhD I ended up

89
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:38,489
at University of Texas where I was

90
00:03:35,009 --> 00:03:40,949
researching a it's a single-celled

91
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:44,099
organism blue-green algae known as

92
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:47,669
thermo Sinica caucus and it's a heat

93
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:50,069
loving cyanobacteria that I used to

94
00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:53,518
really focus on what types of

95
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:55,799
environmental stimuli effect I was

96
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,019
looking at the terpenoid pathway but I

97
00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:00,480
was also looking at gene expression so

98
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:02,549
the idea being that if I could control

99
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:04,048
the environmental stimuli in such a way

100
00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:06,840
to trigger different biochemical

101
00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:08,580
pathways I could generate I could

102
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,849
generate hydrocarbons that could then

103
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:15,000
excrete and be captured and utilized in

104
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:18,180
the petrochemical industry so this led

105
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,120
me to learning about I needed to build

106
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:23,610
my own photobioreactors and so to do so

107
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:27,240
and I also wanted to control over light

108
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:29,669
wavelength and so I I

109
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:32,780
got to do some soldering and I figured

110
00:04:29,668 --> 00:04:35,519
out how to build some LED panels and

111
00:04:32,779 --> 00:04:38,159
actually use an old Ticketmaster ticket

112
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:41,810
printing machine as my photobioreactor

113
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:44,880
shell and built the panel's built the

114
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:48,449
what's called a chemostat in order to I

115
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:51,569
had control mechanisms to monitor and

116
00:04:48,449 --> 00:04:54,330
and relay back the information from the

117
00:04:51,569 --> 00:04:57,030
the growth of the microalgae but I also

118
00:04:54,329 --> 00:04:58,649
took samples and change the conditions I

119
00:04:57,029 --> 00:05:01,918
did perturbations with light temperature

120
00:04:58,649 --> 00:05:06,209
and pH and so all of this really led me

121
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:08,818
to to become really fond of LEDs and LED

122
00:05:06,209 --> 00:05:11,519
technology and also the effect that LEDs

123
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:16,069
can have on photosynthesis and on

124
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:19,019
secondary metabolites and so this led to

125
00:05:16,069 --> 00:05:21,449
ending up in controlled environment

126
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:25,439
agriculture where I'm now working with

127
00:05:21,449 --> 00:05:28,288
growers and looking at light and my my

128
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:31,769
title is senior Application Engineer so

129
00:05:28,288 --> 00:05:35,399
I work with growers of bio sliding we we

130
00:05:31,769 --> 00:05:39,149
help to optimize their growing situation

131
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:41,370
I help with with calculations and make

132
00:05:39,149 --> 00:05:43,109
sure that we're setting up the optimal

133
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:45,629
lighting condition for what they're

134
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:48,689
trying to achieve depending on

135
00:05:45,629 --> 00:05:50,908
developmental stage and crop and so I've

136
00:05:48,689 --> 00:05:54,000
been with BIOS lighting for about two

137
00:05:50,908 --> 00:05:56,490
years and I've worked with other

138
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,879
lighting companies as well and it's just

139
00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:02,759
a huge passion of mine indoor farming

140
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:05,098
vertical growing intelligent greenhouse

141
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:07,949
systems it's all really exciting to me

142
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:10,560
and so it's kind of an interesting way

143
00:06:07,949 --> 00:06:14,189
that I got into this but it really has

144
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,228
to do with my desire to save energy to

145
00:06:14,189 --> 00:06:18,930
look at the big picture of the process

146
00:06:16,228 --> 00:06:21,060
engineering but also more recently to

147
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:23,280
understand the science behind light and

148
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:26,310
how light affects biochemical pathways

149
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:28,019
Wow that is quite the background I would

150
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:30,209
love to have you back on maybe to talk

151
00:06:28,019 --> 00:06:32,279
about microalgae at some point that's

152
00:06:30,209 --> 00:06:34,288
something that I've heard a lot about

153
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:35,399
but I haven't really done a lot of

154
00:06:34,288 --> 00:06:38,250
research on but it seems like a

155
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:39,838
fascinating topic and something that

156
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:41,069
might have a lot of applications in the

157
00:06:39,838 --> 00:06:44,939
horticulture

158
00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:47,610
I would love to cool well let's let's

159
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:50,459
dive into the the lighting stuff then

160
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:51,900
right now so let's talk a little bit one

161
00:06:50,459 --> 00:06:53,609
of the topics that you brought up that

162
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:55,889
would be really good is determining if

163
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:58,050
LEDs are right for you and your grow so

164
00:06:55,889 --> 00:07:02,610
let's just start with with the basics so

165
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:05,790
what exactly is an LED so an LED is

166
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:08,100
composed of semiconductor materials that

167
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:10,500
are sandwiched together so a

168
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:13,980
semiconductor and so I like to imagine

169
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:15,750
like a sandwich so each piece of bread

170
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:17,700
would be a different piece of

171
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:20,189
semiconductor and a semiconductor is

172
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:22,319
it's not a metal so it doesn't have free

173
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:26,670
ranging electrons that can move around

174
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:29,430
and it's not an insulator like plastic

175
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:31,500
you know or styrofoam it whereas it

176
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:33,569
doesn't have free electrons it's

177
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:36,120
somewhere in between so you take these

178
00:07:33,569 --> 00:07:40,170
two pieces of bread and you you place

179
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:42,300
them together and one piece has extra

180
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:45,180
electrons added to it and another piece

181
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:47,370
has electrons removed from it so when

182
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:49,949
you put these together what happens is

183
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:52,350
that some of them cross over and create

184
00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:55,019
what's called a depletion region so it's

185
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:58,470
like a place where it's sort of a

186
00:07:55,019 --> 00:08:04,709
barrier and so what happens is when you

187
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:06,750
apply voltage to that sandwich what

188
00:08:04,709 --> 00:08:08,009
happens is that depletion region shrinks

189
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:10,649
so it's kind of like a check valve

190
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:12,959
assembly conductor or I should say a

191
00:08:10,649 --> 00:08:15,629
diode is what I'm referring to now a

192
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:17,909
diode is like a like a check valve

193
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:20,969
because it has that that depletion

194
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:23,700
region in between so when you apply when

195
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:27,150
you apply a voltage to that what happens

196
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:32,069
is the high-energy electrons that have

197
00:08:27,149 --> 00:08:33,899
been doped on the inside will jump over

198
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:35,400
while the depletion region shrinks and

199
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:38,069
then they jump over to the side that's

200
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:41,009
missing the electrons the p-doped side

201
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:46,290
and based on the law called Planck's law

202
00:08:41,009 --> 00:08:48,899
that gap in energy releases releases

203
00:08:46,289 --> 00:08:51,329
energy in the form of a photon and it

204
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:53,399
has to do with the types of chemicals

205
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:54,400
that have been doped in the two pieces

206
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:59,829
of bread the two

207
00:08:54,399 --> 00:09:01,870
sides and but essentially material

208
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:05,110
scientists and chemists have been able

209
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:07,179
to figure out the different chemicals to

210
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:10,149
dope into these semiconductor materials

211
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:12,489
such that we can now make just about any

212
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:17,709
color we can make just about any color

213
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:20,110
of of photon come out of that bandgap

214
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:23,650
and so that's that's a really exciting

215
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:26,379
thing it used to be I think red was the

216
00:09:23,649 --> 00:09:29,740
first one it showed up on on our remote

217
00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:31,509
controls but but now we can make just

218
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:33,940
about any color in this in the visible

219
00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:38,439
spectrum and in non visible spectrum and

220
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:40,660
so that's that's how it works and not

221
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:43,840
all of these photon emissions are

222
00:09:40,659 --> 00:09:46,899
identical efficiencies so depending on

223
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:49,360
the materials that are in the in the the

224
00:09:46,899 --> 00:09:52,449
chip they could be less efficient than

225
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:56,620
other ones but but they are similar and

226
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:59,710
that they form a band so they form kind

227
00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:02,740
of a peak that has a point at the top

228
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:06,040
which is the highest intensity and it's

229
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:08,950
typically very narrow band and so when

230
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:11,980
you place different colors of these

231
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:14,950
light emitting diodes on the same board

232
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:18,070
you then get this accumulated effect of

233
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:20,460
a light spectrum and there's also

234
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:23,200
additional things people add to the

235
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:25,780
secondary optics or primary or secondary

236
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:28,930
optics to change the angle that the

237
00:10:25,779 --> 00:10:31,269
photons are coming out of the that that

238
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:33,669
are released but also they will

239
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:36,939
sometimes add coatings like phosphor

240
00:10:33,669 --> 00:10:40,209
which will do things to that narrowband

241
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:44,290
peak like level it off or kind of drop

242
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:47,950
it to maybe lower energy of wavelengths

243
00:10:44,289 --> 00:10:51,339
so in the end you have this ability to

244
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:54,340
to put together narrow Peaks but you

245
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:56,200
also can add chemistry's to the optics

246
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:59,470
in order to change how that light

247
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:04,810
submitted and you can basically come up

248
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:08,230
with any spectrum you desire and some of

249
00:11:04,809 --> 00:11:11,109
the benefits of LEDs are they're very

250
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:14,379
small there they're much more efficient

251
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:16,269
than legacy lighting technologies which

252
00:11:14,379 --> 00:11:19,149
typically have to go through gas

253
00:11:16,269 --> 00:11:22,360
discharge and they are used up faster

254
00:11:19,149 --> 00:11:24,519
the ignited energy to use up quickly so

255
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:27,850
having this kind of solid-state

256
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:30,220
technology is it's very efficient

257
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:33,310
the downside is it's expensive it's

258
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:36,910
expensive to to make some my conductors

259
00:11:33,309 --> 00:11:39,849
it's expensive to to do the optics and

260
00:11:36,909 --> 00:11:43,149
to manufacture them so the prices are

261
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:45,250
going down but it's it's still a much

262
00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:48,429
more expensive option upfront than some

263
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:50,830
legacy lighting so yeah that's a general

264
00:11:48,429 --> 00:11:52,209
overview so when you're saying legacy

265
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:55,720
lighting what you're referring to is

266
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:58,810
things like high pressure sodium metal

267
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:02,410
halide compact fluorescent lighting

268
00:11:58,809 --> 00:12:03,219
those types of lighting technologies yes

269
00:12:02,409 --> 00:12:06,279
that's correct

270
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:09,850
and the way that those work is they have

271
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:12,819
a gas which is ignited by an arc the arc

272
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:15,370
has to come from a ballast which creates

273
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:18,790
or a high voltage and then once that

274
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:22,179
high voltage is set and the gas is

275
00:12:18,789 --> 00:12:24,490
ignited in the case of high pressure

276
00:12:22,179 --> 00:12:28,239
sodium the mercury then turns into a

277
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:30,700
vapor state and stays lit so one of the

278
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,669
differences between LEDs and those types

279
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:37,000
of of fixtures that is that they require

280
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:39,429
that ballast that can control the

281
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,299
initial spark but also the maintenance

282
00:12:39,429 --> 00:12:45,009
energy required for the bulb to stay lit

283
00:12:42,299 --> 00:12:47,459
so that that's another major difference

284
00:12:45,009 --> 00:12:51,039
between the legacy lighting and

285
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:52,629
solid-state technology like LEDs well

286
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:56,860
let's talk a little bit about efficiency

287
00:12:52,629 --> 00:12:59,110
then because one of the things that came

288
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:01,570
to light recently for me was visiting a

289
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:03,039
facility with a with the power meter and

290
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:05,350
we'll talk a little bit more about these

291
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:09,969
these types of measurements but they

292
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:11,379
were at 400 ppfd at canopy thinking they

293
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:14,259
were at a thousand because they're the

294
00:13:11,379 --> 00:13:16,840
lighting the bulbs in their double-ended

295
00:13:14,259 --> 00:13:19,269
kavita's hadn't been replaced in quite a

296
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:22,000
while and so they didn't realize that

297
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:24,009
this was going on

298
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:28,029
which is a pretty significant drop in

299
00:13:24,009 --> 00:13:30,039
light intensity so how efficient are a

300
00:13:28,029 --> 00:13:32,259
lot of these LED lights in terms of

301
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:35,230
maintaining a spectrum and light

302
00:13:32,259 --> 00:13:39,029
intensity over time well that's a really

303
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:41,670
great observation and example because

304
00:13:39,029 --> 00:13:47,019
one of the major differences between

305
00:13:41,669 --> 00:13:49,209
LEDs and HPS and metal halide is that

306
00:13:47,019 --> 00:13:53,079
over time the metal halide

307
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:56,860
le and and HP s they tend to have a

308
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:59,379
higher depreciation rate and so some of

309
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:01,509
it has to do with the way in which they

310
00:13:59,379 --> 00:14:04,840
emit light because it's burning through

311
00:14:01,509 --> 00:14:06,639
the gas that's inside the bulb and over

312
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:11,050
time that depreciates

313
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:14,500
but also there's other things so for

314
00:14:11,049 --> 00:14:16,899
instance LEDs tend to be a little bit

315
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:19,870
more anti-static so they tend to resist

316
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:22,870
dust accumulation better than HBS or

317
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:25,840
metal halide and you'd be surprised how

318
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:29,830
much dust and debris can actually drop

319
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:32,470
light emission from a fixture and so if

320
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:35,020
you imagine putting your sunglasses in a

321
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:37,839
grow room the next day or two days later

322
00:14:35,019 --> 00:14:40,600
you're probably going to need to wipe

323
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:42,610
them off before you wear them and that's

324
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:46,570
just because in the grow room there's

325
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:48,759
there's moisture and debris and so over

326
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:52,230
time you might not see that when you

327
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:54,370
look at the lights directly but there's

328
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:57,639
accumulation that's actually dropping

329
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:59,529
your your light output and there tends

330
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:01,929
to be more of that with legacy lighting

331
00:14:59,529 --> 00:15:03,490
so you have both the the drop in

332
00:15:01,929 --> 00:15:06,189
efficiency over time that's much faster

333
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:09,339
than with solid-state technology but you

334
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:11,890
also have more dust accumulation and if

335
00:15:09,339 --> 00:15:14,950
you're not real amping and replacing the

336
00:15:11,889 --> 00:15:17,230
lamps of fast enough and it could

337
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:22,180
definitely impact your grow operation in

338
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:26,110
your productivity so that's makes a very

339
00:15:22,179 --> 00:15:27,699
good case for having a par meter in your

340
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:30,700
in your growing facility or having

341
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:32,110
access to one that but can we talk a

342
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:34,839
little about like what you're measuring

343
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:35,560
when you use a power meter sure it's

344
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:37,779
definitely

345
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:40,179
recommended to have a light meter that

346
00:15:37,778 --> 00:15:43,389
that measures par and that's

347
00:15:40,179 --> 00:15:45,969
photosynthetically active radiation so

348
00:15:43,389 --> 00:15:49,149
you you want to be able to measure how

349
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:50,950
much light is within that range - as you

350
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:53,259
mentioned see how it's changing over

351
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:56,560
time also confirm that you're getting

352
00:15:53,259 --> 00:15:57,759
uniform light onto the canopy and make

353
00:15:56,559 --> 00:16:01,419
sure that you're getting the amount of

354
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:03,819
light that you're expecting so I like to

355
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:07,240
describe light I like to describe

356
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:09,640
photons and it's a little bit this is

357
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:13,778
over my head because I'm not a physicist

358
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:15,639
but you know light can be thought of as

359
00:16:13,778 --> 00:16:18,159
a particle even though it doesn't

360
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:20,049
technically have a mass I like to think

361
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:23,829
of it as a particle so I like to use the

362
00:16:20,049 --> 00:16:26,620
analogy of rain and when I when I talk

363
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:30,250
about ppfd which is the photosynthetic

364
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:33,039
photon flux density it's like how many

365
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:37,000
drops of rain you have in a square meter

366
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:40,419
per second so in terms of ppfd the unit

367
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,419
are the micro moles of photons per meter

368
00:16:40,419 --> 00:16:45,250
squared per second and we use micro

369
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:51,610
moles because you don't want to have to

370
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:53,769
say 1 times 10 to the 6 moles of photons

371
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:56,529
per meter squared per second and we use

372
00:16:53,769 --> 00:17:00,370
moles because it just so happens that

373
00:16:56,529 --> 00:17:01,720
that unit which is 10 oh boy I believe

374
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:04,838
it's 10 to the twenty-third it's

375
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:07,480
Avogadro's number that that gives us

376
00:17:04,838 --> 00:17:11,470
nice values that brings down the numbers

377
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:15,759
to in the hundreds as opposed to way too

378
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:19,809
big to use it on a daily basis so we use

379
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:23,140
the the unit micro moles as a way to

380
00:17:19,809 --> 00:17:25,869
shorten the number and and so now we

381
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:28,240
have nice ranges to work with 800 to a

382
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:33,399
thousand for bloom for example as a

383
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:35,529
common range so so for for measuring

384
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:38,800
that light you definitely want to have a

385
00:17:35,529 --> 00:17:40,420
light meter that can measure the number

386
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:43,389
of particles that you're getting of

387
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:46,179
those photons per meter squared per

388
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:48,429
second so we're using the power meter to

389
00:17:46,179 --> 00:17:49,420
not only look at light intensity but

390
00:17:48,429 --> 00:17:52,090
also light dish

391
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:53,769
tribution so we can look at to make sure

392
00:17:52,089 --> 00:17:56,740
there's no I mean we call them hot spots

393
00:17:53,769 --> 00:17:58,269
with HPS lighting back in the day I

394
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:00,460
don't know if it's the same with LEDs

395
00:17:58,269 --> 00:18:04,109
but just determining that we have an

396
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:07,930
even canopy of light across the entire I

397
00:18:04,109 --> 00:18:10,619
guess the lighting space absolutely you

398
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:13,630
also can use your par meter to measure

399
00:18:10,619 --> 00:18:16,509
within the canopy it's amazing how

400
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:19,270
quickly light is consumed in the first

401
00:18:16,509 --> 00:18:21,640
few centimeters of a canopy so you might

402
00:18:19,269 --> 00:18:23,650
you might just out of curiosity test to

403
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:25,750
see how your light is penetrating

404
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:27,550
through the canopy you might want to

405
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:30,789
make sure that you're adjusting your

406
00:18:27,549 --> 00:18:34,089
life so that they hit mostly onto the

407
00:18:30,789 --> 00:18:36,329
canopy and not wasted for an example if

408
00:18:34,089 --> 00:18:40,359
you have grow beds you wouldn't want

409
00:18:36,329 --> 00:18:42,669
your grow light to hit the walkways or

410
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:44,949
the walls for example so so there's

411
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:49,000
there's many reasons why you would want

412
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:51,100
to have the light meter and and if you

413
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,589
would like I can talk about how you can

414
00:18:51,099 --> 00:18:56,349
do basic calculations but then you could

415
00:18:53,589 --> 00:18:58,929
use your light meter to confirm flight

416
00:18:56,349 --> 00:19:00,849
levels yes I would definitely like to go

417
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:04,080
into that one question I had before we

418
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:06,909
we do is how do I as a consumer

419
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:10,119
determine differences in LED technology

420
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:11,950
because if I go to a trade show nowadays

421
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:13,989
there's probably 10 different companies

422
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:15,340
at that trade show all selling LED

423
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:19,150
lights and they range from purple

424
00:19:15,339 --> 00:19:20,559
spectrum to adjustable spectrum to what

425
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:22,840
people are calling full spectrum

426
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:25,389
lighting they range in size and

427
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:27,279
intensity how do we make this an apples

428
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:29,680
to apples comparison as a consumer like

429
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:30,940
what questions should we be asking of a

430
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:33,820
lighting company when we're trying to

431
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:37,900
decide you know a pretty major expense

432
00:19:33,819 --> 00:19:40,720
for a facility well I think I have kind

433
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:43,650
of a unique background in that I studied

434
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:47,049
photosynthesis in some of the most basic

435
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:49,300
microorganisms on earth so cyanobacteria

436
00:19:47,049 --> 00:19:51,849
are essentially what became the

437
00:19:49,299 --> 00:19:54,879
chloroplast in the land plant so when I

438
00:19:51,849 --> 00:19:59,199
studied cyanobacteria what I found was

439
00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:02,710
that the light the spectrum it did

440
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,548
matter whether it was red or blue or how

441
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:06,009
much green I

442
00:20:03,548 --> 00:20:07,329
using in my research I did look at

443
00:20:06,009 --> 00:20:09,940
spectrum and it did have some

444
00:20:07,329 --> 00:20:12,038
differences on photosynthesis but one

445
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:14,169
chart that I like to show and

446
00:20:12,038 --> 00:20:17,349
presentations that I think really

447
00:20:14,169 --> 00:20:20,139
exemplifies how land plants have evolved

448
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:23,048
is a chart that compares simple

449
00:20:20,138 --> 00:20:25,298
organisms like micro out like finer

450
00:20:23,048 --> 00:20:27,970
bacteria and then later micro algae and

451
00:20:25,298 --> 00:20:31,179
then later land plants and it shows how

452
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:34,889
as you go up in complexity the light

453
00:20:31,179 --> 00:20:38,409
absorption of the more complicated

454
00:20:34,888 --> 00:20:40,719
organisms it broadens out and it makes

455
00:20:38,409 --> 00:20:44,590
sense that it broadens out to a more

456
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:48,100
even spectrum because you now have

457
00:20:44,589 --> 00:20:50,288
additional biomass that's reflecting and

458
00:20:48,099 --> 00:20:52,358
refracting light as the light travels

459
00:20:50,288 --> 00:20:54,759
through the tissue to get to the

460
00:20:52,358 --> 00:20:58,028
photosynthetic centers which are inside

461
00:20:54,759 --> 00:21:00,759
the chloroplast you also have more

462
00:20:58,028 --> 00:21:03,759
complicated antennae so you have a

463
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:05,858
variety of pigments as accessory

464
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:10,089
pigments that are helping the light drop

465
00:21:05,858 --> 00:21:12,608
down into the photosystem and so from my

466
00:21:10,089 --> 00:21:15,158
research and from what I've seen in the

467
00:21:12,608 --> 00:21:17,798
literature as you get into land plants

468
00:21:15,159 --> 00:21:20,919
you can get away with a broad spectrum

469
00:21:17,798 --> 00:21:23,378
and so I'm convinced that broad spectrum

470
00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:26,710
is the way to go but it's not just from

471
00:21:23,378 --> 00:21:28,658
the scientific literature is also is so

472
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:30,879
much easier on humans it's so much

473
00:21:28,659 --> 00:21:33,580
easier for us to be able to observe

474
00:21:30,878 --> 00:21:35,769
plants look at them see them when you

475
00:21:33,579 --> 00:21:39,069
have a broad spectrum than it is when

476
00:21:35,769 --> 00:21:43,298
you have just red and blue which is a

477
00:21:39,069 --> 00:21:46,210
very harsh light for people so I'm a big

478
00:21:43,298 --> 00:21:48,849
proponent of broad spectrum and then

479
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:52,389
when it comes to additional lighting

480
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:54,308
there are light responses that are not

481
00:21:52,388 --> 00:21:56,199
related to photosynthesis they're more

482
00:21:54,308 --> 00:21:58,329
related to developmental growth those

483
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:00,278
are photo morphogenic responses and

484
00:21:58,329 --> 00:22:03,308
certain light wavelengths will

485
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:05,878
definitely trigger photo receptors that

486
00:22:03,308 --> 00:22:10,148
are involved in photo morphogenic

487
00:22:05,878 --> 00:22:13,898
responses however it's really hard to

488
00:22:10,148 --> 00:22:17,219
make a statement that for example a

489
00:22:13,898 --> 00:22:20,109
particular UV light will definitely call

490
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:25,019
additional secondary metabolites a and B

491
00:22:20,109 --> 00:22:27,369
or profile changes to C and D in a more

492
00:22:25,019 --> 00:22:30,129
in a higher productivity because

493
00:22:27,369 --> 00:22:33,549
oftentimes treatments that cause stress

494
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:35,920
also drop overall plant productivity so

495
00:22:33,549 --> 00:22:38,950
it's a balance just like with microalgae

496
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:42,250
it's a balance between figuring out ways

497
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:44,769
to get the the cells or the plant to

498
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:47,619
grow really really strong and then maybe

499
00:22:44,769 --> 00:22:51,160
trigger a particular type of biochemical

500
00:22:47,619 --> 00:22:53,949
response but there's so much complexity

501
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:57,730
with life and there's so much complexity

502
00:22:53,950 --> 00:23:01,019
with with even microalgae even sign of

503
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:04,000
bacteria that it's hard to give blanket

504
00:23:01,019 --> 00:23:07,799
statements on how particular wavelengths

505
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:11,289
will affect productivity and profiles of

506
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:14,649
particular secondary metabolites so my

507
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:18,430
suggestion then is go with a light that

508
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:21,460
gives you good overall efficiency or

509
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:23,860
efficacy as I call it and go with one

510
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:26,110
that's a broad spectrum so it's easier

511
00:23:23,859 --> 00:23:29,019
on your eyes but also it's it's

512
00:23:26,109 --> 00:23:32,799
absolutely going to be utilized by by

513
00:23:29,019 --> 00:23:35,889
land plants and and look for look for

514
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:39,299
companies that that make good products

515
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:41,920
so make sure that they've they've had

516
00:23:39,299 --> 00:23:43,480
outside testing make sure they're

517
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,160
accredited all of those things are

518
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,630
really important make sure they know

519
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:50,890
what they're talking about when it comes

520
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:53,580
to photo biology and light and and try

521
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:55,600
to learn about the quality of the

522
00:23:53,579 --> 00:23:58,720
fixtures themselves make sure that

523
00:23:55,599 --> 00:24:00,519
they're built strong industrial strength

524
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:03,430
because you don't want to invest that

525
00:24:00,519 --> 00:24:05,410
much money in lights that will not last

526
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:08,769
long it's a very it's a big investment

527
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:11,200
so so you want to make sure that you go

528
00:24:08,769 --> 00:24:14,619
with a company that that you know has

529
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:16,960
makes a good product now visually can we

530
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:18,939
see differences in full spectrum

531
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,620
lighting I assume there is differences a

532
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:22,150
slight differences at least it may not

533
00:24:20,619 --> 00:24:27,459
be visible by the human eye is that

534
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:30,160
accurate oh sure yeah if if one if one

535
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:31,090
spectrum has a little bit more if you

536
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:33,100
look at aspect

537
00:24:31,089 --> 00:24:37,029
you'll see it goes it ranges in

538
00:24:33,099 --> 00:24:39,339
nanometers and that's the width of the

539
00:24:37,029 --> 00:24:42,490
the particle the photon particle and its

540
00:24:39,339 --> 00:24:46,389
movement through space but as you look

541
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:48,849
at that range like 300 to 700 you can

542
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:53,920
actually see differences with your eye

543
00:24:48,849 --> 00:24:56,169
so if one company has a has more as a

544
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:59,170
broad peak more in the orange area

545
00:24:56,170 --> 00:25:02,860
you'll see fight Li more orangish look

546
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:06,850
in the room but as long as it's got a

547
00:25:02,859 --> 00:25:09,329
decent amount of greens maybe even in

548
00:25:06,849 --> 00:25:13,149
the yellows that will help significantly

549
00:25:09,329 --> 00:25:16,480
for plant visualization and making sure

550
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:19,300
you can see the plants in case there's

551
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:21,789
any type of disease outbreak you want to

552
00:25:19,299 --> 00:25:25,539
be able to to look at the plant if you

553
00:25:21,789 --> 00:25:27,369
have only blue and red then it makes it

554
00:25:25,539 --> 00:25:30,009
very difficult the plants will look gray

555
00:25:27,369 --> 00:25:31,569
or black and it makes it hard to

556
00:25:30,009 --> 00:25:34,539
visualize them and you have your grow

557
00:25:31,569 --> 00:25:36,339
lights on is it fair to say then that at

558
00:25:34,539 --> 00:25:39,730
this point in time when comparing

559
00:25:36,339 --> 00:25:42,309
full-spectrum light it's really it's

560
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:44,200
really that every every LED company has

561
00:25:42,309 --> 00:25:46,119
a slightly different take on what they

562
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:52,690
feel like is optimal right now for plant

563
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:57,009
growth I think so um so my personal take

564
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:59,230
is I want to save energy I want to get

565
00:25:57,009 --> 00:26:01,359
the biggest productivity from the plant

566
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:05,309
with the least amount electricity going

567
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:08,829
in so for me it's not so much about

568
00:26:05,309 --> 00:26:13,690
whether it the green broad peak is

569
00:26:08,829 --> 00:26:15,629
centered on 555 or 556 it's that we make

570
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:18,779
a good product that lasts a long time

571
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:21,040
that gives a good broad range of light

572
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:24,190
so that the plants can grow most

573
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:26,829
efficiently as possible so I think I

574
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:30,220
think I can say that for for my company

575
00:26:26,829 --> 00:26:33,369
stands as well but we we're really about

576
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:37,420
making a good solid product that grows

577
00:26:33,369 --> 00:26:40,629
plants well and we're not really in the

578
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:43,990
business of determining exactly which

579
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:44,890
nanometer wavelength might affect one

580
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:47,650
particular

581
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:49,690
devar under one set of conditions we

582
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:52,960
really want to make a good solid light

583
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:55,090
that is that lasts a long time but is

584
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:59,470
also efficient that's been our that's

585
00:26:55,089 --> 00:27:00,579
been our our motivation our aim yeah you

586
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:02,799
alluded to a good point there that

587
00:27:00,579 --> 00:27:04,960
there's a lot of variables going on

588
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:06,690
outside of lighting they can all affect

589
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,039
plant growth and it really is a

590
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:12,150
culmination of all of these variables

591
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:14,529
whether it's soil or nutrients or

592
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:16,810
environmental conditions that will

593
00:27:14,529 --> 00:27:20,259
affect a plant's growth and even the

594
00:27:16,809 --> 00:27:21,549
cultivar itself so yes from a lighting

595
00:27:20,259 --> 00:27:23,920
perspective you're just trying to give

596
00:27:21,549 --> 00:27:26,700
what you guys feel is optimal for a

597
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:27,880
variety of conditions and environments

598
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:30,340
absolutely

599
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:32,530
yeah the genotype has a huge part in it

600
00:27:30,339 --> 00:27:35,949
and there's so much we don't understand

601
00:27:32,529 --> 00:27:39,069
about it about gene expression and how

602
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:41,710
all of these millions of chemical

603
00:27:39,069 --> 00:27:43,779
reactions are connected so it's

604
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:46,240
important for us as a lighting

605
00:27:43,779 --> 00:27:47,950
manufacturer to make a solid light that

606
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,859
provides a broad spectrum that we know

607
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:52,299
plants can utilize okay well let's talk

608
00:27:50,859 --> 00:27:54,039
a little bit this calculations that you

609
00:27:52,299 --> 00:27:58,029
you mentioned so how do you calculate

610
00:27:54,039 --> 00:28:00,159
fixture efficacy so fixture efficacy is

611
00:27:58,029 --> 00:28:03,149
a is a great one to use when you're

612
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:06,640
comparing different lighting options so

613
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:09,519
the way you would calculate that is you

614
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,620
would divide the output of the light by

615
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:15,220
the amount of Watts that go into it

616
00:28:11,619 --> 00:28:17,799
so the output of a grow light should be

617
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:20,940
given in units of micro mole per second

618
00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:24,789
so earlier we talked about the ppfd and

619
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:27,759
that's the micro moles photons per meter

620
00:28:24,789 --> 00:28:31,269
squared per second well the light puts

621
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:32,950
out a set amount of light and and in the

622
00:28:31,269 --> 00:28:36,190
case of horticultural lighting it's

623
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:39,430
given in units of PPF photosynthetic

624
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:43,269
photon flux or micro moles per second so

625
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:45,250
first red flag would be if the lighting

626
00:28:43,269 --> 00:28:47,829
company doesn't provide that information

627
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:50,440
that should be on their spec sheets and

628
00:28:47,829 --> 00:28:53,799
their website that's measured by putting

629
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:56,950
the light into a like a light collecting

630
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:58,839
sphere and the sphere measures at the

631
00:28:56,950 --> 00:29:02,319
absolute amount of light that comes

632
00:28:58,839 --> 00:29:05,019
off of that fixture so you take that

633
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:06,819
value the micro moles per second and you

634
00:29:05,019 --> 00:29:10,180
divide it by the amount of watts I go

635
00:29:06,819 --> 00:29:14,259
into the light so all of this should be

636
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:16,390
done a second party testing but it never

637
00:29:14,259 --> 00:29:18,910
hurts to plug in your own watt meter

638
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:22,090
just confirm of the wattage of your

639
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:25,690
running calculations on on fixtures that

640
00:29:22,089 --> 00:29:27,879
you currently own so you can always just

641
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:30,070
plug in a watt meter into the kilowatt

642
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:32,020
is one brand I like to use plug it into

643
00:29:30,069 --> 00:29:33,549
the wall and you get the actual amount

644
00:29:32,019 --> 00:29:38,559
of watts that are being used by that

645
00:29:33,549 --> 00:29:41,379
device so in the case of LEDs they range

646
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:44,339
from the micro moles per second divided

647
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:47,890
by the wasps which is joules per second

648
00:29:44,339 --> 00:29:50,619
they range from around like two to more

649
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:53,950
recent LEDs are coming out in the almost

650
00:29:50,619 --> 00:29:55,509
up to three micro moles per second

651
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:58,509
divided by joules per second which is

652
00:29:55,509 --> 00:30:00,519
micro moles per Joule so the the

653
00:29:58,509 --> 00:30:04,960
efficacy is given in units of micro

654
00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:07,359
moles per Joule and for H PS and metal

655
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:09,400
halide they tend to be lower just

656
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:12,879
because of the the nature of the the

657
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:15,430
light but that's one way that you can

658
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:18,340
compare between different lighting

659
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:20,890
systems in terms of their efficacy it's

660
00:30:18,339 --> 00:30:23,409
simply doing the light output divided by

661
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:27,070
the watson and i assume that difference

662
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:30,190
there is put off in heat essentially

663
00:30:27,069 --> 00:30:32,500
because there's no energy there's no

664
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:34,269
energy loss it's a basic basic law of

665
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,769
thermodynamics I seem so the the

666
00:30:34,269 --> 00:30:39,460
difference there is coming off of the

667
00:30:35,769 --> 00:30:40,150
light somehow heat transfer as energy is

668
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:44,170
that right

669
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:47,350
so to get the same amount of photons out

670
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:51,279
you need less wattage in for an LED

671
00:30:47,349 --> 00:30:55,240
light and so the difference is is just

672
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:57,670
how much difference you have on that

673
00:30:55,240 --> 00:31:01,000
conversion from electrical energy into

674
00:30:57,670 --> 00:31:01,360
photon emission sure I guess what I'm

675
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,599
wondering

676
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:06,369
I'm not phrasing this very well so we

677
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:08,859
have this a set amount of energy coming

678
00:31:06,369 --> 00:31:11,799
into the light that the measure of

679
00:31:08,859 --> 00:31:12,639
efficiency is how effective that light

680
00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:15,149
is a

681
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:18,759
transferring that electrical energy into

682
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:20,140
photons exactly yep that's right so

683
00:31:18,759 --> 00:31:22,269
where's the extra energy going is that

684
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:25,390
what the heat is that's put off by you

685
00:31:22,269 --> 00:31:29,230
know more typically with with HPPS or

686
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:32,970
metal halide lights yeah so it is um

687
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:37,569
yeah the general answer would be yes

688
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:39,610
LEDs still they still do have micro

689
00:31:37,569 --> 00:31:41,919
levels of heat on the chip themselves

690
00:31:39,609 --> 00:31:43,659
but they also have you'll see LEDs will

691
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:45,640
either have passive or active cooling

692
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:47,860
because the boards and the electrical

693
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:51,070
components generate some heat but yes

694
00:31:47,859 --> 00:31:54,309
that's right the HBS and metal halide

695
00:31:51,069 --> 00:31:56,589
lights they they generate more heat

696
00:31:54,309 --> 00:31:58,750
because of the way in which they're

697
00:31:56,589 --> 00:32:00,459
igniting the gas and and there's a lot

698
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:02,740
of wasted heat in that process of

699
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:05,980
converting electricity into photons

700
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:09,640
that's right now I've heard some growers

701
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:11,200
talk more recently about heat coming off

702
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:15,990
of the light onto the leaf surface

703
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:18,309
itself as a benefit for that plant

704
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:20,859
versus controlling it environmentally

705
00:32:18,309 --> 00:32:22,659
more through your HVAC system have you

706
00:32:20,859 --> 00:32:25,899
seen any research on that showing that

707
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:28,000
somehow this this heated heat exchanger

708
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:29,890
or heat onto the light it from the light

709
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,740
itself along with the photons is somehow

710
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:35,200
more beneficial then in a controlled

711
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:37,150
environment like that I've heard that as

712
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:40,360
well but I haven't seen the research

713
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:44,830
myself so I would love to to learn more

714
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:48,099
about it if if more heat turns out to be

715
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:51,159
the answer to certain cultivars and that

716
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:53,230
is beneficial there are other ways to

717
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:57,160
generate heat that's more efficient than

718
00:32:53,230 --> 00:33:01,000
the waste heat from the HPS for example

719
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:02,500
so it still could be cost effective and

720
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,809
it still could give you a return on

721
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:08,259
investment if you considered switching

722
00:33:04,809 --> 00:33:10,750
to LEDs or doing LEDs instead of HBS and

723
00:33:08,259 --> 00:33:14,710
adding that heat in another way so I

724
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:18,279
would I would say it's interesting I

725
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:21,579
would love to to see more data in the

726
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:23,139
literature about that and and sometimes

727
00:33:21,579 --> 00:33:24,849
I've heard it has to do you know the

728
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:25,770
directionality of the heat and people

729
00:33:24,849 --> 00:33:29,579
are looking

730
00:33:25,769 --> 00:33:33,089
different ways to add heat in yeah in

731
00:33:29,579 --> 00:33:35,609
certain areas of the plant but but if

732
00:33:33,089 --> 00:33:38,029
it's in general if it's just the heating

733
00:33:35,609 --> 00:33:41,849
of the room then I highly recommend

734
00:33:38,029 --> 00:33:44,730
using you know using a more efficient

735
00:33:41,849 --> 00:33:47,308
LED light and then and then maintaining

736
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:49,769
that heat with HVAC it's much more

737
00:33:47,308 --> 00:33:53,970
efficient that way and that's another

738
00:33:49,769 --> 00:33:56,970
benefit of LEDs is in the sense that you

739
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:59,400
can go with it's a lower load on your

740
00:33:56,970 --> 00:34:01,799
HVAC system because there is less heat

741
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:04,290
being generated because typically you're

742
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:07,259
you're trying you're battling heat in

743
00:34:04,289 --> 00:34:09,929
those systems right yes absolutely so

744
00:34:07,259 --> 00:34:12,389
you you save on the initial conversion

745
00:34:09,929 --> 00:34:14,789
process and then you also save on the

746
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:17,369
HVAC as well great so how do you

747
00:34:14,789 --> 00:34:20,820
calculate ppfd from photoperiod in DL i

748
00:34:17,369 --> 00:34:23,970
so in order to calculate the photon flux

749
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:26,429
density let's say let's say that you

750
00:34:23,969 --> 00:34:28,500
know what the DL I the daily light

751
00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:31,079
integral is for the plant that you're

752
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:34,050
growing and you know your photo period

753
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:36,239
you can calculate what light intensity

754
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:40,679
you would need for that photo period so

755
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:42,868
so for example let's just assume that

756
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:45,510
the plant you're growing needs it has a

757
00:34:42,869 --> 00:34:49,320
DI and this is a very high daily light

758
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:51,600
integral of 60 moles per meter squared

759
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:55,200
per day so this is on the very high end

760
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:57,509
but it turns out that plants have an

761
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:59,579
optimal amount of light that they need

762
00:34:57,510 --> 00:35:02,040
to receive in a day they can receive

763
00:34:59,579 --> 00:35:03,750
that light of course within boundaries

764
00:35:02,039 --> 00:35:06,259
but they can receive that light in a

765
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:09,300
shorter time period at a more intense

766
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:12,750
ppfd or they can receive it in a longer

767
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:15,840
time period at a less intense ppfd so in

768
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:19,590
order to calculate what your ppfd would

769
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:21,450
be if you know if you know the D Li and

770
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:24,660
you know how long you're going to run

771
00:35:21,449 --> 00:35:26,819
the light then there's a set ppfd that

772
00:35:24,659 --> 00:35:28,769
you're going to target so to do the

773
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:33,210
calculation what you would do is you

774
00:35:28,769 --> 00:35:36,809
would take your your your di which is 60

775
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:39,400
moles 60 moles per meter squared per day

776
00:35:36,809 --> 00:35:41,710
and I usually

777
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:45,670
we'll just do the conversions as like

778
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:49,240
fractions and so you need to convert

779
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:53,889
those units to end up with ppfd so to do

780
00:35:49,239 --> 00:35:55,719
so you need to convert one day equals 18

781
00:35:53,889 --> 00:35:58,900
hours in your case because you're

782
00:35:55,719 --> 00:36:03,399
running it for 18 hours you convert one

783
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:07,599
hour equals 30 3600 seconds

784
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:11,500
and then you would convert one mol is 1

785
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:15,250
times 10 to the 6 micro moles so I'd be

786
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:19,028
happy to to draw this out or share this

787
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:21,010
with the with the audience later if you

788
00:36:19,028 --> 00:36:25,329
would like but when you do these

789
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:29,230
calculations you end up with 60 times 1

790
00:36:25,329 --> 00:36:36,510
times 10 to the 6th then divided by 18

791
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:40,449
times 3,600 and you end up with 925 0.9

792
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:42,730
ppfd or 920 5.9 micro moles per meter

793
00:36:40,449 --> 00:36:45,338
squared per second so what that tells

794
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:47,679
you is if you are limited by a photo

795
00:36:45,338 --> 00:36:49,989
period of 18 hours and that's what

796
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:52,618
you're going to be running and you know

797
00:36:49,989 --> 00:36:55,659
that your plant needs so much light you

798
00:36:52,619 --> 00:36:57,789
you know that it needs in this case 60

799
00:36:55,659 --> 00:37:00,308
moles per meter squared per day you now

800
00:36:57,789 --> 00:37:05,140
know that that light intensity is going

801
00:37:00,309 --> 00:37:06,609
to need to be 920 5.9 or so micro moles

802
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:08,650
per meter square second and that's when

803
00:37:06,608 --> 00:37:10,239
you can take your light meter and make

804
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:13,028
sure that your light is coming out that

805
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:15,038
bright any less than that and you're not

806
00:37:13,028 --> 00:37:17,739
you're not utilizing the plant to its

807
00:37:15,039 --> 00:37:20,589
full capacity more than that and you're

808
00:37:17,739 --> 00:37:22,629
stressing the plant and so the deal lie

809
00:37:20,588 --> 00:37:25,058
has been determined for a variety of

810
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:29,170
crops and you can find that information

811
00:37:25,059 --> 00:37:31,059
in Agra extension papers Purdue Cornell

812
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:34,568
different universities have published

813
00:37:31,059 --> 00:37:37,589
the DLI for different plants and when

814
00:37:34,568 --> 00:37:39,670
you know the DLI it really helps you to

815
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:41,920
determine how to optimize your light

816
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:43,358
levels and definitely you'll want the

817
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:46,809
light meter to confirm those light

818
00:37:43,358 --> 00:37:49,449
levels now I saw a study well before I

819
00:37:46,809 --> 00:37:50,829
get into that let me just say that we'll

820
00:37:49,449 --> 00:37:52,449
put some of this information on the

821
00:37:50,829 --> 00:37:53,920
podcast page for people who want to look

822
00:37:52,449 --> 00:37:55,119
at those numbers a little bit more

823
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:58,090
I realized that was a lot of

824
00:37:55,119 --> 00:38:02,250
calculations so what I was wondering

825
00:37:58,090 --> 00:38:05,470
though in terms of DL I I did see a

826
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:07,809
trial by Allison Justice who have had on

827
00:38:05,469 --> 00:38:11,139
the podcast where she looked at light

828
00:38:07,809 --> 00:38:14,529
levels of 800 ppfd a thousand ppfd and

829
00:38:11,139 --> 00:38:18,819
1200 ppfd across a specific cultivar of

830
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:21,900
cannabis and found that this is a quick

831
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:25,780
summary of the research basically that

832
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:29,769
in terms of yield versus the amount of

833
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:31,900
wattage or efficiency of that yield 1000

834
00:38:29,769 --> 00:38:34,509
was the most effective out of those 3

835
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:36,460
and 1200 they got slightly more yield

836
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:38,590
but the cost to receive that yield was

837
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:41,519
was higher in electricity that offset

838
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:44,680
the cost of the the value of it so

839
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:46,539
you're throwing out the number 925 have

840
00:38:44,679 --> 00:38:48,609
you is that sort of the DLI that you

841
00:38:46,539 --> 00:38:50,259
guys are using for cannabis right now or

842
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:54,099
do you have any research on what's

843
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:58,330
optimal for cannabis well that number is

844
00:38:54,099 --> 00:39:03,639
based on an example calculation of 60

845
00:38:58,329 --> 00:39:06,819
DOI with 18 our light cycle but we've

846
00:39:03,639 --> 00:39:10,029
seen a variety of grow conditions and

847
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:13,510
we've seen you know depends on this

848
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:17,470
developmental stage so yeah we've seen a

849
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:22,270
whole range even with bloom we've seen

850
00:39:17,469 --> 00:39:24,669
ranging from 350 to 1200 so I think a

851
00:39:22,269 --> 00:39:26,829
lot of that has to do with the grower

852
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:29,680
and all the other parameters are using

853
00:39:26,829 --> 00:39:35,199
and how they all interact the cultivar

854
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:38,710
all of that so we you know we will help

855
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:42,579
with providing ranges and we also help

856
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:46,150
to to specify out for instance

857
00:39:42,579 --> 00:39:48,309
greenhouses based on the average amount

858
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:51,280
of DLI that the greenhouse should

859
00:39:48,309 --> 00:39:53,259
receive based on the location and how

860
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:55,390
much additional lighting they would need

861
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:58,570
to meet the basic requirements of the

862
00:39:55,389 --> 00:40:03,069
plants that they're growing but but in

863
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:05,050
terms of what we recommend we we it's a

864
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:07,660
conversation we have with the grower to

865
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:10,060
find out how they've been growing and

866
00:40:07,659 --> 00:40:13,179
it's also that combined with what we've

867
00:40:10,059 --> 00:40:17,170
seen so it's kind of a big range so I

868
00:40:13,179 --> 00:40:18,759
hate to give an exact number but but I

869
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:20,680
think earlier I had mentioned you know a

870
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:23,440
lot of people kind of use that range 800

871
00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:25,449
to a thousand for bloom yeah that's fair

872
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,320
I think it's important I mean I was just

873
00:40:25,449 --> 00:40:26,739
thinking about this while you were

874
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,380
talking

875
00:40:26,739 --> 00:40:30,699
you know just the addition of

876
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:34,599
supplementation of co2 will affect

877
00:40:30,699 --> 00:40:36,819
growth rates and I assume photosynthesis

878
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:39,339
rates meaning you could run probably a

879
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:42,400
higher ppfd in rooms that are controlled

880
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:44,740
with the addition of co2 and you know

881
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:47,740
proper nutrient management management

882
00:40:44,739 --> 00:40:48,099
and fertigation would come into play you

883
00:40:47,739 --> 00:40:51,699
know

884
00:40:48,099 --> 00:40:53,500
VPD which is something that i'm having

885
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:55,869
someone on to cover here real soon that

886
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:59,199
i'm excited about to talk further and

887
00:40:55,869 --> 00:41:00,849
about VPD but yes exactly that all of

888
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:02,679
these all of these factors will help

889
00:41:00,849 --> 00:41:04,210
determine your DLI and maybe it's

890
00:41:02,679 --> 00:41:05,949
important at some level to do a little

891
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:07,619
bit of experimentation in your facility

892
00:41:05,949 --> 00:41:11,739
to determine what's optimal for your

893
00:41:07,619 --> 00:41:16,380
environmental conditions yeah definitely

894
00:41:11,739 --> 00:41:16,379
great so let's talk a little bit about

895
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:22,900
determining ROI and what you're calling

896
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:23,469
TCO which was a term I had never heard

897
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:27,070
of before

898
00:41:23,469 --> 00:41:31,719
so TCO stands for total cost of

899
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:36,550
ownership and ROI calculations they can

900
00:41:31,719 --> 00:41:39,939
be very detailed and very complicated

901
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:43,510
but they can also be sort of more

902
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:46,200
general back of the envelope type

903
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:49,750
calculations just to get started so I

904
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:52,359
always recommend since I'm an engineer

905
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:54,880
at heart you know I'm always looking for

906
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:58,539
the simplest model that helps me get

907
00:41:54,880 --> 00:42:00,309
what I need so I always recommend start

908
00:41:58,539 --> 00:42:02,259
with something pretty simple for your

909
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:04,869
return on investment calculations just

910
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:08,980
see where you are ballpark wise that's

911
00:42:04,869 --> 00:42:13,900
kind of my strategy so when you're doing

912
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:16,599
an ROI comparison with LEDs versus HBS

913
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:18,789
for example you're going to you're going

914
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:21,489
to want to divide it up into a few

915
00:42:18,789 --> 00:42:26,389
different sections and

916
00:42:21,489 --> 00:42:29,179
ROI just to to remind everyone is

917
00:42:26,389 --> 00:42:31,429
basically going to be the amount of time

918
00:42:29,179 --> 00:42:35,679
it takes for the difference in upfront

919
00:42:31,429 --> 00:42:38,960
cost to equal the savings in in

920
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:41,750
operation of the lights so when that

921
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:43,880
ratio becomes identical at that time

922
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:45,889
point that's going to be when you've

923
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:48,260
reached your return on investment now

924
00:42:45,889 --> 00:42:51,679
again it can include a lot of additional

925
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:53,240
items and you should before you make a

926
00:42:51,679 --> 00:42:56,779
purchase definitely go through and

927
00:42:53,239 --> 00:42:59,059
consider all of the specifics of your

928
00:42:56,780 --> 00:43:02,620
operation to make sure that it's right

929
00:42:59,059 --> 00:43:06,559
for you but a really kind of general

930
00:43:02,619 --> 00:43:09,230
comparison would be something like you

931
00:43:06,559 --> 00:43:11,360
would take you would look at the in

932
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:13,579
order to match light levels you would

933
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:15,680
look at how many lights are required for

934
00:43:13,579 --> 00:43:18,170
the LED versus how many lights are

935
00:43:15,679 --> 00:43:20,960
required for the HBS in terms of

936
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:22,970
identical light output and you would

937
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,650
take that difference as the difference

938
00:43:22,969 --> 00:43:27,409
in upfront cost so now you have your

939
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:30,410
upfront cost difference your initial

940
00:43:27,409 --> 00:43:32,599
fixture cost difference the the second

941
00:43:30,409 --> 00:43:36,829
part of the equation which is how much

942
00:43:32,599 --> 00:43:39,110
you're saving in operational costs can

943
00:43:36,829 --> 00:43:41,599
get complicated but some of the the

944
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:46,490
major items you will need to take into

945
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:50,929
account will be how much it cost to to

946
00:43:46,489 --> 00:43:53,299
light and cool those rooms and so for

947
00:43:50,929 --> 00:43:55,969
that you would just take the amount of

948
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:58,370
wattage that goes into the number of

949
00:43:55,969 --> 00:44:01,129
fixtures that you're using and you would

950
00:43:58,369 --> 00:44:04,909
multiply that by how much you pay in

951
00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:08,360
electricity for both the HBS system and

952
00:44:04,909 --> 00:44:12,259
also the LED light system for a really

953
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:16,700
general kind of rule of thumb estimation

954
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:21,500
on the hvac what we do is we we multiply

955
00:44:16,699 --> 00:44:26,269
the wattage by a third so it's a it's a

956
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:29,119
very general way to calculate how much

957
00:44:26,269 --> 00:44:31,610
cooling you will need in the room but if

958
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:34,849
you multiply the amount of total wattage

959
00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:37,670
by one third it gives you

960
00:44:34,849 --> 00:44:41,000
of a general amount of energy or cost

961
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:43,550
associated with cooling so obviously the

962
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,889
LED light system will be less less

963
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:48,980
wattage overall and so that number is

964
00:44:45,889 --> 00:44:51,799
going to be less now it might be it

965
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:54,559
might be more weighted on the LED light

966
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:58,160
system because you do have less heat

967
00:44:54,559 --> 00:45:00,799
coming out even more even related to the

968
00:44:58,159 --> 00:45:02,539
wattage but as a very general rule

969
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:05,539
that's a good good

970
00:45:02,539 --> 00:45:08,000
calculation to run and then you need to

971
00:45:05,539 --> 00:45:11,300
consider what are the maintenance costs

972
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,670
of the of the HPS system versus the LED

973
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:15,680
light system so typically there's

974
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:18,980
there's very little maintenance cost

975
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:20,949
with LED lighting whereas with hpf you

976
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:23,480
need to calculate how much it cost to

977
00:45:20,949 --> 00:45:27,619
replace the bulbs and how much the bulbs

978
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:31,550
cost so in the end you end up with your

979
00:45:27,619 --> 00:45:34,429
operational cost per year or per month

980
00:45:31,550 --> 00:45:37,880
and however you whatever units you

981
00:45:34,429 --> 00:45:40,519
decide to use and you can then determine

982
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:42,769
how many months it takes for that

983
00:45:40,519 --> 00:45:45,110
savings and operational cost to reach

984
00:45:42,769 --> 00:45:48,679
the difference in total initial cost

985
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:50,900
that's how you would run an ROI now one

986
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:54,919
factor in all of this is you're going

987
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:58,910
through that that list was did I like to

988
00:45:54,920 --> 00:46:01,119
factor it as yield so what you would the

989
00:45:58,909 --> 00:46:04,759
calculations you gave we're assuming

990
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:06,730
identical yields across you know HPS in

991
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:08,780
this case let's say double-ended HPS

992
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:12,740
versus LEDs

993
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:14,920
I've seen some research that shows you

994
00:46:12,739 --> 00:46:18,589
know high quality LEDs can out yield

995
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:22,519
double in at HPS but what are you seeing

996
00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:26,300
in the field on this so I'm seeing some

997
00:46:22,519 --> 00:46:29,320
research that that LED can can

998
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:34,010
outperform HPS but I'm also seeing

999
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:37,610
research HPS outperforms LED so from my

1000
00:46:34,010 --> 00:46:41,420
perspective it's about light it's about

1001
00:46:37,610 --> 00:46:44,809
a broad spectrum and you know if you're

1002
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:47,329
switching from HBS to LED there there's

1003
00:46:44,809 --> 00:46:48,529
definitely going to be environmental

1004
00:46:47,329 --> 00:46:51,440
changes that can

1005
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:55,130
and that can make that switch difficult

1006
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:57,220
so a lot of aspects of those plants will

1007
00:46:55,130 --> 00:47:00,890
have to adapt they may have been

1008
00:46:57,219 --> 00:47:03,349
selected under HBS for many generations

1009
00:47:00,889 --> 00:47:06,199
so they've almost adapted to HBS

1010
00:47:03,349 --> 00:47:09,170
spectrum so there's a lot that the

1011
00:47:06,199 --> 00:47:12,199
plants might have to adapt to when you

1012
00:47:09,170 --> 00:47:16,639
switch so it might seem like switching

1013
00:47:12,199 --> 00:47:20,029
to a broad spectrum is worse for for the

1014
00:47:16,639 --> 00:47:23,480
plants for grower that's used to HBS but

1015
00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:26,540
from a scientific standpoint photons are

1016
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:28,309
photons they come into the antenna

1017
00:47:26,539 --> 00:47:30,440
system they get funneled into one

1018
00:47:28,309 --> 00:47:33,309
particular wavelength which drives the

1019
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:36,260
splitting of water so it's really not

1020
00:47:33,309 --> 00:47:40,250
and plants can absorb such a wide range

1021
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:42,740
so I think it's um it's tough to say one

1022
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:47,179
way or the other I like to just compare

1023
00:47:42,739 --> 00:47:49,579
photons to photons so if you know how

1024
00:47:47,179 --> 00:47:52,039
much light comes out what the total

1025
00:47:49,579 --> 00:47:54,829
output is of an HBS system and you're

1026
00:47:52,039 --> 00:47:58,039
doing your comparison do do an equal

1027
00:47:54,829 --> 00:48:01,119
apples apples comparison of photons in

1028
00:47:58,039 --> 00:48:04,159
both systems and figure out how many

1029
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:06,139
what would be the ROI when you compare

1030
00:48:04,159 --> 00:48:09,649
in that way that's that's been my

1031
00:48:06,139 --> 00:48:12,079
experience and that's sort of my my view

1032
00:48:09,650 --> 00:48:14,480
of it 9 I know a lot of growers will

1033
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:18,500
prefer one or the other they prefer

1034
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:23,449
maybe HPS over LEDs and and that's oh

1035
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:26,480
that's okay but there's ways to if you

1036
00:48:23,449 --> 00:48:29,419
wanted to save energy you could even you

1037
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:32,210
could even look into checkerboarding or

1038
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:34,550
replacing half of your HBS with LEDs for

1039
00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:38,420
example especially if you're offered an

1040
00:48:34,550 --> 00:48:42,260
incentive that would make that cost

1041
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:44,059
effective but there's ways to to switch

1042
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:48,290
that aren't just a complete jump from

1043
00:48:44,059 --> 00:48:51,349
HBS to LED but it's tough to say iíve

1044
00:48:48,289 --> 00:48:53,869
seen studies and papers and and case

1045
00:48:51,349 --> 00:48:57,199
studies and whitepapers both ways so I

1046
00:48:53,869 --> 00:49:00,130
think it just a lot depends on the other

1047
00:48:57,199 --> 00:49:02,189
environmental parameters the genetics

1048
00:49:00,130 --> 00:49:04,140
and

1049
00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:07,349
and and also maybe those plants have

1050
00:49:04,139 --> 00:49:11,089
been adapted to HBS for so long that

1051
00:49:07,349 --> 00:49:13,980
it's going to take a few cycles for for

1052
00:49:11,090 --> 00:49:15,630
for the plants to adapt but the growers

1053
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:18,360
to also adapt the environmental

1054
00:49:15,630 --> 00:49:20,280
conditions let's talk about that for a

1055
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:22,320
little bit that transition I think is

1056
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:25,620
really challenging it's something I was

1057
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:29,340
I was talking about recently with

1058
00:49:25,619 --> 00:49:32,549
Jennifer from your company so when I'm

1059
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:35,010
working with someone who has you know

1060
00:49:32,550 --> 00:49:37,650
double-ended HPS and and has been using

1061
00:49:35,010 --> 00:49:41,100
it for a long time and they want to

1062
00:49:37,650 --> 00:49:43,530
integrate in some of these LED solutions

1063
00:49:41,099 --> 00:49:46,079
how does that work I know you have to

1064
00:49:43,530 --> 00:49:49,019
dial back the lights I recently visited

1065
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:51,449
a facility that had I kid you not they

1066
00:49:49,019 --> 00:49:52,800
told me it was over $400,000 in LED

1067
00:49:51,449 --> 00:49:54,779
lights that were just turned off they

1068
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:57,930
were all wired in but they didn't know

1069
00:49:54,780 --> 00:50:00,930
how to use them and they had a another

1070
00:49:57,929 --> 00:50:02,969
lighting guy come in and tell them - oh

1071
00:50:00,929 --> 00:50:04,679
man you're ppfd levels are way too low

1072
00:50:02,969 --> 00:50:07,439
turn on these LED lights because they

1073
00:50:04,679 --> 00:50:09,059
had single-ended fixtures that they're

1074
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:11,030
running in that facility single-ended

1075
00:50:09,059 --> 00:50:14,250
HPS that they've been running and

1076
00:50:11,030 --> 00:50:16,260
they're ppfd levels were quite low and

1077
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:20,039
so this lighting guy told him to just

1078
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:22,230
turn on all the LED lights and so they

1079
00:50:20,039 --> 00:50:24,900
did and absolutely fried their plants

1080
00:50:22,230 --> 00:50:28,710
and I walked in I was like yeah I've

1081
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:31,019
heard that you cannot transition rapidly

1082
00:50:28,710 --> 00:50:33,210
from you know plants that are used to

1083
00:50:31,019 --> 00:50:35,090
HBS light to a higher intensity LED

1084
00:50:33,210 --> 00:50:38,280
light you have to really work it up

1085
00:50:35,090 --> 00:50:41,130
slowly so the plants can adjust so I

1086
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:43,140
guess my question is what's what's best

1087
00:50:41,130 --> 00:50:44,640
practice right now for making that

1088
00:50:43,139 --> 00:50:46,769
transition does it need to be done

1089
00:50:44,639 --> 00:50:49,199
during the vegetative cycle

1090
00:50:46,769 --> 00:50:50,880
how long do the plants need to be at a

1091
00:50:49,199 --> 00:50:54,239
lower light intensity like what should

1092
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:57,660
we be aiming for for par levels when

1093
00:50:54,239 --> 00:50:58,889
we're trying to switch plants over and

1094
00:50:57,659 --> 00:51:01,139
then you mentioned it might take a

1095
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:04,349
couple cycles what's a general range of

1096
00:51:01,139 --> 00:51:05,969
time it takes for plants to really start

1097
00:51:04,349 --> 00:51:09,569
to thrive under a different lighting

1098
00:51:05,969 --> 00:51:11,789
spectrum well I definitely you don't

1099
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:15,330
want to shock the plants when it comes

1100
00:51:11,789 --> 00:51:16,048
to when it comes to the DLI so how much

1101
00:51:15,329 --> 00:51:19,400
light the

1102
00:51:16,048 --> 00:51:23,159
are getting but also the intensity so

1103
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:25,349
I'll give you one example of of a time

1104
00:51:23,159 --> 00:51:27,868
time when plants can get really shocked

1105
00:51:25,349 --> 00:51:29,699
and that is when they go from veg to

1106
00:51:27,869 --> 00:51:32,068
flower when they're going from veg to

1107
00:51:29,699 --> 00:51:35,818
flower they're dropping their photo

1108
00:51:32,068 --> 00:51:39,568
period and that drop in photo period but

1109
00:51:35,818 --> 00:51:43,108
then oftentimes the DLI for for flower

1110
00:51:39,568 --> 00:51:45,449
is higher and so the grower will want to

1111
00:51:43,108 --> 00:51:48,058
increase the ppfd in order to match the

1112
00:51:45,449 --> 00:51:49,528
DLI with a shorter photo period so it

1113
00:51:48,059 --> 00:51:52,849
could be a pretty big shock to the

1114
00:51:49,528 --> 00:51:55,619
plants so what what we're seeing is a

1115
00:51:52,849 --> 00:51:58,349
lot of growers these days when they've

1116
00:51:55,619 --> 00:52:00,390
switched to LED they're they're taking

1117
00:51:58,349 --> 00:52:03,809
care in that initial transition state

1118
00:52:00,389 --> 00:52:06,498
stage between flower and bloom to make

1119
00:52:03,809 --> 00:52:09,390
sure that the plants aren't being

1120
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:11,848
shocked with a higher intensity light

1121
00:52:09,389 --> 00:52:14,368
for a shorter period so you can do that

1122
00:52:11,849 --> 00:52:18,079
by by running the light at a lower

1123
00:52:14,369 --> 00:52:22,019
intensity over in slightly ramping up

1124
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:24,929
also we're seeing we're seeing in large

1125
00:52:22,018 --> 00:52:27,538
operations even with LEDs you'll have a

1126
00:52:24,929 --> 00:52:30,539
heat load when the lights come on and

1127
00:52:27,539 --> 00:52:32,519
off and so for those periods sometimes

1128
00:52:30,539 --> 00:52:35,459
to the growers are ramping up in

1129
00:52:32,518 --> 00:52:38,308
intensity so that the light period is it

1130
00:52:35,458 --> 00:52:42,348
just straight on but it kind of ramps up

1131
00:52:38,309 --> 00:52:46,289
in order for HVAC to not have to be shot

1132
00:52:42,349 --> 00:52:48,809
and so that stuff those are some trends

1133
00:52:46,289 --> 00:52:51,839
that I'm seeing these days in terms of

1134
00:52:48,809 --> 00:52:54,390
switching from HPS to LED we have

1135
00:52:51,838 --> 00:52:56,788
growers that just completely make the

1136
00:52:54,389 --> 00:53:01,078
switch all across the board and do just

1137
00:52:56,789 --> 00:53:03,839
fine we we know we have growers that

1138
00:53:01,079 --> 00:53:05,489
will switch one room we know growers

1139
00:53:03,838 --> 00:53:08,608
that's which half a room and some of

1140
00:53:05,489 --> 00:53:13,559
them or some will do checkerboarding but

1141
00:53:08,608 --> 00:53:15,630
it's kind of all over the place if a

1142
00:53:13,559 --> 00:53:20,579
grower is not not used to growing with

1143
00:53:15,630 --> 00:53:22,858
with LEDs then I would say do one room

1144
00:53:20,579 --> 00:53:25,079
or a portion of the room and and just

1145
00:53:22,858 --> 00:53:28,619
just feel more comfortable see how it

1146
00:53:25,079 --> 00:53:29,760
goes and always measure light levels to

1147
00:53:28,619 --> 00:53:31,050
make sure that your

1148
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:33,750
providing the same amount of light

1149
00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:37,620
because you just want to minimize the

1150
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:39,630
shock to the plant so definitely it

1151
00:53:37,619 --> 00:53:42,420
sounds like the plants that were in that

1152
00:53:39,630 --> 00:53:45,119
in that environment that you that you

1153
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:48,960
observed they they got pretty shocked

1154
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:51,869
they didn't have time to to alter their

1155
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:53,849
biochemistry you know plants just like

1156
00:53:51,869 --> 00:53:55,710
when we when we go through a process

1157
00:53:53,849 --> 00:53:59,750
when we injure ourselves it takes a

1158
00:53:55,710 --> 00:54:02,599
while to heal or for things to work out

1159
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:07,199
plants have to adjust the number of

1160
00:54:02,599 --> 00:54:09,900
chloroplasts or the orientation of of

1161
00:54:07,199 --> 00:54:11,399
certain organelles within the

1162
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:15,030
chloroplast so all of these things can

1163
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:18,059
take time and if you if you if you

1164
00:54:15,030 --> 00:54:21,180
change conditions rapidly sometimes the

1165
00:54:18,059 --> 00:54:24,480
plant can't catch up and instead that

1166
00:54:21,179 --> 00:54:26,460
extra energy can be damaging yeah so

1167
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:28,139
what do you have a recommendation then

1168
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:30,900
like how long does it take a plant to

1169
00:54:28,139 --> 00:54:33,409
adjust you know it's cuticle oh it's

1170
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:36,090
cuticle layer you know the amount of

1171
00:54:33,409 --> 00:54:39,119
chloroplasts that has all of these

1172
00:54:36,090 --> 00:54:40,920
things so what would be a good general

1173
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:44,489
guideline and I realize this is very

1174
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:46,800
general but like if I were to be adding

1175
00:54:44,489 --> 00:54:49,459
some LED lights in a room to plants that

1176
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:52,530
had been used to being grown under HPS

1177
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:55,619
should I aim for turning down the light

1178
00:54:52,530 --> 00:54:59,040
to you know the 50% of what it normally

1179
00:54:55,619 --> 00:55:02,699
is for a few days and then I can go up

1180
00:54:59,039 --> 00:55:04,199
you know 10% a day after there are 10%

1181
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:07,710
every few days or what's what's a good

1182
00:55:04,199 --> 00:55:11,369
range for growers to aim for if they if

1183
00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:14,670
they're starting out well it's um I can

1184
00:55:11,369 --> 00:55:17,309
only really speak to what I would do and

1185
00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:21,750
since I live in Texas I don't have my

1186
00:55:17,309 --> 00:55:24,059
own grow operation not not yet but what

1187
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:26,789
I would do is I would I would start off

1188
00:55:24,059 --> 00:55:28,619
it for the transition from flowers or

1189
00:55:26,789 --> 00:55:31,829
from veg to flower I would start off at

1190
00:55:28,619 --> 00:55:36,000
50% and then I would probably wrap it up

1191
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:37,949
within that first week but it takes

1192
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,480
close observation you really want to

1193
00:55:37,949 --> 00:55:43,019
watch your plants and see how they're

1194
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:44,130
doing if that if that works just fine

1195
00:55:43,019 --> 00:55:45,780
maybe the next

1196
00:55:44,130 --> 00:55:50,550
cycle I would ramp it up a little bit

1197
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:53,160
faster but yeah you it's harder for a

1198
00:55:50,550 --> 00:55:56,250
plant that's been damaged to recover so

1199
00:55:53,159 --> 00:56:00,329
you want to try to minimize photo damage

1200
00:55:56,250 --> 00:56:03,420
and maybe aim on the slower ramp it's

1201
00:56:00,329 --> 00:56:05,789
possible are there signs that the plant

1202
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:06,059
is receiving less light than it should

1203
00:56:05,789 --> 00:56:07,579
be

1204
00:56:06,059 --> 00:56:09,599
would you typically see I know

1205
00:56:07,579 --> 00:56:14,190
stretching is something that people talk

1206
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:18,719
about where you have a greater distance

1207
00:56:14,190 --> 00:56:20,070
there but what what do you see oh sorry

1208
00:56:18,719 --> 00:56:22,879
inner no distance is what I'm referring

1209
00:56:20,070 --> 00:56:25,500
to you but what do you see for signs of

1210
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:26,940
you know less than optimal light levels

1211
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:29,610
I mean if you burn them it's very

1212
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:32,789
obvious when you put too high of light

1213
00:56:29,610 --> 00:56:35,460
intensity on a plant that's right it's

1214
00:56:32,789 --> 00:56:38,909
hard it's it's harder to measure the

1215
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:42,300
other way so the way in which do eyes

1216
00:56:38,909 --> 00:56:47,009
are generated is they are figured out

1217
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:49,380
based on optimal biomass productivity so

1218
00:56:47,010 --> 00:56:51,840
at the end of the cycle or at the end of

1219
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:54,300
the day the plant is weighed and

1220
00:56:51,840 --> 00:57:00,300
determined to know whether or not it

1221
00:56:54,300 --> 00:57:02,670
grew more or less and if it grew less at

1222
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:06,269
the lower level then it means that the

1223
00:57:02,670 --> 00:57:07,889
higher level is better so besides as you

1224
00:57:06,269 --> 00:57:12,780
mentioned stretching and internode

1225
00:57:07,889 --> 00:57:15,809
distance in terms of di calculations and

1226
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:19,920
the papers I'm that I refer to from Agra

1227
00:57:15,809 --> 00:57:22,920
extension they typically provide the

1228
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:27,480
methods they used to calculate D Li for

1229
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:30,269
different plants and usually it's leafy

1230
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:32,940
greens or vine crops but they'll explain

1231
00:57:30,269 --> 00:57:34,980
how they did the measurement so you can

1232
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:38,610
see and do those measurements yourself

1233
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:42,809
to determine the optimal D Li for for

1234
00:57:38,610 --> 00:57:44,940
your particular cultivar but yeah I

1235
00:57:42,809 --> 00:57:48,929
think you you're you're correct it's

1236
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:51,690
sort of it's hard to to know when you're

1237
00:57:48,929 --> 00:57:53,549
not providing enough light and keep in

1238
00:57:51,690 --> 00:57:55,980
mind all the other parameters that can

1239
00:57:53,550 --> 00:57:58,050
be interacting as well if those are not

1240
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:59,780
ideal or if there's too

1241
00:57:58,050 --> 00:58:02,640
I took something else that could also

1242
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:06,090
make the plants more sensitized to light

1243
00:58:02,639 --> 00:58:08,449
so you have to you have to really look

1244
00:58:06,090 --> 00:58:11,730
closely and watch your plants and and

1245
00:58:08,449 --> 00:58:14,460
and learn through repetition and trial

1246
00:58:11,730 --> 00:58:16,679
and close observation so what are you

1247
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:19,500
seeing in terms of the future of LED

1248
00:58:16,679 --> 00:58:21,329
lighting and lighting spectrum it seems

1249
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:28,110
like lighting spectrum is sort of the

1250
00:58:21,329 --> 00:58:31,139
next big I know the the great west of of

1251
00:58:28,110 --> 00:58:33,390
what where technology is headed I guess

1252
00:58:31,139 --> 00:58:36,059
what are you seeing from growers and

1253
00:58:33,389 --> 00:58:39,379
research facilities on LED lighting in

1254
00:58:36,059 --> 00:58:43,230
terms of you know far red or you know

1255
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:51,500
increasing blue or green light in you

1256
00:58:43,230 --> 00:58:55,260
know in a room so um I um so I might be

1257
00:58:51,500 --> 00:59:00,090
unpopular and I say that for overall

1258
00:58:55,260 --> 00:59:02,670
plant growth I think we've I think the

1259
00:59:00,090 --> 00:59:05,850
industry is doing a good job with with

1260
00:59:02,670 --> 00:59:08,789
different different broad spectrum

1261
00:59:05,849 --> 00:59:12,059
lighting options so I think we're

1262
00:59:08,789 --> 00:59:16,380
already doing great on the overall plant

1263
00:59:12,059 --> 00:59:19,139
growth photosynthesis side for the for

1264
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:22,230
the production of secondary metabolites

1265
00:59:19,139 --> 00:59:24,420
maybe changing profile or increasing

1266
00:59:22,230 --> 00:59:28,050
biochemistry or flux down one pathway or

1267
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:29,909
another there there could be definite

1268
00:59:28,050 --> 00:59:33,390
responses to certain wavelengths of

1269
00:59:29,909 --> 00:59:36,210
light but those could take years to

1270
00:59:33,389 --> 00:59:41,609
determine it could it will be very much

1271
00:59:36,210 --> 00:59:46,349
based on the on the gene expression of

1272
00:59:41,610 --> 00:59:49,940
that of that plant and I know just from

1273
00:59:46,349 --> 00:59:52,679
my own research that often times

1274
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:56,250
changing the environmental stimuli in

1275
00:59:52,679 --> 00:59:59,629
order to drive the production of one

1276
00:59:56,250 --> 01:00:01,349
compound or another it oftentimes has a

1277
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:04,530
detrimental effect on the overall

1278
01:00:01,349 --> 01:00:08,789
productivity of the of that organism or

1279
01:00:04,530 --> 01:00:11,519
it can result in you know shorter

1280
01:00:08,789 --> 01:00:13,829
lifespans so I think

1281
01:00:11,519 --> 01:00:15,539
you know it's going to be looking at the

1282
01:00:13,829 --> 01:00:18,090
big picture and it's going to be a lot

1283
01:00:15,539 --> 01:00:25,619
of experimentation and I would love to

1284
01:00:18,090 --> 01:00:27,960
see a lot more a lot more genetic like

1285
01:00:25,619 --> 01:00:32,190
fingerprinting and understanding more

1286
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:33,539
about how cannabis plants how they how

1287
01:00:32,190 --> 01:00:36,090
their gene expression works I think

1288
01:00:33,539 --> 01:00:39,509
there's research now just starting to be

1289
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:42,180
done on that so I think it's going to

1290
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:44,550
take a while before we figure out some

1291
01:00:42,179 --> 01:00:46,589
general rules when it comes to

1292
01:00:44,550 --> 01:00:49,730
particular wavelengths of light and how

1293
01:00:46,590 --> 01:00:52,860
that might affect profiles of different

1294
01:00:49,730 --> 01:00:58,969
compounds but in the meantime I would

1295
01:00:52,860 --> 01:01:01,829
say please experiment tries try things

1296
01:00:58,969 --> 01:01:04,909
we're not seeing ourselves we're not

1297
01:01:01,829 --> 01:01:08,480
seeing a significant amount of of

1298
01:01:04,909 --> 01:01:11,699
rigorous research or literature

1299
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:17,059
suggesting that certain UV wavelengths

1300
01:01:11,699 --> 01:01:20,429
are producing a large amount of

1301
01:01:17,059 --> 01:01:23,279
cannabinoids for example same thing with

1302
01:01:20,429 --> 01:01:26,339
infrared but that doesn't mean it's not

1303
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:28,140
true or it's not not out there I'm

1304
01:01:26,340 --> 01:01:32,220
always wanting to find that kind of

1305
01:01:28,139 --> 01:01:34,079
research so definitely definitely if you

1306
01:01:32,219 --> 01:01:36,230
can publish your results you know teach

1307
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:38,190
teach the world about this amazing

1308
01:01:36,230 --> 01:01:41,280
response that you're finding I think

1309
01:01:38,190 --> 01:01:43,980
that would be incredible but for now I

1310
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:46,050
think we're as a company as a lighting

1311
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:48,119
manufacturer we really focused on on

1312
01:01:46,050 --> 01:01:50,340
helping customers get the most out of

1313
01:01:48,119 --> 01:01:53,009
the lighting and for us that means

1314
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:56,570
giving them a solid fixture that has

1315
01:01:53,010 --> 01:02:00,030
that good efficiency and durable and so

1316
01:01:56,570 --> 01:02:01,440
and also making sure that they use the

1317
01:02:00,030 --> 01:02:03,960
appropriate amount of light that they're

1318
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:06,929
not getting too many fixtures for their

1319
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:09,420
operation and that but they're also not

1320
01:02:06,929 --> 01:02:14,309
too too little in terms of light levels

1321
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:16,800
so yeah so I write at this point I'm not

1322
01:02:14,309 --> 01:02:18,989
in the area of researching specific

1323
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:21,750
wavelengths so I can't speak to it but I

1324
01:02:18,989 --> 01:02:23,489
am on the lookout and I hope that we can

1325
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:25,050
get something out there soon in the

1326
01:02:23,489 --> 01:02:26,969
scientific community

1327
01:02:25,050 --> 01:02:29,610
and a grower community that helps us

1328
01:02:26,969 --> 01:02:32,279
know maybe where we should be going as a

1329
01:02:29,610 --> 01:02:35,880
lighting manufacturer one more thing I

1330
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:39,360
want to point out too is on the UV side

1331
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:43,099
you know I've I've been look I've looked

1332
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:46,710
into UV for LEDs for quite a while and

1333
01:02:43,099 --> 01:02:49,769
the reason is because as many other many

1334
01:02:46,710 --> 01:02:52,289
growers I want to try it I want to see

1335
01:02:49,769 --> 01:02:55,530
how it might might work and experiment

1336
01:02:52,289 --> 01:02:57,599
with it the challenge for LEDs however

1337
01:02:55,530 --> 01:03:00,690
is as I was talking earlier about

1338
01:02:57,599 --> 01:03:05,849
solid-state technology and how how life

1339
01:03:00,690 --> 01:03:10,880
emitted from a diode the the chip that

1340
01:03:05,849 --> 01:03:13,500
are that can emit light in the UV range

1341
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:17,550
are not very efficient from a

1342
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:20,550
solid-state standpoint and not only that

1343
01:03:17,550 --> 01:03:23,580
but the wavelengths that are emitted are

1344
01:03:20,550 --> 01:03:25,740
very powerful and so the primary and

1345
01:03:23,579 --> 01:03:29,039
secondary optics that are required for

1346
01:03:25,739 --> 01:03:30,839
LED chips that are in the UV range need

1347
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:33,539
to be very strong material sometimes

1348
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:35,850
like quartz and other types of really

1349
01:03:33,539 --> 01:03:39,150
strong material otherwise they they'll

1350
01:03:35,849 --> 01:03:42,750
become brittle or you'll have really

1351
01:03:39,150 --> 01:03:45,510
fast depreciation in light and so even

1352
01:03:42,750 --> 01:03:47,489
if UV is something you want to do from

1353
01:03:45,510 --> 01:03:50,580
experimental standpoint it makes sense

1354
01:03:47,489 --> 01:03:53,729
to do LEDs but I just don't see it as a

1355
01:03:50,579 --> 01:03:57,449
as an option that would make sense at

1356
01:03:53,730 --> 01:04:00,150
this point to do UV LEDs I just think

1357
01:03:57,449 --> 01:04:03,319
the technology is not quite there and

1358
01:04:00,150 --> 01:04:06,329
and there are other ways to get UV like

1359
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:09,090
lizard lamps and so on so I think if

1360
01:04:06,329 --> 01:04:11,750
somebody wanted to experiment you see

1361
01:04:09,090 --> 01:04:13,860
and find stuff that's amazing or maybe

1362
01:04:11,750 --> 01:04:15,869
maybe if they want to experiment we

1363
01:04:13,860 --> 01:04:19,980
could always make a UV LED for

1364
01:04:15,869 --> 01:04:22,319
experimental purposes but for but for

1365
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:26,490
commercial reasons we've chosen to stick

1366
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:28,470
with a really solid wide spectrum for

1367
01:04:26,489 --> 01:04:30,329
our fixtures well let's talk a little

1368
01:04:28,469 --> 01:04:32,579
bit about your company now we haven't

1369
01:04:30,329 --> 01:04:35,099
talked about BIOS really at all can you

1370
01:04:32,579 --> 01:04:37,799
tell me a little bit about what what

1371
01:04:35,099 --> 01:04:38,949
BIOS is and the types of light that you

1372
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:42,940
guys make

1373
01:04:38,949 --> 01:04:45,789
sure so BIOS lighting its headquarters

1374
01:04:42,940 --> 01:04:49,240
are in Melbourne Florida and that's

1375
01:04:45,789 --> 01:04:54,730
because several of the founders are from

1376
01:04:49,239 --> 01:04:56,979
NASA and Neil yo-yo is probably our best

1377
01:04:54,730 --> 01:04:59,349
known NASA scientist he was there for

1378
01:04:56,980 --> 01:05:04,449
over 20 years doing photo biology

1379
01:04:59,349 --> 01:05:07,420
research for for deep-space habitation

1380
01:05:04,449 --> 01:05:08,980
and he's very well known in the industry

1381
01:05:07,420 --> 01:05:13,059
in the controlled environment AG

1382
01:05:08,980 --> 01:05:15,039
industry so Neil is is there in

1383
01:05:13,059 --> 01:05:17,859
Melbourne Florida and we also have a

1384
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:20,558
team of agricultural engineers and

1385
01:05:17,858 --> 01:05:22,239
scientists there as well I'm located in

1386
01:05:20,559 --> 01:05:24,970
Austin Texas and we have sales people

1387
01:05:22,239 --> 01:05:27,519
around the country so some of the things

1388
01:05:24,969 --> 01:05:30,639
that make us different than some of the

1389
01:05:27,519 --> 01:05:33,250
other LED lighting companies are we from

1390
01:05:30,639 --> 01:05:37,868
the get-go we decided to cover the light

1391
01:05:33,250 --> 01:05:39,940
so we we use a shatterproof glass to

1392
01:05:37,869 --> 01:05:43,480
cover our lights which makes them a bit

1393
01:05:39,940 --> 01:05:46,150
heavier and it also it drops the

1394
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:48,309
efficacy a little bit from the get-go

1395
01:05:46,150 --> 01:05:51,220
because we have that cover but we

1396
01:05:48,309 --> 01:05:53,680
decided to do it because we're all kind

1397
01:05:51,219 --> 01:05:56,379
of we're all kind of nerdy we're all

1398
01:05:53,679 --> 01:05:58,929
very engineering minded and we wanted a

1399
01:05:56,380 --> 01:06:00,760
product that laughs we wanted something

1400
01:05:58,929 --> 01:06:04,179
that we could be really proud about that

1401
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:07,690
was durable commercial grade strong and

1402
01:06:04,179 --> 01:06:09,219
so we decided early on to make that that

1403
01:06:07,690 --> 01:06:11,650
product development decision that all of

1404
01:06:09,219 --> 01:06:13,629
our lights are covered so that makes us

1405
01:06:11,650 --> 01:06:15,880
different and it's a little bit of our

1406
01:06:13,630 --> 01:06:18,730
harder sell because it forces us to have

1407
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:21,338
a little bit of a lower efficacy but

1408
01:06:18,730 --> 01:06:24,670
we're still up there and we have a lot

1409
01:06:21,338 --> 01:06:29,349
of fantastic customers all across North

1410
01:06:24,670 --> 01:06:32,230
America we we have several fixtures that

1411
01:06:29,349 --> 01:06:35,200
range from a very thin panel that goes

1412
01:06:32,230 --> 01:06:38,170
into a vertical racking system which we

1413
01:06:35,199 --> 01:06:41,289
call the Icarus VI and all of our

1414
01:06:38,170 --> 01:06:43,900
fixtures are no tools required they just

1415
01:06:41,289 --> 01:06:45,670
go right in this one has a bracket that

1416
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:50,920
slides right into a pallet racking and

1417
01:06:45,670 --> 01:06:52,490
it's easy to clean and keep keep it's

1418
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:55,519
got great ingress protection

1419
01:06:52,489 --> 01:06:57,439
the glass I should mention not only does

1420
01:06:55,519 --> 01:07:00,588
it protect the electronics and make

1421
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:04,099
water proof but it also allows you to

1422
01:07:00,588 --> 01:07:05,809
clean the light so sometimes if you if I

1423
01:07:04,099 --> 01:07:08,570
mentioned earlier about light

1424
01:07:05,809 --> 01:07:11,059
degradation and if you can't wipe the

1425
01:07:08,570 --> 01:07:13,130
LEDs if they're in a potting material or

1426
01:07:11,059 --> 01:07:15,440
they're in some kind of extruded plastic

1427
01:07:13,130 --> 01:07:17,630
you can't actually clean the LEDs off

1428
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:19,820
it's hard to wipe them down so by having

1429
01:07:17,630 --> 01:07:21,470
this glass surface all of our lights are

1430
01:07:19,820 --> 01:07:24,080
easily cleaned so that you can maintain

1431
01:07:21,469 --> 01:07:28,250
the full light output that when you

1432
01:07:24,079 --> 01:07:31,608
first opened it up so we have light we

1433
01:07:28,250 --> 01:07:34,789
have fixtures that go over open bed once

1434
01:07:31,608 --> 01:07:36,739
called the icarus gi2 and by the way

1435
01:07:34,789 --> 01:07:38,719
we're engineers so we all of them are

1436
01:07:36,739 --> 01:07:43,219
called Icarus we haven't thought of a

1437
01:07:38,719 --> 01:07:46,039
new new name yet but we also have a

1438
01:07:43,219 --> 01:07:48,858
greenhouse light called the Icarus a ti

1439
01:07:46,039 --> 01:07:51,940
and that's a linear design and what's

1440
01:07:48,858 --> 01:07:55,460
unique about that is we incorporated a

1441
01:07:51,940 --> 01:07:57,800
heat pipe it's like a mini distillation

1442
01:07:55,460 --> 01:07:59,900
column along the side of the fixture

1443
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:03,019
which is an encapsulated low chain

1444
01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:06,380
alcohol continuously condensing and revé

1445
01:08:03,019 --> 01:08:08,210
a / 18 to allow for like really amazing

1446
01:08:06,380 --> 01:08:10,010
heat exchange without any moving parts

1447
01:08:08,210 --> 01:08:12,650
so we're able to have one of the

1448
01:08:10,010 --> 01:08:15,349
brightest greenhouse fixtures on the

1449
01:08:12,650 --> 01:08:18,529
market but you can touch it so that's

1450
01:08:15,349 --> 01:08:22,940
pretty amazing and then we have we have

1451
01:08:18,529 --> 01:08:27,469
bars that we call the Icarus Li and

1452
01:08:22,939 --> 01:08:29,119
those are daisy chain so there's they're

1453
01:08:27,469 --> 01:08:31,189
all selling like hotcakes I mean we

1454
01:08:29,119 --> 01:08:31,670
can't keep up it seems like but we're

1455
01:08:31,189 --> 01:08:36,318
doing great

1456
01:08:31,670 --> 01:08:38,960
but the Li are really popular in all

1457
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:41,390
types of applications a lot of vertical

1458
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:44,449
farming sometimes people are putting

1459
01:08:41,390 --> 01:08:46,910
them there they're changing the

1460
01:08:44,449 --> 01:08:49,189
orientation for inter canopy lighting

1461
01:08:46,909 --> 01:08:51,079
we're using them in between towers all

1462
01:08:49,189 --> 01:08:53,028
types of stuff can be done they're very

1463
01:08:51,079 --> 01:08:57,229
lightweight and cost-effective and so

1464
01:08:53,029 --> 01:09:00,940
those are a lot of fun and so as a

1465
01:08:57,229 --> 01:09:04,879
company we're just very focused on on

1466
01:09:00,939 --> 01:09:05,869
engineering and a lot of us have PhDs

1467
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:07,250
and and

1468
01:09:05,869 --> 01:09:10,430
they're engineering or science or both

1469
01:09:07,250 --> 01:09:12,859
and and it's just a great company to

1470
01:09:10,430 --> 01:09:16,280
work for I love it it's uh it's really

1471
01:09:12,859 --> 01:09:18,979
fun for me every day and although I work

1472
01:09:16,279 --> 01:09:21,019
out of Austin Texas I'm constantly

1473
01:09:18,979 --> 01:09:25,389
working with my team all across the

1474
01:09:21,020 --> 01:09:27,830
country and we go to a lot of shows so

1475
01:09:25,390 --> 01:09:33,590
definitely look for us at different

1476
01:09:27,829 --> 01:09:35,000
events um and yeah it's uh we've sort of

1477
01:09:33,590 --> 01:09:37,789
played on the fact that we're a little

1478
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:41,869
nerdy because we didn't do so great on

1479
01:09:37,789 --> 01:09:44,720
marketing for for a few years we were

1480
01:09:41,869 --> 01:09:47,479
really behind on the marketing and so we

1481
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:50,930
finally just owned up to it and we have

1482
01:09:47,479 --> 01:09:54,229
an ad in the cannabis Business Times

1483
01:09:50,930 --> 01:09:57,980
where I think the title says we're not

1484
01:09:54,229 --> 01:10:00,469
cool and and it really is us it's just

1485
01:09:57,979 --> 01:10:02,750
us being us like we're we're not flashy

1486
01:10:00,470 --> 01:10:05,750
we're not really like slick in that way

1487
01:10:02,750 --> 01:10:07,250
but we make a really good product yeah I

1488
01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:09,260
love the NASA connection I've just

1489
01:10:07,250 --> 01:10:11,510
always had a fascination with NASA since

1490
01:10:09,260 --> 01:10:13,579
I was a child and so I think that's

1491
01:10:11,510 --> 01:10:16,430
really cool and then I love the idea

1492
01:10:13,579 --> 01:10:17,840
that you can clean your lights people

1493
01:10:16,430 --> 01:10:19,760
are you know people are spraying stuff

1494
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:22,640
in rooms and and some of that material

1495
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:25,369
goes up and being able to keep your

1496
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:27,829
light fixtures clean at maximum

1497
01:10:25,369 --> 01:10:30,289
efficiencies I think really a huge

1498
01:10:27,829 --> 01:10:32,779
feature being waterproof like that and I

1499
01:10:30,289 --> 01:10:35,300
want to mention that we are setting up a

1500
01:10:32,779 --> 01:10:38,179
trial right now at goldleaf Gardens with

1501
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:39,860
good friends Natan been over there so

1502
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:41,570
we'll have some more data coming out

1503
01:10:39,859 --> 01:10:43,339
about these lights here soon that we

1504
01:10:41,569 --> 01:10:45,710
hope to share and Rebecca is working

1505
01:10:43,340 --> 01:10:48,590
with us on setting that up setting that

1506
01:10:45,710 --> 01:10:50,899
trial up so I'm excited for that I will

1507
01:10:48,590 --> 01:10:53,659
I need to add BIOS to our website I

1508
01:10:50,899 --> 01:10:55,429
haven't done that yet but we are we are

1509
01:10:53,659 --> 01:10:57,470
working with them to on some custom

1510
01:10:55,430 --> 01:11:00,619
lighting solutions along with fluence

1511
01:10:57,470 --> 01:11:02,900
and then when we talked about par meters

1512
01:11:00,619 --> 01:11:05,059
we do have the Sun system power meter on

1513
01:11:02,899 --> 01:11:07,960
our website I know that has some Apogee

1514
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:11,240
components but when we talk about

1515
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:13,039
top-of-the-line power meters or light

1516
01:11:11,239 --> 01:11:15,679
meters Apogee is the name that I keep

1517
01:11:13,039 --> 01:11:17,479
hearing and I'll be adding them to the

1518
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:19,119
website to you is a possibility but

1519
01:11:17,479 --> 01:11:21,399
those are all

1520
01:11:19,119 --> 01:11:22,840
what what I've found from my research to

1521
01:11:21,399 --> 01:11:25,029
be really good companies and I've heard

1522
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:27,220
great things about BIOS over the years

1523
01:11:25,029 --> 01:11:28,809
from growers who are using it and and

1524
01:11:27,220 --> 01:11:32,079
we've set up a few facilities with your

1525
01:11:28,810 --> 01:11:33,580
lights - so was there anything else you

1526
01:11:32,079 --> 01:11:34,899
wanted to add before we sign off for the

1527
01:11:33,579 --> 01:11:37,180
day I really appreciate you sort of

1528
01:11:34,899 --> 01:11:42,189

1529
01:11:37,180 --> 01:11:45,760
stuff to us it's been my pleasure I love

1530
01:11:42,189 --> 01:11:48,159
talking about this and I I've been

1531
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:50,829
putting material on the website so if

1532
01:11:48,159 --> 01:11:53,500
you want to find more we have it on our
