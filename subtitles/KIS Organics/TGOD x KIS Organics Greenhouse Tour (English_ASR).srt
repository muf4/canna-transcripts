107
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,320
gardening area just before we go into

108
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,479
the greenhouse

109
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:30,240
we're what we call our support building

110
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:31,839
so we're harvest drying processing

111
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,160
packaging shipping and receiving

112
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:35,279
a lot of hands so every employees come

113
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,840
in this facility

114
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:38,319
uh through this hallway and we have to

115
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:40,000
change

116
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:41,839
both for a region of ibm also

117
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,519
regulations so different prosthetic

118
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:46,959
patients have our stuff

119
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:48,639
uh on the cannabis and uh i'll have more

120
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:52,399
suspense and also for patients

121
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:56,000
and users um

122
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:57,198
so yeah so so so david this is a dual

123
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,040
purpose

124
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,960
concept in the fact that not only are

125
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,479
you is this regulated but it also allows

126
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:04,560
you to get out of your street clothes

127
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:06,560
and reduce the amount of pests and

128
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,720
potential pathogens that are coming into

129
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,720
the

130
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,400
okay facility we changed that get sticky

131
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:14,240
mats from the four

132
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:16,399
foot steps and some rooms and all that

133
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,800
so yeah because the

134
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:19,918
the increase of uh hem production and

135
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,919
other cannabis to

136
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:23,120
uh back east canada stated they're

137
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:25,198
really

138
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,280
present on outdoors worlds and indoor

139
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,240
growth so that's one of the first line

140
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:30,000
of effects we have

141
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,079
to make sure we're gonna drive the least

142
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
amount possible of stuff

143
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:35,599
by changing completely and we have a

144
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,639
cleaning service and coming for several

145
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,240
tracks for us

146
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,680
and send them backs and it's both from

147
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,439
the ibm

148
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,959
purpose but also for compliance with the

149
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:44,800
health canada which is

150
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:46,719
lifelike us by sending us to produce

151
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,520
legal cannabis in canada for medical and

152
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,360
recreation

153
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:51,519
so the products and channels are the

154
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,439
same but to whom we sell at the end will

155
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:55,120
be different so for medical station

156
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:57,120
we'll ship directly

157
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,240
to their personal address and for

158
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,160
recreational we will

159
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:05,439

161
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:08,560
so yeah we have a lot of staff going on

162
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:10,719
right now today

163
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,399

to show you a little bit of everything

167
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:20,879
okay great david uh there is a request

168
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,720
on the uh

169
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:24,240
q a that you speak a little bit louder

170
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,800
it's a little bit more background noise

171
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,280
so just

172
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,560
for future questions if you could try

173
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:29,839
and do that but let's go ahead and move

174
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,519
on

175
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:33,279
thank you for letting us know awesome

176
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:34,959
and bear with us a little bit of

177
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:36,559
connection issues but uh

178
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:38,000
keep reminding me of that please and

179
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,439
i'll do my best to

180
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,439
repeat or anything so we'll we can take

181
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:42,959
our time for the tour today guys so uh

182
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:44,639
make sure that everybody's getting all

183
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:49,839
the information and

184
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,840
uh views that they want

185
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,759
okay great so now we're just heading

186
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:59,038
down i believe to the mother room

187
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:01,199
and uh everyone should be able to

188
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:02,399
hear us okay and we have talked to david

189
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,680
about speaking a little louder so you

190
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:05,679
guys should all be hearing that

191
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,199
you may need to turn up the speakers on

192
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,560
your uh

193
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,560
your computer or your phone just

194
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,000
slightly um because there is a little

195
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:17,839
bit of background noise so

196
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,839
we will do our best here and

197
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:31,839
um

198
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:44,079
i hope you guys can hear me all the way

199
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,360
to the greenhouse

200
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:47,120
we've got several different things that

201
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,038
are happening here today department

202
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,519
there's a lot of cleaning tools

203
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:54,878
but we're going to go where our clothing

204
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:54,878
and genetic bank is

205
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,839
[Music]

206
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:59,839
uh

207
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,918
and just to remind you guys we will get

208
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,680
some freezing on the video as we move

209
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:19,598
from room to room so we just have to be

210
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,598
patient for the wi-fi to reconnect

211
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:29,439
there

212
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,439
okay guys i think i think we should be

213
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,759
good for wi-fi now i'll just wait for

214
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:34,958
your

215
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:40,719
confirmation class but

216
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:42,879
we are now in some other room

217
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,320
oh david there was a there was a quick

218
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:44,958
question someone asked if there was that

219
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,440
was a uv

220
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:48,479
light on the wall that we walked past i

221
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,440
missed it but when we were in the

222
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,278
hallway do you know what they're

223
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,959
referencing

224
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:55,360
uh yeah i think those one are just

225
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:56,958
little uh regular fly hatching like not

226
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,560
necessarily uv but you got the same

227
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:00,719
light and restaurants and kitchens

228
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:02,159
it's just to attract a little bug that's

229
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,320
may add them there

230
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:05,439
so it's just a good general sanitation

231
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,160
program on the sunny

232
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,000
on the processing side of the village so

233
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:12,719
it's not necessarily for a

234
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
specific existing candidate's idea but

235
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,120
it's just good

236
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,120
educational practices

237
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,919
okay the connection here is is okay is

238
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:26,319
there somewhere else in the room where

239
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:29,599
it might be slightly better if you move

240
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,760
over or no uh i i think we can

241
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,360
try to go down the aisle a little bit it

242
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:37,838
might be the room

243
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,839
okay all right

244
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,679
super awesome custom-designed

245
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,560
controlling fence for a large volume of

246
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:48,079
soil

247
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:51,838
that's one of the innovations that we

248
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,839
did here that is

249
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:08,538
you know

250
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:08,538
[Music]

251
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:11,919
we'll do our best with that and we'll

252
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:12,479
move to a different room if it gets too

253
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:15,120
chubby

254
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,399
every rooms are designed the same way uh

255
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,639
this room is a bit more

256
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,879
quieter than the others but also a bit

257
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:23,278
smaller because

258
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:23,278
our mother

259
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,360
so david how many different uh cultivars

260
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:32,319
do you have approximately

261
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,720
in your mother room i think right now

262
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,720
we're

263
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:38,000
about 25-ish we're not flowering them

264
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,360
all there's about eight

265
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,120
uh that we are flowering uh and uh

266
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,200
on the rotation there's others that were

267
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,959
test uh flowering there's stuff that we

268
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,360
used to grow and we just keep

269
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:50,159
one or two plants we have there genetics

270
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,278
uh

271
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:56,319
gene pool for either breeding or for uh

272
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:59,679
bringing back later uh but

273
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,680
i know i think we have

274
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:03,599
one of our cbd hotels here on this side

275
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:04,879
this is charlotte angel and this is uh

276
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:09,040
rockstar tuna

277
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:11,519
uh okay great and then

278
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:13,599
you mentioned uh you mentioned the

279
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,519
amount of soil that you have there so

280
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,480
how are you managing the soil in your

281
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:20,159
mother room for these mother plants

282
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,480
it's pretty much the same thing as we do

283
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:22,480
before

284
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,240
playing it safe right now we're learning

285
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:27,439
how to use we've only been growing this

286
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,159
greenhouse since uh

287
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,880
last october so it's not been a fully a

288
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:33,519
year for

289
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:35,200
us yet uh so we're learning still but uh

290
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,600
so far that this comes in here for a

291
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,000
year

292
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,399
it's doing very well uh we have a lot of

293
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,958
good rooms as well and even in uh solids

294
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,120
and

295
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:44,159
older and subdressed several several

296
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,839
times so

297
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:47,600
for the mother room so far we're going

298
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:50,800
to keep on our ears for four to

299
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,959
six months we kept them from longer uh

300
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:53,919
and we replaced them but we kept a few

301
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:55,838
of the older mom

302
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:58,319
or a few moms that got really big we

303
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:59,680
literally cut it down completely to see

304
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,399
how it would regrow

305
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:03,359
and it's growing growing back very well

306
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,440
and uh

307
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,360
even some of the moms that we remove and

308
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,480
i don't know just give you an example

309
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,800
here if you want to look down in this

310
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,120
there used to be a smaller mother there

311
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:17,519
and now the

312
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,399
the roots of this mother is a bit older

313
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,600
they're uh

314
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:23,600
starts colonizing the old triangles this

315
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,240
crop could be good for a tree to form

316
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,680
others

317
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,430
when there is just one of their solar

318
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:28,399
system

319
00:12:26,429 --> 00:12:30,239
[Music]

320
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,159
and we have a lot of turnover of organic

321
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,959
matters still through a lot of a

322
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:37,039
composting or a meeting and uh exterior

323
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:38,078
requires a lot of enzymes it breaks old

324
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:39,759
organic matter

325
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:41,519
so the only thing that we really have to

326
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:43,439
do with our soil here is to

327
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,519
top it up because it kind of shrinks

328
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,320
with all the microbial activity

329
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,759
and so right now we have a cloud that

330
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,879
went above the greenhouse so the light

331
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:53,439
sensors

332
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:55,039
i adjusting the setup level that we see

333
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,360
in there so they just went off and went

334
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:57,519
back

335
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,639
up so it's a bit of a cloudy day today

336
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,639
so far they're rolling over and

337
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,399
indicating that well as a real-time

338
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,919
uh adjustment of the lines you didn't

339
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,720
see no freedom

340
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:08,479
so so david how about this just because

341
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,360
the connection in this room is not quite

342
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,519
as good

343
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,600
uh can we move on to the next room and

344
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,120
then uh possibly i wanted to ask you

345
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,879
some of these other questions

346
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,078
in the that people have in the other

347
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,679
room where we might have a little better

348
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:20,879
connection

349
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:23,039
yeah well we're going to go for that

350
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:26,799
we're going to go in a room that just

351
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:28,078
started early i'm going to get the unit

352
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:29,679
just so i walk through the hallway

353
00:13:28,078 --> 00:13:31,439
because it's a bit noisy and i'm going

354
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:35,838
to

355
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,839
be back about a minute

356
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,440
so while david's muted here uh for those

357
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:43,278
of you

358
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,480
if you can still hear me uh i just want

359
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:45,439
to mention what he was saying there

360
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,440
regarding the

361
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,040
lighting was when the cloud came over

362
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,839
then the lights come

363
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:53,120
on to add supplemental light to maintain

364
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,279
the par levels at

365
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,879
optimal levels for the plants that

366
00:13:55,278 --> 00:13:58,480
they've set so they can control

367
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:00,240
all that with the greenhouse lighting

368
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,920
which is which is pretty cool

369
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,759
and i happen to just know that they're

370
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:05,679
using fluence lighting

371
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:06,958
uh in the greenhouse i don't know who

372
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:09,278
the manufacturer is

373
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:10,719
on those uh rolling benches but david

374
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:11,278
can answer that when we get to the other

375
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,879
room

376
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:16,240
as well as the greenhouse manufacturer

377
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:18,078
so why don't you tackle those two

378
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:31,839
questions when we get there david

379
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:31,838
and we'll go from there cool

380
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:41,839
[Music]

381
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:41,838
good back done i just

382
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:59,838
yeah just just be really loud yeah i'll

383
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:59,839
try to be uh

384
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,480
so right now we're in a room where we're

385
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:06,078
growing uh i think it's gorilla glue

386
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,039
number four in here

387
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:09,599
uh those plants got slipped into flour

388
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:13,198
about

389
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:16,959
five days ago or roughly a week ago

390
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:18,719
and then let the lights put on on a bit

391
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:20,239
of a cloudy day there's a forecasting

392
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,519
thunderstorm here this afternoon the

393
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,879
clouds get pretty dark

394
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,399
it looks like we're almost getting into

395
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:26,240
the evening kind of light setting so the

396
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,240
lights are kicking on right now and you

397
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,000
were right there those are like a fluent

398
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,600
uh bio engineering lights

399
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,440
working with fluids for several years

400
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,278
they've been enough to partner with them

401
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,880
uh the quality of their light as far as

402
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:38,639
the spectrum goes really good

403
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:40,078
through the efficiency it's awesome for

404
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,680
a full of life

405
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:43,838
but a big part of it with the the

406
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:46,078
customer services and the furnishings

407
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:49,040
where i was able to offer us it was

408
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:49,838
really really awesome to work with and

409
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:53,039
uh

410
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:56,639
they made a custom produce for us

411
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:58,639
which is uh uh kind of a saddle that

412
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,759
amounts of existing structuring frame of

413
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,519
the greenhouse so

414
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,519
you can see that there's two lights side

415
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,519
by side it's kind of a custom product

416
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:09,039
that is that we get up with them

417
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,039
the same way that we give up those

418
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,360
been in the greenhouse business for over

419
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:18,000
uh 60 years in the netherlands i believe

420
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:20,159
and uh the greenhouse manufacturer in

421
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,759
the set itself is kubo it's a kuvo

422
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:24,078
burrito so

423
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,600
this greenhouse is very unique and the

424
00:16:24,078 --> 00:16:27,359
amount of technologies and

425
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,600
data points that we can get on that but

426
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,600
also it is just a general

427
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,278
uh design phase so we have a fully

428
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,800
sealed green island here so

429
00:16:33,278 --> 00:16:36,480
typical greenhouse what you guys are

430
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:40,240
going to see usually together there's

431
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:42,720
vents on top or vents on the sides uh

432
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,480
in this kind of like a little greenhouse

433
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,759
if it grows and rows of greenhouse

434
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,320
you're gonna see air movement

435
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:50,560
from the top and from the end uh this

436
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,199
basically our warehouse with a glass

437
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:53,919
roof

438
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:55,599
we cannot open the sides or roof ducts

439
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:57,679
so we have a

440
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,720
giant hvac system that you can see in

441
00:16:57,679 --> 00:17:02,078
the back those

442
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:04,640
cabinet looking thing in the back maybe

443
00:17:02,078 --> 00:17:06,078
trying to get closer at some point uh

444
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,759
but those are uh

445
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:12,480
giant hvac systems i think you gotta

446
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:13,838
i can't remember how many tons of asics

447
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,838
but uh

448
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:18,639
uh it works and uh that's the most uh

449
00:17:16,838 --> 00:17:19,438
amazing i know what has been surprising

450
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:23,839
but like

451
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,839
uh and uh

452
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:27,839
all the stuff something that the real

453
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,480
greenhouse uh over

454
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:31,119
50 years never failed to green off like

455
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,319
this

456
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:34,399
it's always been kind of standing

457
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:37,359
quality but a fully closed one

458
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,919
uh the first one uh and it's working so

459
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:39,839
far

460
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,160
so in the greenhouse industry generally

461
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:44,639
in the summer you're going to apply some

462
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,519
products to reduce the amount of heat in

463
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,640
your out

464
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:50,160
uh some uh people people are calling

465
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,679
climbing the greenhouse putting cool

466
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,038
white or rid of these regular sun

467
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,600
there's a bunch of different products

468
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:56,558
out there

469
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:57,759
so basically plus the slice just come

470
00:17:56,558 --> 00:18:01,119
into your greenhouse

471
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:04,319
and reduce the heat but uh

472
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:06,239
also bring some light this year uh

473
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:07,918
i think i called off the other custard

474
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,120
just before they came to spring arena

475
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,799
because we thought we could get away

476
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:13,279
without it and

477
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:14,319
we've gone through uh the worst parts of

478
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:17,839
summer as far as

479
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:19,759
humidity goes for us here in uh ontario

480
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:21,678
uh we're just sort of niagara for people

481
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:23,519
who don't exactly know where we are

482
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,360
uh basically between toronto and niagara

483
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:27,200
by lake ontario

484
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:28,479
and it's very hot in humid summer but we

485
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,038
were able to

486
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,400
get away without having to reduce your

487
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:33,200
light levels in the greenhouse just

488
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,200
using

489
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,558
the cooling capacity that's built into

490
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,759
the greenhouse and it's been

491
00:18:36,558 --> 00:18:41,678
amazing so i held up the helicopter half

492
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:44,480
an hour before it came

493
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:47,600
but until that i did we have an amazing

494
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:50,558
light level in greenhouse wildlife

495
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:51,439
college here uh we have uh chelsea on

496
00:18:50,558 --> 00:18:54,960
the camera we have

497
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:56,480
casey one of our climate control guys

498
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,919
working with prima

499
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:01,200
control system i believe we're about 27

500
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:04,799
degrees

501
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:09,200
uh in this greenhouse 28 right now

502
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:09,200
and it's very very comfortable

503
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,480
the other very interesting thing about

504
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,240
this greenhouse that is that uh

505
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,480
the weight of the air is other reasons

506
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,200
that work whatever living falls through

507
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,640
it

508
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:26,319
i'm just gonna their air gets comes in

509
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,960
from the back of the green out

510
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:30,798
there um either from outside and then it

511
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,279
gets full you can condition

512
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:34,319
proper relative humidity temperature and

513
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:36,000
velocity

514
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:38,159
and then we're going to pull it through

515
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,880
the canopy from underneath

516
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,798
we have those big inflated balloon uh we

517
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,120
call them slurp because it's the thing

518
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:47,119
that the dust guys are using for them

519
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:48,719
uh which basically they're incorporated

520
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:51,199
big line

521
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,519
and they blow hair from underneath the

522
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:56,160
cold air through the canopy

523
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:57,599
so we really manage the microclimate

524
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,480
inside of our canopy

525
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:00,480
and frost climate

526
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,319
but i bet if you want to make a messy

527
00:20:02,558 --> 00:20:06,798
turn out of it for me

528
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:08,079
instead of having one giant bed in

529
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:11,279
between

530
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:13,119
a bit of an airflow and then a little

531
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:14,639
bit of leaf wrestling here

532
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:16,959
you know that until the airflow's really

533
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,960
moving

534
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:24,558
so so david is the reason for the bed

535
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:26,079
shape because of this unique airflow

536
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:27,440
system that you're trying to do to get

537
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:29,839
the air in coming up

538
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,558
through the canopy from the bottom up

539
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:33,439
yeah we've

540
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:34,798
well it breaches to design our larger

541
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,640
bed if you go with

542
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:38,720
four feet bed with the amount of

543
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,000
transpiration the amount of water we get

544
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,200
is the middle of the bed

545
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,759
so which would be the uh feet

546
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,400
in uh you don't get so much little

547
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:48,158
compartment

548
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,840
in a lot of molds and some bugs and a

549
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:52,080
lot of uh

550
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:53,599
bridges like that so you have to grow

551
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:56,000
the plants a bit taller

552
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:57,359
bring them harder so it's a bit of a mix

553
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,400
of different reasons

554
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:04,000
from uh managing the plants the

555
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,640
ipm the workflow s time set that gave

556
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,400
rise to

557
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,400
this solution and it's been working

558
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,519
beautifully

559
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:13,120
so so the connection's a little bit

560
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:14,480
choppy so i just want to make sure i

561
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:14,959
understood that correctly so you're

562
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,279
running

563
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,200
this shape and depth and size of beds

564
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:21,279
because it allows for the airflow

565
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,840
it allows you to work in between the

566
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:26,319
rows and manage the beds and it also

567
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:27,359
limits uh mold and mildew pockets that

568
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:30,000
you may experience

569
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:32,158
in a wider bed is that all correct

570
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,079
exactly so if i'm going to ask

571
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,280
how to just show them if you can just

572
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:37,199
show the entire

573
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:39,599
so you can see that the leaves are kind

574
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:42,558
of rustling in there in this area

575
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:43,038
if this was a solid piece here and there

576
00:21:42,558 --> 00:21:44,798
we won't

577
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:46,558
get air flow on the side of the bed and

578
00:21:44,798 --> 00:21:47,599
we would have a micro climate that would

579
00:21:46,558 --> 00:21:50,798
form in here

580
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:51,359
and that would be aggressive for ibm and

581
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:54,400
uh

582
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:56,959
and also flight quality

583
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,400
and then uh david i want to ask you

584
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,919
about co2 levels

585
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,320
what are you running in these rooms and

586
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:05,679
how are you managing that

587
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:07,038
so for a co2 level it has a lot to do

588
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,919
with

589
00:22:07,038 --> 00:22:10,480
the amount of light that we're getting

590
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,320
so

591
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,480
if we're solely on natural light there's

592
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:15,918
a level for that we're adding uh we're

593
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,079
trying to follow the

594
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:20,080
uh light saturation service and match

595
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:22,879
your suit with that so basically

596
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:22,879
depending on how

597
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:27,119
bright it is we're going to add the

598
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,880
proper amount of students for that

599
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:31,038
it's a bit of a fine-tuning process but

600
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,520
we took a simple approach that occurred

601
00:22:31,038 --> 00:22:33,279
so

602
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:34,879
we changed it throughout the week so as

603
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:37,599
far as the plants are growing

604
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,360
uh but basically we have the opportunity

605
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:41,918
to go from anywhere from uh

606
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:42,879
ambien where mds co2 level is a little

607
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,280
bit higher

608
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:47,280
uh than normal because of resources

609
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:50,158
roughly 500 50

610
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:52,799
depending how much we uh recirculate

611
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:54,640
otherwise we can go all the way to 1500

612
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:57,119
[Music]

613
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,400
but getting at those levels they're uh

614
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:00,239
depending on the air

615
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,600
you have to get into uh more

616
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,120
recirculation modes

617
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:05,279
of the air because if you're flushing

618
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:07,439
your alzheimer's it's about a few

619
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:08,960
huge levels of volume in this room the

620
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,720
interesting part of the future is that

621
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,840
it gets injected and those slurps are

622
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,159
below the table

623
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:15,678
so we deliver it through the canopy as

624
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,320
well

625
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:18,880
so just to finish on the air uh movement

626
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:21,359
system

627
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,320
here's that so once air goes through the

628
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:24,399
canopy with

629
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:25,678
enriched skewed units there's two things

630
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,840
that can happen to it

631
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,919
we either can't recirculate it so we're

632
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:32,639
gonna same thing as a fully

633
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:34,080
closed indoor garden so we circulate

634
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:37,520
here in the room or we can

635
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:40,399
access it through our

636
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:41,278
giant exhaust line in there and there's

637
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,960
a

638
00:23:41,278 --> 00:23:45,679
bunch of charcoal filter there so we

639
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:48,079
don't really smell anything outside

640
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:48,880
so it can be a fully steel greenhouse

641
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:51,038
garden

642
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,799
or we can exhaust by forcing air for the

643
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:53,839
canopy and get rid of humidity or high

644
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:54,960
temperature

645
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:56,558
when there's something critical

646
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,759
happening we can have an air cooler and

647
00:23:56,558 --> 00:24:01,200
change this greenhouse

648
00:23:57,759 --> 00:24:02,720
every five minutes great

649
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,480
great so i want to highlight a couple

650
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,600
things because like i said the sound is

651
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,759
a little bit off one

652
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:08,719
taylor kirk asked about the helicopter

653
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:10,960
comment and

654
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,798
basically what you were saying there was

655
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,400
you have a helicopter that would come in

656
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:16,960
right before the hottest times of the

657
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,960
year to spray

658
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,120
a coating over the top of the greenhouse

659
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,200
if i understood you correctly to reduce

660
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:24,558
the amount of heat in the greenhouse and

661
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,240
you called it off because

662
00:24:24,558 --> 00:24:28,319
this year you were able to manage it

663
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,720
effectively through

664
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:34,480
uh your air conditioning and airflow in

665
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:38,720
that system is that is that correct

666
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:40,558
uh in greenhouse too uh

667
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,400
usually we use a helicopter because the

668
00:24:40,558 --> 00:24:45,519
greenhouses are too big there's like a

669
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:47,679
nectar and a half here under

670
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:49,278
uh one of my first job when i was a kid

671
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:52,080
was playing the greenhouse

672
00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:53,519
with a like a internet i really like the

673
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:55,599
other capture now it's plus better

674
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:58,240
solution so it's just basically a

675
00:24:55,599 --> 00:25:00,158
coating of uh commercially available

676
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,919
products that will let the good total

677
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:02,480
systemic active range of the light go

678
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:05,919
through

679
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,640
it will bounce back uh more uh infrared

680
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,159
light

681
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,919
to reduce the amount of infrared that

682
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:13,200
will warm up the greenhouse but

683
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:15,200
you reduce uh from about 15 to

684
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,558
percent of your natural life depending

685
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,720
on how fixed you make

686
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:18,720
uh

687
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,599
okay well thanks david and uh i wanted

688
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,440
to go back i'm trying to get as many of

689
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:27,839
these questions in as i can

690
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:31,679
uh our good friend jaya palmer was

691
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:33,359
asking if that was a bean plant

692
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:35,120
he was asking yeah that was a beauty

693
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:37,599
plant we saw in the mother room

694
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:39,278
and uh what the purpose another person

695
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:41,759
asked if that was for spider mites can

696
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:43,759
you just touch on that really quickly

697
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:47,359
that's exactly what it is

698
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:49,359
for uh we got one over there

699
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:50,479
it's not a very happy looking one but

700
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:52,158
let's uh

701
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,400
we put those plants in there if they're

702
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:55,278
a little indicator plant so spider mites

703
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,240
will go

704
00:25:55,278 --> 00:25:58,640
on those bush being planned first and

705
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,000
they

706
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,480
are actually if we see spider mites on

707
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,640
those

708
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,519
really we know that we need to increase

709
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,440
the amount of

710
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:09,119
beneficial insects that we have to grow

711
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,600
to manage and

712
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:12,479
spending vitamin so far we've never seen

713
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:14,798
that here

714
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,400
uh so it's been really good for us uh

715
00:26:14,798 --> 00:26:17,759
and uh yeah it's just a bit of an

716
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:21,038
indicator plan

717
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:25,038
uh and uh yes

718
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:27,759
leaders push me find the symptoms

719
00:26:25,038 --> 00:26:28,400
wonderful and then the yellow tape i

720
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:31,679
assume

721
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:33,919
is yellow sticky tape to catch flying

722
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:37,038
insects and pests in the room

723
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:39,840
this is referred to in the ibm world

724
00:26:37,038 --> 00:26:41,440
so basically this is my insect from

725
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:45,119
fungus mass to

726
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:48,880
flying in to uh just regular

727
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:52,719
uh outside stuff and chris dude

728
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:55,460
do prefer to move on but we're

729
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,558
just going with those we're still uh

730
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:58,159
[Music]

731
00:26:56,558 --> 00:27:07,839
doing our best and with the minnesota

732
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:07,840
part of the work organization

733
00:27:16,619 --> 00:27:21,278
[Music]

734
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:22,480
yeah so uh very good so mass trapping

735
00:27:21,278 --> 00:27:23,759
that makes a lot of sense you're just

736
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,399
trying to catch as many as you can it's

737
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:26,240
not so much

738
00:27:24,398 --> 00:27:28,000
as a scouting tool because you're not

739
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,079
changing them out frequently

740
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,278
but uh i assume you're doing separate

741
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:34,319
scouting then

742
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:35,519
on a regular basis that's which is very

743
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:39,119
important

744
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:40,879
yeah cool moving on start sleep

745
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:44,239
and stay clean and you can only do that

746
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,240
from personality

747
00:27:45,679 --> 00:28:03,840
william cowell was asking how often does

748
00:27:47,679 --> 00:28:03,840
the soil need to be changed

749
00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:12,740
[Music]

750
00:28:16,299 --> 00:28:24,240
[Music]

751
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,278
so you have the ability to change the

752
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:46,559
soil if you need to because those are

753
00:28:45,278 --> 00:28:49,278
manageable sized

754
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:50,720
containers on that road however the plan

755
00:28:49,278 --> 00:28:53,440
is to never

756
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,798
change the soil unless you absolutely

757
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,200
have to but rather to

758
00:28:54,798 --> 00:28:58,798
manage the soil fertility through adding

759
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:02,000
in various amendments

760
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:04,240
organic matter over time as the soil is

761
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,159
going to continue to improve

762
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,759
uh through you know improving the soil

763
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:08,960
ecology is essentially what you're what

764
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:12,240
you're saying

765
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:14,640
yeah exactly

766
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,759
disease sometimes a little bit but we

767
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,880
have such a

768
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:19,679
competitive thing right this philia uh i

769
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,159
don't know

770
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:23,120
uh a little bit the one length perfect

771
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:24,960
here and there

772
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:26,719
it doesn't spread out to the rest to

773
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,558
grow uh

774
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,240
we use a lot of products like root

775
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:33,599
shields next to us

776
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:35,120
early on and all that uh

777
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:37,839
at this scale we don't expect it's

778
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:40,959
completely perfect but like we're really

779
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:40,959
happy with where things

780
00:29:47,099 --> 00:29:54,000
[Music]

781
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:56,159
he's going to show you uh listing system

782
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,159
and we have the greenhouse there's a

783
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:00,240
pretty high-end and uh the first time

784
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:02,640
we've decided it's really awesome

785
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,558
so we can basically turn this entire

786
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:08,240
room into a cloud of

787
00:30:04,558 --> 00:30:10,398
fog if you want to

788
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,440
it's really good for us when we're uh

789
00:30:10,398 --> 00:30:14,158
trench cleansing

790
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,200
or when we want to add an advanced level

791
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:17,278
but we have this like

792
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,558
super beautiful high performance and it

793
00:30:17,278 --> 00:30:20,480
looks to look like

794
00:30:18,558 --> 00:30:23,359
uh the mist things that you're gonna see

795
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:25,919
some of the grocery store produce aisle

796
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:28,719
very very fine and uh it's been working

797
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:28,720
wonders bro

798
00:30:28,798 --> 00:30:32,158
that's really cool that's a really cool

799
00:30:30,398 --> 00:30:35,359
feature so uh

800
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:36,290
ben asked how are you dehumidifying by

801
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:37,678
venting only

802
00:30:36,289 --> 00:30:41,119
[Music]

803
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:44,159
so the dnp station uh we have used

804
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:46,158
aviation dramatically in our hvac system

805
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:48,080
but it's going to be depending on how

806
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:50,159
much fuel we are running

807
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:51,918
what's the outside temperature how much

808
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:54,960
like green damage

809
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:57,440
capacity do i get from outside

810
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,319
uh depending if if it's winter because

811
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,000
cold uh

812
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:01,759
air outside it all we have to warm up

813
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,919
this air in dry air

814
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:05,599
and then it's radioactive so the

815
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:06,399
strategy for summer and winter is

816
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:08,959
different

817
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:11,278
but it's based on west coast high

818
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:13,600
temperature

819
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:14,480
because if you flush it all the air uh

820
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:17,199
if you're pushing out our

821
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,720
suits it also means that sometimes we

822
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,919
get to have uh

823
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:24,798
80 percent of new air and really 20

824
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:25,919
we're here a bunch of stations this is

825
00:31:24,798 --> 00:31:28,000
where

826
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:29,120
software products are somewhere like

827
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,038
three of us that are

828
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:32,558
gonna get built from a private

829
00:31:31,038 --> 00:31:34,798
controlled point of view but also

830
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:36,158
an energy illustration when you use an

831
00:31:34,798 --> 00:31:39,679
entertainment agreement

832
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:42,640
with synthetic stuff with labor so we

833
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:44,559
basically humidity knows how much you

834
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:47,919
need you can make aware of the

835
00:31:44,558 --> 00:31:49,918
dry air control can be expended our unit

836
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:51,038
electricity while we get it for free

837
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:53,600
from outside over

838
00:31:51,038 --> 00:31:56,000
certain place and what does it trust us

839
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:58,319
as far as you can go

840
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,880
so when we're in the early veterans room

841
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:00,879
we said we

842
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:12,239
very cool well david i have some more

843
00:32:10,798 --> 00:32:14,480
questions for you but why don't we

844
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,798
tackle them in the next space

845
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,919
if we want to keep this moving along

846
00:32:16,798 --> 00:32:19,038
yeah uh

847
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:21,519
you guys been able to you know

848
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:23,599
distinguish them a little bit and uh

849
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:25,200
yes it is it is coming through you can't

850
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:25,678
see that that's very cool that you have

851
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,840
that

852
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:29,840
that ability um

853
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,640
and so basically you know while we're

854
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:38,240
switching i can do some talking

855
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:40,640
but uh what what you're sharing with us

856
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:42,558
is essentially that uh you're using a

857
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,080
chart when you talk about humidity and

858
00:32:42,558 --> 00:32:44,879
temperature in that relationship you're

859
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:48,398
looking at the

860
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:51,039
vapor uh vapor pressure differential so

861
00:32:48,398 --> 00:32:52,158
they're relative to each other so you're

862
00:32:51,038 --> 00:32:53,759
managing that

863
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:55,760
you know when you say you're talking

864
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:57,278
about where how that outside air gets

865
00:32:55,759 --> 00:32:59,679
you know conditioned or prepped before

866
00:32:57,278 --> 00:33:01,200
coming into the greenhouse and also

867
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:03,519
looking at how

868
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,880
uh you're managing the air in the space

869
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:06,798
and choosing to vent

870
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:09,360
you essentially have complete control

871
00:33:06,798 --> 00:33:11,200
over all of those aspects

872
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:12,639
uh when we're talking about air and

873
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,798
that's all related to the

874
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,679
the temperature that you're uh you're

875
00:33:14,798 --> 00:33:17,839
dealing with so

876
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:19,120
i just kind of wanted to highlight that

877
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:21,119
a little bit

878
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:23,599
um it looks like we're frozen here right

879
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:23,918
now as we're switching over to the next

880
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:25,759
uh

881
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:28,000
wi-fi section but hopefully we'll be

882
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:30,720
back on soon

883
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,159
um assuming you can hear me while we're

884
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,720
making this switch

885
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:37,200
uh for everybody uh david there are some

886
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:40,399
great questions people are asking

887
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:42,080
um it looks like you're you're slowly

888
00:33:40,398 --> 00:33:44,479
coming back on here can you can you hear

889
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:44,480
me david

890
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:53,839
like you're still a little bit choppy

891
00:33:50,839 --> 00:33:53,839
here

892
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:01,200
oh david hold on your uh your video

893
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:01,199
hasn't quite caught up yet

894
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:07,839
i think we're back you're back right now

895
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:07,839
okay

896
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:13,759
yeah so uh i heard your comments about

897
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,760
epd

898
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:18,000
tv a little bit louder david sorry to

899
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,320
interrupt

900
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,679
yeah yeah so we're uh we're managing the

901
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,440
vpd like you explained

902
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:25,119
what the mystics have done and you have

903
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,599
out of an air refresh and everything

904
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:27,599
that we have

905
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:34,000
ranked again and then depending on our

906
00:34:30,398 --> 00:34:35,279
energy strategy

907
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,199
least amount of energy to be as

908
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,079
efficient as you get in here operation

909
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:40,078
costs but also

910
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:42,560
it's just good things that you use in

911
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:42,560
switzerland

912
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:48,960
you have a lot of flexibility in green

913
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:48,959
and this is what's

914
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:57,759
so what room are we in right now david

915
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,760
an executive room

916
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:04,800
in here right now we have about

917
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,320
four thousand types of red times here so

918
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,160
we'll show you some above a little bit

919
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:11,760
so you get an idea of uh

920
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:15,199
what it looks like and uh

921
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:16,000
yeah so right now we're about to say 18

922
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:18,879
to 21

923
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,880
flowering in here

924
00:35:19,358 --> 00:35:23,838
okay so you're you said there's 4 500

925
00:35:21,358 --> 00:35:24,400
plants and you're around day 18 in

926
00:35:23,838 --> 00:35:29,039
flower

927
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:30,320
is that correct yeah roughly okay

928
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:32,320
you know a lot of people are asking

929
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:35,119
questions about the soil

930
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,440
uh some of those questions are uh do you

931
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:38,800
put

932
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:41,200
worms in your beds and uh

933
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:44,800
does the soil get turned over when you

934
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:48,559
go to re-amend them after harvest

935
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:50,640
yeah so there is no uh

936
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:52,000
worm in the beds at the moment it's

937
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:55,039
something that we

938
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:57,280
would like to test at some point in time

939
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:58,480
we did some tests a little bit in the

940
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,359
past in uh

941
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,079
other other places in my room smaller

942
00:36:01,358 --> 00:36:05,440
fiction

943
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:08,000
forums were great uh the old bed turned

944
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:10,240
into uh basically warm casting for after

945
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,239
a while

946
00:36:10,838 --> 00:36:15,599
but

947
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,639
we are uh we had so much form that i was

948
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:18,480
wondering

949
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:20,319
how the fertilizer would not go into

950
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,920
work biomass instead of going into

951
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:25,119
flying violence

952
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,680
so we uh walked into a bit more about

953
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:28,400
that

954
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:29,838
and uh you can added the worm with

955
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,240
managing the irrigation

956
00:36:29,838 --> 00:36:33,838
uh you can have like longer irrigation

957
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:35,279
we're kind of gonna

958
00:36:33,838 --> 00:36:37,119
bring your warmth down into your bin

959
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:40,240
i've heard if you get to like a lot of

960
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:42,559
quality irrigation your surface is going

961
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:44,078
you can manage your population like that

962
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:45,759
it's something i would love to be able

963
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:47,680
to try but at the moment we're

964
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,440
using more good high quality warm

965
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:50,639
casting in some of our comfortable

966
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,960
disease

967
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:56,319
but we're still at like physical warmth

968
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:58,720
in the vids at the moment right now

969
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:00,400
okay so you are using worm castings with

970
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:01,598
making compost teas but though

971
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,480
they're not necessarily seeing a lot of

972
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:06,559
worms in your beds at this point in time

973
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:10,559
yeah yeah yeah we got some warm guesting

974
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:10,559
at some point that was full of warm eggs

975
00:37:11,358 --> 00:37:15,119
and uh we have another uh the initial

976
00:37:13,838 --> 00:37:16,639
facility we started here

977
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:18,720
there's so many warmth in those beds the

978
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:19,440
bloods are looking great too uh but it's

979
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:23,118
just something that

980
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:23,119
before we can fly this starts to scale

981
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:29,199
yeah and i would add when you're working

982
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:29,838
with these you know so-called living

983
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:31,919
soils

984
00:37:29,838 --> 00:37:33,838
if you are managing your irrigation and

985
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:35,200
you use worm castings you will get the

986
00:37:33,838 --> 00:37:36,960
eggs like you mentioned and a lot of

987
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:38,799
times worms will show up after a few

988
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,639
cycles in my experience

989
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:42,320
in your beds but i think that's an

990
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:45,039
interesting thing to look at is at what

991
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:47,039
level of biomat worm biomass are we

992
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:48,719
you know potentially beneficial or

993
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:50,159
possibly at some point it could become

994
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:53,519
detrimental if it's literally

995
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:56,480
all worms um moving on though

996
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:58,239
some people were asking uh if you turn

997
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:01,119
the soil when you go to reamend it

998
00:37:58,239 --> 00:38:02,319
and uh do you share it all how you are

999
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:04,320
what you're amending with

1000
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:06,960
is that something that that you share

1001
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:10,000
information on

1002
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:11,039
not so much there's a lot of uh straight

1003
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,639
secrets there's

1004
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:15,759
a lot of good things you can do i know

1005
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:17,279
that you probably have like a lot of

1006
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,599
information about this on your

1007
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:21,440
website there too about the real man man

1008
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:23,039
and the top dressing and all that we

1009
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:26,079
have our own way to do it

1010
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:27,599
we will add job dress uh just recycle

1011
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:30,160
that's gonna be mixed into

1012
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:32,000
uh planting oils and stuff like that we

1013
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:34,639
don't get to survive the whole during

1014
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,280
those in those dropping trucks because

1015
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:37,039
it would be

1016
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,640
like an incredible amount of work for us

1017
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:40,639
but uh we stopped dressing to get mixed

1018
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:42,319
in the first few inches of the soil

1019
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:44,960
and it seems to be working very well for

1020
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,960
us so far

1021
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:52,320
[Music]

1022
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:01,639
[Music]

1023
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:05,759
wonderful and uh how often are you

1024
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:08,160
testing the soil

1025
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:10,240
we're trying to do it like about twice

1026
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:14,559
per flowering cycle

1027
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:16,319
okay yeah and some okay so i just

1028
00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:17,440
anyway i'm just going to close the

1029
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,119
blinds because i want to show you what

1030
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:22,079
it looks like when we can turn

1031
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:24,079
this room into a nice mode okay while

1032
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:25,599
you're doing that i'm going to

1033
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:27,599
tackle a couple other questions here

1034
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:29,440
someone asked if you created your soil

1035
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:30,960
or if it was outsourced i happen to know

1036
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:33,039
the answer to that

1037
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,559
this is the soil that you formulated and

1038
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:36,239
created yourself

1039
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:38,159
um you and i actually have had

1040
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:39,919
discussions and you know in regards to

1041
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:41,920
some of the theories and

1042
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:43,760
optimal target values and things like

1043
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,880
that regarding these soils based off of

1044
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,800
soil tests

1045
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:48,880
and then stephanie also asked you use

1046
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,760
fertilizer or only rely on organic

1047
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,079
amendments

1048
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:54,160
well essentially these organic

1049
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:56,320
amendments are the fertilizer for

1050
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:57,358
feeding the microbes in the soil that

1051
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,039
are then cycling

1052
00:39:57,358 --> 00:40:00,880
a lot of these you know meals and

1053
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:02,480
nutrients things like alfalfa meal or

1054
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:05,680
kelp meal or whatever

1055
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:07,358
nutrient source you choose into um

1056
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:08,838
plant available fertilizer so i just

1057
00:40:07,358 --> 00:40:10,318
wanted to tackle those two really

1058
00:40:08,838 --> 00:40:12,880
quickly for you

1059
00:40:10,318 --> 00:40:14,239
and i think uh for yourself that i think

1060
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,880
you've been working with black swallow

1061
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:16,959
soil

1062
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,480
which are like a bunch of very great

1063
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,000
guys that just make sure you have i

1064
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:22,639
still have to get some of your

1065
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,519
just to try for fun uh with your mix

1066
00:40:22,639 --> 00:40:27,118
available in canada for those guys right

1067
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:29,039
yeah yeah i appreciate you mentioning

1068
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:30,960
that so uh we did come up with a

1069
00:40:29,039 --> 00:40:32,800
commercial soil available through black

1070
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,079
swallow living soils those are wonderful

1071
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,160
guys over there

1072
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:38,640
and uh i would love to run a trial at

1073
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:40,239
some point in your uh greenhouse

1074
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:41,920
but uh yeah i worked for a couple years

1075
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:43,358
with them with formulating uh

1076
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,280
a soil that would be commercially

1077
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:49,199
available for canadians

1078
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:50,800
uh as well as the us here so yeah

1079
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:54,399
um did you want to talk about the blind

1080
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,400
system sorry beautiful

1081
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:58,480
uh yeah so right now if you guys are

1082
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:00,559
looking above me uh it's

1083
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,519
the blackout surgeons are getting rolled

1084
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:03,838
out

1085
00:41:01,519 --> 00:41:05,358
so basically this is for a live solution

1086
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:06,719
at night and also if you control the

1087
00:41:05,358 --> 00:41:08,799
total period

1088
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:10,480
so this is now during summer time we're

1089
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,400
able to flower cannabis

1090
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,838
uh in the middle of summer just like the

1091
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,920
summer solstice so we

1092
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:17,199
have those lines coming in and out

1093
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,880
depending on uh

1094
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:21,279
when it works if we have it so we can

1095
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,838
flag out at the news western rooms that

1096
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,599
are

1097
00:41:21,838 --> 00:41:25,039
in the sun in the morning and some rooms

1098
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:27,440
that are in the sun in the afternoon to

1099
00:41:25,039 --> 00:41:30,880
manage a workflow or

1100
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:32,400
uh managing them here so take a few

1101
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,119
minutes as well this is why i wanted to

1102
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,119
close them

1103
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:38,318
earlier but it's actually quite

1104
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:41,200
impressive how dark you can get it

1105
00:41:38,318 --> 00:41:41,679
also the neighbor likes it because it's

1106
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:44,480
a

1107
00:41:41,679 --> 00:41:46,399
huge speaker flying that's leaving out

1108
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,760
those fluent led that we're running

1109
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:50,240
right now

1110
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,960
we have 800 red cpfd of supplemental

1111
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:53,838
light

1112
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,639
so that gets quite bright especially at

1113
00:41:53,838 --> 00:41:56,719
night

1114
00:41:54,639 --> 00:41:58,799
uh here when there's snow cover at night

1115
00:41:56,719 --> 00:42:01,439
and it's a cloudy uh

1116
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,640
night there's so much slight reflection

1117
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,720
in the clouds

1118
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:06,239
back into the snow so those greenhouses

1119
00:42:04,719 --> 00:42:09,598
get really really really bright

1120
00:42:06,239 --> 00:42:10,879
right so it was a shaker and taking away

1121
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:12,880
the slide solution

1122
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:14,800
and uh above the shade version i don't

1123
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,050
know the blackout circumstance above the

1124
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,440
[ __ ]

1125
00:42:15,050 --> 00:42:19,920
[Music]

1126
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:21,599
that does a little bit of a heat

1127
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,480
trapping to keep the greenhouse warm in

1128
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:25,079
the winter

1129
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:27,599
or uh bounce back some of the light that

1130
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:31,200
produces yeah

1131
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:35,119
so it's basically a translucent

1132
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:38,480
uh curtain up there and it's really nice

1133
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:40,559
maybe the younger plants who are uh

1134
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:42,000
reducing the light levels for a very

1135
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:43,519
bright day when the

1136
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,119
some of the planets get may get

1137
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:46,559
stretched from wiser from

1138
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:48,400
anything else that's the first thing

1139
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:49,279
that we do when we defend the stress a

1140
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,960
little bit

1141
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:54,560
just reduce the light level it allows

1142
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:56,318
them to catch up a little bit

1143
00:42:54,559 --> 00:42:57,838
that's that's really cool so just to

1144
00:42:56,318 --> 00:42:58,480
highlight since the connection's a

1145
00:42:57,838 --> 00:43:02,159
little bit rough

1146
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:02,800
you have a shade curtain and a blackout

1147
00:43:02,159 --> 00:43:04,318
curtain

1148
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:06,160
so you have the ability to totally

1149
00:43:04,318 --> 00:43:06,960
adjust your light levels and then those

1150
00:43:06,159 --> 00:43:09,199
fluent lights

1151
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,880
you said go up to 800 ppfd as

1152
00:43:09,199 --> 00:43:12,559
supplementary light for days when you're

1153
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:15,039
not getting as much solar

1154
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:17,199
energy or light as you would like and

1155
00:43:15,039 --> 00:43:19,838
then i assume those lights are dimmable

1156
00:43:17,199 --> 00:43:21,679
so you can they're not coming on at 800

1157
00:43:19,838 --> 00:43:23,838
uh ppfd immediately like

1158
00:43:21,679 --> 00:43:25,598
if you only need 200 ppfd then they'll

1159
00:43:23,838 --> 00:43:26,719
come on to adjust that and that's all

1160
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:29,440
computer

1161
00:43:26,719 --> 00:43:31,039
software controlled is that right yeah

1162
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:34,720
yeah we could uh uh

1163
00:43:31,039 --> 00:43:36,159
we could as we have those lightnings

1164
00:43:34,719 --> 00:43:36,480
here they have a built-in option where

1165
00:43:36,159 --> 00:43:38,399
like

1166
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:40,000
inside different status systems in real

1167
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:43,119
time and stuff like that

1168
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,400
we're not currently doing it but it's

1169
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:47,039
part of the continuous improvement

1170
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,039
project here

1171
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:52,318
so right now they're just on or off but

1172
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:54,240
we can do sections or roads

1173
00:43:52,318 --> 00:43:57,440
that's what it's uh looking like when

1174
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:57,439
the blackouts are closed

1175
00:43:57,838 --> 00:44:02,639
oh that's cool that's very cool yeah i'm

1176
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,960
gonna turn them back on so we can see

1177
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:04,960
again

1178
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:10,559
that happens pretty quickly too

1179
00:44:08,719 --> 00:44:12,239
that's amazing that you have such fast

1180
00:44:10,559 --> 00:44:14,318
control over the system it's so

1181
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:17,519
responsive

1182
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:20,400
yeah it's awesome it's awesome and uh

1183
00:44:17,519 --> 00:44:21,358
really when the last gap is closing it's

1184
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:24,318
been really good so

1185
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:25,598
it's also really uh really cool for us

1186
00:44:24,318 --> 00:44:27,599
for heat management

1187
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:28,880
we can like have different type of

1188
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:30,640
overlap from the

1189
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:32,720
shade curtain and the black upgrades

1190
00:44:30,639 --> 00:44:36,000
let's say uh when we're

1191
00:44:32,719 --> 00:44:39,519
treating this room with uh

1192
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,358
stuff like bavaria uh great finder trip

1193
00:44:39,519 --> 00:44:43,519
so we can reduce the amount of light

1194
00:44:41,358 --> 00:44:45,358
during the treatment uh increase the

1195
00:44:43,519 --> 00:44:47,759
humidity for a day or two

1196
00:44:45,358 --> 00:44:50,239
just to give a chance to benefit cells

1197
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:51,520
uh to reproduce and really uh kill the

1198
00:44:50,239 --> 00:44:54,000
best insects

1199
00:44:51,519 --> 00:44:55,920
uh and uh this is like managing your

1200
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,838
light levels with that

1201
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:02,318
testing system uh learn how to work this

1202
00:44:59,838 --> 00:45:03,679
with this awesome green one that's uh

1203
00:45:02,318 --> 00:45:04,639
that's part of the most excitement that

1204
00:45:03,679 --> 00:45:06,559
we have

1205
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:08,159
part of persuasion 2 sometimes and with

1206
00:45:06,559 --> 00:45:10,799
complexity from

1207
00:45:08,159 --> 00:45:12,480
troubleshooting with what we're able to

1208
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:15,920
do with this greenhouse which is just

1209
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:19,119
so cool and there's a lot more that is

1210
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:20,400
coming up

1211
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:22,079
it's really really exciting we've been

1212
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,838
working with a lot of people who give up

1213
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:26,318
new tools um

1214
00:45:23,838 --> 00:45:28,239
i know that you personally met a good

1215
00:45:26,318 --> 00:45:30,800
friend of mine uh

1216
00:45:28,239 --> 00:45:32,159
which means give us a bio fertilizer

1217
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,920
beneficial bacteria

1218
00:45:32,159 --> 00:45:35,199
i think we missed it in the other room

1219
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:37,358
we had a

1220
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:38,960
giant composting brewer it was going on

1221
00:45:37,358 --> 00:45:41,119
in there

1222
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,119
so

1223
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,079
we had a really awesome greenhouse that

1224
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:48,079
was delivered to us

1225
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:50,560
and we just needed to do some small

1226
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:53,839
finite legislation

1227
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:55,199
to make it like so exciting for

1228
00:45:53,838 --> 00:45:56,799
organic production there's stuff in here

1229
00:45:55,199 --> 00:45:57,039
now that kind of you're going to have to

1230
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,079
go

1231
00:45:57,039 --> 00:46:00,079
and walk with me one day

1232
00:46:06,159 --> 00:46:09,440
yeah uh so david let's talk a little bit

1233
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:13,039
about

1234
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:14,960
microbes you mentioned uh francois

1235
00:46:13,039 --> 00:46:16,639
and i know that he did some research on

1236
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:18,559
some insect frass

1237
00:46:16,639 --> 00:46:20,000
back in the day for you and found it had

1238
00:46:18,559 --> 00:46:21,838
some you know good calcium

1239
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,119
solubilizing and pea solubilizing

1240
00:46:21,838 --> 00:46:24,639
microbes

1241
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:26,800
i know you're working with a couple

1242
00:46:24,639 --> 00:46:28,159
company now on the microbial side you

1243
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:31,280
mentioned compost tea

1244
00:46:28,159 --> 00:46:31,838
what sort of microbial additions are you

1245
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:35,040
doing

1246
00:46:31,838 --> 00:46:37,358
in your in your rooms right now well

1247
00:46:35,039 --> 00:46:38,400
we're uh we're doing composting and we

1248
00:46:37,358 --> 00:46:41,759
build a

1249
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:41,760
good mobile uh

1250
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:49,599
the bottle reactor so we can basically

1251
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:51,920
uh make our own hydrolyze and

1252
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:53,440
whatever we want so this is pretty uh

1253
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:55,519
it's pretty cool to use

1254
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:56,720
fiddle with that uh the other stuff that

1255
00:46:55,519 --> 00:46:58,400
i'm sitting here we've been really cool

1256
00:46:56,719 --> 00:47:00,480
with working with uh there was a

1257
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:02,559
still splendor promoting rhizo bacteria

1258
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:05,440
that we started to work with frank

1259
00:47:02,559 --> 00:47:07,279
uh when we were in whistler a while back

1260
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,318
and we did some trials and all that and

1261
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,920
now we have a

1262
00:47:08,318 --> 00:47:11,759
commercially available product with that

1263
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:13,280
which is very close to uh this like

1264
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:15,200
uh i think a lot of people in this state

1265
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:17,200
know uh diamond p

1266
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:19,199
uh that would be not available in canada

1267
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:20,960
she's gonna make her own solution

1268
00:47:19,199 --> 00:47:22,838
which is different in battlefield got

1269
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:25,199
more mode of action but basically we

1270
00:47:22,838 --> 00:47:26,960
have selected isolated and

1271
00:47:25,199 --> 00:47:29,039
tested then it's very competitive

1272
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:31,679
environment which is only with soil

1273
00:47:29,039 --> 00:47:33,599
so we see benefits of using uh this

1274
00:47:31,679 --> 00:47:34,480
product now it's called uh microbial

1275
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:38,079
mass

1276
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:40,240
and uh i'll a little bit if you um

1277
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:41,480
like that really good one respond to

1278
00:47:40,239 --> 00:47:44,318
these socialized

1279
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:45,119
cinematic civilized phosphorus they

1280
00:47:44,318 --> 00:47:47,519
stabilize

1281
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:49,119
calcium and also uh that's where a

1282
00:47:47,519 --> 00:47:50,239
friend of really delivered designing

1283
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:53,440
microbial tests

1284
00:47:50,239 --> 00:47:56,479
and he added some bacteria uh enzymes

1285
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:58,480
and side arrow forms mineral cores are

1286
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:00,159
little chelating agents for stuff like

1287
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:03,760
copper iron manganese

1288
00:48:00,159 --> 00:48:06,000
virus and micronutrients so uh

1289
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:07,920
with more organic fertilizer organic

1290
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,679
amendments

1291
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:11,200
it really helps to mineralize them and

1292
00:48:09,679 --> 00:48:12,719
give us a good

1293
00:48:11,199 --> 00:48:16,318
growth rate for information that's one

1294
00:48:12,719 --> 00:48:16,318
of the that's composed

1295
00:48:18,838 --> 00:48:21,838
um

1296
00:48:26,318 --> 00:48:30,079
and how we deliver that to the soil how

1297
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:35,838
we keep them alive in the greenhouse

1298
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:35,839
within others

1299
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,200
amazing

1300
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:04,880
wow so you're using a just uh just a

1301
00:49:03,519 --> 00:49:06,400
highlight because i said it's a little

1302
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,920
tricky to hear you uh

1303
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,039
you're using everything i know you

1304
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,318
mentioned root shield which is a

1305
00:49:09,039 --> 00:49:13,440
trichoderma you mentioned

1306
00:49:10,318 --> 00:49:16,079
uh bulvaria those products are more for

1307
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:17,679
ipm or pest prevention whereas you have

1308
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:18,640
other things that you mentioned like the

1309
00:49:17,679 --> 00:49:20,719
compost tea

1310
00:49:18,639 --> 00:49:22,239
or this microbial mass product which i'm

1311
00:49:20,719 --> 00:49:23,759
really excited to test out

1312
00:49:22,239 --> 00:49:25,279
and then learn more about and and

1313
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:27,040
possibly even offer here in the united

1314
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:29,839
states here soon

1315
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:31,679
those products are more for plant growth

1316
00:49:29,838 --> 00:49:33,599
or overall plant health so

1317
00:49:31,679 --> 00:49:35,039
sort of a two-pronged approach there on

1318
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:36,559
the microbial side which

1319
00:49:35,039 --> 00:49:38,239
i know you and i have talked you feel is

1320
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:40,400
just as important as a lot of the

1321
00:49:38,239 --> 00:49:42,159
uh nutrients and fertilizers that that

1322
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:44,400
you're doing in the facility

1323
00:49:42,159 --> 00:49:46,318
um but let's uh let's keep the tour

1324
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,639
moving along uh one other question that

1325
00:49:46,318 --> 00:49:48,239
guy

1326
00:49:46,639 --> 00:49:49,838
asked here and i'm trying to get to as

1327
00:49:48,239 --> 00:49:53,039
many questions as i can people

1328
00:49:49,838 --> 00:49:54,799
uh i'll do my best uh he asked

1329
00:49:53,039 --> 00:49:56,400
is with the pure size of this facility

1330
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:57,760
how do you manage all this green waste

1331
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:59,280
and i thought that was a really good

1332
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:01,200
question because you must be producing a

1333
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:04,960
lot of biomass

1334
00:50:01,199 --> 00:50:07,519
yes we uh just come posted on site

1335
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:09,760
so basically we have a chipper like a

1336
00:50:07,519 --> 00:50:12,960
big wood chipper so we will stamp

1337
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:14,800
the waste in there mix with some teeth

1338
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:18,559
and just get our teeth to teenage your

1339
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:18,559
ends getting disgusting

1340
00:50:18,719 --> 00:50:26,000
so basically we send everything to the

1341
00:50:21,358 --> 00:50:28,159
difference because it outside

1342
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,039
we are not reusing this compost in the

1343
00:50:28,159 --> 00:50:31,519
grove or

1344
00:50:29,039 --> 00:50:33,039
uh issues stuff like that but we do have

1345
00:50:31,519 --> 00:50:35,280
a community farm

1346
00:50:33,039 --> 00:50:36,639
on the uh on the side here this is where

1347
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:39,040
this temple is getting used for

1348
00:50:36,639 --> 00:50:40,960
workers to uh we offer a little

1349
00:50:39,039 --> 00:50:41,920
community vlog here so people can use

1350
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:43,679
that

1351
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:45,760
uh cannabis comfortable instead of an

1352
00:50:43,679 --> 00:50:47,519
easy way to fertilize our garden in this

1353
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:49,359
cover here

1354
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:50,480
wonderful so real quick david you

1355
00:50:49,358 --> 00:50:51,838
actually sound pretty good right there

1356
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:54,400
so let me just ask you a couple other

1357
00:50:51,838 --> 00:50:57,679
quick questions

1358
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:59,680
uh people are asking about irrigation so

1359
00:50:57,679 --> 00:51:00,879
one question is do you run compost tea

1360
00:50:59,679 --> 00:51:02,639
through the drip tape

1361
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:04,000
um and then the other questions are how

1362
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:08,318
are you managing soil

1363
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:10,719
moisture and irrigation in these rims

1364
00:51:08,318 --> 00:51:12,800
so uh yeah we will run compost through

1365
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:15,279
the drip tape but we'll just need to

1366
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:16,480
make sure that uh if you want to do that

1367
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:19,440
just going to make sure that you get a

1368
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:19,440
drip tape if you're not

1369
00:51:20,239 --> 00:51:23,439
your compost you will get filtered

1370
00:51:21,838 --> 00:51:24,239
through the proper micro size before you

1371
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:27,200
get into

1372
00:51:24,239 --> 00:51:28,399
uh your irrigation tubes too so for you

1373
00:51:27,199 --> 00:51:29,439
to figure out with the equipment that

1374
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:34,400
you're running

1375
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:34,400
uh and also flush your line after

1376
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:38,240
that's how we're doing we apply it by

1377
00:51:36,719 --> 00:51:39,759
hand too and

1378
00:51:38,239 --> 00:51:42,000
head application works great it's

1379
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:42,720
awesome it just takes forever when

1380
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,639
you're watering

1381
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:46,318
one of a football field and a half by

1382
00:51:44,639 --> 00:51:50,000
hand uh

1383
00:51:46,318 --> 00:51:52,000
so and how we manage the irrigation

1384
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,079
there's a couple strategies that we can

1385
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:57,440
do we have

1386
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:59,440
soil moisture meters uh we also have

1387
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:01,039
uh the total amount of light that the

1388
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:04,000
plants are getting every day

1389
00:52:01,039 --> 00:52:05,920
and uh we are in a water-based and the

1390
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,679
amount of irradiation we get so

1391
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:09,760
we know that the plants that they get so

1392
00:52:07,679 --> 00:52:10,799
many so much energy and that's where you

1393
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:12,079
have to start to think about the

1394
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:15,200
greenhouse

1395
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:15,839
uh wax per square meter uh if the plants

1396
00:52:15,199 --> 00:52:17,439
are getting

1397
00:52:15,838 --> 00:52:19,679
so many watts well then it means they're

1398
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:22,400
going to need so much water to

1399
00:52:19,679 --> 00:52:25,118
make up for the uptake of that and or we

1400
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:25,119
can just have to

1401
00:52:25,199 --> 00:52:28,399
deplete on the timer so every hour we

1402
00:52:27,838 --> 00:52:31,279
water

1403
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:33,599
uh four minutes four times per route

1404
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:36,240
that's an example of a common strategy

1405
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:37,519
here so basically it's a lot of them

1406
00:52:36,239 --> 00:52:39,199
walk in your greenhouse

1407
00:52:37,519 --> 00:52:42,239
you walk in check walk and check

1408
00:52:39,199 --> 00:52:43,679
everything so you then you can find

1409
00:52:42,239 --> 00:52:47,118
a different type of growth different

1410
00:52:43,679 --> 00:52:50,480
spray and also different seasons

1411
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:52,559
uh ideal uh

1412
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:54,159
stream scenario would be uh there's a

1413
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:55,920
bunch of companies out there that do a

1414
00:52:54,159 --> 00:52:56,639
real-time irrigation system basically

1415
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:58,880
you have a

1416
00:52:56,639 --> 00:53:00,558
soil moisture sensor that can stop your

1417
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:03,838
climate control software

1418
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:05,519
so argus rivas damatec a bunch of other

1419
00:53:03,838 --> 00:53:07,519
stuff but if you can

1420
00:53:05,519 --> 00:53:09,280
set thresholds in the same way then you

1421
00:53:07,519 --> 00:53:11,519
can oh if the room reach a

1422
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:13,359
35 degree exhausted while the soil

1423
00:53:11,519 --> 00:53:16,639
moisture level reach this limit

1424
00:53:13,358 --> 00:53:18,318
water in so let's get into more

1425
00:53:16,639 --> 00:53:20,159
precision agriculture

1426
00:53:18,318 --> 00:53:21,599
they certainly have that endorsed shirt

1427
00:53:20,159 --> 00:53:24,078
and field crop which is

1428
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:24,720
working really really good especially

1429
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:26,160
you can have

1430
00:53:24,719 --> 00:53:28,480
different zones in your greenhouse which

1431
00:53:26,159 --> 00:53:30,719
is awesome uh right now we are in the

1432
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:31,920
north side of the greenhouse and it's

1433
00:53:30,719 --> 00:53:33,439
getting a little bit less

1434
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:35,280
light in winter than the south side of

1435
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:37,039
the greenhouse so this is stuff that you

1436
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:37,519
use learn how to work with your facility

1437
00:53:37,039 --> 00:53:42,239
but it's

1438
00:53:37,519 --> 00:53:42,239
just trying stuff and testing it

1439
00:53:47,519 --> 00:53:52,880
very cool so uh let's go ahead and move

1440
00:53:51,838 --> 00:53:55,279
on to the next

1441
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:56,000
uh the next space i'm excited to see the

1442
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:57,599
plants as they

1443
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,280
move further into flowering here it's

1444
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:00,960
it's kind of fun we're just gonna move

1445
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:02,319
uh across the hall and we're gonna see

1446
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:02,800
if plants are gonna be harvested in

1447
00:54:02,318 --> 00:54:11,838
about

1448
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:11,839
two three weeks from now

1449
00:54:15,010 --> 00:54:20,319
[Music]

1450
00:54:17,199 --> 00:54:23,279
oh that's cool wow

1451
00:54:20,318 --> 00:54:26,079
so a couple people have asked about your

1452
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:28,640
pruning if you're doing any lollipopping

1453
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:31,359
how you're pruning your plants could you

1454
00:54:28,639 --> 00:54:33,039
touch on that that's a cool shot

1455
00:54:31,358 --> 00:54:36,480
can you touch on your pruning for me

1456
00:54:33,039 --> 00:54:36,480
david yeah

1457
00:54:36,838 --> 00:54:41,358
um

1458
00:54:38,318 --> 00:54:42,558
bit of a challenge for us not too much

1459
00:54:41,358 --> 00:54:44,480
but

1460
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:45,839
my approach to pruning is during fetal

1461
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:49,679
diet collection

1462
00:54:45,838 --> 00:54:53,838
uh trying to go to france or kind of a

1463
00:54:49,679 --> 00:54:53,838
self-ruling or self-defeating

1464
00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:01,358
hey david yeah i hate to interrupt you

1465
00:54:59,679 --> 00:55:03,519
it was it's really hard to hear you i

1466
00:55:01,358 --> 00:55:05,119
think you were saying that you're trying

1467
00:55:03,519 --> 00:55:07,199
to select phenotypes that require

1468
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:09,119
less pruning because of the amount of

1469
00:55:07,199 --> 00:55:09,759
labor involved on the scale that you're

1470
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:11,519
at

1471
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:12,960
um yeah but it's just a little bit hard

1472
00:55:11,519 --> 00:55:14,480
to hear you can you uh

1473
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:16,318
can you just maybe talk a little louder

1474
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:19,039
moving forward here yeah yeah

1475
00:55:16,318 --> 00:55:21,119
so uh i'll get tyler to keep giving you

1476
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:22,960
a shot of the plan so i'll try to

1477
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:24,318
talk a bit louder but yes this is

1478
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:26,079
exactly it but if those are the

1479
00:55:24,318 --> 00:55:28,318
different phenotypes that uh

1480
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:30,000
reflecting so this type of planet

1481
00:55:28,318 --> 00:55:31,279
architecture here that's never really

1482
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,159
been pruned that's never been really

1483
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:34,559
believed

1484
00:55:32,159 --> 00:55:36,000
uh it's giving us like very good yields

1485
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:37,760
to where we have some plants that are

1486
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,119
really dense and foliage really packed

1487
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:41,200
in contact with

1488
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:43,440
plants that are stretching a little bit

1489
00:55:41,199 --> 00:55:44,960
look like they're doing better for us

1490
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:46,480
uh this is what we've been trying to

1491
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:49,280
select for in here

1492
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:49,920
uh pruning takes a lot of time so it's

1493
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,760
uh

1494
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:53,519
that's one aspect of it but the second

1495
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:57,520
one is also

1496
00:55:53,519 --> 00:55:59,119
timing it's all about trying to

1497
00:55:57,519 --> 00:56:00,880
blend this and the flesh is looking

1498
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:02,880
really good

1499
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:05,440
with them at the right time give them a

1500
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:07,599
little white room as we're planting them

1501
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:09,679
uh so that's what it is so every time we

1502
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:12,798
have a plan in our hands we're drinking

1503
00:56:09,679 --> 00:56:15,358
make as many action or a

1504
00:56:12,798 --> 00:56:17,679
task that needs to happen with me like

1505
00:56:15,358 --> 00:56:18,798
tough relief a little bit and prune at

1506
00:56:17,679 --> 00:56:20,399
planting room but

1507
00:56:18,798 --> 00:56:21,838
putting our veggies plants in there

1508
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:26,079
they're about uh

1509
00:56:21,838 --> 00:56:28,558
uh 18 to 24 centimeters tall

1510
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:30,000
so uh we don't have to test them as much

1511
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:32,240
later on

1512
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:34,480
phenotype selection is a big one too so

1513
00:56:32,239 --> 00:56:36,159
that's how we approach it it's not been

1514
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:37,599
perfect and we're large learning and you

1515
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:40,000
have to grow the scale

1516
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:41,519
but we've been pulling some really good

1517
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,920
um

1518
00:56:41,519 --> 00:56:46,719
numbers anyway out of here the main

1519
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:49,039
difference we've seen

1520
00:56:46,719 --> 00:56:50,318
is a bit of modernity because the plants

1521
00:56:49,039 --> 00:56:53,920
are getting less light

1522
00:56:50,318 --> 00:56:55,440
they are uh not as the bottom part of

1523
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:57,280
the glass does that thing aside so we

1524
00:56:55,440 --> 00:57:01,440
tend to keep this stuff for

1525
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:03,119
an extraction or for a

1526
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:04,480
hash making production which is a new

1527
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:06,160
thing that a new

1528
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:08,719
project that we've been started we've

1529
00:57:06,159 --> 00:57:08,719
started here

1530
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:14,640
cool uh so a couple other quick random

1531
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:16,240
questions uh is the excess water from

1532
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:18,078
the irrigation

1533
00:57:16,239 --> 00:57:19,679
reclaimed or recycled do you have a lot

1534
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:20,559
of excess water with the way that you're

1535
00:57:19,679 --> 00:57:27,838
managing

1536
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:27,839
these plants for these beds

1537
00:57:34,139 --> 00:57:38,400
[Music]

1538
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:40,720
and those gutters are recollecting the

1539
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:40,720
water

1540
00:57:47,429 --> 00:57:50,480
[Music]

1541
00:57:53,519 --> 00:57:55,838
allows

1542
00:58:06,210 --> 00:58:09,289
[Music]

1543
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,839
we

1544
00:58:48,838 --> 00:58:51,838
uh

1545
00:58:54,639 --> 00:58:57,199
it's a little hard to hear you david but

1546
00:58:56,079 --> 00:58:57,839
i think what you're saying is you

1547
00:58:57,199 --> 00:59:00,318
collect

1548
00:58:57,838 --> 00:59:01,920
both the rainwater and the runoff the

1549
00:59:00,318 --> 00:59:04,960
runoff through a gutter system

1550
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:06,880
the rain water through the ceiling uh

1551
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:08,639
and it's all filtered and collected and

1552
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:10,720
then recycled when possible

1553
00:59:08,639 --> 00:59:13,118
is that right yeah yeah even the

1554
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:16,558
condensate

1555
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:18,400
gets reused very cool

1556
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:20,079
and then another random question i know

1557
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,559
we talked about that microbial mass

1558
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:22,240
product

1559
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:24,559
uh i don't believe it's available in the

1560
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:27,679
us yet as far as i know

1561
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:28,720
um is it available in canada can you can

1562
00:59:27,679 --> 00:59:31,519
you address that for

1563
00:59:28,719 --> 00:59:32,480
the listener it's available in canada

1564
00:59:31,519 --> 00:59:35,039
it's available

1565
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:35,920
with the quality wholesale which is the

1566
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:39,519
commercial

1567
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:39,519
hydroponic uh gardener

1568
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:44,400
suppliers they have a bunch of uh good

1569
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:46,798
stuff and they're

1570
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:47,838
starting to carry our microbial mass

1571
00:59:46,798 --> 00:59:50,639
product but we're

1572
00:59:47,838 --> 00:59:52,159
we're just rolling it out into space too

1573
00:59:50,639 --> 00:59:53,279
and we'll make sure that uh we'll give

1574
00:59:52,159 --> 00:59:55,759
you a few simple

1575
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:56,960
assassins you can give them in your butt

1576
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:58,559
pass or something or people going

1577
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:00,079
together to get at least to try and

1578
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:01,760
but it's it's a really awesome product

1579
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:06,160
we're really happy with it

1580
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:08,640
and uh yeah it's been been really good

1581
01:00:06,159 --> 01:00:09,519
wow that's a cool the coolest part about

1582
01:00:08,639 --> 01:00:11,759
it too is that

1583
01:00:09,519 --> 01:00:13,599
we had a lot of commercial tomato

1584
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:15,520
growers or field potato growers that

1585
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:17,200
tried it i didn't work for commercial

1586
01:00:15,519 --> 01:00:18,079
act too that's one of my favorite things

1587
01:00:17,199 --> 01:00:20,558
when we

1588
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:22,318
work with cannabis specific inputs if

1589
01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:24,720
they work in commercial ag and it makes

1590
01:00:22,318 --> 01:00:26,880
sense for a guy to throw

1591
01:00:24,719 --> 01:00:28,558
potatoes or tomatoes in a greenhouse you

1592
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:30,079
can monetize that it means that for us

1593
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:32,319
and cannabis it's a really good input to

1594
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:34,240
do that

1595
01:00:32,318 --> 01:00:35,838
yeah i think that's a key point um i'm

1596
01:00:34,239 --> 01:00:36,798
about to record a podcast with uh

1597
01:00:35,838 --> 01:00:38,159
suzanne

1598
01:00:36,798 --> 01:00:40,239
uh the bug lady and that's something

1599
01:00:38,159 --> 01:00:41,920
that i think that we're gonna cover when

1600
01:00:40,239 --> 01:00:43,118
we talk about evaluating a product the

1601
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:44,639
fact that

1602
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:46,400
we want to look for products that are

1603
01:00:44,639 --> 01:00:47,199
out in commercial egg or make sense in

1604
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:49,039
commercial egg

1605
01:00:47,199 --> 01:00:50,879
because if it can make sense on a lower

1606
01:00:49,039 --> 01:00:52,960
value crop then it certainly can make

1607
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:54,240
sense for cannabis

1608
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:56,318
so i think that's a good thing to

1609
01:00:54,239 --> 01:00:58,239
highlight there that you pointed out

1610
01:00:56,318 --> 01:00:59,679
uh what can you tell us a little bit

1611
01:00:58,239 --> 01:01:01,598
about what you know

1612
01:00:59,679 --> 01:01:04,399
what day in flower you are and what

1613
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:07,680
cultivars you're running in this room

1614
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:09,440
uh so in this room we're about in the

1615
01:01:07,679 --> 01:01:10,960
beginning of week seven and you still

1616
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:13,280
have about a few weeks ago that they're

1617
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:17,490
really uh finishing right now

1618
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:19,760
we have some uh global fish frost

1619
01:01:17,489 --> 01:01:21,039
[Music]

1620
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:22,240
you know outside something we got

1621
01:01:21,039 --> 01:01:24,798
something that's really cool it's not

1622
01:01:22,239 --> 01:01:27,279
exactly and above a question

1623
01:01:24,798 --> 01:01:29,119
it's kind of a look to it we call it a

1624
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:30,640
west coast bush and it reminded me a lot

1625
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:31,680
of a lot of this great equation we're

1626
01:01:30,639 --> 01:01:33,358
going out with

1627
01:01:31,679 --> 01:01:35,039
i'm as a little nostalgic from the

1628
01:01:33,358 --> 01:01:36,838
beautiful one silver you're still lucky

1629
01:01:35,039 --> 01:01:39,838
to live sad right now

1630
01:01:36,838 --> 01:01:39,838
um

1631
01:01:40,719 --> 01:01:45,279
we have another really cool screen in

1632
01:01:42,798 --> 01:01:46,480
here it's just been a beautiful pinot

1633
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:47,920
noir

1634
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:51,358
from the process that we did that's

1635
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:51,358
called organic

1636
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:54,559
it fire beautifully he's got a big

1637
01:01:53,039 --> 01:01:58,318
structure we've got a really good

1638
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:58,319
yield on a surprisingly good deal

1639
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:04,079
about twenty percent for us so we're

1640
01:02:01,039 --> 01:02:04,079
just rolling those frames

1641
01:02:05,358 --> 01:02:08,798
you seem off do pretty well and uh we've

1642
01:02:07,519 --> 01:02:10,719
got a beautiful

1643
01:02:08,798 --> 01:02:12,239
beautiful bucket left-handed nose from

1644
01:02:10,719 --> 01:02:14,000
here uh

1645
01:02:12,239 --> 01:02:15,598
and there's there's good trichome

1646
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,159
development as well so we're looking

1647
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:18,160
forward to

1648
01:02:16,159 --> 01:02:19,920
the uh what we're going to get in terms

1649
01:02:18,159 --> 01:02:23,519
of harvesting those who improve

1650
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:26,240
and we've just got you to uh

1651
01:02:23,519 --> 01:02:28,000
fine-tune recently as well so we're

1652
01:02:26,239 --> 01:02:31,118
getting some really nice uh

1653
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,119
increased growth from that

1654
01:02:31,199 --> 01:02:34,239
so about two weeks and you think they're

1655
01:02:33,519 --> 01:02:36,000
going to finish

1656
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:38,479
uh much taller is this about the height

1657
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:40,159
your plants have been finishing

1658
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:41,599
no they're going to finish at this size

1659
01:02:40,159 --> 01:02:42,798
yeah they're they're they're the threats

1660
01:02:41,599 --> 01:02:46,318
here mostly

1661
01:02:42,798 --> 01:02:49,280
getting some uh hardening and

1662
01:02:46,318 --> 01:02:49,279
swelling it's

1663
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:57,119
we have a room that's supposed to be

1664
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:58,880
going for extraction it's a cbd crop

1665
01:02:57,119 --> 01:03:00,960
and especially in the summer you know

1666
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:02,240
plants tend to stretch a lot of

1667
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:03,920
that we have the use we have to give

1668
01:03:02,239 --> 01:03:04,719
that a requirement strategy and growth

1669
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:06,480
strategy to

1670
01:03:04,719 --> 01:03:08,078
take that into account because the same

1671
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:08,960
strain looks a bit different in winter

1672
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:10,880
than summer

1673
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:12,159
we have a fairly good idea we want to

1674
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:13,280
tackle that now

1675
01:03:12,159 --> 01:03:16,879
but that's part of growing with the

1676
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:18,640
season and the greenhouse as well

1677
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:20,880
so david take me through your

1678
01:03:18,639 --> 01:03:22,239
re-amendment process and harvest process

1679
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:24,720
so you're going to come in here

1680
01:03:22,239 --> 01:03:27,038
pull the plants are you pulling out much

1681
01:03:24,719 --> 01:03:28,399
of the root balls

1682
01:03:27,039 --> 01:03:30,640
what does that look like how soon are

1683
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:34,400
you replanting

1684
01:03:30,639 --> 01:03:36,480
uh we can replant it after a harvest

1685
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:38,240
there's a bunch of different uh liquid

1686
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:39,920
and dry amendments we can add ketograms

1687
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:42,558
so basically we're gonna come in there

1688
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:44,240
we're gonna cut the holes line down uh

1689
01:03:42,559 --> 01:03:45,839
then we're gonna remove the root balls

1690
01:03:44,239 --> 01:03:47,679
and by the rhubarb we're gonna remove

1691
01:03:45,838 --> 01:03:49,838
something this big the big stock that's

1692
01:03:47,679 --> 01:03:52,960
not gonna break down very fast

1693
01:03:49,838 --> 01:03:54,159
uh then we're gonna do a tough dress and

1694
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:56,639
we're gonna flatten it there

1695
01:03:54,159 --> 01:03:58,558
the following day we like to do a little

1696
01:03:56,639 --> 01:03:59,920
bit of a compost here

1697
01:03:58,559 --> 01:04:01,599
some stuff that's going to activate the

1698
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:03,039
microbiology so we're going to have a

1699
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:05,200
breakdown up here we're getting better

1700
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:06,799
as faster as this and by the time that

1701
01:04:05,199 --> 01:04:08,639
one recovered from the

1702
01:04:06,798 --> 01:04:09,920
subdressing the whole plant when we

1703
01:04:08,639 --> 01:04:11,920
removed the stock to

1704
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:13,519
the roots tend to die and break down way

1705
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:15,599
faster

1706
01:04:13,519 --> 01:04:16,798
so it's fairly simple actually the way

1707
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:19,599
we've been doing it

1708
01:04:16,798 --> 01:04:21,280
but the biggest one for us is managing

1709
01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:24,079
the very first to make sure we can

1710
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:26,240
transition from one room fast enough and

1711
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:28,559
we're getting into a very good base

1712
01:04:26,239 --> 01:04:30,000
uh room right now so this room is going

1713
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:32,319
to be in the uh

1714
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:35,199
our target is nc only for a day or two

1715
01:04:32,318 --> 01:04:36,558
and then we can reflect in it

1716
01:04:35,199 --> 01:04:38,159
wonderful i know we talked about

1717
01:04:36,559 --> 01:04:39,200
microbes already but a few people have

1718
01:04:38,159 --> 01:04:42,239
asked if you're using

1719
01:04:39,199 --> 01:04:42,960
any like probiotic korean natural

1720
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:46,798
farming

1721
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:51,760
indigenous microbe sort of strategies

1722
01:04:46,798 --> 01:04:55,838
in this facility uh

1723
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:55,839
not not exactly like that no

1724
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:59,039
i like those ideas they're great we have

1725
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:02,240
a lot of

1726
01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:03,839
uh compliance and anything every food

1727
01:05:02,239 --> 01:05:08,399
and stuff that we have to go with with

1728
01:05:03,838 --> 01:05:09,920
this legal commercial scale so can use

1729
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:11,039
good compost and richness serve you have

1730
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:12,480
to

1731
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:14,319
prove that they've been following

1732
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:14,639
certain uh terrible temperature and all

1733
01:05:14,318 --> 01:05:16,960
that

1734
01:05:14,639 --> 01:05:17,838
for us to go harvest wildlife growth

1735
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:21,760
they're

1736
01:05:17,838 --> 01:05:22,719
probably very highly beneficial uh plan

1737
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:25,920
out

1738
01:05:22,719 --> 01:05:26,399
we would do that if you were to uh but

1739
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:30,079
we do

1740
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:33,280
use different composting different

1741
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:36,720
type of amendments and that will

1742
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:39,760
nourish biology or

1743
01:05:36,719 --> 01:05:41,038
glitter composting that's basically how

1744
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:43,039
we've been adding vitals

1745
01:05:41,039 --> 01:05:44,480
you have like several different type of

1746
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:46,640
composting

1747
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:47,920
contributing to powering or badge and

1748
01:05:46,639 --> 01:05:51,838
stuff like that

1749
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:51,838
so this is how we

1750
01:05:52,239 --> 01:05:55,838
so so what i'm hearing is you're not

1751
01:05:53,679 --> 01:05:57,598
necessarily opposed to it but also i

1752
01:05:55,838 --> 01:05:59,440
would think on the scale that you're at

1753
01:05:57,599 --> 01:06:01,680
you need to have very controlled

1754
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:03,440
inputs to know what you're adding into

1755
01:06:01,679 --> 01:06:05,279
your garden um

1756
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:06,480
because it is such a massive scale too

1757
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:10,160
so that would just be something i think

1758
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:10,159
that would factor into in that decision

1759
01:06:10,719 --> 01:06:14,480
show you maybe a bit of the bed area and

1760
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:17,200
the cloning area

1761
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:18,240
uh the last step is going to overheat in

1762
01:06:17,199 --> 01:06:21,279
the sun right now

1763
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:22,318
and uh we're not moving around it's

1764
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:25,760
getting pretty odd for us

1765
01:06:22,318 --> 01:06:28,079
going in here all right let's keep

1766
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:28,079
moving

1767
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:31,599
it's just hard to want to leave the

1768
01:06:29,679 --> 01:06:32,879
flowering room there it's uh it looks

1769
01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:36,000
great in there

1770
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:36,000
um yeah well wow

1771
01:06:36,318 --> 01:06:39,358
and it keeps looking better and it keeps

1772
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:41,119
looking there's new personalize that

1773
01:06:39,358 --> 01:06:42,880
we're using

1774
01:06:41,119 --> 01:06:44,720
it's fine-tuning everything and also

1775
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:46,000
this is the first time you go as great

1776
01:06:44,719 --> 01:06:48,719
as this

1777
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:50,318
we always learn a little bit uh but like

1778
01:06:48,719 --> 01:06:52,399
the potential between some of those

1779
01:06:50,318 --> 01:06:53,119
realtors yielding agency goes to the

1780
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:56,559
missing

1781
01:06:53,119 --> 01:06:59,599
tests are and came back into uh

1782
01:06:56,559 --> 01:06:59,599
above like 30

1783
01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:12,079
oh that's great that's great we might be

1784
01:07:10,798 --> 01:07:15,038
jumpy a little bit but

1785
01:07:12,079 --> 01:07:15,760
uh can hear you guys to see what i'm

1786
01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:17,200
talking about

1787
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:19,440
we're just gonna walk to a different

1788
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:21,118
building uh where we do propagation and

1789
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:22,960
bench

1790
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:24,079
okay well i'll i'll read some more of

1791
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:24,798
these questions that people have been

1792
01:07:24,079 --> 01:07:26,880
asking

1793
01:07:24,798 --> 01:07:29,199
uh one of them being i know uh they

1794
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:30,720
they're asking about odor pollution

1795
01:07:29,199 --> 01:07:32,159
do you control order pollution as part

1796
01:07:30,719 --> 01:07:33,038
of your licensing rules company

1797
01:07:32,159 --> 01:07:34,879
standards

1798
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:36,960
if so what size and quantity of carbon

1799
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:39,280
filters are you running for this room

1800
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:41,679
i know you had mentioned uh that you do

1801
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:43,920
have carbon filters that the air will be

1802
01:07:41,679 --> 01:07:46,078
scrubbed before being exhausted

1803
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:47,519
but i didn't know the size of those and

1804
01:07:46,079 --> 01:07:48,559
someone else had also asked how many

1805
01:07:47,519 --> 01:07:50,000
lights are in a room and that was

1806
01:07:48,559 --> 01:07:50,798
another question that i wanted to throw

1807
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,400
out there

1808
01:07:50,798 --> 01:07:54,000
oh is that a is that a compost tea

1809
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:57,838
brewer right there that you just we

1810
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:57,838
walked by is that your bioreactor

1811
01:07:59,269 --> 01:08:10,079
[Music]

1812
01:08:06,239 --> 01:08:11,679
okay it's a vixen tank all right

1813
01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:14,720
sorry it's noisy in there i'll let you

1814
01:08:11,679 --> 01:08:16,479
keep walking david sorry

1815
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:18,479
so when you get to the next room maybe

1816
01:08:16,479 --> 01:08:21,759
you could answer those two questions

1817
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:22,718
uh about number of lights and uh also

1818
01:08:21,759 --> 01:08:25,838
size of

1819
01:08:22,719 --> 01:08:25,838
carbon filters

1820
01:08:37,039 --> 01:08:41,278
you said 800 lights is that right

1821
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:50,158
holy cow wow well 400 or 800.

1822
01:08:47,838 --> 01:08:51,119
there's two lights per saddle between

1823
01:08:50,158 --> 01:08:53,599
the fixture

1824
01:08:51,119 --> 01:08:54,719
but it's a supplemental uh and that's

1825
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:56,719
the number that really matters

1826
01:08:54,719 --> 01:08:57,838
is because it's the supplements elevator

1827
01:08:56,719 --> 01:09:00,319
directing

1828
01:08:57,838 --> 01:09:01,838
the brand so with no sun when the

1829
01:09:00,319 --> 01:09:04,839
blackout curtains are

1830
01:09:01,838 --> 01:09:06,158
closed uh we have eight of the rest of

1831
01:09:04,838 --> 01:09:07,600
these

1832
01:09:06,158 --> 01:09:09,439
are those the vipers that you're running

1833
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:13,039
too yeah

1834
01:09:09,439 --> 01:09:15,119
the viper x-flex viper x plus

1835
01:09:13,039 --> 01:09:21,838
man fluence is a lucky company to have

1836

horticultural uh consulting thing and

1847
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:45,119
it's been uh

1848
01:09:42,079 --> 01:09:46,719
we've been working with them for uh

1849
01:09:45,119 --> 01:09:48,479
i've been working with them for six

1850
01:09:46,719 --> 01:09:49,759
years

1851
01:09:48,479 --> 01:09:51,678
there's just a good company they've got

1852
01:09:49,759 --> 01:09:54,560
a lot of really good critical signs

1853
01:09:51,679 --> 01:09:57,039
information about dds you need to

1854
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:57,600
highlight an entity dvd on their website

1855
01:09:57,039 --> 01:10:00,079
so

1856
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:01,390
they're just like really approaching it

1857
01:10:00,079 --> 01:10:02,640
from the commercial act

1858
01:10:01,390 --> 01:10:05,360
[Music]

1859
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:06,079
to show that you kind of like which they

1860
01:10:05,359 --> 01:10:10,639
do as well

1861
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:10,640
but it's been really good

1862
01:10:11,439 --> 01:10:21,198
very cool

1863
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:24,799
man this is a huge facility yeah

1864
01:10:21,198 --> 01:10:31,839
good workout weekly kilometers

1865
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:31,840
you push your work a couple kilometers

1866
01:10:32,750 --> 01:10:35,828
[Music]

1867
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:46,560
uh

1868
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:49,039
david i'm losing you for just a moment

1869
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:49,840
here uh so let's just hold off while it

1870
01:10:49,039 --> 01:10:51,198
reconnects

1871
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:53,199
uh on your end at least with the

1872
01:10:51,198 --> 01:10:54,960
propagation space

1873
01:10:53,198 --> 01:10:56,238
um if you could give us just one second

1874
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:59,840
here before you start up

1875
01:10:56,238 --> 01:10:59,839
if you can hear me

1876
01:11:04,399 --> 01:11:08,319
all right looks like we are still

1877
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:12,158
waiting

1878
01:11:08,319 --> 01:11:13,759
uh one other question that ben asked

1879
01:11:12,158 --> 01:11:14,799
oh you're back i'll let you go and

1880
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:18,239
continue and then i'll come back to

1881
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:18,239
ben's question here in just a little bit

1882
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:24,840
here so yeah right now we're in uh what

1883
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:27,840
we call the farmhouse building

1884
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:27,840
uh

1885
01:11:33,689 --> 01:11:40,559
[Music]

1886
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:43,119
what do here this is where we have a

1887
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:46,560
vertical uh growing process

1888
01:11:43,119 --> 01:11:51,198
uh and we are uh cloning vertically

1889
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:51,199
and uh virtually

1890
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:57,360
so so david i know i know you're moving

1891
01:11:55,439 --> 01:11:58,879
from space to space and this is just not

1892
01:11:57,359 --> 01:12:02,000
a normal thing that you would do but

1893
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:04,079
we have this tour uh when we talk about

1894
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:05,760
propagation though and your employees

1895
01:12:04,079 --> 01:12:07,519
would you have specific employees that

1896
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:08,960
would pretty much stay in propagation

1897
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:09,920
and other ones that would stay in flower

1898
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:10,960
to sort of avoid this

1899
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:13,600
cross-contamination

1900
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:14,960
from an ipm perspective yeah yeah we

1901
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:20,400
actually absolutely do

1902
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:23,198
uh we have teams that are like

1903
01:12:20,399 --> 01:12:25,039
they learn in passive propagation

1904
01:12:23,198 --> 01:12:26,719
transplanting and all that or taking

1905
01:12:25,039 --> 01:12:28,319
more care of the mothers or taking more

1906
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:30,000
care of the young plants so

1907
01:12:28,319 --> 01:12:31,279
if people can stay on the path for

1908
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:33,600
longer until they get really good then

1909
01:12:31,279 --> 01:12:36,960
they can train someone else

1910
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:39,039
but yeah so we also have a

1911
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:40,640
weekly pass report and stuff like that

1912
01:12:39,039 --> 01:12:42,399
too so

1913
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:44,560
i know there's some room that if uh

1914
01:12:42,399 --> 01:12:45,439
there's potential trips or spider mites

1915
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:50,000
and stuff like that

1916
01:12:45,439 --> 01:12:52,479
i'm not gonna go in there and um

1917
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:53,439
go to another room and get a little bit

1918
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:55,279
of some

1919
01:12:53,439 --> 01:12:57,279
potential fast issues today the

1920
01:12:55,279 --> 01:13:00,800
greenhouse we didn't went in there so we

1921
01:12:57,279 --> 01:13:01,439
stayed in the clean room we also moved

1922
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:03,520
from

1923
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:04,639
uh the youngest room to the oldest room

1924
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:06,640
as well instead of like

1925
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:08,960
starting to a room that's just about to

1926
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:11,440
be harvested and then people in a young

1927
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:13,359
young room that's just clean and

1928
01:13:11,439 --> 01:13:15,839
pristine so this is why we

1929
01:13:13,359 --> 01:13:17,198
did this we're this way as well today

1930
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:18,000
that makes a lot of sense yeah thanks

1931
01:13:17,198 --> 01:13:19,279
for explaining that

1932
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:21,840
so where what are we looking at right

1933
01:13:19,279 --> 01:13:24,960
now right now you're looking at

1934
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:26,400
uh some of the vertical algorithms so

1935
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:26,960
this is the process we're throwing in

1936
01:13:26,399 --> 01:13:33,839
here for

1937
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:33,840
cbd extraction uh

1938
01:13:39,270 --> 01:13:42,349
[Music]

1939
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:48,480
it's uh it's one that we really selected

1940
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:50,000
for biomass

1941
01:13:48,479 --> 01:13:52,158
i don't know if you can see very well

1942
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:55,198
next to it

1943
01:13:52,158 --> 01:13:56,000
yeah that's cool you know this is the

1944
01:13:55,198 --> 01:13:59,919
first

1945
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:00,560
vertically integrated living soil system

1946
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:02,319
yeah

1947
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:04,159
i've never actually seen on a commercial

1948
01:14:02,319 --> 01:14:05,920
scale yeah

1949
01:14:04,158 --> 01:14:07,599
a little access card is the size of your

1950
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:09,600
credit card uh

1951
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:10,800
i got big fat sausage figures so

1952
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:12,079
sometimes it puts things out of

1953
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:14,480
perspective

1954
01:14:12,079 --> 01:14:15,840
but this one is uh yeah it's really good

1955
01:14:14,479 --> 01:14:17,919
and this is not like

1956
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:19,520
necessarily desirable for smoking and

1957
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:21,840
all that but as far as biomass go

1958
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:23,360
for extraction it's kind of a loose open

1959
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:25,520
flour dries fast

1960
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:27,519
there's a good cbd content it mills very

1961
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:28,719
easily so for extractions that pinot's

1962
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:30,480
been like awesome

1963
01:14:28,719 --> 01:14:32,319
the other thing with this what's that

1964
01:14:30,479 --> 01:14:35,119
cultivar before you move on

1965
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:37,039
does it happen charlotte angel it's from

1966
01:14:35,119 --> 01:14:40,880
dutch fashion

1967
01:14:37,039 --> 01:14:42,479
cool yeah so and the other thing that

1968
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:44,560
tyler if you can take just a step back

1969
01:14:42,479 --> 01:14:46,479
that we have in here uh

1970
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:48,320
this system here this is how we've edged

1971
01:14:46,479 --> 01:14:50,399
plants but this is uh

1972
01:14:48,319 --> 01:14:52,479
mobile so the lights and irrigation is

1973
01:14:50,399 --> 01:14:53,039
stationary but it's all right we can

1974
01:14:52,479 --> 01:14:55,439
take it

1975
01:14:53,039 --> 01:14:56,158
wheel it to the harvest area or wheel it

1976
01:14:55,439 --> 01:14:58,079
to

1977
01:14:56,158 --> 01:15:00,079
uh whenever plant and veg we live to

1978
01:14:58,079 --> 01:15:02,079
your place where uh

1979
01:15:00,079 --> 01:15:03,679
we take 200 plants at a time and they're

1980
01:15:02,079 --> 01:15:04,319
going to get transplanted in greenhouse

1981
01:15:03,679 --> 01:15:06,000
so this is

1982
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:08,559
another thing that we work with with

1983
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:10,800
fluence but also

1984
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:12,400
bob hoffman from shenandoah growers

1985
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:13,520
which are the largest commercial ever

1986
01:15:12,399 --> 01:15:16,479
producer

1987
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:17,600
uh in the states we grow organic basil

1988
01:15:16,479 --> 01:15:19,839
and the bus butter stuff

1989
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:21,039
came up with this system and bob's been

1990
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:22,840
a pioneer in the

1991
01:15:21,039 --> 01:15:25,359
horticulture and greenhouse in the

1992
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:28,000
innovation

1993
01:15:25,359 --> 01:15:29,439
he knows more about information more

1994
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,319
about agriculture they'll ever know

1995
01:15:29,439 --> 01:15:32,799
probably but

1996
01:15:30,319 --> 01:15:33,679
that's one of the really neat little

1997
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:35,920
things

1998
01:15:33,679 --> 01:15:39,840
that was not that expensive but really

1999
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:39,840
increased workforce

2000
01:15:40,079 --> 01:15:42,640
very cool

2001
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:52,380
so this room has been in a two-level

2002
01:15:46,079 --> 01:15:59,948
room for sparring

2003
01:15:52,380 --> 01:15:59,949
[Music]

2004
01:16:01,119 --> 01:16:04,880
right now but this is what we were

2005
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:07,440
seeing earlier today

2006
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:08,079
before people just come in here if they

2007
01:16:07,439 --> 01:16:09,599
did

2008
01:16:08,079 --> 01:16:11,439
and we will especially if we know it

2009
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:13,120
could be an explanation

2010
01:16:11,439 --> 01:16:14,799
yeah what size are those plants in terms

2011
01:16:13,119 --> 01:16:15,599
of the container size that they're in so

2012
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:18,719
you're vegging

2013
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:20,719
in your abigail don't want to

2014
01:16:18,719 --> 01:16:22,640
get a little a little bigger than we

2015
01:16:20,719 --> 01:16:23,119
wanted to but it's been in there for

2016
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:25,360
about

2017
01:16:23,119 --> 01:16:27,279
three weeks now i'd say uh they want to

2018
01:16:25,359 --> 01:16:29,198
get out of there absolutely a bit longer

2019
01:16:27,279 --> 01:16:30,399
than when we ideally want and that goes

2020
01:16:29,198 --> 01:16:33,439
back into my

2021
01:16:30,399 --> 01:16:36,399
my timing question uh sending comments

2022
01:16:33,439 --> 01:16:37,039
uh earlier uh but we see like a super

2023
01:16:36,399 --> 01:16:39,839
beautiful

2024
01:16:37,039 --> 01:16:40,960
uh recovery of those clones so when

2025
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:43,119
everything is right

2026
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:44,960
10 12 days after we transplant them to

2027
01:16:43,119 --> 01:16:47,039
clones they're like

2028
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:48,158
the roots have only did one to turn into

2029
01:16:47,039 --> 01:16:52,880
pots and they're

2030
01:16:48,158 --> 01:16:52,879
going in 16 18 days dearly

2031
01:16:56,238 --> 01:17:00,718
cool dylan's asking what the capital

2032
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:02,960
expense was for this facility

2033
01:17:00,719 --> 01:17:04,960
i'm kind of curious about that too is

2034
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:06,880
that something that's public

2035
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:08,640
uh yeah it's gonna public information i

2036
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:13,199
think uh

2037
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:16,960
uh tomorrow last night

2038
01:17:13,198 --> 01:17:18,238
70 million i said 70 million

2039
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:19,840
yeah there's a lot of processing and

2040
01:17:18,238 --> 01:17:21,439
packaging stuff that we're done touching

2041
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:23,760
and that's that

2042
01:17:21,439 --> 01:17:26,479
and that was so there's no driving room

2043
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:28,159
there's the new driving technologies

2044
01:17:26,479 --> 01:17:30,959
we're trying to install continuous

2045
01:17:28,158 --> 01:17:34,000
drying lines too using vacuum

2046
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:36,319
uh there is no packaging so basically we

2047
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,840
start everything from easier and we do

2048
01:17:36,319 --> 01:17:39,759
the final packaging

2049
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:41,119
that's going to get shipped so there's a

2050
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:43,039
lot of infrastructure that's built

2051
01:17:41,119 --> 01:17:46,399
around that it is more than just

2052
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:48,000
growing and drying and selling involved

2053
01:17:46,399 --> 01:17:50,559
trying to be as integrated as possible

2054
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:54,800
for the whole entire process

2055
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:56,719
yeah and uh one other random question uh

2056
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:59,199
those those fluency lights put out 800

2057
01:17:56,719 --> 01:18:01,520
ppfd but what are your targets for veg

2058
01:17:59,198 --> 01:18:05,279
and flower in terms of uh

2059
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:07,199
in terms of lighting uh

2060
01:18:05,279 --> 01:18:09,198
so in a very sunny day in the summer in

2061
01:18:07,198 --> 01:18:12,879
the greenhouse

2062
01:18:09,198 --> 01:18:14,000
just natural light can be get up to 1600

2063
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:15,760
cpfc

2064
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:17,679
and this year was really interesting

2065
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:18,880
because uh i've closed it there was no

2066
01:18:17,679 --> 01:18:21,600
traffic on the road

2067
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:23,279
so we just used highlight levels in

2068
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:25,039
april because the air was so clean there

2069
01:18:23,279 --> 01:18:26,079
was no suspended particles in the air so

2070
01:18:25,039 --> 01:18:28,238
we've got really cool

2071
01:18:26,079 --> 01:18:29,679
really clean lights this year and i was

2072
01:18:28,238 --> 01:18:32,079
interested that we've seen

2073
01:18:29,679 --> 01:18:33,600
uh so we can go all the way up there so

2074
01:18:32,079 --> 01:18:33,920
of course we're not turning the lights

2075
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:36,880
on

2076
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:37,679
when we have like 1500 epson extra light

2077
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:38,640
but this is not

2078
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:41,719
also powered

2079
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:41,719
[Music]

2080
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:51,199
okay so you're aiming for a thousand to

2081
01:18:50,158 --> 01:18:52,479
twelve hundred

2082
01:18:51,198 --> 01:18:53,678
your lights can provide up to eight

2083
01:18:52,479 --> 01:18:54,718
hundred so you're counting on the

2084
01:18:53,679 --> 01:18:57,840
sunlight providing

2085
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:59,760
at least 400 per day

2086
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:01,440
when there when everything's opened up

2087
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:03,039
yeah and how

2088
01:19:01,439 --> 01:19:05,599
we're moving toward daylight and the

2089
01:19:03,039 --> 01:19:05,600
girl as well

2090
01:19:06,319 --> 01:19:09,679
it's more measure of the life

2091
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:12,880
attenuation just

2092
01:19:09,679 --> 01:19:15,279
one time the planet can take maybe into

2093
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:17,840
2000 maybe if you're light but for half

2094
01:19:15,279 --> 01:19:20,079
an hour to an hour if it's cold in that

2095
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:23,840
and it gets stretched so if you can have

2096
01:19:20,079 --> 01:19:23,840
like syria

2097
01:19:25,198 --> 01:19:28,399
so you're looking at how much light

2098
01:19:26,158 --> 01:19:29,439
they're receiving over a given period of

2099
01:19:28,399 --> 01:19:36,319
time or daylight

2100
01:19:29,439 --> 01:19:37,599
daylight interval yeah

2101
01:19:36,319 --> 01:19:39,759
yeah so your lighting company helps you

2102
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:41,760
with calculations and all that stuff

2103
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:43,440
which is an important thing to point out

2104
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:44,000
that's great if you're using a light

2105
01:19:43,439 --> 01:19:46,238
company

2106
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:47,039
like the product itself is great but the

2107
01:19:46,238 --> 01:19:51,839
warranties

2108
01:19:47,039 --> 01:19:51,840
and the customer service

2109

[Music]

2110
01:20:09,439 --> 01:20:12,479
yeah so your lighting company should

2111
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:14,400
also help you with your layout

2112
01:20:12,479 --> 01:20:15,599
uh based on the their knowledge of the

2113
01:20:14,399 --> 01:20:16,960
lighting they should help with

2114
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:18,000
calculating out a lot of this stuff

2115
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:20,880
they'll be able to tell you

2116
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:22,158
what light levels you'll receive um

2117
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:23,760
under this layout

2118
01:20:22,158 --> 01:20:24,799
so you you don't have to do that work

2119
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:26,320
and a lot of times they'll even help

2120
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:26,880
with the rebates and stuff with your

2121
01:20:26,319 --> 01:20:29,519
local

2122
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:33,840
uh state and county rebate stuff so

2123
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:33,840
that's important

2124
01:20:35,439 --> 01:20:39,759
yeah and then how large is the facility

2125
01:20:38,479 --> 01:20:46,638
overall what's your

2126
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:48,880
square footage about uh

2127
01:20:46,639 --> 01:20:48,880
wow

2128
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:52,800
cool i'll let you continue on yeah well

2129
01:20:52,399 --> 01:20:56,559
that's

2130
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:57,279
uh mostly it for now for the grow and

2131
01:20:56,560 --> 01:21:00,400
all that

2132
01:20:57,279 --> 01:21:00,399
there's the propagation

2133
01:21:06,569 --> 01:21:11,439
[Music]

2134
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:12,480
well you know i think that was uh i

2135
01:21:11,439 --> 01:21:14,000
think that was pretty good that was a

2136
01:21:12,479 --> 01:21:16,000
wonderful tour it's great to see the

2137
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,719
facility and i hope to make it up there

2138
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,479
someday and

2139
01:21:16,719 --> 01:21:20,158
i know you're constantly learning and

2140
01:21:18,479 --> 01:21:22,479
innovating and

2141
01:21:20,158 --> 01:21:24,479
uh one thing i'd be curious about is to

2142
01:21:22,479 --> 01:21:26,799
hear what sort of uh plans you guys have

2143
01:21:24,479 --> 01:21:28,718
with the research that you are doing

2144
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:30,480
how much of that is going to potentially

2145
01:21:28,719 --> 01:21:30,960
be published or is that all staying in

2146
01:21:30,479 --> 01:21:33,039
house

2147
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:35,520
or uh are you guys running a lot of

2148
01:21:33,039 --> 01:21:37,519
trials these days

2149
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:39,520
yeah we're we're running a lot of trials

2150
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:42,080
on different things and stuff uh

2151
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:43,520
so are we can you hear me right now we

2152
01:21:42,079 --> 01:21:44,319
can hear you great in here actually this

2153
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:46,719
is the best game

2154
01:21:44,319 --> 01:21:48,399
perfect yeah so yeah we're running a lot

2155
01:21:46,719 --> 01:21:51,600
of trial but it's all internal

2156
01:21:48,399 --> 01:21:54,719
and uh it's good to

2157
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:54,719
share with other uh

2158
01:21:55,119 --> 01:21:58,399
and like i foreign believe that with

2159
01:21:56,800 --> 01:22:00,880
sharing we everybody does better and we

2160
01:21:58,399 --> 01:22:00,879
learn more

2161
01:22:03,439 --> 01:22:06,638
but as as nothing planned so far we

2162
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:08,239
don't have uh

2163
01:22:06,639 --> 01:22:10,159
research or university partners yet

2164
01:22:08,238 --> 01:22:13,678
we're in talk some of them uh

2165
01:22:10,158 --> 01:22:15,839
but it's been uh uh yeah

2166
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:17,440
as far as like as and also as

2167
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:18,560
competitive things are getting to i know

2168
01:22:17,439 --> 01:22:20,559
there's really other

2169
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:22,320
uh canadian organic greenhouse producers

2170
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:23,120
that are listening here and we're all

2171
01:22:22,319 --> 01:22:24,639
like

2172
01:22:23,119 --> 01:22:26,639
doing our old things and all that is a

2173
01:22:24,639 --> 01:22:30,079
bit of a professional secret

2174
01:22:26,639 --> 01:22:31,199
that's going on here there too so

2175
01:22:30,079 --> 01:22:33,679
there's a bit of all of that but it's

2176
01:22:31,198 --> 01:22:37,039
still uh it's still ag and

2177
01:22:33,679 --> 01:22:38,000
uh renaults management and all that too

2178
01:22:37,039 --> 01:22:41,279
so we have a really awesome

2179
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:42,800
beautiful facility and uh we're learning

2180
01:22:41,279 --> 01:22:46,000
how to work with it

2181
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:47,520
a lot it's some really really good good

2182
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:50,238
stuff more than

2183
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:50,719
we want to publish a lot of stuff i'm

2184
01:22:50,238 --> 01:22:52,479
also

2185
01:22:50,719 --> 01:22:54,158
an internship program another stuff like

2186
01:22:52,479 --> 01:22:56,079
that uh

2187
01:22:54,158 --> 01:22:57,839
we've hired a lot of uh there's advice

2188

here we have our students coming out

2191
01:23:00,479 --> 01:23:02,718
there

2192
01:23:03,279 --> 01:23:07,039
i'm lizzy david a little bit louder

2193
01:23:06,158 --> 01:23:08,399
sorry

2194
01:23:07,039 --> 01:23:10,560
yes sir it's going to use learning

2195
01:23:08,399 --> 01:23:12,960
opportunities for us we're

2196
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:14,400
hiring uh people that are coming from

2197
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:17,119
the research side that have a good

2198
01:23:14,399 --> 01:23:18,719
mexican strong background but we haven't

2199
01:23:17,119 --> 01:23:22,319
published anything yet

2200
01:23:18,719 --> 01:23:24,239
ourselves yet okay

2201
01:23:22,319 --> 01:23:26,559
wonderful um i'll let you do the

2202
01:23:24,238 --> 01:23:27,759
publishing part that

2203
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:29,679
we're working on we're trying to come up

2204
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:31,280
with some research too you know i think

2205
01:23:29,679 --> 01:23:32,000
that's uh i think that's important part

2206
01:23:31,279 --> 01:23:33,840
of the process

2207
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:35,439
as you know and and i appreciate my

2208
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:37,199
conversations with you and even you just

2209
01:23:35,439 --> 01:23:38,638
opening up the facility to let us tour

2210
01:23:37,198 --> 01:23:40,879
it i think is a big deal

2211
01:23:38,639 --> 01:23:43,440
i know a lot of facilities uh aren't

2212
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:46,239
open to that especially on your scale so

2213
01:23:43,439 --> 01:23:47,439
i think it's great um good we're proud

2214
01:23:46,238 --> 01:23:49,119
about what we're doing we're excited

2215
01:23:47,439 --> 01:23:50,638
about it and we're

2216
01:23:49,119 --> 01:23:52,479
learning a lot and that's what keeps us

2217
01:23:50,639 --> 01:23:55,520
engaged so that's the

2218
01:23:52,479 --> 01:23:56,799
that's part of the the love-hate

2219
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:58,800
relationship with

2220
01:23:56,800 --> 01:24:00,560
agriculture sometimes but it's mostly

2221
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:02,159
been treating us very well so far and

2222
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:04,000
super exciting

2223
01:24:02,158 --> 01:24:05,679
what we're coming up with this fall this

2224
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:09,198
winter is going to be

2225
01:24:05,679 --> 01:24:10,880
really awesome cool uh so one other

2226
01:24:09,198 --> 01:24:12,319
question i had on here from guy

2227
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:14,159
that i thought was a great question he's

2228
01:24:12,319 --> 01:24:16,719
in new zealand uh lucky

2229
01:24:14,158 --> 01:24:17,839
lucky him uh during the process of the

2230
01:24:16,719 --> 01:24:19,439
design

2231
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:21,119
what is the one thing that you had to go

2232
01:24:19,439 --> 01:24:22,719
back and retrospectively change

2233
01:24:21,119 --> 01:24:24,639
increase to actually meet your demands

2234
01:24:22,719 --> 01:24:26,079
or needs was there any one thing

2235
01:24:24,639 --> 01:24:27,520
if you could go back and wave a magic

2236
01:24:26,079 --> 01:24:28,880
wand you'd say oh this is something i

2237
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:31,040
wish i'd done or

2238
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:32,960
hadn't there's something i wish i hadn't

2239
01:24:31,039 --> 01:24:37,039
done videos

2240
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:37,039
and cooling capacity you should always

2241
01:24:38,158 --> 01:24:41,279
over build a little bit on that if you

2242
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:44,800
can you're never going to have

2243
01:24:41,279 --> 01:24:48,238
too much uh and power

2244
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:50,239
or keep in mind like the general

2245
01:24:48,238 --> 01:24:52,319
small day-to-day functionality as well

2246
01:24:50,238 --> 01:24:54,959
because you're you're going to rely on

2247
01:24:52,319 --> 01:24:56,399
this scale with a lot of uh growers and

2248
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:58,319
tables and you may get better you need

2249
01:24:56,399 --> 01:24:59,519
to make a facility functional for them

2250
01:24:58,319 --> 01:25:01,359
for what you're going to do with your

2251
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:03,600
groceries so that thing can make you

2252
01:25:01,359 --> 01:25:03,599
grow

2253
01:25:04,238 --> 01:25:10,000
flexible or don't max out the product

2254
01:25:08,319 --> 01:25:11,759
you need to buy your powers of

2255
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:13,840
hardest things so it's like oh you're

2256
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:17,360
going to need 19 megawatts a month

2257
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:18,960
but you buy or you build for uh

2258
01:25:17,359 --> 01:25:20,319
like you know the half and then future

2259
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:20,560
expansion if you want to change things

2260
01:25:20,319 --> 01:25:22,399
and

2261
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:24,880
your secondary good thing about the

2262
01:25:22,399 --> 01:25:29,119
immediate part of it but also one thing

2263
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:30,880
coming up eventually

2264
01:25:29,119 --> 01:25:34,399
yeah change a few things but nothing

2265
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:34,400
dramatic nothing that's crazy

2266
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:40,080
all right and then my very last question

2267
01:25:39,198 --> 01:25:41,919
what's it like

2268
01:25:40,079 --> 01:25:43,279
growing this much cannabis and being the

2269
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:45,679
world leading organic

2270
01:25:43,279 --> 01:25:47,759
uh you know cannabis grower on the on

2271
01:25:45,679 --> 01:25:50,239
these on this indoor facility or hybrid

2272
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:50,239
facility

2273
01:25:53,039 --> 01:25:56,079
here for the last uh months and it's

2274
01:25:54,960 --> 01:26:00,079
been awesome

2275
01:25:56,079 --> 01:26:04,319
uh so much to learn about growing and

2276
01:26:00,079 --> 01:26:08,880
other stuff it's been a very spiritual

2277
01:26:04,319 --> 01:26:08,880
innovation and

2278
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:18,800
innovation that we're doing in this

2279
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:19,760
large-scale market cannabis has been an

2280
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:22,079
amazing

2281
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:26,739
driver for uh

2282
01:26:22,079 --> 01:26:26,738
[Music]

2283
01:26:35,039 --> 01:26:38,719
ripple effect in the rest of the world

2284
01:26:36,719 --> 01:26:43,600
to better everything

2285
01:26:38,719 --> 01:26:43,600
uh that's when it's really awesome

2286
01:26:45,039 --> 01:26:51,840
so just uh

2287
01:27:01,198 --> 01:27:06,079
yeah it's a ton of work but uh i mean

2288
01:27:04,238 --> 01:27:08,559
i think it's amazing it's no longer a

2289
01:27:06,079 --> 01:27:10,880
proof of concept this idea that we can

2290
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:12,080
reuse soils in a controlled environment

2291
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:14,400
agriculture

2292
01:27:12,079 --> 01:27:14,399
this is

2293
01:27:17,279 --> 01:27:21,279
i uh we do it this way and we have to

2294
01:27:20,158 --> 01:27:24,559
give up these tools

2295
01:27:21,279 --> 01:27:24,559
that's what's really impossible

2296
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:35,360
together

2297
01:27:33,679 --> 01:27:37,679
yeah and the just the highlight for

2298
01:27:35,359 --> 01:27:38,479
listeners the idea behind this is that

2299
01:27:37,679 --> 01:27:41,520
by not

2300
01:27:38,479 --> 01:27:43,678
by reusing the soil that allows uh

2301
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:45,199
like a company like t-god to not have

2302
01:27:43,679 --> 01:27:47,359
the labor of moving

2303
01:27:45,198 --> 01:27:49,039
a massive amount of media in and out of

2304
01:27:47,359 --> 01:27:50,880
facility they're not utilizing something

2305
01:27:49,039 --> 01:27:52,319
like rockwool which is not sustainable

2306
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:53,600
and actually quite damaging to the

2307
01:27:52,319 --> 01:27:55,439
environment

2308
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:56,960
and also so not only are they reducing

2309
01:27:55,439 --> 01:27:58,000
their labor but also their cost for

2310
01:27:56,960 --> 01:28:00,560
fertility the

2311
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:01,439
amount of inputs that they're using for

2312
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:04,560
fertilization

2313
01:28:01,439 --> 01:28:06,799
is so much lower than more traditional

2314
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:09,679
methods of cultivating cannabis so

2315
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:11,039
uh yes it's a it's a tough concept it's

2316
01:28:09,679 --> 01:28:12,880
a lot of work what they're doing but

2317
01:28:11,039 --> 01:28:15,519
overall it's saving them a ton of money

2318
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:16,719
and a ton of labor and uh is much much

2319
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:18,320
more sustainable than

2320
01:28:16,719 --> 01:28:20,319
the more conventional models that you've

2321
01:28:18,319 --> 01:28:21,920
seen out there so i commend you guys for

2322
01:28:20,319 --> 01:28:24,000
pulling it off

2323
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:26,239
well it's been like we have a really

2324
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:28,158
awesome community
