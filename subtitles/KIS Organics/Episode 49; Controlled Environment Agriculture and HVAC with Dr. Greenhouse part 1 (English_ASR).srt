welcome to the cannabis cultivation and

3
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,100
science podcast

4
00:00:21,149 --> 00:00:25,229
I'm your host CAD Hussey of KISS

5
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,118
organics this is the podcast where we

6
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,890
discuss the cutting edge of organic

7
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:30,839
growing from a science-based perspective

8
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,279
and drawn top experts from around the

9
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:34,679
industry to share their wisdom and

10
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,870
knowledge before I start the podcast I

11
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:38,549
wanted to share some exciting news first

12
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:40,229
and foremost I'm thrilled to be

13
00:00:38,549 --> 00:00:42,419
welcoming a baby girl into our farm

14
00:00:40,229 --> 00:00:44,218
family we are expecting in November and

15
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,629
I will do my best to keep up the podcast

16
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:46,950
schedule but there's a lot going on so

17
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:49,079
please be patient with me

18
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:51,090
in other news I've been working with

19
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:52,679
Nathan Gibbs and dr. Ben Higgins from

20
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,600
gold leaf gardens on a few different

21
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:56,369
trials ranging from mammoth pea to blue

22
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,020
mats I'm hoping to get the data back

23
00:00:56,369 --> 00:00:59,459
soon on the blue mat versus hand

24
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,680
watering trials they've been running in

25
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,120
the facility and we'll share it soon Ben

26
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:05,400
is also helping me with the blue mat

27
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:06,840
designs for beds and facilities so shoot

28
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,340
me an email if you're interested in

29
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,010
trying out blue mats for your growing

30
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:13,260
setup for this week's podcast though I

31
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:15,960
had the honor of interviewing dr. Nadia

32
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:18,270
Saba who also known as dr. greenhouse

33
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:20,728
she is the president and founder of dr.

34
00:01:18,269 --> 00:01:22,709
greenhouse an agricultural mechanical

35
00:01:20,728 --> 00:01:25,049
engineering firm that specializes in the

36
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:28,079
design of HVAC systems for indoor plant

37
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:29,579
environments dr. Saba has her PhD in

38
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:31,349
agricultural engineering from the

39
00:01:29,578 --> 00:01:33,959
University of Arizona's controlled

40
00:01:31,349 --> 00:01:35,849
environment agricultural center and is a

41
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:37,978
licensed mechanical engineer in the

42
00:01:35,849 --> 00:01:39,989
state of California for over 20 years

43
00:01:37,978 --> 00:01:41,909
she has dedicated her education and

44
00:01:39,989 --> 00:01:43,438
career to helping farmers control their

45
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:45,960
environments allowing them to grow crops

46
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:47,639
indoors in greenhouses and in facilities

47
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:52,250
that otherwise would be impossible or

48
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,250
impractical to do so now on to the show

49
00:01:53,129 --> 00:01:59,019
hey Nadia thanks for coming on the show

50
00:01:55,239 --> 00:02:00,250
today thanks for having me yeah let's

51
00:01:59,019 --> 00:02:03,459
start off by telling listeners a little

52
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:05,980
bit about your personal journey and how

53
00:02:03,459 --> 00:02:08,109
you ended up doing what you do now for a

54
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:12,849
living yeah sure

55
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:14,800
so I have been studying and researching

56
00:02:12,849 --> 00:02:18,280
and working in controlled environment

57
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:21,750
agriculture for about 21 years now when

58
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:25,390
I was in undergraduate at UC Davis I

59
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:28,360
worked on a mushroom farm in southern

60
00:02:25,389 --> 00:02:31,449
Idaho and this farmer was trying to grow

61
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:34,120
a talkie and oyster mushrooms in in

62
00:02:31,449 --> 00:02:38,649
greenhouses and basically the Nevada

63
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:43,569
climate and all summer we could not keep

64
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:46,270
the greenhouses humid enough to grow

65
00:02:43,569 --> 00:02:49,239
mushrooms and so we were constantly just

66
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:52,689
wetting down the floor and you know

67
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:55,540
sticking hoses up in the HAF fans just

68
00:02:52,689 --> 00:02:59,439
to try to get moisture into these

69
00:02:55,539 --> 00:03:01,709
greenhouses and while while working up

70
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:05,109
there I lived in a little 20 foot

71
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:07,810
trailer right on the farm and just fell

72
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:12,880
in love with farm life and agriculture

73
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:15,879
and in that process of trying to control

74
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:18,219
these greenhouses to create a good

75
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:20,979
environment for mushroom production I

76
00:03:18,219 --> 00:03:25,080
had my aha moment and decided that I

77
00:03:20,979 --> 00:03:29,379
wanted to help growers to help farmers

78
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:32,440
control their environment and so that

79
00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:34,959
was the summer of 1998 and ever since I

80
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:37,030
have been on the path to do just that

81
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,549
so I got my master's degree at Penn

82
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:41,830
State studying air circulation in

83
00:03:39,549 --> 00:03:44,250
mushroom production farms which I

84
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:46,660
consider the first vertical farm and

85
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:48,009
then I went on to get my PhD at the

86
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:49,419
University of Arizona in their

87
00:03:48,009 --> 00:03:51,939
controlled environment agriculture

88
00:03:49,419 --> 00:03:54,458
center where I said I studied

89
00:03:51,939 --> 00:03:57,699
evaporative cooling and ventilation and

90
00:03:54,459 --> 00:04:03,879
water use efficiency of commercial

91
00:03:57,699 --> 00:04:05,869
tomato production in greenhouses and and

92
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:09,709
after I got my pee

93
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:14,840
I decided you know I want to learn how

94
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:18,590
to be an engineer so I left academia to

95
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:20,290
the chagrin of especially my mom who did

96
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:23,119
not understand why would leave

97
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:25,910
agriculture and leave the prospects of

98
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,329
being a professor and teaching to go out

99
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:31,310
and get a job in mechanical engineering

100
00:04:28,329 --> 00:04:34,009
so that's what I did I got a job a real

101
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:37,970
job as a mechanic 'el designer and

102
00:04:34,009 --> 00:04:41,000
learned how to be an HVAC engineer so I

103
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:43,000
did that for about 10 years designing a

104
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,430
track systems for commercial buildings

105
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:50,600
high-rise residential buildings even

106
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:54,199
animal shelters became a big part of my

107
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:58,900
work and and then indoor agriculture

108
00:04:54,199 --> 00:05:03,050
started to take off people wanted to do

109
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:05,239
people wanted to grow lettuce and plants

110
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:08,560
in vertical farms and plant factories

111
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:13,038
and containers and at the same time

112
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:16,910
cannabis was becoming recreationally

113
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:20,899
legal in Colorado and Washington and so

114
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:23,450
people wanted to grow plants indoors

115
00:05:20,899 --> 00:05:27,228
regardless of whether it was you know

116
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:31,269
vegetables or or cannabis and medicine

117
00:05:27,228 --> 00:05:34,219
and so my two worlds collided

118
00:05:31,269 --> 00:05:40,788
agriculture and mechanical engineering

119
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:42,320
and I decided in 2017 I guess about two

120
00:05:40,788 --> 00:05:45,560
and a half years ago to start my own

121
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:51,918
company dr. greenhouse so that I could

122
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:57,050
live my dream and try to design HVAC

123
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:59,209
systems for indoor plant environment and

124
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:01,220
so that's what we specialize in using a

125
00:05:59,209 --> 00:06:04,029
track design floor controlled

126
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:06,740
environment agriculture both greenhouses

127
00:06:04,029 --> 00:06:08,750
warehouses vertical farms plants

128
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:11,090
factories containers it doesn't matter

129
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:13,189
what you grow or what type of building

130
00:06:11,089 --> 00:06:16,279
you grow it in we can help you control

131
00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:18,050
your environment better wow you have

132
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:19,638
quite a dynamic background I had no idea

133
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:21,620
I have to

134
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:24,848
the reason I reached out to you is

135
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:28,009
because I had multiple people including

136
00:06:24,848 --> 00:06:29,538
Allison Justice among others who said

137
00:06:28,009 --> 00:06:31,158
this is the person in the industry that

138
00:06:29,538 --> 00:06:32,628
you need to talk to when it comes to

139
00:06:31,158 --> 00:06:35,240
controlled environment agriculture and

140
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:37,879
HVAC so you've gotten a lot of accolades

141
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:39,408
from the people that I really respect in

142
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:42,590
the industry so I'm honored that your

143
00:06:39,408 --> 00:06:44,629
your on the show here and I wanted to

144
00:06:42,589 --> 00:06:48,739
start off sort of talking about some of

145
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:50,240
the goals of HVAC er controlled

146
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:53,150
environment agriculture in terms of

147
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,430
looking at the the main goals of

148
00:06:53,149 --> 00:06:58,128
controlling the environment obviously

149
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:59,900
air movement and odor control as being

150
00:06:58,129 --> 00:07:02,479
the three that I sort this we're sort of

151
00:06:59,899 --> 00:07:04,489
highlighted in my head what do you see

152
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:07,008
as sort of the the goals when you step

153
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:08,590
into a facility what is kind of going

154
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:12,560
through your head and in terms of this

155
00:07:08,589 --> 00:07:15,709
yeah sure so HVAC specifically is an

156
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:18,968
acronym for heating ventilation and air

157
00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:23,299
conditioning and really it's about

158
00:07:18,968 --> 00:07:27,199
controlling the the climate right the

159
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:30,560
the airs environment that's around

160
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:34,430
people as well as as plants and other

161
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:36,468
living organisms and for an indoor plant

162
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:42,528
environment what we're really trying to

163
00:07:36,468 --> 00:07:45,468
do is kind of a two-pronged design or

164
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:47,750
control set of controlled parameters one

165
00:07:45,468 --> 00:07:53,240
is deployment itself so we're trying to

166
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:56,120
control temperature and humidity and and

167
00:07:53,240 --> 00:08:02,838
the vapor pressure deficit and in order

168
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:04,759
to control the plants responses to the

169
00:08:02,838 --> 00:08:07,430
temperature and humidity in the space

170
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:10,310
which affects you know transpiration

171
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:12,740
rate photosynthetic rates and metabolic

172
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:16,180
rates of the plant and so the general

173
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:18,710
health and growth of that of your crop

174
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:21,319
but in addition to just you know

175
00:08:18,709 --> 00:08:24,049
temperature and humidity we're also

176
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:27,319
trying to control the air quality and

177
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:32,799
the quality includes things like carbon

178
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:35,740
dioxide and and odor and VOCs

179
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:40,509
as well as the movement of the air

180
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:43,538
around the plant and pathogens so the

181
00:08:40,509 --> 00:08:49,088
particles basically write the the things

182
00:08:43,538 --> 00:08:51,909
that are actually inside the air that's

183
00:08:49,089 --> 00:08:53,649
around your plant and so HVAC we're

184
00:08:51,909 --> 00:08:56,289
controlling temperature and humidity and

185
00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:59,500
that climate as well as the air quality

186
00:08:56,289 --> 00:09:01,778
that's surrounding your plant and all of

187
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:07,929
that relates to the health and

188
00:09:01,778 --> 00:09:10,870
productivity of the crop and of your

189
00:09:07,929 --> 00:09:14,259
final product and and how quickly that

190
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:16,600
product grows so it's both yield as well

191
00:09:14,259 --> 00:09:20,319
as some of quality characteristics I

192
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:22,480
realize it's a very complex topic which

193
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,690
is why we have to hire experts like you

194
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,278
to come in and assist I guess what I'm

195
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:29,290
what I'm wondering is so what would be

196
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:31,419
some of the challenges just starting off

197
00:09:29,289 --> 00:09:36,399
with for a basic home grower let's say I

198
00:09:31,419 --> 00:09:39,849
had and 4x4 and 8x4 tent you know and I

199
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:42,940
want to set up a small little grow room

200
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:44,620
in inside of another room the way I was

201
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:46,839
always taught was you want to have a fan

202
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:48,639
you know let's just say a six six inch

203
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:51,790
in-line ducting fan this is back in the

204
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:55,019
day when we had single ended air-cooled

205
00:09:51,789 --> 00:09:57,610
hoods and I would run negative pressure

206
00:09:55,019 --> 00:10:00,220
by pulling pulling the air out of the

207
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:03,610
room and through a carbon filter in the

208
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:05,259
process what would you look look this

209
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:07,300
out if you know on the small scale for

210
00:10:05,259 --> 00:10:08,708
the home grown listeners what sort of

211
00:10:07,299 --> 00:10:11,919
tips and pointers might you have along

212
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:13,809
those lines yeah I mean I think that you

213
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:16,349
know regardless of what scale that

214
00:10:13,809 --> 00:10:19,088
you're growing out whether it's small or

215
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:22,110
medium or its commercial large scale

216
00:10:19,089 --> 00:10:24,970
that really the parameters are the same

217
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:26,528
but the scale is a little bit different

218
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:30,940
and so when you when you're setting up a

219
00:10:26,528 --> 00:10:35,169
smaller grow you don't have as many

220
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:37,930
inputs from from the light from the

221
00:10:35,169 --> 00:10:40,059
plants from the irrigation system or

222
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:42,219
even from you know the surrounding

223
00:10:40,059 --> 00:10:45,429
environment if you are say in a tenth

224
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:48,730
grow or if you're in your garage

225
00:10:45,429 --> 00:10:50,669
you have a lot fewer variables well you

226
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:53,740
have the same variables but you have

227
00:10:50,669 --> 00:10:55,929
less intensity of them I guess you could

228
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:59,830
say so you know if you have six plants

229
00:10:55,929 --> 00:11:02,469
for one high pressure sodium lamp you

230
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:03,639
know it's very easy to document the

231
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:06,040
amount of heat that's going to be

232
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:08,769
generated by that lamp you have a small

233
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:10,779
you know wall area so you don't have to

234
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:13,809
worry too much about what's going on

235
00:11:10,779 --> 00:11:16,059
outside and your plants are getting a

236
00:11:13,809 --> 00:11:21,339
certain amount of water that that you

237
00:11:16,059 --> 00:11:23,859
are controlling you know very regularly

238
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:25,660
and you probably know exactly how often

239
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:27,820
you're watering and how much your plants

240
00:11:25,659 --> 00:11:30,009
are using and you can touch and feel the

241
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:32,320
soil to know when they need to be

242
00:11:30,009 --> 00:11:34,809
watered next and so for those you know

243
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:38,320
smaller facilities

244
00:11:34,809 --> 00:11:40,750
you know those small home grows you know

245
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,010
the HR equipment that you can use to

246
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:45,159
control the environment can be

247
00:11:42,009 --> 00:11:47,169
relatively simple right I mean it's

248
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:49,600
going to be if the air conditioner sinks

249
00:11:47,169 --> 00:11:53,709
just like a split system heat pump I see

250
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:56,259
this pretty commonly in home grows where

251
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:58,300
you just have you know like a condensing

252
00:11:56,259 --> 00:12:01,179
unit outside you have a fan coil unit

253
00:11:58,299 --> 00:12:04,209
inside and and it's and it's just enough

254
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:05,889
heat to or is just enough cooling to

255
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:08,379
remove the heat generated by the lights

256
00:12:05,889 --> 00:12:10,659
and maybe it's hot outside so it can do

257
00:12:08,379 --> 00:12:14,259
that too and then you might have you

258
00:12:10,659 --> 00:12:17,289
know one small dehumidifier in the space

259
00:12:14,259 --> 00:12:20,500
to remove the moisture that's being

260
00:12:17,289 --> 00:12:22,419
generated by the plants and and then you

261
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:24,399
have a fan right that's blowing air

262
00:12:22,419 --> 00:12:25,929
around the plant to make sure that

263
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:29,220
they're moving make sure that you're

264
00:12:25,929 --> 00:12:32,949
transferring you know the carbon dioxide

265
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:36,670
to the plants and also removing water

266
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:38,590
from transpiration heat away from the

267
00:12:36,669 --> 00:12:41,169
plant maybe from the radiation from

268
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:43,509
those lamps and you know you kind of

269
00:12:41,169 --> 00:12:46,209
need like one of everything right you

270
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:48,909
need one fan cooling unit one fan one

271
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:52,810
light one pump for irrigation or your

272
00:12:48,909 --> 00:12:56,319
hand turn one hose and in it's

273
00:12:52,809 --> 00:12:57,609
relatively simple but as you scale up it

274
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,200
gets a little bit more complicated

275
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:01,539
because the dynamic

276
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:05,800
get a little bit different now you have

277
00:13:01,539 --> 00:13:07,599
a larger roof say and their walls and so

278
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:10,959
the interaction with the outside

279
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:13,090
environment might be a lot greater and

280
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:15,700
now you have a lot of lights right so

281
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:19,810
let's say you went from 50 square feet

282
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:24,520
up to 500 square feet well now you have

283
00:13:19,809 --> 00:13:25,899
you know 10 times or maybe more the

284
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:28,539
number of lights than what you are used

285
00:13:25,899 --> 00:13:30,129
to and now you have more plants and

286
00:13:28,539 --> 00:13:33,759
you're watering them probably more

287
00:13:30,129 --> 00:13:36,669
frequently or in a different way maybe

288
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:39,220
you're using drip irrigation and maybe

289
00:13:36,669 --> 00:13:41,949
even like a rock wall type of system so

290
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:44,800
you have a more constant flow of water

291
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:47,710
and and now all of a sudden maybe one of

292
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:49,599
everything isn't enough at least if you

293
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:52,210
use the same system that you are used to

294
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:55,779
and so that I think becomes a real

295
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:58,330
challenge for growers who are scaling up

296
00:13:55,779 --> 00:14:00,279
is that they were used to a certain type

297
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:02,920
of system and used to a certain type of

298
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:05,529
setup that works very well but now as

299
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:07,779
you get into these bigger facilities you

300
00:14:05,529 --> 00:14:10,089
need to multiply everything and if you

301
00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:12,370
stick with the same type of system they

302
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:14,830
the same type of a track system now

303
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:17,980
maybe we have you know 10 fans and 10

304
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:19,770
fan coil units you know 10 little air

305
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:22,509
conditioners and that becomes a real

306
00:14:19,769 --> 00:14:24,669
maintenance challenge the other thing is

307
00:14:22,509 --> 00:14:26,769
that you know those those fans that you

308
00:14:24,669 --> 00:14:30,729
might have had sitting you know on your

309
00:14:26,769 --> 00:14:33,549
wall or a little floor stand fan that

310
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:35,409
can't reach very far right and in 50

311
00:14:33,549 --> 00:14:38,139
square feet it only has to maybe reach

312
00:14:35,409 --> 00:14:40,149
10 feet away right 10 feet by 5 feet

313
00:14:38,139 --> 00:14:43,779
maybe if you're have 50 square foot

314
00:14:40,149 --> 00:14:46,179
little little tent but now you're in you

315
00:14:43,779 --> 00:14:50,909
know 500 square feet and now it's 10 by

316
00:14:46,179 --> 00:14:54,309
50 and that fan can't blow 10 feet away

317
00:14:50,909 --> 00:14:56,319
or 50 feet away and so now you have to

318
00:14:54,309 --> 00:14:58,689
maybe think more about how am I going to

319
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,430
get air to the middle of the crop so

320
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:02,710
that the the plants in the middle can

321
00:15:00,429 --> 00:15:05,979
dance as well as the plant close to the

322
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:07,780
fans close to the walls and seeing what

323
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:10,210
the air conditioning system is you know

324
00:15:07,779 --> 00:15:12,459
I've been on the phone with the farmers

325
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:14,440
who who have these fan

326
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:17,070
cool units right neither are those

327
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:19,390
systems that are mounted on the wall and

328
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:20,830
they just have a little fan in them a

329
00:15:19,389 --> 00:15:22,449
little cooling coil and they're

330
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:25,060
circulating the air that's in the space

331
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:28,990
and you know sucking it out the bottom

332
00:15:25,059 --> 00:15:31,239
and then blowing it out the side cooler

333
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:33,220
drier air well now if you need you know

334
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:35,909
you could one of those and your tent was

335
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:38,470
great right like that's easy to maintain

336
00:15:35,909 --> 00:15:40,899
you know you can buy it at Home Depot no

337
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:43,840
problem pretty cheap but now think of

338
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:46,480
you have ten of these things in a space

339
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:49,870
all of a sudden it becomes kind of a

340
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:52,360
maintenance nightmare I was on the phone

341
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:55,000
with a with a farmer one time back east

342
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:57,909
and in Massachusetts he's like yeah you

343
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,830
know we inherited this facility and you

344
00:15:57,909 --> 00:16:02,049
know all of our grow rooms are 500

345
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:04,090
square feet and we have like 10 or 12 of

346
00:16:02,049 --> 00:16:06,609
these you know fan coil units on the

347
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:09,129
wall in every single room and so we have

348
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:11,889
like 180 of them total on the facility

349
00:16:09,129 --> 00:16:14,830
and they break down all the time I'm

350
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:17,889
constantly changing the fan motors or

351
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:21,280
you know the the little coil pumps on

352
00:16:17,889 --> 00:16:23,769
them and and they just become really

353
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:25,659
challenging if you try to scale up that

354
00:16:23,769 --> 00:16:29,169
same system that you are used to in a

355
00:16:25,659 --> 00:16:32,199
small grow but there are solutions where

356
00:16:29,169 --> 00:16:35,799
you could still do one system per 500

357
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:39,460
square foot or even one system poor for

358
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:42,519
2,000 square feet and these are you know

359
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:44,470
these are larger HVAC systems they can

360
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:49,449
be package systems that sit on the roof

361
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:51,310
or outside of the facility and it's it's

362
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:52,600
an all-in-one and now what you can do

363
00:16:51,309 --> 00:16:55,989
with that system is you can actually

364
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:58,060
duct air from them to now you stick you

365
00:16:55,990 --> 00:17:00,370
know a duct on the end of that and you

366
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:02,619
can blow that air over the top of the

367
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:05,529
canopy and rather than relying so

368
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:07,000
heavily on fans to move air around now

369
00:17:05,529 --> 00:17:08,859
you can use ducts they can either be

370
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,049
hard metal duct so they can be fabric

371
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:14,349
ducts and you can be strategic about

372
00:17:11,049 --> 00:17:17,889
blowing that conditioned air down over

373
00:17:14,349 --> 00:17:19,659
your crop wherever your plants are and

374
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:21,430
so that helps to solve some of the issue

375
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:24,430
with air distribution that you're going

376
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:26,950
to that you're going to

377
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:28,990
experience with the larger facility I

378
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:31,420
would say you know in general while I'm

379
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:34,150
on the topic of of air circulation that

380
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:38,170
is one of the biggest challenges and in

381
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:40,269
a very important pour for plants because

382
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:42,640
I had mentioned earlier that you know

383
00:17:40,269 --> 00:17:46,359
it's responsible for for taking away

384
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,980
that the heat and the moisture from the

385
00:17:46,359 --> 00:17:49,839
leaves and from the plant so that they

386
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:51,940
can continue to transpire and they don't

387
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:53,049
get too hot but also I mean you think

388
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:56,110
about I mean they're also going to

389
00:17:53,049 --> 00:17:57,879
deliver co2 to the plant right so the

390
00:17:56,109 --> 00:18:00,669
plants are generating oxygen they need

391
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:04,120
co2 to photosynthesize and so you know

392
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:08,680
moving air across the plants is really

393
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:11,679
important in an indoor facility and and

394
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:14,410
and when we get bigger it you know

395
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:16,750
bigger rooms it gets harder to move air

396
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:18,340
but also a lot of farmers are now going

397
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:21,309
vertical right they want to take more

398
00:18:18,339 --> 00:18:23,109
advantage of the vertical space in a

399
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:25,359
warehouse so rather than having rooms

400
00:18:23,109 --> 00:18:27,879
that are you know ten or twelve or

401
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:30,129
fourteen or sixteen feet tall now they

402
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:33,640
want to take full advantage of their 20

403
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:36,240
foot or 25 foot tall warehouse in double

404
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:39,370
stacking them and now when we talk about

405
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:41,109
vertically stacked plants now we're not

406
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:43,929
just having to deal with moving air

407
00:18:41,109 --> 00:18:47,129
horizontally now we have to move air you

408
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:50,920
know vertically right at multiple levels

409
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:54,100
and that's a more special challenge to

410
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:57,340
figure out how do I create even air

411
00:18:54,099 --> 00:19:00,819
movement left and right as well as from

412
00:18:57,339 --> 00:19:02,500
top to bottom so that you know those are

413
00:19:00,819 --> 00:19:04,720
sort of the chest some of the bigger

414
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:07,420
challenges associated with scaling so

415
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:10,210
starting with a small facility it can be

416
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:14,380
relatively simple stepping up into sort

417
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:17,590
of a medium sized facility is is

418
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:20,050
challenging but but maybe easier than

419
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:22,990
even getting into say a 10,000 square

420
00:19:20,049 --> 00:19:26,109
foot room or a 2,000 square foot room as

421
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:30,730
vertically stacked the big challenge

422
00:19:26,109 --> 00:19:33,459
becomes moving air and getting it out of

423
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:33,950
the space before that humidity and that

424
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:36,920
he

425
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:38,809
build up yeah you talk about air

426
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:40,640
circulation I think that is such a

427
00:19:38,809 --> 00:19:43,940
fascinating topic that I'm frankly

428
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:45,580
pretty ignorant on I do see an issue

429
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:48,529
though like you mentioned so you'll have

430
00:19:45,579 --> 00:19:51,889
you know you walk into a growing space

431
00:19:48,529 --> 00:19:55,519
and you'll have fans blowing you know a

432
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:58,610
varied amount of air and typically from

433
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:02,180
above down onto the crop or fairly close

434
00:19:58,609 --> 00:20:04,599
to the height of the canopy and I know

435
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:07,549
when I visit a lot of these you'll see

436
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:11,240
leaf leaf burn from the wind where the

437
00:20:07,549 --> 00:20:13,129
plant can't transpire fast enough to

438
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:15,109
make keep up with how quickly the air is

439
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:16,670
moving across that leaf right near the

440
00:20:15,109 --> 00:20:17,869
fan but then it's even further away from

441
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:19,550
the fan like you said you're not getting

442
00:20:17,869 --> 00:20:24,199
that airflow that you need for that

443
00:20:19,549 --> 00:20:26,379
plant so what are some ways that you you

444
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:28,130
fix this I know you mentioned those

445
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:29,600
ducting options

446
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:32,210
I've seen those the fabric ducts that

447
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:34,399
you can run down the aisles but for with

448
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:36,680
a more traditional fan based approach

449
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,880
are there any tips and tricks in terms

450
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:40,759
of where you should be positioning your

451
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:42,890
fans or is there like a I know we have

452
00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:45,799
flow meters for water there once for air

453
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:49,040
that we can use to measure or optimize

454
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:52,460
our fan placement in a room yeah I mean

455
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:54,079
that's a really good question and you

456
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:58,730
know that that's something that we will

457
00:20:54,079 --> 00:21:02,230
do is is air or a fan design so we've

458
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:05,870
actually found that using traditional

459
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:09,079
greenhouse horizontal airflow fans work

460
00:21:05,869 --> 00:21:10,909
pretty well at mixing the air you know I

461
00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:12,829
mean there's kind of two aspects of of

462
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:14,840
air movement one is you know what I've

463
00:21:12,829 --> 00:21:17,329
been talking about about moving air

464
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:19,639
across the plants themselves breaking

465
00:21:17,329 --> 00:21:21,619
out the boundary layer around the leaves

466
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:24,410
you know because basically this pocket

467
00:21:21,619 --> 00:21:26,719
of moisture and heat sort of develop

468
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:30,140
around so we can we want to break that

469
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:32,690
up and facilitate gas exchange but the

470
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:35,960
other thing is just mixing and getting a

471
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:39,950
uniform environment around the entire

472
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:42,140
facility and and so using horizontal

473
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:45,559
airflow fans creating sort of this

474
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:47,820
circular pattern around you know the

475
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:50,429
tops of the crop can

476
00:21:47,819 --> 00:21:52,139
we help to to mix the air because you

477
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:54,269
know you you have the lights and you

478
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:57,000
have fans and you have motors and help

479
00:21:54,269 --> 00:21:59,160
stuff that's sitting above the crop and

480
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,380
then you have the crop down below you

481
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:04,620
know that the totally transpiring and is

482
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:07,500
cooler and more humid and by having

483
00:22:04,619 --> 00:22:09,719
these fans circulating above it actually

484
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:13,680
helps to to break up the boundary layer

485
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:17,250
between the hot and the cold blocks of

486
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:18,930
air that develop vertically right I mean

487
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:22,170
hot every everybody knows that hot air

488
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:25,529
rises and that can be good when you have

489
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:30,240
a lot of heat being generated from from

490
00:22:25,529 --> 00:22:33,180
the lights but also water vapor is less

491
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:38,730
dense than air as is carbon dioxide and

492
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:41,490
so that humidity and not co2 actually

493
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:43,440
you know or I mean so the co2 will kind

494
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:46,500
of you know sink down to the ground and

495
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:49,380
the humidity will actually rise that

496
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:53,099
water vapor will rise up with the heat

497
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:56,910
which is a good thing in general and so

498
00:22:53,099 --> 00:23:00,329
using the HAF fan to to mix things up

499
00:22:56,910 --> 00:23:03,660
and and so that it they actually will

500
00:23:00,329 --> 00:23:07,409
act to sort of help to suck the moisture

501
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:10,259
and the heat up from the top of the

502
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:12,150
canopy while also moving the top of the

503
00:23:10,259 --> 00:23:15,390
canopy and you know a lot of people are

504
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:17,580
really concerned about having you know

505
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:20,580
air movement down below and and that you

506
00:23:17,579 --> 00:23:23,039
know underneath the canopy or at the

507
00:23:20,579 --> 00:23:26,730
lower levels of the canopy and and

508
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:30,000
that's true I mean it is important to to

509
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:31,950
move air to circulate air blower in the

510
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,619
canopy but you know if you're doing a

511
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:39,090
good job of pruning and you don't have a

512
00:23:34,619 --> 00:23:41,849
lot of we smih Tyrael you know sort of

513
00:23:39,089 --> 00:23:44,759
in the lower half of your of your crop

514
00:23:41,849 --> 00:23:47,419
then you really don't need that much air

515
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:51,059
movement down below your plants grow

516
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:54,360
from the top right and the flowers are

517
00:23:51,059 --> 00:23:56,730
at the top and so really air movement at

518
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:59,279
the top of the canopy is the most

519
00:23:56,730 --> 00:24:01,259
critical place to create that gas

520
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,589
exchange to create that air movement

521
00:24:01,259 --> 00:24:02,579
because

522
00:24:01,589 --> 00:24:04,678
that's where all the activities

523
00:24:02,579 --> 00:24:06,000
happening that's all the photosynthesis

524
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:07,798
is happening not Flair

525
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,538
you know the powdery mildew is going to

526
00:24:07,798 --> 00:24:12,240
want to live on the flowers at the top

527
00:24:09,538 --> 00:24:15,900
of the canopy and so having that air

528
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:17,788
movement above the the crop and at the

529
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:25,230
top of the crop is really more critical

530
00:24:17,788 --> 00:24:28,619
than having it from below so yeah our

531
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:30,720
circulation is really important and you

532
00:24:28,619 --> 00:24:32,609
know so so I mentioned horizontal under

533
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:35,940
flow fans but also you know Ducks in

534
00:24:32,609 --> 00:24:38,009
general I mean there's a sort of I mean

535
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:40,830
there's a science but also there's sort

536
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:43,679
of the art in a track engineering of air

537
00:24:40,829 --> 00:24:45,839
distribution design and a lot of people

538
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:48,480
don't realize that the diffusers you

539
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:50,699
know if you look up in your ceiling at

540
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:54,659
home or in the office or whatever and

541
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:59,610
you look at the the diffusers those are

542
00:24:54,659 --> 00:25:01,980
hopefully selected specifically for the

543
00:24:59,609 --> 00:25:04,740
environment that they are trying to

544
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:07,009
control so you know there's a certain

545
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:10,259
throw pattern there's a certain velocity

546
00:25:07,009 --> 00:25:12,028
there's a certain way that air moves out

547
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:14,849
of the different diffusers that are

548
00:25:12,028 --> 00:25:18,298
available to us so that by the time the

549
00:25:14,849 --> 00:25:20,879
air gets down to say your your desk

550
00:25:18,298 --> 00:25:23,038
where you're sitting it's mixed with the

551
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,080
air above and it's the perfect sort of

552
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:27,390
temperature and velocity is to not

553
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:31,558
create a draft or make you uncomfortable

554
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:33,690
in in your workspace well we can do the

555
00:25:31,558 --> 00:25:36,658
same exact thing with plants we can

556
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:38,730
actually be selective with the types of

557
00:25:36,659 --> 00:25:40,649
diffusers and the location of those

558
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:43,558
diffusers relative to each other and

559
00:25:40,648 --> 00:25:46,558
relative to the tops of the plants to

560
00:25:43,558 --> 00:25:48,898
create the environment that we want at

561
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:51,869
the top of the plant you know

562
00:25:48,898 --> 00:25:54,629
unfortunately you know not a lot of

563
00:25:51,869 --> 00:25:58,859
engineers I think take the time or

564
00:25:54,630 --> 00:26:01,140
really understand air distribution

565
00:25:58,859 --> 00:26:04,619
design even for a commercial building

566
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:07,980
I'll be honest and you know a lot of the

567
00:26:04,619 --> 00:26:10,709
contractors to who may be installing

568
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:13,048
those ducts and those diffusers you know

569
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:14,960
are are probably not thinking a lot

570
00:26:13,048 --> 00:26:16,549
about that either but

571
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,559
but there is some science behind that

572
00:26:16,549 --> 00:26:23,119
there can be a method to the madness and

573
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:26,210
how those diffusers are are selected and

574
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:27,979
located that can create a more uniform

575
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:30,380
environment for you the other thing is

576
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:33,500
that I'll be honest I've been pretty

577
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:37,100
impressed with fabric ducts um you know

578
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:39,529
there's a few different manufacturers

579
00:26:37,099 --> 00:26:42,049
that create a good fabric duct and what

580
00:26:39,529 --> 00:26:43,750
I like about them is that if you find

581
00:26:42,049 --> 00:26:47,149
the right company and the right

582
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:49,130
representative of that company they will

583
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:52,490
they will actually ask what is the

584
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:55,850
velocity of the air that you want at the

585
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:58,430
distance you know that your plant is

586
00:26:55,849 --> 00:27:00,549
from where the duct is going to be

587
00:26:58,430 --> 00:27:06,470
installed and they will literally

588
00:27:00,549 --> 00:27:08,029
engineer the holes in those ducts the

589
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:10,069
holes and the nozzles and the

590
00:27:08,029 --> 00:27:14,629
perforation associated with that duck

591
00:27:10,069 --> 00:27:19,669
sock or that fabric duct to to create

592
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:22,640
the velocity of air that you want at the

593
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:25,279
canopy level I've been very impressed

594
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:27,080
with with the companies that I've worked

595
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:31,339
with I mentioned duck sock that's one of

596
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:33,500
them and and and they will work with you

597
00:27:31,339 --> 00:27:37,220
if you say look I want one meter per

598
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:39,859
second at the top of my canopy and my

599
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:43,819
duct is going to be eight feet away from

600
00:27:39,859 --> 00:27:47,949
the top of my canopy can you do that yes

601
00:27:43,819 --> 00:27:51,230
actually they probably can so you know

602
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:54,350
air distribution design does not

603
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:55,519
necessarily have to be a black box and

604
00:27:54,349 --> 00:27:58,189
it doesn't necessarily have to be

605
00:27:55,519 --> 00:28:00,079
haphazard in a way that now we have to

606
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:03,019
throw a whole bunch of fans into the

607
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:06,829
room to blow air around because the

608
00:28:03,019 --> 00:28:09,589
engineer or the contractor or the you

609
00:28:06,829 --> 00:28:11,329
know duck supplier wasn't really asking

610
00:28:09,589 --> 00:28:14,240
the right questions or putting thought

611
00:28:11,329 --> 00:28:16,549
into the design we can design it pretty

612
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:20,599
specifically to create the environment

613
00:28:16,549 --> 00:28:22,460
that we want okay I have a have a bunch

614
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:25,730
of questions from from that last comment

615
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:27,920
but awesome I want to start with these

616
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:28,190
duck socks so what as someone who works

617
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:31,038
with

618
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:33,950
soils indoors in a lot of these

619
00:28:31,038 --> 00:28:39,349
facilities I just picture being a dust

620
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:41,240
and even like my or pathogen magnet in a

621
00:28:39,349 --> 00:28:42,888
lot of ways to where cleaning would be

622
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:46,399
very difficult mmm what are your

623
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:49,869
thoughts on that yeah okay so let's

624
00:28:46,398 --> 00:28:57,138
let's talk about ducks in general and

625
00:28:49,869 --> 00:29:01,939
their propensity potentially for being

626
00:28:57,138 --> 00:29:04,519
in Harbor for for pathogens so I've

627
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:07,610
heard both I've heard some people say

628
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:09,079
that metal ducks can be a harbor for

629
00:29:07,609 --> 00:29:10,849
pathogens and I've heard some people say

630
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:12,528
fabric ducks can be a harbor for

631
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:15,740
pathogens and honestly the answer is

632
00:29:12,528 --> 00:29:20,509
both right so with metal ducks one

633
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:23,960
concern is that you know when they're

634
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:26,628
metal then water can content condense on

635
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:28,370
them and then you can have tripping and

636
00:29:26,628 --> 00:29:31,849
then you have you know sort of a free

637
00:29:28,369 --> 00:29:36,979
surface of water that pathogens love to

638
00:29:31,849 --> 00:29:40,788
live in the two thoughts one if your

639
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:44,990
duck is dripping wet then you are not

640
00:29:40,788 --> 00:29:50,329
controlling humidity the temperature

641
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:53,388
that in your space should be if you're

642
00:29:50,329 --> 00:29:56,418
controlling humidity should be below the

643
00:29:53,388 --> 00:29:59,209
dew point or but I'm sorry should be

644
00:29:56,419 --> 00:30:01,490
above the dew point temperature of the

645
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:04,990
air that's traveling through your duck

646
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:08,109
so dew point is the temperature at which

647
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:12,200
condensation happens right it's when do

648
00:30:08,109 --> 00:30:15,138
is is produced out of the air so

649
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:17,389
basically you know you have moisture in

650
00:30:15,138 --> 00:30:20,869
the air and then you have a cold surface

651
00:30:17,388 --> 00:30:24,019
and that cold surface is at or below dew

652
00:30:20,869 --> 00:30:26,508
point and so that water condenses out of

653
00:30:24,019 --> 00:30:29,839
the air and onto that surface so you see

654
00:30:26,509 --> 00:30:32,778
that you know with a ice you know glass

655
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:35,119
of ice water on a warm humid day in

656
00:30:32,778 --> 00:30:38,359
Texas or anywhere except basically

657
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:40,128
telephone yeah and so that's what's

658
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:41,959
happening is that you know with these

659
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:44,538
would be supplied us you have

660
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:48,259
no cold air coming out of your air

661
00:30:44,538 --> 00:30:50,839
conditioner and then in the facility you

662
00:30:48,259 --> 00:30:55,038
have you know warm moist air that's

663
00:30:50,839 --> 00:30:58,308
being developed so if you're not able to

664
00:30:55,038 --> 00:31:01,398
control dewpoint in your room very well

665
00:30:58,308 --> 00:31:03,379
then yes water can condense on that cold

666
00:31:01,398 --> 00:31:05,959
surface of the duct if you're

667
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:08,899
controlling humidity well then I would

668
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:11,720
argue that would never happen

669
00:31:08,898 --> 00:31:12,619
now to avoid that if you don't want to

670
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:16,250
risk that at all

671
00:31:12,619 --> 00:31:18,439
you can insulate that duct and that

672
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:20,148
would be very common in your office

673
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:22,820
building in a commercial building you

674
00:31:20,148 --> 00:31:24,439
insulate that duct and honestly there's

675
00:31:22,819 --> 00:31:26,538
a couple of good reasons to insulate

676
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:28,940
your duct one is to prevent that risk of

677
00:31:26,538 --> 00:31:30,740
condensation but the other is to make

678
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:33,830
sure that the temperature that's

679
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:35,960
delivered to your room is the same from

680
00:31:33,829 --> 00:31:38,808
beginning to end right I mean if you

681
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:42,409
think about you're blowing say 2,000 CFM

682
00:31:38,808 --> 00:31:46,548
of air down a duct and that air is going

683
00:31:42,409 --> 00:31:49,730
to travel a hundred feet you know if

684
00:31:46,548 --> 00:31:52,970
that duct is inside your room it's being

685
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:55,460
bombarded with with light it's being

686
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:58,850
bombarded with maybe that condensation

687
00:31:55,460 --> 00:32:01,370
could occur or whatever and so by the

688
00:31:58,849 --> 00:32:03,019
time it's traveled that air has traveled

689
00:32:01,369 --> 00:32:05,209
from the air conditioner a hundred feet

690
00:32:03,019 --> 00:32:07,849
to the other end of the room it could be

691
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:09,950
two to five degrees warmer but if you

692
00:32:07,849 --> 00:32:11,658
insulate the duct it's going to be the

693
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:14,419
same temperature from end to end and

694
00:32:11,659 --> 00:32:16,549
you've eliminated that risk of

695
00:32:14,419 --> 00:32:20,240
condensation so that's the metal ducts

696
00:32:16,548 --> 00:32:23,298
in terms of pathogen risk and just

697
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:25,339
condensation in general fabric ducts I

698
00:32:23,298 --> 00:32:29,408
mean it's kind of the same idea right I

699
00:32:25,339 --> 00:32:34,038
mean is is that fabric duct going to

700
00:32:29,409 --> 00:32:39,230
collect water which is inviting to

701
00:32:34,038 --> 00:32:42,769
pathogens well I would you know maybe

702
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:45,288
but the good thing about I mean you know

703
00:32:42,769 --> 00:32:47,450
again it goes back to the air that's

704
00:32:45,288 --> 00:32:49,369
traveling through your duct in the air

705
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:52,340
that's in the room that's been

706
00:32:49,369 --> 00:32:54,829
interacting with the surface of that

707
00:32:52,339 --> 00:32:55,319
duct and so it's sort of the same thing

708
00:32:54,829 --> 00:32:58,559
except

709
00:32:55,319 --> 00:33:03,000
that fabric is not as conductive to heat

710
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:06,389
transfer as metal is so metal is very

711
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:09,960
conductive to heat and so it's going to

712
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:12,360
it's going to maybe have a higher

713
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:16,049
propensity to convince water with fabric

714
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:19,019
it's you know doesn't really conduct

715
00:33:16,049 --> 00:33:21,500
heat that much same like if you took

716
00:33:19,019 --> 00:33:24,180
aluminum versus wood right I mean

717
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:26,339
aluminum gets hot and cold very quickly

718
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:30,110
where would it basically say is the same

719
00:33:26,339 --> 00:33:32,459
temperature until you catch it on fire

720
00:33:30,109 --> 00:33:33,959
so fabric is sort of life you could

721
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:35,670
think of kind of like wood like it's

722
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:38,400
basically going to say to say temp same

723
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:40,470
temperature however I think I do have

724
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:43,230
the concern about fabric ducks in the

725
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:44,970
sense of what I talked about you know

726
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:48,269
the temperature gradient from end to end

727
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:50,220
is that it's a lot harder to insulate

728
00:33:48,269 --> 00:33:51,750
that fabric duct and in fact you don't

729
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:53,549
want to insulate the fabric sucks

730
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:54,809
because it's perforated and if you

731
00:33:53,549 --> 00:33:58,859
insulate it you're going to block all

732
00:33:54,809 --> 00:34:01,500
those holes so so you know for very long

733
00:33:58,859 --> 00:34:03,929
runs of fabric duct you could see a

734
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:05,339
temperature gradient from end to end now

735
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:07,370
what some people really like about

736
00:34:05,339 --> 00:34:10,110
fabric ducts is that they can wash them

737
00:34:07,369 --> 00:34:13,259
so you know you can purchase them in

738
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:15,780
sections and they basically zip up and

739
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:17,670
unzip and you can take out sections and

740
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:21,780
you can throw them in the washing

741
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:24,900
machine with that said do people

742
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:29,720
actually do that I don't know I don't

743
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:32,369
know but at least the option is there

744
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:34,859
and maybe you need an industrial size

745
00:34:32,369 --> 00:34:36,539
washing machine as well to do that so

746
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:38,970
and and think about you know if you

747
00:34:36,539 --> 00:34:41,880
don't have extra pieces on hand and you

748
00:34:38,969 --> 00:34:44,519
may have some downtime unless you can

749
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:46,650
just replace it while you're washing you

750
00:34:44,519 --> 00:34:49,349
know those Ducks or maybe you do want

751
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:52,440
downtime for a week or a few days just

752
00:34:49,349 --> 00:34:57,119
to clean out the room before the next

753
00:34:52,440 --> 00:35:00,809
crop comes in so you know there's

754
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:05,069
there's pros and cons to everything and

755
00:35:00,809 --> 00:35:07,679
I think you know both can be good

756
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:08,670
solutions and don't have to Harbor

757
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:11,068
pathogens

758
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:13,920
don't have to get dirty and get a lot of

759
00:35:11,068 --> 00:35:16,318
condensation if we're able to control

760
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:18,900
the room the way we want to control the

761
00:35:16,318 --> 00:35:22,289
room okay so if we go back to talking

762
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:24,240
about you know airflow in terms of

763
00:35:22,289 --> 00:35:25,920
measurement tools you mentioned that you

764
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:28,289
could say to a ducting company

765
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:31,139
I want one meter per second this

766
00:35:28,289 --> 00:35:34,588
distance away and you know on the canopy

767
00:35:31,139 --> 00:35:38,129
here how did you get that one meter per

768
00:35:34,588 --> 00:35:40,078
second like what's optimal for cannabis

769
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:42,210
in general or do we know I've heard

770
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:43,829
ranges of like three to five miles per

771
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:45,480
hour but to me that doesn't mean

772
00:35:43,829 --> 00:35:48,450
anything like I have no idea what that

773
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:50,548
would look like how is there a tool that

774
00:35:48,449 --> 00:35:52,469
the growers can use that's you know

775
00:35:50,548 --> 00:35:54,630
reasonably affordable to go into a room

776
00:35:52,469 --> 00:35:55,949
and and check different places like like

777
00:35:54,630 --> 00:36:03,960
say we can do with a light meter for

778
00:35:55,949 --> 00:36:08,838
example sure so yes so first off so half

779
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:15,858
a meter to one meter per second is

780
00:36:08,838 --> 00:36:23,279
equivalent to 100 to 200 feet per minute

781
00:36:15,858 --> 00:36:26,308
which is equivalent to one to two miles

782
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,880
per hours so okay so half a meter per

783
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:28,890
second

784
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:31,920
to one meter per second is equivalent to

785
00:36:28,889 --> 00:36:33,750
a hundred to 200 feet per minute which

786
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:37,139
is equivalent to one to two miles per

787
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:39,690
hour and now I mean this is not

788
00:36:37,139 --> 00:36:42,808
necessarily gospel where this number

789
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:45,240
comes from is from vertical farming and

790
00:36:42,809 --> 00:36:48,480
plant factories that what we have found

791
00:36:45,239 --> 00:36:50,969
is at least for for leafy greens for

792
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:53,760
lettuce plants and basil plants that as

793
00:36:50,969 --> 00:36:58,699
long as we're able to grow the plant

794
00:36:53,760 --> 00:37:05,660
within that range of air velocity that

795
00:36:58,699 --> 00:37:10,048
we eliminate we pit burn right and and

796
00:37:05,659 --> 00:37:12,838
get the highest rates of photosynthesis

797
00:37:10,048 --> 00:37:16,259
and productivity and yields so it's a

798
00:37:12,838 --> 00:37:18,960
quality characteristic so so within that

799
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:20,490
range we know that transpiration we have

800
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,440
good transpiration there's a

801
00:37:20,489 --> 00:37:25,949
plant which is why we're not seeing lift

802
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:28,260
it burn and we're getting a good amount

803
00:37:25,949 --> 00:37:32,159
of carbon dioxide to the crop which is

804
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:34,800
allowing for good photosynthesis so it's

805
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:38,789
really based on lettuce crops

806
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:41,730
honestly and you know those those

807
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:43,860
lettuce crops you know are dense right I

808
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:46,500
mean if you think about a head of

809
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:49,230
lettuce those leaves are very close

810
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:52,590
together and so you know we're saying

811
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:56,159
that you know two miles per hour wind

812
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:59,430
speed is good for this Deb's crop

813
00:37:56,159 --> 00:38:01,409
well cannabis honestly I mean unless you

814
00:37:59,429 --> 00:38:03,329
have a dense crop and some people do you

815
00:38:01,409 --> 00:38:04,589
know see you've green they don't prune a

816
00:38:03,329 --> 00:38:07,380
lot they really you know maybe

817
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:11,910
vegetative plants you really want a lot

818
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:13,769
of a lot of leaf area I don't honestly I

819
00:38:11,909 --> 00:38:17,909
don't see why it would be a different

820
00:38:13,769 --> 00:38:20,969
number for for cannabis leaf than it

821
00:38:17,909 --> 00:38:23,429
would be say for a lettuce leaf so I'm

822
00:38:20,969 --> 00:38:25,409
sure a lot of people may argue with me

823
00:38:23,429 --> 00:38:27,690
on that and that's fine the whole idea

824
00:38:25,409 --> 00:38:30,179
is that we want to move air across the

825
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:32,849
plant we don't want stagnant air because

826
00:38:30,179 --> 00:38:37,190
our plants won't transpire and they

827
00:38:32,849 --> 00:38:40,529
won't photosynthesize as effectively so

828
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:43,820
that's where that number comes from and

829
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:47,790
I think because that's the only

830
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:50,760
documented research that it's the place

831
00:38:47,789 --> 00:38:53,849
to start whether you can have an

832
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:56,880
airspeed that's too high I'm not sure

833
00:38:53,849 --> 00:39:00,509
you know it's possible that the air

834
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:05,940
velocity could be too high and the plant

835
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:08,910
starts to close stomata to prevent too

836
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:11,309
much water loss right and so then if

837
00:39:08,909 --> 00:39:13,129
that happens then we're shutting down

838
00:39:11,309 --> 00:39:16,349
transpiration or slowing down

839
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:18,660
transpiration and and then that

840
00:39:16,349 --> 00:39:22,319
effectively reduces nutrient transport

841
00:39:18,659 --> 00:39:27,089
might increase nutrient deficiency you

842
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:29,280
slow down photosynthesis right and same

843
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:32,670
on the other side is that if the air

844
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,839
velocity is too low then that pocket of

845
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:36,900
air that

846
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:39,808
it of moisture will just build up around

847
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:42,838
the stomata and around the leaf so that

848
00:39:39,809 --> 00:39:46,109
it can't effectively exchange water

849
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:49,318
vapor away from the plant and co2 into

850
00:39:46,108 --> 00:39:51,630
the plant so just based on the

851
00:39:49,318 --> 00:39:53,880
documented research you know we know

852
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:57,059
that half a meter per second to one

853
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:57,479
meter per second is a good place to

854
00:39:57,059 --> 00:40:01,079
start

855
00:39:57,478 --> 00:40:03,419
at least with horticultural crops so

856
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:06,930
until somebody does the research on

857
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:11,039
cannabis plants I'm sticking to the

858
00:40:06,929 --> 00:40:14,038
research that I can that I can find on

859
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:16,229
the horticultural yeah now does that

860
00:40:14,039 --> 00:40:18,390
research account for the addition of co2

861
00:40:16,228 --> 00:40:22,558
at fairly high levels into the room

862
00:40:18,389 --> 00:40:26,670
which I assume would affect your air

863
00:40:22,559 --> 00:40:29,609
flow and things like that yes so again

864
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:31,940
you know I mentioned that you know air

865
00:40:29,608 --> 00:40:35,608
movement is responsible for gas exchange

866
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:37,818
period and gas exchange being you know

867
00:40:35,608 --> 00:40:42,119
water vapor away from the plant and co2

868
00:40:37,818 --> 00:40:44,998
to the plant and so you know as long as

869
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:49,048
your environment is enriched and we have

870
00:40:44,998 --> 00:40:51,268
that good mixing from from fans around

871
00:40:49,048 --> 00:40:54,659
the room and all that co2 hasn't sunk to

872
00:40:51,268 --> 00:40:56,899
the floor and can find its way up to to

873
00:40:54,659 --> 00:41:01,528
the leaves and to the top of the canopy

874
00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:05,119
then you know that air movement is going

875
00:41:01,528 --> 00:41:08,579
to help deliver that co2 to the leaves

876
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:11,400
and I don't I don't know that if it's

877
00:41:08,579 --> 00:41:13,710
too high that you know the co2 is going

878
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:15,420
to blow right by the leaf as long as you

879
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:18,960
know we have a good enriched environment

880
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:22,710
but certainly if the air velocity is too

881
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:26,278
low then the co2 might not make it to

882
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:28,858
every plant evenly and how are you

883
00:41:26,278 --> 00:41:31,440
measuring this again what tool are using

884
00:41:28,858 --> 00:41:33,389
for that sure so the tool that we use to

885
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,200
measure air velocity is called an

886
00:41:33,389 --> 00:41:37,170
anemometer

887
00:41:34,199 --> 00:41:40,498
so there's vane anemometers and there's

888
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:45,088
hot wire anemometers vane anemometers

889
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:47,789
tend to measure air speed at a higher

890
00:41:45,088 --> 00:41:50,699
air velocity so 50

891
00:41:47,789 --> 00:41:52,920
well 50 mom from another too high 50

892
00:41:50,699 --> 00:41:55,049
feet per minute and higher usually

893
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:57,960
closer to the hundreds of 200 feet per

894
00:41:55,050 --> 00:42:02,460
minute and higher is where they really

895
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:04,380
is their sweet spot and and the vein

896
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:05,909
anemometers sound like that you know

897
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:08,190
like they have the veins of a fan that

898
00:42:05,909 --> 00:42:10,170
looks like a little fan and you can

899
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:12,599
stick it in front of in front of a fan

900
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:16,680
it'll it'll turn right like a little

901
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:19,949
windmill a hot wire anemometer is what

902
00:42:16,679 --> 00:42:26,609
it sounds like it's a wire and it

903
00:42:19,949 --> 00:42:30,710
basically sends a current based on the

904
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:34,050
wind velocity it will change the current

905
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:38,820
the amperage current to the meter and

906
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:42,150
that gets converted into into a reading

907
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:44,490
of air velocity and so hot wire

908
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:46,110
anemometers they work at high velocities

909
00:42:44,489 --> 00:42:48,659
but they actually work really well at

910
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:51,599
low velocities a lot of times like 10

911
00:42:48,659 --> 00:42:54,119
feet per minute and so you can really

912
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:57,059
fort for these lower air speeds that

913
00:42:54,119 --> 00:43:00,179
we're trying to get across the plants a

914
00:42:57,059 --> 00:43:03,150
hot wire anemometer is really the tool

915
00:43:00,179 --> 00:43:05,909
that growers should use and an engineer

916
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:08,160
should use to sort of spot measure what

917
00:43:05,909 --> 00:43:10,559
the air velocity is at the top of the

918
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:12,690
canopy in the middle on the bottom they

919
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:14,759
use them in the duct things you can

920
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:18,769
stick them in the ducted system as well

921
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:21,930
it's like a long little tube so a lot of

922
00:43:18,769 --> 00:43:27,360
contractors use a hot wire anemometer

923
00:43:21,929 --> 00:43:29,969
even to calibrate the fan speed from

924
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:31,620
from each rack equipment to make sure

925
00:43:29,969 --> 00:43:35,069
that you're getting the right amount of

926
00:43:31,619 --> 00:43:36,539
airflow through the duct thank you for

927
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:38,400
explaining that one other question I had

928
00:43:36,539 --> 00:43:42,449
along this idea of air exchanges when I

929
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:44,519
talked a lot of growers there's the sort

930
00:43:42,449 --> 00:43:46,379
of debate between sealed versus unsealed

931
00:43:44,519 --> 00:43:48,840
brooms with a lot more growers moving

932
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:50,160
towards sealed rooms so I want to talk

933
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:51,600
have you touched a little bit about that

934
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:54,059
but then the other thing I hear about is

935
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:55,440
when people are running unsealed rooms

936
00:43:54,059 --> 00:43:56,670
they talk about air exchange like

937
00:43:55,440 --> 00:44:00,809
they're exchanging the air in the room

938
00:43:56,670 --> 00:44:01,500
this many times per hour how important

939
00:44:00,809 --> 00:44:03,599
is that

940
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:04,949
exchange from you know to look at it

941
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:06,089
from that perspective because everything

942
00:44:04,949 --> 00:44:07,799
that you're talking about right now is

943
00:44:06,090 --> 00:44:09,840
really sort of that movement around the

944
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:11,630
room itself how important is it to get

945
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:15,960
that air out of the room

946
00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:18,210
right so yeah I mean that's a so let's

947
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:22,260
purse us talk about the difference

948
00:44:18,210 --> 00:44:24,960
between air velocity and air volume so

949
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:28,290
air velocity is that that's speed right

950
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:30,150
the wind speed say across your plant so

951
00:44:28,289 --> 00:44:33,599
we just said you know hundreds of 200

952
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:37,079
feet per minute in that range air volume

953
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:40,440
is spoken of in CFM or cubic feet per

954
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:42,659
minute so that's the total volume of air

955
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:45,119
that gets delivered say from your HVAC

956
00:44:42,659 --> 00:44:48,480
system through your dust and into your

957
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:50,759
room it doesn't become air velocity

958
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:53,519
until you know we actually measure the

959
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:55,020
speed of that air so I just want to make

960
00:44:53,519 --> 00:44:56,670
sure that everybody understands that

961
00:44:55,019 --> 00:45:01,079
distinction because sometimes I hear

962
00:44:56,670 --> 00:45:03,450
people use CFM and or CFM

963
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:05,460
interchangeably with velocity the

964
00:45:03,449 --> 00:45:08,089
velocity is beat per minute and volume

965
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:12,269
and CFM so I just wanted to make that

966
00:45:08,090 --> 00:45:15,800
distinction first so high field versus

967
00:45:12,269 --> 00:45:18,659
unseals room yes I understand why people

968
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:21,269
want field rooms there's generally I

969
00:45:18,659 --> 00:45:25,099
would say three reasons to have a

970
00:45:21,269 --> 00:45:28,530
completely recirculating air

971
00:45:25,099 --> 00:45:32,460
conditioning system the ones that I hear

972
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:36,480
are one we want to prevent any

973
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:39,199
contaminant from coming into the

974
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:45,240
facility through the air handling system

975
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:46,829
right the second reason is for odor

976
00:45:45,239 --> 00:45:48,539
control and I know we're going to talk

977
00:45:46,829 --> 00:45:50,909
on odor control a little bit later but

978
00:45:48,539 --> 00:45:53,699
we want to keep Oh ders out and if we

979
00:45:50,909 --> 00:45:55,619
ventilate if we bring air in then that

980
00:45:53,699 --> 00:45:59,759
means we also have to take air out and

981
00:45:55,619 --> 00:46:01,889
that odor you know has or that error has

982
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:04,560
odors which is offensive to our neighbor

983
00:46:01,889 --> 00:46:06,239
listen to you know the building

984
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:10,110
department who's going to give us our

985
00:46:06,239 --> 00:46:12,179
permit and the third reason is carbon

986
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:14,400
dioxide right is that if we're reaching

987
00:46:12,179 --> 00:46:15,359
this environment with co2 we don't want

988
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,849
to just dump it out

989
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:20,309
through the ventilation system you know

990
00:46:17,849 --> 00:46:22,099
we're spending money on that co2 and so

991
00:46:20,309 --> 00:46:26,730
we want to keep it contained

992
00:46:22,099 --> 00:46:29,730
so the unsealed rooms though the rooms

993
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:34,409
that have some ventilation air for me

994
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:37,949
check a few boxes and I actually like to

995
00:46:34,409 --> 00:46:40,769
design facilities that have at least the

996
00:46:37,949 --> 00:46:42,689
option for ventilation air and are not a

997
00:46:40,769 --> 00:46:44,610
hundred percent recirculating and

998
00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:47,970
there's a few reasons for that one is

999
00:46:44,610 --> 00:46:50,550
that building permit is that you know

1000
00:46:47,969 --> 00:46:52,259
the the building code the commercial and

1001
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:53,910
residential building codes and right now

1002
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:55,290
we're sort of in this weird gray area

1003
00:46:53,909 --> 00:46:57,299
where all the building departments are

1004
00:46:55,289 --> 00:46:59,009
trying to figure out how to regulate

1005
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:01,920
these buildings and whether it should

1006
00:46:59,010 --> 00:47:05,610
meet the same standards of higher

1007
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:08,099
standards or lower standards right so so

1008
00:47:05,610 --> 00:47:10,980
the commercial building code has a

1009
00:47:08,099 --> 00:47:13,920
requirement that you have to provide a

1010
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:17,280
certain amount of ventilation air for

1011
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:20,610
people so we know there's all sorts of

1012
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:23,550
studies that show that at elevated

1013
00:47:20,610 --> 00:47:26,849
carbon dioxide levels people are less

1014
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:30,330
productive people think don't think as

1015
00:47:26,849 --> 00:47:34,380
well when co2 levels are just as high as

1016
00:47:30,329 --> 00:47:35,969
600 or 800 parts per million and so you

1017
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:37,829
know the building codes have a

1018
00:47:35,969 --> 00:47:41,369
requirement to provide at least some

1019
00:47:37,829 --> 00:47:44,250
fresh outside air to keep co2 levels

1020
00:47:41,369 --> 00:47:46,799
down at least below a thousand parts per

1021
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:48,329
million so people have a healthy

1022
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:53,550
environment to work in and are more

1023
00:47:48,329 --> 00:47:55,920
productive okay and so by having some

1024
00:47:53,550 --> 00:47:58,830
ventilation air to meet just minimum

1025
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:01,230
building code requirements check that

1026
00:47:58,829 --> 00:48:02,549
box to me that means that a building

1027
00:48:01,230 --> 00:48:04,829
inspector isn't going to come back

1028
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:06,180
through and say hey why aren't you

1029
00:48:04,829 --> 00:48:08,940
meeting our ventilation code

1030
00:48:06,179 --> 00:48:11,699
requirements I'm not giving you a permit

1031
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:14,570
until you change that that would be a

1032
00:48:11,699 --> 00:48:18,000
huge disruption to your construction

1033
00:48:14,570 --> 00:48:22,260
schedule and your operation schedule so

1034
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:23,489
rather than guessing or hoping that

1035
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:25,640
they're not going to have that

1036
00:48:23,489 --> 00:48:29,099
requirement I'd rather just build it in

1037
00:48:25,639 --> 00:48:30,719
because usually it's a very small am now

1038
00:48:29,099 --> 00:48:34,349
of air in California would be equivalent

1039
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:36,419
to 0.15 CFM per square foot you know for

1040
00:48:34,349 --> 00:48:42,380
a 10,000 square foot room

1041
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:47,220
it's like 1500 CFM out of a total of

1042
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:51,119
150,000 CFM think about that it's 2050

1043
00:48:47,219 --> 00:48:54,480
if M versus 150,000 CFM I mean that's

1044
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:57,630
like nothing but it checks the box for

1045
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:59,940
the code official so that's that's the

1046
00:48:57,630 --> 00:49:02,309
first thing the second thing is that

1047
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:07,349
what if your co2 enrichment system goes

1048
00:49:02,309 --> 00:49:10,469
down right how are you going to feed

1049
00:49:07,349 --> 00:49:13,440
your plant if you run out of liquid co2

1050
00:49:10,469 --> 00:49:15,089
or if now you know in the future the

1051
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:18,150
building inspector decides you can't use

1052
00:49:15,090 --> 00:49:22,019
co2 burners in your facility how do you

1053
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:24,720
get co2 into your room I worked with a

1054
00:49:22,019 --> 00:49:28,710
vertical farming client couple years ago

1055
00:49:24,719 --> 00:49:31,230
and they were trying to figure out why

1056
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:32,789
their plants wouldn't grow and so you

1057
00:49:31,230 --> 00:49:34,019
know I'm like I'm on the phone with them

1058
00:49:32,789 --> 00:49:35,369
for a couple hours we're going through

1059
00:49:34,019 --> 00:49:37,590
everything okay what's the temperature

1060
00:49:35,369 --> 00:49:39,630
okay we're looking at the data right the

1061
00:49:37,590 --> 00:49:41,940
circle data the temperatures right on

1062
00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:43,710
target as well as if humidity is right

1063
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:46,019
on target

1064
00:49:43,710 --> 00:49:47,730
they're irrigating the lights are

1065
00:49:46,019 --> 00:49:49,469
working how they thought they should be

1066
00:49:47,730 --> 00:49:51,539
working you know we're going through all

1067
00:49:49,469 --> 00:49:54,029
these different variables and finally I

1068
00:49:51,539 --> 00:49:57,989
just asked this question like you guys

1069
00:49:54,030 --> 00:50:00,240
are enriching with you two right and it

1070
00:49:57,989 --> 00:50:03,750
was just silent on the other side and

1071
00:50:00,239 --> 00:50:06,659
like oh and they had a completely sealed

1072
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:08,639
environment and we're not ventilating or

1073
00:50:06,659 --> 00:50:11,009
enriching the co2 and they went up they

1074
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:13,139
pulled up the data in the co2 level in

1075
00:50:11,010 --> 00:50:16,290
their vertical farm was 200 parts per

1076
00:50:13,139 --> 00:50:20,219
million their plants do you have any

1077
00:50:16,289 --> 00:50:21,420
food yeah so so when people say I want

1078
00:50:20,219 --> 00:50:23,849
to seal the environment because they I

1079
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:25,800
want to keep co2 in I only thought the

1080
00:50:23,849 --> 00:50:29,250
question well what happens when you

1081
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:31,650
don't have any co2 if you have some

1082
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:34,469
ventilation air it doesn't take that

1083
00:50:31,650 --> 00:50:36,420
much to bring co2 in yes we're

1084
00:50:34,469 --> 00:50:38,759
ventilating air because we're trying to

1085
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:41,550
kick co2 out for people but it's also

1086
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:42,450
bringing co2 in that your plants are

1087
00:50:41,550 --> 00:50:45,809
using

1088
00:50:42,449 --> 00:50:48,389
photosynthesis and so again at least

1089
00:50:45,809 --> 00:50:50,280
building it into your system even as an

1090
00:50:48,389 --> 00:50:50,818
option even if you closed the dampers

1091
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:53,160
fine

1092
00:50:50,818 --> 00:50:55,679
let's close them and keep it sealed but

1093
00:50:53,159 --> 00:50:59,940
if you have the option to open them up

1094
00:50:55,679 --> 00:51:02,519
to let ventilation air in you may be

1095
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:06,179
really happy one day that you gave

1096
00:51:02,519 --> 00:51:09,568
yourself that option so and the third

1097
00:51:06,179 --> 00:51:12,389
thing is you know in some climates in

1098
00:51:09,568 --> 00:51:15,659
some climate zones having the

1099
00:51:12,389 --> 00:51:18,440
availability of outside air to condition

1100
00:51:15,659 --> 00:51:21,598
your space could be an energy-saving

1101
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:24,318
measure for you you know if you live in

1102
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:25,588
a location where it can be cool and dry

1103
00:51:24,318 --> 00:51:28,079
Colorado

1104
00:51:25,588 --> 00:51:31,139
perfect example can be cool and dry

1105
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:34,710
during a lot of the year you can

1106
00:51:31,139 --> 00:51:38,900
actually bring that outside air in to

1107
00:51:34,710 --> 00:51:41,068
air condition and dehumidified your face

1108
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:43,079
and now all you're doing is running a

1109
00:51:41,068 --> 00:51:45,480
fan as opposed to a bunch of air

1110
00:51:43,079 --> 00:51:47,670
conditioning compressors and you could

1111
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:51,480
actually reduce you know your energy use

1112
00:51:47,670 --> 00:51:52,740
by you know 80% in any given hour

1113
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:56,159
because the only thing you're running

1114
00:51:52,739 --> 00:51:58,229
are fans and not compressors so you know

1115
00:51:56,159 --> 00:52:00,058
I think but but that doesn't work for

1116
00:51:58,230 --> 00:52:01,889
every climate zone right I mean if

1117
00:52:00,059 --> 00:52:04,109
you're in Hawaii or if you're in Texas

1118
00:52:01,889 --> 00:52:05,909
there's probably not a lot of time where

1119
00:52:04,108 --> 00:52:09,690
that's available to you to use outside

1120
00:52:05,909 --> 00:52:12,798
air and so that wouldn't make sense but

1121
00:52:09,690 --> 00:52:17,068
yeah using aren't least having the

1122
00:52:12,798 --> 00:52:20,039
option for outside air I think is is a

1123
00:52:17,068 --> 00:52:23,308
really good idea and in terms of

1124
00:52:20,039 --> 00:52:25,889
contamination and bringing in you know

1125
00:52:23,309 --> 00:52:29,069
pathogens and pests into the building I

1126
00:52:25,889 --> 00:52:31,949
get it but you know there's there's not

1127
00:52:29,068 --> 00:52:34,079
as much in the air as people think there

1128
00:52:31,949 --> 00:52:35,969
is you know I'm of the school of thought

1129
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:39,150
that people transfer pests and pathogens

1130
00:52:35,969 --> 00:52:41,669
not the air right people who have those

1131
00:52:39,150 --> 00:52:44,519
home grows that sticks plant one light

1132
00:52:41,670 --> 00:52:47,159
can't grow at home and then come into

1133
00:52:44,519 --> 00:52:49,980
the 5,000 square foot grow facility and

1134
00:52:47,159 --> 00:52:51,868
don't put on gloves don't change out of

1135
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:53,969
their street clothes and just start

1136
00:52:51,869 --> 00:52:55,230
touching plan that's where powdery

1137
00:52:53,969 --> 00:52:57,689
mildew comes from

1138
00:52:55,230 --> 00:52:59,940
it's not coming from you know your air

1139
00:52:57,690 --> 00:53:03,358
conditioning system that has that has

1140
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:06,780
filters on it and while I'm talking

1141
00:53:03,358 --> 00:53:09,480
about filters I'm on the topic I do want

1142
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:13,200
to say that all you really need in terms

1143
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:19,260
of filters to keep mold spores out of

1144
00:53:13,199 --> 00:53:23,489
your facility is a merv 13 filter you do

1145
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:25,710
not need hepa filtration to keep mold

1146
00:53:23,489 --> 00:53:27,839
spores out of your facility's hepa

1147
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:31,500
filters are great if you're concerned

1148
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:35,070
about viruses but if you're concerned

1149
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:37,380
about botrytis and powdery mildew then

1150
00:53:35,070 --> 00:53:39,510
all you need is a mer 13 filter but I

1151
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:48,930
will say that you should also install a

1152
00:53:39,510 --> 00:53:53,040
merv 8 filter before your Mar 13 2014 4

1153
00:53:48,929 --> 00:53:57,179
particles so I want to make that plug on

1154
00:53:53,039 --> 00:54:00,570
filters because HEPA czar just overkill

1155
00:53:57,179 --> 00:54:02,039
oh that's great I I do wonder that what

1156
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:04,880
about pesticide drift because that's

1157
00:54:02,039 --> 00:54:07,259
another reason to avoid air exchange

1158
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:09,809
potentially as well if you were in you

1159
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:11,190
know agricultural area and you're

1160
00:54:09,809 --> 00:54:14,659
worried about what the farmer next door

1161
00:54:11,190 --> 00:54:18,030
is spring absolutely pesticide risk

1162
00:54:14,659 --> 00:54:20,699
honestly it's so interesting to me in

1163
00:54:18,030 --> 00:54:24,630
this industry I've never heard concerns

1164
00:54:20,699 --> 00:54:28,108
about pesticide drift in you know in

1165
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:30,690
mushroom production or in commercial

1166
00:54:28,108 --> 00:54:33,690
tomato production or pepper production

1167
00:54:30,690 --> 00:54:35,490
or lettuce production pesticide drift is

1168
00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:39,300
not something that people are thinking

1169
00:54:35,489 --> 00:54:41,549
about and you know I'm guessing the

1170
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:44,580
reason pesticide drift is so important

1171
00:54:41,550 --> 00:54:46,080
for cannabis growers is because if you

1172
00:54:44,579 --> 00:54:49,440
get a lab test that says that you have

1173
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:51,000
pesticide residue on it you're out right

1174
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:53,490
but if you're a tomato grower I mean

1175
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:55,769
that's that's not an issue for you and

1176
00:54:53,489 --> 00:54:59,689
so I find that pesticide drift challenge

1177
00:54:55,769 --> 00:55:02,009
really interesting and and yeah I mean

1178
00:54:59,690 --> 00:55:04,550
you know especially with greenhouses

1179
00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:07,530
what you're trying to use conventional

1180
00:55:04,550 --> 00:55:08,940
you know ventilation or pad and fan

1181
00:55:07,530 --> 00:55:12,480
systems

1182
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:16,710
and you are close to a farm or in an

1183
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:21,269
agricultural area where your neighbors

1184
00:55:16,710 --> 00:55:24,300
might be using pesticides or other sort

1185
00:55:21,269 --> 00:55:27,349
of chemical fertilizers either then I

1186
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:29,430
would say that is definitely a concern

1187
00:55:27,349 --> 00:55:31,200
now there's a couple things about that

1188
00:55:29,429 --> 00:55:34,078
one is you could get to know your

1189
00:55:31,199 --> 00:55:36,379
neighbors and make friends with them and

1190
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:39,450
find out when they're going to spray

1191
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:41,250
right and you know there's there are

1192
00:55:39,449 --> 00:55:43,500
rules and regulations about when you're

1193
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:45,800
allowed to spray you know you're not

1194
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:48,300
allowed to spray during inversion layers

1195
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:52,039
because it just keeps it all down right

1196
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:55,079
and it can't you know get out of the air

1197
00:55:52,039 --> 00:55:57,960
you know what am I trying to say

1198
00:55:55,079 --> 00:56:04,289
down near you know the human-occupied

1199
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:07,380
zone and you also I'm pretty sure most

1200
00:56:04,289 --> 00:56:10,559
farmers don't want to spray on windy

1201
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:12,720
days because they're going to lose a lot

1202
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:14,519
of the chemicals to their neighbors or

1203
00:56:12,719 --> 00:56:17,879
it's not going to get on their crop like

1204
00:56:14,519 --> 00:56:19,829
they want it to right so so you're

1205
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:22,640
getting to know your neighbors who might

1206
00:56:19,829 --> 00:56:25,769
be field farmers and might be spraying

1207
00:56:22,639 --> 00:56:28,409
fertilizers and pesticides on their crop

1208
00:56:25,769 --> 00:56:30,599
is if you know if you have a good

1209
00:56:28,409 --> 00:56:34,230
relationship with them and you know when

1210
00:56:30,599 --> 00:56:36,450
they're going to spray you could take

1211
00:56:34,230 --> 00:56:37,260
that into account in terms of your your

1212
00:56:36,449 --> 00:56:40,078
operation

1213
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:42,619
right is that if if they're not spraying

1214
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:46,050
today and it's a beautiful cool dry day

1215
00:56:42,619 --> 00:56:49,108
then open up your air conditioner right

1216
00:56:46,050 --> 00:56:51,810
let let outside air come in all you want

1217
00:56:49,108 --> 00:56:54,630
all you can to reduce energy and

1218
00:56:51,809 --> 00:56:56,818
supplement with co2 and save on that and

1219
00:56:54,630 --> 00:56:58,800
then you know tomorrow and then you have

1220
00:56:56,818 --> 00:56:59,789
a phone call with your your neighbor and

1221
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:01,410
he's like hey I'm going to spray

1222
00:56:59,789 --> 00:57:04,588
tomorrow like the perfect conditions to

1223
00:57:01,409 --> 00:57:06,629
do that and you say hey you know thanks

1224
00:57:04,588 --> 00:57:08,940
Joe I'm you know thanks for letting me

1225
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:10,079
know and then that day you can close it

1226
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:13,650
up and do a hundred percent

1227
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:16,740
recirculating system so you know I

1228
00:57:13,650 --> 00:57:19,579
totally get the concern but I think

1229
00:57:16,739 --> 00:57:22,589
there are sort of ways to work within

1230
00:57:19,579 --> 00:57:25,950
you know the agricultural regularly

1231
00:57:22,590 --> 00:57:27,630
as well as you know just having a good

1232
00:57:25,949 --> 00:57:29,609
relationship with with the neighbors

1233
00:57:27,630 --> 00:57:32,160
around you that might be doing spray

1234
00:57:29,610 --> 00:57:33,930
application yeah you know I'm hopeful

1235
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:37,409
though that this industry the cannabis

1236
00:57:33,929 --> 00:57:39,809
industry can potentially be a catalyst

1237
00:57:37,409 --> 00:57:41,549
for some change within our greater

1238
00:57:39,809 --> 00:57:42,900
agricultural industry and looking at

1239
00:57:41,550 --> 00:57:45,780
some of these rules and regulations

1240
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:47,450
totally it's it's an issue like just two

1241
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:50,400
weeks ago this is a little bit of a

1242
00:57:47,449 --> 00:57:52,349
tangent but I had a lady contact me

1243
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:54,329
about heavy metal levels in compost and

1244
00:57:52,349 --> 00:57:56,279
so I called the Washington State

1245
00:57:54,329 --> 00:57:57,869
Department of Ag and basically I was

1246
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:59,610
told that as long as you're a soil

1247
00:57:57,869 --> 00:58:01,980
amendment they're not testing for heavy

1248
00:57:59,610 --> 00:58:03,990
metals you know and compost is just sold

1249
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:05,309
as you know primarily for gardens so

1250
00:58:03,989 --> 00:58:07,109
primarily for vegetables so that I

1251
00:58:05,309 --> 00:58:10,170
called the Oregon Department of Ag and

1252
00:58:07,110 --> 00:58:11,550
they told me that if you're putting into

1253
00:58:10,170 --> 00:58:13,440
a bag then they do have some

1254
00:58:11,550 --> 00:58:17,490
requirements and testing around that but

1255
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:19,200
they had set the level at 247 ppm it was

1256
00:58:17,489 --> 00:58:20,849
somewhere right around there for lead

1257
00:58:19,199 --> 00:58:23,309
that lead was the one we were concerned

1258
00:58:20,849 --> 00:58:26,190
about with this particular this

1259
00:58:23,309 --> 00:58:28,500
particular product and basically what I

1260
00:58:26,190 --> 00:58:31,760
was told is that that level was set by

1261
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:37,079
someone that was contracted by the I

1262
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:38,610
guess it was the FDA originally as like

1263
00:58:37,079 --> 00:58:40,469
an outside consulting group and it's

1264
00:58:38,610 --> 00:58:42,390
like can you send me the research as to

1265
00:58:40,469 --> 00:58:44,099
why they came up with this very specific

1266
00:58:42,389 --> 00:58:45,389
number that was allowed in crops because

1267
00:58:44,099 --> 00:58:47,429
I would assume if you're growing

1268
00:58:45,389 --> 00:58:50,219
cannabis or a root crop it would have

1269
00:58:47,429 --> 00:58:52,230
higher levels of heavy-metal uptake and

1270
00:58:50,219 --> 00:58:54,539
I haven't gotten that research yet but

1271
00:58:52,230 --> 00:58:56,820
it just it made me realize that

1272
00:58:54,539 --> 00:58:58,860
sometimes I am a little too trusting

1273
00:58:56,820 --> 00:59:00,030
about about things and assume that I've

1274
00:58:58,860 --> 00:59:02,550
you know the government's looking out

1275
00:59:00,030 --> 00:59:04,530
for me on this stuff but in reality that

1276
00:59:02,550 --> 00:59:06,960
may not be the case and and I think

1277
00:59:04,530 --> 00:59:10,560
pesticide drift kind of falls into that

1278
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:12,630
category but I would totally agree with

1279
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:16,549
you and that I think that the cannabis

1280
00:59:12,630 --> 00:59:19,559
industry is a catalyst for change and

1281
00:59:16,550 --> 00:59:24,120
for technology development and

1282
00:59:19,559 --> 00:59:27,840
regulation development in general and I

1283
00:59:24,119 --> 00:59:34,039
think we'll all be for the public good

1284
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:35,640
and and for you know the building up and

1285
00:59:34,039 --> 00:59:38,849
evolution

1286
00:59:35,639 --> 00:59:41,400
of of agriculture in general you know

1287
00:59:38,849 --> 00:59:45,089
because agriculture is moving indoors or

1288
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:48,389
some of it is and will you know even if

1289
00:59:45,090 --> 00:59:50,250
we're not growing wheat indoors fine but

1290
00:59:48,389 --> 00:59:54,239
if we're growing you know vitamin-rich

1291
00:59:50,250 --> 00:59:55,739
crops indoors then you know the things

1292
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:58,919
that we're learning from track and trace

1293
00:59:55,739 --> 01:00:01,769
and from you know from organic

1294
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:04,139
certification and from pesticide use I

1295
01:00:01,769 --> 01:00:05,400
think a lot of that you know it's going

1296
01:00:04,139 --> 01:00:09,239
to transfer over

1297
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:11,160
you know from cannabis to to indoor

1298
01:00:09,239 --> 01:00:12,839
agriculture in general as well as

1299
01:00:11,159 --> 01:00:15,929
technology I mean you know there's so

1300
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:19,400
much of us in the in the industry who

1301
01:00:15,929 --> 01:00:24,929
are so grateful for cannabis because

1302
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:27,869
we're getting rapid R&amp;D on things like

1303
01:00:24,929 --> 01:00:30,929
lighting and irrigation systems in

1304
01:00:27,869 --> 01:00:35,219
e-track systems and you know these

1305
01:00:30,929 --> 01:00:38,779
equipment and systems that can be more

1306
01:00:35,219 --> 01:00:42,239
focused on growing plants indoors

1307
01:00:38,780 --> 01:00:44,940
aka horticulture and what's good for

1308
01:00:42,239 --> 01:00:47,729
cannabis is good for the rest of the

1309
01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:50,250
industry it's even a training ground

1310
01:00:47,730 --> 01:00:54,119
right I mean for for future farmers is

1311
01:00:50,250 --> 01:00:56,099
that you know a lot of young people you

1312
01:00:54,119 --> 01:00:57,960
know are growing cannabis and you know

1313
01:00:56,099 --> 01:01:01,079
talked to so many of them who have

1314
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:02,639
either moved into more traditional

1315
01:01:01,079 --> 01:01:06,179
horticulture and are growing tomatoes

1316
01:01:02,639 --> 01:01:07,619
and lettuce or who want to eventually so

1317
01:01:06,179 --> 01:01:12,210
it's it's very exciting

1318
01:01:07,619 --> 01:01:14,130
you know those of us in in indoor

1319
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:17,789
agriculture controlled environment

1320
01:01:14,130 --> 01:01:19,829
agriculture in general see a lot of

1321
01:01:17,789 --> 01:01:22,710
crossover and see a lot of benefits

1322
01:01:19,829 --> 01:01:25,289
coming from cannabis for for agriculture

1323
01:01:22,710 --> 01:01:26,610
and horticulture at large yeah I totally

1324
01:01:25,289 --> 01:01:31,409
agree with that I loved it it's a

1325
01:01:26,610 --> 01:01:35,579
gateway drug now for itself I enjoy a

1326
01:01:31,409 --> 01:01:37,019
drug for farming I love it yeah so one

1327
01:01:35,579 --> 01:01:39,059
question I had when you were getting

1328
01:01:37,019 --> 01:01:41,820
back to the sealed versus unsealed room

1329
01:01:39,059 --> 01:01:42,900
concept here when you were talking about

1330
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:44,820
that we're kind of talking about one

1331
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:46,800
entity just like one room but what I in

1332
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:48,780
my head I'm picturing is let's say a ten

1333
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:49,349
thousand square foot building that then

1334
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:51,269
has

1335
01:01:49,349 --> 01:01:54,479
you know maybe six one thousand square

1336
01:01:51,268 --> 01:01:56,218
foot sealed rooms inside of that

1337
01:01:54,478 --> 01:01:58,169
building so we have air exchange outside

1338
01:01:56,219 --> 01:02:00,150
but like I was just in a facility you

1339
01:01:58,170 --> 01:02:01,949
know a metal a metal warehouse in

1340
01:02:00,150 --> 01:02:03,599
Oklahoma for example where you have

1341
01:02:01,949 --> 01:02:06,269
temperature extremes you may have a

1342
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:08,489
hundred and two degree temperatures

1343
01:02:06,268 --> 01:02:10,139
outside at some point and you might be

1344
01:02:08,489 --> 01:02:12,599
below freezing and other points during

1345
01:02:10,139 --> 01:02:14,248
the season and you know just while I was

1346
01:02:12,599 --> 01:02:17,430
there there was I think a 20 degree

1347
01:02:14,248 --> 01:02:19,738
temperature swing to where I would I

1348
01:02:17,429 --> 01:02:21,328
would think we'd want to have at least

1349
01:02:19,739 --> 01:02:23,039
where we're growing the plants more of a

1350
01:02:21,329 --> 01:02:24,989
sealed room and it may be air exchange

1351
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:26,670
into a larger area where the temperature

1352
01:02:24,989 --> 01:02:28,079
isn't quite as controlled where say you

1353
01:02:26,670 --> 01:02:30,449
know a lot of the processing and

1354
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:32,219
packaging and admin stuff is going on I

1355
01:02:30,449 --> 01:02:35,789
mean what are your thoughts around that

1356
01:02:32,219 --> 01:02:38,130
sort of a set up yeah I mean you know so

1357
01:02:35,789 --> 01:02:40,589
many facilities are being built is sort

1358
01:02:38,130 --> 01:02:43,170
of rooms within a room right where or

1359
01:02:40,588 --> 01:02:45,989
rooms within a building where you have

1360
01:02:43,170 --> 01:02:49,499
insulated panel walls of some sort that

1361
01:02:45,989 --> 01:02:52,170
are built into a warehouse which you

1362
01:02:49,498 --> 01:02:53,848
know the the where health exterior walls

1363
01:02:52,170 --> 01:02:56,849
in roof are having the direct

1364
01:02:53,849 --> 01:02:59,880
interaction with the outside and then

1365
01:02:56,849 --> 01:03:02,548
you have you know these insulated rooms

1366
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:04,619
that are interacting more with the

1367
01:03:02,548 --> 01:03:05,998
inside of the warehouse which may or may

1368
01:03:04,619 --> 01:03:08,309
not be controlled but it's probably

1369
01:03:05,998 --> 01:03:13,308
tempered at least from what's happening

1370
01:03:08,309 --> 01:03:17,160
outside and you know those sealed rooms

1371
01:03:13,309 --> 01:03:19,199
are great in terms of heat transfer rate

1372
01:03:17,159 --> 01:03:21,920
and moisture transfer we know that we're

1373
01:03:19,199 --> 01:03:25,349
not going to have a lot of heat weaving

1374
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:27,449
the walls in the roof or even water

1375
01:03:25,349 --> 01:03:30,410
vapor transferring through which can

1376
01:03:27,449 --> 01:03:33,298
make humidity control really challenging

1377
01:03:30,409 --> 01:03:37,018
because of those insulated panel walls

1378
01:03:33,298 --> 01:03:39,538
and that's a good thing because the more

1379
01:03:37,018 --> 01:03:43,528
that we can control the gains and losses

1380
01:03:39,539 --> 01:03:46,199
across the envelope the more predictable

1381
01:03:43,528 --> 01:03:47,728
it's going to be what the loads are at

1382
01:03:46,199 --> 01:03:50,400
any given time from the plants and

1383
01:03:47,728 --> 01:03:53,909
whites and the fans and everything now

1384
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:56,699
in terms of you know yeah the warehouse

1385
01:03:53,909 --> 01:03:59,518
building itself you know can be

1386
01:03:56,699 --> 01:04:03,000
insulated you don't necessarily have to

1387
01:03:59,518 --> 01:04:08,279
have these insulated walls these

1388
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:13,500
rooms built into a warehouse using those

1389
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:15,960
that panel system we can do more sort of

1390
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:19,199
traditional construction and we can

1391
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:21,780
build out you know partitioning walls

1392
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:25,289
within the warehouse and have them

1393
01:04:21,780 --> 01:04:27,840
insulated I would recommend using rigid

1394
01:04:25,289 --> 01:04:29,480
insulation and metal stud walls as

1395
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:32,850
opposed to wood and batt insulation

1396
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:35,719
which will have a greater propensity to

1397
01:04:32,849 --> 01:04:38,909
grow mold and get wet

1398
01:04:35,719 --> 01:04:40,709
but then in terms of interaction with

1399
01:04:38,909 --> 01:04:43,319
the rest of the facility so if you say

1400
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:45,329
have six grow rooms and then you have a

1401
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:48,300
common corridor and then you have all

1402
01:04:45,329 --> 01:04:51,929
the you know post-harvest packaging and

1403
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:54,750
drying in office areas you know the way

1404
01:04:51,929 --> 01:04:57,509
that I like to design the facility like

1405
01:04:54,750 --> 01:05:00,750
that is to make those grow room slightly

1406
01:04:57,510 --> 01:05:05,340
positively pressurized and this is this

1407
01:05:00,750 --> 01:05:08,039
becomes a for good reason for bringing

1408
01:05:05,340 --> 01:05:12,030
in outside air is that we can positively

1409
01:05:08,039 --> 01:05:16,860
pressurize these rooms so that we can

1410
01:05:12,030 --> 01:05:20,070
keep contaminants out so if you know if

1411
01:05:16,860 --> 01:05:22,829
you imagine just say four rooms you know

1412
01:05:20,070 --> 01:05:25,590
two across from each other split by a

1413
01:05:22,829 --> 01:05:30,090
common corridor and if those two grow

1414
01:05:25,590 --> 01:05:32,490
rooms have slightly more air that's

1415
01:05:30,090 --> 01:05:35,880
blown into them then what didn't say

1416
01:05:32,489 --> 01:05:38,489
that common corridor then that air is

1417
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:40,680
going to want to push out of those rooms

1418
01:05:38,489 --> 01:05:43,139
and say under the cracks of the doors

1419
01:05:40,679 --> 01:05:44,849
right the door jams and every time you

1420
01:05:43,139 --> 01:05:48,179
open the door to go into the facility

1421
01:05:44,849 --> 01:05:50,210
air will push out of it and by creating

1422
01:05:48,179 --> 01:05:53,549
that positive pressure continue no

1423
01:05:50,210 --> 01:05:54,659
pathogens and bugs you know they they

1424
01:05:53,550 --> 01:05:57,000
like to follow the path of least

1425
01:05:54,659 --> 01:06:00,389
resistance right they kind of go with

1426
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:03,329
the flow and so if you open a door and

1427
01:06:00,389 --> 01:06:05,279
air is pushing back on them you know

1428
01:06:03,329 --> 01:06:07,409
they're not going to push against that

1429
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:10,320
they're not going to you know go into

1430
01:06:07,409 --> 01:06:13,949
that room unless they're stuck on you

1431
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:15,600
say and so you know positively

1432
01:06:13,949 --> 01:06:16,919
pressurizing that room and then having a

1433
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:18,659
corridor that's maybe

1434
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:21,030
slightly negatively pressurized so you

1435
01:06:18,659 --> 01:06:23,699
have a little bit more suckage

1436
01:06:21,030 --> 01:06:26,820
in the corridor so that then is pulling

1437
01:06:23,699 --> 01:06:29,250
that air out of the building and then

1438
01:06:26,820 --> 01:06:32,580
you can run that air through a carbon

1439
01:06:29,250 --> 01:06:34,440
filter before you know at least it

1440
01:06:32,579 --> 01:06:37,829
leaves the building or as its leaving

1441
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:40,889
the building so that you prevent the

1442
01:06:37,829 --> 01:06:44,039
odors from leaving so yeah I don't know

1443
01:06:40,889 --> 01:06:45,269
if that answers your question yeah

1444
01:06:44,039 --> 01:06:47,250
that's sort of what I was thinking is

1445
01:06:45,269 --> 01:06:49,199
positive pressure in the rooms negative

1446
01:06:47,250 --> 01:06:50,789
pressure in the larger building and then

1447
01:06:49,199 --> 01:06:52,019
you're not trying to odor control each

1448
01:06:50,789 --> 01:06:53,550
room because you don't care if the

1449
01:06:52,019 --> 01:06:55,920
facility smells you just don't want to

1450
01:06:53,550 --> 01:06:58,560
you know tick off your neighbors or get

1451
01:06:55,920 --> 01:07:03,000
a complaint outside the facility but I

1452
01:06:58,559 --> 01:07:04,799
like smaller rooms because you can't you

1453
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:06,769
can't adjust them you know each room is

1454
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:10,410
slightly adjustable it allows you to

1455
01:07:06,769 --> 01:07:11,820
separate the plants and sort of keep you

1456
01:07:10,409 --> 01:07:13,409
know different issues in different rooms

1457
01:07:11,820 --> 01:07:14,970
so if you have thrips in room one you

1458
01:07:13,409 --> 01:07:16,829
don't necessarily have to have thrips in

1459
01:07:14,969 --> 01:07:19,169
your entire crop room two could still be

1460
01:07:16,829 --> 01:07:21,509
clean or room three and in addition that

1461
01:07:19,170 --> 01:07:24,840
you know along those lines yeah you know

1462
01:07:21,510 --> 01:07:26,280
I feel like smaller rooms too I mean

1463
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:28,200
they don't have to be super small maybe

1464
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:31,260
five hundred square feet you know is

1465
01:07:28,199 --> 01:07:35,669
kind of the lower end of the size of a

1466
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:37,290
room that that I might like to see but I

1467
01:07:35,670 --> 01:07:39,389
think ten thousand square feet is too

1468
01:07:37,289 --> 01:07:41,639
big I think five thousand square feet is

1469
01:07:39,389 --> 01:07:43,230
probably too big I think somewhere

1470
01:07:41,639 --> 01:07:46,409
between a thousand and two thousand

1471
01:07:43,230 --> 01:07:49,639
square feet feels to me like the right

1472
01:07:46,409 --> 01:07:52,379
size and you know you mentioned

1473
01:07:49,639 --> 01:07:56,699
containment for pathogens right is that

1474
01:07:52,380 --> 01:07:59,220
if you get a room that gets infected or

1475
01:07:56,699 --> 01:08:01,949
contaminated with thrips or powdery

1476
01:07:59,219 --> 01:08:06,269
mildew then its contained to a small

1477
01:08:01,949 --> 01:08:08,429
room and you know or to a small yield

1478
01:08:06,269 --> 01:08:10,530
and crop and so then you can just take

1479
01:08:08,429 --> 01:08:13,109
that crop and run it through extraction

1480
01:08:10,530 --> 01:08:16,980
and call it a day right and maybe you

1481
01:08:13,110 --> 01:08:19,800
don't completely lose everything and and

1482
01:08:16,979 --> 01:08:22,289
the other thing too is that I think

1483
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:25,320
something that's totally overlooked or

1484
01:08:22,289 --> 01:08:28,609
too often overlooked is when you have a

1485
01:08:25,319 --> 01:08:31,908
really big room that usually means

1486
01:08:28,609 --> 01:08:35,029
you have a lot of different cultivars or

1487
01:08:31,908 --> 01:08:37,039
strains in that room right I mean if you

1488
01:08:35,029 --> 01:08:39,830
think about you have a thousand square

1489
01:08:37,039 --> 01:08:41,929
foot room and maybe it has two different

1490
01:08:39,829 --> 01:08:43,670
cultivars in that room well now if you

1491
01:08:41,929 --> 01:08:47,029
have a ten thousand square foot room

1492
01:08:43,670 --> 01:08:50,509
does that mean you have twenty different

1493
01:08:47,029 --> 01:08:54,529
strains in that room and how do you

1494
01:08:50,509 --> 01:08:57,500
control the temperature in the humidity

1495
01:08:54,529 --> 01:09:00,589
and the lighting level and the

1496
01:08:57,500 --> 01:09:03,948
irrigation even in the nutrient mix for

1497
01:09:00,588 --> 01:09:05,960
all those different strains which you

1498
01:09:03,948 --> 01:09:08,329
know you have indica and you have sativa

1499
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:10,880
you have hybrids and you have you have

1500
01:09:08,329 --> 01:09:12,859
an indica that that grows like a sativa

1501
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:15,170
or you have a sativa that grows like an

1502
01:09:12,859 --> 01:09:17,389
indica right like how are you supposed

1503
01:09:15,170 --> 01:09:20,750
to control all those variables for the

1504
01:09:17,389 --> 01:09:23,210
very specific breed of plants that you

1505
01:09:20,750 --> 01:09:25,310
have when you have a lot of them you

1506
01:09:23,210 --> 01:09:29,109
know if you have a smaller room and

1507
01:09:25,310 --> 01:09:35,750
maybe you could maybe you can actually

1508
01:09:29,109 --> 01:09:41,088
schedule the the cultivation of two

1509
01:09:35,750 --> 01:09:44,929
strains that physiologically liked the

1510
01:09:41,088 --> 01:09:46,250
same environment right like the same

1511
01:09:44,929 --> 01:09:48,338
levels of light like the same

1512
01:09:46,250 --> 01:09:52,310
temperature and humidity like the same

1513
01:09:48,338 --> 01:09:56,600
nutrient mix and now you can really dial

1514
01:09:52,310 --> 01:09:59,869
in the conditions specifically for that

1515
01:09:56,600 --> 01:10:01,610
one or two or maybe three strains how

1516
01:09:59,868 --> 01:10:04,639
beautiful would that be if we can

1517
01:10:01,609 --> 01:10:09,259
actually optimize the environment for

1518
01:10:04,639 --> 01:10:11,960
the plant right as opposed to what most

1519
01:10:09,260 --> 01:10:13,909
growers do is it like okay we have six

1520
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:16,158
strains in here and we do that because

1521
01:10:13,908 --> 01:10:18,529
the market like c6 strains or because

1522
01:10:16,158 --> 01:10:22,819
we're testing a new strain or whatever

1523
01:10:18,529 --> 01:10:24,198
and they're constantly hitting the

1524
01:10:22,819 --> 01:10:27,408
accelerator and pushing the brake at the

1525
01:10:24,198 --> 01:10:29,658
same time right I mean you can't by

1526
01:10:27,408 --> 01:10:33,799
trying to make everybody happy you make

1527
01:10:29,658 --> 01:10:37,189
nobody happy right I mean that is so

1528
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:39,590
true for these plants is that you you

1529
01:10:37,189 --> 01:10:41,988
end up picking a temperature and

1530
01:10:39,590 --> 01:10:45,350
humidity and a lighting level

1531
01:10:41,988 --> 01:10:48,529
that isn't really optimized for any of

1532
01:10:45,350 --> 01:10:53,660
those strains it's just optimal for

1533
01:10:48,529 --> 01:10:59,359
keeping them happy but not you know

1534
01:10:53,659 --> 01:11:02,149
joyful if I could use that analogy and

1535
01:10:59,359 --> 01:11:06,199
so you know I think you know having

1536
01:11:02,149 --> 01:11:08,988
smaller rooms and in focusing your

1537
01:11:06,199 --> 01:11:12,170
environment on just one or two really

1538
01:11:08,988 --> 01:11:15,619
similar physiological strains I think

1539
01:11:12,170 --> 01:11:18,409
growers would be really surprised by how

1540
01:11:15,619 --> 01:11:21,738
well their plants would do how well they

1541
01:11:18,409 --> 01:11:25,279
would respond to the perfect level of

1542
01:11:21,738 --> 01:11:28,968
ppfd you know and the perfect vapor

1543
01:11:25,279 --> 01:11:33,189
pressure deficit that they were bred

1544
01:11:28,969 --> 01:11:36,439
quite honestly to thrive in right I mean

1545
01:11:33,189 --> 01:11:39,500
in our you didn't call on me for for a

1546
01:11:36,439 --> 01:11:41,119
discussion on breeding but if you think

1547
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:44,119
about where so many of these crops have

1548
01:11:41,119 --> 01:11:47,750
come from you know I mean they were bred

1549
01:11:44,119 --> 01:11:50,000
for very specific environments for their

1550
01:11:47,750 --> 01:11:51,590
specific grower and there are specific

1551
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:53,659
conditions and there are specific

1552
01:11:51,590 --> 01:11:56,060
equipment and there are specific climate

1553
01:11:53,659 --> 01:12:00,949
outside and then we try to shove them

1554
01:11:56,060 --> 01:12:04,090
into our box and they don't respond the

1555
01:12:00,949 --> 01:12:07,429
same because we don't have the same

1556
01:12:04,090 --> 01:12:10,880
parameters or the same control or this

1557
01:12:07,430 --> 01:12:15,079
or an understanding of what those plants

1558
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:17,630
were specifically bred to thrive in so

1559
01:12:15,079 --> 01:12:19,399
you know I think there's a lot that can

1560
01:12:17,630 --> 01:12:21,800
go into breeding I think more people are

1561
01:12:19,399 --> 01:12:24,889
getting into it which is great I love it

1562
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:27,680
when I talk to people who are growing in

1563
01:12:24,890 --> 01:12:30,950
greenhouses and they're like yeah we're

1564
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:33,890
we are actively working on breeding

1565
01:12:30,949 --> 01:12:37,460
plants to grow in a greenhouse

1566
01:12:33,890 --> 01:12:43,400
environment as opposed to trying to take

1567
01:12:37,460 --> 01:12:47,060
an indoor stream and ask it to to grow

1568
01:12:43,399 --> 01:12:49,789
well in a greenhouse which is completely

1569
01:12:47,060 --> 01:12:51,620
different than an indoor facility sure

1570
01:12:49,789 --> 01:12:54,019
we do we have a ton of genetic diversity

1571
01:12:51,619 --> 01:12:55,639
right now in cannabis with this plant

1572
01:12:54,020 --> 01:12:56,510
and

1573
01:12:55,639 --> 01:13:00,469
so you bring up some really good points

1574
01:12:56,510 --> 01:13:02,000
there and I would add that in by going

1575
01:13:00,469 --> 01:13:03,739
with these smaller rooms we can control

1576
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:06,560
workflows better too so we could harvest

1577
01:13:03,738 --> 01:13:08,149
say you know each room every 10 to 14

1578
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:09,350
days or whatever schedule makes sense

1579
01:13:08,149 --> 01:13:11,329
and then we don't have plants at

1580
01:13:09,350 --> 01:13:14,210
different ages going into a giant room

1581
01:13:11,329 --> 01:13:17,868
where we'll never get control of a pest

1582
01:13:14,210 --> 01:13:19,130
or pathogen and we don't have the

1583
01:13:17,868 --> 01:13:20,539
ability to really clean the room if

1584
01:13:19,130 --> 01:13:22,279
you're going with the perpetual harvest

1585
01:13:20,539 --> 01:13:25,600
which is why I don't like these big

1586
01:13:22,279 --> 01:13:28,039
rooms and it does sound like right from

1587
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:29,690
HVAC perspective there are challenges

1588
01:13:28,039 --> 01:13:31,850
when you get to be a certain size in

1589
01:13:29,689 --> 01:13:34,460
terms of having a homogeneous

1590
01:13:31,850 --> 01:13:39,139
environment late like like you discuss

1591
01:13:34,460 --> 01:13:41,689
so you know we didn't even get into VPD

1592
01:13:39,139 --> 01:13:43,159
or greenhouse environments and I as

1593
01:13:41,689 --> 01:13:45,379
someone who has a greenhouse I did have

1594
01:13:43,158 --> 01:13:47,210
some questions for you on that maybe I

1595
01:13:45,380 --> 01:13:48,889
could do a follow-up interview with you

1596
01:13:47,210 --> 01:13:50,980
and discuss some of those topics and

1597
01:13:48,889 --> 01:13:53,029
also get some questions from listeners

1598
01:13:50,979 --> 01:13:55,939
absolutely that'd be awesome

1599
01:13:53,029 --> 01:14:00,079
I mean greenhouses can be a completely

1600
01:13:55,939 --> 01:14:02,479
different topic instead of parameters I

1601
01:14:00,079 --> 01:14:04,969
mean ultimately we're controlling the

1602
01:14:02,479 --> 01:14:09,368
environment of course but once the Sun

1603
01:14:04,969 --> 01:14:11,448
comes into play it's it's a game changer

1604
01:14:09,368 --> 01:14:17,448
it's definitely worth its own

1605
01:14:11,448 --> 01:14:18,888
conversation yeah aye-aye-aye

1606
01:14:17,448 --> 01:14:20,750
I know I have a lot of challenges

1607
01:14:18,889 --> 01:14:22,699
growing tomatoes and cucumbers and

1608
01:14:20,750 --> 01:14:24,829
peppers in our greenhouse and in terms

1609
01:14:22,698 --> 01:14:26,299
of regulating temperature and

1610
01:14:24,829 --> 01:14:28,550
environment so I look forward to

1611
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:30,350
chatting about that but I don't want to

1612
01:14:28,550 --> 01:14:33,289
make this particular podcast too long

1613
01:14:30,350 --> 01:14:35,600
but I would love to follow up so if

1614
01:14:33,289 --> 01:14:39,889
that's possible I will reach out here

1615
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:42,039
again soon and be in touch that sounds

1616
01:14:39,889 --> 01:14:42,039
great

1617
01:14:43,109 --> 01:14:48,219
that was Nadia Sava also known as dr.

1618
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:50,590
greenhouse you can find her on Instagram

1619
01:14:48,220 --> 01:14:51,820
under the handle dr. greenhouse be sure

1620
01:14:50,590 --> 01:14:53,890
to give her a follow because she's

1621
01:14:51,819 --> 01:14:55,659
always offering new classes and speaking

1622
01:14:53,890 --> 01:14:57,039
around the country and I will be doing a

1623
01:14:55,659 --> 01:14:58,510
follow up with her but it's going to be

1624
01:14:57,039 --> 01:15:00,519
a month or so out due to scheduling

1625
01:14:58,510 --> 01:15:02,050
conflicts I am looking forward though to

1626
01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:04,840
