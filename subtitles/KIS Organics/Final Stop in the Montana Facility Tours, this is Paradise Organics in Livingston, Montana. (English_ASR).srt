thanks how many different flower rooms

22
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:00,919
do you have I've got six flower rooms

23
00:00:59,558 --> 00:01:03,038
okay

24
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:05,599
three bedrooms and you guys just kind of

25
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,359
retrofitted to this correct building

26
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:10,399
correct yeah

27
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:12,118
I yeah this is our little clone area

28
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,200
this this area works really nice it

29
00:01:12,118 --> 00:01:16,280
keeps it really good and humid got the

30
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:19,280
Periodic Table of cannabis I don't think

31
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:22,359
that's uh really anything that's uh we

32
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,879
use it's just kind of cool um Cameron

33
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:26,239
the kid that I was showing you he's very

34
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:28,599
very good with keeping all of our clones

35
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:29,959
clean he's very meticulous with the

36
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:32,359
cleaning process with everything

37
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:35,719
everything he gets everything sparkling

38
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:37,118
clean there's it's and and just how his

39
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:40,039
attention to

40
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:42,319
detail is amazing so he's he's the Clone

41
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,880
man that's important got some new seeds

42
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:46,319
here these ones are just getting munched

43
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:47,959
by thrips thrips are the one thing that

44
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:50,359
I've been having a hard time getting rid

45
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:53,919
of as everyone does but some new seeds

46
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:56,118
some new genetics okay from CSI humble

47
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,399
but yeah uh we are required by law to

48
00:01:56,118 --> 00:02:02,039
tag our plants when they get to 12 in

49
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:03,960
and I've gotten ticketed for having them

50
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:05,799
not tagged at like 10 inches so I just

51
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:07,679
tag basically everything you'll see the

52
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:10,280
tags in the dirt for a little bit once

53
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,800
the plant gets a little stronger I'll uh

54
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:16,800
put them up I used to clean these up

55
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:20,120
pretty pretty like immediately um one

56
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,280
thing that I've kind of done is I've let

57
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:24,159
the plants go a little bit longer before

58
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,919
hacking into them and it seems like it's

59
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:30,318
done better both for hlb spread and just

60
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:33,839
the Vigor of the plant okay

61
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:36,759
so as I was saying we are currently

62
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,719
growing too many plants in a and and

63
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:40,679
we've

64
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:43,639
got 4 to 500 plants in flower at all

65
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:46,040
times got about 1,600 in veg so these

66
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:48,598
ones the ones with a little discolor we

67
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:50,000
just get kind of we're constantly

68
00:02:48,598 --> 00:02:51,199
keeping up with transplanting we're just

69
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,560
transplanting transplanting

70
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:55,280
transplanting transplanting all the time

71
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,759
and the ones that you see that are a

72
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,400
little yellow here uh they're just one

73
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:01,079
of these cultivars that gets hungry

74
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,599
faster you know they're they're

75
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:06,480
something that the blueberry Silver Tip

76
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:09,399
It uh it's it's really great stuff but

77
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:12,439
some cultivars just get hungrier faster

78
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:14,158
and as you see we got uh the dog punch

79
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:16,479
here that looks fine it's almost a

80
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:17,919
bigger plant than these but these things

81
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:19,639
are probably going to get transplanted

82
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:23,079
in the next couple

83
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:25,639
days moving on we will go to budro one

84
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:28,959
now you're not uh topping the plants or

85
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:31,279
uh anything like that I top the plants

86
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:35,799
for only certain cultivars when I need

87
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:37,318
to but usually um if if if they're

88
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:40,280
getting to a point where there's so much

89
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:41,798
of a Christmas tree I'll I kind of like

90
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,598
to low stress train them and give them a

91
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:47,280
little Bend before I top them just

92
00:03:44,598 --> 00:03:48,479
because I'm scared of spreading hlv okay

93
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,438
you're

94
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:54,119
okay Stan this is Tad Tad Stan me nice

95
00:03:52,438 --> 00:03:56,318
to meet you all

96
00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:00,640
good glad you to have you here I

97
00:03:56,318 --> 00:04:01,878
appreciate it thanks for the tour so um

98
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:03,399
you were saying that you were you were

99
00:04:01,878 --> 00:04:06,919
able to control the hlv a little bit

100
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:08,519
better by hand pring rather than

101
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:10,878
pinching rather than using the scissors

102
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:14,000
that worked for you and I've had data to

103
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:17,120
back it up yeah like I've cuz we do I

104
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:21,000
try to test about 10 plants through Tumi

105
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:23,800
genetics every month or two just to keep

106
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,360
an eye on how much we hlv we have and

107
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:29,199
we're spreading and since I've stopped

108
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,038
cleaning up all the bottoms of my veg

109
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:34,759
plants as fast and since I've stopped

110
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:38,120
topping these plants with scissors yeah

111
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:40,400
I've seen less hlv and I've had less hlb

112
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,800
and I've got the data to back it up so

113
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:43,359
that's why it's like and I know some

114
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,439
Growers cleaning your scissors in

115
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,199
between plant cuts and things like that

116
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:50,719
too we have yes yes absolutely

117
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:52,478
absolutely and I've I've had to ride my

118
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:56,639
guys hard on it cuz it's a pain in the

119
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:56,639
ass but it is so important

120
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:04,199
yeah

121
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:06,758
this is a room that we just loaded um

122
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:09,800
I'm doing uh this is you're you're going

123
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:12,038
to see rooms with both HPS and LEDs what

124
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,560
we do right now is I just I put blue

125
00:05:12,038 --> 00:05:15,240
lights down the middle for the first

126
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,439
couple weeks that really I mean the

127
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,400
plants are going to be stressed and a

128
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:20,719
little

129
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:22,758
upset initially right off the bat but

130
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,240
that white light helps them quite a bit

131
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:31,479
this was the room that I've had my as

132
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:33,519
perilis fail in and um I I know that we

133
00:05:31,478 --> 00:05:36,038
have different opinions about our cover

134
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:38,279
crop inside I totally understand why

135
00:05:36,038 --> 00:05:40,199
especially after having the is pods but

136
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:42,079
it was the cycle that I did not have

137
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:44,160
cover crop in here was when I failed for

138
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:46,000
ASP jillis which I forgot to mention

139
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,960
yesterday but listening to the Pod with

140
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,800
Steve Campbell pretty sure your podcast

141
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:53,799
he said something about like more cover

142
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,319
crop less asper jous which was it's

143
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:58,840
something where it's like maybe maybe

144
00:05:55,319 --> 00:06:01,360
not it's such a strange deal this is a

145
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:05,638
room where we have mainly all LEDs but I

146
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:08,759
have these HPS in um kind of in between

147
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:11,160
and once these plants really develop and

148
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:13,680
settle into flower I'll turn those HPS

149
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,880
on they are orange lights if I turn them

150
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,519
on right off the bat it really kind of

151
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:21,199
stresses the plants out and they look

152
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:24,198
not very happy what's your uh what's

153
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:26,800
your target like ppfda a

154
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:29,520
canopy what's my target ppfd on the

155
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,918
canopy we try to well these these led

156
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:34,399
these I think you can have them a couple

157
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:37,598
uh like a foot and a half I try to not

158
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:41,239
have more than mic like for 1100 micro

159
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:43,918
moles I think is that comparable to uh

160
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:45,879
ppfd okay yeah it's the same thing okay

161
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:47,959
so you're about 1100 there another thing

162
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:50,159
that I was kind of thinking about doing

163
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:52,560
was removing the first little bit of

164
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,439
these root balls which I don't do yet

165
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,360
but um I haven't had aspar jillis fails

166
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:59,120
in this room or anything of it by the

167
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,240
way this is all kiss Organics commercial

168
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,319
mix

169
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:06,598
soil but as you can see we do finally

170
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,199
defoliate our plants I did finally and

171
00:07:06,598 --> 00:07:10,719
this is kind of how we try to get them

172
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:12,079
all stacked up nice and we did just

173
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,120
water in here so there's water on the

174
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:19,000
ground but uh yeah

175
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:21,160
and I need to lower the lights and Bud

176
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,279
too a little bit cuz you see here these

177
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,439
lights are a little bit lower closer to

178
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:27,439
these

179
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:27,439
plants

180
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,479
uh yeah this has been one of our uh one

181
00:07:31,478 --> 00:07:37,719
of our best rooms with the old uh kiss

182
00:07:33,478 --> 00:07:40,758
Organics commercial mix what

183
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:43,840
uh how many days in the flower are you

184
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:43,840
oh let's look at the sheet I'll tell

185
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:53,680
you start date

186
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:58,280
8:22 so we are 1

187
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,280
month 5 days in flour

188
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,319
okay

189
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:14,879
so that's our mother area try to just

190
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:17,598
store genetics back here okay one thing

191
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:20,960
that I've done we spray this room every

192
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:22,639
3 or 4 days with hydrogen peroxide mix

193
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:28,478
it's

194
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:31,199
only 40 to 60 mil uh Ms in a 7,000 mil

195
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:33,439
tank so it's very small and a little bit

196
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:36,120
of prot too which is just a silica mix I

197
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:40,039
love doing silic mix sprays but that's

198
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:42,080
kept uh powdery mildew and every pest

199
00:08:40,038 --> 00:08:44,038
out of my life and it's it was something

200
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:49,120
that I've struggled with for years and

201
00:08:44,038 --> 00:08:52,759
years of spraying stff oil neem oil

202
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,320
peppermint tweetment tvia oil everything

203
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:57,120
and I was like I cannot get rid of these

204
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,320
things turns out hydrogen peroxide and I

205
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,039
and I never really UND or I never really

206
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,800
liked it was like seems like a bad

207
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:05,039
chemical thing but once I really learned

208
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:08,439
and looked into it's just liquid oxygen

209
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:10,399
and it's not it's not too bad so I I'm

210
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:12,040
very happy with the results that that

211
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,759
gives me it doesn't leave a residue on

212
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:17,480
the leaf either so how long does it take

213
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:20,000
you to get your plants to this size

214
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:22,200
they're what about 5T tall depending on

215
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,879
the cultivar we uh we write down the

216
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:28,120
transplant dates on the on the piece of

217
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:31,838
paper so this one was 718 and when it

218
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:36,600
got put into a one gon pot and then 94

219
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:39,839
it got put into this uh 5 gon pot so

220
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:41,600
okay two months ago this plant was Tiny

221
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,760
just just out of the cloner and it

222
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,079
depends obviously some cultivars take

223
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:46,799
longer than others and that's why I like

224
00:09:45,078 --> 00:09:49,879
to have the yeah are you feeding them

225
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:51,159
any other nutrients besides what's in

226
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:51,919
the soil already what you're putting in

227
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:57,600
the

228
00:09:51,919 --> 00:10:01,439
soil yes uh we have a book of compost

229
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:03,200
teas and if if uh depending on the

230
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,360
cultivar sometimes I'll know cultivars

231
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,680
eat a lot more and I'll give them a

232
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:08,680
little top dress um

233
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:14,759
but these are

234
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:17,759
te's I just a bunch of recipes that I

235
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:17,759
made this is one of our

236
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,640
favorites the hippie hater the hippie

237
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:27,838
hater okay it's uh and as you can see

238
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:30,679
our homemade tea tank you know it's uh I

239
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,519
used to have a 250 gallon one but I I

240
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:34,759
feel like the 120 just works a little

241
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:38,240
better for us right here our boards kind

242
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:40,039
of like everything on the uh walls I if

243
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,278
there's no water in a room we got no

244
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:45,480
water if it got sprayed harvested loaded

245
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:47,679
everything I just try to cuz having

246
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,879
information available for everyone yeah

247
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:51,599
is good it means that there's the lack

248
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:53,120
of communication doesn't happen as much

249
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,600
and it's like oh what do you mean you

250
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,919
watered that room we just watered that

251
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,040
room that doesn't happen when we have a

252
00:10:55,919 --> 00:11:00,360
board telling exactly what's going on

253
00:10:58,039 --> 00:11:03,000
nice

254
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:06,278
so everything that gets done whether

255
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,078
it's water pruning top dress we write it

256
00:11:06,278 --> 00:11:10,278
down if it's in here we're writing it

257
00:11:08,078 --> 00:11:13,199
down and the inspector loves this too I

258
00:11:10,278 --> 00:11:16,000
print out every sheet of where it is

259
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,839
Phase date everything in here so when we

260
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,399
do get inspected it's easy everything's

261
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:23,480
right where it needs to be but this is

262
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:26,000
great if I end up having a problem or it

263
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:28,039
was a really good run I can uh go back

264
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,000
and be like what did I do differently

265
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:33,360
and also is I have the last couple years

266
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,240
of everything that we've done and I can

267
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,159
match it up to test results too and it

268
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,839
really helps me kind of follow

269
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:40,120
scientific method of control like taking

270
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:42,560
one thing out and putting one thing back

271
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:44,600
in actually seeing the result from all

272
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:46,479
of us here at Paradise Organics we'd

273
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,360
