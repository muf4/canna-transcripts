hey guys it's Dad here with kiss

2
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:06,660
Organics I want to do a follow-up to my

3
00:00:04,679 --> 00:00:10,218
trivia post yesterday this was the photo

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:13,199
in question and you can see the unique

5
00:00:10,218 --> 00:00:16,138
swelling and no the nodes on this plant

6
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:18,118
it almost looks like uh Galls some

7
00:00:16,138 --> 00:00:19,379
people guess that it was super cropping

8
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:23,118
however these plants have never been

9
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:27,299
super cropped and we do have a positive

10
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:30,839
HP lvd test or hlvd that's the Hop

11
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,700
latent's thyroid that is supporting this

12
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:33,840
result

13
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:36,479
you know many of you are familiar now

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,520
with hops Layton unfortunately it's

15
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:39,898
becoming more and more common and I'm

16
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,899
happy to do a separate post talking

17
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:44,600
about spread and decontamination and all

18
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:46,920
of those things as well

19
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,899
I was waiting to make this post because

20
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,539
I wanted to get a second confirmation

21
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:53,579
from Dr Jack Munns over at Three Rivers

22
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:57,058
biotech that's who does our testing for

23
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:59,280
us through our website and I did do a

24
00:00:57,058 --> 00:01:00,599
podcast with them a little while back so

25
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,859
you can go check that out if you want to

26
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:08,760
hear more about virus and virus testing

27
00:01:03,859 --> 00:01:10,739
but we are seeing with the hlvd a

28
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,780
variety of symptoms in cannabis plants

29
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:15,719
you know the plant may appear healthy

30
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,460
while the viroid lays dormant until the

31
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:19,379
plant appears to encounter some sort of

32
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:21,719
environmental stress and then we see

33
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:25,319
symptoms ranging from loss of potency

34
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:27,239
yellowing misshapen leaves stunting the

35
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:28,978
plant's inability support itself and

36
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:31,739
just a general brittle or weak stem

37
00:01:28,978 --> 00:01:34,079
structure and in some cases the swelling

38
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:36,359
at the nodes so it's really important

39
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:41,039
that you are observant of your plant

40
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:43,259
that you do consistent testing in order

41
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:47,040
to make sure that you have confidence in

42
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:49,379
clean material and one of the

43
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,060
interesting findings that is coming out

44
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:53,640
in research right now

45
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:56,280
and this is something that I just did a

46
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,500
podcast with Suzanne Wainwright Evans uh

47
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,840
the bug lady sharing some of the hemp

48
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,819
research that she heard at a recent uh

49
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,478
private hemp conference and that's

50
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:10,579
essentially that the root tissue may be

51
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:12,919
a more reliable source of viroid testing

52
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:16,560
for hplv

53
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:18,419
then the up above ground Leaf biomass

54
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,520
and what their findings were were

55
00:02:18,419 --> 00:02:22,738
essentially that

56
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:25,379
um and she'll she gives a number in the

57
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:27,539
podcast interview but essentially many

58
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:29,399
of the plants tested negative for the

59
00:02:27,539 --> 00:02:32,519
viroid when they tested the leaf tissue

60
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:34,500
and then they would test the root tissue

61
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,980
and they found that the roots would test

62
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:39,598
the root samples would test positive

63
00:02:36,979 --> 00:02:42,179
whereas none of the plants that where

64
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:45,479
the roots tested negative did the leaf

65
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:47,400
tissue test positive so there's a lot of

66
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:49,439
there's a lot of reasons there to test

67
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,900
the root tissue to get a more reliable

68
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:52,560
result potentially

69
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,239
um

70
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,159
so I thought that was really interesting

71
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,400
research that interview is already

72
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:01,560
available on our new patreon

73
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,739
um the raw footage but the actual

74
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,959
podcast interview will be coming out uh

75
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:09,719
probably this week or next week at the

76
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,340
latest so if people are interested let

77
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:13,919
me know I can try and track down more

78
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:16,500
information about uh

79
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:18,539
this viroid viral disinfection best

80
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,539
practices and put together another post

81
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:23,299
or even maybe another podcast around it

82
00:03:20,539 --> 00:03:25,919
but reach out if you have any questions

83
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:27,000
and I just wanted to share and and for

84
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:29,518
those of you that participate I just

85
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,919
want to say thanks you know whatever the

86
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,599
the guess is or the comments

87
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:35,219
um you know it's really about just going

88
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:37,018
through the mental process of thinking

89
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:38,340
about how to approach your garden what

90
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:39,780
some of the variables are what some of

91
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,979
the things it could be

92
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,780
um so honestly you know if you get it

93
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:44,399
wrong don't sweat it I get these things

94
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,959
wrong all the time I'm constantly

95
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,599
learning and I hope we can all continue

96
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:51,739
to learn from each other so thanks

97
00:03:48,598 --> 00:03:51,738
everyone have a great day
