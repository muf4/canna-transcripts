00:00:14,718 --> 00:00:18,239
welcome to the cannabis cultivation and

3
00:00:17,129 --> 00:00:21,329
science podcast

4
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:23,729
I'm your host tad hussy of kis organics

5
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:25,439
this is the podcast where we discuss the

6
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,330
cutting edge of organic growing from a

7
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,278
science-based perspective and draw on

8
00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:31,948
top experts from around the industry to

9
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:33,929
share their wisdom and knowledge I hope

10
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:35,789
everyone had a wonderful holiday and I'm

11
00:00:33,929 --> 00:00:38,670
excited to be back making podcasts for

12
00:00:35,789 --> 00:00:40,259
2018 we have a great lineup of guests

13
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,390
for future interviews ranging from the

14
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:44,820
latest in lighting technology to soil

15
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:47,520
testing permaculture lean farming

16
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,200
outdoor cultivation and much more this

17
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,640
podcast though is about a subject that

18
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,920
many people probably don't give a lot of

19
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,049
thought to but it's important aspect of

20
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,920
cultivation here with me today is

21
00:00:55,049 --> 00:00:58,019
William Evans

22
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,910
I met William actually through Suzanne

23
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,129
Wainwright Evans the entomologist from

24
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:03,898
my last podcast when we were talking off

25
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:05,548
air she said you have to meet my husband

26
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:07,109
and we started talking about what he

27
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:09,479
does and it seemed like a perfect fit

28
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:11,129
for the podcast William has been working

29
00:01:09,478 --> 00:01:13,590
in the horticulture and nursery industry

30
00:01:11,129 --> 00:01:16,140
for over 20 years and brings a wealth of

31
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:18,210
experience to the table this podcast is

32
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,310
not the most glamorous of subjects but

33
00:01:18,209 --> 00:01:23,069
one that deserves some attention today's

34
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:24,420
podcast is all about containers while

35
00:01:23,069 --> 00:01:26,039
I've been a proponent of planting

36
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,740
directly into the ground when possible

37
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,810
this is not an option in many situations

38
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:33,390
and propagation is best done in small

39
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,950
trays or containers William will share

40
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:37,439
with us how containers can dramatically

41
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,780
reduce transplant shock improve worker

42
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:42,179
efficiency increase plant health and a

43
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:43,859
myriad of other benefits we also talk

44
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,990
about how the wrong container can cause

45
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:48,118
major issues resulting in poor growth

46
00:01:45,989 --> 00:01:49,618
route girdling and even the potential

47
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:52,049
for your container being a source of

48
00:01:49,618 --> 00:01:54,540
contamination without further adue

49
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:57,149
though here's our interview okay hello

50
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:59,189
Ted hi thanks for taking the time to do

51
00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:01,290
this today I really appreciate it so I

52
00:01:59,188 --> 00:02:04,139
wanted to talk to you today about these

53
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:06,780
fertile pots sure can you give me a

54
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:09,449
little bit of background into how you

55
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,890
came across the product and your history

56
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:12,780
with it and then a little more about how

57
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:13,229
it's made my personal history with it

58
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,908
was

59
00:02:13,229 --> 00:02:18,238
I was working for a distributor that was

60
00:02:14,908 --> 00:02:20,899
selling them in Pennsylvania a long time

61
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:23,158
ago in another lifetime it seems

62
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:25,349
fertility that's been manufacturing

63
00:02:23,158 --> 00:02:28,109
these pots since 1960

64
00:02:25,348 --> 00:02:29,939
so it's it's over 50 years now they've

65
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:31,739
always been manufactured on the east

66
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:33,750
side of France the reason that the

67
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:37,230
factory is there is because they're made

68
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,959
primarily of spruce fibres and the the

69
00:02:37,229 --> 00:02:42,810
forests in the area there have a lot of

70
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:45,590
spruce and so the the the factory is

71
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:48,390
competing with companies that are making

72
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:50,400
firewood and timber and pulp paper and

73
00:02:48,389 --> 00:02:52,559
things like that and they they buy the

74
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,739
the firewood they buy the logs from the

75
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,900
local wood cutters and then process them

76
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:59,878
there and make them into pots so these

77
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,319
pots are made of spruce are there any

78
00:02:59,878 --> 00:03:04,590
other ingredients in the containers

79
00:03:01,318 --> 00:03:08,729
themselves there is a little bit of peat

80
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:10,799
about 20% or so it fluctuates a little

81
00:03:08,729 --> 00:03:12,358
bit there and there's three to four

82
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:15,150
percent limestone that's in there to

83
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:17,069
buffer the pH of the pots there is a new

84
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:20,159
version of these that's being introduced

85
00:03:17,068 --> 00:03:21,598
which is a peat free pot which is a

86
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,250
hundred percent wood fibers there's a

87
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:25,168
couple different blends of wood fiber

88
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:27,659
but again it's it's primarily spruce

89
00:03:25,169 --> 00:03:29,340
fiber and there's some maritime pine in

90
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:31,289
there as well but then again it's it's

91
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,759
it's all wood fibers that's the that's

92
00:03:31,289 --> 00:03:34,560
the main thing so it's probably easier

93
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:35,909
to refer them as a wood fiber pot and

94
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,068
these pots are a hundred percent

95
00:03:35,909 --> 00:03:39,539
biodegradable absolutely yeah there's

96
00:03:38,068 --> 00:03:41,429
there's nothing synthetic in there

97
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:43,828
whatsoever and they're approved for use

98
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:45,989
in organic production too I believe yes

99
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:47,340
both versions are armory listed the

100
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:49,650
organic materials review Institute

101
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,569
that's in Eugene Oregon they put you

102
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:54,419
through a pretty rigorous process of

103
00:03:51,568 --> 00:03:56,729
examining where your raw materials come

104
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:59,879
from how they are sourced how you

105
00:03:56,729 --> 00:04:02,280
process them etc in order to be able to

106
00:03:59,878 --> 00:04:04,018
get an armory listing which army

107
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,209
listings will certify that you are

108
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:09,930
approved for use in the National Organic

109
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:11,069
Program run by the USDA it doesn't

110
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:13,230
necessarily mean that your product is

111
00:04:11,068 --> 00:04:15,448
organic it means that your product is

112
00:04:13,229 --> 00:04:17,788
approved for use in organics there's a

113
00:04:15,449 --> 00:04:19,530
big distinction between an input and an

114
00:04:17,788 --> 00:04:21,509
output as far as the USDA is concerned

115
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:22,829
fertile pot will be considered an input

116
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:24,598
and it must be approved for use in

117
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:26,589
organics the only thing that can be

118
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:30,009
outputs are actually something

119
00:04:26,589 --> 00:04:32,679
is grown or produced from plant or

120
00:04:30,009 --> 00:04:34,240
animals yes so our soil for example I'm

121
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,040
working on getting it approved for use

122
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,660
in organic production it can actually be

123
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,460
certified organic for the reasons that

124
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:41,740
you're saying it's a sort of a

125
00:04:39,459 --> 00:04:43,418
bureaucratic labeling issue they're

126
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:45,819
correct but it has to be approved for

127
00:04:43,418 --> 00:04:47,469
use in organics so you have to go

128
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:49,089
through the whole process I'm sure

129
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:50,770
you're dealing with that now yes so

130
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:53,349
before we get into some of the

131
00:04:50,769 --> 00:04:55,089
differences between fertile pots and

132
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:56,320
some of these other types of containers

133
00:04:55,089 --> 00:04:58,478
can we talk a little bit about what the

134
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:00,728
main benefits are well the main benefit

135
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:03,099
to fertile pot is really the porosity of

136
00:05:00,728 --> 00:05:04,629
the wall of the container and to try to

137
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:06,939
help you understand what that's

138
00:05:04,629 --> 00:05:09,550
important why that's important is that

139
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:11,740
when you plant something in this pot

140
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:13,509
whether you put it in from a plug or you

141
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:15,850
put it in from a seed or a cutting you

142
00:05:13,509 --> 00:05:17,918
know however you start when the roots

143
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:19,300
reach go through the soil that's in the

144
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:21,849
pot and they reach the edge of the pot

145
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:24,160
because the wall of the pot is about 85%

146
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:26,470
porous the roots are going to pass

147
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,510
straight through straightaway the pot

148
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:30,370
wall is so porous that we don't even put

149
00:05:28,509 --> 00:05:31,418
drain holes in the pots we don't cut

150
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:33,939
drain holes into the box because we

151
00:05:31,418 --> 00:05:35,949
don't need them and why that's important

152
00:05:33,939 --> 00:05:38,199
is because it's going to develop a

153
00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:39,879
natural root structure that is going to

154
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:42,519
allow the roots to develop as if they

155
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:44,079
were in the native soil the advantage to

156
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:45,639
them going through the pot is that as

157
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:48,418
they penetrate the pot in the encounter

158
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:50,860
air you're going to get root pruning and

159
00:05:48,418 --> 00:05:52,629
so the air is basically stunting the

160
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:54,788
apical dominance or the desire of the

161
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:56,589
root to grow forward and preventing it

162
00:05:54,788 --> 00:05:59,319
from going forward the root naturally

163
00:05:56,589 --> 00:06:00,668
forces lateral branching so just like if

164
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:02,589
you say you had a basil plant and you

165
00:06:00,668 --> 00:06:04,120
pinch the top of the basil plant you're

166
00:06:02,589 --> 00:06:05,829
stunting the apical dominance of that

167
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:08,129
basil plant there and the result of it

168
00:06:05,829 --> 00:06:10,509
is it branches out so you get a bushier

169
00:06:08,129 --> 00:06:11,949
bushier basil plant the same thing

170
00:06:10,509 --> 00:06:13,509
happens with the root structure so as

171
00:06:11,949 --> 00:06:15,699
the roots are penetrating the wall apart

172
00:06:13,509 --> 00:06:17,228
air is doing the pruning it's it's

173
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:18,969
basically stunting the able the

174
00:06:17,228 --> 00:06:21,159
dominance and it's forcing the roots to

175
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:22,510
branch out and remember the tip of the

176
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,400
root is the only point that actually

177
00:06:22,509 --> 00:06:26,079
does any work on a plant that's where

178
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:28,750
the nutrients are uptake and the

179
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:31,050
moisture is uptaken so if you have more

180
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:33,728
root tips as a written response to the

181
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:34,960
pruning process you have two things with

182
00:06:33,728 --> 00:06:36,399
a fertile pot you have a natural

183
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:37,269
structure because it's not being

184
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:38,918
containerized

185
00:06:37,269 --> 00:06:40,329
it's not it's not turning inside a

186
00:06:38,918 --> 00:06:41,829
plastic wall

187
00:06:40,329 --> 00:06:43,598
and then you have an enhanced natural

188
00:06:41,829 --> 00:06:46,209
root structure because of the pruning

189
00:06:43,598 --> 00:06:48,339
process so you having a better better

190
00:06:46,209 --> 00:06:50,258
ability of that plant to uptake

191
00:06:48,339 --> 00:06:52,089
nutrients and moisture and when you take

192
00:06:50,259 --> 00:06:54,038
that pot and you put it into the next

193
00:06:52,089 --> 00:06:55,659
larger container or into the native

194
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:57,430
landscape as you're transplanting it all

195
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:59,169
the apical dominance that's on the

196
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:00,759
outside of that on those those roots

197
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:03,189
that were on the outside of the pot will

198
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:05,680
return and the plant will grow faster

199
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:07,449
into that next larger container or into

200
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,038
the native landscape because of the fact

201
00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:12,098
of the type of root structure that it's

202
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:14,079
got behind it so we see a lot of photos

203
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:15,788
online or in forms and you see people

204
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:17,050
with showing off the roots of their

205
00:07:15,788 --> 00:07:19,180
plants and the roots are starting to

206
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:22,090
wrap around the inside of a traditional

207
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:23,769
container and what essentially you're

208
00:07:22,089 --> 00:07:26,049
talking about here is by having that

209
00:07:23,769 --> 00:07:29,549
root stopped growing and starting a new

210
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:32,139
tip we're actually increasing the

211
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:33,939
fertility of that plant or its ability

212
00:07:32,139 --> 00:07:35,769
to take up nutrients correct you're

213
00:07:33,939 --> 00:07:37,538
increasing the ability for it to uptake

214
00:07:35,769 --> 00:07:38,709
nutrients and moisture a lot of these

215
00:07:37,538 --> 00:07:40,000
photos that you see where they show you

216
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:41,918
there's massive amounts of roots

217
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,288
wrapping around that's actually a really

218
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:46,839
a bad thing because two things one is

219
00:07:44,288 --> 00:07:48,430
that the energy of the plant is being

220
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:50,319
forced into apical a dominant roots

221
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:52,389
which really again the tip of the roots

222
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,339
the only important point of this so you

223
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:55,718
have all the rest that reaches carrying

224
00:07:54,339 --> 00:07:58,029
the nutrients moisture up to the plant

225
00:07:55,718 --> 00:07:59,439
so if you've got a wrapped around if

226
00:07:58,029 --> 00:08:03,158
they're if they're encountering a solid

227
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:04,899
wall during a plastic wall or a pot that

228
00:08:03,158 --> 00:08:06,250
needs drain holes cut into it they're

229
00:08:04,899 --> 00:08:07,359
going to turn in they're gonna circle

230
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:09,250
and that's going to set up a pattern

231
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,319
that's very difficult for the plant to

232
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:13,149
break out of when you put it into the

233
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:15,189
next larger container that's why often

234
00:08:13,149 --> 00:08:16,478
times you'll get directions when you see

235
00:08:15,189 --> 00:08:17,529
when you see when you get a plastic pot

236
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:19,629
they'll say well pull it out of the

237
00:08:17,529 --> 00:08:21,399
plastic pot and take a knife and score

238
00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:22,509
the roots and the reason that you're

239
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:24,038
trying to score the roots is you're

240
00:08:22,509 --> 00:08:25,930
trying to break that containerized

241
00:08:24,038 --> 00:08:28,598
structure that's been set up by the

242
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:29,889
plastic pot so of course you realize

243
00:08:28,598 --> 00:08:31,300
that's damage to the root structure

244
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:33,788
that's that's setting the plant back

245
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:35,620
you're going to get transplant shock in

246
00:08:33,788 --> 00:08:37,088
other words the plants gonna it's going

247
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:38,889
to survive when you plant it but it's

248
00:08:37,089 --> 00:08:40,690
not going to thrive because the roots

249
00:08:38,889 --> 00:08:42,458
have to regenerate and form into

250
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:44,920
something that can be used by the plant

251
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:46,509
again so yeah apical dominant roots are

252
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:48,338
really a bad thing and a lot of people

253
00:08:46,509 --> 00:08:50,439
get them confused with you know good

254
00:08:48,339 --> 00:08:52,760
root structure yeah you know growing up

255
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:55,160
with my parents awning a retail nursery

256
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:57,590
I you know I had 20 years ago he was

257
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:59,569
teaching me how to transplant the plant

258
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:01,220
and that process involved essentially

259
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:03,410
taking a rubella plant and really

260
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:05,060
ripping the roots apart very

261
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:07,850
aggressively with a knife with your

262
00:09:05,059 --> 00:09:10,129
fingers and just if you didn't do that

263
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:12,290
that plant would stay in the shape of

264
00:09:10,129 --> 00:09:14,480
that pot like if I took a traditional

265
00:09:12,289 --> 00:09:15,889
plastic plant growing a plastic

266
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,450
container and didn't break up those

267
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:19,279
roots that were root bound and planted

268
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:21,379
that plant it would eventually it would

269
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,059
eventually die anyway because the roots

270
00:09:21,379 --> 00:09:24,529
aren't able to break out of that shape

271
00:09:23,059 --> 00:09:26,839
and actually reach out into the other

272
00:09:24,529 --> 00:09:28,789
you know the the natural soil or native

273
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:31,129
soil in extreme conditions is called

274
00:09:28,789 --> 00:09:32,689
root girdling where the roots that have

275
00:09:31,129 --> 00:09:34,759
set up in this containerized structure

276
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:36,080
as they grow and they get bigger they

277
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:38,509
get fatter and fatter and eventually

278
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,160
they actually choke each other off so

279
00:09:38,509 --> 00:09:42,110
that you really it's like a choke hold

280
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:44,899
that's created by the plant on itself

281
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:46,940
due to the the shape of the root

282
00:09:44,899 --> 00:09:48,590
structure that you put into the ground

283
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:50,150
that's why yeah your dad would tell you

284
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:51,860
to you know tear the bottom of it and

285
00:09:50,149 --> 00:09:53,990
pull these roots apart but I mean you

286
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:55,669
can imagine how much stress that is on

287
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:57,830
the plant would it be nicer to just take

288
00:09:55,669 --> 00:09:59,719
the entire good root structure with a

289
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:01,430
with a natural chuck sure enhancer

290
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:03,649
natural root structure and put it right

291
00:10:01,429 --> 00:10:05,419
into the next container and let it

292
00:10:03,649 --> 00:10:06,860
continue growing the plant doesn't even

293
00:10:05,419 --> 00:10:08,179
know that it's been transplanted because

294
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:09,529
it really hasn't been you know

295
00:10:08,179 --> 00:10:10,909
quote-unquote transplant has just been

296
00:10:09,529 --> 00:10:12,589
given a little more room to grow now

297
00:10:10,909 --> 00:10:14,899
yeah so that when I first heard about

298
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:17,300
root pruning or air pruning as I've also

299
00:10:14,899 --> 00:10:20,419
heard it called was through smart pots

300
00:10:17,299 --> 00:10:21,769
or fabric containers and so we've

301
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:23,599
started we started using fabric

302
00:10:21,769 --> 00:10:26,240
containers only selling fabric

303
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,740
containers in our garden center but they

304
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,960
felt like an incomplete solution to me

305
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:32,120
for a few reasons one of them being is

306
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:34,190
that they're very challenging to

307
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:36,710
transplant out of trying to peel back

308
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:39,710
the fabric if you've ever done it it's a

309
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:42,139
real pain and try to pull the plant out

310
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:45,320
it's a lot of Labor I love the idea of

311
00:10:42,139 --> 00:10:47,090
being able to just transplant the plant

312
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:50,629
right into the ground and not have to

313
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:51,560
worry about that container you know it's

314
00:10:50,629 --> 00:10:54,379
because knowing it's going to break down

315
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:56,449
is was wonderful yeah if you're pulling

316
00:10:54,379 --> 00:11:00,139
a plant out of a plastic pot or peeling

317
00:10:56,450 --> 00:11:02,240
back a fabric wrapper you're you're

318
00:11:00,139 --> 00:11:03,830
you're breaking the little tips that are

319
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,870
always at the at the edge there you know

320
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:07,490
the very very very end of the

321
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:08,840
and that's going to cause transplant

322
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:10,399
shock but I mean of course with

323
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,690
something that doesn't biodegrade you

324
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,399
have to remove that because otherwise

325
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:13,790
it'll stay there forever and ever and

326
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:15,199
ever

327
00:11:13,789 --> 00:11:16,549
with the fertile pot you're just

328
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,710
planting it in the ground giving it a

329
00:11:16,549 --> 00:11:21,620
little more room to grow and there is no

330
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:23,930
transplant shock as far as labor goes in

331
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:26,360
doing that one of our biggest markets is

332
00:11:23,929 --> 00:11:29,719
actually landscape companies that are

333
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:32,120
installing large plantings and there's

334
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:34,790
generally about a 30% labor savings in

335
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:36,649
terms of the the labor costs of

336
00:11:34,789 --> 00:11:38,059
installing using fertile pot versus

337
00:11:36,649 --> 00:11:39,709
something that's coming out of a plastic

338
00:11:38,059 --> 00:11:41,299
pot or a pot that you're going to have

339
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:43,009
to manipulate in some way before you can

340
00:11:41,299 --> 00:11:44,179
put it into the ground because you're

341
00:11:43,009 --> 00:11:45,740
just putting the pot right into the

342
00:11:44,179 --> 00:11:47,989
ground put the soil on it and move on

343
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:49,669
there's no there's no removing the pot

344
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:51,320
there's no cleaning up at the end of the

345
00:11:49,669 --> 00:11:53,689
day there's no going to the dump at the

346
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:55,790
end of the day and in you know dropping

347
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:58,310
off thousands and thousands of plastic

348
00:11:55,789 --> 00:11:59,509
pots so just from a labor perspective

349
00:11:58,309 --> 00:12:01,339
there's a there's an advantage there

350
00:11:59,509 --> 00:12:03,200
well I think another big advantage too

351
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:05,120
is the amount of Education requires the

352
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,160
plant a plant or properly transplant

353
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:10,759
I've spent a lot of time teaching staff

354
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:12,709
how I want our plants transplant around

355
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:14,059
the around the nursery and that would

356
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:17,090
involve you know breaking up the roots

357
00:12:14,059 --> 00:12:18,229
and going through that whole process not

358
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:20,120
having the plant out of the container

359
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:23,450
before it's in the soil for very long

360
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:25,820
and being able to transplant with a

361
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:28,009
biodegradable pot where it doesn't have

362
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:29,750
to necessarily be the optimal transplant

363
00:12:28,009 --> 00:12:31,730
time if the plant hasn't filled that

364
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:33,679
container I'm not having to worry about

365
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:34,940
removing it and having all the soil fall

366
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:37,039
apart because there's not enough root

367
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:39,680
structure and I don't also on the same

368
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:41,059
note have to worry about it being a root

369
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:42,409
bound when I go to transplant it and

370
00:12:41,059 --> 00:12:44,899
like you mentioned having to break apart

371
00:12:42,409 --> 00:12:47,509
those roots so I love this idea

372
00:12:44,899 --> 00:12:50,000
yeah the root pruning will allow you to

373
00:12:47,509 --> 00:12:51,710
a bigger window of opportunity in terms

374
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,210
of when you actually have to transplant

375
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:55,070
because you're not going to get that you

376
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:56,720
know as you said container-bound plan

377
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:57,860
one thing that you do need to be aware

378
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,440
of when you plant a fertile pot

379
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:02,570
generally with any plant you want to

380
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,710
plant at the same grade you don't want

381
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:04,970
to bury the plant you don't want to

382
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:07,160
leave it you know raised up really high

383
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:08,960
so over time what can happen with a

384
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:10,279
fertile pot if you've filled it up with

385
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:12,440
soil you plant it in there and you've

386
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:15,529
grown in and the soil may have compacted

387
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:17,660
over the growing time so you end up with

388
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:19,319
a like a lip that's that's sticking up

389
00:13:17,659 --> 00:13:21,929
you don't want to you

390
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:23,010
want to plant that so deep that the lip

391
00:13:21,929 --> 00:13:24,449
is completely buried you're going to

392
00:13:23,009 --> 00:13:26,250
want to plant it at grade and then just

393
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:27,509
simply tear off the lip because remember

394
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:29,340
the fertile parts going to be very soft

395
00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:31,559
at this point you almost have to

396
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:34,110
consider it really more of a future root

397
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:35,429
ball that's that's not it's not

398
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:37,110
necessarily plant you can have to handle

399
00:13:35,429 --> 00:13:38,759
it a little bit differently so you know

400
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:40,649
grabbing it by the lip you might tear

401
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:42,539
that lip off because it's very soft

402
00:13:40,649 --> 00:13:44,189
whereas if you picked it up like a glass

403
00:13:42,539 --> 00:13:45,179
of water it's very easy to move around

404
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:47,760
but these are some of the considerations

405
00:13:45,179 --> 00:13:49,649
that you'll have to to be aware of when

406
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:51,240
using fertile pod versus say a plastic

407
00:13:49,649 --> 00:13:53,909
pot so let's talk about some of these

408
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:55,649
differences here now like I said I was

409
00:13:53,909 --> 00:13:57,149
familiar with fabric pots prior to

410
00:13:55,649 --> 00:13:59,189
learning about these fertile pots and

411
00:13:57,149 --> 00:14:01,649
some of the challenges I found was I

412
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:04,020
have a actual article on my blog about

413
00:14:01,649 --> 00:14:07,199
some independent testing that was shared

414
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:08,819
with me regarding the heavy metal

415
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:12,240
content of some of these fabric pots

416
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:14,280
coming out of China I do worry about the

417
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,139
even with these I haven't seen anything

418
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:18,240
on molded plastic pots but I do worry

419
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:20,250
about people growing edible crops in

420
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,500
some of these potential containers

421
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:24,330
because you know you're growing out in

422
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:26,490
the summer in ninety degree temperature

423
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:27,990
if those pots have BPA or other things

424
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:30,870
that can break down at high temperatures

425
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:32,580
I do worry about that so that would be

426
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:35,370
one one thing to be concerned about with

427
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:37,800
fabric or plastic pots another potential

428
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:39,360
issue there is root temperature I assume

429
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:42,209
the fertile pot would be better at

430
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,800
reducing reducing the heat compared to a

431
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:45,840
black plastic pot on a hot summer day or

432
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:48,089
is that a fact well there yeah it's a

433
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:49,830
double-edged sword it will be better at

434
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:51,629
reducing the temperatures however it's

435
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:53,790
also going to try out a lot faster than

436
00:14:51,629 --> 00:14:55,320
a plastic pot because remember the

437
00:14:53,789 --> 00:14:57,179
entire pot you have again you have to

438
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:59,220
think of this as a future root ball

439
00:14:57,179 --> 00:15:01,979
you're dealing with a way of holding

440
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:03,930
soil in shape while the plants develop

441
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:06,120
the roots penetrate the pot the putt day

442
00:15:03,929 --> 00:15:08,309
the plant and the pot become one and

443
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:10,019
there is no way to remove the pot at

444
00:15:08,309 --> 00:15:11,729
that point but it's also going to trans

445
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:14,909
evaporate across the entire surface of

446
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:16,800
the pot so while it works well say in

447
00:15:14,909 --> 00:15:19,049
sub irrigation systems where you've got

448
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:21,359
you put the pot in a you know a small

449
00:15:19,049 --> 00:15:23,669
low bath of water and it will wick up

450
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,379
like a sponge the opposite is also true

451
00:15:23,669 --> 00:15:27,659
so you do have to be careful about

452
00:15:25,379 --> 00:15:28,950
keeping the pots moist you don't want to

453
00:15:27,659 --> 00:15:30,929
let them just sit in the hot Sun and

454
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:32,490
bake just like your dad told you don't

455
00:15:30,929 --> 00:15:33,139
let the pots don't when you pull a plant

456
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:35,089
out of a pass

457
00:15:33,139 --> 00:15:37,069
don't don't sit it out the Sun for a

458
00:15:35,089 --> 00:15:38,899
couple hours before you planted you have

459
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:40,339
to consider the the fertile pot as

460
00:15:38,899 --> 00:15:42,110
something that's been you know out of

461
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:44,570
the pot if you will that's a really good

462
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:47,269
point uh yeah I don't always I don't

463
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:49,220
always think about that but yeah I did

464
00:15:47,269 --> 00:15:51,679
notice with my fabric pots I do have to

465
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:53,660
water more frequently than in plastic

466
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:55,189
containers yeah well I would give you

467
00:15:53,659 --> 00:15:56,629
the the pluses and minuses I mean

468
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:58,700
there's you know advantages and

469
00:15:56,629 --> 00:16:00,500
disadvantages to every system yeah so

470
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:02,450
another thing regarding these fertile

471
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:04,339
pots is you do have the environmental

472
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:05,870
impact of shipping them you know the

473
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:09,470
fossil fuel cost of getting them here

474
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:10,578
from France tree relatively speaking I

475
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:12,709
still think that that environmental

476
00:16:10,578 --> 00:16:15,319
impact is going to be less than that of

477
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:17,569
a fabric container or especially a

478
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:21,320
plastic container I mean right now at my

479
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:23,028
nursery I have these giant one in two

480
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:25,579
yard totes that are just full of old

481
00:16:23,028 --> 00:16:27,799
containers that I've people drop them

482
00:16:25,578 --> 00:16:29,809
off at our nursery all the time and so

483
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:32,359
we you know no one wants them because a

484
00:16:29,809 --> 00:16:34,669
lot of commercial operations won't reuse

485
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:37,579
containers because of the potential for

486
00:16:34,669 --> 00:16:40,219
pathogens and disease sure and the cost

487
00:16:37,578 --> 00:16:42,229
to and labor to sanitize these

488
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:45,980
containers is just not it's not worth it

489
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:47,870
so I'm excited to stop having to you

490
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:49,190
know take these containers in and store

491
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:51,110
them on my property and then potentially

492
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:52,579
also have to take them to the dump and

493
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:54,620
add more plastic back into our

494
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:56,000
environment so in that regard I think

495
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:57,889
they still have less of an environmental

496
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,750
impact even though they are coming all

497
00:16:57,889 --> 00:17:01,519
the way from France well I can give you

498
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:03,289
a couple of little points that I mean

499
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,730
well first of all the majority the

500
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:07,369
shipping is on water which is a

501
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:09,740
relatively low carbon impact in terms of

502
00:17:07,369 --> 00:17:11,869
you know pounds of carbon per mile if

503
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:14,000
you will compared to say trucking which

504
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:16,039
is very high but one of the neat things

505
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,470
about the way fertile produces these

506
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:20,119
pots is that they use hydroelectric

507
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:22,459
energy that's produced from the creek

508
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:25,729
from the stream that is is next to them

509
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:27,439
there's three generating stations so all

510
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:29,599
of the electricity that's used in the

511
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:32,390
process is you know completely renewable

512
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:36,139
the the forests that they harvest the

513
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:38,090
trees from are non GMO GMOs not

514
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:40,220
permitted in France period there's no

515
00:17:38,089 --> 00:17:41,389
clear cutting permitted they must plant

516
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:43,250
with you know at least I think it's five

517
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:44,509
or six species of trees I might be a

518
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:46,519
little off on the number zero but it's

519
00:17:44,509 --> 00:17:47,039
quite a few and they're they're not

520
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:50,430
allowed

521
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:51,779
to use heavy machinery in there so it's

522
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:53,850
it's really a very different way of

523
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:55,649
foresting than say in the United States

524
00:17:53,849 --> 00:17:57,089
where you have you know just massive

525
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:59,490
tracts of land that are clear-cut you

526
00:17:57,089 --> 00:18:01,379
won't see that at all in France they've

527
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:04,140
been actively managing this forest the

528
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:06,570
the wood is cut from for over 400 years

529
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:07,920
a long time ago they cut down everything

530
00:18:06,569 --> 00:18:09,929
they made a big mistake and then the

531
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,310
King of France to decree that you know

532
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:13,259
there's going to be no more of this and

533
00:18:11,309 --> 00:18:15,659
so that's why you don't see this kind of

534
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:17,430
clear cut and slash logging in Europe

535
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:20,250
that's great that's great to hear

536
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:22,470
so changing directions a little bit here

537
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:25,349
you mentioned that you can get some

538
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:26,640
mould on these containers yup over time

539
00:18:25,349 --> 00:18:29,579
can you talk a little bit about that

540
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:32,700
sure basically what the what we're

541
00:18:29,579 --> 00:18:35,429
talking about is sacrifice sacrifice are

542
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:37,830
an opportunistic fungus that will feed

543
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:40,320
on dead and decaying material the

544
00:18:37,829 --> 00:18:41,879
Fertile pot itself is sterile when it's

545
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:44,519
produced because the temperatures that

546
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:46,470
that the pot is basically baked it's

547
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:49,049
almost like making paper mache

548
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:50,640
where the the wood is ground up it's put

549
00:18:49,049 --> 00:18:52,859
into a slurry there's a screen or a

550
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,410
sieve that dips into that a vacuum is

551
00:18:52,859 --> 00:18:58,829
formed it draws the enough wood up onto

552
00:18:55,410 --> 00:19:00,810
the screen that screen goes into an oven

553
00:18:58,829 --> 00:19:02,849
for about 45 to 50 minutes

554
00:19:00,809 --> 00:19:04,679
where it's oh it's almost three hundred

555
00:19:02,849 --> 00:19:06,179
and something degrees I mean nothing can

556
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:09,120
live through that there are no pathogens

557
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:10,170
at all alive on the plants or on the

558
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:13,259
pots when they are delivered to you

559
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:15,210
however in your greenhouse you might

560
00:19:13,259 --> 00:19:17,190
have satellites well it's likely you

561
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:19,110
have sacrifice floating around it's a

562
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:22,080
natural part of the soil

563
00:19:19,109 --> 00:19:24,149
it actually makes healthy soil to have

564
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:26,039
sacrifice in there so if somebody says

565
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:27,269
well I'm getting mold on my pots and you

566
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:29,670
know your pots are causing a problem

567
00:19:27,269 --> 00:19:31,529
here it's not the pots that are the

568
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:33,180
problem it's really dirty greenhouses

569
00:19:31,529 --> 00:19:35,279
that are causing the problem people

570
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:36,840
don't like to hear that but usually the

571
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:38,579
the answer that I give to them I said do

572
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:40,500
you still have some in the box say well

573
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:42,000
yes I do we'll take some bring them home

574
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,559
put them on your shelf in the in the

575
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,450
kitchen and grow some there and tell me

576
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:47,579
if you get the same fungus and the

577
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:49,289
answer is almost every single time no I

578
00:19:47,579 --> 00:19:50,639
don't get the same fungus and it's a

579
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:53,490
matter of sanitation in the greenhouse

580
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,960
as far as as the separate fights now

581
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:56,400
several fights are not a bad thing

582
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,789
they're actually a good thing for soil

583
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,160
health

584
00:19:56,789 --> 00:20:00,359
however they are unsightly and for

585
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,920
people trying to grow a commercial

586
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:03,859
product

587
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:06,289
that can be a problem so it's it's the

588
00:20:03,859 --> 00:20:08,059
pot will support life because it is

589
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:09,799
biodegradable that's the definition of

590
00:20:08,059 --> 00:20:12,950
biodegradable it must be able to support

591
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:14,149
life and if you've got a set prophytes

592
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:16,370
loading around the greenhouse it's

593
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:18,230
possible that you can get mold or fungus

594
00:20:16,369 --> 00:20:19,819
growing on there and sanitation is the

595
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:21,110
key to solving that problem yeah I think

596
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:23,960
it's important for people to realize

597
00:20:21,109 --> 00:20:26,389
that not all microbes are bad and that's

598
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:27,860
no they're actually good I mean a lot of

599
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:29,720
are very good you know that's that's a

600
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:32,389
part of a natural healthy soil structure

601
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:34,279
is to have mold and fungus in there that

602
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:36,620
are creating a you know a vibrant

603
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:38,599
ecosystem yeah now when I first found

604
00:20:36,619 --> 00:20:41,539
out about this I was I was super excited

605
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:45,349
and I thought my natural progression

606
00:20:41,539 --> 00:20:47,899
would be a you know like a 2x2 inch cube

607
00:20:45,349 --> 00:20:49,789
or maybe starting in a four inch with

608
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:51,800
our veggie start and then going into

609
00:20:49,789 --> 00:20:54,139
like possibly a one gallon and then up

610
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:57,019
to a five gallon and then I we started

611
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:59,210
talking a little bit more and you made

612
00:20:57,019 --> 00:21:01,670
it clear to me that these pots only go

613
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:03,140
up to a certain size for a reason began

614
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:05,330
when I started thinking about it made

615
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:07,390
sense because they do biodegrade we

616
00:21:05,329 --> 00:21:10,189
can't have you know mother plants or

617
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:11,870
larger plants so what what's the largest

618
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:13,759
size that's really feasible with a

619
00:21:11,869 --> 00:21:15,619
fertile pot the largest size that's

620
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:17,629
that's really feasible with a photo pot

621
00:21:15,619 --> 00:21:18,739
is about a five inch round pot when you

622
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:20,030
would do actually make one that's a

623
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:22,220
little bit bigger than that but it'sit's

624
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:25,430
very difficult to manage because the

625
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:27,259
weight of the wet soil in there compared

626
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:29,509
to the volume of the pot or to the

627
00:21:27,259 --> 00:21:30,740
surface area the pot it's so heavy that

628
00:21:29,509 --> 00:21:32,089
it's very difficult to move them around

629
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:33,829
without you know breaking them quickly

630
00:21:32,089 --> 00:21:36,289
and and then becoming a problem so

631
00:21:33,829 --> 00:21:37,939
realistically about a five inch pot is

632
00:21:36,289 --> 00:21:39,589
about the largest size that you're going

633
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:41,539
to want to do one of the interesting

634
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:44,359
things one of our biggest markets is

635
00:21:41,539 --> 00:21:47,329
grape production for for wine grapes and

636
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:49,549
many many years ago everyone thought

637
00:21:47,329 --> 00:21:52,339
well we want a bigger pot for a better

638
00:21:49,549 --> 00:21:54,829
plant and we actually have a pot that is

639
00:21:52,339 --> 00:21:57,169
about four inches in squared about maybe

640
00:21:54,829 --> 00:21:58,939
seven or eight inches tall and that was

641
00:21:57,170 --> 00:22:01,039
the standard for a lot of great plants

642
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:02,660
for a long time and then somebody

643
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:04,039
decided well you know you've got to pot

644
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:06,380
this a little bit smaller than that it's

645
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:09,379
about maybe three inches wide and about

646
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:11,240
oh four inches tall they started using

647
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:12,710
them and they realized that they were

648
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:14,750
able to get a lot more plants in the

649
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:16,130
greenhouse and because of the type

650
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,299
rude structure remember we're setting up

651
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:19,940
the natural route structure with the

652
00:22:17,299 --> 00:22:21,829
enhanced air printing that's going on

653
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:23,000
they were actually able to get de

654
00:22:21,829 --> 00:22:25,039
fruiting and flowering than the same

655
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,529
amount of time that they were with a

656
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:29,960
larger pot going into the field before

657
00:22:27,529 --> 00:22:32,690
that so suddenly these guys all switched

658
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:34,759
to a well it's a seven by nine

659
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:36,380
centimeter pot that became the standard

660
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:38,329
for a long time and then somebody got

661
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:39,710
the great idea let me look at your pot

662
00:22:38,329 --> 00:22:42,399
that's even a little bit smaller than

663
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:44,930
that and right now the main standard for

664
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,210
the the grape industry is a five

665
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:50,299
centimeter by nine centimeter pot which

666
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:51,769
is about you know two inches or so by

667
00:22:50,299 --> 00:22:54,259
about three and a half inches deep and

668
00:22:51,769 --> 00:22:56,359
they've been able to put many more pots

669
00:22:54,259 --> 00:22:59,269
into the greenhouse and be able to get

670
00:22:56,359 --> 00:23:01,219
to a fruit production in the field in

671
00:22:59,269 --> 00:23:02,990
the same amount of time but increase

672
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:04,670
their output tremendously that's great

673
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:07,250
so a larger container is not necessarily

674
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:09,470
going to be more beneficial now that

675
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:12,200
though okay in some cases it can be a

676
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:13,700
problem because if you've got now when

677
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,860
you're when you're transplanting if

678
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:17,240
you're going into less than if you're

679
00:23:15,859 --> 00:23:18,859
transmitting into the soil let's say

680
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:21,049
you're going into less than desirable

681
00:23:18,859 --> 00:23:23,509
soil conditions if you have a very large

682
00:23:21,049 --> 00:23:25,970
pot and you you put that into the hole

683
00:23:23,509 --> 00:23:27,529
and the the you're going from a really

684
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:29,720
nice peat moss mix or you know what

685
00:23:27,529 --> 00:23:32,480
other substrate you're using the roots

686
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:33,980
tend to not want to explore into less

687
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,670
than desirable soil conditions out there

688
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:39,049
so this is why having the smaller pot

689
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:40,160
forces the roots out and especially if

690
00:23:39,049 --> 00:23:41,450
you've got the fertile pot where the

691
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:43,730
roots are on the outside of the pot and

692
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:46,610
they're in contact they generally tend

693
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:48,259
to explore into that surrounding soil a

694
00:23:46,609 --> 00:23:50,479
lot faster than something that's got a

695
00:23:48,259 --> 00:23:52,730
lot more soil that it can use up in a

696
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:55,069
really comfortable space so the smaller

697
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:57,559
pot doesn't take into account the

698
00:23:55,069 --> 00:23:59,329
fertility system involved or the

699
00:23:57,559 --> 00:24:01,789
fertigation going on so I would assume

700
00:23:59,329 --> 00:24:03,169
in the smaller container you're you're

701
00:24:01,789 --> 00:24:05,389
probably fertilizing a little more

702
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:07,970
frequently for these these grape growers

703
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:09,470
because there's less fertilizer in the

704
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:12,160
soil because you're using less media

705
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:15,920
well there's there's the same amount of

706
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:18,620
fertility needed per you know cubic inch

707
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:19,910
of plant material I don't think it

708
00:24:18,619 --> 00:24:23,509
necessarily you know increasing your

709
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:25,700
rates you're going to be maybe applying

710
00:24:23,509 --> 00:24:27,379
a little bit more frequently because you

711
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:28,400
have less soil that that holds the

712
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,990
moisture and if you

713
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,850
you're you know liquid irrigating our

714
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:33,769
liquid feeding you might be using a

715
00:24:31,849 --> 00:24:36,409
little more in terms of the amount of

716
00:24:33,769 --> 00:24:38,029
time the number of cycles is you doing

717
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:39,980
there but the the fertility should be

718
00:24:38,029 --> 00:24:41,539
about the same between a larger plant

719
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:42,860
and a smaller plant in terms of the

720
00:24:41,539 --> 00:24:45,109
amount of fertilizers you're going to

721
00:24:42,859 --> 00:24:47,899
need okay but you're able to reduce the

722
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:49,879
size of the container relative to reduce

723
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:51,740
the size of the container you increase

724
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:54,080
the output of your greenhouse per square

725
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:56,299
foot because remember the greenhouse has

726
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:57,889
an overhead cost there's you know it

727
00:24:56,299 --> 00:24:59,930
cost so many dollars per square foot to

728
00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:01,970
run that place whether you have you know

729
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:03,680
one plant in there or 10,000 plants in

730
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:05,660
there so when you can divide that

731
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:07,430
operating the overhead operating costs

732
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:09,230
across more plants you're going to be

733
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:11,000
more profitable sure and I think this is

734
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:12,079
even more of an issue with cannabis

735
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,660
because a lot of them are using

736
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:16,279
artificial lighting which costs even

737
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:18,500
more money from an electrical

738
00:25:16,279 --> 00:25:20,839
perspective and energy perspective so

739
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:23,210
having being able to create that that

740
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:25,549
canopy with you know less square footage

741
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:26,960
I think is a great option for sure

742
00:25:25,549 --> 00:25:29,059
now the question is going to be can you

743
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,769
get to fruiting and flowering with like

744
00:25:29,059 --> 00:25:32,480
whether the grapes is what I'm familiar

745
00:25:30,769 --> 00:25:34,220
with and you know I can't speak to

746
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,960
cannabis with with any degree of

747
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:38,210
expertise but it's going to be a

748
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:40,519
question of do you get to flowering in

749
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:43,910
the same amount of time where you can

750
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:46,160
actually harvest with more plants that's

751
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:47,570
that's really the question yeah and one

752
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:49,550
thing you mentioned too was going from

753
00:25:47,569 --> 00:25:51,799
different types of media where you have

754
00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:54,529
a really good potting soil inside your

755
00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:57,470
container and then that exterior soil is

756
00:25:54,529 --> 00:25:59,269
not of the same the same quality and the

757
00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:00,950
roots won't want to push out we do we do

758
00:25:59,269 --> 00:26:02,990
see that in a traditional landscape

759
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:05,269
because we're taking fruit trees for

760
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:06,680
example and that are grown in really

761
00:26:05,269 --> 00:26:08,210
good soil that we're then putting out

762
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:09,830
into a ground where we don't always know

763
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:12,559
the fertility or the quality of the

764
00:26:09,829 --> 00:26:14,240
right so that the homeowner has now for

765
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:16,099
cannabis most people are going from

766
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,380
potting soil to potting soil where

767
00:26:16,099 --> 00:26:21,079
there's not that difference so it's not

768
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:22,990
so much of an issue yeah but if in a

769
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:25,460
situation say you had an outdoor

770
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:27,170
greenhouse where the soil quality was

771
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:29,600
not quite the same as the potting soil

772
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:32,090
then I could see where this container

773
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:34,309
size might might come into play or what

774
00:26:32,089 --> 00:26:36,139
we like to do is take some good compost

775
00:26:34,309 --> 00:26:38,809
or a portion of that potting soil and

776
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:39,890
mix it in with the native soils around I

777
00:26:38,809 --> 00:26:41,548
guess in this case it would probably

778
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:43,919
around your container but

779
00:26:41,548 --> 00:26:45,749
generally we do it around in the hole we

780
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,639
dig that hole twice the size of our root

781
00:26:45,749 --> 00:26:50,220
ball and then mix that in so that the

782
00:26:47,638 --> 00:26:52,288
roots will want to reach out past that

783
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:53,489
original shape they were right right

784
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:55,019
this is why it's important to have the

785
00:26:53,489 --> 00:26:56,489
roots on the outside of the pot like you

786
00:26:55,019 --> 00:26:58,109
do with the fertile pot so they're

787
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:59,369
already in contact with that right away

788
00:26:58,109 --> 00:27:01,109
they don't want to just stay in this

789
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:02,699
nice little home that they've got right

790
00:27:01,109 --> 00:27:04,788
there you know one of the one of the

791
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:07,200
things that we're finding in terms of

792
00:27:04,788 --> 00:27:10,470
transplanting there is the the guys who

793
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:12,419
are doing sun-grown hemp production seem

794
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:14,190
to be experiencing some success with the

795
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:17,460
fertile pots because they're going into

796
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:19,619
you know the soil outside you're going

797
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:21,778
into a another larger pot with really

798
00:27:19,618 --> 00:27:23,849
nice compost in there might not make as

799
00:27:21,778 --> 00:27:25,739
much of a difference there yes so in

800
00:27:23,849 --> 00:27:27,748
general we're using this for to put it

801
00:27:25,739 --> 00:27:30,239
in terms that most growers are used to

802
00:27:27,749 --> 00:27:33,089
is we would use them for our seed trays

803
00:27:30,239 --> 00:27:35,460
for maybe a traditional four inch

804
00:27:33,089 --> 00:27:38,519
container and then up to about a one

805
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:40,710
gallon or number one sized container is

806
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:42,599
sort of the largest size fertile pot is

807
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:45,269
that correct yeah yeah we're really a

808
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:47,339
propagation company it's it's you know

809
00:27:45,269 --> 00:27:48,690
when the five inches are the largest or

810
00:27:47,339 --> 00:27:49,798
twelve centimeters the largest that we

811
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:51,720
could do right now that's that's

812
00:27:49,798 --> 00:27:53,398
realistically feasible we're not

813
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:55,649
somebody who's going to be providing you

814
00:27:53,398 --> 00:27:57,599
with three and five and 15 and 25 gallon

815
00:27:55,648 --> 00:27:59,278
containers after that it just it's not

816
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:00,959
possible with a biodegradable container

817
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:02,940
like that and we're really meant for

818
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,819
getting it started in the greenhouse

819
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:07,169
going from a seed or a cutting but

820
00:28:05,819 --> 00:28:09,538
that's another thing I kind of wanted to

821
00:28:07,169 --> 00:28:12,028
bring up is you know we our propagation

822
00:28:09,538 --> 00:28:13,769
and we can produce a tremendous root

823
00:28:12,028 --> 00:28:15,480
structure we can produce a natural root

824
00:28:13,769 --> 00:28:18,149
structure but it depends on what you

825
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:20,548
bring to the party if you are starting

826
00:28:18,148 --> 00:28:23,038
into a fertile pot with a seed or with a

827
00:28:20,548 --> 00:28:25,319
cutting or a clone or even a plug

828
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:27,419
something that's coming out of a really

829
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:30,358
good plug system that's been moved right

830
00:28:27,419 --> 00:28:31,859
on time or a nellie pot or some of these

831
00:28:30,358 --> 00:28:34,319
other you know forties and these these

832
00:28:31,858 --> 00:28:36,269
kind of plug systems it will perform

833
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:39,178
very well but if you bring to the party

834
00:28:36,269 --> 00:28:41,339
an overgrown plug that is wrapped up and

835
00:28:39,179 --> 00:28:44,009
in a containerized structure I can't

836
00:28:41,339 --> 00:28:45,298
undo that with the fertile pot so it's

837
00:28:44,009 --> 00:28:46,858
important that you start from the

838
00:28:45,298 --> 00:28:48,690
beginning and get your root structure

839
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:50,158
right from the very beginning as soon as

840
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:51,929
you compromise that restructure with any

841
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:53,278
kind of containerization there is no

842
00:28:51,929 --> 00:28:55,210
system that's going to be able to undo

843
00:28:53,278 --> 00:28:56,859
that so the whole idea here is just

844
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:58,000
minimizing transplant shock we're trying

845
00:28:56,859 --> 00:29:00,519
to keep the plant as happy as possible

846
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,339
so we're not adding on any delays in

847
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:05,500
terms of our overall plant cycle and you

848
00:29:03,339 --> 00:29:07,928
mentioned some of these other containers

849
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:10,619
or propagation methods can we touch on

850
00:29:07,929 --> 00:29:13,120
the differences between fertile pot and

851
00:29:10,619 --> 00:29:16,148
the pros and cons of like soil blocks

852
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:17,259
Oasis cubes peat pots rapid rooters some

853
00:29:16,148 --> 00:29:19,658
of these things that people are more

854
00:29:17,259 --> 00:29:21,339
familiar with well there's there's a lot

855
00:29:19,659 --> 00:29:23,020
of systems out there I mean it's a you

856
00:29:21,339 --> 00:29:24,308
know absolutely amazing the ingenuity

857
00:29:23,019 --> 00:29:26,710
that people have had over the years in

858
00:29:24,308 --> 00:29:29,740
trying to you know produce propagation

859
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:31,778
systems I'll which particularly one do

860
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:33,759
you want to tackle let's start with so

861
00:29:31,778 --> 00:29:35,440
let's just start with an easy one so no

862
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:37,329
blocks was one that I had never heard of

863
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:40,419
until recently one of my employees

864
00:29:37,329 --> 00:29:42,548
mentioned that on her tiny farm cheese's

865
00:29:40,419 --> 00:29:44,409
these things that make make little

866
00:29:42,548 --> 00:29:47,109
blocks of soil so there actually isn't a

867
00:29:44,409 --> 00:29:49,090
container around her plant

868
00:29:47,109 --> 00:29:51,038
I had an initial thought on that but

869
00:29:49,089 --> 00:29:52,928
I'll go and let you speak to it first

870
00:29:51,038 --> 00:29:54,759
it's kind of like if you were a kid and

871
00:29:52,929 --> 00:29:56,230
you had a little you're building a

872
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:59,019
sandcastle at the beach and you got a

873
00:29:56,230 --> 00:30:01,089
mold that's shaped like a brick and you

874
00:29:59,019 --> 00:30:02,379
pack the sand in there and then you pull

875
00:30:01,089 --> 00:30:04,629
it out that's essentially what you're

876
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:06,460
doing the problem with the soil block is

877
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:08,860
that you're compressing the soil you're

878
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:10,840
reducing the the air ratio in there and

879
00:30:08,859 --> 00:30:12,639
the availability of oxygen is really the

880
00:30:10,839 --> 00:30:14,199
number one factor in determining whether

881
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,788
or not roots are going to develop so

882
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:18,819
you've got to have a substrate that

883
00:30:15,788 --> 00:30:20,980
allows for good aeration in there and

884
00:30:18,819 --> 00:30:23,109
when you compress something you're

885
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:25,480
limiting those air spaces and making it

886
00:30:23,109 --> 00:30:27,369
harder for roots to develop yeah that

887
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:30,548
was my concern with compaction yeah you

888
00:30:27,369 --> 00:30:32,079
don't see that I mean I see that in a

889
00:30:30,548 --> 00:30:34,569
lot of small organic operations

890
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:36,819
especially in the Northeast but I have

891
00:30:34,569 --> 00:30:38,918
never ever seen that in any serious

892
00:30:36,819 --> 00:30:41,200
commercial operation I wanted to talk to

893
00:30:38,919 --> 00:30:43,330
you about peat pots because I have used

894
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,880
those in the past with clones and

895
00:30:43,329 --> 00:30:48,428
seedlings and I've seen them in you know

896
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:49,809
Home Depot for example what's the big

897
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:52,720
difference there between a fertile pot

898
00:30:49,808 --> 00:30:53,889
and a peat pot one of the ways you can

899
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,350
tell the difference between a fertile

900
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:58,299
pot and a peat pot is look at the bottom

901
00:30:56,349 --> 00:31:00,819
of the pot if there's a drain hole cut

902
00:30:58,298 --> 00:31:03,220
into it then it's a peat pot if there's

903
00:31:00,819 --> 00:31:06,099
no drain holes cut into it then it's a

904
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:07,690
fertile pot well the reason that the

905
00:31:06,099 --> 00:31:09,129
peat pots are using the drain holes cut

906
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:12,490
into them is because the wall of the

907
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:14,380
is not porous enough to allow the air

908
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:16,900
the roots and the water to pass easily

909
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:19,090
through the pot so they cut a drain hole

910
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:20,710
into it and of course you know by

911
00:31:19,089 --> 00:31:22,149
extension you can you can see that as

912
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:23,798
the roots reach the edge of that pot

913
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:24,640
they're not going to pass through

914
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:27,609
they're going to they're going to turn

915
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:29,230
inside now as the pot breaks down you

916
00:31:27,609 --> 00:31:30,759
will start to get roots passing through

917
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:32,679
the sidewall of the pot this is true

918
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:34,298
but you if you go into the the box

919
00:31:32,679 --> 00:31:35,559
stores and you look at some of the the

920
00:31:34,298 --> 00:31:37,690
vegetable plants that are offered in

921
00:31:35,558 --> 00:31:39,879
peat pots you'll see on the instructions

922
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:41,950
it says to tear the bottom of the pot

923
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:44,320
off before you plant it in the ground

924
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:45,850
and there's a simple reason for that

925
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:48,129
because they want this the roots to be

926
00:31:45,849 --> 00:31:50,168
in contact with the soil and the pot is

927
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:53,530
not going to break down on its own as

928
00:31:50,169 --> 00:31:55,630
easily in the ground so with the peat

929
00:31:53,529 --> 00:31:57,158
with a fertile pot we do not recommend

930
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:58,659
tearing the bottom the bottom of the pot

931
00:31:57,159 --> 00:32:00,159
off and matter of fact we don't

932
00:31:58,659 --> 00:32:02,140
recommend recommend doing anything

933
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:04,210
except putting it into the soil or the

934
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:08,169
next larger container okay and then what

935
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:09,880
about what about Oasis cubes or rapid

936
00:32:08,169 --> 00:32:11,679
rooters those are two really common ones

937
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:14,380
I see in the industry you know one is

938
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:17,140
sort of a synthetic or artificial medium

939
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:19,150
yeah and the other one uses it looks

940
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:20,919
like a rich rubber base so I sim glues

941
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:22,600
can you touch on those real quick

942
00:32:20,919 --> 00:32:25,179
well the Oasis has got some some

943
00:32:22,599 --> 00:32:27,908
advantages in that it's extremely

944
00:32:25,179 --> 00:32:31,659
consistent material you're going to have

945
00:32:27,909 --> 00:32:32,020
a really high media to air ratio in

946
00:32:31,659 --> 00:32:35,500
there

947
00:32:32,019 --> 00:32:38,109
but it's also completely devoid of any

948
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:41,079
organic matter so there is no cation

949
00:32:38,109 --> 00:32:42,699
exchange with Oasis when you are growing

950
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:44,500
with the wases it's a it's a very

951
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:46,720
technical product and you can grow a

952
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:47,919
good plant with that for sure but you

953
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,150
have to be very very careful about

954
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:49,538
making sure that your fertility is

955
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:52,659
dead-on

956
00:32:49,538 --> 00:32:53,919
and it's very very consistent so there's

957
00:32:52,659 --> 00:32:55,870
like I said there's some advantages

958
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:57,309
disadvantages to everything when you're

959
00:32:55,869 --> 00:32:58,839
using a fertile pod or when using any

960
00:32:57,308 --> 00:33:00,668
kind of organic media you've got you

961
00:32:58,839 --> 00:33:02,168
know good cation exchange you're going

962
00:33:00,669 --> 00:33:04,509
to have the ability for that soil to

963
00:33:02,169 --> 00:33:06,549
hold and release nutrients to the plant

964
00:33:04,509 --> 00:33:10,240
as needed so it's a little more

965
00:33:06,548 --> 00:33:12,369
forgiving than then foam products the

966
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,558
rubber glue is another interesting where

967
00:33:12,369 --> 00:33:16,389
the glue plugs or the rubber dirt is

968
00:33:14,558 --> 00:33:20,019
another interesting product it's its

969
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:22,480
media that's mixed with glue and then

970
00:33:20,019 --> 00:33:23,058
poured into trays you'll see it in

971
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,429
things like

972
00:33:23,058 --> 00:33:26,749
for Mom and I guess rapid Rooter I'm not

973
00:33:25,429 --> 00:33:28,580
exactly familiar with that one but if

974
00:33:26,749 --> 00:33:30,409
it's a it's a glue plug it's the same

975
00:33:28,579 --> 00:33:32,418
kind of thing and the benefit to those

976
00:33:30,409 --> 00:33:34,009
is that as the roots develop they don't

977
00:33:32,419 --> 00:33:35,299
reach the edge of the the cell that

978
00:33:34,009 --> 00:33:37,278
they're in yet you can still pull the

979
00:33:35,298 --> 00:33:39,440
whole thing and the plug will stay

980
00:33:37,278 --> 00:33:40,970
together because of the the glue that's

981
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,788
in there I'm not sure if they're

982
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:45,379
available in organic or not but the idea

983
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:46,999
with the fertile pot is that everything

984
00:33:45,378 --> 00:33:49,248
in there's organic there is no glues

985
00:33:46,999 --> 00:33:51,110
there's no binders that's in there okay

986
00:33:49,249 --> 00:33:54,710
and any comments on rock wool cubes

987
00:33:51,109 --> 00:33:56,808
ah rockwool cubes um again it's it's a

988
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:58,278
it's a mineral I do not believe it's

989
00:33:56,808 --> 00:34:00,740
approved for use in organics at the

990
00:33:58,278 --> 00:34:02,868
moment although I that seems to be

991
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:04,909
changing all the time so you know check

992
00:34:02,868 --> 00:34:07,638
back with uh with armory on that

993
00:34:04,909 --> 00:34:09,800
relatively expensive compared to fertile

994
00:34:07,638 --> 00:34:11,418
pot with a media in there and then

995
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:13,399
impossible to get rid of at the end of

996
00:34:11,418 --> 00:34:15,108
the story because it doesn't doesn't

997
00:34:13,398 --> 00:34:17,358
break down and you're gonna have to

998
00:34:15,108 --> 00:34:18,949
throw it away in a landfill and then the

999
00:34:17,358 --> 00:34:20,480
last one I had on my list was arrow

1000
00:34:18,949 --> 00:34:23,809
cloners I see a lot of people using

1001
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:25,969
those and then going into soil and for

1002
00:34:23,809 --> 00:34:28,190
me that challenge was always trying to

1003
00:34:25,969 --> 00:34:29,989
be delicate to the roots and get them

1004
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:32,148
planted correctly without damaging the

1005
00:34:29,989 --> 00:34:33,648
plant and I always seem to get

1006
00:34:32,148 --> 00:34:35,690
transplant Chalk when you when going

1007
00:34:33,648 --> 00:34:38,088
from a narrow corner in this soil I'm

1008
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:39,470
sorry I can't speak to that one I didn't

1009
00:34:38,088 --> 00:34:42,469
do my homework on what an arrow cloner

1010
00:34:39,469 --> 00:34:44,898
was it's sort of a misting system so the

1011
00:34:42,469 --> 00:34:46,908
the okay roots are just sitting in air

1012
00:34:44,898 --> 00:34:50,750
and then being continually misted in

1013
00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:53,568
underneath the level of the that you can

1014
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:55,878
picture like up right a giant Rubbermaid

1015
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:58,550
tote sort of thing with holes in the top

1016
00:34:55,878 --> 00:35:00,618
and then there's a aeroponic or misting

1017
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:02,210
system underneath that the roots are

1018
00:35:00,619 --> 00:35:03,980
exposed to so you can put a nutrient

1019
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:06,530
solution or or some sort of cloning

1020
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:07,909
solution to that sure so that's yeah

1021
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:09,680
that's that's going to be there's going

1022
00:35:07,909 --> 00:35:11,838
to be water roots that's that's real

1023
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:13,190
lying you know exclusively on on taking

1024
00:35:11,838 --> 00:35:15,349
up the nutrients from the moisture there

1025
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:17,179
that's in the air making that transition

1026
00:35:15,349 --> 00:35:18,710
to terrestrial roots is is difficult

1027
00:35:17,179 --> 00:35:20,088
sometimes so that's why you're getting

1028
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:22,280
the transplant shock there if you're

1029
00:35:20,088 --> 00:35:23,809
trying to go into a soil from there you

1030
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:26,359
can probably continue to grow and go

1031
00:35:23,809 --> 00:35:28,068
into you know hydroponic systems and it

1032
00:35:26,358 --> 00:35:29,989
would probably do well but the

1033
00:35:28,068 --> 00:35:31,759
transition between you know water roots

1034
00:35:29,989 --> 00:35:33,709
to terrestrial roots is a difficult one

1035
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,730
it's a little easier to go the other way

1036
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:37,470
from terrestrial too to water

1037
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:39,480
roots and that's why you'll see like

1038
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:41,250
with the total pot a lot of people will

1039
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:43,320
start with a very very small plug like a

1040
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:45,449
72 so that's a you know one of our

1041
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:48,690
strips they'll start them they'll grow

1042
00:35:45,449 --> 00:35:49,529
them you know lettuce and other kind of

1043
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:51,059
herbs that they're growing

1044
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:53,550
hydroponically and they'll take those

1045
00:35:51,059 --> 00:35:56,159
and they'll transplant those plugs into

1046
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:58,080
floating rafts and the roots will then

1047
00:35:56,159 --> 00:36:00,659
continue to grow down through and into

1048
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:02,340
the the nutrient solution tank

1049
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:04,139
underneath and the water roots will

1050
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:05,400
develop there but it's a little more

1051
00:36:04,139 --> 00:36:07,259
difficult to go the other way around

1052
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:09,750
sure and what sort of media are people

1053
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:11,760
using typically in your containers or

1054
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:13,769
does it vary across the board it's all

1055
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:15,570
across the board depending upon what

1056
00:36:13,769 --> 00:36:17,670
they personally think is the the best

1057
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:19,590
one for their crops I mean you know the

1058
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:22,470
majority people are using a soilless

1059
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:24,690
peat light based mixes a lot of choir is

1060
00:36:22,469 --> 00:36:27,149
now being incorporated people are doing

1061
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:29,579
you know mushroom compost there's all

1062
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:31,410
sorts of different formulas that are out

1063
00:36:29,579 --> 00:36:33,690
there but you can put whatever formula

1064
00:36:31,409 --> 00:36:34,920
you want into the pot it doesn't you

1065
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:37,608
know you don't you're not restricted to

1066
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:40,380
to one one sort of substrate or another

1067
00:36:37,608 --> 00:36:43,500
now I love encouraging people on this

1068
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:46,829
podcast to look outside of the cannabis

1069
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:48,989
industry for you know products nutrients

1070
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:50,608
information in general and research and

1071
00:36:48,989 --> 00:36:52,319
so can you tell me a little more about

1072
00:36:50,608 --> 00:36:54,659
some of the applications that you're

1073
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,950
seeing with these containers like you

1074
00:36:54,659 --> 00:37:00,480
said they've been around for a long time

1075
00:36:55,949 --> 00:37:02,039
now with the grape industry oh yeah well

1076
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,539
the grape industry has been you know one

1077
00:37:02,039 --> 00:37:06,269
of our biggest customers for a long time

1078
00:37:03,539 --> 00:37:08,789
we do just massive massive numbers in

1079
00:37:06,269 --> 00:37:11,280
Europe we do very large numbers in

1080
00:37:08,789 --> 00:37:12,690
California some in New York here but

1081
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,960
it's it's the grape industry has been a

1082
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:18,329
you know a reliable customer for us for

1083
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:20,030
a long time one of the other industries

1084
00:37:18,329 --> 00:37:22,829
that we do very very well with is

1085
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:25,470
breeders people who are experimenting

1086
00:37:22,829 --> 00:37:26,969
and trying to grow you know the perfect

1087
00:37:25,469 --> 00:37:28,980
crop and they're their seed companies

1088
00:37:26,969 --> 00:37:30,569
and so what they'll do is they'll you

1089
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:33,570
know maybe they might be doing GMO stuff

1090
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:35,580
but they will be they'll buy a million

1091
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:37,920
pots they'll plant up and they'll grow a

1092
00:37:35,579 --> 00:37:40,199
million different seedlings and then

1093
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,369
they select out of that 50 that they're

1094
00:37:40,199 --> 00:37:44,009
going to carry on from there

1095
00:37:41,369 --> 00:37:45,450
the remaining leftovers they want to get

1096
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:47,640
rid of and they don't want anybody to

1097
00:37:45,449 --> 00:37:49,649
have that genetic information so they

1098
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:51,480
compost it in the composting process

1099
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:53,849
the heat for the composting process

1100
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:55,349
destroys all the genetic information so

1101
00:37:53,849 --> 00:37:57,420
there's nothing left over and they don't

1102
00:37:55,349 --> 00:37:59,250
have to remove and clean up a million

1103
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:00,869
pots at the end of the story they just

1104
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:02,940
put them in the compost pile and turn

1105
00:38:00,869 --> 00:38:05,789
them into wind rows from there but the

1106
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:07,289
majority of our customers are normal you

1107
00:38:05,789 --> 00:38:09,420
know nurseries and greenhouses that are

1108
00:38:07,289 --> 00:38:10,440
propagating to grow on for something

1109
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:12,630
that's going to be a finished product

1110
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:14,278
later that's great I you know we can

1111
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:19,048
probably only talk about containers for

1112
00:38:14,278 --> 00:38:19,858
so long as a topic yes but I will if I

1113
00:38:19,048 --> 00:38:21,568
could go on forever

1114
00:38:19,858 --> 00:38:24,420
that's impressive I mean I can

1115
00:38:21,568 --> 00:38:26,579
appreciate that I will say that I was

1116
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:29,010
pleasantly surprised with the pricing

1117
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:32,278
associated with these containers and I'm

1118
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:36,630
positive that between the reduction in

1119
00:38:32,278 --> 00:38:39,000
transplant shock and the ability to you

1120
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:41,490
know have a larger window to transplant

1121
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:44,099
in the labor savings of not having to

1122
00:38:41,489 --> 00:38:46,038
remove the plant and Transplant it and

1123
00:38:44,099 --> 00:38:47,970
more traditional method is going to

1124
00:38:46,039 --> 00:38:50,099
Morgan more than pay for themselves

1125
00:38:47,969 --> 00:38:52,078
regardless of your opinions on the

1126
00:38:50,099 --> 00:38:55,079
ecological and environmental impact of

1127
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:56,910
you know traditional containers so I'm

1128
00:38:55,079 --> 00:39:00,390
really excited to incorporate these into

1129
00:38:56,909 --> 00:39:01,500
our processes in our nursery and start

1130
00:39:00,389 --> 00:39:03,150
working with more of these larger

1131
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:06,659
cultivation facilities or even you know

1132
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:09,000
smaller you know medical or or home

1133
00:39:06,659 --> 00:39:11,009
growths that want to switch over it's

1134
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,230
it's very very affordable that you know

1135
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:15,539
we're talking pennies on a lot of these

1136
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:17,039
pots so it's not yeah yeah I mean our

1137
00:39:15,539 --> 00:39:20,490
customers you know some of them are

1138
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:22,920
really environmentally conscious and you

1139
00:39:20,489 --> 00:39:24,118
know we check all the boxes they're you

1140
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,470
know it's a it's a it's a terrific

1141
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:27,720
product from an environmental standpoint

1142
00:39:25,469 --> 00:39:30,500
of view but the majority of our

1143
00:39:27,719 --> 00:39:32,250
commercial customers are not necessarily

1144
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:34,588
environmentally conscious they're

1145
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:36,778
conscious about pennies and so that's

1146
00:39:34,588 --> 00:39:38,639
that's where we also shine there yeah I

1147
00:39:36,778 --> 00:39:41,548
mean I'm a huge proponent of organics

1148
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:43,949
but I try not to push that too hard for

1149
00:39:41,548 --> 00:39:47,670
people because it can be off-putting so

1150
00:39:43,949 --> 00:39:49,469
I love products or methods that just

1151
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:52,409
happen to be organic but they make sense

1152
00:39:49,469 --> 00:39:53,639
economically to where even if you didn't

1153
00:39:52,409 --> 00:39:55,558
care about the environment or your

1154
00:39:53,639 --> 00:39:56,969
ecological impact you're still going to

1155
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:58,200
want to use this product or you're still

1156
00:39:56,969 --> 00:40:00,328
going to want to use this methodology

1157
00:39:58,199 --> 00:40:01,469
because it's right it's going to save

1158
00:40:00,329 --> 00:40:04,859
you money and time

1159
00:40:01,469 --> 00:40:07,049
and grow a better plant exactly one

1160
00:40:04,858 --> 00:40:08,639
other thing I wanted to say was a lot of

1161
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:10,769
people you know this is when people are

1162
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:13,170
asking me about how long does it take to

1163
00:40:10,769 --> 00:40:14,639
break down in the soil well this is a

1164
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:17,039
question that I get a lot of times and

1165
00:40:14,639 --> 00:40:19,559
my smart aleck answer is it doesn't

1166
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:22,199
matter because the pot is porous and

1167
00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:24,059
it's biodegradable it's not stopping air

1168
00:40:22,199 --> 00:40:26,429
routes or water from moving back and

1169
00:40:24,059 --> 00:40:28,318
forth over that barrier the longer

1170
00:40:26,429 --> 00:40:30,480
answer is it really depends on the

1171
00:40:28,318 --> 00:40:33,300
microbial action and where you are

1172
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,440
located if you're in you know Antarctica

1173
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:36,300
it's going to probably take a long time

1174
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:39,780
to break down it's like a book you keep

1175
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:41,130
it dry it'll last forever if you if its

1176
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:44,069
moist and wet it's going to break down

1177
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:46,140
faster so like I said the smart aleck

1178
00:40:44,068 --> 00:40:47,818
answer is it doesn't matter because the

1179
00:40:46,139 --> 00:40:50,098
plant is just there it's as if the pot

1180
00:40:47,818 --> 00:40:52,289
never existed realistically for most

1181
00:40:50,099 --> 00:40:53,760
people in North America about a year or

1182
00:40:52,289 --> 00:40:55,588
so you won't be able to find any

1183
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:58,859
evidence of the spot so that does bring

1184
00:40:55,588 --> 00:41:01,799
up a storage thing that you and I talked

1185
00:40:58,858 --> 00:41:04,049
about off air was that you do need to

1186
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:05,849
store these containers in a dry location

1187
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:07,289
you know that so they're not getting in

1188
00:41:05,849 --> 00:41:08,970
contact with moisture which can cause

1189
00:41:07,289 --> 00:41:12,269
the microbes to break them down faster

1190
00:41:08,969 --> 00:41:13,980
mice and rats may potentially chew on

1191
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:15,750
them if you had them say just sitting

1192
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:18,719
outside in your greenhouse yes

1193
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:20,369
in my barn here I have you know many

1194
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:23,029
many boxes of fertile pots that are four

1195
00:41:20,369 --> 00:41:25,588
samples some of them are many years old

1196
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:27,420
most of them sending out enough samples

1197
00:41:25,588 --> 00:41:28,949
that they're they're turning over but

1198
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:30,690
it's it like I said it's like a book if

1199
00:41:28,949 --> 00:41:33,059
you keep it dry like it is in the

1200
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:34,769
library it'll stay for hundreds of years

1201
00:41:33,059 --> 00:41:36,358
as soon as you let them get wet they'll

1202
00:41:34,769 --> 00:41:38,608
break down but we did have a problem

1203
00:41:36,358 --> 00:41:40,559
when we first moved here and put them

1204
00:41:38,608 --> 00:41:42,449
with the pots of the barn that the mice

1205
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:43,739
were eating them and the problem I'm

1206
00:41:42,449 --> 00:41:45,568
willing to share fertile pots with the

1207
00:41:43,739 --> 00:41:47,699
mice that's not a problem however they

1208
00:41:45,568 --> 00:41:49,289
only want to eat right up the stack and

1209
00:41:47,699 --> 00:41:52,259
they take one little Halfmoon out of the

1210
00:41:49,289 --> 00:41:54,929
top of every pot as it goes up so we got

1211
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:57,420
cats and that solved our problem that's

1212
00:41:54,929 --> 00:42:00,000
great now I want to change like switch

1213
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:03,180
gears a little bit because one of the

1214
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,858
things besides this product is you have

1215
00:42:03,179 --> 00:42:06,509
another product that's more specific for

1216
00:42:04,858 --> 00:42:08,429
gardeners and not so much cannabis but I

1217
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:10,020
do field a lot of our a lot of people

1218
00:42:08,429 --> 00:42:12,480
are growing cannabis are also interested

1219
00:42:10,019 --> 00:42:14,690
in growing their own vegetables and for

1220
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:17,000
me as a vegetable gardener

1221
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:18,829
I was really excited and I can't wait to

1222
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,869
try this out I've been reading about it

1223
00:42:18,829 --> 00:42:22,700
online and I know I have a sample coming

1224
00:42:20,869 --> 00:42:25,039
in the mail today I can't wait to check

1225
00:42:22,699 --> 00:42:26,118
it out now this product is for dealing

1226
00:42:25,039 --> 00:42:28,940
with slugs

1227
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:32,690
yes it's called slug gone bull pellets

1228
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:34,880
it's very cool it comes out of the UK

1229
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:36,500
and it's been on that while it's been

1230
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:39,680
around for quite a while now but

1231
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:41,329
realistically as as slug on wool pellets

1232
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:44,629
it's been on the market for about 10

1233
00:42:41,329 --> 00:42:47,900
years now and what it is it's pelletized

1234
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:51,289
waste wool that you put around a plant

1235
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:53,780
and when it swells up and it it felts

1236
00:42:51,289 --> 00:42:55,880
together it forms a barrier that slugs

1237
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:58,099
and snails don't want to cross over and

1238
00:42:55,880 --> 00:43:00,920
the neat thing about it is that it's a

1239
00:42:58,099 --> 00:43:02,690
season-long barrier because it takes so

1240
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:05,200
long for it to break down that'll stay

1241
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:07,519
efficacious for eight to fourteen months

1242
00:43:05,199 --> 00:43:10,129
the way that the way that this works is

1243
00:43:07,519 --> 00:43:11,838
you have a sheep and you when you shear

1244
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:13,940
the sheep you get the raw fleece which

1245
00:43:11,838 --> 00:43:16,519
has all of the stuff that has the good

1246
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:18,500
fibers in the in the the the lanlan but

1247
00:43:16,519 --> 00:43:20,900
it also has a lot of sweat and poo and

1248
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:22,760
dirt and other things like that and so

1249
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:24,619
when you take it to a scouring facility

1250
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:26,720
they take all of the good fibers in the

1251
00:43:24,619 --> 00:43:29,240
lanlan out and then what's left over is

1252
00:43:26,719 --> 00:43:31,608
called shaadi which is basically what it

1253
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:33,588
sounds like and it was a waste product

1254
00:43:31,608 --> 00:43:34,969
and so in order to get rid of it what

1255
00:43:33,588 --> 00:43:37,190
they would do is they would throw it on

1256
00:43:34,969 --> 00:43:38,299
to the fields next to these scouring

1257
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:40,700
facilities where they were growing

1258
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:42,470
rhubarb just to dispose of it they would

1259
00:43:40,699 --> 00:43:44,568
turn it in and they began to notice that

1260
00:43:42,469 --> 00:43:47,029
in these fields they were not getting

1261
00:43:44,568 --> 00:43:48,349
any Sluggers nail damage where in the

1262
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:51,170
fields where they were not turning the

1263
00:43:48,349 --> 00:43:52,849
slug the slug gun or the shotty into

1264
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:54,818
they were getting some so they began to

1265
00:43:52,849 --> 00:43:57,380
figure out what's going on here is that

1266
00:43:54,818 --> 00:43:59,329
slugs and snails have a mucous foot that

1267
00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:02,329
is easily irritated by anything that's

1268
00:43:59,329 --> 00:44:03,980
scratchy wool has little the fibers of

1269
00:44:02,329 --> 00:44:06,289
wool have little hooks and barbs in it

1270
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:08,869
that allow it to felt together to form a

1271
00:44:06,289 --> 00:44:11,869
fabric it's also makes its Scratchy and

1272
00:44:08,869 --> 00:44:13,818
so as the slugger snail tries to crawl

1273
00:44:11,869 --> 00:44:15,829
over this this wool product here

1274
00:44:13,818 --> 00:44:17,690
they find it irritating to their their

1275
00:44:15,829 --> 00:44:19,519
their mucous foot and they choose to go

1276
00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:21,530
somewhere else it doesn't kill them it's

1277
00:44:19,519 --> 00:44:23,329
not a pesticide it's not a poison it's a

1278
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:25,700
barrier that prevents them from reaching

1279
00:44:23,329 --> 00:44:28,019
the plant that you want to protect it

1280
00:44:25,699 --> 00:44:30,689
also acts as a

1281
00:44:28,019 --> 00:44:31,769
Wiccans acting as a as a wick that's

1282
00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:33,360
pulling the moisture out of this lugs

1283
00:44:31,769 --> 00:44:34,469
foot they don't like that either they

1284
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:36,510
don't like to be scratched and they

1285
00:44:34,469 --> 00:44:38,250
don't like to be dry but there's some of

1286
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:39,660
there's other benefits to it besides the

1287
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:41,670
fact that it's going to keep a plant

1288
00:44:39,659 --> 00:44:43,589
protected for eight to fourteen months

1289
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:45,750
from slugs and snails it's also a

1290
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:47,730
moisture mulch because as you put this

1291
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:48,960
down if the pilots swell up to about

1292
00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:51,119
three times their size they lock

1293
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:52,949
together they form this mat that the

1294
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:54,659
water can penetrate through rain will

1295
00:44:52,949 --> 00:44:56,129
penetrate down through but it doesn't

1296
00:44:54,659 --> 00:44:57,809
evaporate out from underneath so it

1297
00:44:56,130 --> 00:45:00,119
keeps the soil a little moisture around

1298
00:44:57,809 --> 00:45:01,529
the plant there when the does rain or

1299
00:45:00,119 --> 00:45:02,730
when you have you know high winds or

1300
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:05,250
whatever it's not going to blow away

1301
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:07,199
it's a it acts very much the same way

1302
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:08,909
diatomaceous earth does in terms of

1303
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:11,489
forming a barrier but it doesn't wash

1304
00:45:08,909 --> 00:45:13,019
away it doesn't it doesn't blow away you

1305
00:45:11,489 --> 00:45:15,329
don't need to reapply after every single

1306
00:45:13,019 --> 00:45:17,670
rain like you do with a lot of the iron

1307
00:45:15,329 --> 00:45:19,829
sulfate products it's also a weed

1308
00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:22,019
barrier I'm gonna be like that you know

1309
00:45:19,829 --> 00:45:23,759
the Ginsu knife here got here for a

1310
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:25,889
second but the wait there's more

1311
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:29,100
it's a weed barrier because it sets up

1312
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:30,569
this mat that the seeds can't can't come

1313
00:45:29,099 --> 00:45:32,339
up through the weeds don't want to come

1314
00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:34,050
up through and seeds that land on top of

1315
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:35,640
it because remember it's wicking the

1316
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:37,980
moisture away from the surface the

1317
00:45:35,639 --> 00:45:39,359
surface is very dry so seeds that land

1318
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:41,099
on top are less likely to be able to

1319
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:42,660
volunteer because there's not a lot of

1320
00:45:41,099 --> 00:45:45,449
available moisture on the surface of

1321
00:45:42,659 --> 00:45:48,869
this plant it's also a but wait there's

1322
00:45:45,449 --> 00:45:51,059
more there's also it's a thermal barrier

1323
00:45:48,869 --> 00:45:53,190
because wool has thermal properties so

1324
00:45:51,059 --> 00:45:55,349
during the summer it will keep the soil

1325
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:56,970
a little cooler around that plant it'll

1326
00:45:55,349 --> 00:45:58,500
also keep the soil a little warmer on

1327
00:45:56,969 --> 00:46:00,750
the shoulder seasons underneath so you

1328
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:02,760
can extend your growing season to some

1329
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:04,920
extent and at the end of the story

1330
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:06,360
basically it's organic matter that's

1331
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:08,039
just biodegrading and adding organic

1332
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:10,050
matter to your soil to increase the

1333
00:46:08,039 --> 00:46:14,639
health of your soil so are we getting

1334
00:46:10,050 --> 00:46:16,650
any nutrition or nutrients out of this

1335
00:46:14,639 --> 00:46:22,170
well this is where I get into a little

1336
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:24,900
bit of a pickle here in the the label in

1337
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:29,250
the UK there the label says contains

1338
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:32,010
slow-release nutrients or because it is

1339
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:34,980
organic matter so there is technically

1340
00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:38,430
some fertility to it however in the

1341
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:40,900
United States if you claim any kind of

1342
00:46:38,429 --> 00:46:43,049
fertility you are a fertilizer and

1343
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:46,000
you have to get DEP registration in

1344
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:48,100
every single state that you want to sell

1345
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,110
your product in and this was just not

1346
00:46:48,099 --> 00:46:52,150
feasible for us so the easier thing in

1347
00:46:50,110 --> 00:46:54,400
the US label it does not say anything

1348
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:55,690
about nutrition on there because

1349
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:58,059
nobody's going to buy this as a

1350
00:46:55,690 --> 00:47:00,700
fertilizer it's just not not really

1351
00:46:58,059 --> 00:47:02,440
effective as a fertilizer so the easier

1352
00:47:00,699 --> 00:47:03,669
thing was to say for the US we're not

1353
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:06,909
going to make any claims whatsoever

1354
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:08,559
about fertility at least in writing okay

1355
00:47:06,909 --> 00:47:10,779
but we can apply fertilizer over the top

1356
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:12,880
of it that would soluble eyes in water

1357
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:15,100
down through it you can apply fertilizer

1358
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:17,079
over top of it that will soluble and

1359
00:47:15,099 --> 00:47:19,599
we'll go through correct however you're

1360
00:47:17,079 --> 00:47:22,090
you're if you're using slow-release

1361
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:23,650
materials it might be a looked as a bit

1362
00:47:22,090 --> 00:47:24,970
of a barrier there you're definitely

1363
00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:27,910
going to have to have enough water to

1364
00:47:24,969 --> 00:47:30,369
flush it down through there okay and one

1365
00:47:27,909 --> 00:47:32,679
thing I wanted to talk about was prior

1366
00:47:30,369 --> 00:47:34,599
to learning about this product there

1367
00:47:32,679 --> 00:47:35,829
were sort of four options that I had for

1368
00:47:34,599 --> 00:47:38,319
organic gardeners that we're dealing

1369
00:47:35,829 --> 00:47:40,269
with slugs and the first one was Sluggo

1370
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:43,960
which I believe is iron phosphate it's

1371
00:47:40,269 --> 00:47:46,690
made by a large corporation I can't

1372
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:49,420
remember if it's Dow or Monsanto wasn't

1373
00:47:46,690 --> 00:47:51,670
one of those large egg companies which I

1374
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:52,389
try not to support when I can when I can

1375
00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:55,000
help it

1376
00:47:52,389 --> 00:47:56,829
but they that's where I that's what I

1377
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:59,260
was using and I didn't love the idea of

1378
00:47:56,829 --> 00:48:01,389
adding a you know an iron bit iron

1379
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:03,160
phosphate based product to my soils

1380
00:48:01,389 --> 00:48:05,379
consistently over time but it did it

1381
00:48:03,159 --> 00:48:06,719
does help control slugs in addition to

1382
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:09,340
that the next option would have been

1383
00:48:06,719 --> 00:48:11,199
like beer traps or things like that you

1384
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:14,920
know they're messy there are a lot of

1385
00:48:11,199 --> 00:48:16,599
work to set up and maintain plus I would

1386
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:19,030
rather drink the beer then give it to my

1387
00:48:16,599 --> 00:48:20,409
slugs sure the other option was going

1388
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:22,510
out there at night with your clippers

1389
00:48:20,409 --> 00:48:23,619
and just manually chopping them up as

1390
00:48:22,510 --> 00:48:25,090
you see them you're not going to get

1391
00:48:23,619 --> 00:48:27,789
every one but you can help keep them

1392
00:48:25,090 --> 00:48:29,950
under control that way and then the last

1393
00:48:27,789 --> 00:48:31,630
option was another barrier option which

1394
00:48:29,949 --> 00:48:33,879
is copper tape yeah but one thing you

1395
00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:36,970
talked about was not all slugs that we

1396
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:39,460
see are actually above-ground right the

1397
00:48:36,969 --> 00:48:43,149
the slug skin slugs do go underground oh

1398
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:45,670
this is one of the reasons that the slug

1399
00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:48,130
on wall pellets cannot be used you can't

1400
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:49,659
just take a barrier and put it all the

1401
00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:51,849
way around your garden you know ten feet

1402
00:48:49,659 --> 00:48:53,889
by ten feet let's say because the slugs

1403
00:48:51,849 --> 00:48:54,798
will go under it so what you need to do

1404
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:56,900
with with the slug

1405
00:48:54,798 --> 00:48:59,358
you need to put a four inch wide barrier

1406
00:48:56,900 --> 00:49:00,410
around the base of each plant so that as

1407
00:48:59,358 --> 00:49:02,719
they try to come up they're going to

1408
00:49:00,409 --> 00:49:04,909
encounter that the slug gun in there Wow

1409
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:07,249
it's again it's a barrier product that

1410
00:49:04,909 --> 00:49:09,618
can't be used on a per square foot basis

1411
00:49:07,248 --> 00:49:10,968
but I want to touch briefly on what

1412
00:49:09,619 --> 00:49:12,199
you're talking about with you know all

1413
00:49:10,969 --> 00:49:15,079
these other methods are basically

1414
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:17,479
killing the slugs and slugs you know

1415
00:49:15,079 --> 00:49:21,380
love of our Hatem they are part of the

1416
00:49:17,478 --> 00:49:23,118
ecosystem and when you remove any link

1417
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:24,709
in the chain and ecosystem you're

1418
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:29,088
creating a less than desirable situation

1419
00:49:24,708 --> 00:49:32,358
birds eat them lizards and frogs eat

1420
00:49:29,088 --> 00:49:34,458
them they do eat depending on the slugs

1421
00:49:32,358 --> 00:49:36,528
they do eat some of your pests out there

1422
00:49:34,458 --> 00:49:39,889
but it's something that what we choose

1423
00:49:36,528 --> 00:49:42,498
to do is say let's decide the plants you

1424
00:49:39,889 --> 00:49:44,420
can't have and you can go somewhere else

1425
00:49:42,498 --> 00:49:45,919
and be part of the ecosystem but just

1426
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:47,749
don't eat this plant here please I

1427
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:49,849
really like that little way of looking

1428
00:49:47,748 --> 00:49:52,159
at it slugs are a big issue here in

1429
00:49:49,849 --> 00:49:54,410
Washington state up with the weather

1430
00:49:52,159 --> 00:49:55,548
that we have or we have a ton of slugs

1431
00:49:54,409 --> 00:49:58,308
and there's nothing more frustrating

1432
00:49:55,548 --> 00:49:59,778
than growing a spinach plant and putting

1433
00:49:58,309 --> 00:50:01,999
all this time into it only to come out

1434
00:49:59,778 --> 00:50:04,068
the next day and have it just be munched

1435
00:50:01,998 --> 00:50:05,778
well snow it's no coincidence that the

1436
00:50:04,068 --> 00:50:07,998
weather in the UK is similar to the

1437
00:50:05,778 --> 00:50:11,449
weather in you know Northwest Washington

1438
00:50:07,998 --> 00:50:14,088
so one other thing about this slug gun

1439
00:50:11,449 --> 00:50:16,818
is that we didn't touch on yet is it

1440
00:50:14,088 --> 00:50:18,199
does have an odor so remember I was

1441
00:50:16,818 --> 00:50:20,058
saying that the oh the shaadi is

1442
00:50:18,199 --> 00:50:22,670
basically everything's left over after

1443
00:50:20,059 --> 00:50:25,339
you take out the long fibers the short

1444
00:50:22,670 --> 00:50:28,519
fibers the landline etc and so you're

1445
00:50:25,338 --> 00:50:30,650
gonna have a pelletized product that

1446
00:50:28,518 --> 00:50:32,149
smells a bit like a barn you can

1447
00:50:30,650 --> 00:50:33,679
actually smell it if you put your nose

1448
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:35,689
right up to the bag you can you can kind

1449
00:50:33,679 --> 00:50:38,179
of smell it through there first time

1450
00:50:35,688 --> 00:50:40,489
that we were deciding to see whether we

1451
00:50:38,179 --> 00:50:41,900
wanted to work with this we took a tray

1452
00:50:40,489 --> 00:50:43,728
we put it in our laundry room when we

1453
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:45,139
put some slug on in there and I I poured

1454
00:50:43,728 --> 00:50:47,419
some water over I wanted to see what

1455
00:50:45,139 --> 00:50:48,679
happened we went out to dinner we came

1456
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:51,499
back and opened up my house and like

1457
00:50:48,679 --> 00:50:53,599
what is that stink it smells like a barn

1458
00:50:51,498 --> 00:50:55,188
in here and it was the slug gun

1459
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:58,068
obviously it's not meant as an interior

1460
00:50:55,188 --> 00:51:00,858
product however when you put the slug on

1461
00:50:58,068 --> 00:51:02,900
around your plant material outside as it

1462
00:51:00,858 --> 00:51:05,208
dries up within about a day or so any of

1463
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:06,588
that odor is gone some people love the

1464
00:51:05,208 --> 00:51:07,188
smell of the barn some people hate the

1465
00:51:06,588 --> 00:51:08,570
smell of the barn

1466
00:51:07,188 --> 00:51:10,759
but it is a fact

1467
00:51:08,570 --> 00:51:13,220
of life that logon will have a slight

1468
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:15,410
odor to it when it's first applied but

1469
00:51:13,219 --> 00:51:16,849
within one to two days at the most

1470
00:51:15,409 --> 00:51:18,199
I challenge you to be able to smell

1471
00:51:16,849 --> 00:51:20,059
anything even if you put your nose right

1472
00:51:18,199 --> 00:51:22,129
up to it I'm really excited to try this

1473
00:51:20,059 --> 00:51:24,920
out in some of my raised beds next

1474
00:51:22,130 --> 00:51:26,510
season because I always hate battling

1475
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:27,559
slugs and I usually just take him and

1476
00:51:26,510 --> 00:51:30,230
chuck them into the woods you know

1477
00:51:27,559 --> 00:51:32,659
across my property but I love I love

1478
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:34,760
knowing that I can safely protect my

1479
00:51:32,659 --> 00:51:37,009
plants and not have to be so vigilant

1480
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:39,890
all the time and worry about losing you

1481
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:41,000
know my favorite vegetables right and

1482
00:51:39,889 --> 00:51:42,019
you know again remember this is

1483
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,090
something you'll put down in the

1484
00:51:42,019 --> 00:51:45,380
springtime as soon as you've determined

1485
00:51:44,090 --> 00:51:47,510
where your plants are going to be you

1486
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:49,430
put some slug on around them and then

1487
00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:50,990
you walk away you don't have to do

1488
00:51:49,429 --> 00:51:53,899
anything after that it's going to swell

1489
00:51:50,989 --> 00:51:56,029
up on its own but you need a band about

1490
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:58,340
four inches wide or so around the plant

1491
00:51:56,030 --> 00:52:00,440
so that the slugs can't cross over it oh

1492
00:51:58,340 --> 00:52:02,570
but it doesn't need to be thick it

1493
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:04,820
doesn't need to be mounted up one pellet

1494
00:52:02,570 --> 00:52:07,250
layer thick is there one probably or

1495
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:09,920
high is enough and if you want to try to

1496
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:11,630
do this as judiciously as possible you

1497
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:13,280
can spread your pellets around let them

1498
00:52:11,630 --> 00:52:15,530
swell up and then you can come back and

1499
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:16,760
see where are my holes you can't have

1500
00:52:15,530 --> 00:52:18,890
any holes you can't have any gaps

1501
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:20,900
because slugs will find their way

1502
00:52:18,889 --> 00:52:22,339
through those gaps to your plant so you

1503
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:24,230
can come back you just drop it a couple

1504
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:26,600
little pellets on top of the holes they

1505
00:52:24,230 --> 00:52:28,579
will then in turn swell up and naturally

1506
00:52:26,599 --> 00:52:29,719
felt on their own together you don't

1507
00:52:28,579 --> 00:52:30,920
have to you know you don't have to do

1508
00:52:29,719 --> 00:52:33,169
anything but put it down and let it

1509
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:34,820
swell on its own and it's going to stay

1510
00:52:33,170 --> 00:52:36,289
in place there for the entire season

1511
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:38,510
you don't you're not coming back every

1512
00:52:36,289 --> 00:52:41,329
time it rains this is a one-time

1513
00:52:38,510 --> 00:52:43,570
application per season that's great and

1514
00:52:41,329 --> 00:52:46,610
it brings up one last question for me

1515
00:52:43,570 --> 00:52:48,820
since you happen to be married to one of

1516
00:52:46,610 --> 00:52:52,190
the foremost entomologist in the country

1517
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:55,039
what are the effects of this product in

1518
00:52:52,190 --> 00:52:58,400
terms of beneficial insects or other

1519
00:52:55,039 --> 00:53:00,380
insects no negative effects no negative

1520
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:02,030
effects of it remember this is it I mean

1521
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:04,250
it's like putting a wool sweater around

1522
00:53:02,030 --> 00:53:06,650
your plant there's there's not any

1523
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:08,150
positive or negative effect there so

1524
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:10,070
it's really just slugs and snails it

1525
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:12,230
slugs and snails you know any other

1526
00:53:10,070 --> 00:53:14,000
pests will crawl right over it I mean

1527
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:15,769
it's it's it's not it's not stopping

1528
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,630
anything other than something that has a

1529
00:53:15,769 --> 00:53:19,250
mucous foot something that can be

1530
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:21,140
irritated I mean imagine rubbing a piece

1531
00:53:19,250 --> 00:53:22,460
of sandpaper on your eyeball that's what

1532
00:53:21,139 --> 00:53:25,838
it feels like to a slug trying to

1533
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:29,389
so for this stuff that's a good analogy

1534
00:53:25,838 --> 00:53:31,130
sorry sorry fed a patrique well I think

1535
00:53:29,389 --> 00:53:33,049
that's all of my questions for today I I

1536

1537

00:54:04,699 --> 00:54:08,299
considering better ways to propagate

1551
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:10,490
their plants as well as more sustainable

1552
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:11,450
solutions to plastic pots at least in

1553

we've switched over our entire farm this

1555
00:54:13,639 --> 00:54:16,909
year and now we'll be educating our

1556
00:54:15,170 --> 00:54:18,710
community on why our veggie starts are

1557
00:54:16,909 --> 00:54:20,058
in these containers instead of plastic

1558
00:54:18,710 --> 00:54:22,220
pots that they have to put into a

1559
00:54:20,059 --> 00:54:24,470
landfill plus the big benefit of

1560
