00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,259
welcome to the cannabis cultivation and

3
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,689
science podcast

4
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:24,118
I'm your host tad husky of KISS organics

5
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:25,829
this is the podcast where we discuss the

6
00:00:24,118 --> 00:00:27,778
cutting edge of organic growing from a

7
00:00:25,829 --> 00:00:29,698
science-based perspective and draw on

8
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:31,589
top experts from around the industry to

9
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:33,239
share their wisdom and knowledge you

10
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:34,770
know we talk a lot about soil testing on

11
00:00:33,238 --> 00:00:36,839
this podcast and how important it is

12
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:38,100
well I wanted to get someone on the show

13
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,350
to have a discussion about how to

14
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,090
understand and evaluate these soil tests

15
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:43,859
because getting a soil test is one thing

16
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,149
but understanding how to use that

17
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:45,869
information can be something else

18
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:49,079
entirely

19
00:00:45,869 --> 00:00:50,939
our guest this week is Erin Crozier Erin

22
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:59,520
grow room gr o WRU erin is passionate

23
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,590
about using soil and SAP testing to

24
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,120
improve the quality of soil and plants

25
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,460
Erin teachers growers how to

26
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:07,469
remineralize their soil and then work on

27
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:09,029
increasing plant health Erin has been

28
00:01:07,469 --> 00:01:10,978

29
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:13,349
and working in the industry almost as

30
00:01:10,978 --> 00:01:15,060
long over the last four years aaron has

31
00:01:13,349 --> 00:01:17,309
been doing soil amendment recommendation

32
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,618
for cultivation sites all across North

33
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:21,240
America erin is an organic grower and

34
00:01:19,618 --> 00:01:23,280
gardener the transition to organic

35
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:24,899
living soil after doing testing of

36
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,879
different methods in his personal garden

37
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,520
he is currently working on becoming a

38
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:31,560
certified crop advisor and if you want

39
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:33,269
help with soil testing analysis or

40
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,500
calculating the proper nutrient levels

41
00:01:33,269 --> 00:01:36,179
based on your soil test

42
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:40,759
we are working with Erin to offer his

43
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:40,759

category or you can go to grow are you

47
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:51,449
calm to reach him directly I'll have

links to everything we discussed as well

49
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:55,290
as the soil test analysis and some

50
00:01:53,188 --> 00:01:57,478
sample tests on the podcast page if you

51
00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:00,350
want to follow along with a soil test as

52
00:01:57,478 --> 00:02:03,239
we discuss it now onto the show

53
00:02:00,349 --> 00:02:05,819
Erin welcome to the show thanks for

54
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:08,068
having me great well hey I wanted to get

55
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:09,478
started talking a little bit about you

56
00:02:08,068 --> 00:02:12,000
and your background so we can give

57
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:14,010
listeners an idea of sort of how you got

58
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,039
into becoming a

59
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:20,219
soil and plant health consultant and

60
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:22,578
evaluating these soil tests well I've

61
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:27,449
always been interested in plants and

62
00:02:22,579 --> 00:02:32,459
nature and I have grown you know for

63
00:02:27,449 --> 00:02:35,548
myself for quite some time and I started

64
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:39,090
experimenting with different methods

65
00:02:35,549 --> 00:02:43,590
because basically I grew outdoors a long

66
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:45,628
time ago and friends of mine knew you

67
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:47,640
know to use particular amendments and

68
00:02:45,628 --> 00:02:49,169
get really good results

69
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:52,878
and they had shared with me some of

70
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:59,310
their tips and then years later I became

71
00:02:52,878 --> 00:03:04,138
sick and basically that's when I started

72
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:06,239
growing cannabis indoors and a friend of

73
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:09,269
mine he's like hey he got into my method

74
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:13,560
and set all this up and I really wanted

75
00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:15,689
to test and see what works so I I set up

76
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:19,949
a light and tested all the different

77
00:03:15,689 --> 00:03:26,549
methods like Eben's low and gwc and soil

78
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:30,060
and I've heard about buy up onyx and it

79
00:03:26,549 --> 00:03:32,310
was like organic and synthetic combined

80
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:36,959
was toko and that that seemed kind of

81
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:41,098
interesting to me so I tested it and it

82
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:46,739
worked well and then there was a guy who

83
00:03:41,098 --> 00:03:50,568
had a local cable TV show and he did

84
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:53,219
compost extracts and compost teas and

85
00:03:50,568 --> 00:03:55,439
one day he's at the Hybris store and I

86
00:03:53,219 --> 00:03:59,280
saw him there and said hey uh you know

87
00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:01,378
do you want to barter and teach me how

88
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:05,669
to use the microscope and do some

89
00:04:01,378 --> 00:04:08,789
testing I want to see if I'm using you

90
00:04:05,669 --> 00:04:11,579
know th or pure blend and I combined it

91
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:15,418
with some of these microbial inoculants

92
00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:20,819
or they're not linked even good and what

93
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:23,460
happens when you combine them so he

94
00:04:20,819 --> 00:04:27,810
agreed to teach me and and this guy he

95
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:30,539
didn't grow cannabis he just he had

96
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:33,449
you know grew vegetables and would do

97
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:37,560
experiments with succession and he had

98
00:04:33,449 --> 00:04:40,319
bees and a compost pile so I'd make a

99
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,879
compost tea I'd bring it to his house we

100
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:44,569
look at it in the microscope and he'd

101
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:48,329
say you know throw it away it's garbage

102
00:04:44,569 --> 00:04:52,769
and so I found a lot of the back

103
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:57,089
products you know weren't very good and

104
00:04:52,769 --> 00:05:00,689
so in a lot of the testing I saw a lot

105
00:04:57,089 --> 00:05:02,699
of things would put the microbes to

106
00:05:00,689 --> 00:05:04,918
sleep and they wouldn't if they wouldn't

107
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:07,168
do their job so he's like hey Aaron why

108
00:05:04,918 --> 00:05:09,870
why you test all these things why don't

109
00:05:07,168 --> 00:05:12,779
you just grow organic and then you don't

110
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:15,810
have to test you know what's a harmless

111
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:17,759
being done and I was like I haven't seen

112
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:20,189
anybody get the results you know and

113
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:26,668
he's like just do it you know try it so

114
00:05:20,189 --> 00:05:28,649
I switched one light to soil and I grew

115
00:05:26,668 --> 00:05:31,079
like a bunch of different pharaohs from

116
00:05:28,649 --> 00:05:33,389
seed and to feed all those evenly would

117
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:38,459
have been kind of difficult and I did

118
00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:40,079
really well the quality was great you

119
00:05:38,459 --> 00:05:42,389
know the yield was good and so I

120
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:47,279
switched over the rest of the room to

121
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:50,279
all soil and would you compost he

122
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:54,359
accomplished extracts basically rather

123
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:57,899
than teas and then I start seeing some

124
00:05:54,360 --> 00:06:01,680
problems where it wasn't performing as

125
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:05,549
well and that's when I started getting

126
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:09,569
into soil testing because a lot of what

127
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:12,210
I was being taught from the guy from

128
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:15,599
using a microscope seemed like he had

129
00:06:12,209 --> 00:06:17,189
blinders on in some ways that all those

130
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,289
things are going to do harm they're no

131
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:22,769
good and I was like and I asked well

132
00:06:19,288 --> 00:06:25,740
have you tested it so in testing it then

133
00:06:22,769 --> 00:06:28,589
it gave me and getting the soil test of

134
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:30,780
seeing what was going wrong and there

135
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:35,579
was very very high potassium and sodium

136
00:06:30,779 --> 00:06:39,000
and the calcium was very low and then

137
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:41,759
then it really led into what a lot of

138
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,430
people would say was oh you need more

139
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,289
I'll bag and the question was always

140
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:50,009
well if you're growing organic you know

141
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:51,780
you're not going to use cow mat and so I

142
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:54,089
found not a lot of people knew how to

143
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:57,029
fix the problems when it came to organic

144
00:06:54,089 --> 00:06:59,399
Google's just do if your compost extract

145
00:06:57,029 --> 00:07:02,579
or earthworm castings flurry doesn't fix

146
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:06,179
it then you know what else you supposed

147
00:07:02,579 --> 00:07:10,199
to do and I saw hey you need more cows

148
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:16,079
and how that relates to all the other

149
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:20,610
cations and then few years later there

150
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:24,509
was a company who wanted to have testers

151
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:28,980
for a dis biological advantage program

152
00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:32,909
and I went to a SAP analysis seminar and

153
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:35,220
they had speakers John Kemp and Kineo

154
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:36,930
and they spoke about people who have

155
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:40,530
been doing testing they've been doing

156
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:44,189
soil test testing and fat and how they

157
00:07:40,529 --> 00:07:47,189
learned a lot of problems deficiencies

158
00:07:44,189 --> 00:07:51,089
are really excesses so that really

159
00:07:47,189 --> 00:07:53,969
opened my eyes that you know when you're

160
00:07:51,089 --> 00:07:57,449
growing with hydro or conventional

161
00:07:53,970 --> 00:08:00,600
growing a lot of people over feed and

162
00:07:57,449 --> 00:08:03,990
there's math you can use to to make your

163
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:05,850
own nutrient plan and the same wasn't

164
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:08,850
kind of being applied to soil people are

165
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:11,730
making these really overloaded soils and

166
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:15,000
it was causing people problems and I saw

167
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:19,740
the same when I tried making a soil mix

168
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:22,230
and the plants were doing well and when

169
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:26,250
people then I started figuring out why

170
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:28,860
and then applying that to farms that I

171
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:34,080
worked with because I was doing

172
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:37,440
consulting and I had ran a 12,000 square

173
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:42,090
foot indoor warehouse and I started

174
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:45,030
working with outdoor farms and then a

175
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:46,830
few years ago and spoke at the living

176
00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:49,860
soil symposium and then that really

177
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:52,410
brought in a lot more soil testing work

178
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:55,500
and then was able to see across the

179
00:08:52,409 --> 00:08:59,250
board you know a lot of the

180
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:02,639
that was present so well you're really

181
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:04,889
known for is is soil testing and that's

182
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:06,629
sort of how I met you was through Jaya

183
00:09:04,889 --> 00:09:09,509
Palmer he introduced me to you and said

184
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:10,799
you should talk to this guy and I know

185
00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:12,960
you've been working with build us oil

186
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:16,559
and a few other companies and doing soil

187
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:19,200
testing analysis now

188
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:21,929
can we talk a little bit about sort of

189
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,629
the history of soil balancing which is

190
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:27,299
sort of where a lot of these concepts

191
00:09:24,629 --> 00:09:29,100
and target levels come from and then

192
00:09:27,299 --> 00:09:30,750
talk well we'll get into the soil

193
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,519
testing and the types of soil tests

194
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:34,830
after that but just a little background

195
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:38,129
into maybe William Albrecht and sort of

196
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:43,610
where Steve Solomon and a lot of these

197
00:09:38,129 --> 00:09:47,070
guys are basing their beliefs on yeah

198
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:52,830
yeah that's that's a I remember reading

199
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:54,390
hemp diseases and pests and in there you

200
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:56,570
know talks about everything you do for

201
00:09:54,389 --> 00:10:00,059
her healthy plants and in there he

202
00:09:56,570 --> 00:10:02,910
mentions you know Albrecht and how it

203
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:06,750
causes a stir of controversy in some

204
00:10:02,909 --> 00:10:12,209
circles and so basically Albrecht was a

205
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:14,460
guy who studied soil and how it

206
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:16,200
correlated to animal and human health

207
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:22,259
and he did that for over thirty years

208
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:26,129
all around the world and he then would

209
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:28,889
do testing and also compare things like

210
00:10:26,129 --> 00:10:32,580
looking at you viral transpiration

211
00:10:28,889 --> 00:10:34,679
ratios and the microbiology in the soil

212
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:36,900
and he found right down the center of

213
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:39,750
the United States where we had the

214
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:44,669
grasslands and bison was was like the

215
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:47,509
ideal soil and so he determined some

216
00:10:44,669 --> 00:10:50,879
ratios from her soil testing based on

217
00:10:47,509 --> 00:10:56,939
the total exchange capacity of soil and

218
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:58,919
some base saturations and that you know

219
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:01,410
when you when you search on google it'll

220
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:09,409
give you some some reviews that are

221
00:11:01,409 --> 00:11:12,059
trying a mixed and what I had found was

222
00:11:09,409 --> 00:11:13,949
in testing the soil a lot of the trace

223
00:11:12,059 --> 00:11:17,699
minerals weren't there and that's where

224
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:20,160
people were worried and concerned that

225
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:25,770
they were going to cost a lot of damage

226
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:27,629
and you know because sulfates were

227
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:30,809
abused in the past and people over

228
00:11:27,629 --> 00:11:33,139
applying verses with this method of kind

229
00:11:30,809 --> 00:11:37,309
of what they call soil balancing there's

230
00:11:33,139 --> 00:11:40,049
application limits for these minerals so

231
00:11:37,309 --> 00:11:43,169
when we also think about how soil was

232
00:11:40,049 --> 00:11:45,569
built in time it's better to build it up

233
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:47,939
slowly rather than just trying to hammer

234
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:51,510
it down with all these different

235
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:53,940
amendments yeah one of the things I want

236
00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:57,059
to mention for listeners is this idea of

237
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:59,070
soil balancing is is really founded on

238
00:11:57,059 --> 00:12:02,278
the work of Albrecht which dates back to

239
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:04,020
the 1930s so this is not a new concept

240
00:12:02,278 --> 00:12:06,990
or new technology now people have

241
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:08,610
changed some target levels and sort of

242
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:11,430
created correlations between different

243
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:14,070
minerals and trace elements that they

244
00:12:11,429 --> 00:12:15,989
believe grows better plants or healthier

245
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:19,080
plants but it all falls into this sort

246
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:21,509
of concept of soil balancing the idea of

247
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:23,250
getting the minerals at at target levels

248
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:25,350
and I just want to remind people that

249
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:27,690
these are our opinions that we're

250
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:30,540
sharing in this podcast they're based on

251
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:32,959
our experiences and our knowledge but

252
00:12:30,539 --> 00:12:36,059
again they are opinions there's no

253
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:38,129
standard really I would say for these

254
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:41,849
things other than maybe what Albrecht or

255
00:12:38,129 --> 00:12:46,559
some of these soil testing labs go off

256
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:48,629
of but it really is it really is based

257
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:51,000
on opinions of people who have you know

258
00:12:48,629 --> 00:12:54,870
agronomist or or people in the industry

259
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,309
who have had I guess good good

260
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:59,519
reputations I don't know is everything

261
00:12:56,309 --> 00:13:02,909
you want to add to that well the other

262
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:05,939
thing is when we consider soil versus

263
00:13:02,909 --> 00:13:07,620
soy to lift to a lot of this was done

264
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:11,490
with soil were you

265
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:15,269
you know sand silt and clay and so this

266
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:18,089
is I trying to create the right physical

267
00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:20,929
home for the biology because the way

268
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:22,830
calcium flocculate the soil and

269
00:13:20,929 --> 00:13:26,489
magnesium tightens it

270
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:28,889
and that's where through Albirex testing

271
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:31,830
he found you know a lot of the problems

272
00:13:28,889 --> 00:13:34,830
or a lack of mineral nutrition plants

273
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:39,120
don't have a pesticide deficiency it's a

274
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:41,070
it's a mineral problem and that's why

275
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,620
you has a saying you know insects or

276
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:46,230
nature's garbage collectors and diseases

277
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:49,470
or the clean up truth so in finding and

278
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:52,320
getting that balance that and the

279
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:54,028
minerals into the plant that's going to

280
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:58,410
make a plant that's going to have higher

281
00:13:54,028 --> 00:14:01,860
health and and quality and then in turn

282
00:13:58,409 --> 00:14:04,139
greater pest and disease resistance so

283
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:08,610
that's something that can't happen in

284
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:13,409
time it's not a it can take time happen

285
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:15,870
cuz microbiology can take time to get

286
00:14:13,409 --> 00:14:18,149
going it's like a big wheel that has a

287
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:20,610
lot of torque it's it's slow to get

288
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:23,940
going but once it gets rolling it's it's

289
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:26,610
very powerful yeah let's talk a little

290
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:28,440
bit about these these soil testing

291
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:30,990
options in terms of the types of soil

292
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:34,410
tests that are available and I want to

293
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:35,909
just remind people that so I saw a

294
00:14:34,409 --> 00:14:39,990
perfect soil test is not our ultimate

295
00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:41,458
goal a perfect soil test is great but at

296
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:43,500
the end of the day let's keep in mind

297
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:45,419
that the soil tests are not they're not

298
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:47,399
perfect and there is going to be

299
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:51,240
variability whether it's in the sampling

300
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:52,820
or in LA in the lab or just in the

301
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:56,820
abilities of these tests to really

302
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:59,070
properly measure levels the other thing

303
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:00,600
I want to mention is that if we are soil

304
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:03,959
testing we want to stay with the same

305
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:06,209
lab because you can't compare soil tests

306
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:08,698
between two different labs even if it's

307
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:09,778
the same type of test very effectively

308
00:15:08,698 --> 00:15:14,370
because there's just too much

309
00:15:09,778 --> 00:15:16,679
variability but can you can you talk to

310
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:18,750
us about some of the types of soil tests

311
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:21,479
I know a couple we're gonna talk about

312
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:24,059
in more detail or the the Mallik three

313
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:25,829
or standard soil test from from Logan

314
00:15:24,059 --> 00:15:30,088
labs as well as the saturated paste

315
00:15:25,828 --> 00:15:32,009
tests yes yes and that that's excellent

316
00:15:30,089 --> 00:15:34,500
point is good for people to remember

317
00:15:32,009 --> 00:15:36,600
that it's a tool to help you make more

318
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:41,730
educated decisions

319
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:44,329
and some people can get hung up if the

320
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:47,278
soil test isn't what they deem perfect

321
00:15:44,328 --> 00:15:48,769
you could have really good microbiology

322
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:54,689
and still do fine

323
00:15:48,769 --> 00:15:58,169
so the mate basically with Logan Labs we

324
00:15:54,690 --> 00:16:01,019
have a standard test and a saturated

325
00:15:58,169 --> 00:16:04,259
paste and a standard test uses an

326
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:06,539
extraction called malloc free and that's

327
00:16:04,259 --> 00:16:08,818
a stronger asset so it's going to show

328
00:16:06,539 --> 00:16:12,000
us I try to put it in layman's terms

329
00:16:08,818 --> 00:16:15,179
like it's your savings account of

330
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,458
minerals these are all what is stored in

331
00:16:15,179 --> 00:16:20,669
your soil and that you can eventually

332
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:24,559
make available but it's not necessarily

333
00:16:20,669 --> 00:16:27,509
available at these levels right now and

334
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:31,258
then the saturated paste is they take

335
00:16:27,509 --> 00:16:35,579
that same soil and grind it into a paste

336
00:16:31,259 --> 00:16:38,000
and then combine it with water and then

337
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:40,919
test what what's at least the minimum

338
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:44,370
levels of available nutrients to your

339
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:50,099
plant right now so that would show us

340
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:54,240
maybe we have could cation balance on

341
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:57,028
our spinner test which is our calcium

342
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,709
magnesium potassium and sodium but then

343
00:16:57,028 --> 00:17:01,919
when we look at our saturated paste

344
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:05,730
maybe sodium and potassium is very

345
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:08,188
available and then calcium is low and

346
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:11,429
that shows us that we've got to work on

347
00:17:08,189 --> 00:17:15,659
that availability or maybe we'll see the

348
00:17:11,429 --> 00:17:17,280
soil has a high pH and phosphorous and

349
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:19,500
some of the trace minerals are not as

350
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:22,139
available but then when we look at the

351
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:25,230
standard test they're actually there so

352
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:28,110
rather than applying more let's work on

353
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:31,110
the microbiology and improving the pH to

354
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:33,990
make them available and that way that

355
00:17:31,109 --> 00:17:38,189
type of testing works well with

356
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:41,370
biological farming or soil food web and

357
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:46,679
that we're looking at the whole thing as

358
00:17:41,369 --> 00:17:49,679
a system and how these minerals will

359
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:54,100
also benefit a lot of microbes

360
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:57,340
it's needed just like Cobalts for

361
00:17:54,099 --> 00:18:00,879
example with with bacteria in the soil

362
00:17:57,339 --> 00:18:03,569
becomes COBOL amine which is b12 and

363
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:07,210
that's a cofactor which is important for

364
00:18:03,569 --> 00:18:10,629
calcium availability nitrogen fixation

365
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:13,029
and so it's other process in this soil

366
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:16,470
that we're having all these men rules

367
00:18:13,029 --> 00:18:19,869
even in just very small amounts can help

368
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:21,910
now if we have a soil that is high in

369
00:18:19,869 --> 00:18:24,099
calcium there's something called a fizz

370
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:26,110
test that you that a grower can do to

371
00:18:24,099 --> 00:18:27,369
determine what type of soil test they're

372
00:18:26,109 --> 00:18:35,439
going to need can you talk a little bit

373
00:18:27,369 --> 00:18:37,959
about that yes so when we we look at the

374
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:41,049
soil there's a number value called

375
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:45,009
total cash and exchange capacity and if

376
00:18:41,049 --> 00:18:47,259
we imagine that is like a bucket and the

377
00:18:45,009 --> 00:18:51,039
bigger the bucket is the more nutrients

378
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:53,619
the soil can hold so what could happen

379
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:56,470
is people can apply a lot of calcium

380
00:18:53,619 --> 00:18:57,389
carbonate you know austere shell flour

381
00:18:56,470 --> 00:19:02,140
ag-lime

382
00:18:57,390 --> 00:19:06,880
or maybe even dolomite and their soil

383
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:10,030
let's say only has a TFE of 15 so it can

384
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:12,520
hold like 4000 pounds an acre of calcium

385
00:19:10,029 --> 00:19:14,559
and sometimes people are applying you

386
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:17,769
know ten twelve thousand pounds an acre

387
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:20,649
of calcium so in essence we have eight

388
00:19:17,769 --> 00:19:23,680
thousand pounds of free calcium in the

389
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:27,220
soil so if you take a sample of that

390
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:29,529
soil and you mix it with vinegar it will

391
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:33,039
fit because it's showing there's all the

392
00:19:29,529 --> 00:19:34,809
calcium carbonate is reacting and what

393
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:38,430
can happen is that can really elevate

394
00:19:34,809 --> 00:19:41,099
your ph and it can throw off the test

395
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:44,110
because when you have very very high

396
00:19:41,099 --> 00:19:47,740
calcium that's going to suppress the

397
00:19:44,109 --> 00:19:50,259
magnesium potassium and sodium value may

398
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:52,809
be lower than what you actually got but

399
00:19:50,259 --> 00:19:54,490
then when you look on your taste test it

400
00:19:52,809 --> 00:19:57,849
usually shows there oh we've got a

401
00:19:54,490 --> 00:20:01,089
really high level of available sodium

402
00:19:57,849 --> 00:20:03,339
and calcium is just a lot of free

403
00:20:01,089 --> 00:20:06,849
calcium it's not really

404
00:20:03,339 --> 00:20:10,929
available to the plan so we can get a

405
00:20:06,849 --> 00:20:14,589
test an ammonium acetate that's done at

406
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:18,279
a pH of 8.2 and then that gives us an

407
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:21,879
idea of how much available calcium there

408
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:24,879
is versus free calcium then I can

409
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:27,730
recalculate the total exchange capacity

410
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:31,780
and then give someone a recommendation

411
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:32,950
to then balance that out so just to

412
00:20:31,779 --> 00:20:35,410
summarize what you're sharing

413
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:37,900
essentially the malik three tests or

414
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:39,100
standard soil tests from Logan labs and

415
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:41,530
we're just using local lab because

416
00:20:39,099 --> 00:20:43,629
that's the lab that we both earlier and

417
00:20:41,529 --> 00:20:46,930
our careers decide to do our testing

418
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:48,760
with there's a lot of great labs out

419
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:50,140
there but for us it's very easy because

420
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:52,359
we're familiar with their testing

421
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:54,100
protocols but that Malak three tests or

422
00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:56,500
standard soil test is excellent for

423
00:20:54,099 --> 00:20:58,809
determining sort of all of what is in

424
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:00,849
the soil but not what's available that

425
00:20:58,809 --> 00:21:02,679
saturated pace test will then show us

426
00:21:00,849 --> 00:21:04,869
what's available to the plant more or

427
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:07,000
less right now but not all of what is

428
00:21:04,869 --> 00:21:09,250
actually in the soil so these two tests

429
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,309
combined really give us a full picture

430
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:14,500
of sort of what's going on in that soil

431
00:21:12,309 --> 00:21:17,109
and it's important if you're using a

432
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:20,230
potting soil in particular to make sure

433
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:21,729
you don't have excess calcium and it

434
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:23,140
could be our free calcium in that soil

435
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:25,360
because it'll throw off the test so

436
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:28,870
that's why that a a test is recommended

437
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:30,789
if you do a fizz test which I can put a

438
00:21:28,869 --> 00:21:32,349
link to an example of how to go about

439
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:34,329
doing that it's really easy with the

440
00:21:32,349 --> 00:21:36,609
vinegar and that allows you to just see

441
00:21:34,329 --> 00:21:39,549
what type of soil tests to request from

442
00:21:36,609 --> 00:21:43,869
Logan labs does that sort of cover it

443
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:46,899
yes and usually if your soils pH is

444
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:52,089
above 7/2 or so that's when that's

445
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:55,900
recommended so that you're going to get

446
00:21:52,089 --> 00:21:59,709
a elevated pH because you have a large

447
00:21:55,900 --> 00:22:03,040
access to calcium carbon alt all cations

448
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:06,279
can raise the pH but a lot of times it's

449
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:09,279
people over doing calcium carbonate and

450
00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:12,220
then if they have the high levels of

451
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:15,730
calcium carbonate or bicarbonate in

452
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:17,200
their water he can grab available

453
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:19,720
calcium in form or

454
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,340
calcium bicarbonate which isn't

455
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:23,829
available to the plants and further

456
00:22:21,339 --> 00:22:27,129
elevating a pH so that's why it's

457
00:22:23,829 --> 00:22:30,069
important to get a water test as well at

458
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:33,610
least one time to see what there's

459
00:22:30,069 --> 00:22:35,648
nothing that has high levels in your

460
00:22:33,609 --> 00:22:39,189
water that then could build up in your

461
00:22:35,648 --> 00:22:40,959
soil causing you issues yeah that's a

462
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:43,630
really good point mentoring mentioning

463
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:46,480
the water test and I wanted to give sort

464
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:48,580
of an anecdotal story here for listeners

465
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:51,639
something that happened recently in my

466
00:22:48,579 --> 00:22:54,308
life where I was contacted by a farmer

467
00:22:51,638 --> 00:22:57,668
and asked if I could help consult on

468
00:22:54,308 --> 00:22:59,379
setting up he's a tomato farmer that was

469
00:22:57,669 --> 00:23:03,159
growing hydroponically and was

470
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:05,440
transitioning over to soil so the first

471
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:09,100
thing I requested from him was a soil

472
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:10,269
test and a water test and for that soil

473
00:23:09,099 --> 00:23:12,609
test he's like well I've already

474
00:23:10,269 --> 00:23:15,190
purchased soil from another company and

475
00:23:12,609 --> 00:23:16,869
which is great and I just said can you

476
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:18,759
get a soil test to that so we we know

477
00:23:16,869 --> 00:23:20,949
where we're starting and see how that

478
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:23,379
soil looks so we can we can move on from

479
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:26,590
there and I got the to the soil test

480
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:27,970
back and frankly it wasn't where the

481
00:23:26,589 --> 00:23:30,750
target levels weren't anywhere near

482
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:33,069
where I I thought they should be and

483
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:34,929
from talking to that company we weren't

484
00:23:33,069 --> 00:23:37,418
able to really get a good determination

485
00:23:34,929 --> 00:23:40,870
if this test was an anomaly or if that

486
00:23:37,419 --> 00:23:42,700
was just the way all the soil was from

487
00:23:40,869 --> 00:23:45,308
this company so basically what it ended

488
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:47,139
up coming down to was neither myself nor

489
00:23:45,308 --> 00:23:50,470
the farmer had enough confidence in

490
00:23:47,138 --> 00:23:52,750
using that soil and so now he's sitting

491
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:54,909
on the soil that we're gonna slowly you

492
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:58,028
know try and balance over time but

493
00:23:54,909 --> 00:23:59,320
essentially the point being is no matter

494
00:23:58,028 --> 00:24:01,569
where you're getting your soul if you're

495
00:23:59,319 --> 00:24:03,609
purchasing soil you should get a soil

496
00:24:01,569 --> 00:24:06,609
test and if people aren't willing to

497
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:08,259
give you that soil test that's a problem

498
00:24:06,609 --> 00:24:10,990
you should you should probably look to

499
00:24:08,259 --> 00:24:12,369
another company and then in addition to

500
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,849
that if you're going right into the

501
00:24:12,369 --> 00:24:15,518
ground

502
00:24:12,849 --> 00:24:17,500
you still need that soil test so this is

503
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:19,690
such an important tool if you're growing

504
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:22,210
commercially and you're committing to

505
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:25,389
putting in a high value crop I mean this

506
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:26,590
this podcast is typically listened to by

507
00:24:25,388 --> 00:24:28,898
cannabis growers

508
00:24:26,589 --> 00:24:31,148
then you really do need to you know

509
00:24:28,898 --> 00:24:34,418
spend the fifty five dollars on a soil

510
00:24:31,148 --> 00:24:37,959
it's well worth it so that's my that's

511
00:24:34,419 --> 00:24:39,099
my soapbox uh I'll turn it back over to

512
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:42,819
you err and if anything you want to add

513
00:24:39,098 --> 00:24:45,009
yeah I think for there's no better bang

514
00:24:42,819 --> 00:24:49,479
for your buck when you look at what you

515
00:24:45,009 --> 00:24:52,690
can spend on nutrients or other products

516
00:24:49,479 --> 00:24:54,909
for you know sixty bucks for the

517
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:57,999
saturated paste and the standard and

518
00:24:54,909 --> 00:25:00,669
that's going to be complete plus extra

519
00:24:57,999 --> 00:25:07,028
so it's also going to include cobalt

520
00:25:00,669 --> 00:25:09,700
molybdenum selenium silicon and EC which

521
00:25:07,028 --> 00:25:14,048
are also you know could be a limiting

522
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:17,109
factor a lot of the micro nutrients are

523
00:25:14,048 --> 00:25:21,219
very important for regulating the macro

524
00:25:17,108 --> 00:25:23,319
nutrients so it's you could have

525
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:26,649
everything else really in check a good

526
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:29,858
environment all your major minerals but

527
00:25:26,648 --> 00:25:32,108
then lacking silicon and then your

528
00:25:29,858 --> 00:25:35,798
that's needed if you got the whole

529
00:25:32,108 --> 00:25:38,739
sequence of silicon boron and calcium to

530
00:25:35,798 --> 00:25:44,440
then carry all the minerals into the

531
00:25:38,739 --> 00:25:46,989
plant so you know and then you're not

532
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:49,419
going to apply more something else when

533
00:25:46,989 --> 00:25:51,369
that's all you need it so you're

534
00:25:49,419 --> 00:25:53,200
suggesting that they may actually save

535
00:25:51,368 --> 00:25:55,118
money by getting the soil test so that

536
00:25:53,200 --> 00:26:00,009
we're not over applying or under

537
00:25:55,118 --> 00:26:03,488
applying any micro or macro nutrient yes

538
00:26:00,009 --> 00:26:06,278
I often see people who think they have a

539
00:26:03,489 --> 00:26:08,499
this expectation that the plants are

540
00:26:06,278 --> 00:26:12,249
going to remove all these minerals and

541
00:26:08,499 --> 00:26:16,028
they blindly keep reom ending the soil

542
00:26:12,249 --> 00:26:19,569
and they don't need to apply that I had

543
00:26:16,028 --> 00:26:21,700
a customer that's a husband and wife and

544
00:26:19,569 --> 00:26:24,999
the husband runs some fields and the

545
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:27,759
wife runs some fields and so the husband

546
00:26:24,999 --> 00:26:30,819
got a soil amendment recommendation and

547
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:33,069
I sold them you know some some help and

548
00:26:30,819 --> 00:26:36,358
some nitrogen meal and then the trace

549
00:26:33,069 --> 00:26:38,829
minerals needed and he amended it and

550
00:26:36,358 --> 00:26:41,228
his wife couldn't believe that that's

551
00:26:38,829 --> 00:26:44,949
all you needed and she spent a lot of

552
00:26:41,229 --> 00:26:47,288
money buying all these you know products

553
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:51,340
marketed to growers from the Hydra store

554
00:26:47,288 --> 00:26:53,950
and then the husband did is good or

555
00:26:51,339 --> 00:26:56,918
better and in the next year or she came

556
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:59,409
in and hired me to do her applause and

557
00:26:56,919 --> 00:27:01,288
then when I told her hey this is all you

558
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:04,659
need and you have an abundance of

559
00:27:01,288 --> 00:27:08,440
nitrogen you know did you have mites or

560
00:27:04,659 --> 00:27:10,559
aphids or PM and she's like yeah how did

561
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:13,630
you know and I thought cuz you're

562
00:27:10,558 --> 00:27:16,960
putting on too much you know less is

563
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:19,539
more and when you see what's in the soil

564
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,970
it's it's really gonna make a difference

565
00:27:19,538 --> 00:27:24,069
and so she's like okay I'm gonna try it

566
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:27,759
because if I don't I'm never gonna see

567
00:27:24,069 --> 00:27:30,788
what happens and then followed up with

568
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:32,679
them just you know recently and and they

569
00:27:30,788 --> 00:27:36,190
were just super excited they're both

570
00:27:32,679 --> 00:27:39,190
doing really well because also as you do

571
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:41,528
this you know you're really building the

572
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:43,600
soil especially when it's a field you

573
00:27:41,528 --> 00:27:48,250
can go and take and turn the whole acre

574
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:50,859
into a you know all usable soil and do

575
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:54,490
amazing you know and a lot of people

576
00:27:50,859 --> 00:27:56,558
that can be a blocker to do an acre a

577
00:27:54,490 --> 00:28:00,399
potting soil would be you know whatwe

578
00:27:56,558 --> 00:28:02,829
out of their budget people can request a

579
00:28:00,398 --> 00:28:05,619
soil test but then they don't really

580
00:28:02,829 --> 00:28:08,470
know what to do with that information so

581
00:28:05,619 --> 00:28:10,178
they they get a soil test done on a soil

582
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:11,889
or they get a soil test from another

583
00:28:10,179 --> 00:28:14,380
company that may be providing them with

584
00:28:11,888 --> 00:28:15,729
soil or a nutrient or whatever but what

585
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:17,380
do you do with that information it's

586
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:20,829
very confusing to look at all these

587
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:23,590
numbers and and understand them which is

588
00:28:20,829 --> 00:28:26,638
one of the big challenges so I'd really

589
00:28:23,589 --> 00:28:29,888
like to whether you just starting with a

590
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:33,069
regular sole report if we could work our

591
00:28:29,888 --> 00:28:36,908
way down that soil report and you know

592
00:28:33,069 --> 00:28:39,398
what I'll I'll put a copy of a sample so

593
00:28:36,909 --> 00:28:42,370
report on the podcast page so people can

594
00:28:39,398 --> 00:28:45,038
kind of go and check that out too but

595
00:28:42,369 --> 00:28:46,479
let's just do you happen to have a Logan

596
00:28:45,038 --> 00:28:47,888
labs one in front of you that you could

597
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,269
kind of go off of or do you want me just

598
00:28:47,888 --> 00:28:52,388
kind of list the things as we're working

599
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:54,548
our way down the down the report i yeah

600
00:28:52,388 --> 00:28:57,609
i have a logan house report and then I

601
00:28:54,548 --> 00:28:58,779
could share an example you know of soil

602
00:28:57,609 --> 00:29:02,219
and saturated

603
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:05,889
and then how I do a soil amendment

604
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:09,029
recommendation so what I try to do is I

605
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:12,340
go through each item on this test and

606
00:29:09,029 --> 00:29:16,359
explain you know or how are you doing

607
00:29:12,339 --> 00:29:20,049
are you high low very high and where you

608
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:22,599
should be and then then I tell you

609
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:25,809
here's how much to apply for per yard or

610
00:29:22,599 --> 00:29:28,329
if you have a particular size field or

611
00:29:25,809 --> 00:29:31,179
bed I'll make the recommendation best on

612
00:29:28,329 --> 00:29:34,329
that and then I give instructions also

613
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:38,259
how to apply it and then I give some

614
00:29:34,329 --> 00:29:41,589
tips to based on where you're at you

615
00:29:38,259 --> 00:29:44,769
know here's some suggestions to help you

616
00:29:41,589 --> 00:29:50,379
improve things until the soil gets more

617
00:29:44,769 --> 00:29:53,259
balanced like maybe you've got very high

618
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:56,380
potassium and sodium and that's

619
00:29:53,259 --> 00:29:59,829
inhibiting your magazines uptake feet of

620
00:29:56,380 --> 00:30:04,330
the soil so all just trying to go

621
00:29:59,829 --> 00:30:09,009
through a test and then some of the

622
00:30:04,329 --> 00:30:11,019
values and that are on here how's that

623
00:30:09,009 --> 00:30:12,789
show that sounds great maybe a few

624
00:30:11,019 --> 00:30:14,170
sentences about each one because there's

625
00:30:12,789 --> 00:30:15,789
quite a few this could turn into a

626
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:16,960
really long podcast but let's yeah let's

627
00:30:15,789 --> 00:30:19,089
work our way down I think that's

628
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:23,350
important so I'll go ahead and let you

629
00:30:19,089 --> 00:30:26,609
take it away break so the the test is

630
00:30:23,349 --> 00:30:26,609
going to come out you're going to have a

631
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:33,849
sample rotation and a sample ID a lab

632
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:37,000
number that's more just for identifying

633
00:30:33,849 --> 00:30:41,859
your sample if you send in various

634
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:43,990
samples and I want to just really quick

635
00:30:41,859 --> 00:30:45,609
talk about the soil sample before I go

636
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:50,259
into that too because we didn't cover

637
00:30:45,609 --> 00:30:53,439
that it's good to take a composite

638
00:30:50,259 --> 00:30:56,619
sample of maybe 15 or different places

639
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:58,960
in your soil and it's good to use wear

640
00:30:56,619 --> 00:31:01,629
gloves so that way you don't transfer

641
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:04,600
sodium from your hands and if you're

642
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:06,640
using a shovel or a spade or something

643
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:08,678
you don't want it to be rusty because

644
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:12,400
that could transfer iron over to your

645
00:31:08,679 --> 00:31:12,640
sample and basically I want to take 15

646
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:16,330
or

647
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:18,700
more poor samples combine all those mix

648
00:31:16,329 --> 00:31:22,240
them together and then I'm sending two

649
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:25,750
cups of soil into Logan labs and on that

650
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:29,049
bag I will write you know my name email

651
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:31,839
and then iid too so that way I knew

652
00:31:29,049 --> 00:31:33,759
there was a bad one been to and that's

653
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:37,959
going to correlate with with your farm

654
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:40,210
or garden and if you have a problem area

655
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:43,539
you could take a separate sample for

656
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:47,289
that otherwise that's how you're going

657
00:31:43,539 --> 00:31:51,879
to get a composite sample and then back

658
00:31:47,289 --> 00:31:53,680
to our test the after we have our ID and

659
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:56,590
lab number it's going to say total

660
00:31:53,680 --> 00:32:00,430
exchange capacity and that's going to be

661
00:31:56,589 --> 00:32:04,139
a number to give us how much nutrients

662
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:09,850
the soil can hold so this particular

663
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:12,850
soils 15 full exchange capacity if it's

664
00:32:09,849 --> 00:32:15,399
below 10 it doesn't hold a lot of

665
00:32:12,849 --> 00:32:19,779
nutrients and so sometimes you may have

666
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:22,509
to fertilize more often some crossed we

667
00:32:19,779 --> 00:32:24,430
need another top transmitted before you

668
00:32:22,509 --> 00:32:27,759
go in the flower if you're vegging a

669
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:29,620
longer time when the TC is below 10 and

670
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:32,710
then all my recommendations are going to

671
00:32:29,619 --> 00:32:36,309
be for a lower amount of minerals next

672
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:40,420
is the pH of the soil sample ideally

673
00:32:36,309 --> 00:32:43,569
want that around 6 to 6 v pH as a pH

674
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:46,360
climbs above 7 we lose exchangeable

675
00:32:43,569 --> 00:32:49,450
hydrogen and it's harder for the plant

676
00:32:46,359 --> 00:32:52,389
to get the minerals out of the soil the

677
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:55,390
next value we have is organic matters in

678
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:57,370
a percentage and organic matter is going

679
00:32:55,390 --> 00:33:00,430
to be very important for our soil food

680
00:32:57,369 --> 00:33:03,009
web and the microbiology for each

681
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:06,160
percentage of organic matter is going to

682
00:33:03,009 --> 00:33:12,190
release nitrogen and we ideally want

683
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:15,759
that above 10% and a lot of a soilless

684
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:18,430
mixes peat moss comes back right fresh

685
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:22,539
out of the bag it's 90% organic matter

686
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:26,440
so Logan tends to test a little higher

687
00:33:22,539 --> 00:33:28,389
than other labs on organic matter I find

688
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:30,430
one thing I wanted to add about organic

689
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:32,950
matter too is the higher organic matter

690
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:35,950
is if you have good microbial activity

691
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:38,319
the less you know quote-unquote soil

692
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:40,390
you're going to have at the end of your

693
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:42,549
cycle it's just like in a raised bed in

694
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:43,810
your garden you know every year it goes

695
00:33:42,549 --> 00:33:46,809
down a little bit

696
00:33:43,809 --> 00:33:49,210
that's that process of all your organic

697
00:33:46,809 --> 00:33:51,519
matter breaking down slowly into houmous

698
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:53,559
and so it's not a it's not a bad thing

699
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:55,180
but that higher that number keep that in

700
00:33:53,559 --> 00:33:58,869
mind because you may have to replace

701
00:33:55,180 --> 00:34:04,029
more soil the following season to get to

702
00:33:58,869 --> 00:34:07,479
get that back up yes yes especially will

703
00:34:04,029 --> 00:34:09,269
see that more so on native soils where

704
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:13,570
they really need the organic matter

705
00:34:09,269 --> 00:34:15,909
built up of course after time and

706
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:19,840
everything's became humid then it could

707
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:22,389
be the same case with soilless mixes but

708
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:24,370
they tend to get heavier in time when

709
00:34:22,389 --> 00:34:29,200
when it's really you're doing things

710
00:34:24,369 --> 00:34:32,319
right the next value we're gonna have on

711
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:37,059
the test is anions and we're going to

712
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:42,159
have sulfur and that ideally you want at

713
00:34:37,059 --> 00:34:45,849
least 35 ppm of sulfur and we could go

714
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:50,950
as high as equal to phosphorous on the

715
00:34:45,849 --> 00:34:53,519
sulfur phosphorus has been next and it

716
00:34:50,949 --> 00:34:58,689
showed as p2o5

717
00:34:53,519 --> 00:35:01,900
usually and we multiply times 0.44 to

718
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:04,960
get actual phosphorous one thing i want

719
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:06,700
to add about sulfur is that's where a

720
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:09,099
lot of our odors and flavors our

721
00:35:06,699 --> 00:35:11,559
terpenes come from so it's important

722
00:35:09,099 --> 00:35:13,329
that we have that that sulfur in there

723
00:35:11,559 --> 00:35:15,039
so that we can get that expression in

724
00:35:13,329 --> 00:35:17,650
our final flower if we're growing if

725
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:21,039
we're going cannabis for example yes

726
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:23,470
it's also important for nitrogen oxygen

727
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:26,980
you know processing nitrogen in the

728
00:35:23,469 --> 00:35:30,489
plant sadly there it doesn't have free

729
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:34,389
ions because that's what can be a

730
00:35:30,489 --> 00:35:37,469
calling card for pests when the plant is

731
00:35:34,389 --> 00:35:40,059
not processing the proteins is

732
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:44,219
processing the nitrogen in to come

733
00:35:40,059 --> 00:35:47,469
we proteins when there's sulfur slacking

734
00:35:44,219 --> 00:35:50,739
that doesn't happen and also elemental

735
00:35:47,469 --> 00:35:54,189
sulfur can attract sulfur reducing

736
00:35:50,739 --> 00:35:56,709
bacteria which combined with your soil

737
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:59,440
getting some runoff can help to lower

738
00:35:56,710 --> 00:36:01,960
the pH because if you have excess

739
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:05,260
cations like calcium magnesium potassium

740
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:08,230
or sodium the sulfur will combine with

741
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:12,340
calcium make calcium sulfate and then

742
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:14,710
help to reach excess and calcium sulfate

743
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:16,750
is gypsum just for people that may not

744
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:18,070
be familiar with that term and it's one

745
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:20,440
of the easiest ways to raise yourself

746
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:23,950
four levels and also maintain your pH

747
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:26,110
while getting calcium in there too yes

748
00:36:23,949 --> 00:36:30,069
and you can also get it in a solution

749
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:32,740
grade so that way if you're not tilling

750
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:36,390
your soil it's easier to irrigate in and

751
00:36:32,739 --> 00:36:39,849
immediately raise the available calcium

752
00:36:36,389 --> 00:36:42,339
wonderful and so that's what's next on

753
00:36:39,849 --> 00:36:46,449
the test is exchangeable cations and

754
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:48,700
then it shows calcium and it will show

755
00:36:46,449 --> 00:36:53,769
us our desired value and then the value

756
00:36:48,699 --> 00:36:58,179
found and the same goes we'll have

757
00:36:53,769 --> 00:37:01,329
magnesium potassium and sodium and then

758
00:36:58,179 --> 00:37:04,779
after those are listed it's going to

759
00:37:01,329 --> 00:37:10,349
show us the base saturation of calcium

760
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:13,330
and magnesium potassium sodium and

761
00:37:10,349 --> 00:37:18,699
exchangeable hydrogen so we're shooting

762
00:37:13,329 --> 00:37:22,090
for at least 68% cows on the calcium 10

763
00:37:18,699 --> 00:37:26,739
to 12 on the magnesium three to five to

764
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:29,800
calcium and ideally we want 1.5 percent

765
00:37:26,739 --> 00:37:33,519
or less sodium and an exchangeable

766
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:38,560
hydrogen ideally want a pH in the range

767
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:44,409
of 6 to 6 5 and for each point of pH

768
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:46,989
drop below below 7 we gain 1.5 percent

769
00:37:44,409 --> 00:37:52,809
exchangeable hydrogen all the way down

770
00:37:46,989 --> 00:37:54,019
to a pH of 6 so pH of 7 you have zero

771
00:37:52,809 --> 00:37:59,989
exchangeable hyzer

772
00:37:54,019 --> 00:38:02,449
in 6.9 it's 1.5% 6.8 it's 3% and so on

773
00:37:59,989 --> 00:38:04,929
and so on and that's where when you look

774
00:38:02,449 --> 00:38:07,129
at a lot of those charts that show pH

775
00:38:04,929 --> 00:38:09,980
it's really showing you how much

776
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:12,170
hydrogen you have and that's how the

777
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:14,539
plant has easier time getting the

778
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:18,680
minerals out of the soil the higher you

779
00:38:14,539 --> 00:38:21,380
push it above 7 sometimes that can cause

780
00:38:18,679 --> 00:38:25,699
problems with availability of

781
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:29,809
phosphorous and trace minerals can I

782
00:38:25,699 --> 00:38:31,639
have a couple notes here so for new new

783
00:38:29,809 --> 00:38:33,880
people looking at these tests keep in

784
00:38:31,639 --> 00:38:36,469
mind that the part where it says

785
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:38,119
exchangeable cations they're where they

786
00:38:36,469 --> 00:38:41,509
have a desired value and value found

787
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:43,730
that desired value is based off of your

788
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:46,340
cation exchange capacity or your total

789
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:48,079
exchange capacity so the idea being is

790
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:49,970
that exchange capacity is sort of your

791
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:52,069
sponge as I like to describe it you use

792
00:38:49,969 --> 00:38:54,259
savings account and it's like how are we

793
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:56,900
filling that sponge or that saving scale

794
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:58,820
what are we filling it with so I I think

795
00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:00,500
it's easier to just skip down to sort of

796
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:03,500
the base saturation percentage and say

797
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:06,320
okay well my sponge is 60 percent

798
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:08,659
calcium 20 percent magnesium or whatever

799
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:11,000
those levels come back as reflected on

800
00:39:08,659 --> 00:39:12,529
the test now I know you and I have

801
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,420
talked about this I like to run

802
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:17,360
potassium slightly higher because I see

803
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:20,570
multiple tests coming the potassium good

804
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:23,240
cannabis using potassium faster then

805
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:26,420
some of then say calcium or necessarily

806
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:29,779
magnesium which I'm totally open to your

807
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:32,980
feedback on but again these are target

808
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:36,230
levels that are sort of established by

809
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:39,170
by consultants or by agronomists and

810
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:41,539
there really isn't any anything I've

811
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:43,700
seen officially for cannabis out there

812
00:39:41,539 --> 00:39:46,219
so they're all sort of based on what

813
00:39:43,699 --> 00:39:48,939
target levels we all think at based on

814
00:39:46,219 --> 00:39:53,480
our experiences are optimal for cannabis

815
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:55,970
yes and it's to give you a range you

816
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:58,130
know as well and of course there's going

817
00:39:55,969 --> 00:40:00,399
to be different situations you know

818
00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:02,980
maybe somebody's a high intensity

819
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:07,539
farming in a controlled environment

820
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:07,539
where they have co2 and

821
00:40:07,579 --> 00:40:12,739
things enhance versus somebody who's

822
00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:18,920
doing a full term outdoor or a different

823
00:40:12,739 --> 00:40:23,509
situation so I find that the potassium

824
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:26,539
you know cannabis it does like a lot of

825
00:40:23,509 --> 00:40:29,478
potassium but if it's in excess it will

826
00:40:26,539 --> 00:40:32,869
inhibit the uptake of calcium so what's

827
00:40:29,478 --> 00:40:35,149
really important I found was how much

828
00:40:32,869 --> 00:40:38,930
was potassium was in the soil to start

829
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:43,130
and then going from there because a lot

830
00:40:38,929 --> 00:40:45,828
of times people mix compost eat and all

831
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:48,380
their amendments and then they add all

832
00:40:45,829 --> 00:40:50,329
the amendments and test it and they

833
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:53,568
never saw where they were to start so

834
00:40:50,329 --> 00:40:56,809
that's kind of skewed and so then when I

835
00:40:53,568 --> 00:41:01,548
look at the taste test it'll usually be

836
00:40:56,809 --> 00:41:04,609
potassium is very high and when I used a

837
00:41:01,548 --> 00:41:07,608
SAP meter I can test how much calcium

838
00:41:04,608 --> 00:41:10,639
potassium is getting into the plant and

839
00:41:07,608 --> 00:41:13,728
I've seen on because I grew in the soil

840
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:15,018
that had you know 15 percent potassium I

841
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:17,808
don't want to see how long it would take

842
00:41:15,018 --> 00:41:20,598
to correct itself how long does it take

843
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:23,170
to leach out and fix that and I would

844
00:41:20,599 --> 00:41:26,088
always see three to six thousand ppm of

845
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:29,778
potassium and calcium would never be

846
00:41:26,088 --> 00:41:32,150
above a hundred and two hundred so after

847
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:35,869
growing in that and it got down to five

848
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:38,180
percent potassium I was seeing three

849
00:41:35,869 --> 00:41:41,660
thousand plus ppm of calcium in the

850
00:41:38,179 --> 00:41:44,538
plant and my bricks would be eighteen to

851
00:41:41,659 --> 00:41:49,159
twenty plus before that and would all it

852
00:41:44,539 --> 00:41:51,380
would be seven to maybe ten so it made a

853
00:41:49,159 --> 00:41:54,409
big difference in that instance because

854
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:57,588
the soil was built with a very very high

855
00:41:54,409 --> 00:42:00,578
level of capacity and so she a really

856
00:41:57,588 --> 00:42:03,548
large amount of compost was added and

857
00:42:00,579 --> 00:42:06,920
it's just a lot of time to really

858
00:42:03,548 --> 00:42:10,400
balance out and it wasn't until I saw

859
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:12,318
the taste test that it really showed how

860
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,298
all the balance it was because when I

861
00:42:12,318 --> 00:42:17,208
look at the standard test all the

862
00:42:14,298 --> 00:42:20,719
numbers look great and I found a lot of

863
00:42:17,208 --> 00:42:21,348
people had a misrepresentation Oh my

864
00:42:20,719 --> 00:42:23,358
standards

865
00:42:21,349 --> 00:42:26,390
looks fine why are my plants yellowing

866
00:42:23,358 --> 00:42:29,150
and seen these problems well the sodium

867
00:42:26,389 --> 00:42:32,568
is much more available and the potassium

868
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:34,608
is much available and we it's like a

869
00:42:32,568 --> 00:42:37,699
teeter-totter this scooted towards

870
00:42:34,608 --> 00:42:41,869
potassium in we wanted more calcium to

871
00:42:37,699 --> 00:42:43,489
be 60% not potassium and so a little

872
00:42:41,869 --> 00:42:47,269
spoon feeding a little bit of that

873
00:42:43,489 --> 00:42:49,219
gypsum really helps to balance that out

874
00:42:47,268 --> 00:42:52,488
and that's why a lot of people say oh

875
00:42:49,219 --> 00:42:57,289
you need calmac because it's doing the

876
00:42:52,489 --> 00:42:59,539
same kind of thing so it's really

877
00:42:57,289 --> 00:43:03,739
interesting to see that now people tell

878
00:42:59,539 --> 00:43:07,039
me oh this is what happening and then be

879
00:43:03,739 --> 00:43:09,528
able to correct that because I've seen

880
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:13,160
it many many times now where people said

881
00:43:09,528 --> 00:43:17,298
hey my plants are they're yellowing that

882
00:43:13,159 --> 00:43:20,239
are you know the tips are burns you know

883
00:43:17,298 --> 00:43:23,208
and they have a high pH a lot of

884
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:27,798
carbonate a lot of potassium and sodium

885
00:43:23,208 --> 00:43:30,379
and high really high alright and that's

886
00:43:27,798 --> 00:43:34,009
also not a good home for the

887
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:36,410
microbiology that's right you know so

888
00:43:34,009 --> 00:43:38,630
we're going to start working on our soil

889
00:43:36,409 --> 00:43:40,879
food web and we got this home that's

890
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:43,278
full of chloride in sodium they're just

891
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:46,369
gonna get dehydrated out not do their

892
00:43:43,278 --> 00:43:48,889
job so getting that balance really

893
00:43:46,369 --> 00:43:52,789
helped for the soil food web balance and

894
00:43:48,889 --> 00:43:54,650
they complement each other so that's

895
00:43:52,789 --> 00:43:57,680
where I found and shared with the guy

896
00:43:54,650 --> 00:44:00,048
who mentored me hey look I've applied

897
00:43:57,679 --> 00:44:03,618
topper I apply these trace minerals and

898
00:44:00,048 --> 00:44:06,248
I'm seeing better results than before at

899
00:44:03,619 --> 00:44:13,548
small amounts it's not as damaging as

900
00:44:06,248 --> 00:44:18,108
eStock and you know in some instances

901
00:44:13,548 --> 00:44:20,208
it's it was the limiting factor so that

902
00:44:18,108 --> 00:44:23,509
gets onto your micronutrients on the

903
00:44:20,208 --> 00:44:25,429
test and if you get a standard test

904
00:44:23,509 --> 00:44:30,489
without the excess you'll have boron

905
00:44:25,429 --> 00:44:34,569
iron manganese copper zinc and aluminum

906
00:44:30,489 --> 00:44:37,929
if we request extras will also get COBOL

907
00:44:34,570 --> 00:44:40,660
molybdenum selenium silicon and EC and

908
00:44:37,929 --> 00:44:43,619
then ideally we also want to see

909
00:44:40,659 --> 00:44:47,469
ammonium nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen

910
00:44:43,619 --> 00:44:49,809
because then we can really gauge whether

911
00:44:47,469 --> 00:44:53,829
we need to apply a nitrogen meal or not

912
00:44:49,809 --> 00:44:56,769
or whether there was a huge excess and

913
00:44:53,829 --> 00:45:01,420
people can make a more educated decision

914
00:44:56,769 --> 00:45:06,489
on what to apply and then for those

915
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:08,860
minerals like for on the levels that we

916
00:45:06,489 --> 00:45:12,819
want to see is going to vary on your Tec

917
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:15,280
if you're below your 10 you want to see

918
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:20,350
at least 1 ppm versus you're at a higher

919
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:25,030
TC we want to see 2 to 3 ppm iron is

920
00:45:20,349 --> 00:45:29,650
next and I often see iron is very high a

921
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:32,410
lot of times people will the composter

922
00:45:29,650 --> 00:45:38,829
tsiyon iron castings is high in iron and

923
00:45:32,409 --> 00:45:42,399
then some of the rock dusts are so iron

924
00:45:38,829 --> 00:45:46,119
does have issues with availability as

925
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:49,630
well especially when the pH is higher

926
00:45:46,119 --> 00:45:52,269
Maggie's is another one I often see is

927
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:54,940
lacking and we have all the conditions

928
00:45:52,269 --> 00:45:57,309
for manganese deficiency and a lot of

929
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:59,980
the living soils that are built we have

930
00:45:57,309 --> 00:46:04,269
high levels of carbonate high levels of

931
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:07,269
organic matter high if there's a free

932
00:46:04,269 --> 00:46:10,780
calcium that can contribute to a problem

933
00:46:07,269 --> 00:46:13,960
of manganese if sodium of calcium on the

934
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:15,910
base a a ssin is above 10 percent the

935
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:18,750
plants not going to pick up magnesium

936
00:46:15,909 --> 00:46:21,129
the soil and then iron and manganese are

937
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:23,500
antagonistic to each other high iron

938
00:46:21,130 --> 00:46:26,340
suppresses manganese and high manganese

939
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:30,699
school suppress iron so we want to see

940
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:32,380
about half the magnin's to the iron we

941
00:46:30,699 --> 00:46:35,339
can even push them pretty close but we

942
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:39,550
don't want manganese going above iron

943
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:42,070
copper is very important for disease

944
00:46:39,550 --> 00:46:44,380
resistance and if you have very high

945
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:46,809
nitrate nitrogen it's going to suppress

946
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:48,550
the uptake of copper you like to see at

947
00:46:46,809 --> 00:46:52,719
least 4 ppm of

948
00:46:48,550 --> 00:46:56,560
or then think that's going to be

949
00:46:52,719 --> 00:46:59,949
important for phosphorus and other leaf

950
00:46:56,559 --> 00:47:03,900
size and evenness and we want to see 8

951
00:46:59,949 --> 00:47:09,579
ppm of zinc at least up to maybe 12

952
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:12,720
lumen 'm we want to see under 200 ppm of

953
00:47:09,579 --> 00:47:16,719
aluminum that's usually okay on most

954
00:47:12,719 --> 00:47:18,819
soilless mixes it's more native soils

955
00:47:16,719 --> 00:47:22,149
where I see higher levels of aluminum or

956
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:26,230
if somebody has overly applied azomite

957
00:47:22,150 --> 00:47:30,610
to their soilless mix I seen a guy apply

958
00:47:26,230 --> 00:47:34,659
a half a cup a cubic foot and he had 4

959
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:36,400
or 500 ppm of aluminum so it's wait way

960
00:47:34,659 --> 00:47:37,719
too much and there I usually if

961
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,849
someone's going to use a semi it's

962
00:47:37,719 --> 00:47:44,889
better to stick to 100 grams or less

963
00:47:39,849 --> 00:47:47,409
yard now I have a question about that

964
00:47:44,889 --> 00:47:50,829
one because I was under the

965
00:47:47,409 --> 00:47:52,179
understanding that that azomite was high

966
00:47:50,829 --> 00:47:54,549
in aluminum but then when I went back

967
00:47:52,179 --> 00:47:55,989
and look at one of their tests of what

968
00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:58,420
they're claiming on the label the

969
00:47:55,989 --> 00:48:03,250
aluminum levels were actually quite low

970
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:04,329
so I've sort of pulled back on my state

971
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:07,599
in my statement there

972
00:48:04,329 --> 00:48:11,259
have you seen otherwise or anything else

973
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:14,610
to reflect that well that's where I was

974
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:17,860
told that concern and then I saw a test

975
00:48:14,610 --> 00:48:20,950
where the you know customers aluminum

976
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:23,099
was very very high and then we followed

977
00:48:20,949 --> 00:48:26,889
up on the phone after his guests I said

978
00:48:23,099 --> 00:48:29,679
what did you do he goes oh I built you

979
00:48:26,889 --> 00:48:31,869
know to mix and I didn't have any rock

980
00:48:29,679 --> 00:48:34,710
dust all I had was as a mine so I

981
00:48:31,869 --> 00:48:40,420
applied it at a half-cup perturbing foot

982
00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:42,880
and so you know unless there was some

983
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:45,639
other factor like he had a compost high

984
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:48,039
in aluminum or something then I could be

985
00:48:45,639 --> 00:48:50,619
wrong you know okay I just wasn't sure

986
00:48:48,039 --> 00:48:52,900
if you had heard otherwise but that's

987
00:48:50,619 --> 00:48:55,509
just one instance that then I played it

988
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:58,119
safe I'm like hey if if you better have

989
00:48:55,510 --> 00:49:02,320
a diversity of other rock dusts because

990
00:48:58,119 --> 00:49:05,289
I found the unless it was a glacial

991
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:07,660
rock dust a lot of the other base all

992
00:49:05,289 --> 00:49:11,320
than those was was higher in iron and

993
00:49:07,659 --> 00:49:15,279
wasn't it is in balance of other trace

994
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:19,390
minerals so sticking to a smaller amount

995
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:22,510
of rock dust we still want it but then I

996
00:49:19,389 --> 00:49:25,210
wanted to bring up those trace minerals

997
00:49:22,510 --> 00:49:27,490
by using you know sulphate trace

998
00:49:25,210 --> 00:49:30,369
minerals which if you get a soil test

999
00:49:27,489 --> 00:49:33,299
and you show that they're lacking

1000
00:49:30,369 --> 00:49:37,989
that's Om RI a National Organic Program

1001
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:42,100
approved as organic so that's other

1002
00:49:37,989 --> 00:49:43,709
importance of getting a soil test then

1003
00:49:42,099 --> 00:49:45,639
you're gonna make a more educated

1004
00:49:43,710 --> 00:49:48,670
decision of what you're going to apply

1005
00:49:45,639 --> 00:49:52,960
just what's needed and then help

1006
00:49:48,670 --> 00:49:55,059
minimize any runoff ur you know like

1007
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:57,579
excess nitrogen or phosphorus even

1008
00:49:55,059 --> 00:50:01,210
though it's organic it still can do harm

1009
00:49:57,579 --> 00:50:04,119
to the earth so the soil testing can

1010
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:06,579
really help Beauty to dial-in those

1011
00:50:04,119 --> 00:50:09,429
levels and bring up you know what's the

1012
00:50:06,579 --> 00:50:11,799
lowest common denominator you know it

1013
00:50:09,429 --> 00:50:13,569
may be just your you've got silicon or

1014
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:15,820
we would say hey you got a real high

1015
00:50:13,570 --> 00:50:20,050
access up something else and it's

1016
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:21,430
causing you a deficiency so what you're

1017
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:24,400
referring to is all of these are

1018
00:50:21,429 --> 00:50:26,710
available in a sulfate form more or less

1019
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:29,889
so you can get iron sulfate or manganese

1020
00:50:26,710 --> 00:50:32,170
sulfate or copper sulfate or zinc

1021
00:50:29,889 --> 00:50:36,909
sulfate for example where they're

1022
00:50:32,170 --> 00:50:39,400
already chelated to sulfur and they are

1023
00:50:36,909 --> 00:50:41,859
not organic but they're allowed for use

1024
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:46,059
in organic production if you have a soil

1025
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:48,550
test that shows a deficiency correct and

1026
00:50:46,059 --> 00:50:50,230
some of them are listed om RI organic on

1027
00:50:48,550 --> 00:50:54,190
it but that's where people get confused

1028
00:50:50,230 --> 00:50:56,309
because you know it's something mind

1029
00:50:54,190 --> 00:50:59,920
that there was a man-made interaction

1030
00:50:56,309 --> 00:51:03,639
you know and those some of those like

1031
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:06,309
copper is 25 percent copper so by

1032
00:51:03,639 --> 00:51:08,980
applying a small amount you know like 9

1033
00:51:06,309 --> 00:51:11,739
grams a cubic yard we're going to bring

1034
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:14,110
those levels up versus if I was just

1035
00:51:11,739 --> 00:51:16,269
spoon feeding something that was a lower

1036
00:51:14,110 --> 00:51:18,550
level of copper that were

1037
00:51:16,269 --> 00:51:20,889
smells a band-aid but it doesn't bring

1038
00:51:18,550 --> 00:51:24,820
the levels enough to up enough in the

1039
00:51:20,889 --> 00:51:27,099
soil to correct a deficiency so that's

1040
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:31,360
where I had tested that at first you

1041
00:51:27,099 --> 00:51:34,679
liked using you know bottle products

1042
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:39,640
that were small percentages 2% 0.5%

1043
00:51:34,679 --> 00:51:41,769
boron and and supplying them and then

1044
00:51:39,639 --> 00:51:45,309
doing another soil testing saying hey

1045
00:51:41,769 --> 00:51:48,070
that didn't raise my levels so to me

1046
00:51:45,309 --> 00:51:49,960
that felt a lot like hydroponics the

1047
00:51:48,070 --> 00:51:52,809
fertilizer salesman selling you this

1048
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:55,059
stuff wants you to buy more I said I'm

1049
00:51:52,809 --> 00:51:57,159
gonna test this and apply these trace

1050
00:51:55,059 --> 00:51:59,710
minerals and then see what happens

1051
00:51:57,159 --> 00:52:02,349
because the guys I was working with were

1052
00:51:59,710 --> 00:52:04,389
working with vegetable farmers with

1053
00:52:02,349 --> 00:52:08,799
hundreds of acres and they didn't have

1054
00:52:04,389 --> 00:52:11,319
the budget or or you know material to

1055
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:13,630
apply it accurately versus cannabis

1056
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:16,840
growers usually have raised beds or

1057
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:19,539
plots and it's not always acres where we

1058
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:22,720
can really amend that soil and do each

1059
00:52:19,539 --> 00:52:25,659
bad and test each bed so I did that on

1060
00:52:22,719 --> 00:52:29,230
two beds and tested and applied the

1061
00:52:25,659 --> 00:52:32,710
trace minerals and I was within less

1062
00:52:29,230 --> 00:52:35,500
than 5% so it's very on and what I did

1063
00:52:32,710 --> 00:52:37,929
is I took all the trace minerals I mixed

1064
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:39,699
them with water and then I applied into

1065
00:52:37,929 --> 00:52:42,489
the soil that way I could apply them

1066
00:52:39,699 --> 00:52:45,399
very evenly because imagine trying to

1067
00:52:42,489 --> 00:52:49,089
spread you know five point five grams of

1068
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:51,880
boron across toerner gallons of soil

1069
00:52:49,090 --> 00:52:53,620
it'd be easy to get a little hot spot or

1070
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:57,430
sprinkler that everywhere would be

1071
00:52:53,619 --> 00:52:59,799
difficult so by combining with water we

1072
00:52:57,429 --> 00:53:02,589
could mix it spread it it would bring

1073
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:04,410
those mineral levels up and then I don't

1074
00:53:02,590 --> 00:53:08,019
have to do that anymore

1075
00:53:04,409 --> 00:53:09,279
so therefore I can grow more plants it's

1076
00:53:08,019 --> 00:53:11,920
going to come out there they're going to

1077
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:13,330
be balanced I compost them or bring it

1078
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:15,430
back in the soil that's going to help

1079
00:53:13,329 --> 00:53:19,329
make those minerals even more available

1080
00:53:15,429 --> 00:53:21,279
and I can close the loop so even though

1081
00:53:19,329 --> 00:53:24,309
it may seem okay we're bringing in these

1082
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:26,590
minerals to do this we're just trying to

1083
00:53:24,309 --> 00:53:29,079
build that up and therefore we don't

1084
00:53:26,590 --> 00:53:29,710
have to do it anymore cuz then all the

1085
00:53:29,079 --> 00:53:32,199
plan

1086
00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:37,510
animals humans also going to be getting

1087
00:53:32,199 --> 00:53:39,279
that nutrient-dense crops or food and

1088
00:53:37,510 --> 00:53:42,460
then everything is healthier down the

1089
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:44,790
line yeah I do want to mention that you

1090
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:46,630
talked about those bottled products and

1091
00:53:44,789 --> 00:53:48,818
essentially the two companies not

1092
00:53:46,630 --> 00:53:50,289
familiar with that are making chelated

1093
00:53:48,818 --> 00:53:52,329
bottled nutrient products that are

1094
00:53:50,289 --> 00:53:55,659
approved for organics would be Albion

1095
00:53:52,329 --> 00:53:57,609
and biomen and we carry the biome in

1096
00:53:55,659 --> 00:53:59,348
line one of the things I like about them

1097
00:53:57,608 --> 00:54:02,679
is there's something that can be watered

1098
00:53:59,349 --> 00:54:04,420
in throughout the grow cycle for as a

1099
00:54:02,679 --> 00:54:06,669
way of raising these levels and maybe

1100
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:09,460
available a little bit sooner to the

1101
00:54:06,670 --> 00:54:11,349
plant then say something like copper

1102
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:14,500
sulfate which we have to be very careful

1103
00:54:11,349 --> 00:54:17,140
with our application with because of its

1104
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:18,940
potential toxicity in plant response and

1105
00:54:17,139 --> 00:54:21,848
we're adding so little like you

1106
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:24,490
mentioned so I totally agree with you on

1107
00:54:21,849 --> 00:54:26,440
a commercial scale or on farmland or

1108
00:54:24,489 --> 00:54:29,049
acreage it doesn't make a lot of sense

1109
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:32,019
to use these products if you have you

1110
00:54:29,050 --> 00:54:34,359
know a facility or a smaller garden then

1111
00:54:32,019 --> 00:54:35,588
I think these products may have a sort

1112
00:54:34,358 --> 00:54:37,690
of niche there where they may have

1113
00:54:35,588 --> 00:54:41,818
benefit so I just wanted to make that

1114
00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:44,740
distinction yes and I also want to

1115
00:54:41,818 --> 00:54:47,798
elaborate that those are good as

1116
00:54:44,739 --> 00:54:50,469
band-aid fixes until you get the

1117
00:54:47,798 --> 00:54:54,099
minerals built up and available yes

1118
00:54:50,469 --> 00:54:57,429
so you tm7 is another one you could use

1119
00:54:54,099 --> 00:54:59,530
or where we're going to spoon-feed those

1120
00:54:57,429 --> 00:55:02,649
trace minerals and after a run or two

1121
00:54:59,530 --> 00:55:04,480
we've built all those levels up where it

1122
00:55:02,650 --> 00:55:08,280
could just be done a few times or

1123
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:11,679
monthly rather than a weekly to help

1124
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:15,880
just because for example manganese has a

1125
00:55:11,679 --> 00:55:17,798
max application rate and so usually it

1126
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:20,440
can take three or four times to really

1127
00:55:17,798 --> 00:55:25,088
get the manganese up to half a higher

1128
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:28,599
nin some cases so that gives us a way to

1129
00:55:25,088 --> 00:55:31,210
foliar entrench a small amount and then

1130
00:55:28,599 --> 00:55:33,460
we can help things to make sure there's

1131
00:55:31,210 --> 00:55:37,030
plenty for the soil and the microbes in

1132
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:39,548
the plant and they're not going to be

1133
00:55:37,030 --> 00:55:40,980
deficient because a lot of those also

1134
00:55:39,548 --> 00:55:43,480
are not mobile

1135
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:45,670
so by crossing

1136
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:49,030
Maggie's and calcium you're going to

1137
00:55:45,670 --> 00:55:50,950
sure that it's always in the plants and

1138
00:55:49,030 --> 00:55:52,720
then you're gonna get your soul food web

1139
00:55:50,949 --> 00:55:55,119
your put your solicited and become more

1140
00:55:52,719 --> 00:55:58,899
bioavailable and then that won't be

1141
00:55:55,119 --> 00:56:01,599
needed as much so K it can really help

1142
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:04,269
because when you follow your spray the

1143
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:07,119
roots exude more sugars things ooh dates

1144
00:56:04,269 --> 00:56:09,369
which then speeds up the microbiology

1145
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:13,449
and healthy plants will make healthy

1146
00:56:09,369 --> 00:56:16,630
soil faster yeah and there are studies

1147
00:56:13,449 --> 00:56:18,849
that show that the plant is able to

1148
00:56:16,630 --> 00:56:21,550
buffer the pH based on the exudates it's

1149
00:56:18,849 --> 00:56:23,650
putting out into the rhizosphere so even

1150
00:56:21,550 --> 00:56:26,019
if your soil pH is a little off if the

1151
00:56:23,650 --> 00:56:29,260
pH in the rhizosphere could actually be

1152
00:56:26,019 --> 00:56:32,530
closer to optimal for the plant which I

1153
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:35,680
thought was really interesting yes yes I

1154
00:56:32,530 --> 00:56:38,260
saw university of delft or they decide

1155
00:56:35,679 --> 00:56:41,679
to stay they were showing pH up to seven

1156
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:45,850
point four wasn't showing any visual

1157
00:56:41,679 --> 00:56:46,389
problems in the plant so that's where

1158
00:56:45,849 --> 00:56:49,389
else

1159
00:56:46,389 --> 00:56:52,089
I feel more testing needs to be done

1160
00:56:49,389 --> 00:56:54,849
because I hear that a lot people well

1161
00:56:52,090 --> 00:56:58,030
the plant was fine well a plant can have

1162
00:56:54,849 --> 00:57:00,849
a lot of hidden deficiencies and what

1163
00:56:58,030 --> 00:57:03,790
looks fine but it's really not it could

1164
00:57:00,849 --> 00:57:05,199
be improved from where it is it could

1165
00:57:03,789 --> 00:57:07,179
have greater pests and disease

1166
00:57:05,199 --> 00:57:10,960
resistance or fit-up grade or higher

1167
00:57:07,179 --> 00:57:15,730
Brix and so by using these other tools

1168
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:17,949
it helps us to get a better idea of our

1169
00:57:15,730 --> 00:57:21,730
baseline where we're at and how we can

1170
00:57:17,949 --> 00:57:24,129
make improvements and I see a lot of

1171
00:57:21,730 --> 00:57:28,059
assumptions being made oh the plants

1172
00:57:24,130 --> 00:57:31,680
fine it's healthy and I've tested it's

1173
00:57:28,059 --> 00:57:35,440
not and it's it seems to be the norm

1174
00:57:31,679 --> 00:57:37,629
we're instead of hey let's let's not

1175
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:40,360
look at this with an ego at all and look

1176
00:57:37,630 --> 00:57:44,160
at it try to ask the plant and see what

1177
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:46,840
we can do you know just when you go to

1178
00:57:44,159 --> 00:57:49,119
you know blueberry growers or something

1179
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:52,300
he's not there's not all that Ito

1180
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:57,279
sometimes - and that's not always the

1181
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:59,920
case but it's always interesting that

1182
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:02,320
people will tell me this that you know

1183
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:04,690
our plants are super healthy and then

1184
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:08,010
I'll go there and see that they're you

1185
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:11,470
know high in nitrogen and the Brix is 5

1186
00:58:08,010 --> 00:58:15,580
so there's definitely room for

1187
00:58:11,469 --> 00:58:17,489
improvement yeah and it's not supporting

1188
00:58:15,579 --> 00:58:20,199
one down it's just trying to say hey

1189
00:58:17,489 --> 00:58:23,649
let's look at how we can improve things

1190
00:58:20,199 --> 00:58:26,500
and become more efficient because then

1191
00:58:23,650 --> 00:58:29,410
you need less fertilizer as the soil

1192
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:31,900
becomes more balanced it becomes less

1193
00:58:29,409 --> 00:58:34,319
extractive so you're not going to lose

1194
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:36,430
those minerals from the soil as much and

1195
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:39,100
everything is going to be getting in the

1196
00:58:36,429 --> 00:58:40,889
plant much higher so it's really

1197
00:58:39,099 --> 00:58:44,500
interesting you know when you look at a

1198
00:58:40,889 --> 00:58:46,329
you know rain forest or something you

1199
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:48,130
know it doesn't have a high ec but

1200
00:58:46,329 --> 00:58:51,460
everything is is thriving

1201
00:58:48,130 --> 00:58:54,610
because everything's being delivered by

1202
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:57,699
microbes microbial metabolites and the

1203
00:58:54,610 --> 00:59:01,390
plants is exchanging with them they're

1204
00:58:57,699 --> 00:59:05,309
giving it back what it needs and so

1205
00:59:01,389 --> 00:59:05,309
sometimes you know a lot of times that

1206
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:10,930
we want to help things that we can do

1207
00:59:08,019 --> 00:59:14,380
too much and by having some tools to

1208
00:59:10,929 --> 00:59:17,949
gauge what to do it can help make more

1209
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:20,470
educated decisions and better results

1210
00:59:17,949 --> 00:59:22,539
you know and in turn it can save money

1211
00:59:20,469 --> 00:59:25,839
too because you're not over applying

1212
00:59:22,539 --> 00:59:28,389
fertilizers either so let's talk a

1213
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:30,070
little bit about the saturated pace test

1214
00:59:28,389 --> 00:59:31,089
here just to keep things moving along

1215
00:59:30,070 --> 00:59:32,800
was there anything else though you

1216
00:59:31,090 --> 00:59:36,100
wanted to add about the the standard

1217
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:39,670
test before we did I know that covers

1218
00:59:36,099 --> 00:59:42,339
everything but you want to write in your

1219
00:59:39,670 --> 00:59:44,860
test if you get one from Logan in the

1220
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:48,400
comments you write complete plus extras

1221
00:59:44,860 --> 00:59:50,519
and that's how you get the nitrogen the

1222
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:54,700
ammonium nitrogen the cobalt molybdenum

1223
00:59:50,519 --> 00:59:56,849
selenium silicon and easy and then that

1224
00:59:54,699 --> 01:00:00,909
will also get you a saturated taste test

1225
00:59:56,849 --> 01:00:03,969
so to go over to the saturated paste it

1226
01:00:00,909 --> 01:00:06,549
starts off with the water used so if I

1227
01:00:03,969 --> 01:00:08,949
send in my water and get it tested they

1228
01:00:06,550 --> 01:00:10,630
could also perform the saturated paste

1229
01:00:08,949 --> 01:00:12,879
with your water

1230
01:00:10,630 --> 01:00:16,210
so get a more realistic idea of what's

1231
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:18,760
happening in your garden then it's going

1232
01:00:16,210 --> 01:00:22,269
to show us the pH it's going to show us

1233
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:25,510
the soluble salts which it's going to

1234
01:00:22,269 --> 01:00:27,730
show us chloride which is important to

1235
01:00:25,510 --> 01:00:31,990
see cuz if that's too high that can hit

1236
01:00:27,730 --> 01:00:36,429
other anions or inhibit the microbiology

1237
01:00:31,989 --> 01:00:39,189
from going bicarbonate we don't we want

1238
01:00:36,429 --> 01:00:42,009
50 to 100 ppm we don't that would show

1239
01:00:39,190 --> 01:00:46,929
us maybe our water had excessive

1240
01:00:42,010 --> 01:00:53,410
bicarbonate sulfur we want to see at

1241
01:00:46,929 --> 01:00:57,009
least 5 ppm available phosphorus we want

1242
01:00:53,409 --> 01:01:00,549
to see at least point 5 ppm there we're

1243
01:00:57,010 --> 01:01:05,470
gonna see that's much lower than what we

1244
01:01:00,550 --> 01:01:10,060
see on our standard test the highest

1245
01:01:05,469 --> 01:01:12,069
icings may be hundred something TPM and

1246
01:01:10,059 --> 01:01:16,179
compost and in the soil

1247
01:01:12,070 --> 01:01:21,370
I saw 54 ppm so that's what we're

1248
01:01:16,179 --> 01:01:24,219
looking maybe our 30 40 ppm or last so

1249
01:01:21,369 --> 01:01:27,130
that way we know our my Carissa is doing

1250
01:01:24,219 --> 01:01:29,769
its job and we're not going hammering it

1251
01:01:27,130 --> 01:01:33,610
with excessive phosphorus so it's more

1252
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:37,780
important pH and microbial activity to

1253
01:01:33,610 --> 01:01:39,610
get your phosphorous more available the

1254
01:01:37,780 --> 01:01:44,110
next we're going to have our calcium and

1255
01:01:39,610 --> 01:01:47,500
ppm or magnesium or potassium and sodium

1256
01:01:44,110 --> 01:01:49,360
and all those are just listed in ppm

1257
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:53,110
then below that we're going to have our

1258
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:55,329
percentage of cations and so there

1259
01:01:53,110 --> 01:01:57,519
that's where we want to compare to our

1260
01:01:55,329 --> 01:02:00,610
base saturation and we'd like to see at

1261
01:01:57,519 --> 01:02:05,019
least 50 percent calcium 20 percent

1262
01:02:00,610 --> 01:02:08,289
magnesium 15 percent potassium and 5% or

1263
01:02:05,019 --> 01:02:10,599
less sodium and if that was to do the

1264
01:02:08,289 --> 01:02:13,840
other way to tell us that we have maybe

1265
01:02:10,599 --> 01:02:16,509
a calcium available you problem or we

1266
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:19,710
would see on our standard test maybe we

1267
01:02:16,510 --> 01:02:22,570
have really high sodium and potassium

1268
01:02:19,710 --> 01:02:24,099
then past that it gets into the trace

1269
01:02:22,570 --> 01:02:29,019
elements

1270
01:02:24,099 --> 01:02:32,289
boron iron manganese copper zinc and

1271
01:02:29,019 --> 01:02:36,880
aluminum so boron we'd like to see at

1272
01:02:32,289 --> 01:02:42,869
least point 1 ppm iron 0.3 ppm

1273
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:48,099
mag knees point 1 5 ppm copper 0.5 ppm

1274
01:02:42,869 --> 01:02:51,369
succinct 0.1 ppm and keep in mind this

1275
01:02:48,099 --> 01:02:54,639
is water with your soil made into a

1276
01:02:51,369 --> 01:02:56,980
paste so the acids thanks do dates from

1277
01:02:54,639 --> 01:02:59,109
your roots it's probably stronger than

1278
01:02:56,980 --> 01:03:01,510
this and can probably extract higher

1279
01:02:59,110 --> 01:03:04,720
levels of nutrients than what we're

1280
01:03:01,510 --> 01:03:08,620
seeing here but at least we know what's

1281
01:03:04,719 --> 01:03:11,189
our lowest common you know baseline of

1282
01:03:08,619 --> 01:03:16,029
what is available and how does it differ

1283
01:03:11,190 --> 01:03:23,289
from our base test so I could see for

1284
01:03:16,030 --> 01:03:28,690
example maybe copper is at 3 ppm but I

1285
01:03:23,289 --> 01:03:31,029
got point 5 ppm copper on my paste then

1286
01:03:28,690 --> 01:03:33,900
we could avoid you know adding more

1287
01:03:31,030 --> 01:03:37,540
because we have plenty available copper

1288
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:40,930
so by using both these tests I can make

1289
01:03:37,539 --> 01:03:43,690
the more educated decision on on what's

1290
01:03:40,929 --> 01:03:46,419
available and what to work on and then

1291
01:03:43,690 --> 01:03:49,360
as we do another run and do another test

1292
01:03:46,420 --> 01:03:52,900
we can see for example maybe we improve

1293
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:55,630
that cation exchange balance on calcium

1294
01:03:52,900 --> 01:04:00,099
magnesium potassium and sodium we

1295
01:03:55,630 --> 01:04:04,030
brought up available phosphorus you know

1296
01:04:00,099 --> 01:04:05,739
we see things coming to range and I

1297
01:04:04,030 --> 01:04:07,330
would add to that watering is very

1298
01:04:05,739 --> 01:04:11,559
important in this because when we're

1299
01:04:07,329 --> 01:04:13,809
adding a lot of these you know meals for

1300
01:04:11,559 --> 01:04:15,309
example we're not putting them in an

1301
01:04:13,809 --> 01:04:17,139
icky lated form that the plant can

1302
01:04:15,309 --> 01:04:20,799
immediately uptake we're putting them in

1303
01:04:17,139 --> 01:04:23,409
a form where the microbiology in the

1304
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:26,230
soil needs to break down these nutrients

1305
01:04:23,409 --> 01:04:28,210
into a form an ionic form that the plant

1306
01:04:26,230 --> 01:04:29,800
can then take up and while this is

1307
01:04:28,210 --> 01:04:32,349
controlled by the plant itself by the

1308
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:33,010
the exudates that's putting out into the

1309
01:04:32,349 --> 01:04:34,900
rhizosphere

1310
01:04:33,010 --> 01:04:37,030
but I think that's an important

1311
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:39,059
distinction to mention because when we

1312
01:04:37,030 --> 01:04:41,290
water improper

1313
01:04:39,059 --> 01:04:43,360
what we're doing is we're slowing down

1314
01:04:41,289 --> 01:04:45,099
that process so less nutrients are going

1315
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:48,039
to become available so even if our

1316
01:04:45,099 --> 01:04:49,779
saturated pace tests may show these

1317
01:04:48,039 --> 01:04:51,820
level of nutrients available we could

1318
01:04:49,780 --> 01:04:54,519
still potentially see deficiencies if

1319
01:04:51,820 --> 01:04:59,950
the environmental conditions around the

1320
01:04:54,519 --> 01:05:02,769
plant are not optimal yes and especially

1321
01:04:59,949 --> 01:05:05,949
if you're not tracking it and you know

1322
01:05:02,769 --> 01:05:08,349
you you're seeing your EC ppm drop and

1323
01:05:05,949 --> 01:05:10,929
you're you're you're not doing anything

1324
01:05:08,349 --> 01:05:13,480
to bring that back up or you're not the

1325
01:05:10,929 --> 01:05:15,819
my soul food webs not improving to then

1326
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:20,409
bring up the available minerals there

1327
01:05:15,820 --> 01:05:23,110
then you know we gonna require some

1328
01:05:20,409 --> 01:05:25,000
interaction on your part and it's the

1329
01:05:23,110 --> 01:05:28,539
difference being we're feeding the soil

1330
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:32,800
versus the plant we're using water

1331
01:05:28,539 --> 01:05:36,039
insoluble yet plant-available amendments

1332
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:40,890
that way the microbiology can break it

1333
01:05:36,039 --> 01:05:44,440
down and deliver it to the plant but the

1334
01:05:40,889 --> 01:05:48,489
watering very very important you know

1335
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:52,960
see a lot of under and over watering and

1336
01:05:48,489 --> 01:05:56,500
then getting getting that right moisture

1337
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:59,050
level to be tricky and especially in the

1338
01:05:56,500 --> 01:06:01,469
cases sometimes people have high sodium

1339
01:05:59,050 --> 01:06:05,050
and need a little bit of push through

1340
01:06:01,469 --> 01:06:08,859
not so much that you know the term flush

1341
01:06:05,050 --> 01:06:12,190
I think you know when it's defined by

1342
01:06:08,860 --> 01:06:14,559
some people's being it is taking the

1343
01:06:12,190 --> 01:06:18,480
wrong way it's we don't necessarily want

1344
01:06:14,559 --> 01:06:21,789
to flush three times the volume of water

1345
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:24,869
but to get a little runoff when you do

1346
01:06:21,789 --> 01:06:27,039
have an excess can definitely help you

1347
01:06:24,869 --> 01:06:29,980
you know and that's where the soil test

1348
01:06:27,039 --> 01:06:32,889
really helps to know whether that's

1349
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:35,079
needed or not and a lot of times if

1350
01:06:32,889 --> 01:06:37,539
we're running blue mats and when we're

1351
01:06:35,079 --> 01:06:41,769
sticking it that nice moisture level

1352
01:06:37,539 --> 01:06:44,860
that's not happening so coming in with a

1353
01:06:41,769 --> 01:06:48,009
wand applying a compost extract or

1354
01:06:44,860 --> 01:06:51,250
getting a little bit of a push through

1355
01:06:48,010 --> 01:06:52,360
there helps to prevent the sodium from

1356
01:06:51,250 --> 01:06:54,670
building up

1357
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:57,340
the same thing we had you know salt

1358
01:06:54,670 --> 01:07:03,460
water we evaporated the water the the

1359
01:06:57,340 --> 01:07:06,880
salt becomes very concentrated so a lot

1360
01:07:03,460 --> 01:07:10,570
of the composts then we have a lot of

1361
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:14,220
items from the ocean so they all tend to

1362
01:07:10,570 --> 01:07:16,870
be kind of high in sodium and so does

1363
01:07:14,219 --> 01:07:21,750
you know manure tends to be as well

1364
01:07:16,869 --> 01:07:23,859
dairy manure that's been composted too

1365
01:07:21,750 --> 01:07:26,530
but we're seeing you know when the

1366
01:07:23,860 --> 01:07:29,140
compost is really finished then those

1367
01:07:26,530 --> 01:07:32,110
levels tend to drop this as and get more

1368
01:07:29,139 --> 01:07:34,779
balanced yeah is there anything that you

1369
01:07:32,110 --> 01:07:36,340
see in general more commonly across

1370
01:07:34,780 --> 01:07:39,220
tests I know we were just talking about

1371
01:07:36,340 --> 01:07:42,970
high sodium which like you mentioned can

1372
01:07:39,219 --> 01:07:45,189
be leached out through you know watering

1373
01:07:42,969 --> 01:07:47,529
a bed at higher levels are there other

1374
01:07:45,190 --> 01:07:49,720
things that u s-- tend to see like I

1375
01:07:47,530 --> 01:07:52,000
know we've talked about maybe over

1376
01:07:49,719 --> 01:07:55,980
application of calcium carbonate instead

1377
01:07:52,000 --> 01:08:01,000
of calcium sulfate so using gypsum over

1378
01:07:55,980 --> 01:08:04,510
lime products for example yeah I see

1379
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:07,869
that often because also wasn't accounted

1380
01:08:04,510 --> 01:08:09,790
for what was in the compost and a lot of

1381
01:08:07,869 --> 01:08:13,719
the composts are already very high in

1382
01:08:09,789 --> 01:08:16,720
calcium so you don't need to apply all

1383
01:08:13,719 --> 01:08:19,929
that much it can vary you know where you

1384
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:22,449
are you know in the country you know

1385
01:08:19,930 --> 01:08:26,289
each source is different to assume that

1386
01:08:22,449 --> 01:08:27,880
all that is the same is just a really

1387
01:08:26,289 --> 01:08:32,260
big difference I've seen a Midwest

1388
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:34,869
compost that had an EC of six I've seen

1389
01:08:32,260 --> 01:08:37,270
compost on the East Coast and then it

1390
01:08:34,869 --> 01:08:39,159
didn't have much nutrient value and then

1391
01:08:37,270 --> 01:08:43,900
some of the stuff on the west coast is

1392
01:08:39,159 --> 01:08:47,108
really loaded up so by testing it really

1393
01:08:43,899 --> 01:08:49,838
helped to see that and I often see you

1394
01:08:47,109 --> 01:08:53,740
know there's no trace the trace minerals

1395
01:08:49,838 --> 01:09:00,539
are lacking excessive sodium and

1396
01:08:53,739 --> 01:09:03,369
potassium and the pH is often very high

1397
01:09:00,539 --> 01:09:06,130
because people keep amending with more

1398
01:09:03,369 --> 01:09:13,210
calcium carbonate and

1399
01:09:06,130 --> 01:09:15,819
keep driving that up sometimes so it's

1400
01:09:13,210 --> 01:09:19,869
better to see where you're at and then

1401
01:09:15,819 --> 01:09:22,480
you got plenty of calcium you know then

1402
01:09:19,869 --> 01:09:25,630
you can stop applying that and just

1403
01:09:22,479 --> 01:09:28,149
spoon feed a small amount it's much more

1404
01:09:25,630 --> 01:09:31,960
effective than putting large large

1405
01:09:28,149 --> 01:09:38,259
amounts if a little bit is good a little

1406
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:40,029
bit less more often is better so that a

1407
01:09:38,259 --> 01:09:45,250
lot of people that's what I see they're

1408
01:09:40,029 --> 01:09:47,770
just over applying things and not

1409
01:09:45,250 --> 01:09:51,219
getting you know once they start to

1410
01:09:47,770 --> 01:09:54,279
understand the balance more and how some

1411
01:09:51,219 --> 01:09:57,010
of those deficiencies or an excess

1412
01:09:54,279 --> 01:10:00,210
caused by an excess then that really

1413
01:09:57,010 --> 01:10:04,710
helps to balance things out you know

1414
01:10:00,210 --> 01:10:07,179
rather than thinking oh I got a you know

1415
01:10:04,710 --> 01:10:11,590
magnesium deficiency and keep applying

1416
01:10:07,179 --> 01:10:14,949
the soil the magnesium raises the pH 1.6

1417
01:10:11,590 --> 01:10:17,590
times more than the other cations and it

1418
01:10:14,948 --> 01:10:21,519
really takes a long time to correct

1419
01:10:17,590 --> 01:10:25,440
itself so a lot of times we already got

1420
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:29,440
plenty of magnesium so applying more

1421
01:10:25,439 --> 01:10:31,689
isn't the best case doing a foliar spray

1422
01:10:29,439 --> 01:10:33,549
can correct your magnesium deficiency

1423
01:10:31,689 --> 01:10:37,750
and then bringing your sodium and

1424
01:10:33,550 --> 01:10:40,690
potassium down because usually it's it's

1425
01:10:37,750 --> 01:10:43,260
one of those being high that's why

1426
01:10:40,689 --> 01:10:47,099
there's a magnesium deficiency or

1427
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:50,139
someone really overdid the calcium and

1428
01:10:47,100 --> 01:10:55,239
that can cause your magnesium deficiency

1429
01:10:50,139 --> 01:10:58,539
to occasionally it's low but most of the

1430
01:10:55,238 --> 01:11:03,218
time hundreds of tests I see it's

1431
01:10:58,539 --> 01:11:06,310
usually high look at Kate Moss it's 12%

1432
01:11:03,219 --> 01:11:11,020
out the back of magnesium so it's

1433
01:11:06,310 --> 01:11:14,620
already got a good amount so for someone

1434
01:11:11,020 --> 01:11:17,199
that wants to learn more about soil

1435
01:11:14,619 --> 01:11:18,340
testing and mineral balancing a lot of

1436
01:11:17,198 --> 01:11:19,960
the concepts that we've talked about

1437
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:22,440
today are there any books

1438
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:26,260
resources that you'd like to mention oh

1439
01:11:22,439 --> 01:11:31,019
yes the you know Steve Solomon's book

1440
01:11:26,260 --> 01:11:35,110
the intelligent gardener is good

1441
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:37,420
hands-on agronomy by Neil Kinsey it's

1442
01:11:35,109 --> 01:11:40,449
really good he was a student of Albrecht

1443
01:11:37,420 --> 01:11:43,149
and he's been doing this for years and

1444
01:11:40,449 --> 01:11:45,399
applying the field and sharing the

1445
01:11:43,149 --> 01:11:48,539
results he's getting that was a really

1446
01:11:45,399 --> 01:11:54,009
good book too

1447
01:11:48,539 --> 01:11:59,140
the ideal soil it is good but that book

1448
01:11:54,010 --> 01:12:03,280
ignores max application rates so that's

1449
01:11:59,140 --> 01:12:05,680
why it gives you more information but I

1450
01:12:03,279 --> 01:12:08,920
prefer Solomon's book and can see

1451
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:14,850
because they both talk about max

1452
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:21,699
application rates and you know how

1453
01:12:14,850 --> 01:12:25,000
that's important so some some cases you

1454
01:12:21,699 --> 01:12:28,059
know people ignore those max rates and

1455
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:30,460
I've seen it caused problems and so I'd

1456
01:12:28,060 --> 01:12:32,260
rather play it safe and deal with

1457
01:12:30,460 --> 01:12:36,489
something that's shown to work and then

1458
01:12:32,260 --> 01:12:38,590
I don't see people have problems if they

1459
01:12:36,488 --> 01:12:44,199
just you know go slow and build the soil

1460
01:12:38,590 --> 01:12:48,550
in time rather than overdoing it and

1461
01:12:44,199 --> 01:12:52,109
there's also a book more loot from soil

1462
01:12:48,550 --> 01:12:54,989
science it's an older book and it's a

1463
01:12:52,109 --> 01:12:58,949
you know it talks about just testing

1464
01:12:54,988 --> 01:13:01,689
using higher levels of calcium and so

1465
01:12:58,949 --> 01:13:03,939
we've got a consider well what were they

1466
01:13:01,689 --> 01:13:06,729
testing at that time where they using a

1467
01:13:03,939 --> 01:13:10,419
male at three and now that we have the a

1468
01:13:06,729 --> 01:13:12,819
a point to and learn more that I feel

1469
01:13:10,420 --> 01:13:15,000
hey we could maybe push calcium a little

1470
01:13:12,819 --> 01:13:17,859
higher seventy to seventy-five percent

1471
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:20,020
but throwing higher isn't always the

1472
01:13:17,859 --> 01:13:23,109
best case because as we make that

1473
01:13:20,020 --> 01:13:26,980
calcium available in time it can cause

1474
01:13:23,109 --> 01:13:29,889
more problems because I seen us do a

1475
01:13:26,979 --> 01:13:33,339
series of tests and you do a standard

1476
01:13:29,890 --> 01:13:33,760
test and then a pace test and so then

1477
01:13:33,340 --> 01:13:36,250
apply

1478
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:38,710
more calcium and then do the standard

1479
01:13:36,250 --> 01:13:41,050
and do the base test taste test again

1480
01:13:38,710 --> 01:13:44,019
and see the calcium availability

1481
01:13:41,050 --> 01:13:46,719
improves so I had a customer he thought

1482
01:13:44,019 --> 01:13:49,840
okay I need to apply twelve thousand

1483
01:13:46,719 --> 01:13:52,538
pounds an acre of calcium to get my

1484
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:56,828
taste test looking good and so it put

1485
01:13:52,538 --> 01:13:59,469
his soil at 85 percent calcium and by

1486
01:13:56,828 --> 01:14:01,738
the end of his planted good but by the

1487
01:13:59,469 --> 01:14:04,569
end of the first run and he replanted

1488
01:14:01,738 --> 01:14:08,768
everything was yellowing the pH was

1489
01:14:04,569 --> 01:14:11,229
seven five and above and then it was it

1490
01:14:08,769 --> 01:14:14,260
was just no potassium he cost a lot of

1491
01:14:11,229 --> 01:14:18,218
problems by not accounting and there was

1492
01:14:14,260 --> 01:14:21,190
such a large amount of free calcium that

1493
01:14:18,219 --> 01:14:24,309
cost problems so I found in seeing that

1494
01:14:21,189 --> 01:14:26,229
it was helpful to know okay we can spoon

1495
01:14:24,309 --> 01:14:28,269
feed a little bit of calcium and help

1496
01:14:26,229 --> 01:14:30,428
make it more available but we don't

1497
01:14:28,269 --> 01:14:35,949
necessarily have to hammer it all the

1498
01:14:30,429 --> 01:14:37,868
way up to 85 percent and so this in the

1499
01:14:35,948 --> 01:14:40,238
book more food some soil science he

1500
01:14:37,868 --> 01:14:42,488
preaches that because he's testing

1501
01:14:40,238 --> 01:14:47,468
things and in ninety percent of the time

1502
01:14:42,488 --> 01:14:50,529
nor calcium improved the situation and

1503
01:14:47,469 --> 01:14:52,889
so that that's very crude but we got to

1504
01:14:50,529 --> 01:14:55,868
be smart about it and just not go

1505
01:14:52,889 --> 01:14:58,840
willy-nilly on calcium and ignore

1506
01:14:55,868 --> 01:15:01,299
everything else because I've seen some

1507
01:14:58,840 --> 01:15:04,809
people that and realize the importance

1508
01:15:01,300 --> 01:15:08,288
of that and then they're they're they're

1509
01:15:04,809 --> 01:15:11,769
getting to empathizing the calcium so

1510
01:15:08,288 --> 01:15:14,288
much to not think about balance yeah I

1511
01:15:11,769 --> 01:15:15,789
would add within this world of mineral

1512
01:15:14,288 --> 01:15:17,469
balancing or so about saying there's

1513
01:15:15,788 --> 01:15:19,960
quite a few experts that have very

1514
01:15:17,469 --> 01:15:21,550
different beliefs and I think and I may

1515
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:23,170
be mispronouncing his name I've always

1516
01:15:21,550 --> 01:15:25,239
said tangents is one of the ones that

1517
01:15:23,170 --> 01:15:27,730
tends to go with higher calcium I think

1518
01:15:25,238 --> 01:15:30,459
Arden Anderson is another one as well if

1519
01:15:27,729 --> 01:15:33,488
I remember correctly but what I suggest

1520
01:15:30,460 --> 01:15:38,368
yeah Keegan's teachings Arden Anderson's

1521
01:15:33,488 --> 01:15:42,638
more in the make it available applied

1522
01:15:38,368 --> 01:15:45,009
beach well the toe bolts and work on it

1523
01:15:42,639 --> 01:15:47,469
like a different mode of action the way

1524
01:15:45,010 --> 01:15:49,840
he explains is imagine

1525
01:15:47,469 --> 01:15:52,658
your top base calcium in your soil is

1526
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:56,069
like a charcoal briquette and then a

1527
01:15:52,658 --> 01:15:59,138
little bit of liquid b12 or calcium

1528
01:15:56,069 --> 01:16:01,359
applied to that charcoal is like the

1529
01:15:59,139 --> 01:16:03,699
lighter fluid that ignites calcium

1530
01:16:01,359 --> 01:16:08,259
availability and that's what harden

1531
01:16:03,698 --> 01:16:10,149
anderson teaches versus Cajuns was more

1532
01:16:08,260 --> 01:16:12,039
like Guinea pigging okay let's

1533
01:16:10,149 --> 01:16:15,009
experiment and figure these things out

1534
01:16:12,038 --> 01:16:18,639
and test higher higher but then I think

1535
01:16:15,010 --> 01:16:22,869
my point was and once I started test and

1536
01:16:18,639 --> 01:16:26,859
look and calculate the T C with a 8.2

1537
01:16:22,868 --> 01:16:29,738
and the male x3 I was seeing 70 to 75

1538
01:16:26,859 --> 01:16:33,219
percent was right the same as that 85 on

1539
01:16:29,738 --> 01:16:35,948
a mailing tree and so by balancing it

1540
01:16:33,219 --> 01:16:37,420
more we can get because I was seeing a

1541
01:16:35,948 --> 01:16:40,748
lot of people they look at their pace

1542
01:16:37,420 --> 01:16:44,170
test and they can't get that 60 percent

1543
01:16:40,748 --> 01:16:47,219
available calcium so they were trying to

1544
01:16:44,170 --> 01:16:50,590
hammer it higher and higher to force it

1545
01:16:47,219 --> 01:16:53,679
first down the magnesium the potassium

1546
01:16:50,590 --> 01:16:57,819
and sodium because there's that rule of

1547
01:16:53,679 --> 01:17:00,429
cation displacement you know add more

1548
01:16:57,819 --> 01:17:02,889
calcium as that from soft it will lower

1549
01:17:00,429 --> 01:17:04,779
the magnesium the staff bumps off it

1550
01:17:02,889 --> 01:17:07,449
will lower the potassium as that bounce

1551
01:17:04,779 --> 01:17:09,998
off it lowers the sodium as long as

1552
01:17:07,448 --> 01:17:13,558
she's got that solution and the runoff

1553
01:17:09,998 --> 01:17:16,809
you know you're getting that drainage

1554
01:17:13,559 --> 01:17:19,329
yeah I would just remind listeners that

1555
01:17:16,809 --> 01:17:21,400
they can always test these things so the

1556
01:17:19,328 --> 01:17:25,328
best thing to do would be to set aside

1557
01:17:21,399 --> 01:17:27,670
you know one area and set up a trial you

1558
01:17:25,328 --> 01:17:30,099
know use scientific method control for a

1559
01:17:27,670 --> 01:17:32,319
variable and and test out what works out

1560
01:17:30,099 --> 01:17:34,210
best for you with any of the you know

1561
01:17:32,319 --> 01:17:36,698
any of the podcast guests I have on here

1562
01:17:34,210 --> 01:17:38,979
it's just an opportunity to experiment

1563
01:17:36,698 --> 01:17:40,808
but experiment in a way that has

1564
01:17:38,979 --> 01:17:43,479
scientific control so you can actually

1565
01:17:40,809 --> 01:17:49,420
determine what the controlling factor is

1566
01:17:43,479 --> 01:17:51,070
in your results yes yes that's great

1567
01:17:49,420 --> 01:17:54,219
because it's going to vary a little bit

1568
01:17:51,069 --> 01:17:56,198
for everybody and what pulse of are

1569
01:17:54,219 --> 01:17:59,050
they're growing and what type of

1570
01:17:56,198 --> 01:18:01,389
environment they're in that's always

1571
01:17:59,050 --> 01:18:02,860
going to be the best plan and when I

1572
01:18:01,390 --> 01:18:05,260
working with someone new and they're

1573
01:18:02,859 --> 01:18:07,299
maybe trying to switch from more of a

1574
01:18:05,260 --> 01:18:10,720
conventional style to doing the more of

1575
01:18:07,300 --> 01:18:13,270
a you know biological or organic system

1576
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:15,880
of growing all have them try just a

1577
01:18:13,270 --> 01:18:18,850
light or thing and see that that works

1578
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:22,449
for them and then switch it over you

1579
01:18:18,850 --> 01:18:24,550
know because everyone's different and

1580
01:18:22,449 --> 01:18:28,449
then you could see you know what works

1581
01:18:24,550 --> 01:18:30,070
for them you know some people like in

1582
01:18:28,449 --> 01:18:32,920
order used to doing things a certain way

1583
01:18:30,069 --> 01:18:36,609
and they're used to using a bunch of

1584
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:39,010
different bottled nutrients and they

1585
01:18:36,609 --> 01:18:41,469
look at those as tools and instead can

1586
01:18:39,010 --> 01:18:45,159
say look here's here's the same tools

1587
01:18:41,470 --> 01:18:47,110
we're just making a stock solution or

1588
01:18:45,159 --> 01:18:49,449
we're using these dry amendments and

1589
01:18:47,109 --> 01:18:51,309
that's the equivalence of that and once

1590
01:18:49,449 --> 01:18:55,269
people understand that and they they

1591
01:18:51,310 --> 01:18:57,730
feel more comfortable you know and

1592
01:18:55,270 --> 01:19:01,180
knowing what to apply and how much and

1593
01:18:57,729 --> 01:19:02,889
then seeing the response yeah well I

1594
01:19:01,180 --> 01:19:04,930
really appreciate you taking the time

1595
