1
00:00:03,138 --> 00:00:08,419
I want to talk about the hem press it

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:11,509
might I think another one that I've been

3
00:00:08,419 --> 00:00:14,030
seeing a lot of with people it's pretty

4
00:00:11,509 --> 00:00:16,940
easy to identify I think relative to

5
00:00:14,029 --> 00:00:18,469
other other issues and other mites but

6
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:22,340
can you talk a little bit about it in

7
00:00:18,469 --> 00:00:26,359
general well yes and no because again

8
00:00:22,339 --> 00:00:27,820
there's still a lot we don't know I do

9
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:30,649
think there's a lot of bad information

10
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:32,719
they do not live in the vascular tissue

11
00:00:30,649 --> 00:00:36,949
of the plants they're not inserting

12
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:41,179
their eggs into the vascular tissue you

13
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:42,710
know that again it's it's um it's

14
00:00:41,179 --> 00:00:44,960
important to be getting good information

15
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:46,520
but the problem is is people the first

16
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,219
thing they do is they go to the Internet

17
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:51,140
and unfortunately there's you know a lot

18
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:53,810
of bad information on every subject out

19
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:56,480
there I think those are some of the

20
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:58,550
biggest misconceptions how do you get it

21
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:00,619
you generally have done it to yourself

22
00:00:58,549 --> 00:01:03,589
because you brought it in on plant

23
00:01:00,619 --> 00:01:05,750
material or possibly your clothing I've

24
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:07,760
been in enough cannabis facilities that

25
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:09,978
you know as you're walking down the

26
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:13,070
aisle your shoulders are brushing up

27
00:01:09,978 --> 00:01:16,959
against the cannabis plants and you're

28
00:01:13,069 --> 00:01:20,209
just acting as a giant vector spreading

29
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:21,949
then the mites or even insects down the

30
00:01:20,209 --> 00:01:24,019
rows and you know you want to be able to

31
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:25,909
walk through a facility without dragging

32
00:01:24,019 --> 00:01:29,000
your shoulders because even even if you

33
00:01:25,909 --> 00:01:30,350
put on lab coat or a tie back suit or

34
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,478
anything and then you go out to the

35
00:01:30,349 --> 00:01:34,640
lobby you take it off you still could

36
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:36,650
have insects on your skin and you know I

37
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,868
you need to be wearing a hairnet you

38
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:41,478
know but still you can spread things

39
00:01:38,868 --> 00:01:42,859
around that way and and basically the

40
00:01:41,478 --> 00:01:44,840
hem for us it might is a completely

41
00:01:42,859 --> 00:01:48,039
self-induced problem because of poor

42
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:50,900
sanitation in the cannabis industry nuts

43
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:52,880
so we're not getting hemp Russert from

44
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:55,880
the outdoors it's coming plant to plant

45
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:57,920
transmission well if you are next door

46
00:01:55,879 --> 00:02:00,019
to a hemp field that has it it could

47
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,478
theoretically blow in but you know back

48
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:04,219
to this whole the government's releasing

49
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:06,409
it out of the back of vans driving down

50
00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:09,019
the roads you know that is just it's all

51
00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:11,330
conspiracy series conspiracy theory

52
00:02:09,019 --> 00:02:14,959
stuff and that the the other area

53
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:17,330
Fayed's they're using for weed

54
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,659
management it's not even close to the

55
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:21,320
same

56
00:02:17,659 --> 00:02:22,759
species so that's not it's it's nobody

57
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:24,169
wants to take responsibility that

58
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:26,060
they've done it to themselves but that's

59
00:02:24,169 --> 00:02:27,739
exactly what's happened with the

60
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:29,120
cannabis eat because the cannabis see if

61
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:31,730
it has now Albin down the eastern

62
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,280
seaboard how'd it get here through plant

63
00:02:31,729 --> 00:02:37,699
movement it didn't fly over here from

64
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:40,250
California it didn't ride over on grapes

65
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:43,039
it didn't ride over on strawberries it

66
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:44,479
came on cannabis plant material and it's

67
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:47,389
the same thing with a hemp for us at my

68
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:48,979
poor sanitation practices I would say

69
00:02:47,389 --> 00:02:50,869
that when I'm consulting we probably

70
00:02:48,979 --> 00:02:53,030
spend seventy seventy-five percent of

71
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:56,210
our time dealing with just sanitation

72
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:57,439
and production facilities these days so

73
00:02:56,210 --> 00:03:01,400
what are some good identifying

74
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:02,750
characteristics of impressive when you

75
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,640
see it again you need super high

76
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:08,210
magnification it's basically shaped like

77
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:10,250
a carrot where the broad might so much

78
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:13,460
more like jellybean kind of shaped these

79
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:16,310
are more shaped like a carrot so that's

80
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:18,890
one of the easiest ways to see it and

81
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:22,640
they're kind of creamy colored doesn't

82
00:03:18,889 --> 00:03:25,458
have multiple stages of growth yeah well

83
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:28,099
I mean it's just like like spider mites

84
00:03:25,459 --> 00:03:29,659
and just like broad mites and when they

85
00:03:28,099 --> 00:03:31,009
first hatch out they're real tiny and

86
00:03:29,659 --> 00:03:34,159
each time they molt they just get a

87
00:03:31,009 --> 00:03:35,810
little bigger but again you know if you

88
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,310
see a carrot with a couple hairs of the

89
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:39,890
front end that's their legs I mean it

90
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:42,110
was just no mistaking it in cannabis

91
00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:44,449
that's the only thing that looks like

92
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:46,790
that so far that we've seen in cannabis

93
00:03:44,449 --> 00:03:48,319
with all this hemp going in outside who

94
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:49,849
knows what we're gonna see cuz we're

95
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,889
starting to see all kinds of new pests

96
00:03:49,849 --> 00:03:53,659
in the outdoor hemp production and that

97
00:03:51,889 --> 00:03:57,769
may end up eventually in some of the

98
00:03:53,659 --> 00:04:01,009
indoor grows but for right now again

99
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:03,080
July 11th 2019 you see something looks

100
00:04:01,009 --> 00:04:06,019
like a carrot it's pretty much gonna be

101
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:09,530
a hip recipe unless it's a lot bigger

102
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:11,900
and is a ladybug larva Oh a lot bigger

103
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:14,479
and looks completely different hey I've

104
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:17,060
seen that confused so I know I've had

105
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:20,509
trips and Russert mites confused and

106
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:21,879
yeah so with the hemp press it what sort

107
00:04:20,509 --> 00:04:25,129
of treatment options do we have

108
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:26,719
once we fluently spotted it yeah well

109
00:04:25,129 --> 00:04:29,060
first up again smack yourself in the

110
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,860
back of the head for bringing it in and

111
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:37,139
then after you do that

112
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:38,310
there's not a lot with you know and

113
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:40,168
we've talked about this briefly before

114
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:42,000
and some of the stuff I had higher hopes

115
00:04:40,168 --> 00:04:44,430
I think for a lot of the predatory mites

116
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,810
I do not have a lot of confidence in the

117
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:51,658
predatory mites to manage it at this

118
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:55,019
point I think that under Sony as a

119
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:56,788
prevention still has some something

120
00:04:55,019 --> 00:04:57,719
there but once you have a population

121
00:04:56,788 --> 00:04:59,639
again

122
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,990
spraying soaps or oils I think are your

123
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:03,629
best options and you've got to get

124
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:05,069
really really good spray coverage I mean

125
00:05:03,629 --> 00:05:07,650
that's what it comes down to is good

126
00:05:05,069 --> 00:05:10,889
spray technique with good equipment not

127
00:05:07,649 --> 00:05:12,598
paint sprayers spray equipment design

128
00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:16,319
for applying pesticides

129
00:05:12,598 --> 00:05:19,139
well the soil ex work as well yes it

130
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:21,210
works amazing again there's been some

131
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:24,930
work going on and somebody else is doing

132
00:05:21,209 --> 00:05:27,060
it and I'm not gonna I'm gonna wait for

133
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:29,490
him to put all that stuff out but this

134
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:33,089
uh file did really well in his trials on

135
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:34,769
the impress it might extremely well now

136
00:05:33,089 --> 00:05:37,109
I know some of these have a lifecycle of

137
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:39,389
a certain number of days or weeks how

138
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:41,370
many applications are sprays do we need

139
00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:43,528
to be doing to really control any of

140
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:45,930
these insects we're talking well it's

141
00:05:43,528 --> 00:05:48,060
all about spray coverage and that's the

142
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:52,199
thing and also with the eggs

143
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:55,259
so eggs oils kill eggs better than soaps

144
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:57,060
do typically you know there's always

145
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:59,218
exceptions but for the most part but

146
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:01,168
with eggs since they respirate so low

147
00:05:59,218 --> 00:06:02,459
when you spray oil on it I used to

148
00:06:01,168 --> 00:06:04,318
suffocate but if you have a very route

149
00:06:02,459 --> 00:06:06,750
low respiration rate it's hard to

150
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:10,039
suffocate them but I know Cornell's done

151
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:13,228
a lot of work on Dan Gill ran looking at

152
00:06:10,038 --> 00:06:14,968
oils and using them for a two spot

153
00:06:13,228 --> 00:06:17,430
spider mites eggs and he said it works

154
00:06:14,968 --> 00:06:19,709
extremely well the empress at my eight

155
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:21,300
eggs are so small and trans fat and not

156
00:06:19,709 --> 00:06:24,689
transparent in their respirating very

157
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:28,918
low so they need multiple applications

158
00:06:24,689 --> 00:06:31,348
of oil so you've got to look at your

159
00:06:28,918 --> 00:06:33,028
temperatures you've got to look at your

160
00:06:31,348 --> 00:06:36,180
plants stressed you got to be really

161
00:06:33,028 --> 00:06:39,000
careful also you know sulfur and oil bad

162
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:41,560
bad bad bad idea I'm not a fan of using

163
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:46,509
sulfur if

164
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:50,139
sulfur will if used properly you can

165
00:06:46,509 --> 00:06:51,789
really knock back and press it might I'm

166
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:53,469
concerned about all the software being

167
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:55,810
used because of resistance issues

168
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:57,580
potentially and also you've kind of

169
00:06:55,810 --> 00:07:01,839
excluded yourself from using beneficials

170
00:06:57,579 --> 00:07:05,500
at this point and also I had one of my

171
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:07,000
growers who was using sulfur and they

172
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,500
tested positive for arsenic and they

173
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,180
went and they tested the sulfur and that

174
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:12,029
seemed to be the source of arsenic was

175
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:15,280
in the sulfur product they were spraying

176
00:07:12,029 --> 00:07:17,319
though yeah well I got a remember if

177
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:18,849
it's being used in on tomatoes and

178
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:20,409
things like that they're not heavy metal

179
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:21,669
accumulators so no one's ever had to

180
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:23,740
worry about testing that stuff before

181
00:07:21,668 --> 00:07:25,539
and I'm not saying you know that all

182
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:28,269
software has arsenic don't you know in

183
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:32,590
this particular situation this is was

184
00:07:28,269 --> 00:07:34,149
was their source so so I'm just I'm not

185
00:07:32,589 --> 00:07:36,519
gonna say I would never recommend it but

186
00:07:34,149 --> 00:07:39,069
I generally don't recommend it and I

187
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:40,569
think you're a lot safer for resistance

188
00:07:39,069 --> 00:07:45,069
issues because it's gonna be really hard

189
00:07:40,569 --> 00:07:45,728
to build resistance to oils cost wise so

190
00:07:45,069 --> 00:07:48,250
foil acts

191
00:07:45,728 --> 00:07:50,439
I think about 2 and 1/2 gallon jug is

192
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:53,290
like 60 bucks and you mix it up at like

193
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:56,889
a 1% so you're gonna make 250 gallons of

194
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:58,720
solution for $60 I mean the price is

195
00:07:56,889 --> 00:08:00,668
there it's unrealistic so it's approved

196
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,229
for use in organic production I'm not

197
00:08:00,668 --> 00:08:03,789
saying you can't use other oils it's

198
00:08:02,228 --> 00:08:08,680
just I've worked for this oil for like

199
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:10,860
25 years so I have a good comfort with

200
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:14,139
it I mean that's that you know basically

201
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:16,389
what it is I haven't had Fido once it's

202
00:08:14,139 --> 00:08:18,279
dry we can rerelease the beneficials but

203
00:08:16,389 --> 00:08:20,918
you probably are gonna have to do a few

204
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:22,779
sprays back-to-back because you have to

205
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:23,829
get really good spray coverage and even

206
00:08:22,779 --> 00:08:25,569
though you think you get a hundred

207
00:08:23,829 --> 00:08:27,159
percent spray coverage you're not and

208
00:08:25,569 --> 00:08:30,279
that's why if you do it again

209
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:32,019
you know you're gonna get more coverage

210
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:33,610
it's just like you know you paint a wall

211
00:08:32,019 --> 00:08:35,139
a different color and you think you got

212
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:36,519
it then next day and you go by you see

213
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:38,319
spots that are really thin where the

214
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:39,939
paint wasn't thick enough that's why

215
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:44,410
going back and putting a second coat on

216
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:46,150
will make sure are you talking like the

217
00:08:44,409 --> 00:08:47,350
next day or wait you know I'd give it a

218
00:08:46,149 --> 00:08:49,299
couple days in between cuz you don't

219
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:52,570
want to just coat your plants in oil

220
00:08:49,299 --> 00:08:54,189
either yeah okay now what about bringing

221
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:54,950
a plant into the facility let's say in a

222
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:56,030
plan

223
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:58,490
that you're bringing in you're like well

224
00:08:56,029 --> 00:09:00,199
it could have hem press it might or it

225
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:02,889
could have any of the other pests we

226
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:06,050
talked about what would be your sort of

227
00:09:02,889 --> 00:09:08,149
procedure for treating you know dunking

228
00:09:06,049 --> 00:09:10,099
clones or cleaning up whatever it is

229
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:11,720
you're bringing it well oh you need to

230
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,279
have a quarantine area and this is the

231
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,779
problem I'm even seeing new facilities

232
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:18,470
being built that don't have quarantine

233
00:09:14,779 --> 00:09:20,179
areas they just the the growing areas

234
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:26,330
aren't isolated enough so problems just

235
00:09:20,179 --> 00:09:29,839
get spread around with dipping of plants

236
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:34,970
now you never any kind of oil products

237
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:37,730
you do not want to dip the roots in you

238
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:39,769
know the oils are better for the foliage

239
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:42,740
sorry my cats just jumping up he

240
00:09:39,769 --> 00:09:46,909
bloopers sorry it's fine you coming for

241
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:48,529
his afternoon pets you never want to dip

242
00:09:46,909 --> 00:09:54,740
roots and oils and you never want to

243
00:09:48,529 --> 00:09:57,559
drench with oils you can you can use

244
00:09:54,740 --> 00:10:02,509
products like the microbials are safe

245
00:09:57,559 --> 00:10:04,039
for roots the Bavaria's the areas and

246
00:10:02,509 --> 00:10:05,960
things like that but remember those

247
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:08,959
really don't treat for mines especially

248
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:10,370
hemp for us at night up in Canada

249
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:14,629
they've done a lot of research with

250
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:16,549
dipping cuttings for mums and for

251
00:10:14,629 --> 00:10:19,840
poinsettias and things like that and in

252
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:23,629
their research in Canada they found that

253
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:26,930
dipping and a 0.1% oil solution of

254
00:10:23,629 --> 00:10:31,700
foliage not the roots was a very good

255
00:10:26,929 --> 00:10:33,139
dip rate for dipping these plants and

256
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,430
that way you do get a hundred percent

257
00:10:33,139 --> 00:10:36,830
coverage and that's why when people

258
00:10:34,429 --> 00:10:38,539
often take cuttings are doing this it's

259
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:40,520
still and I mean this has been going on

260
00:10:38,539 --> 00:10:42,860
for years there's still this they're

261
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:45,949
trying to get it actually on the label

262
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:49,399
to say that and so it's technically not

263
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:51,259
on the label yet but it's the research

264
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:54,409
shows it works very well for a lot of

265
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:56,389
key pests and it has a very good level

266
00:10:54,409 --> 00:10:57,769
of plant safety and you get a 100%

267
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:59,059
coverage because a lot of people like

268
00:10:57,769 --> 00:11:00,740
well we can just stick them and spray

269
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:02,509
them but then you're not necessarily

270
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:06,379
going to get a hundred percent spray

271
00:11:02,509 --> 00:11:07,970
coverage so it's it's kind of a tricky

272
00:11:06,379 --> 00:11:08,889
situation there and we're waiting for

273
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:12,489
this

274
00:11:08,889 --> 00:11:16,539
dip label but cannabis isn't on the

275
00:11:12,489 --> 00:11:17,709
label either yes be because of the laws

276
00:11:16,539 --> 00:11:21,399
with the EPA and things around

277
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:24,159
pesticides you can't recommend a dip

278
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:26,168
rate you can talk about the research

279
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:28,269
that exists in Canada but you can't make

280
00:11:26,168 --> 00:11:30,009
that recommendation because of the rules

281
00:11:28,269 --> 00:11:31,058
or regulations around and and some oil

282
00:11:30,009 --> 00:11:34,869
acts can't make that recommendation

283
00:11:31,058 --> 00:11:37,259
either direct use so I just write yeah

284
00:11:34,869 --> 00:11:39,819
that's why there's all this dancing

285
00:11:37,259 --> 00:11:42,278
around about it but according to

286
00:11:39,818 --> 00:11:46,328
research a very good dip rate is zero

287
00:11:42,278 --> 00:11:47,619
point one percent for supplamine dip

288
00:11:46,328 --> 00:11:50,229
rates for other products and that's

289
00:11:47,619 --> 00:11:51,699
you've got a this is what's good about

290
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:54,579
the software product is that got

291
00:11:51,698 --> 00:11:57,128
research to back the stuff up it's been

292
00:11:54,578 --> 00:12:00,778
trialed it's been tested and you know I

293
00:11:57,129 --> 00:12:03,489
see a lot of claims from products and

294
00:12:00,778 --> 00:12:05,528
okay you make this claim you say your

295
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:07,899
product annihilates him for us it might

296
00:12:05,528 --> 00:12:09,970
where's a single trial you know it

297
00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:11,379
annihilates spider mites okay that's

298
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:13,449
something a university could have done

299
00:12:11,379 --> 00:12:16,749
or a third party or something where is

300
00:12:13,448 --> 00:12:19,808
any any research on it and and it's just

301
00:12:16,749 --> 00:12:21,278
not there and and it's tough to know

302
00:12:19,808 --> 00:12:26,948
what to believe and what not to believe

303
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:31,110
yeah yeah so I I know I said that was

304
00:12:26,948 --> 00:12:31,109
the last one I think I have one more

305
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:38,168
I have blue first I have I have an easy

306
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:39,100
one for you I think just in the sense

307
00:12:38,168 --> 00:12:41,188
that I think I know what you're already

308
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:43,659
gonna say cuz we've talked about it but

309
00:12:41,188 --> 00:12:49,088
plant parasitic nematodes like the

310
00:12:43,659 --> 00:12:53,469
root-knot nematode what what options do

311
00:12:49,089 --> 00:12:57,220
we have there none flamethrowers Burnham

312
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:59,829
this is my same thing in don't get them

313
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:02,048
I mean that's again they're not flying

314
00:12:59,828 --> 00:13:05,409
in they're not walking in you brought

315
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:07,538
them into your facility now if you are

316
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:09,129
in the south because the Southeast

317
00:13:07,538 --> 00:13:11,678
United States has a lot of root-knot

318
00:13:09,129 --> 00:13:13,600
nematode and you're growing your plants

319
00:13:11,678 --> 00:13:15,249
outdoors in the ground well that's not

320
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,439
your fault but when you get it in an

321
00:13:15,249 --> 00:13:19,869
indoor grow or in raised beds you

322
00:13:17,438 --> 00:13:21,578
brought it in I had somebody recently

323
00:13:19,869 --> 00:13:22,250
contact me and they literally went

324
00:13:21,578 --> 00:13:25,399
outside

325
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:29,059
and they just were scooping up soil

326
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:30,949
outside to inoculate indoors and it's a

327
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:32,689
total crapshoot you could bring in some

328
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:36,470
good stuff you can bring in a lot of bad

329
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:39,950
stuff too and that's that's the the risk

330
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:42,500
you take with doing things like that now

331
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:46,330
the University of Florida is putting in

332
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:49,759
12 hemp trial sites this year down

333
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:51,259
obviously in Florida under various soil

334
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:53,090
conditions and it's gonna be very

335
00:13:51,259 --> 00:13:54,889
interesting to see and they actually do

336
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:57,620
have one of their new mythologists

337
00:13:54,889 --> 00:13:59,439
working with them on this to see you

338
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:05,529
know what nematodes are picked up and

339
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:08,360
what becomes a problem for them but

340
00:14:05,529 --> 00:14:11,000
they've got this really weird situation

341
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:15,019
where they're not gonna be able to

342
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:19,279
publish their findings because of it

343
00:14:15,019 --> 00:14:20,899
being him so yeah it's kind of weird

344
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:23,179
they're not allowed to talk about any of

345
00:14:20,899 --> 00:14:26,629
the work they're doing at this point but

346
00:14:23,179 --> 00:14:32,599
that I'm hoping will give us more

347
00:14:26,629 --> 00:14:35,539
information on blimps on you know what

348
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:38,810
cuz we don't even know all the nematodes

349
00:14:35,539 --> 00:14:42,019
that cannabis can get at this point

350
00:14:38,809 --> 00:14:44,269
I keep getting reports of stem nematodes

351
00:14:42,019 --> 00:14:47,029
which I did have a grower that had some

352
00:14:44,269 --> 00:14:48,590
samples and I was so excited because one

353
00:14:47,029 --> 00:14:50,209
of the new Matala just agreed to look at

354
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:52,310
him to identify him and everything and

355
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:54,230
then I asked the grower to ship them and

356
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:56,989
then the girl just like went dark and

357
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:58,940
wouldn't respond to my phone calls or

358
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:00,830
anything I called over and over and over

359
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,790
again I guess they you know decided they

360
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:03,139
didn't want to be involved with that

361
00:15:01,789 --> 00:15:05,779
which I can kind of understand but at

362
00:15:03,139 --> 00:15:07,399
the same time you know until we can

363
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:08,720
figure out what we're really dealing

364
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:11,329
with you know it's gonna be harder to

365
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,009
manage it the pests I could probably get

366
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:15,410
you some root-knot nematodes know if

367
00:15:13,009 --> 00:15:17,809
these were stem nematodes you're not

368
00:15:15,409 --> 00:15:21,139
looking for root not know I we got

369
00:15:17,809 --> 00:15:23,569
plenty root nods around okay I haven't

370
00:15:21,139 --> 00:15:25,009
seen that one but one quite a couple

371
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:26,690
questions I did have around the root not

372
00:15:25,009 --> 00:15:28,370
nematode so just for people who are less

373
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:30,200
familiar with it I want to mention that

374
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:32,090
when I've seen it the plant just

375
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:34,580
literally just seems to stop growing and

376
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:35,930
then when you pull up the plant you get

377
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:37,820
these galls or

378
00:15:35,929 --> 00:15:39,620
not in the Ritz themselves they look

379
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:41,270
almost look like rhizomes that you would

380
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:44,330
see yeah

381
00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:46,129
you know unwelcome roots on the knot I

382
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:50,110
mean not knotted roots root-knot

383
00:15:46,129 --> 00:15:52,340
nematode and again it's not it's not

384
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:55,190
cannabis specific you know it's a big

385
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:56,990
problem on Tomatoes it's a problem I

386
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:58,880
think carrots get them there's several

387
00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:01,490
vegetables and that's why you know

388
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:03,500
people still methylbromide soils to kill

389
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:06,139
these plant parasitic nematodes because

390
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:08,750
they are so so hard to kill and that's

391
00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:10,610
why in states again like Florida if

392
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:12,289
you're gonna ship outside of the state

393
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:15,169
containers plant material you have to

394
00:16:12,289 --> 00:16:17,000
grow up on tables off the ground to

395
00:16:15,169 --> 00:16:18,769
prevent nematodes from getting splashed

396
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,779
into your pots so that's what there's an

397
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:23,899
actual measured height that they grow at

398
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:27,789
because water splashing can spread plant

399
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:31,840
parasitic nematodes now one thing that

400
00:16:27,789 --> 00:16:34,849
my friend tried was heating their room

401
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:36,560
for an indoor facility to raise the

402
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:38,840
temperature of the room they held it at

403
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:41,000
130 degrees for an hour I've heard the

404
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:43,160
research says you have to get up to 170

405
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,379
but if you're able to maintain the room

406
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:46,250
at a higher temperature for a period of

407
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:48,620
time like that

408
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:52,250
I know thermophilic compost that goes

409
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:54,470
off a lot of the pathogenic bacteria any

410
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:55,490
thoughts on that well what is that your

411
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:58,100
air temperature is that the temperature

412
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:59,090
in the middle of your soil bed well in

413
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,860
this case I'm sure it was air

414
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:02,660
temperature but yeah and so you know

415
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:04,338
it's not even be close to that inside of

416
00:17:02,659 --> 00:17:06,920
the soil in there so it's not and people

417
00:17:04,338 --> 00:17:07,759
ask me about heating room I just I don't

418
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:10,550
think it's gonna work

419
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:12,890
don't bring the root-knot nematodes in

420
00:17:10,549 --> 00:17:14,480
you're getting compost I think you

421
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:16,640
should test your compost for plant

422
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,900
parasitic nematodes you know this is

423
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,270
something that you know most

424
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:21,800
universities or in the state's you know

425
00:17:20,269 --> 00:17:24,170
you can just send a little baggie in and

426
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:25,569
have them do a test because to me it's

427
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:29,840
not worth the risk

428
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:33,200
yeah now one one speculation they had to

429
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:35,119
so they they have my friend has a space

430
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,890
that does have the root-knot nematode or

431
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:38,389
it did have it they tried cleaning the

432
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:41,480
room they tried all these different

433
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:43,130
products they were never able to remove

434
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:45,680
it but what they have been able to do is

435
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:48,560
sort of knock the population down right

436
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:49,789
to where they can make it two to three

437
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:52,339
cycles before

438
00:17:49,789 --> 00:17:54,409
it gets really bad again sort of thing

439
00:17:52,339 --> 00:17:57,879
so they've had a little bit of success

440
00:17:54,410 --> 00:18:01,040
and they they do bring in quite a bit of

441
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:03,830
the Steiner name of fealty a which I

442
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:05,509
probably didn't pronounce great enough

443
00:18:03,829 --> 00:18:07,009
and there was there any chance that

444
00:18:05,509 --> 00:18:08,869
those two could be competing for some

445
00:18:07,009 --> 00:18:11,869
sort of ecological niche in the soil at

446
00:18:08,869 --> 00:18:14,329
all are they just to toil and this is

447
00:18:11,869 --> 00:18:15,649
where people have taken liberties saying

448
00:18:14,329 --> 00:18:17,629
that the beneficial nematodes will

449
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:19,100
control plant parasitic nematodes I

450
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:20,480
talked to the woman that actually did

451
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:22,909
some of this work and this was at like a

452
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,620
Nimet ology meeting like 15 years ago

453
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:27,500
and she said what they found is in the

454
00:18:24,619 --> 00:18:28,939
petri dish if you put and I can't

455
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:31,279
remember which beneficial nematodes they

456
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:33,410
put in there and I'm pretty sure his

457
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:34,910
root not is they just kind of slightly

458
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:37,130
moved apart in the dish remember

459
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:40,400
nematodes don't travel far they're so

460
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:45,230
tiny and people took that as well it

461
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:48,170
controls it it's again if that if it

462
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:51,440
worked you would see all the big farms

463
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:53,029
doing it and we wouldn't be so using

464
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,730
methyl bromide I mean that's all I can

465
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:57,619
say is if something works people do it

466
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:58,150
and you don't see big farms doing it

467
00:18:57,619 --> 00:19:00,739
believe me

468
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:02,570
BASF they would love to be selling

469
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:04,009
nematodes for control a plant parasitic

470
00:19:02,569 --> 00:19:06,169
nematodes because they'd be selling

471
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:10,519
billions of them if that worked

472
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:12,740
they'd be doing it okay cool

473
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:13,970
well I would love to follow up another

474
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:15,680
time and talk a little bit we didn't

475
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:19,250
even get to like spider mites or thrips

476
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:22,279
or no we can't cover that much in a I

477
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:25,329
know I know but that was great I really

478
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:25,329
appreciate it that was fun
