podcast where we discuss the cutting

8
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:28,800
edge of growing from a science-based

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,240
perspective and drawing top experts from

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,679
around the industry to share their

11
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:34,399
wisdom and knowledge

12
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:36,159
my guest this week is lee brees lee is

13
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,000
an independent crop consultant from

14
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:40,479
central north dakota he provides

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,399
agronomic advice to help farmers build

16
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:44,718
customized systems to grow and manage

17
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,480
crops profitably he specializes in

18
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,800
helping farmers adopt practices to

19
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:50,799
protect and improve their soil and local

20
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:53,679
environment including reduced till

21
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:56,319
no-till cover crops crop rotation and

22
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:58,640
increased plant and economic diversity

23
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,920
now on to the show

24
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,310

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,118
hello

28
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,040
hey can we uh start off talking a little

29
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:09,118
bit about your background and uh sort of

30
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,439
what you do for a living

31
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:13,438
yeah sounds good so what i do for a

32
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:15,438
living is i'm a i'm an agricultural crop

33
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:18,000
consultant i actually work directly with

34
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:19,758
farmers to provide uh agricultural

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,879
advice and i tell everybody i'm a plant

36
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,640
doctor and i don't just mean that

37
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:24,879
metaphorically i actually went to school

38
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,000
and have that degree i have a doctor of

39
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:27,118
plant health from the university of

40
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,118
nebraska

41
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:30,959
but what i do is i work with farmers and

42
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:32,560
i go out and check their fields

43
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:34,239
and do regular checkups just like you

44
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,680
would think of it a doctor

45
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:36,719
and it's very similar to human beings

46
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,280
when they're small they need more

47
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:40,640
checkups and more more close attention

48
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,879
and as they get older they need a little

49
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,118
bit less attention so i do that so i

50
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:47,280
weekly check the farmers crops and look

51
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:49,200
for pests and diseases and problems and

52
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,560
environmental problems and all those

53
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,840
types of things and if we do find some

54
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,000
things that write prescriptions whether

55
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,000
they be fertility prescriptions or

56
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,239
practice prescriptions or whatever to

57
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,359
help them manage those situations and we

58
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:01,039
maintain it all the way through the

59
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:03,200
season

60
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,799
so you've probably seen a lot over the

61
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,600
years

62
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,439
how do you approach a given situation um

63
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:11,199
are there any you know critical things

64
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:12,800
that you look for when stepping onto a

65
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:15,280
new plot of land or we're starting to

66
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,520
work with a new farmer

67
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,239
yeah that's a great question i'm a very

68
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,800
visual and tactile oriented person and

69
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:25,439
so i really have to spend some time in

70
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,800
that production system and in that field

71
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:28,159
i actually like to spend a little bit of

72
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,640
alone time and then meet up with the

73
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:32,959
farmer later and talk about things what

74
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:34,799
i find is that my viewpoint is a little

75
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,719
bit different than the producers

76
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,480
and so i probably see things in a

77
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:40,318
different light in a different way and i

78
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:42,399
may find some things that are

79
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:43,919
challenging for them that may they may

80
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,239
have just assumed that it just is what

81
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:48,878
it is and they don't necessarily tackle

82
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:51,039
it or they may value a particular

83
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:52,959
problem more than another where i i may

84
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:54,639
value them differently so the the

85
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,519
combination of the producer and i

86
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:57,039
working together through these

87
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,599
situations seems to be very very

88
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:59,598
beneficial

89
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,598
you know i know there are a fair number

90
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,599
of consultants out there that will just

91
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:08,158
look at a

92
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:10,318
soil test or a biological test and make

93
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:11,679
their recommendations or determinations

94
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:13,919
around that

95
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,760
you know what percentage of

96
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:17,679
would you say

97
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:19,840
of your decision making is based off of

98
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,920
a test versus what you you know what you

99
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,959
see in the field and actually spending

100
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:25,359
that time

101
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,840
you know on site

102
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,799
while you ask hard questions okay so

103
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,878
um

104
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:33,439
yeah so the test is important it's an

105
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:35,359
actual measurement that you know we're

106
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:36,799
doing this but for me a soil test the

107
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,640
ones that i'm doing primarily are

108
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,480
straight up chemical analysis so we're

109
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:42,158
looking at fertility levels that's the

110
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:44,560
main thing that the test shows me so

111
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:46,079
that's that's important but the type of

112
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,840
soil and the lay of the land the

113
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,640
topography of it and all of that

114
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,120
influences how fertility moves and how

115
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:56,158
it's released a sandy soil versus a

116
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,840
higher clay soil or a steep slope versus

117
00:03:56,158 --> 00:03:59,679
a shallow

118
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,840
flat field those all make the

119
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,519
differences on how that nutrient is

120
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,759
going to be utilized and how it's going

121
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,120
to be available and so those types of

122
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:09,438
things are critically important i'm

123
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,360
going to say about 50 50. but there's

124
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:13,199
also a point where i've spent enough

125
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,680
time on the farm so in the beginning

126
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:18,319
it's 50 50 but i think once we get into

127
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,400
it i mean there's this continuous note

128
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:22,800
taking going on right every time i'm out

129
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:24,319
in this field i'm taking mental notes

130
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,240
and i'm taking actual physical notes

131
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:28,478
writing things down and as i do this

132
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,079
over time my things change a little bit

133
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:32,159
and so then i adapt them to that

134
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:33,918
specific thing so then yes the chemical

135
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,520
analysis is still important but it

136
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:36,478
becomes a little bit less important over

137
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:38,399
time

138
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:41,680
as we see how the things fit in that

139
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:44,319
particular field or position

140
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,000
um so you mentioned that you

141
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:47,040
you primarily use a chemical analysis

142
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,759
can we talk a little bit about

143
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,520
biological analysis um

144
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,120
absolutely

145
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:55,120
what experience do you have with that or

146
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,360
or what benefit if any do you see

147
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,759
associated with it because

148
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,840
that's a question we get a lot

149
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,360
yeah there's a lot of it out there

150
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:05,279
um

151
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,879
you know i think scientists tend to

152
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:09,279
overdo this this

153
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:10,959
their particular field is the greatest

154
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:12,559
place to discover new things and i'm no

155
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:13,918
different i'm a soil scientist i think

156
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,360
there's a great amount of things for us

157
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:17,758
to discover in soils we simply don't

158
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,960
know yet and i think biology is that big

159
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,280
reserve of

160
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:22,799
kind of this cloudy hazy thing that we

161
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,079
we kind of know some of the things that

162
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,759
are going on but we certainly don't know

163
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:27,120
everything that's going on

164
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,680
and the other thing that's difficult

165
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,360
with biology is that when we're talking

166
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,038
about things we're talking about entire

167
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,560
kingdoms the differences right we're

168
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:35,759
talking about bacteria we're talking

169
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,879
about archaea and they're talking about

170
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:41,280
fungi and that's the highest level of

171
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:42,478
organismal order and so we're talking

172
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:43,839
about huge differences and when you

173
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:46,319
think about bacteria you're talking

174
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:47,918
about things on hours minutes and days

175
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:49,759
and versus fungi you were talking about

176
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:50,799
days weeks and months

177
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,759
and so

178
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:57,360
those life cycles affect it so

179
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:59,199
my my caveat with biological analysis

180
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,639
is as much as when you're doing the

181
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,639
analysis

182
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,038
as what kind of analysis you're doing

183
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,560
and i think i don't have a problem with

184
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:08,240
analysis because i think they've been

185
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,079
well tested they've been there's

186
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,918
established protocols and all that kind

187
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:14,318
of thing but if you take a poor sample

188
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:16,240
or you take a sample at a timing that's

189
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,639
different for a specific

190
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,680
biological indicator you're going to get

191
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:24,160
wildly different things so for example a

192
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,319
cold soil versus a warm soil or

193
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,280
a wet soil versus a at the end of a

194
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,639
drought

195
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:30,478
you're going to see some very different

196
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,840
things because biology responds to all

197
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:33,839
of those things versus a chemical

198
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:35,279
analysis is pretty straightforward and

199
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:36,799
this is

200
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:39,679
you know it's going to be a similar

201
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,120
thing in both situations so i think

202
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,199
there's a lot of things there's there's

203
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,240
the co2 respiration

204
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:48,879
there is uh pflas which are actual you

205
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,240
know genetic testing looking for markers

206
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:51,598
and to see who's all in there and i

207
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,759
think these are really interesting

208
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:55,598
things to pursue

209
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,280
so we can do this we can find out who's

210
00:06:55,598 --> 00:06:59,038
in there at the time that you sampled

211
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:00,879
and under those conditions

212
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:03,120
but i don't know that we clearly

213
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:06,079
understand which ones we want to

214
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,439
cultivate or promote at any given point

215
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:10,560
in time yet we're not really sure what

216
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:12,560
their involvement is or how they work or

217
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,000
who's important who we want

218
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,360
you know if we're going to sort them to

219
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,720
the good guys and bad guys who's on

220
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,960
which team i don't think we're quite

221
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,880
there yet

222
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:23,359
yeah what i also hear you saying too is

223
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:26,478
it may not give you actionable

224
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,840
information in terms of um how you're

225
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:30,478
approaching your land i mean you could

226
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:33,918
say hey this soil should be more

227
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:35,918
biologically active you know even given

228
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:38,000
the fact that

229
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:39,839
you know it hasn't rained recently or

230
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,240
we're at this point in the season

231
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:45,758
but do you find that that really changes

232
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,519
the way you manage that soil i mean um

233
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,800
like for me my perspective is like i'm

234
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:51,918
going to be doing these things to

235
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,879
promote good biological activity anyway

236
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:54,639
you know

237
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,520
and let's talk about organic matter next

238
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,439
year

239
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:59,598
because i know that that really can go

240
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:01,759
hand in hand in a lot of cases

241
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:03,759
so so i don't find it it only gives me a

242
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,280
ton of you know actionable information

243
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,280
and i do also feel like when we talk

244
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:09,279
strictly about sets of organisms like

245
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:11,038
fungal versus bacterial and and what

246
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:12,478
those ratios may be

247
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:16,639
it's

248
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:17,918
it's too macroscopic of a view

249
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,199
to really

250
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:20,878
um

251
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,199
to really know what goes on i think we

252
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,560
we need our level of uh knowledge to

253
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,319
increase to where we can really start

254
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,478
looking at these species and how they

255
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,160
interact with particular crops and how

256
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:32,958
they interact with each other it's just

257
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,479
it's it's such a complex system right

258
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:36,239
it almost feels like an over over

259
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,240
simplification to me but you know what

260
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,599
are your thoughts on that

261
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,158
no i agree i think it is an

262
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:45,440
oversimplification and i think it's it

263
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:46,639
is this complex wild jungle and i think

264
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,240
there's a point in time when we're

265
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:50,559
trying to cultivate the antelope and the

266
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,519
lions are just gobbling them up right

267
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:55,199
and so that's fine if that's what your

268
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,320
goals are but i really don't i agree

269
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,680
these things aren't necessarily

270
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,440
actionable yet

271
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:01,199
i'm not saying it's not worthwhile to

272
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,880
try to catalog some of the stuff so

273
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,200
doing some type of regular analysis

274
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:07,039
potentially yearly analysis and again i

275
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,399
would do it under similar conditions and

276
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:10,879
similar time frames both you know

277
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:13,600
spatially temporarily and within your

278
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:15,039
production system so that it's it's it's

279
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,560
a repeated repetitive thing so you're

280
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:18,480
trying to measure the same point in time

281
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:20,838
the same kind of thing going on and then

282
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,519
you can maybe track some changes

283
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:25,680
potentially um but again what what

284
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,959
you're going to do about that i don't

285
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:27,919
know i think a lot of the things that

286
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:30,319
you're going to do you're going to do

287
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:32,319
anyway like you said you're trying to

288
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,600
you're trying to manage your organic

289
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,200
matter you're trying to manage your

290
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,959
cover you're trying to manage your water

291
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,879
you're trying to manage your nutrient

292
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:40,958
availability your ph's and all these

293
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:43,039
kinds of things to make sure that your

294
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:45,199
crop has the best and i think really the

295
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:47,439
best biological indicator

296
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,959
for us as people are the ones that are

297
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,440
easiest to see and i think your crop is

298
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:52,958
one of those when you have a healthy

299
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,720
well-producing crop i think it tells you

300
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:56,000
a lot about what's going on in the soil

301
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,680
and i'm not sure that we need to know

302
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,159
all of those details i i think that

303
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:01,759
little black box can stay black

304
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:03,838
if you have a healthy crop i mean that's

305
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:06,078
our ultimate goal why not measure that

306
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:09,560
rather than all of these

307
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:09,559
secondary indicators

308
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,799
yeah so i've stolen these and i can't

309
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,519
even give credit because it's so long

310
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:30,479
ago but uh so organic matter is composed

311
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:32,240
of you know three types of basic things

312
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,159
and it would be the living so the live

313
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,680
organisms the stuff that's going on and

314
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:37,120
and there and then it's the recently

315
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:38,879
dead the things that you can easily

316
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,679
identify you can see it's a plant or a

317
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:43,360
piece of a leaf or or or whatever and

318
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:46,239
then there's the the really dead they

319
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,320
call it which is the the dark colors and

320
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,159
you it's no longer distinguishable but

321
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,560
we know it's not a mineral we know that

322
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:54,319
it came from organic and it's not a it's

323
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:56,639
not a mineral so those are the three

324
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,320
kind of pools of organic matter and

325
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:59,919
those are all part of the deal and a lot

326
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,278
of people will call the long-term stuff

327
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:02,879
the humus

328
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:05,278
what's interesting is that after we

329
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:06,720
talked i looked into this more

330
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:10,320
and there's been some new science on

331
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:13,040
humus and the idea of long-term stable

332
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,720
organic matter and that may not be as

333
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:16,480
long-term as we originally thought

334
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,720
they've come up with new tools and

335
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,240
tactics to measure it we're measuring it

336
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,680
in different ways and prior to this

337
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,720
we've used a very harsh chemical

338
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:24,239
analysis

339
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,160
and then what came out of that at the

340
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,399
end was these very stable

341
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:30,559
compounds these organic matter compounds

342
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,639
when you use a really really strong acid

343
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:34,958
to dissolve things you change it

344
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:36,720
significantly and when it recombines it

345
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:38,078
combines into some very

346
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,320
strong structures

347
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:42,639
they've gone to using some microscopic

348
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,320
type of things as technologies improved

349
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:46,000
and they see that they think that this

350
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,680
longer term organic matter that the

351
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,679
really dead stuff that we can't identify

352
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:51,679
what it is may actually cycle quite a

353
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:54,958
bit faster than they thought it done

354
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:56,719
so that's quite interesting but um

355
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:58,399
again i don't know that it matters a

356
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,519
whole lot right

357
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:03,759
so so when i'm assessing soil i like to

358
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:06,480
i like to take a shovel i like to dig a

359
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:08,720
little hole i look for color i look for

360
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,079
structure or the pyramid ability the

361
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,920
ability of water to move through it the

362
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:14,559
ability of roots to move through it and

363
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:16,479
then i i love to smell that right i like

364
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:18,479
to get that earth and smell and see what

365
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,519
that smells like that smells good to us

366
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,200
and i wonder if that isn't an

367
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:23,200
evolutionary

368
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,720
thing for human beings that we're able

369
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,759
to smell good earth we understand what

370
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,680
that means

371
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:31,039
that those that didn't maybe didn't do

372
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:33,838
so well and so i think um part of that

373
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:35,599
is just this idea of this whole using

374
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,920
your senses to understand

375
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,720
what's going on and i think that

376
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:43,439
qualitative assessment can sometimes be

377
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,200
really really important and in certain

378
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,920
situations as important more important

379
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,519
than

380
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:48,879
a quantitative assessment because

381
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,720
quantitative only measures one thing at

382
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:52,159
a time versus when you or i are out

383
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,040
there with a shovel and a handful of

384
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:58,078
soil we're measuring and evaluating

385
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:58,078
several things at once

386
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,600
so you're almost like a detective

387
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,120
you know using those qualitative tools

388
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,040
and then the quantitative tools to

389
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,320
figure out whatever that limiting factor

390
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:10,719
of growth is

391
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,639
in regards to

392
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,240
plant health or maybe the farmer's

393
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,639
priorities um

394
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,879
you know those sorts of things right

395
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:21,200
yeah and so and i don't mean it to be

396
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:23,200
all you know fairy tales and rainbows

397
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,519
type of thing here but honestly when i'm

398
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:28,639
talking about we can measure you know

399
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:30,480
soil density and that type of thing and

400
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,799
bulk density of the soil it can be

401
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,240
measured and that tells us about pore

402
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:35,519
space and water permeability and all

403
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,600
those types of things or you can take a

404
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,679
shovel and you can put it into the soil

405
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,680
and you can feel the differences

406
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:43,278
between a compacted soil that has very

407
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:45,278
little pore space it's hard it's been

408
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:47,919
driven on your driveway versus

409
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:50,320
a really well-grown prairie native land

410
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:51,838
or trees or you know we have that

411
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,600
feeling and we can feel that as much

412
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,680
with a shovel and do that qualitatively

413
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,199
and understand what's going on so this

414
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:59,838
is something and it's actually much more

415
00:13:57,198 --> 00:14:01,919
rapid than trying to take an analytical

416
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,160
test now i use the analytical test to

417
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:05,919
back up these qualitative

418
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:07,919
measurements right because

419
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:09,439
i need to calibrate it some way

420
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:10,958
if i'm in a good mood i tend to measure

421
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,240
things a little more optimistically if

422
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:13,679
i'm having a rough day it may not be

423
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,360
quite so optimistic

424
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:16,479
so i have to make sure that i calibrate

425
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,919
it a little bit

426
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,680
i think it's really the combination of

427
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:22,399
the factors and then it's it's fitting

428
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:25,519
these pieces together in a specific

429
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:27,839
set to make it fit that particular

430
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:30,320
piece of land that particular farm that

431
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,639
particular goal set

432
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,839
you know for people who are unfamiliar

433
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,079
with

434
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:38,560
determining soil texture

435
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:40,159
you know i went to the issa meeting a

436
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:42,479
couple years back

437
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:44,639
and they had a booth there where people

438
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,759
could do essentially the soul ribbon

439
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:50,639
test and to determine you know the

440
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:52,480
the fractions of uh sand silt and clay

441
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:55,600
in the soil and and

442
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,879
some people are are quite accurate at

443
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,800
doing this

444
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:01,120
you know very close to what a you know

445
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:03,120
what a full analysis would tell you um

446
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,360
it's it's pretty fascinating so while it

447
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,198
is qualitative i will say you know i'm

448
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,079
not very good at it myself but it was it

449
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:12,159
was fun to see people that were

450
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:14,078
right and it's again this is a practice

451
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:16,399
and time thing and an experience thing

452
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:17,679
yeah and so i think once you so you got

453
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,078
to start somewhere you got to start at

454
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:21,838
the beginning yeah and so going to a

455
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:23,679
booth where they have okay this is a

456
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:26,320
high clay soil this is a high silt soil

457
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:27,838
this is a high sand saw gets you started

458
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,519
and then as you practice with it and

459
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:32,160
then you again you double check with

460
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,839
laboratory analysis so i do i do that

461
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:35,120
ribbon analysis everywhere i go i don't

462
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:38,240
necessarily like

463
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:40,078
write the numbers down 30 clay and 20

464
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,720
silts and you know that type of thing

465
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:45,679
but i've always have it in my hand

466
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,120
when i've taken the soil up i dig it up

467
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:48,559
i've got it in my hand i'll perform the

468
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,879
ribbon analysis the other thing that

469
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:52,799
i'll look at that is very difficult to

470
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:54,480
measure in the lab we can do it is the

471
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:56,000
soil aggregates those little chunks

472
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,600
those little nubbins and you'll hear

473
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,519
people talk about soil should look like

474
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,278
chocolate cake or should have little

475
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:04,000
lego blocks in them rather than just be

476
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:05,439
this massive fluff you'd rather not have

477
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,958
it as flour

478
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,759
because all of those little aggregates

479
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:10,239
are

480
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,360
they're individual cities and universes

481
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,519
for all these things when you think

482
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,600
about the scale of bacteria

483
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:17,600
they they need small places or

484
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,120
microscopic organisms so within one of

485
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,759
these little aggregates

486
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,759
there's all kinds of different

487
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:26,079
spaces for them to live i really think

488
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,759
about it as a city so there's a downtown

489
00:16:26,078 --> 00:16:29,838
where things are very dense and

490
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:32,720
congested and then there's there's kind

491
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:34,720
of that outskirts or the the area the

492
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,079
suburban area around the outside then

493
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,680
you get into the more rural area on the

494
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:38,879
outside of this aggregate

495
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:40,719
and to be quite honest with you there

496
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:41,919
are different biological things that

497
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,040
want to live in all of those different

498
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:44,958
spaces

499
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:47,198
and it has to do with you know oxygen

500
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:48,958
contents and water contents and nutrient

501
00:16:47,198 --> 00:16:50,799
availability and all that kind of stuff

502
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:52,719
so those aggregates provide several

503
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:54,399
little cities with many many many

504
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,160
environments for different types of

505
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:58,480
biology

506
00:16:56,159 --> 00:17:00,480
versus a fluffy soil that's more like

507
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,320
flower is a different type of landscape

508
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,480
it's much more uniform

509
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,640
it may be easier for us to manage

510
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,078
physically with planting equipment or

511
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,640
harvesting equipment and that type of

512
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:12,639
thing but it's not near as biologically

513
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,640
active as those little aggregates with

514
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,720
cities that have all these different

515
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,319
environments for those things and when

516
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,078
you look at it as a microbe if you're a

517
00:17:18,318 --> 00:17:21,759
bacteria trying to move a millimeter

518
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:23,599
isn't a possibility it's like me trying

519
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:25,359
to walk to across the country from

520
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:27,759
california to new york i just simply

521
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,639
can't do it in a in a reasonable time

522
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:29,359
frame

523
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,160
so

524
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:34,079
those are things that are easy to see

525
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,759
and assess and then you put them in your

526
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:38,079
fingers and you you start to crush them

527
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:39,679
how strong are they how stable are they

528
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:41,038
now we can measure all of this in a lab

529
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,720
but you have to be careful in how you

530
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:44,480
take it you send it to lab and then they

531
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,720
do a water shake test and it takes some

532
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,880
time they'll give you the aggregate size

533
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,880
fractions large ones medium small that

534
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,320
type of thing but we can do this right

535
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,400
in the field with a shovel with a little

536
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:55,359
bit of practice so we've determined

537
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,798
texture

538
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:59,519
then we can determine aggregate

539
00:17:56,798 --> 00:18:01,839
stability and that leads into water and

540
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:04,960
we've also determined bulk density and

541
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:04,959
all we needed was a shovel

542
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,840
so you're looking at in this case the

543
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,000
physical properties of the soil and then

544
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:13,439
from there you would turn to the sort of

545
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,798
the chemical properties and that's where

546
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,798
that lab test comes in handy

547
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,720
and then then we're then i'm

548
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,960
making assumptions

549
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,400
for the biology based on the physical

550
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,079
knowing that that

551
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,440
this aggregates kind of the build it and

552
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:29,359
they will come thing like if you give

553
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,600
them the environment the biology can

554
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:34,159
prosper in a better way

555
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:36,719
and i'm i'm not necessarily advocating

556
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,720
no-till for everything but you know

557
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,960
tillage is a necessary tool for us to

558
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,038
manage our crops and to do things in the

559
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,120
right ways where it's possible where you

560
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:47,440
can reduce that and maintain stable

561
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:48,719
aggregates it helps with your biology

562
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,720
it's one of the things that helps with

563
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,480
the biology

564
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,798
significant tillage

565
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,240
again and again and again is is

566
00:18:54,798 --> 00:18:57,599
challenging for biology and this is

567
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,359
where you'll see some of those ratios

568
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:01,199
change i think this is what people try

569
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:03,279
to use them for he's like well if your

570
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,960
bacterial ratio is getting really high

571
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:05,839
those are the ones again the short life

572
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,880
cycle

573
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:09,038
they re

574
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,440
they rebound much faster

575
00:19:09,038 --> 00:19:13,440
they can rebound in a few days versus

576
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:16,160
a fungi that you've taken and some of

577
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,279
them see my seal you're inches long and

578
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,880
you grind them up into these little

579
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:21,038
stubs well it's going to take them a lot

580
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,039
longer to regenerate and regrow and

581
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:24,879
their life cycles longer so you'll see

582
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:26,720
that if you do a pfla you'll see your

583
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,080
bacterial analysis will be much higher

584
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,400
than your fungal analysis and it might

585
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:31,918
be related to just you had to do tillage

586
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,600
and so does that mean you did the wrong

587
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,360
thing for your soil i don't know that it

588
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:37,119
does you may have needed to do that for

589
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:39,119
your production system

590
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:41,359
but if you measured it at that time you

591
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:42,798
may see that this is again a temporal

592
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:45,678
thing when you're measuring what you're

593
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:47,440
doing so all of these things that most i

594
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:49,519
can't see the bacteria but i can smell

595
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,919
them this is that good earth smell this

596
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:53,839
is the actinomyces bacteria

597
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:55,280
actinomycetes are their own little group

598
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:56,720
and those are

599
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:58,639
breaking down

600
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:01,038
organic compounds and they're releasing

601
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,960
specific aromatic compounds that we can

602
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:04,879
smell and we smell it as good earth

603
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,120
and that just means that your biology

604
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,440
biologically functioning i've been in

605
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:11,119
some soils that have a high salt content

606
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,200
just naturally and there's very little

607
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:14,479
if no smell to them at all

608
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,558
it's really because the salts are

609
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:19,880
preventing that biology from being

610
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:19,879
highly active

611
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,720
yeah you mentioned high salt so i mean

612
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,720
one of the things about be dealing with

613
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,159
outdoor crops is you kind of are stuck

614
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,159
with the conditions that you're stuck

615
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,919
with whether that's you know i've i've

616
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:35,720
seen high calcium

617
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,720
i've seen high salt

618
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:40,240
how do you approach these things so so

619
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,159
when you're testing you're testing

620
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,319
you're doing chemical analysis not just

621
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:48,080
on the um

622
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:51,439
the soil but the water as well

623
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:53,279
uh typically no this is undried soil um

624
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,880
but we can definitely do a chemical

625
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:57,200
analysis on water it's not something

626
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,440
that we do routinely one of the ways

627
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,919
that we measure salts or saline soils

628
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,600
here is actual electrical conductivity

629
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:05,280
and so we can do that in situ so this

630
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:06,558
isn't even sent to the lab so they have

631
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:08,319
a machine that

632
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:10,879
injects it

633
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:13,119
puts out an electrical current and so

634
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,320
electrical current and then it receives

635
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:16,399
how much comes through so we're actually

636
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:18,480
looking at conductance it's the inverse

637
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,840
resistance basically so what's going on

638
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,319
as long as we have a little bit of water

639
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:24,558
for the wire or the conduit that will

640
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:26,079
conduct electricity and the more solutes

641
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:28,000
you have the more salts you have the

642
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:30,000
more electricity gets conducted

643
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,119
so you'll have a higher reading and so

644
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,480
that's how

645
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:34,239
salts are typically measured is through

646
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,000
electrical conductivity that can be in

647
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,440
them done in the lab or in situ in the

648
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,519
field

649
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,279
so we can measure those things and then

650
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:42,798
the salts what they do is they really

651
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:43,759
it's pretty straightforward in most

652
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:46,720
cases

653
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:48,319
is it's just an osmotic thing the high

654
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,480
salts and the plants can't get the water

655
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:52,399
it acts like a drought as the salt pulls

656
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,079
harder than the plant can so then they

657
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,880
can't get moisture there are a few

658
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:58,798
situations where a specific ion will

659
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,960
interfere with other ions

660
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:03,119
and cause some issues or really high

661
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:06,079
concentrations of chloride per se can

662
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:07,839
become plant toxic that way

663
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:12,480
but it's typically a

664
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:14,879
drought inducing situation for us

665
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,960
yeah we use soluble salts or ec to

666
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,039
measure on the saturated paste to sort

667
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,880
of see what level of fertility we're

668
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:23,919
starting at

669
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:26,000
in uh you know indoor with

670
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:27,280
essentially potting soils or soilless

671
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,200
media

672
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:30,879
but it's a very different situation

673
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,400
because typically we can keep our sodium

674
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,320
content

675
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,600
you know substantially lower so we're

676
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:37,200
looking at what fraction of that is

677
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:38,959
actually sodium but

678
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,600
but we're also realizing that you know

679
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,360
this tells us sort of our fertility in

680
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:44,798
in some ways sure

681
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:46,719
it does because it's related to your

682
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:48,400
canada exchange capacity it really

683
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:52,558
relates directly because those charges

684
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,559
help conduct that electricity as well

685
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:58,240
so uh you know what are some examples of

686
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,960
when uh you feel like tillage is

687
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:04,079
important in a production system

688
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:06,000
so for me one of the main things um

689
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:08,399
tends to be a disease management type of

690
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,079
thing so while i'm

691
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,720
i'm a fan of

692
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:14,798
residue cover in in you know production

693
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,558
agricultural fields i don't like wind

694
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:19,038
erosion i don't like water version right

695
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:20,558
so so the plant material the biomass

696
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:22,400
from the previous crop is a really good

697
00:23:20,558 --> 00:23:25,440
way to protect that soil or armor it

698
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:28,480
from heavy rainfall or high wind events

699
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,240
but it's also the perfect place for

700
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,919
the fungi and bacteria and those

701
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,839
microorganisms to survive and

702
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,679
proliferate and be ready for next year's

703
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:37,839
crop and to attack you

704
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,919
so there are times when we

705
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:42,158
we need to manage the residue and i

706
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:44,320
think that's part of it and and how

707
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:45,760
aggressive you get is is

708
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:47,439
there are grades right it doesn't have

709
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:49,278
to go all the way from complete

710
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,640
annihilation of all soil structure and

711
00:23:49,278 --> 00:23:52,798
all plant material

712
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:56,000
there are grades across that and again

713
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:58,000
this is individual specific situations

714
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,919
what are you trying to accomplish is the

715
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
following crop going to be susceptible

716
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:04,240
to the potential diseases or did you use

717
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,839
that as one of your tools using a crop

718
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,440
that's not as susceptible to that

719
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:09,839
disease so then you don't have to worry

720
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:12,080
so much about that breakdown component

721
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:14,480
that type of thing the other time where

722
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:16,158
in production in particular where we're

723
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,159
using tillage as a tool is when we've

724
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:19,520
had to do field operations when we

725
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,278
shouldn't be there

726
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:23,679
when it's too wet

727
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:26,400
often we have too much moisture but the

728
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:29,440
crop is in jeopardy of being lost to the

729
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:31,038
weather and we simply have to physically

730
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,880
go out there and get it and with leave

731
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:34,558
tracks and ruts and

732
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,039
in the field and

733
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:38,558
some compaction and if you've moved soil

734
00:24:37,038 --> 00:24:39,919
and you've made impressions with heavy

735
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:41,599
equipment out there

736
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:43,440
it's not going to just magically

737
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:45,359
disappear you have to move the soil to

738
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,120
fill that in and to make another level

739
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:49,119
playing space

740
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:50,479
so again we're using it targeted that

741
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:51,839
way when

742
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,319
when we've made a

743
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:55,439
a management decision that we need to go

744
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:56,720
do something

745
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,880
and we've caused a problem and we're

746
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:01,038
using it as partial fix

747
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,520
so that's typically what i'm doing

748
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:06,158
uh tillage is used much more broadly in

749
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:07,759
my region um and it's used to manage

750
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:10,080
water primarily

751
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:12,319
um so fall moisture so guys are doing

752
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:14,399
tillage this fall here now getting ready

753
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:16,240
to reduce the moisture so that next year

754
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,440
it's drier to plant into and they can

755
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,558
they can plant easier under good

756
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,880
conditions

757
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:22,639
there are other ways to do that

758
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,400
increasing your infiltration rate using

759
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,600
some cover crops but again they have

760
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,400
their own drawbacks too

761
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:30,558
so

762
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,480
what essentially what i'm hearing is

763
00:25:30,558 --> 00:25:34,960
that none of these things are black and

764
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:37,599
white uh you know tillage isn't always

765
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,278
bad it isn't always good we need to look

766
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:40,480
at each situation

767
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:43,119
sort of

768
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,558
each field is as its own

769
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:47,199
you know

770
00:25:44,558 --> 00:25:49,119
in its own light i guess

771
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:52,240
now you've led me right into my tag line

772
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:53,119
my my my details matter i i tend to use

773
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,640
that

774
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:56,239
i was telling you i have i have a

775
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,240
sticker with my ugly face on it that

776
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,000
says details matter and i think that's

777
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,278
really the important part of this whole

778
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,079
thing is that

779
00:26:01,278 --> 00:26:05,359
you can you can get really good advice

780
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:07,119
from someone who has a little bit

781
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:08,240
different production system they can

782
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:09,199
tell you exactly how everything's

783
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,599
working

784
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,360
and and works for them and it's all

785
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:15,359
wonderful and then you go home and you

786
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:17,038
try to do it and you have a different

787
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:19,278
system or you have a different challenge

788
00:26:17,038 --> 00:26:21,519
or you your problems are not that type

789
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:22,880
of priority or your logistics don't work

790
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:25,200
out that way

791
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,960
and so really fitting those things and

792
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,480
getting that information is critically

793
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,640
valuable it's really valuable to get

794
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,640
information from other people from other

795
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:35,200
sources from good science-based sources

796
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,120
and you know locally and get great

797
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,558
distances so that you can try new ideas

798
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:40,399
and try new things

799
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:43,038
but it's also critically important to

800
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:45,200
apply that directly i use the dieting

801
00:26:43,038 --> 00:26:47,519
thing um i need to lose some weight i'm

802
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,960
overweight and i know it but

803
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:50,400
um i can't

804
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,120
there's certain foods that i i just

805
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,960
don't like and i won't eat and and that

806
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:57,359
type of thing so i have to fit this into

807
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,840
my system and if we talk about okay we'd

808
00:26:57,359 --> 00:27:01,918
love to exercise so exercise is a great

809
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:03,038
part of personal health okay well that's

810
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,320
great but are you going to run are you

811
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:06,000
going to walk are you going to swim are

812
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:08,240
you going to bike what are you gonna do

813
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,880
how does it fit into your life what time

814
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:13,278
frame do you have can you go for an hour

815
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:15,600
on a half on a long walk or do you have

816
00:27:13,278 --> 00:27:17,440
20 minutes and you need a treadmill like

817
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:19,119
those are the specifics

818
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,679
to each individual situation whether

819
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:24,158
it's the farm the farmer or the the acre

820
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:25,840
or that little small plot of land

821
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:27,919
those are the specifics that everything

822
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:30,879
has to be applied to

823
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:33,360
so for me i go for walks because i have

824
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,880
the time and i can do that and i tend to

825
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:36,319
do that at work rather than driving

826
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,159
around i'll just go walk across the

827
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:40,558
field so i'm getting more steps in and

828
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:42,240
i'm still doing two things at once

829
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:43,599
if you asked me to swim i would drown so

830
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,960
it's never going to work

831
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:46,798
so

832
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,240
no wonder swimming is a great way to

833
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:50,480
burn a lot of calories in a short period

834
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,919
of time but i don't swim so it's a very

835
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,599
poor fit for me

836
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:54,880
so it's along these same lines is like

837
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:56,558
you could have really really good ideas

838
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,799
from somewhere else do they fit into

839
00:27:56,558 --> 00:28:00,000
your system do they fit into the

840
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:02,079
the hard

841
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,519
rules that you have and then the next

842
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:05,599
question is can you change some of those

843
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:07,038
things maybe i should learn to swim

844
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:08,798
right so

845
00:28:07,038 --> 00:28:09,679
that's the next step but that's a bigger

846
00:28:08,798 --> 00:28:10,960
step

847
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:12,559
when you're trying to change your whole

848
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,399
logistics and your whole production

849
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:16,558
system for a particular practice because

850
00:28:14,398 --> 00:28:18,639
it sounds really good i would caution

851
00:28:16,558 --> 00:28:20,319
people about doing a lot of that be very

852
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,759
careful

853
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:24,319
well you and i talked about using

854
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:26,000
science too and

855
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:29,278
you know we may see research that shows

856
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,278
something to be really promising

857
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:34,240
you know in a lab or

858
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:36,640
in a in a trial field that but we can't

859
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,880
necessarily take that information and

860
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:41,600
apply it across our own farm or our own

861
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,640
given situation um

862
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:44,000
basically what you're saying is there's

863
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:48,159
a little more due diligence we need to

864
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:50,720
do before committing to a new idea right

865
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:52,880
right yeah i mean science is a is a

866
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:55,038
system of probability and this was the

867
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:57,039
thing that i mentioned earlier is that i

868
00:28:55,038 --> 00:28:59,359
think people under have this idea that

869
00:28:57,038 --> 00:29:00,158
well science says this it means exactly

870
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:02,079
that

871
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:03,919
when we actually use statistics and it's

872
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:06,079
all about probability so a lot of times

873
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:07,360
it's like well you've got a 95 chance

874
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:08,960
this is the outcome you're going to get

875
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:10,879
if you do these things

876
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,319
but it's it's not only if you just do

877
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,679
these things but if you do these things

878
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:16,480
with these certain situations in a

879
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:18,640
certain area so sciences tends to be

880
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:21,200
done in a very specific way

881
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:23,520
now that's not wrong what it's doing is

882
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,798
taking a lot of variables away so that

883
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:25,759
when they change one thing they're

884
00:29:24,798 --> 00:29:26,960
trying to make sure that's the only

885
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:29,038
thing that changes so that that's the

886
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,360
actual change they measure

887
00:29:29,038 --> 00:29:32,960
now in a production system we can't

888
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:35,119
manage all of those things to that level

889
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,519
where this is the only that is actually

890
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:38,959
changed and sometimes when you do add a

891
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:40,639
new practice you've had to change

892
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,960
several other things to do that like if

893
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,960
you were going to do less tillage well

894
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,798
you've done less tillage but that's also

895
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,720
changed your water profile it's changed

896
00:29:46,798 --> 00:29:50,879
your nutrient profile it's changed the

897
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,319
oxygenation has changed your aggregates

898
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,399
it's changed a lot of things that you

899
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:56,158
didn't intend it to change

900
00:29:54,398 --> 00:29:57,359
so even though a producer did one

901
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,399
different practice it actually could

902
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:01,199
change

903
00:29:58,398 --> 00:30:02,719
multiple things that are hard to track

904
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,798
so i think people need to understand

905
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,960
that science is a very good starting

906
00:30:04,798 --> 00:30:08,798
point and it's critically important i

907
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,399
would much rather have that than rumors

908
00:30:08,798 --> 00:30:12,319
or wive tales or

909
00:30:10,398 --> 00:30:15,199
you know somebody exaggerating how great

910
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:17,200
their stories are and we hear that too

911
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,278
and i think those are all dangerous so

912
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,200
we need the science to back that up but

913
00:30:19,278 --> 00:30:23,759
then the application so this is me i'm

914
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,600
an applied scientist so i i go and get

915
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:28,158
the science and then i try to fit it to

916
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:30,240
those scenarios and there are times when

917
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,919
really promising science doesn't fit in

918
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,440
a particular area

919
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:35,120
i had mentioned earlier we were talking

920
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,038
about cover crops before we started here

921
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:38,479
and and we talked about how they can be

922
00:30:37,038 --> 00:30:40,558
a really really good tool but if you

923
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,880
live in a very arid place where water is

924
00:30:40,558 --> 00:30:44,960
your absolute most limiting factor a

925
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,919
cover crop could be a very poor decision

926
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,200
for you

927
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:48,640
because it's going to take your most

928
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,880
valuable resource and use it for

929
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,840
something other than crop production

930
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,679
and that

931
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:55,839
that alone might be enough to say this

932
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:57,600
is not a good practice for us it doesn't

933
00:30:55,839 --> 00:31:01,119
mean that cover crops are a bad practice

934
00:30:57,599 --> 00:31:01,119
it just may not fit in that scenario

935
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:06,480
and how do you go about your cover crop

936
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,360
selection or determination

937
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,120
right

938
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:11,199
excellent so

939
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:13,678
my area makes a difference so i'm in in

940
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,720
north dakota and we have very cold

941
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:16,480
temperatures

942
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,240
the first thing we start off with though

943
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,839
is what are we trying to fix what are we

944
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,558
trying to manage what are we trying to

945
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:25,359
do with something with and i have

946
00:31:22,558 --> 00:31:27,759
probably three or four main goals

947
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:29,599
one of those is erosion protection so to

948
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:31,519
help me from wind and water erosion

949
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:33,439
another one is to actually manage excess

950
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:35,038
moisture we might have too much moisture

951
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:37,200
for the next spring and then the third

952
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:38,960
one will have poor producing soils or

953
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,159
those saline soils we've talked about

954
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,440
we're trying to do something different

955
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:43,679
with them

956
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,960
but basically once you've figured out

957
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:47,200
what your goal is what you're going to

958
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,558
try to do it's much easier to help you

959
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,480
select a crop

960
00:31:48,558 --> 00:31:51,678
because then you can figure out which

961
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,000
one's going to do what you want them to

962
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:56,559
do so for the moisture usage like if we

963
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,839
have excess moisture i try to use a crop

964
00:31:56,558 --> 00:31:59,599
that's going to be there

965
00:31:57,839 --> 00:32:01,439
more often

966
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:04,079
when i can't grow anything else so we'll

967
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:06,000
use a winter cereal like cereal rye up

968
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:08,639
here that we'll plant in the fall of the

969
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,640
year it'll grow in the fall use some

970
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,559
moisture in the fall it'll overwinter in

971
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,320
our harsh winters and it'll be growing

972
00:32:12,558 --> 00:32:16,480
next spring early on when we have snow

973
00:32:14,319 --> 00:32:18,240
melt and heavy rainfall and it'll help

974
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,360
us manage that excess moisture then we

975
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,440
can use

976
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:23,359
tillage or herbicides to terminate it

977
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:26,000
and plant our regular crop

978
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:28,158
so that's a really good fit

979
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,398
but if we're trying to do something

980
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:32,399
different it may not be the right fit

981
00:32:30,398 --> 00:32:34,398
and there are times when cereal is a bad

982
00:32:32,398 --> 00:32:36,319
fit simply because the following crop is

983
00:32:34,398 --> 00:32:38,558
going to be affected by it so i don't

984
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:41,278
like to see producers plant

985
00:32:38,558 --> 00:32:43,678
corn after cereal rye because the cereal

986
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:44,880
is very competitive and very aggressive

987
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:46,320
and it can actually hurt their corn

988
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,000
yield but if we're going to plant

989
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:49,119
soybean it's it's absolutely a great

990
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,038
idea

991
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:52,239
so this is those details matter what are

992
00:32:51,038 --> 00:32:54,000
you actually going to do with it what

993
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,519
are you trying to get out of it and once

994
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,278
you've set a goal like i want to manage

995
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:58,880
moisture i want to reduce excess

996
00:32:57,278 --> 00:33:00,558
moisture then it's much easier for you

997
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,159
to measure that both empirically and

998
00:33:00,558 --> 00:33:03,678
observationally

999
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:05,360
it's much easier to see if you just want

1000
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:06,399
to plant cover crops for a healthier

1001
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:08,240
soil

1002
00:33:06,398 --> 00:33:11,839
well what does that mean it's very hard

1003
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,839
to measure in any way

1004
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,278
i i really like that

1005
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:17,678
explanation

1006
00:33:15,278 --> 00:33:20,240
this is a little bit outside of you know

1007
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:21,600
your area of

1008
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,120
of work

1009
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:25,678
but i get a lot of people running cover

1010
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:27,599
crops indoors and when we talk about the

1011
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:29,360
reasons why we use cover crops that you

1012
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:31,199
listed there you know most of those

1013
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:32,240
don't really apply like we don't have

1014
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,159
the same

1015
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,200
water challenges we don't have wind

1016
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:36,080
erosion

1017
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,600
um

1018
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:40,079
you know we don't have these things and

1019
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:42,000
and while cover crops are are wonderful

1020
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:43,759
this is sort of where you get into that

1021
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,839
you know it's not so it's not so black

1022
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:48,158
and white like what is our goal because

1023
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:50,158
when we talk about fertility well now we

1024
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:53,519
just added a whole other variable that's

1025
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:55,440
a lot harder to measure

1026
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:57,038
versus being able to add a specific

1027
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:59,360
fertilizer

1028
00:33:57,038 --> 00:34:01,278
to to get whatever you know macro or

1029
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:02,558
micronutrient we're looking for now

1030
00:34:01,278 --> 00:34:04,798
we're trying to

1031
00:34:02,558 --> 00:34:06,720
you know gauge the breakdown of this of

1032
00:34:04,798 --> 00:34:09,119
this organic matter this cover crop you

1033
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:11,119
know we have competition for nutrient

1034
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:13,200
now with our actual crop because people

1035
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:15,280
want to run them not as a as a separate

1036
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:17,838
crop but as a as a

1037
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:19,440
as a poly cropping essentially companion

1038
00:34:17,838 --> 00:34:20,480
plant

1039
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:23,039
and then we have

1040
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:25,918
you know disease and habitat concerns

1041
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:25,918
for pests

1042
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,199
it becomes a little bit of a nightmare

1043
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:31,039
on scale you know i think it works fine

1044
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:33,759
in a small tent and there are some

1045
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:36,079
people that are doing it on scale but

1046
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,800
it's it's rare and i think it's a you

1047
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:39,599
know

1048
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:42,399
i i feel like as a

1049
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:44,159
as a gardener um or a farmer what we can

1050
00:34:42,398 --> 00:34:46,878
do to eliminate

1051
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:49,519
you know labor eliminate or reduce labor

1052
00:34:46,878 --> 00:34:52,159
sorry and reduce variability

1053
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:54,159
makes it easier for us to make decisions

1054
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:55,599
on our crop if we're applying you know

1055
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:57,119
50 different things and spraying all

1056
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:59,119
these different things like we see some

1057
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:01,838
guys do

1058
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:03,440
it's hard to know what's good what's bad

1059
00:35:01,838 --> 00:35:04,880
what's um

1060
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,480
innocuous

1061
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,320
in this in the system like that it's

1062
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,599
it's very complex and when i come on

1063
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,519
onto the scene you know when they tell

1064
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:12,960
me well i did this this and this

1065
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:15,679
i haven't done a soil test you know

1066
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:18,000
what's going on with my plant i

1067
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:19,838
i really i really can't say there's too

1068
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,920
many there's too many if there i

1069
00:35:19,838 --> 00:35:23,759
couldn't say there's no way and and i

1070
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,800
think really this is you know when

1071
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,320
you're when you're talking about this is

1072
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,560
risk management right so you're trying

1073
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:30,800
to manage your risk um because at the

1074
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:32,159
end we want these people to all be

1075
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,000
effective in

1076
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:35,759
economically beneficial businesses we

1077
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,960
want every business to survive and

1078
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,680
thrive

1079
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,920
so

1080
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:42,399
really that's about risk management and

1081
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:44,639
in the situation you described where you

1082
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,160
actually have control over erosion you

1083
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:48,078
have control over the water you have

1084
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:49,679
control over the nutrients

1085
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:51,440
that's a very different thing so those

1086
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:52,719
are the things i don't have control over

1087
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,559
so i'm using

1088
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:56,480
the cover crops to help manage that risk

1089
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:58,480
for us but you're taking those really

1090
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,639
right off your risk plate and now you

1091
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:03,039
add all of those alternatives and and

1092
00:36:00,639 --> 00:36:06,000
honestly all of these these additional

1093
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:07,599
crops have their own biological

1094
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,079
benefits but they also have their own

1095
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:11,920
attractions like it's it's the idea of

1096
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:14,079
when there's a lot of anything there's

1097
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,680
going to be whatever eats it is going to

1098
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:18,079
be proliferating

1099
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:19,598
so disease can be a significant issue

1100
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:22,079
and unfortunately a lot of our fungal

1101
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:24,240
disease in particular are very good at

1102
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:25,760
adapting to several hosts

1103
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:28,000
and i'm very concerned about that too

1104
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:29,359
for us for so white mold is one of the

1105
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,280
problems that we have i would imagine

1106
00:36:29,358 --> 00:36:34,960
some of your producers have white mold

1107
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:36,240
challenges and it's got a very wide um

1108
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,320
host range

1109
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:40,239
so a lot of different plants can

1110
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,519
proliferate that and increase that and

1111
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:43,118
that's something that's very very

1112
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:44,639
difficult to manage once you get a high

1113
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:46,559
inoculum

1114
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:47,759
population is that essentially the same

1115
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:49,599
thing as powdery mildew are you

1116
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,760
referring to a different

1117
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:54,000
white mold i'm referring to sclerotinia

1118
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:56,720
yeah but well okay so white mold powdery

1119
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,599
mildew does also have a fairly wide

1120
00:36:56,719 --> 00:36:59,439
um

1121
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:01,838
host range and

1122
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,039
it likes those high humidity situations

1123
00:37:01,838 --> 00:37:04,480
that you're having so yeah you could

1124
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:06,880
definitely increase the inoculum in

1125
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,559
there and make that much worse for the

1126
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,838
cover crop versus

1127
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:11,759
this is one of the things we do in

1128
00:37:09,838 --> 00:37:12,880
agriculture is we actually break natural

1129
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,280
cycles

1130
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,640
in order to produce a crop specifically

1131
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:19,119
for our needs

1132
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:20,639
yeah and that's i think this is i want

1133
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:22,800
to kind of jump into that you know egg

1134
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:25,118
is not nature even gardening is not

1135
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,079
nature um you're trying to produce as

1136
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:28,160
certain

1137
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:29,920
things that you want

1138
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:31,440
and to the exclusion of other things you

1139
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,039
don't want this is the whole idea that

1140
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,720
we have weeds

1141
00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:36,320
you can argue that an invasive species

1142
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:38,239
always a weed but there are a lot of

1143
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:40,400
times when native species are considered

1144
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:43,118
a weed because they're less desirable or

1145
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,920
they're hurting your crop or whatever so

1146
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:45,440
um

1147
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,039
we're trying we're not we're not trying

1148
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:49,519
to replicate nature

1149
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:51,199
nature produces whatever it can with the

1150
00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:52,800
resources it has and it doesn't produce

1151
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:55,118
for any one particular species in

1152
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,160
general it produces for everybody and

1153
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:57,599
actually

1154
00:37:56,159 --> 00:37:59,759
to any plant

1155
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:01,280
an insect is a predator typically a

1156
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,800
caterpillar is always a bad thing to

1157
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,680
plants because that's that's who eats

1158
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,000
you

1159
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:08,239
so it's not a beneficial thing so it's

1160
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,679
about your perspective this again goes

1161
00:38:08,239 --> 00:38:11,279
to if you're watching the nature show or

1162
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:13,039
you're cheering for the antelope or

1163
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,400
you're cheering for the lion

1164
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:15,679
because they're both biological

1165
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,480
organisms

1166
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:20,480
and it just depends on your perspective

1167
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:23,280
in agriculture we're trying to produce

1168
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:25,920
things for one species for humans

1169
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:28,000
and and so that's it's a very narrow

1170
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,920
subset so we're trying to stack the deck

1171
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,960
in our arts to produce as much as we can

1172
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,559
for us

1173
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,079
and that's really a sustainability goal

1174
00:38:32,559 --> 00:38:36,400
because now we need less acreage and

1175
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:38,079
less less resources in order to do that

1176
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,599
so if we're really efficient

1177
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:42,560
at producing what we want for our

1178
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:44,240
species then we're using less in general

1179
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:45,759
versus if we were all trying to forage

1180
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:47,358
out of nature well then we'd have to

1181
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,880
compete with everything else

1182
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:50,639
so i think this goes back into those

1183
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:53,200
ideas of like i think it's wise to

1184
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:55,358
control these scenarios and to keep keep

1185
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:57,199
your risk low and not add a bunch of

1186
00:38:55,358 --> 00:38:59,119
variables and you're producing a bunch

1187
00:38:57,199 --> 00:39:00,799
of other things you're using fertilizer

1188
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:02,320
and water and organic matter resources

1189
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,519
to breed disease because you grew a

1190
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:07,359
cover crop

1191
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:07,358
i don't know that that's a wise choice

1192
00:39:07,838 --> 00:39:10,320
yeah you know i think i think we have to

1193
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:11,920
be

1194
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:14,400
you know for someone who's passionate

1195
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:16,079
about organics and sustainability i

1196
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,000
think we have to be cognizant of where

1197
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:19,680
we're sourcing our materials so if we

1198
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,800
are going to use fertilizer how do we do

1199
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:24,078
it in a way

1200
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:27,599
that has less of an impact on our

1201
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:29,280
you know local and world ecology

1202
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:31,119
what industries are we supporting with

1203
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:34,160
where we're sourcing these you know

1204
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:37,119
micro and macro nutrients um

1205
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:39,759
but at the same time adding you know a

1206
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:41,358
cover crop or adding uh

1207
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,839
you know a second crop

1208
00:39:41,358 --> 00:39:45,920
is it doesn't get us anywhere close to

1209
00:39:43,838 --> 00:39:48,400
the diversity and complexity that we

1210
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:50,320
would have in a natural system

1211
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:52,639
we're still essentially monocropping

1212
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:54,480
when we look at you know just how vast

1213
00:39:52,639 --> 00:39:57,039
of a difference

1214
00:39:54,480 --> 00:40:01,358
in diversity there is

1215
00:39:57,039 --> 00:40:03,838
right now i think mono cropping on on

1216
00:40:01,358 --> 00:40:06,239
gets a bad rap and i don't know that it

1217
00:40:03,838 --> 00:40:08,559
should get as bad a rap as it's getting

1218
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:11,358
um i i

1219
00:40:08,559 --> 00:40:12,559
again if it's if it's efficient and it's

1220
00:40:11,358 --> 00:40:14,159
producing

1221
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:15,759
what we need it to

1222
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:18,480
at the right timing then i don't know

1223
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:19,359
that it's necessarily like after all bad

1224
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:22,079
thing

1225
00:40:19,358 --> 00:40:24,639
um and i think it's just kind of cast is

1226
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:27,519
all evil like monocropping now i'm not a

1227
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:30,400
huge fan of growing the same crop

1228
00:40:27,519 --> 00:40:32,480
forever in the same situation the same

1229
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,240
but it sometimes it makes sense

1230
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,599
one of the challenges there is you're

1231
00:40:34,239 --> 00:40:37,598
breeding your diseases your pest

1232
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:39,119
problems are depleting resources if

1233
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:40,640
you're using the same crop it wants the

1234
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:43,280
same demands again and again and again

1235
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:45,199
so i think that can be challenging

1236
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:47,119
but um

1237
00:40:45,199 --> 00:40:48,799
it doesn't necessarily i i'm not

1238
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:50,400
convinced monocropping is bad it gets

1239
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,400
this really bad rap like it's just a

1240
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,400
terrible thing but if it's highly

1241
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:56,800
efficient and highly effective then

1242
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:59,119
maybe it's the right thing to do

1243
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:01,359
there's been a lot of you know negative

1244
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:02,640
press about livestock production

1245
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:04,480
people are saying well why don't we just

1246
00:41:02,639 --> 00:41:06,639
use land that we're using for livestock

1247
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,000
for crops because there's less

1248
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:09,759
footprint there

1249
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,440
well this land is not necessarily

1250
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:13,200
suitable for crop production it's one of

1251
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,358
the reasons it's in livestock production

1252
00:41:13,199 --> 00:41:17,439
you can't farm it it's either too hilly

1253
00:41:15,358 --> 00:41:18,639
too rocky too sandy too light all of

1254
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:21,119
those types of things it needs a

1255
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:23,118
perennial plant and really

1256
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:24,720
the way that we're we're gaining human

1257
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:28,160
benefit from most perennial plants is

1258
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:28,159
through protein animal protein

1259
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,719
and livestock has the ability to improve

1260
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:34,960
land as much as it has to destroy land i

1261
00:41:32,719 --> 00:41:36,239
would say if it's managed correctly the

1262
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,000
way it's managed

1263
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:39,598
exactly and so those are some of your

1264
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,199
organic inputs right so if you're using

1265
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:43,599
livestock manures

1266
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:45,358
as part of your fertility but then again

1267
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:47,039
you've got to be careful because if this

1268
00:41:45,358 --> 00:41:48,318
we're talking about lettuce production

1269
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:49,519
or we're talking about fresh market

1270
00:41:48,318 --> 00:41:52,159
types of things

1271
00:41:49,519 --> 00:41:53,920
there are little tag-along biologicals

1272
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:54,719
that we don't want in there salmonella

1273
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,960
and

1274
00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:58,879
clostridiums and all of that good stuff

1275
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:01,519
so then you use another biological

1276
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:03,280
process composting to to reset that

1277
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:05,119
system so we've changed what type of

1278
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,480
biology is there so

1279
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:08,079
now we have biology that's less

1280
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,838
threatening to human health

1281
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:11,680
and so i think it's really about it

1282
00:42:09,838 --> 00:42:14,318
comes back to management and again your

1283
00:42:11,679 --> 00:42:16,078
management has to set goals clear goals

1284
00:42:14,318 --> 00:42:18,239
that make sense what are you trying to

1285
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:19,680
accomplish where are you trying to go

1286
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:21,118
what are you trying to get to and how

1287
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:22,719
are you trying to do it and then you can

1288
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:24,480
assess your system and see what are your

1289
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:25,838
challenges your problems your your

1290
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,679
bottlenecks

1291
00:42:25,838 --> 00:42:28,960
and then you can start to devise some

1292
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:30,480
systems that

1293
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,240
target those

1294
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,920
and and then move forward this is i

1295
00:42:32,239 --> 00:42:36,559
don't think i think that's everything

1296
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:38,480
from gardening a plant in your house to

1297
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:39,838
thousands of acres of crop production is

1298
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,358
you really have to have what are you

1299
00:42:39,838 --> 00:42:43,119
trying to accomplish

1300
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:46,960
what are your limitations and what are

1301
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:46,960
your plans and strategies to manage them

1302
00:42:47,039 --> 00:42:50,559
well you know for

1303
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:52,639
for me what i hear a lot of it's just

1304
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:53,920
it's yield you know people approach this

1305
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:55,679
like a business

1306
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:58,318
they say you know i don't

1307
00:42:55,679 --> 00:43:00,000
i don't care about the the methodology

1308
00:42:58,318 --> 00:43:01,279
the soil because in this case you know a

1309
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,800
lot of people are i'm talking about

1310
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,839
indoor production

1311
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,200
they just want to know that they're

1312
00:43:03,838 --> 00:43:08,960
going to get a yield and then they can

1313
00:43:05,199 --> 00:43:10,960
get a price per pound for that yield

1314
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:13,440
and some of that feels short-sighted to

1315
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:15,440
me in some ways because i think we can

1316
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:18,000
create systems that are more sustainable

1317
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:19,519
and allow for lower cost of production

1318
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,519
over time

1319
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:23,759
with with our media choices and our

1320
00:43:21,519 --> 00:43:24,800
production choices but um you know at

1321
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:27,280
the end of the day what do you do when a

1322
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:30,240
farmer is just i you know just wants

1323
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:33,200
wants to talk about yield

1324
00:43:30,239 --> 00:43:34,879
yeah well to me i i hear you on the

1325
00:43:33,199 --> 00:43:37,358
yield conversation but i think i think

1326
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:39,519
we need to talk about economic yield and

1327
00:43:37,358 --> 00:43:42,000
that's more profitability like it's

1328
00:43:39,519 --> 00:43:44,880
really about profit because if you're if

1329
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,559
you're producing a huge yield but you

1330
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,800
it's cost you a lot of money to produce

1331
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:50,318
it and your profits small

1332
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:52,720
that's still really difficult to run a

1333
00:43:50,318 --> 00:43:54,559
business if you can maximize your profit

1334
00:43:52,719 --> 00:43:56,480
through some simple situations and

1335
00:43:54,559 --> 00:43:58,480
that's that's really where you try to go

1336
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,920
and and my farmers talk exactly the same

1337
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:03,199
way as yours do if they want to talk

1338
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:05,119
you'll be you'll be all field and the

1339
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:07,519
the hard part is it's much easier to

1340
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:09,358
compare yield between your neighbor and

1341
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:12,239
your friend and the next guy and the

1342
00:44:09,358 --> 00:44:14,559
competitor like that's just one number

1343
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:16,318
to get their actual economics some of

1344
00:44:14,559 --> 00:44:18,318
these productions whether they're a big

1345
00:44:16,318 --> 00:44:20,400
egg or a small egg they don't know their

1346
00:44:18,318 --> 00:44:21,199
cost to production as well as they maybe

1347
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,119
should

1348
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:24,799
and then they're not going to share that

1349
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:26,800
open either and

1350
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,960
so you can't it's hard to compare

1351
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,960
compare profit

1352
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:33,119
i think there are significant gains when

1353
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:35,920
you change some systems and you reduce

1354
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:37,680
some expenses you can maintain or get

1355
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,559
very close to the premium yield that you

1356
00:44:37,679 --> 00:44:39,759
had

1357
00:44:38,559 --> 00:44:42,318
even though you're doing these really

1358
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:44,319
expensive um opportunities we've seen it

1359
00:44:42,318 --> 00:44:46,960
in production ag really regularly and

1360
00:44:44,318 --> 00:44:48,880
it's more due to tillage and the cost of

1361
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:51,119
big tractors and equipment and tillage

1362
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,960
and fuel and electronics stuff that if

1363
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:54,640
we can reduce our tillage we save all

1364
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:56,159
the expenses and we get very similar

1365
00:44:54,639 --> 00:44:59,358
yields

1366
00:44:56,159 --> 00:45:01,679
um not the same yields without all that

1367
00:44:59,358 --> 00:45:01,679
input

1368
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:06,720
so what you're saying is

1369
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:08,480
we have to factor in our expenses and

1370
00:45:06,719 --> 00:45:10,000
you know they may you may not know their

1371
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:12,240
cost of labor you may not know their

1372
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,679
cost of equipment or infrastructure

1373
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:15,598
to get that

1374
00:45:13,679 --> 00:45:17,279
you know larger yield you know if you

1375
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:20,160
can produce

1376
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:21,920
a lower amount

1377
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:23,598
with less cost of production you could

1378
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:25,599
actually be coming out ahead at the end

1379
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:27,119
of the day

1380
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:28,559
yeah i think that detail in every

1381
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:30,720
business matters i think you really need

1382
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:33,679
to i really want people to

1383
00:45:30,719 --> 00:45:35,118
to do their profit analysis that's

1384
00:45:33,679 --> 00:45:36,639
critically important

1385
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:38,000
and that is a detail that matters to

1386
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:40,159
their business and not necessarily to

1387
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,519
their neighbors business

1388
00:45:40,159 --> 00:45:43,679
but it's probably the most important

1389
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:46,960
detail

1390
00:45:43,679 --> 00:45:49,519
yeah i i that makes a lot of sense i

1391
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:51,679
i i see where people get caught up in

1392
00:45:49,519 --> 00:45:52,960
that sort of uh game of who can produce

1393
00:45:51,679 --> 00:45:55,039
the most but at the end of the day

1394
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:56,720
that's not necessarily the

1395
00:45:55,039 --> 00:45:58,239
important variable in the coffee shop

1396
00:45:56,719 --> 00:45:59,759
bragging right and if you want to have

1397
00:45:58,239 --> 00:46:01,439
the best yield you'd be the last guy to

1398
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:03,040
tell them what it is

1399
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:05,119
because because who's actually checking

1400
00:46:03,039 --> 00:46:06,960
those numbers right

1401
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:08,640
and

1402
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:10,240
we're all susceptible to try to being

1403
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:11,920
better than your neighbor and if you're

1404
00:46:10,239 --> 00:46:15,039
the last person to announce their yield

1405
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:16,960
you might just edge it up a hair just to

1406
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:17,838
make sure you get a little better

1407
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,838
so

1408
00:46:17,838 --> 00:46:21,358
you know and in my industry

1409
00:46:19,838 --> 00:46:22,480
what's really important too is crop

1410
00:46:21,358 --> 00:46:23,759
quality

1411
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:25,679
depending on the quality of that crop

1412
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:28,560
really in terms of value and how you can

1413
00:46:25,679 --> 00:46:29,519
market and sell it um and i think that's

1414
00:46:28,559 --> 00:46:31,119
something

1415
00:46:29,519 --> 00:46:34,000
that is important when we talk about a

1416
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:34,000
production system

1417
00:46:35,358 --> 00:46:40,318
well let's let's move on from that topic

1418
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:42,160
uh and talk a little bit more i wanted

1419
00:46:40,318 --> 00:46:44,079
to just jump back to soil testing a

1420
00:46:42,159 --> 00:46:46,159
little bit when you look at a chemical

1421
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:48,240
analysis of a soil

1422
00:46:46,159 --> 00:46:50,078
what are some particular

1423
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:52,078
you know levers or numbers that you look

1424
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:54,240
at that really stand out when you start

1425
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:56,960
to first begin

1426
00:46:54,239 --> 00:46:59,358
you know adjusting uh you know the

1427
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:02,079
fertility in the soil

1428
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:04,400
right for my area

1429
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:05,599
ph is a big one i think any area ph is

1430
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:07,358
going to be something you really want to

1431
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:09,440
have a handle on because it affects the

1432
00:47:07,358 --> 00:47:10,639
availability of all your nutrients and

1433
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:12,480
it affects your crop growth so i think

1434
00:47:10,639 --> 00:47:14,480
that's a critical one

1435
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:16,400
i look at soluble salts

1436
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:18,719
more because we have excess soluble

1437
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:20,800
salts and it's indicative of some of the

1438
00:47:18,719 --> 00:47:23,439
challenges we may have and then i focus

1439
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:24,400
on the macronutrients i really do

1440
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:27,119
nitrogen

1441
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:28,639
phosphorus potassium sulfur and zinc and

1442
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:30,640
i know zinc is considered a

1443
00:47:28,639 --> 00:47:32,159
micronutrient but it's on the higher end

1444
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:33,679
of those levels and it tends to be one

1445
00:47:32,159 --> 00:47:36,000
of those it's more challenging for us

1446
00:47:33,679 --> 00:47:37,759
and again this is related to our phs

1447
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,280
in my neighborhood a lot of our ph's are

1448
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:40,880
on the higher side

1449
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:43,359
we're at least seven two and sometimes

1450
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:45,358
we get into seven eight and even eight

1451
00:47:43,358 --> 00:47:48,159
eight ph's in some places and that

1452
00:47:45,358 --> 00:47:49,199
affects our zinc dramatically so i pay

1453
00:47:48,159 --> 00:47:52,799
attention to those and those

1454
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:56,000
interactions oh can i yeah

1455
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:57,440
i want to talk about zinc but can we

1456
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,000
uh well first of all i want to ask you a

1457
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:01,519
real point black question regarding uh

1458
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,400
ph but then i want to talk a little bit

1459
00:48:01,519 --> 00:48:06,880
about how you lower ph so first off

1460
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:08,240
you know i get a lot of guys in organics

1461
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,920
uh you know in this in the canvas

1462
00:48:08,239 --> 00:48:13,439
industry that say you know ph doesn't

1463
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:15,760
matter i can throw out my ph pen um even

1464
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:17,519
in organics do you feel like ph plays a

1465
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:21,520
role in

1466
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:23,838
in you know optimizing production

1467
00:48:21,519 --> 00:48:25,759
well ph is the overriding factor of

1468
00:48:23,838 --> 00:48:28,480
nutrient availability

1469
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:30,559
now there's a fairly wide set where ph

1470
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:33,199
is optimized it would be anywhere from

1471
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:34,880
about five eight to six two six four is

1472
00:48:33,199 --> 00:48:36,000
really where your ph is where you want

1473
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:37,680
it to be if you're going to choose it

1474
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,960
that's where you you'd want to be in

1475
00:48:37,679 --> 00:48:40,719
that 6 2

1476
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:42,639
range would be like the perfect ph for

1477
00:48:40,719 --> 00:48:44,799
nutrient availability

1478
00:48:42,639 --> 00:48:47,039
once you start getting down into the the

1479
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:48,960
low fives you have aluminum toxicities

1480
00:48:47,039 --> 00:48:51,199
and you have other issues with

1481
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:53,599
inavailability of that

1482
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:56,318
high end ph you have calcium tying up

1483
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:58,559
phosphorus and zinc and a lot of those

1484
00:48:56,318 --> 00:48:59,838
macronutrients and if you have high ph

1485
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:02,480
and you're tying up all the nutrients

1486
00:48:59,838 --> 00:49:04,480
you can apply more but they get tied up

1487
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:06,719
and they're not available readily unless

1488
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:09,119
you're using a chelating agent so that's

1489
00:49:06,719 --> 00:49:12,318
probably the better way to manage it

1490
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:14,640
so what i find with organics is

1491
00:49:12,318 --> 00:49:16,558
ph still matters we just find that a lot

1492
00:49:14,639 --> 00:49:19,598
of the practices people are using in

1493
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:21,599
organics may lead them into a ph that

1494
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:23,680
falls within a range i guess essentially

1495
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:26,079
there's more buffering capacity

1496
00:49:23,679 --> 00:49:28,639
with uh when you have higher organic

1497
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:30,640
organic matter things like that yeah you

1498
00:49:28,639 --> 00:49:32,000
have high organic matter soils it's

1499
00:49:30,639 --> 00:49:34,799
going to be in that

1500
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,639
that sweet spot of ph and you have

1501
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:38,960
you're going to have a lot more

1502
00:49:36,639 --> 00:49:40,558
exchange sites and i can see where

1503
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:42,159
that's going to be

1504
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:43,920
less of a concern

1505
00:49:42,159 --> 00:49:45,039
yeah than it would be in a mineral soil

1506
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:46,880
when you're an organic soil it's going

1507
00:49:45,039 --> 00:49:47,679
to be less of a concern yeah i can see

1508
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:49,280
that

1509
00:49:47,679 --> 00:49:51,358
and you know

1510
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:53,839
with and again i'm talking about

1511
00:49:51,358 --> 00:49:57,119
artificial soilless media here uh

1512
00:49:53,838 --> 00:49:59,279
potting soils i find sort of for me six

1513
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:02,400
six to six eight is sort of my sweet

1514
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:04,079
spot where the soils want to settle uh

1515
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,358
because of a lot of the alkaline inputs

1516
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:08,000
we're using

1517
00:50:05,358 --> 00:50:09,920
you know specifically adding biochar uh

1518
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,239
the high amounts of calcium in the soil

1519
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:14,079
i have trouble keeping calcium and some

1520
00:50:12,239 --> 00:50:16,719
of the cations up when we start dropping

1521
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:19,200
ph below six six

1522
00:50:16,719 --> 00:50:20,719
yeah i can see that yep yeah cause

1523
00:50:19,199 --> 00:50:22,078
they're gonna they're gonna get

1524
00:50:20,719 --> 00:50:24,480
associated with all kinds of other

1525
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:26,160
things going on yeah and calcium is one

1526
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:28,880
of the ways to kind of jack your ph a

1527
00:50:26,159 --> 00:50:30,239
little bit right so and carbonate um to

1528
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:31,519
bring that up some limiting and that

1529
00:50:30,239 --> 00:50:33,118
type of thing

1530
00:50:31,519 --> 00:50:35,199
again retarding solace media it's a very

1531
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:38,160
different thing so that's a little bit

1532
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:40,558
outside of my parameters sure sure no i

1533
00:50:38,159 --> 00:50:41,679
do realize they're very different um

1534
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:43,040
creatures and a lot of people don't

1535
00:50:41,679 --> 00:50:44,000
realize that

1536
00:50:43,039 --> 00:50:45,440
uh

1537
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,039
and we have to look at the soil test

1538
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:48,639
differently there's some numbers we just

1539
00:50:47,039 --> 00:50:49,679
have to throw out on a soil test because

1540
00:50:48,639 --> 00:50:51,199
they're just not

1541
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:53,358
uh calibrated

1542
00:50:51,199 --> 00:50:55,759
for not meaning soils yeah

1543
00:50:53,358 --> 00:50:57,279
but um how do you so how do you deal

1544
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:59,520
with lower lowering p so i had a

1545
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:01,519
greenhouse situation uh where the

1546
00:50:59,519 --> 00:51:03,519
gentleman had a quite a high ph close to

1547
00:51:01,519 --> 00:51:06,318
eight uh we were looking at ways to

1548
00:51:03,519 --> 00:51:08,239
rapidly lower it and sort of the the

1549
00:51:06,318 --> 00:51:10,639
things that i saw mixed results with

1550
00:51:08,239 --> 00:51:12,000
people with adding you know peat moss

1551
00:51:10,639 --> 00:51:13,598
in terms of what the research shows

1552
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,599
whether or not that works again this is

1553
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:16,640
not on the scale that you're used to so

1554
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:18,880
i know these aren't things that you

1555
00:51:16,639 --> 00:51:19,920
would normally deal with

1556
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:23,200
or

1557
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:25,280
agricultural sulfur um

1558
00:51:23,199 --> 00:51:27,519
things like that like what

1559
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:29,200
what approaches do you take to lower

1560
00:51:27,519 --> 00:51:31,519
lower ph you know adding things to the

1561
00:51:29,199 --> 00:51:31,519
water

1562
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:36,720
yeah that might be your your best bet

1563
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:38,800
in that scenario so

1564
00:51:36,719 --> 00:51:40,879
you're talking about elemental sulfur as

1565
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:42,079
one of those things and that that is so

1566
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:44,000
anything that's going to be of an

1567
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:45,920
acidific nature that's going to

1568
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,679
going to grab on and

1569
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:49,358
and leave hydrogen ions behind is going

1570
00:51:47,679 --> 00:51:50,558
to do that um

1571
00:51:49,358 --> 00:51:52,960
so

1572
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:55,920
nitrogen you know ammonia and nitrogen

1573
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:57,760
can can actually reduce ph

1574
00:51:55,920 --> 00:52:00,800
but we're talking about you know the

1575
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:02,960
scale here is ridiculous and before you

1576
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:05,119
you lower your ph much you tend to have

1577
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:07,440
toxic levels of sulfur or nitrogen or

1578
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:09,838
whatever because it takes so much of

1579
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:11,440
that to move it so there is you know so

1580
00:52:09,838 --> 00:52:12,960
ph is one of those things that you may

1581
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:14,880
not be paying a lot of attention to but

1582
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:17,199
the buffer ph may be critically

1583
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:19,119
important and that's really how much

1584
00:52:17,199 --> 00:52:20,480
abuse your soil can take before the ph

1585
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:22,480
is going to move

1586
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:24,639
um so if you have a wide spread in your

1587
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:26,719
buffer ph you you're you're not going to

1588
00:52:24,639 --> 00:52:27,759
be able to move it very far with any

1589
00:52:26,719 --> 00:52:29,199
inputs

1590
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:30,079
and a lot of times those inputs are

1591
00:52:29,199 --> 00:52:31,279
going to get to the point where they're

1592
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:33,039
going to be

1593
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:35,680
tying up other nutrients or causing

1594
00:52:33,039 --> 00:52:37,599
plant toxicity or you know emergence

1595
00:52:35,679 --> 00:52:40,318
issues or root growth issues because it

1596
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:42,880
takes so much of that thing to

1597
00:52:40,318 --> 00:52:44,880
chemically change the ph of your soil if

1598
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:47,039
you have the ability you might be better

1599
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:48,720
off changing your media

1600
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:50,800
to something a little bit different or

1601
00:52:48,719 --> 00:52:52,639
adding some other type of media base

1602
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:54,240
maybe it's more vermiculite or some

1603
00:52:52,639 --> 00:52:56,480
other type of bentonite or some other

1604
00:52:54,239 --> 00:52:58,558
type of clay to help

1605
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:01,119
trap some of those ions

1606
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:02,400
those and and to change your ph a little

1607
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:04,000
bit that way

1608
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:06,000
but uh the

1609
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,440
solution is probably the easiest way to

1610
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,039
do that

1611
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:10,400
now i haven't seen

1612
00:53:09,039 --> 00:53:12,639
uh

1613
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:15,358
sulfur toxicity with with cannabis

1614
00:53:12,639 --> 00:53:17,279
specifically are you seeing

1615
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:19,679
excessive sulfur really being an issue

1616
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:20,720
with other crops i mean again i'm not

1617
00:53:19,679 --> 00:53:23,440
adding

1618
00:53:20,719 --> 00:53:24,719
uh you know high concentrations

1619
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:26,639
every cycle

1620
00:53:24,719 --> 00:53:29,039
um and you know a cycle for us would be

1621
00:53:26,639 --> 00:53:31,519
two to three months but we're adding a

1622
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:33,358
little bit and slowly over time lowering

1623
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:34,800
the the ph

1624
00:53:33,358 --> 00:53:37,119
yeah well then you're you're doing it

1625
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:38,880
really well uh no what i'm talking about

1626
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:40,240
in our agricultural so we have a lot of

1627
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:41,760
high ph cells we have some stuff that

1628
00:53:40,239 --> 00:53:42,558
gets up in that eight five eight eight

1629
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,480
range

1630
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:47,040
and they've done research on it for here

1631
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:48,960
and and and we're talking about you know

1632
00:53:47,039 --> 00:53:51,759
per acre uh beyond the order of

1633
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:53,519
elemental sulfur now five tons per acre

1634
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:54,480
which is just this ridiculous amount of

1635
00:53:53,519 --> 00:53:57,599
sulfur

1636
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:59,760
yeah it can move the ph a little bit but

1637
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:01,680
the buffer ph kicks back in in a few

1638
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:04,160
years it kind of bounces back

1639
00:54:01,679 --> 00:54:06,960
so it's become not only economically

1640
00:54:04,159 --> 00:54:07,920
unviable but that level of sulfur is

1641
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,920
just

1642
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:11,200
excessive to the point that it retards

1643
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:12,880
plant growth

1644
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:14,399
um so

1645
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:17,440
if you're doing it with your solution

1646
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:19,280
over time with your nutrient balances

1647
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:20,800
and you're maybe maybe you're giving it

1648
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:22,160
just a little extra kick once a while to

1649
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:24,079
try to do that then i think you're being

1650
00:54:22,159 --> 00:54:26,078
very successful

1651
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:27,920
the other thing is you know and i don't

1652
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:30,240
know i this is again a little bit aside

1653
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:32,480
my parameters is that you know saturated

1654
00:54:30,239 --> 00:54:35,439
calcium solutions can help

1655
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:37,519
change some things sometimes too or or

1656
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:39,358
just a high leaching like leaching your

1657
00:54:37,519 --> 00:54:41,039
soils may

1658
00:54:39,358 --> 00:54:42,798
may move something for you but that's

1659
00:54:41,039 --> 00:54:44,639
that's a guess and so i shouldn't even

1660
00:54:42,798 --> 00:54:47,759
say that

1661
00:54:44,639 --> 00:54:50,879
yeah we've used leaching for nitrates

1662
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:54,720
uh potassium sodium you know some of

1663
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:56,559
those more mobile nutrients and soils

1664
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:58,159
and had good success with that you know

1665
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:59,760
some of our guys will even just reset

1666
00:54:58,159 --> 00:55:01,920
their beds by

1667
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:03,680
you know watering leaching through them

1668
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:05,358
a specific amount of water and then that

1669
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:07,598
allows them to put a

1670
00:55:05,358 --> 00:55:09,838
you know the same

1671
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:11,920
nutrient load back into the soil kind of

1672
00:55:09,838 --> 00:55:13,759
giving you a reset close to zero and

1673
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:16,480
that's that's worked well for some for

1674
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:18,319
some growers that i work with but um

1675
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:20,639
yeah i i see what you're saying so how

1676
00:55:18,318 --> 00:55:22,480
do you what do you do if you're you know

1677
00:55:20,639 --> 00:55:24,719
in actual soil

1678
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:25,679
you have a ph of let's say seven five or

1679
00:55:24,719 --> 00:55:26,719
higher

1680
00:55:25,679 --> 00:55:28,719
um

1681
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:30,558
how do you begin to manage a crop on

1682
00:55:28,719 --> 00:55:33,039
land like that

1683
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:34,880
so we actually have gone to the point of

1684
00:55:33,039 --> 00:55:36,480
we're using some chelated nutrients so

1685
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:38,318
the the most

1686
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:39,519
problematic situation when we have high

1687
00:55:38,318 --> 00:55:41,759
ph

1688
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:43,440
is we're going to have iron availability

1689
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:44,480
issues now and our soils are made on a

1690
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:46,639
wire like it's one of the main

1691
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:48,318
constituents but when you have a high ph

1692
00:55:46,639 --> 00:55:50,480
this causes that in availability the

1693
00:55:48,318 --> 00:55:52,318
iron becomes inavailable and one of the

1694
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:54,318
most susceptible crops we will grow is

1695
00:55:52,318 --> 00:55:55,838
soybeans you'll see iron chlorotic

1696
00:55:54,318 --> 00:55:56,960
soybeans it's called iron deficiency

1697
00:55:55,838 --> 00:55:58,719
chlorosis

1698
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:01,199
and it's related to the high ph of that

1699
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:03,679
soil and also the water content

1700
00:56:01,199 --> 00:56:06,318
but really the answer there is if you

1701
00:56:03,679 --> 00:56:07,440
have significant iron problems in your

1702
00:56:06,318 --> 00:56:09,920
soybean

1703
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:11,599
you can try a chelated nutrient which is

1704
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:13,599
you know instead of

1705
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:15,440
that iron being attracted to the soil

1706
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:16,880
particles we have a chelate that fills

1707
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:18,720
all three sites

1708
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:20,798
and it's organic chelate and basically

1709
00:56:18,719 --> 00:56:22,639
it makes it more available to the plant

1710
00:56:20,798 --> 00:56:24,880
but if you have a significant issue the

1711
00:56:22,639 --> 00:56:27,279
answer is don't grow soybean

1712
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:29,039
that is literally the right answer so

1713
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:31,839
it's one of those things where you just

1714
00:56:29,039 --> 00:56:34,719
have to you reach a point where

1715
00:56:31,838 --> 00:56:36,078
okay we can change some things

1716
00:56:34,719 --> 00:56:38,000
but there's a lot of things that simply

1717
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:39,519
are not worth the expense to try to do

1718
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,119
it because these chelated nutrients are

1719
00:56:39,519 --> 00:56:43,119
extremely expensive

1720
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:44,960
and we need them at a really high rate

1721
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:47,920
at those high ph's

1722
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:49,280
and then they're not long-term stable so

1723
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:51,039
it's not like we can build it up over

1724
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:53,440
time it's just for that season or even

1725
00:56:51,039 --> 00:56:55,440
part of that season and it really isn't

1726
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:58,559
isn't cost effective to do it so the

1727
00:56:55,440 --> 00:57:00,639
answer is to grow a more tolerant crop

1728
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:02,240
so that's really the answer yeah so you

1729
00:57:00,639 --> 00:57:04,480
said you're not really measuring water

1730
00:57:02,239 --> 00:57:07,118
how often do you find water see like in

1731
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:08,960
our area here we'll find

1732
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:10,400
in some cases to be pretty alkaline

1733
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:12,720
water or you know dealing with farmers

1734
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:15,519
in oklahoma they have some really bad

1735
00:57:12,719 --> 00:57:17,598
water um you know sodium or calcium or

1736
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:18,400
even iron in some cases

1737
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:19,280
uh

1738
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:22,318
great

1739
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:24,880
do you you find that it doesn't really

1740
00:57:22,318 --> 00:57:25,599
factor in on the scale no control over

1741
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:27,838
it

1742
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:29,599
oh you can't filter it i don't use it

1743
00:57:27,838 --> 00:57:31,199
no i can't filter it and i don't use

1744
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:33,200
irrigation

1745
00:57:31,199 --> 00:57:34,480
we're all natural rainfall

1746
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:36,480
so it's one of those things it's not

1747
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:38,400
that it's unimportant i simply have no

1748
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:39,838
control over it so i think that might be

1749
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:41,200
the same thing as your ph is like it

1750
00:57:39,838 --> 00:57:42,558
doesn't matter

1751
00:57:41,199 --> 00:57:44,480
we can't do anything about it or it

1752
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:47,920
doesn't matter and for us i literally

1753
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:50,480
can't affect it um i have two fields

1754
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:52,639
that have irrigation pivots and

1755
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:54,559
and we can only manage them a certain

1756
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:56,558
way because they're on off-peak electric

1757
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:57,839
and we either they tell us when we can

1758
00:57:56,559 --> 00:57:58,880
print them on and when we can't turn

1759
00:57:57,838 --> 00:58:00,239
them on

1760
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:01,519
and so we run them as much as we can

1761
00:58:00,239 --> 00:58:03,519
when we need them and that's that's the

1762
00:58:01,519 --> 00:58:05,679
only thing we can do and overall the

1763
00:58:03,519 --> 00:58:08,400
water quality in north dakota is decent

1764
00:58:05,679 --> 00:58:10,639
we tend to have high calcium

1765
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:13,119
and high sulfates because again we have

1766
00:58:10,639 --> 00:58:14,719
higher ph's we have fairly young soils

1767
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:15,760
that have a lot of those nutrients in

1768
00:58:14,719 --> 00:58:17,838
them

1769
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:19,280
so that would be our water quality but

1770
00:58:17,838 --> 00:58:22,159
our water quality is pretty good and

1771
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:24,160
most of our water is very potable easily

1772
00:58:22,159 --> 00:58:26,078
drinkable water and so it's it's good

1773
00:58:24,159 --> 00:58:26,960
for plants we're not carrying a bunch of

1774
00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:28,480
dangerous things like what you're

1775
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:29,760
talking about within oklahoma i can

1776
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:31,358
totally see that

1777
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:32,799
that there could be lots of things in

1778
00:58:31,358 --> 00:58:33,838
the water that can be problematic for

1779
00:58:32,798 --> 00:58:36,559
plants

1780
00:58:33,838 --> 00:58:38,318
yeah and you also mentioned um

1781
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:40,480
you know aluminum as you get to a lower

1782
00:58:38,318 --> 00:58:42,558
ph that's the other concern is uh the

1783
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:45,519
testing on heavy metals in some of these

1784
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:48,880
states for cannabis is uh pretty pretty

1785
00:58:45,519 --> 00:58:50,400
strict and so eliminating

1786
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:52,880
you know heavy metal availability or

1787
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:54,480
filtering it out of any you know sources

1788
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:55,920
whether it's water or fertilizer is

1789
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:56,960
really critical

1790
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:58,480
um

1791
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:59,920
but you know i want to get into zinc

1792
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:00,719
because that's something that i haven't

1793
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:02,159
done

1794
00:59:00,719 --> 00:59:04,879
you know i know very little about i

1795
00:59:02,159 --> 00:59:06,719
haven't done much research on

1796
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:08,400
i'd be curious to hear

1797
00:59:06,719 --> 00:59:11,439
why you mentioned it as a macronutrient

1798
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:13,920
and the importance of it

1799
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:15,760
so zinc in a lot of plants is related to

1800
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:18,720
the reproductive system it's used as a

1801
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:20,720
co enzyme in a lot of scenarios but it's

1802
00:59:18,719 --> 00:59:23,039
critically important for reproduction

1803
00:59:20,719 --> 00:59:24,239
flower set flower fertility and

1804
00:59:23,039 --> 00:59:26,639
pollination

1805
00:59:24,239 --> 00:59:28,558
um so it's it's it's not necessarily

1806
00:59:26,639 --> 00:59:30,480
used at a high level but it's super

1807
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:32,640
important for those types of things and

1808
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:34,480
we see it in several crops in north

1809
00:59:32,639 --> 00:59:36,480
dakota where zinc deficiency is a

1810
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:39,039
significant yield problem

1811
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:41,358
corn would be one dry edible bean or you

1812
00:59:39,039 --> 00:59:43,679
know pintos would be another and then

1813
00:59:41,358 --> 00:59:46,000
alfalfa is the third one that

1814
00:59:43,679 --> 00:59:48,000
they all respond really well to small

1815
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:50,880
levels of zinc

1816
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:52,400
and just the way the zinc is it it

1817
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:53,440
combines with several things it has

1818
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:56,240
several

1819
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:57,599
sites and so our typical way of

1820
00:59:56,239 --> 00:59:59,358
placing zinc is actually with a

1821
00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:01,359
phosphorus fertilizer

1822
00:59:59,358 --> 01:00:03,598
and zinc loves to attach to phosphates

1823
01:00:01,358 --> 01:00:05,279
so again we use that chelated zinc

1824
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:07,359
which is protecting it from that

1825
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:08,720
phosphorus then we can use a lower rate

1826
01:00:07,358 --> 01:00:10,400
and we'll put that right in furrow right

1827
01:00:08,719 --> 01:00:12,480
next to the corn seed or the dry bean

1828
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:14,639
seed within a few inches so that that

1829
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:15,599
young seedling gets into this zinc early

1830
01:00:14,639 --> 01:00:17,838
on

1831
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:20,798
and then that zinc will help with it

1832
01:00:17,838 --> 01:00:23,119
helps with photosys photosynthesis and

1833
01:00:20,798 --> 01:00:25,199
this is why you'll see white or yellow

1834
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:27,358
coloring if you have a zinc deficiency

1835
01:00:25,199 --> 01:00:29,519
is it it's a coenzyme for photosynthesis

1836
01:00:27,358 --> 01:00:31,119
but it's also a core enzyme for all that

1837
01:00:29,519 --> 01:00:32,880
reproduction so when you're growing seed

1838
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:35,200
or you're growing flower parts or

1839
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:37,440
whatever it can be critically important

1840
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:40,558
and high ph will be very very

1841
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:41,519
problematic for zinc availability

1842
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:43,280
so

1843
01:00:41,519 --> 01:00:44,960
can you give me a specific product i

1844
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:47,920
mean when you say zinc i immediately

1845
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:50,159
think of zinc sulfate um are there other

1846
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:52,400
ways or other products

1847
01:00:50,159 --> 01:00:54,480
that are chelated yeah there's a

1848
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:56,559
liquid chelated zinc it's a nine percent

1849
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:58,480
zinc i'm trying to think of

1850
01:00:56,559 --> 01:01:00,079
specifically what it's called i don't

1851
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:02,079
have it off top of my head but it's a

1852
01:01:00,079 --> 01:01:04,400
liquid formula zinc

1853
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:05,760
that's an organic approved

1854
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:09,039
kiwi i don't know if you're familiar

1855
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:10,160
with bio-men they do a

1856
01:01:09,039 --> 01:01:12,159
they make a product like that

1857
01:01:10,159 --> 01:01:13,838
essentially so i know there's ones out

1858
01:01:12,159 --> 01:01:17,039
there but that doesn't get

1859
01:01:13,838 --> 01:01:19,039
you know ineffective uh price wise

1860
01:01:17,039 --> 01:01:20,639
using it would for you yes because

1861
01:01:19,039 --> 01:01:23,119
you're zinc sulfate it's highly soluble

1862
01:01:20,639 --> 01:01:25,679
and if you're using in a in a drench or

1863
01:01:23,119 --> 01:01:27,760
a liquid irrigation chemigation or

1864
01:01:25,679 --> 01:01:30,078
fertigation type of thing you're way

1865
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:31,839
better off using zinc sulfate like that

1866
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:35,119
would be the way to do it

1867
01:01:31,838 --> 01:01:37,599
but why don't we put in yeah sorry we're

1868
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:39,119
putting it with the uh fertilizer so the

1869
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:41,200
zinc sulfate's coming in as a granular

1870
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:43,358
form yeah and the fertilizers that we're

1871
01:01:41,199 --> 01:01:44,879
using are liquid fertilizers

1872
01:01:43,358 --> 01:01:47,838
and but they're oil based liquid

1873
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:49,358
fertilizers so the zinc goes in with

1874
01:01:47,838 --> 01:01:51,519
liquids we're putting a quart of zinc

1875
01:01:49,358 --> 01:01:52,719
per acre it's a very low rate there's

1876
01:01:51,519 --> 01:01:54,159
another reason why we put it with a

1877
01:01:52,719 --> 01:01:56,159
phosphorus because the phosphorus is

1878
01:01:54,159 --> 01:01:57,838
coming out at five gallons and that's

1879
01:01:56,159 --> 01:01:59,679
that's actually a consistent stream in

1880
01:01:57,838 --> 01:02:02,078
the equipment because if you try to put

1881
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:03,679
a quart per acre like you have a dot

1882
01:02:02,079 --> 01:02:05,519
here and a dot there and

1883
01:02:03,679 --> 01:02:06,960
20 feet further you have another dot

1884
01:02:05,519 --> 01:02:08,318
right so that's not really good for

1885
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:10,000
availability

1886
01:02:08,318 --> 01:02:12,159
so this is why we're putting it into a

1887
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,679
starter right near the seed band and

1888
01:02:12,159 --> 01:02:15,598
we're putting it with a higher volume

1889
01:02:13,679 --> 01:02:18,000
thing so that we get it spread out so

1890
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:19,519
that every seed gets a chance at it

1891
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,400
and

1892
01:02:19,519 --> 01:02:22,000
then

1893
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:24,079
it doesn't take a whole lot but it needs

1894
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:25,838
to be highly available so this chelation

1895
01:02:24,079 --> 01:02:27,359
process is expensive

1896
01:02:25,838 --> 01:02:29,440
but it helps maintain it because

1897
01:02:27,358 --> 01:02:31,440
phosphorus will grab onto zinc in a

1898
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:34,559
split second and tie it up and it

1899
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:36,639
becomes a rock and it won't dissolve

1900
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:38,480
so we're using it that way and it also

1901
01:02:36,639 --> 01:02:40,000
protects our zinc from our high ph

1902
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:42,880
chemistries

1903
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:44,639
so we're isolating it in a band and

1904
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:45,680
we're keeping it away from a bunch of

1905
01:02:44,639 --> 01:02:47,838
chemistry

1906
01:02:45,679 --> 01:02:49,919
we do use zinc sulfate we'll broadcast

1907
01:02:47,838 --> 01:02:51,599
that on on land and we'll do that that's

1908
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:53,599
a once every three or four years deal

1909
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:55,599
because we use a high rate and then it

1910
01:02:53,599 --> 01:02:56,798
will it will last for three four five

1911
01:02:55,599 --> 01:02:58,798
years

1912
01:02:56,798 --> 01:03:00,639
um but the the consistency of the

1913
01:02:58,798 --> 01:03:02,559
product it's a granule right it's not a

1914
01:03:00,639 --> 01:03:03,838
pelletized most egg

1915
01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:05,680
fertilizers that i'm dealing with are

1916
01:03:03,838 --> 01:03:08,000
pelletized so they're

1917
01:03:05,679 --> 01:03:10,879
several orders larger than the granular

1918
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:12,639
so it just becomes a logistics issue

1919
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:14,079
when you're using this very fine granule

1920
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:15,358
it's harder to spread it over wider

1921
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:16,480
distances because these spreaders are

1922
01:03:15,358 --> 01:03:19,119
trying to cover

1923
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:20,559
40 feet for the spinner spreader

1924
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:21,599
and a small particle just doesn't fly

1925
01:03:20,559 --> 01:03:23,440
that far

1926
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:24,880
so when you're saying granular

1927
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:27,358
you're describing like almost like a

1928
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:30,318
powder just for listeners

1929
01:03:27,358 --> 01:03:31,119
a little bit above a powder yeah yeah so

1930
01:03:30,318 --> 01:03:32,000
this

1931
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:33,358
and then when i'm talking about

1932
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:36,000
pelletize i'm talking about something

1933
01:03:33,358 --> 01:03:38,239
the size of a bb or bigger okay you know

1934
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:40,000
so the pellets are larger and have more

1935
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:42,239
density and they'll fly farther the

1936
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:44,400
granule would be one-tenth the size of a

1937
01:03:42,239 --> 01:03:46,399
bb and then a powder is going to be very

1938
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:47,838
fine and so

1939
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:48,720
your zinc sulfate you're getting is

1940
01:03:47,838 --> 01:03:50,639
going to be a powder because it

1941
01:03:48,719 --> 01:03:52,318
dissolves easily in water yeah that's

1942
01:03:50,639 --> 01:03:53,679
what i'm familiar with

1943
01:03:52,318 --> 01:03:55,759
yeah that would be that'll be the way to

1944
01:03:53,679 --> 01:03:57,919
do it we're getting a liquid base of

1945
01:03:55,760 --> 01:04:00,640
zinc sulfate and it's got a chelation

1946
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:02,159
agent in there and so basically the the

1947
01:04:00,639 --> 01:04:03,519
zinc is dissolved in the liquid with a

1948
01:04:02,159 --> 01:04:04,480
chelating agent

1949
01:04:03,519 --> 01:04:06,480
and

1950
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:08,240
that's really what it is i mean it's

1951
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:09,440
it's so here i just looked it up it's

1952
01:04:08,239 --> 01:04:10,479
derived from zinc chloride and zinc

1953
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:13,679
sulfate

1954
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:14,960
and we're adding a human component to

1955
01:04:13,679 --> 01:04:16,078
chelate

1956
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:17,599
and so basically we're adding a little

1957
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:19,440
bit of cep

1958
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:22,079
that so that was actually when you said

1959
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:23,679
chelation my brain went to hemic acids

1960
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:25,119
and then i was like oh do i have time to

1961
01:04:23,679 --> 01:04:27,199
ask you one last question about your

1962
01:04:25,119 --> 01:04:29,519
thoughts about humic acids because it's

1963
01:04:27,199 --> 01:04:31,199
kind of a contentious

1964
01:04:29,519 --> 01:04:32,639
topic i feel like in the ag world a

1965
01:04:31,199 --> 01:04:33,838
little bit yeah

1966
01:04:32,639 --> 01:04:35,759
it is it can

1967
01:04:33,838 --> 01:04:37,838
so see here's the thing

1968
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:39,520
so the humic acids are part of the the

1969
01:04:37,838 --> 01:04:41,199
cec right and if you have a really

1970
01:04:39,519 --> 01:04:43,679
really low cec

1971
01:04:41,199 --> 01:04:46,000
you could have amazing results

1972
01:04:43,679 --> 01:04:47,759
if you have a moderate to high cec

1973
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,920
you're going to see nothing

1974
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:52,640
because its percentage of

1975
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:53,760
change is not enough when we're talking

1976
01:04:52,639 --> 01:04:55,920
courts or

1977
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:58,559
gallons per acre even i mean

1978
01:04:55,920 --> 01:05:00,318
one inch of rainfall is 27 000 gallons

1979
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:01,839
of water per acre

1980
01:05:00,318 --> 01:05:03,199
so when you start talking about five

1981
01:05:01,838 --> 01:05:05,920
gallons an acre even you're talking

1982
01:05:03,199 --> 01:05:08,480
about micro percentages but if you have

1983
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:10,720
a highly sandy soil or something with a

1984
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:12,400
very low nutrient holding capacity and

1985
01:05:10,719 --> 01:05:14,719
you add a little bit of a chelating

1986
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:16,400
agent which is a human component

1987
01:05:14,719 --> 01:05:18,959
you're going to see that your nutrient

1988
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:21,280
availability jumps drastically in

1989
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:23,039
proportion to what you're doing

1990
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:25,280
for us we have

1991
01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:28,160
very good clay soils a lot of silt we

1992
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:30,160
have a high cec normally we have

1993
01:05:28,159 --> 01:05:32,159
decent organic matters two to four

1994
01:05:30,159 --> 01:05:34,480
percent for us is pretty decent so we

1995
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:37,118
have pretty good cec so when we add a

1996
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:39,519
little bit of humic components it moved

1997
01:05:37,119 --> 01:05:40,960
the needle 0.5 percent well we're not

1998
01:05:39,519 --> 01:05:42,798
going to notice that

1999
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:44,559
if you go to a sand soil in some of the

2000
01:05:42,798 --> 01:05:45,599
coastal areas you go to florida or

2001
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:47,440
california or something like that

2002
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:49,280
there's almost a pure sand

2003
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:52,000
and they add a little bit of humic

2004
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:53,760
it has 10 times as much nutrient holding

2005
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:56,000
capacity as the soil did so then they

2006
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:57,359
see this huge benefit so this is where

2007
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,960
the details matter what are you trying

2008
01:05:57,358 --> 01:06:00,239
to do where you're at what problem are

2009
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:03,280
you trying to solve is it the right

2010
01:06:00,239 --> 01:06:03,279
solution for your problem

2011
01:06:03,358 --> 01:06:07,679
that's interesting because uh a lot of

2012
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:10,798
the you know with potting soils we have

2013
01:06:07,679 --> 01:06:12,078
a fairly high cc high very high organic

2014
01:06:10,798 --> 01:06:14,239
matter percentage you know off the

2015
01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:15,440
charts compared to what you're used to

2016
01:06:14,239 --> 01:06:17,439
um right

2017
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:20,798
i haven't gotten the same results from

2018
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:23,519
humic acids that i would have expected

2019
01:06:20,798 --> 01:06:24,639
or would have liked to see

2020
01:06:23,519 --> 01:06:27,038
um

2021
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:28,960
in some of those systems so yeah that's

2022
01:06:27,039 --> 01:06:30,240
that's just dangerous

2023
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:31,679
yeah

2024
01:06:30,239 --> 01:06:33,279
this is like taking an aspirin when you

2025
01:06:31,679 --> 01:06:35,038
don't have a headache i mean if you have

2026
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:36,319
a heart condition fine but it you know

2027
01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:38,319
if you don't need it you don't need it

2028
01:06:36,318 --> 01:06:41,199
this is the details part

2029
01:06:38,318 --> 01:06:42,639
and and it so the next thing on that so

2030
01:06:41,199 --> 01:06:44,078
you can have all of those things you can

2031
01:06:42,639 --> 01:06:46,239
have very high organic matter you can

2032
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:47,599
have very high cec you can have very

2033
01:06:46,239 --> 01:06:50,719
high neutral capacity but if you're

2034
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:52,240
flushing a lot of water through this

2035
01:06:50,719 --> 01:06:53,919
then you might see a difference if you

2036
01:06:52,239 --> 01:06:55,598
added the humid component to your

2037
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:58,639
solution simply because it's going to

2038
01:06:55,599 --> 01:07:00,160
hold the nutrients in the water better

2039
01:06:58,639 --> 01:07:01,920
so that could be some of the variable

2040
01:07:00,159 --> 01:07:03,759
results is this this again goes back to

2041
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:05,280
the different places like somebody's

2042
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:06,160
flushing a ton of water through

2043
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:08,000
something

2044
01:07:06,159 --> 01:07:09,358
for some other reason to try to manage

2045
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,480
the ph

2046
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:12,000
and they add a little bit of human

2047
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:13,599
components they see the benefit and the

2048
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,880
next guy is not flushing near as much

2049
01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:16,480
water and he has the immediate when he

2050
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:17,680
sees nothing or he sees a negative

2051
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:19,280
response

2052
01:07:17,679 --> 01:07:21,440
well this is simply you didn't need

2053
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:24,640
aspirin

2054
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:26,079
yeah i i think it is situational and um

2055
01:07:24,639 --> 01:07:28,400
as you probably experienced this in the

2056
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:30,798
ag industry but this idea

2057
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:32,400
that there's always another product out

2058
01:07:30,798 --> 01:07:33,920
there or another thing that's going to

2059
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:36,960
be that amazing

2060
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:36,960
difference in my crop

2061
01:07:37,199 --> 01:07:40,960
you know people don't necessarily look

2062
01:07:39,039 --> 01:07:44,319
at nitrogen as nitrogen they look at

2063
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:45,199
this brand or that brand or

2064
01:07:44,318 --> 01:07:47,759
this

2065
01:07:45,199 --> 01:07:49,358
you know potential form of it

2066
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:51,200
and i think sometimes we move a little

2067
01:07:49,358 --> 01:07:54,960
too far away from

2068
01:07:51,199 --> 01:07:54,960
just looking at the chemistry itself

2069
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:58,240
and there's just so many marketing

2070
01:07:56,639 --> 01:07:59,759
claims out there and and frankly the

2071
01:07:58,239 --> 01:08:01,279
cannabis industry is even worse than the

2072
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:03,119
ag industry in this regard i wouldn't

2073
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:04,798
believe it yeah i don't believe it it

2074
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:05,838
becomes very hard to evaluate a product

2075
01:08:04,798 --> 01:08:07,519
and know what's going to work in your

2076
01:08:05,838 --> 01:08:09,440
system which is gets back to your whole

2077
01:08:07,519 --> 01:08:10,480
science thing and how it's so important

2078
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:14,400
that we

2079
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:15,440
you know use experimental design in our

2080
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:17,199
um

2081
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:19,119
you know in our in our own

2082
01:08:17,198 --> 01:08:21,119
field

2083
01:08:19,119 --> 01:08:23,759
make sure you have replication make sure

2084
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:26,238
you have checks and balances on this you

2085
01:08:23,759 --> 01:08:28,000
know the the non-treated check is

2086
01:08:26,238 --> 01:08:30,718
critically important

2087
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:32,719
but uh yeah

2088
01:08:30,719 --> 01:08:34,319
so one of the things is just under you

2089
01:08:32,719 --> 01:08:35,920
know think about plants again when you

2090
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:38,239
when you get all these wonderful claims

2091
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:39,920
these amazing i call them the snake oils

2092
01:08:38,238 --> 01:08:42,079
right all these things that are just

2093
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:43,759
going to save and fix everything that do

2094
01:08:42,079 --> 01:08:45,838
all these wonderful things

2095
01:08:43,759 --> 01:08:48,079
there's a potential possibly in certain

2096
01:08:45,838 --> 01:08:49,600
situations but i want people to think

2097
01:08:48,079 --> 01:08:52,399
about what a plant needs and what a

2098
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:54,000
plant does when a plant uses for me

2099
01:08:52,399 --> 01:08:56,798
there was a big push for a while about

2100
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:59,679
using sugars in in plant production

2101
01:08:56,798 --> 01:09:02,238
adding sugar as a as a nutrient

2102
01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:03,359
that's just absolutely counterintuitive

2103
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:06,158
that's the whole process of

2104
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:07,759
photosynthesis is to take carbon dioxide

2105
01:09:06,158 --> 01:09:09,358
and water and to make sugar this is what

2106
01:09:07,759 --> 01:09:11,920
a plant does

2107
01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:14,000
it's it's byproduct it's sugar so adding

2108
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:15,759
sugar to a plant doesn't make any sense

2109
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:17,359
because it's what a plant does

2110
01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:19,600
and when we talk about nutrients in

2111
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:22,000
particular we talk about nitrogen

2112
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:23,520
we we know that plants only assume a

2113
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,798
couple forms of nitrogen they're

2114
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:27,040
basically elemental forms they're

2115
01:09:24,798 --> 01:09:28,719
nitrate and they're ammonia

2116
01:09:27,039 --> 01:09:30,798
and that's what plants assume is ammonia

2117
01:09:28,719 --> 01:09:32,480
and nitrate that's what they bring up

2118
01:09:30,798 --> 01:09:34,560
so as long as your fertilizer turns into

2119
01:09:32,479 --> 01:09:35,919
that it's plant available

2120
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:38,560
i don't care if it came out of the back

2121
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:41,199
end of a sheep or it came out of the

2122
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:42,798
haber bosch process or it came out of

2123
01:09:41,198 --> 01:09:44,238
nitrogen fixation through bacteria as

2124
01:09:42,798 --> 01:09:45,119
long as it's in that form the plants

2125
01:09:44,238 --> 01:09:46,639
happen

2126
01:09:45,119 --> 01:09:48,719
because the plant takes these elemental

2127
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:51,199
forms and builds the things that

2128
01:09:48,719 --> 01:09:52,798
that other organisms like us need from

2129
01:09:51,198 --> 01:09:53,838
eating that plant we need the proteins

2130
01:09:52,798 --> 01:09:55,519
and we need

2131
01:09:53,838 --> 01:09:57,279
the sugars and the carbohydrates and all

2132
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:58,719
that type of stuff

2133
01:09:57,279 --> 01:10:00,238
because we can't build them the plants

2134
01:09:58,719 --> 01:10:02,960
literally build them so all we got to do

2135
01:10:00,238 --> 01:10:04,959
is give them the lego blocks so honestly

2136
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:06,319
as long as it's a four by four lego

2137
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:07,840
block it doesn't matter if it's yellow

2138
01:10:06,319 --> 01:10:09,519
or blue or green or red the plant

2139
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:10,800
doesn't care it'll use it to build what

2140
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:13,520
it needs

2141
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:15,679
so that's that's my short answer to all

2142
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:18,800
of these wonderful claims about

2143
01:10:15,679 --> 01:10:20,158
this is you know ortho this and paulie

2144
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:22,079
that and

2145
01:10:20,158 --> 01:10:24,639
it comes from such and such whatever as

2146
01:10:22,079 --> 01:10:27,119
long as it turns into the plant

2147
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:29,840
ions that they need it's simple and

2148
01:10:27,119 --> 01:10:31,760
phosphorus is the same thing it's h2po4

2149
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:33,279
and it's hpo4 that's it those are the

2150
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:34,719
two forms of plants absorb phosphorus

2151
01:10:33,279 --> 01:10:36,238
too that's it that's the only things

2152
01:10:34,719 --> 01:10:38,239
they examine

2153
01:10:36,238 --> 01:10:41,039
so that's all it needs to turn into long

2154
01:10:38,238 --> 01:10:42,718
as it does that we're fine

2155
01:10:41,039 --> 01:10:44,479
yeah just real quickly you mentioned

2156
01:10:42,719 --> 01:10:46,239
sugar

2157
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:47,599
could the count argument be that you

2158
01:10:46,238 --> 01:10:49,759
know sugars

2159
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:51,840
would raise the you know bacterial

2160
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:53,520
levels or biological levels in the soil

2161
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:55,360
which may increase nutrient cycling

2162
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:57,520
would that be the

2163
01:10:55,359 --> 01:10:59,519
theory behind it well it'll increase

2164
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:01,199
it'll increase biology but it doesn't

2165
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:03,120
necessarily increase the nitrogen fixing

2166
01:11:01,198 --> 01:11:05,119
biology because that's not the food that

2167
01:11:03,119 --> 01:11:06,800
source that they use

2168
01:11:05,119 --> 01:11:09,519
the nitrobacters

2169
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:12,560
tend to use carbon sources and sulfate

2170
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:14,880
sources to get their oxygen um

2171
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:16,400
and they're getting their nitrogen that

2172
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:18,560
way and that's how they're producing it

2173
01:11:16,399 --> 01:11:21,359
they're using nitrates and then they're

2174
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:24,640
yeah it's they don't need sugar

2175
01:11:21,359 --> 01:11:26,079
some bacteria do but not those ones

2176
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:28,480
yeah you're feeding some bacteria but

2177
01:11:26,079 --> 01:11:30,000
and it goes back to the point of okay so

2178
01:11:28,479 --> 01:11:32,000
how are you getting the food where they

2179
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:33,439
need don't forget that the bacteria is

2180
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:35,600
microscopic and again moving a

2181
01:11:33,439 --> 01:11:37,519
millimeter is a big deal and so if

2182
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:38,960
you're you're broadcasting the sugar

2183
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:40,800
solution on top of your soil is it

2184
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:42,640
getting to the bacteria because

2185
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:44,400
it's like applying

2186
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:45,920
you know dropping a fruit basket in

2187
01:11:44,399 --> 01:11:47,439
russia and hoping the guys in iowa are

2188
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:49,279
going to get it

2189
01:11:47,439 --> 01:11:50,559
it's just not going to happen and

2190
01:11:49,279 --> 01:11:51,519
they're going to get it before somebody

2191
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:53,199
eats it

2192
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:54,719
so it's going to be intercepted at the

2193
01:11:53,198 --> 01:11:56,319
point of contact and it's going to be

2194
01:11:54,719 --> 01:11:58,960
intercepted within

2195
01:11:56,319 --> 01:12:00,158
nanometers more so than millimeters or

2196
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:01,279
even inches

2197
01:12:00,158 --> 01:12:02,799
and so

2198
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:04,399
i just don't think it's going to get to

2199
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:07,600
where it's going to get to

2200
01:12:04,399 --> 01:12:09,599
now some of these bacteria do trade with

2201
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:10,400
plants for sugar this is this goes back

2202
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:12,400
to

2203
01:12:10,399 --> 01:12:14,079
you know nitrogen fixing bacteria that's

2204
01:12:12,399 --> 01:12:16,479
what they do they trade

2205
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:18,000
um nitrogen for sugar with the plant now

2206
01:12:16,479 --> 01:12:19,198
if you're going to be the guy in the in

2207
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,840
the middle and you're going to give it

2208
01:12:19,198 --> 01:12:22,879
sugar why would it trade

2209
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:25,440
nitrogen like

2210
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:26,719
nature's just as lazy as as the laziest

2211
01:12:25,439 --> 01:12:28,158
human being they're going to take free

2212
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:30,079
every time they can

2213
01:12:28,158 --> 01:12:32,479
so we see this with our legume plants

2214
01:12:30,079 --> 01:12:34,158
that if we give them too much nitrogen

2215
01:12:32,479 --> 01:12:36,238
at planting or early on they don't build

2216
01:12:34,158 --> 01:12:37,519
the associations with the bacteria

2217
01:12:36,238 --> 01:12:39,439
because they get it for free why would

2218
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:41,199
you make an economic trade because

2219
01:12:39,439 --> 01:12:43,759
that's plants build sugars and they

2220
01:12:41,198 --> 01:12:45,119
trade it they buy nitrogen with sugar

2221
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:46,719
and when we give them too much nitrogen

2222
01:12:45,119 --> 01:12:48,719
they don't buy any

2223
01:12:46,719 --> 01:12:50,158
nitrogen with sugar so then when they

2224
01:12:48,719 --> 01:12:51,439
run out of what we supply then they're

2225
01:12:50,158 --> 01:12:53,519
in short supply they've got to build the

2226
01:12:51,439 --> 01:12:55,039
factories we see this is this is a

2227
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:55,920
biological fact

2228
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:57,920
so

2229
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:59,520
i i'm just saying

2230
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:01,199
have a healthy soil

2231
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:04,000
do a good job of maintaining managing

2232
01:13:01,198 --> 01:13:05,839
your plants and the biology below is for

2233
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:08,158
the most part gonna kind of take care of

2234
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:08,159
itself

2235
01:13:08,479 --> 01:13:11,439
one

2236
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:13,360
last question saying this but you

2237
01:13:11,439 --> 01:13:15,599
mentioned that the nitrobacters don't

2238
01:13:13,359 --> 01:13:16,719
they they primarily use carbon but then

2239
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:19,600
they also

2240
01:13:16,719 --> 01:13:21,439
receive sugar from the plant there

2241
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:24,079
no nitrobacters don't there's different

2242
01:13:21,439 --> 01:13:26,399
ones oh other nitrogen

2243
01:13:24,079 --> 01:13:28,000
nitrogen producing bacteria is that what

2244
01:13:26,399 --> 01:13:29,519
you were

2245
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:32,079
that was a little yeah there's just so

2246
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:33,600
many different bacteria groups i i got

2247
01:13:32,079 --> 01:13:35,039
my words a little jumbled the

2248
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:36,320
nitrobacter are looking for the carbon

2249
01:13:35,039 --> 01:13:37,279
sources that's what they're looking for

2250
01:13:36,319 --> 01:13:38,960
this is why

2251
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:41,519
you know and the carbon source is often

2252
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:43,600
sugar right it is because it's what it

2253
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:45,040
is c6h12o6

2254
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:46,960
that's sugar that's really what you're

2255
01:13:45,039 --> 01:13:49,439
talking about is carbon

2256
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:51,760
but um they're getting it from so many

2257
01:13:49,439 --> 01:13:54,238
sources there's

2258
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:56,079
it's just all over the place sometimes

2259
01:13:54,238 --> 01:13:58,639
you can even taste soil it has a

2260
01:13:56,079 --> 01:14:01,279
sweetness to it there's just so much

2261
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:02,000
potential out there that adding a little

2262
01:14:01,279 --> 01:14:03,759
bit

2263
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:06,000
agriculturally is

2264
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:07,600
that's like eating a pinch of sugar and

2265
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,520
calling it your food for the day it's

2266
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:10,960
not enough

2267
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:12,480
got it you got it yeah i just wanted a

2268
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:15,840
little clarification clarification there

2269
01:14:12,479 --> 01:14:15,839
yeah i misspoke

2270
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:21,760
it's all good you know i i think um

2271
01:14:20,079 --> 01:14:23,679
i think it's great that farmers are

2272
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:25,119
trying new things and experimenting and

2273
01:14:23,679 --> 01:14:27,520
learning because i think we have a long

2274
01:14:25,119 --> 01:14:30,079
way to go in this industry like more so

2275
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:30,960
than even most industries out there

2276
01:14:30,079 --> 01:14:32,719
um

2277
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:34,560
but we have to do it intelligently and

2278
01:14:32,719 --> 01:14:36,800
based off of uh

2279
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:38,719
you know a strict scientific model that

2280
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:41,360
that gives us good information for

2281
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:42,399
making decisions on our farm

2282
01:14:41,359 --> 01:14:44,000
right

2283
01:14:42,399 --> 01:14:45,679
i agree

2284
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:47,520
well hey you know i just want to say

2285
01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:49,520
thank you so much lee for your time

2286
