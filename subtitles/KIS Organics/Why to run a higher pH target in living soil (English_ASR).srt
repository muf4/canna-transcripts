00:00:01,318 --> 00:00:06,838
hey so I've done posts in the past about

2
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:09,839
the importance of pH in Organics and

3
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:13,080
organic soil and why uh it's necessary

4
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:15,240
for optimizing plant health and for uh

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,879
optimizing nutrient uptake but today

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,839
what I want to talk about is why I

7
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:21,000
prefer a higher pH Target than you

8
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:23,759
traditionally see so in Hydroponics you

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,679
may aim for 55 to six range uh other

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:30,160
soil companies May aim for like 66 um

11
00:00:27,678 --> 00:00:33,079
and there's that's you know very common

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,119
agronomic Target for actual soils but

13
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:37,719
for what we call living soils these

14
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:40,119
potting soils with cannabis I like to

15
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:43,879
have uh closer to neutral range so my

16
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:45,238
target is 68 and uh this is our soil

17
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:47,039
this is our soil this is the commercial

18
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:49,799
Growers mix which is very similar to our

19
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:52,320
biochar soil I just turned these uh

20
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:53,479
under canopy airflow fan fans off

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,399
because I didn't want the noise while I

22
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:56,759
was recording this video uh but you can

23
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:59,039
see the plants are quite happy they're

24
00:00:56,759 --> 00:01:00,599
just starting to flower in here um and

25
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,640
this is a 68

26
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:06,040
pH so I've seen healthy plants up to

27
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:08,200
like 71 72 but at that point I would

28
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,840
like to start making adjustments to pH

29
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,320
but there's a reason we run a higher pH

30
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,520
so reason number one biggest reason

31
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:16,679
heavy metal uptake so when you get to

32
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:20,399
lower phes you're going to see higher

33
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:23,600
availability and nutrient uptake of um

34
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,880
arsenic lead cadmium and aluminum below

35
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:27,959
55 you'll actually get aluminum toxicity

36
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:29,920
and it'll block phosphorus and

37
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:32,478
availability of other essential minerals

38
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,759
that the plant needs so important to run

39
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:36,438
a higher pH from that perspective um

40
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:38,280
whether it's a regulatory reason because

41
00:01:36,438 --> 00:01:40,199
you're trying to pass in the state or

42
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,840
just for your own health uh we want to

43
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,359
limit the uptake of you know these sorts

44
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,359
of um these sorts of heavy metals so

45
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:51,078
that's reason number one reason number

46
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:54,159
two uh bacteria prefers a very neutral

47
00:01:51,078 --> 00:01:56,199
pH in general so running you know 68 to

48
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:59,240
7 is going to allow for really good

49
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:01,000
growth of M microbial communities in our

50
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:03,399
soil

51
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,280
and um especially with cannabis it

52
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:07,478
really likes to have good high bacterial

53
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,439
levels from what I've seen uh with my

54
00:02:07,478 --> 00:02:11,919
own microscopy and the other research

55
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:14,039
I've seen done by others so uh that's

56
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:17,079
another good reason to run a higher pH

57
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:19,000
and then the last reason is a lot of

58
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:21,319
what I try to do when I'm formulating

59
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,120
soil is cram as much nutrients in there

60
00:02:21,318 --> 00:02:25,919
without getting our soluble salts levels

61
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,439
too high but also stay within optimal PH

62
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:30,238
range and most of the the minerals and

63
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:31,800
nutrients that I want to be adding are

64
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,719
cations which means they have a positive

65
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,160
charge also a lot of the inputs are

66
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:38,120
going to be um are going to be alkaline

67
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:41,280
so things like biochar for example that

68
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:44,000
I want to put into the soil so by having

69
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,640
a higher pH it allows me to put more cat

70
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,878
I into the mix uh which allows me to add

71
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:50,199
more fertility again this is a balancing

72
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:51,759
game we don't want to add so much that

73
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:53,158
we're getting osmotic shock in the root

74
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:55,518
system but we also want to get as much

75
00:02:53,158 --> 00:02:57,120
in there as we can to allow the plant to

76
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,120
have access to it and limit the amount

77
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,280
of touches and other products or inputs

78
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,519
that we're adding throughout the grow

79
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:07,719
cycle so uh here's my room right now uh

80
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:11,120
I haven't added anything but water I did

81
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:12,959
uh one microbial tea and that's it so

82
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,640
far this cycle and I don't have any

83
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,080
plans to add a lot more uh of anything

84
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:19,479
honestly I'm just going to let this run

85
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,560
with water through the rest of the cycle

86
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:25,119
and see what we get

87
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:26,598
so that's my Spiel on ph uh feel free to

88
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,759
leave any comments below with your

89
00:03:26,598 --> 00:03:30,759
thoughts thanks for checking it out
