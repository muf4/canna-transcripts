00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,320
Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and

3
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,640
Science podcast. I'm your host, Tad

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,240
Hussy of Kiss Organics. This is the

5
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,760
podcast where we discuss the cutting

6
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:29,919
edge of growing from a science-based

7
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,279
perspective and draw top experts from

8
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,280
around the industry to share their

9
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:35,039
wisdom and knowledge. Before starting

10
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,558
the podcast, I wanted to share about the

11
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:38,079
cannabis cultivation and science

12
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:39,919
conference that we are hosting in

13
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,079
conjunction with Collective Elevation in

14
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,120
Bosezeman, Montana. The event is

15
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,399
happening on September 5th through 7th,

16
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:48,479
2025. And we are kicking it off with

17
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,719
workshops from the bug lady Suzanne and

18
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:52,398
Dr. greenhouse followed by a facility

19
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,399
tour and then a bunch of excellent

20
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,640
speakers that were former podcast guests

21
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:59,039
such as Jeremy Plum, Dr. Michael

22
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,120
Brownbridge, Les Evans from Drram, and

23
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,520
many more. It's going to be 3 days of

24
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:05,438
talks and networking. Then on the 7th,

25
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,200
the Montana Living Soil Alliance is

26
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:08,719
hosting a tasting event that will be

27
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,640
included in the price of the conference

28
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:12,560

29
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,719
private event with cannabis donated by

30
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,640
the Living Soil Alliance as a way to

31
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:18,879

42
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,600
My guest this week is Michael Gutenson.

43
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,159
Michael is an associate professor of

44
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:48,158
horiculture at West Virginia University.

45
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,479
He earned his diploma in biology from

46
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,320
the Julius Maximleians University in

47
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:54,879
Germany where he specialized in plant

48
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:56,959
physiology. While pursuing his PhD at

49
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:58,959
the University of Cologne in Germany and

50
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:01,199
during a subsequent post-doal position

51
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:03,280
at the Martin Luther University in

52
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,280
Germany, Dr. Dr. Guten worked on

53
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,359
multiple projects studying metabolite

54
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,520
and protein transport processes in

55
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:11,840
plants using biochemical and genetic

56
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,239
approaches. While at Purdue University

57
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,680
for a second post-doal position, he was

58
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,319
introduced to his current research

59
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,280
topic, the biosynthesis of volatile

60
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:23,919
organic compounds, VOCC's, in plants and

61
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,000
their various biological functions. His

62
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:27,919
research interests include plant insect

63
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,759
interaction such as plant defenses

64
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:32,399
against herbivores and pollinator

65
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:35,199
attraction to flowers, flavor compounds

66
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,599
in horicultural fruit crops, specialized

67
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:39,359
metabolites in medicinal plants,

68
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:41,199
classical genetic and metabolic

69
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,720
engineering approaches to introduce or

70
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:46,399
improve desired VOCC traits into crop

71
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:48,959
plants and mechanisms regulating the

72
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,760
flux in complex metabolic networks

73
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,840
involved in tarpine formation in plants.

74
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:55,359
Dr. Dr. Guten is also involved in

75
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,840
steering the operations of the

76
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,319
analytical biochemistry core lab in the

77
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,878
division of plant and soil sciences. Now

78
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:05,679
on to the show. Well, thanks for coming

79
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:08,239
on the show today. Yeah, thanks for

80
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,480
having me. I'm excited.

81
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,319
Yes. So, I saw an article about your

82
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:14,439
research and reached out to you and you

83
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:17,759
were kind enough to get back to me and

84
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:20,158
we've we've talked a little bit offline,

85
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:22,799
but I was hoping you could share some of

86
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:24,799
your research and findings with our

87
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,519
audience and what you've been working on

88
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:30,080
at Western West Virginia University.

89
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:33,439
Yeah, sure. Sure, sure. Happy to do so.

90
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:36,319
Well, so I mean basic approach of what

91
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:39,840
we're doing is is that we take a little

92
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:42,318
bit of a step back from looking at hemp

93
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,920
and cannabis more from the human

94
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:46,000
perspective

95
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:47,958
uh and maybe look a little bit more at

96
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,120
it from the from the plant side of

97
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:54,719
things. And we're trying to understand

98
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:58,239
why certain things as tarpen and

99
00:03:54,719 --> 00:04:01,919
cannabonoids are being produced in hemp.

100
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:04,239
Um, and I mean the discipline that we I

101
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:07,119
and my lab are working in is also very

102
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,799
often called chemical ecology. And so it

103
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,759
takes exactly this approach like we're

104
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:14,000
trying to understand why plants produce

105
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:17,478
what on the scientific side of things is

106
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:21,519
called secondary or specialized

107
00:04:17,478 --> 00:04:23,279
metabolites. Um, and in general define

108
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,840
that for listeners as to what falls

109
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:27,758
under uh secondary metabolites within

110
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:29,198
the constituents of a plant. Yeah, I

111
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,199
know this is probably a term that most

112
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,800
people are not so familiar. So, so in

113
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:36,040
general we we talk about either primary

114
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:39,040
metabolites or

115
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:40,879
secondary specialized metabolites.

116
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,400
Primary metabolites is something that

117
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:44,478
most people are pretty familiar with.

118
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:47,839
This is your your carbohydrates, your

119
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:50,879
carbs, how people call them, your your

120
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:52,879
lipids, your um and and your your your

121
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:55,199
proteins. Yeah. So, this is what we need

122
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:56,560
in our nutrition basically. And you

123
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,160
should have a little bit of a balance

124
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,360
there. This is what's primary

125
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,120
metabolites and they're produced by all

126
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:05,680
organisms including plants. What's

127
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,519
specific about plants is is that they

128
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,680
also produce a large set of other

129
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:11,519
metabolites and very small quantities

130
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,319
very often. And those are called

131
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:16,079
secondary or specialized metabolites.

132
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:19,759
And that has a little bit to do with the

133
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:22,000
lifestyle of plants. Um if I scare you

134
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,639
or one of your listeners, uh they

135
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,720
probably would run off and flee. Yeah.

136
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,478
Um, same thing for an animal. Yeah. If

137
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,960
an

138
00:05:27,478 --> 00:05:32,959
animal is in a stressed situation, one

139
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:36,399
of the easiest ways to get out of it is

140
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:40,319
just to run away and flee. A plant is

141
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:41,918
rooted. It can't run away. And so it has

142
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:45,680
to fight back basically at the spot

143
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:48,159
where it is. And that's why um plants

144
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,400
developed into being absolute masters in

145
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,520
in in producing a lot of very

146
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:56,000
interesting and could also say nasty

147
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:57,918
chemicals. Yeah. Uh so a lot of these

148
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,680
these specialized metabolites plant

149
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:03,758
produce because they have to somehow

150
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:05,759
deal with their environment and to a

151
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,759
large extent with their what we call a

152
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:10,800
biotic environment. So with other

153
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,319
organisms, with other plants, with other

154
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,400
microbes,

155
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,560
uh, and of course also with animals and

156
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:18,239
among animals, I think for plants, the

157
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,160
most important ones are the insects

158
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,960
because that's that's number-wise

159
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,479
probably what they face most. And so for

160
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:26,560
doing that, they produce these these

161
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:31,038
metabolites. And that's no different for

162
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:32,560
hemp. So what we humans use or are

163
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:35,038
interested in hemp are actually

164
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,439
chemicals that are there for a purpose

165
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:39,038
to help the plants, not necessarily us.

166
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:40,959
And that's kind of the the little bit

167
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:43,519
the philosophy or approach that we're

168
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:46,159
taking. We're trying to kind of ignore

169
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:48,680
to some extent why humans are interested

170
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,960
in hemp and cannabis and rather try to

171
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:53,439
understand why is the plant producing

172
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:55,599
these things in the first place. Yeah.

173
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:57,279
um because it actually helps better

174
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,680
understand how these things are

175
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:01,758
regulated and produced in the plant when

176
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,478
where and how

177
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:06,639
um and then that creates a lot of very

178
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:08,879
interesting and useful basic knowledge

179
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:11,280
that then you can apply later on again.

180
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:13,079
So this is a little bit in in a nutshell

181
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:17,638
our our approach

182
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:21,279
there. So you studied factors that

183
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:22,360
increased secondary metabolites in hemp.

184
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:24,478
Uh

185
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:26,400
specifically, you know, the most common

186
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:30,159
ones that I think of when I think of

187
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:32,318
that would be CBD, THC, and and tarpen

188
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,880
would all fall as secondary metabolites.

189
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,879
Are there any other are there any others

190
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:38,399
that you were looking at in some of your

191
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:40,959
research?

192
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:43,519
Yeah. So, so, so I mean when we do

193
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:45,839
analysis we generally look at

194
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:47,439
cannabonoids but not just the ones that

195
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:49,839
you mentioned although those are of

196
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:53,360
course are the the the most abundant

197
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:56,318
ones. Uh we simp simply look from the

198
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,319
point of view of how much amount wise is

199
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,080
there. And then the other big group of

200
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,000
compounds that we're looking at are are

201
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:04,800
the tarpen. So the essential oils

202
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,360
basically uh what you normally perceive

203
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,960
as the the scent or the smell because

204
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,280
simply because they go into the gas

205
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:13,918
phase and you can sniff them. So that's

206
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:17,279
that's the two major classes, but we in

207
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:19,478
in in our analytics, we inevitably don't

208
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:22,638
just see a few compounds

209
00:08:19,478 --> 00:08:24,878
there, like you mentioned THC, CBD, and

210
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:27,519
some of the other well-known cannabonoid

211
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:30,080
compounds. But when we do an analysis,

212
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:32,079
we currently are in in in a situation

213
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:33,838
where we can roughly see about 50

214
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,320
different cannabonoids. Although I mean,

215
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:40,560
if you look in literature, there's over

216
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:42,320
100 cannabonoids known by now. Um we

217
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:45,439
it's it's it's technically quite

218
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,600
challenging to detect all of them. Um I

219
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,760
mean we we over the last couple years we

220
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,480
definitely improved in our analytics and

221
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:54,080
can detect more things now. Uh and the

222
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,839
same applies for the turppines. I mean

223
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,080
we see basically everything that's

224
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,959
there. Question is just can we really

225
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,800
identify undoubtedly everything? And I'm

226
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:04,239
al always a little bit on the cautionary

227
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:05,838
side there. I don't want to lean myself

228
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,879
too much out of the window and claim I

229
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,160
can identify everything. But we we see a

230
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:11,799
lot of things there. But that's the two

231
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:13,319
major groups of compounds we're looking

232
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:15,919
at.

233
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:17,680
And yes, you're right. I mean, what you

234
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:20,159
said before that we're particularly

235
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:22,879
interested what induces the formation of

236
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:26,639
these things. Um and that is actually

237
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:31,399
the was sort of the onset of uh a USDA

238
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:34,000
grant um that we were awarded um in

239
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:35,759
2020 as one of the first ones that got

240
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,360
actually federal funding for working on

241
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:40,879
this. Um and the the the the major

242
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,680
question that we were trying to address

243
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:46,559
in this this in this project was the the

244
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:48,958
so so-called going hot problem. So

245
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:52,479
environmental factors triggering

246
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:56,159
triggering an an increase in in the THC

247
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:59,560
content that would push industrial hemp

248
00:09:56,159 --> 00:10:03,199
from its legal status to surpassing

249
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:06,000
the.3% THC contently turning it from a

250
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,839
crop into a a drug. And we wanted to

251
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,559
understand or identify some

252
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:12,320
environmental factors that would do so.

253
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:14,879
and then also start understanding a

254
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,600
little bit the the metabolic and genetic

255
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:20,799
regulation that's that's behind that. So

256
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:23,040
why is that happening?

257
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:25,439
Now you were working on hemp. A lot of

258
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:27,799
people listening to this podcast are

259
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:31,200
growing cannabis.

260
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:34,159
Um my my question to you would be is it

261
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,320
fair to to assume with the similarities

262
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:39,439
between the crops that there may be some

263
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:42,959
overlap in terms of your your results

264
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:47,040
having similar effects on uh cannabis

265
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:48,639
plants as you're seeing with hemp.

266
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:50,639
Um I got to be a little bit careful

267
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:55,199
there. So I can c I can definitely say

268
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:59,919
we also tested um seed hemp varieties um

269
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:04,079
and not just CBD or CBG varieties um and

270
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:06,479
those so seed hemp and and CBD varieties

271
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:09,759
um behaved in the same way. They both

272
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:12,399
saw an upregulation of THC production

273
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:15,200
under certain stress conditions of

274
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:17,039
course at completely different levels.

275
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:20,320
Yeah. I mean the THC level in a seed

276
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:22,838
hemp variety is is fairly minimal

277
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:25,519
um compared to what you find in a CBD

278
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:27,600
variety. Uh but in principle in both

279
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:31,600
cases but with both different types of

280
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:33,519
hemp we saw an increase in THC. You're

281
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:38,240
not going to run anywhere close to being

282
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:40,639
in sort of risking or surpassing the the

283
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,278
legal THC limit with a seed hemp variety

284
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:45,278
because it's so little. Um but in

285
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:48,240
principle the induction you could see in

286
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:51,039
well as well there. So based on that I

287
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,039
would I would broadly conclude that yes

288
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:55,519
there's a similar regulatory mechanism

289
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:57,278
in play just that you're starting from a

290
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,879
different baseline so to say and of

291
00:11:57,278 --> 00:12:02,278
course that that determines how much you

292
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:05,519
get. I can't say if that's the

293
00:12:02,278 --> 00:12:07,720
same the same thing would happen in a in

294
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:10,799
in cannabis.

295
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:13,600
Um, as you probably know, the problem is

296
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:16,519
that we can still not work with cannabis

297
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:20,560
because it's on the research side in

298
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:22,720
academia because um it's still illegal

299
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:26,599
at the federal level and since we do get

300
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:30,079
federal funding uh we have to follow

301
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:34,800
federal rules and laws and regulations.

302
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:38,159
So, um, working with cannabis that has a

303
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:41,838
higher THC level than.3% is off limits

304
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:44,399
for us and will stay off limits as long

305
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:47,560
as there's no change in the legislation

306
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:50,320
on the on the federal side of things.

307
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:51,759
Um, so that might be confusing for some

308
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,959
people if they think, well, but wait a

309
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:57,919
moment, I'm in in my state where I'm

310
00:12:54,958 --> 00:13:00,479
operating. Um, I'm a grower. it's legal

311
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:03,120
to grow it here and sell things. Um, but

312
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:05,920
the point is we get federal funding and

313
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:08,320
at that determines what we can what we

314
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:11,199
can do. So, it's basically depending our

315
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:14,720
our funding status. So, universities

316
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:17,120
cannot work with with cannabis because

317
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,519
of the the funding situation that that

318
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,200
limits us. And so, I I can't tell you

319
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,799
anything about cannabis because I'm

320
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,440
simply not in a situation that I can

321
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:27,359
work with it. I I understand. So, so

322
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,839
what you're saying is it's it's likely

323
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:32,079
your your hypothesis is that it's likely

324
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,240
but not definitive that you would re you

325
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:36,078
would receive

326
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:38,879
similar effects based on the

327
00:13:36,078 --> 00:13:41,199
similarities of the of the two plants.

328
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:44,480
I'm I mean I would based on the the

329
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:46,240
results that I that we have I would if

330
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,240
if I would ever come into the situation

331
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:51,200
that I could work on cannabis my

332
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:55,200
hypothesis would be that I would expect

333
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:58,800
the same the same regulatory mechanisms

334
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:01,440
at play. Um but of course that would

335
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:04,319
have to be tested. Um, the question of

336
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,320
course is I mean what I could envision

337
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,560
what or or what you could put up as a

338
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,278
counterargument there is like well in

339
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:14,799
cannabis you have have already such a

340
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:18,000
much higher THC level maybe you're sort

341
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:20,479
of maxing out at some point. Yeah. And

342
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,720
then you can't increase it even more

343
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,959
because there is already so much that

344
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,600
there's there's no there's other

345
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:29,919
limitations that would limit it from

346
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,959
being further increased. Yeah.

347
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:34,879
Yeah. So, that could that could be one

348
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:37,679
thing, but I mean it's it's pure

349
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:40,399
speculation at this point before we're

350
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:44,399
not in a situation to test that. You you

351
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:46,078
actually won't won't know. Yeah. I I

352
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,000
want to talk to you about plant stress,

353
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:50,638
but before we do because you brought

354
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:55,360
this up, um there was some I think it

355
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:57,198
was Dr. Daniellea Vgar at uh uh Cornell

356
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,759
I believe that I talked to that

357
00:14:57,198 --> 00:15:03,519
mentioned this idea of a dilution effect

358
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:08,639
where a plant has the genetic capability

359
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:11,159
to only produce so much um so so many

360
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:14,839
cannabonoids or so much THC and then

361
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:18,078
once once it reaches a certain level of

362
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:20,639
biomass that that THC level in theory

363
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:22,078
would be diluted across more you know

364
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,720
greater surface area because it's

365
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:26,958
producing more biomass. So in theory, as

366
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,480
your yields increase, some of the

367
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:31,278
concentrations of some of these

368
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:35,039
secondary metabolites would in theory go

369
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:36,559
down. Yeah, that's that's one thing you

370
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:38,480
could envision. Of course, I mean, the

371
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:42,239
question is like how do you achieve your

372
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:44,320
your final THC yield, so to say, if you

373
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,320
want to call it that way. Um, you

374
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,399
brought up biomass. That's of course one

375
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,879
point. I mean the more biomass or

376
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:53,600
flowers a a plant produces of course the

377
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:56,159
more yield you will have there and of

378
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,560
course that that can be influencedly by

379
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:01,439
the growth habit of the plant. Um so

380
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:03,838
that's one one factor. I would bring up

381
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,399
one other factor or argument in there

382
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,959
and that is um I mean I'm from my

383
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:11,278
background I'm a plant biochemist and so

384
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:14,719
of course I always look like more at

385
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:17,720
from that perspective at it and there

386
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:20,000
are other factors that can limit

387
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:22,680
production and and you have to think

388
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,278
about any any of these these compounds

389
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:28,799
um they're they're produced from certain

390
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:30,639
precursors that need to be provided from

391
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:32,479
the rest of the

392
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,560
And and at some point you might might

393
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,639
just reach a point where there's

394
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:39,599
limitations on that end. The plant can

395
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:42,560
just provide so much building blocks so

396
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:45,440
to say for making cannabonoids as it can

397
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:48,039
without at some point sacrificing other

398
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,959
things. Yeah. And then it's a trade-off

399
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:54,078
between producing more in this case

400
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:56,799
would be cannabonoids versus kind of

401
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:58,958
needing other things as well. Um, and so

402
00:16:56,799 --> 00:17:01,599
it's very often this this kind of like

403
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:03,919
what gives the plant more of a benefit

404
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,838
producing more cannabonoids maybe versus

405
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:09,918
producing something else in a larger

406
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:11,918
quantity. So we we very often talk when

407
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,919
we in the in the science side of things

408
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:16,959
when we talk about metabolism we very

409
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,038
often talk about networks rather than

410
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:21,078
sort of

411
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:24,400
linear pathways. Yeah.

412
00:17:21,078 --> 00:17:27,198
Um and and and and that's anyway where

413
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,840
science has moved on the last 10 20

414
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,200
years on the biochemistry side that we

415
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:34,000
understand that everything's kind of

416
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,319
like a huge network connected with each

417
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,480
other. And although very often we just

418
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:40,879
look at one final product because that's

419
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:43,279
what in a particular project you're

420
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:46,240
interested in. But you always have to

421
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:48,480
keep in mind it's that is not isolated

422
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,079
from all the rest that's going on there.

423
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,000
And so you have to kind of consider that

424
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:54,399
as well that that you're rather looking

425
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,720
at one tiny little aspect of a gigantic

426
00:17:54,400 --> 00:18:00,440
network of things and just because if

427
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:03,279
you're up regulating one things

428
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:05,519
there's 250 other things happening in

429
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:08,079
parallel and you can't ignore that.

430
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:10,000
Yeah. So even though you're kind of

431
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:11,439
interested in bringing up the level of

432
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,359
that one thing that you're interested

433
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,360
in, you have to consider that that's

434
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:17,759
happening at the backdrop of everything

435
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:19,839
else that's happening there as well. And

436
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:22,000
so there might be limitations that come

437
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:24,319
rather from this whole network that say

438
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,160
like well that's enough now we need to

439
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:27,759
do other things as well here because

440
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:31,440
otherwise the plant's not doing well

441
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:33,440
either. Um so that could be one other

442
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,279
factor sort of limiting things at some

443
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,720
point.

444
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:38,558
Yeah. Yeah. So that has me thinking. So,

445
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,600
so what you're saying essentially is a

446
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:43,759
plant has uh a certain amount of

447
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:46,519
resources, limited amount of resources,

448
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:49,759
and it allocates those resources based

449
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:51,440
on its goals. Either plant defense to

450
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:52,720
protect itself. In the case like you

451
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,919
mentioned, if you someone scared you,

452
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,759
you could run away. Well, the plant

453
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:58,400
would have to produce these secondary

454
00:18:55,759 --> 00:19:00,480
metabolites to protect itself from

455
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:04,120
insects, environmental conditions,

456
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:08,079
whatever. or uh as a way of

457
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:11,639
um a continuation of its of its species

458
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:14,159
by re reproduction essentially correct

459
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:15,840
so so if I'm understanding correctly we

460
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,600
have a limited amount of resources and

461
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:20,240
that plant is going to allocate those

462
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:25,279
resources towards one of those goals

463
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:28,640
whether it's reproduction protection uh

464
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:30,960
growth overall growth and so it's a

465
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,960
constant

466
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:35,200
I don't know what the word I'm looking

467
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:37,679
for here. Uh it's just a constant uh

468
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,440
process, I guess. Balance balancing

469
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:41,440
these various different things out.

470
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:44,400
Yeah. It's it's it's it's constantly a

471
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:47,038
balance and and if you you you chip if

472
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,960
you raise one thing up, you intimately

473
00:19:47,038 --> 00:19:52,480
going to lose at some other end. Yeah.

474
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:54,160
There's only so much in total available.

475
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,919
Uh and ultimately if you want to really

476
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:59,440
go to all the way down I mean like

477
00:19:56,919 --> 00:20:01,559
um ultimately anything that a plant

478
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:04,000
produces and does comes from

479
00:20:01,558 --> 00:20:05,918
photosynthesis and the photosynthetic

480
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,720
capacity of a plant basil limits how

481
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:10,640
much is there how much resources are

482
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:13,440
there. You can't do more than what it

483
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:15,919
fixes in photosynthesis in for form of

484
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:19,759
fixing carbon dioxide and producing

485
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:21,759
sugar molecules initially or how much

486
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:23,679
nitrogen you can take up from the soil

487
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:25,359
or other nutrients that you need that

488
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:28,080
that ultimately limits things. How much

489
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:30,558
is there and that limits what you can

490
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:32,798
make out of that. Yeah. So there's an

491
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:34,558
input and there's an output so to say

492
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:37,119
and that that ultimately needs to be in

493
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:39,839
balance and there that so the all these

494
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:42,239
things limit in the end how much you can

495
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:44,000
produce of of a certain compound

496
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,519
basically and yes you're absolutely

497
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:50,159
right I mean growth reproduction in form

498
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:53,480
of seed production or in other crops it

499
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:56,159
would be fruit production

500
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:58,159
um that's other factors that play into

501
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:01,600
that yeah and you can't just ignore that

502
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:03,520
that it's just steer. Yeah.

503
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:05,918
So, one of the examples I think of that

504
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:09,759
kind of highlights this is the idea of

505
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:11,840
that plant that you threw out because it

506
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:13,679
was it was sickly or or a seed that got

507
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:16,240
lost and ended up in your compost pile

508
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:18,679
and it was neglected all season long.

509
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:21,759
And yet this plant was able to survive

510
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:24,880
and not thrive because it probably had

511
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:27,119
nutrient stress and drought stress and

512
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,200
and maybe heat stress, but it was able

513
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:31,678
to to survive through all these things.

514
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,960
So it was very resilient. um at the end

515
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:37,600
when that plant is ending its life

516
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:40,400
cycle we what I've seen is higher levels

517
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:42,158
of secondary metabolites higher THC

518
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,880
maybe higher levels of tarpen all of

519
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:47,840
these secondary metabolites but the

520
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:50,880
yield is dramatically lower sickly plant

521
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:53,038
it's not um necessarily healthy but due

522
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,720
to all of these stresses from being

523
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:57,919
neglected

524
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:00,640
um we tend to see higher you know people

525
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:03,200
will say the best cannabis I ever smoked

526
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:06,400
or grew was this poor plant that was,

527
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,840
you know, horribly stressed. Um, what

528
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,360
are your thoughts on that? Does that is

529
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:11,359
that sort of fit with this idea of

530
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:14,079
allocation of resources as the plant was

531
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:17,038
just trying to survive?

532
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:19,960
Yeah. And it's not necessarily just a a

533
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:22,079
the plants survive, it's the species

534
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:24,400
survive. Plants don't function

535
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:26,960
necessarily at the at the level of

536
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,840
individual plants. They try to survive

537
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:32,240
as a species. And so what plants very

538
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:34,158
often do if they're in in what you

539
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,919
described like a nutrient deficiency or

540
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:37,840
so like just a not a very good

541
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:39,840
environmental condition which yes you

542
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:42,558
can create in in your greenhouse in your

543
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:45,119
growth facility. Yeah. Because you

544
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:48,038
neglected it or over watered it or

545
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:50,319
whatever it's some something went wrong.

546
00:22:48,038 --> 00:22:52,558
Um, one of the important things that

547
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:55,359
plants very often do is they they try to

548
00:22:52,558 --> 00:22:57,279
reproduce produce seeds in the hopes

549
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:59,918
that the next generation actually finds

550
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:02,079
better conditions. Yeah. And so it will

551
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:03,919
try to somehow get through and produce

552
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:07,839
even if it's just a few flowers and a

553
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:10,720
few seeds. But it basically in the hopes

554
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:12,240
of maintaining itself as a species, it

555
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,720
produces seeds which is the next

556
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,480
generation and then hopes that those

557
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,960
seeds are spread somewhere in a place

558
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,839
where where there's better conditions or

559
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:24,798
next season is the the weather is

560
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:26,959
better. Yeah. there's more more rain or

561
00:23:24,798 --> 00:23:29,839
better conditions or the seed is carried

562
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:32,480
to some other environment where the soil

563
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:35,038
is more fertile or something like that.

564
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,880
So yes, you always have to look at that

565
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:38,798
plants function in a different way and

566
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,280
that's something goes back to what I

567
00:23:38,798 --> 00:23:43,119
said at the beginning. This is you you

568
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:45,599
if you want to understand what plants do

569
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:49,399
and if it is a crop plant and hemp or

570
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:52,319
cannabis are crop lands applies

571
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:55,280
to a crop plant in the same way like to

572
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:56,798
any wild plants. Yeah, sure. Crop lands

573
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:59,599
there's a few things that are different

574
00:23:56,798 --> 00:24:01,679
because we humans over hundreds if

575
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:04,240
better say thousands of years have sort

576
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:06,798
of selected certain things and s certain

577
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:09,839
traits have been manipulated in certain

578
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:14,240
ways. But a lot of this basic regulation

579
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:15,839
is still there. It's not gone. Um and if

580
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,839
we want to understand our plants, then

581
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:19,599
we you really have to put yourselves in

582
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:21,678
the sho literally have to put yourselves

583
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:24,158
in the shoes of a plant to understand

584
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:25,679
how it's actually functioning. Uh and

585
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:29,960
that's that goes back to what I said.

586
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:32,559
Sometimes you you have to I think for

587
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:34,558
understanding hemp and cannabis I think

588
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:37,759
you sometimes have to take a step back

589
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:40,879
and say like well I know our final goal

590
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:43,079
is to grow hemp or cannabis for the

591
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:47,039
purpose of getting cannabonoids or other

592
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:48,798
purposes but why is why are things

593
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:51,119
happening there in the first place and

594
00:24:48,798 --> 00:24:53,200
for understanding that you have to take

595
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:55,319
the human component out a little bit and

596
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,679
look rather from the plant side of

597
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:59,839
things and that's what we're trying in

598
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:02,000
my lab and in our research. We're really

599
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:03,599
trying to go back and like okay why are

600
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,880
these things happening in the first

601
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:08,558
first place and what are the underlying

602
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:10,799
mechanisms that are there? Yeah. And

603
00:25:08,558 --> 00:25:12,960
then we can kind of understand one

604
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:14,798
factor with any crop plant is that you

605
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,480
have to consider well there was human

606
00:25:14,798 --> 00:25:19,480
domestication and then cultivation and

607
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:22,880
breeding happening

608
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:24,880
for eventually thousands of years. So of

609
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:27,840
course that's not a wild plant anymore.

610
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:29,919
So some things were selected or changed

611
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:33,599
but a lot of the basic regulation is

612
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:35,679
still there. That hasn't gone away and

613
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:36,759
will not go away. Yeah. It's it's still

614
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:40,080
there.

615
00:25:36,759 --> 00:25:42,960
Yeah. So

616
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:45,759
yeah. So you studied essentially what

617
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:48,759
would cause a plant to go pot to create

618
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:51,640
more of these secondary metabolites.

619
00:25:48,759 --> 00:25:54,319
Um, before we go into what your findings

620
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:55,759
were, can I have a question about plant

621
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:57,519
stress? So, we've been talking this

622
00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:59,839
whole time essentially about plant

623
00:25:57,519 --> 00:26:01,278
stress. What stresses plants out? And

624
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:03,278
it's a variety of things off the top of

625
00:26:01,278 --> 00:26:05,038
my head. You can have heat stress, you

626
00:26:03,278 --> 00:26:06,319
can have cold stress, you can have a

627
00:26:05,038 --> 00:26:08,480
variety of different types of

628
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:10,639
environmental stress like drought

629
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,720
stress, overwatering. And then you have

630
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:16,559
your, you know, uh, biotic stress like

631
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:19,278
insect pressures, um, things like that,

632
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:20,440
you know, herbivy with a insect eating

633
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:24,319
the leaf

634
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:26,798
itself. Are all stresses to this to

635
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:29,839
plants the same or do they have

636
00:26:26,798 --> 00:26:32,319
different effects on the plant?

637
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:34,918
No, they're not all the same. Um that

638
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:38,480
that for sure.

639
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:40,559
Um so and that I mean plants need to

640
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,880
respond to all stresses and and we

641
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:45,519
basically you outlined it perfectly

642
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:47,600
there. So in in principle you can

643
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:50,319
categorize things in two major buckets.

644
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:52,678
The one is abiotic. So anything that is

645
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:55,759
is in the environment that's not another

646
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:57,960
organism. And you you mentioned water

647
00:26:55,759 --> 00:27:01,359
stress, heat,

648
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:04,880
cold, you can I mean even light stress

649
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:07,119
in the sense of UV or or too much light.

650
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:10,080
Um so there's all sorts of factors that

651
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:12,519
can involve that. And then of course

652
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:14,720
nutrition, lack of it or too much

653
00:27:12,519 --> 00:27:16,158
salinity, soil conditions. I mean

654
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,880
there's a lot of things that can go into

655
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:21,440
that. Acidity or or sort of pH where

656
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:23,520
value of water um there's a lot of

657
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,200
things there. So that's the one side of

658
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:26,639
things and then the other side yes as

659
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,038
you mentioned is the biotic side of

660
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,960
things and that's basically microbes on

661
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:33,359
the one hand side which very often are

662
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:36,319
like either pathogens that harm the

663
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:39,119
plants or they're helpful if they're

664
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:41,839
like fixing nitrogen or microisa that

665
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:45,599
help taking up nutrients and then of

666
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:47,599
course it's animals. Um and again they

667
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:50,639
can be beneficial or they can be sort of

668
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:52,719
harmful herbivores you mentioned. Yes.

669
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,919
Um, but there's also beneficial insects.

670
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:57,600
I mean, growers will know that

671
00:27:54,919 --> 00:27:59,278
you your beneficial insects in your

672
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:02,000
greenhouse, in your growth facility to

673
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:05,278
kind of fight pests. Uh, and plants

674
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,640
actually act very often actively attract

675
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:09,319
these beneficial insects for helping

676
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:12,799
them.

677
00:28:09,319 --> 00:28:15,359
Um, but how a plant responds to these

678
00:28:12,798 --> 00:28:17,119
different abiotic and biotic stresses

679
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:19,759
can be quite different. I mean, you

680
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:21,918
can't generalize. Every individual

681
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:24,158
factor can have a different consequence.

682
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:26,640
Yeah. So plants, some of these

683
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:28,640
specialized or secondary metabolites

684
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,880
help the plant actually sort of cope

685
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,559
with some of these abiotic factors. So

686
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,200
you have certain things that almost work

687
00:28:32,558 --> 00:28:38,639
like a sunscreen. Yeah. So they protect

688
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:42,399
plants from from too much light or light

689
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:46,320
stress. Yeah. Um other things very oft

690
00:28:42,398 --> 00:28:48,398
sort of help with um sort of some of the

691
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:52,240
consequences of some of the stresses.

692
00:28:48,398 --> 00:28:54,959
Yeah. Um, and so cannabonoids are maybe

693
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,798
not necessarily falling directly in that

694
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,600
category, but of course you're right and

695
00:28:56,798 --> 00:29:01,119
you mentioned that before that

696
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:02,879
sometimes plants, hemp plants, cannabis

697
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:05,119
plants respond with sort of an

698
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,880
alteration in their cannabonoid level if

699
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:09,038
they experience some of this abiotic

700
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:11,278
stress. But that sometimes could be

701
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:13,839
rather kind of an indirect effect. If if

702
00:29:11,278 --> 00:29:15,599
you're changing sort of supply of

703
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:17,839
nutrition

704
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:20,398
um if there's too much or too little

705
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:22,000
then that's kind of like if you see a

706
00:29:20,398 --> 00:29:23,439
change on the cannabonoid level that

707
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,919
might be rather kind of an indirect

708
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:27,679
effect that overall metabolism of the

709
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:32,000
plant is affected and then that's

710
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:33,440
affecting cannabonoids as well. Um so so

711
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,599
that's the one thing that can happen

712
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,440
there with the biotic stress that's a

713
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:40,038
completely different thing because the a

714
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:42,840
lot of these secondary metabolites are

715
00:29:40,038 --> 00:29:45,038
specifically produced and very often

716
00:29:42,839 --> 00:29:47,759
upregulated to deal with these stress

717
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:50,119
situations. So with with biotic stress

718
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:52,879
with being attacked by pedagogens or

719
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:54,798
pests that's that's their one of their

720
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:57,120
main purposes. Yeah. And that's no

721
00:29:54,798 --> 00:30:01,038
different for tarpen or cannabonoids

722
00:29:57,119 --> 00:30:01,038
that that's why they're there.

723
00:30:02,798 --> 00:30:07,679
So

724
00:30:05,079 --> 00:30:10,720
um so basically what you're saying is is

725
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:12,640
all stresses are not the same and don't

726
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:15,798
have the same plant effect and what

727
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:18,520
we're what we're getting as in terms of

728
00:30:15,798 --> 00:30:22,440
cannabonoid effect is

729
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:27,278
actually not the primary mechanism or or

730
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:30,080
necessarily what the plant is focused on

731
00:30:27,278 --> 00:30:33,679
um when it's creating these is that am I

732
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:35,678
am I understanding kind of well I mean

733
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:37,360
we haven't done much on the abiotic side

734
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:39,360
but of course I'm aware that there's

735
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:41,359
quite a bit of literature out there but

736
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:44,079
I would have a little bit of a hard time

737
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:46,839
seeing how a cannabonoid molecule could

738
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:49,278
help a plant

739
00:30:46,839 --> 00:30:51,439
um with dealing with some of these

740
00:30:49,278 --> 00:30:53,519
abiotic stresses sort of directly

741
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,360
dealing with that yeah there is there's

742
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:57,038
other compounds where you can make a

743
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:59,038
direct connection yeah they produce some

744
00:30:57,038 --> 00:31:01,440
of these things it like I said before it

745
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:04,440
works like a if you putting on sun

746
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:08,320
lotion or sunscreen basically. Yeah.

747
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:10,679
Cannabonoids don't do that. Yeah. Um

748
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:12,359
first of all from where they're being

749
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:15,038
produced.

750
00:31:12,359 --> 00:31:16,719
Um and second of all also from their

751
00:31:15,038 --> 00:31:20,240
chemistry I would have a little bit of a

752
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:23,960
hard time seeing how that would work. So

753
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:27,720
you're saying like drought stress like

754
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:31,720
increasing tarpine levels in a plant or

755
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:34,000
increasing CBD does not

756
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:36,079
directly help a plant that's

757
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,398
experiencing drought stress. So it may

758
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:40,960
be a some sort of secondary mechanism

759
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:43,359
that occurs. It could be either a

760
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:46,319
secondary mechanism sort of kind of like

761
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:49,918
just something in metabolism is altering

762
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:52,918
and that kind of results in some

763
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:55,759
consequence in cannabonoid or tarpine

764
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:57,759
formation. The the the only thing you

765
00:31:55,759 --> 00:32:00,558
could argue for is a plant is in

766
00:31:57,759 --> 00:32:03,519
generally stressed by an abiotic factor.

767
00:32:00,558 --> 00:32:06,798
Of course, it's potentially also at risk

768
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:08,798
of being more susceptible to biotic

769
00:32:06,798 --> 00:32:10,639
stress.

770
00:32:08,798 --> 00:32:12,000
Yes. Yeah. So, you're anyhow stressed,

771
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,159
you're weakened because of some

772
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,919
environmental factor. There's a drought

773
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:17,840
or there's something else going on in

774
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:23,038
your environment. So, you're basically

775
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:25,519
in a in a weak um susceptible status and

776
00:32:23,038 --> 00:32:27,440
that makes you more prone for being

777
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:29,839
attacked by pests or pathogens

778
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,278
basically. And then in that context, of

779
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:33,038
course, it would make sense to

780
00:32:31,278 --> 00:32:35,278
upregulate some of these compounds

781
00:32:33,038 --> 00:32:38,398
because you're still trying to defend

782
00:32:35,278 --> 00:32:40,720
yourself. Yeah. But again, it's not the

783
00:32:38,398 --> 00:32:42,558
abiotic factor that you directly are

784
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,960
kind of like dealing with. It's a

785
00:32:42,558 --> 00:32:47,759
consequence of the abiotic factor

786
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,679
weakening you so to say as a plant and

787
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:51,278
then

788
00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:54,038
that results in potentially you being at

789
00:32:51,278 --> 00:32:56,960
more at risk of being prone to other

790
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:59,759
stresses. Yeah. Yeah. So, you're saying

791
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:03,519
as as the plant receives drought stress,

792
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:07,679
it it thinks, "Oh my gosh, I'm now more

793
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:10,000
I'm weaker. I'm more open to pests. So I

794
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:11,919
by increasing my tarpen or my

795
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
cannabonoids, I may better protect

796
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:16,080
myself from these pests that are more

797
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,960
likely to hit me now that I'm more

798
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:20,720
susceptible. So it's yeah, I mean that's

799
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:23,519
the biological explanation. That would

800
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:25,600
be the biological benefit of of of doing

801
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:27,200
that. Yeah. sort of you you you're

802
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:29,199
you're you're you're trying you're

803
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,519
increasing your your likelihood of

804
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:35,038
surviving or reproducing at least to the

805
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:37,200
extent that that guarantees the survival

806
00:33:35,038 --> 00:33:39,038
of you as a species basically. So

807
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,120
there's there's you always have to look

808
00:33:39,038 --> 00:33:43,759
at the biological purpose of something

809
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:45,518
and so yes you can draw that conclusion.

810
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:47,679
I'm not saying that that's what it is

811
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:50,399
because I don't know we haven't looked

812
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:52,080
at that but in other plants that's

813
00:33:50,398 --> 00:33:53,719
clearly there is a connection between

814
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:57,278
abiotic stress and some of these

815
00:33:53,720 --> 00:34:00,720
responses which is in in ina in some

816
00:33:57,278 --> 00:34:02,319
cases it's not clear that they're the

817
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,480
the increased production of some of

818
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:06,918
these secondary metabolites would help

819
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:09,918
dealing with this abiotic stress but it

820
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:11,519
basically protects the plant from

821
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:13,838
potential other things in that

822
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:13,838
situation.

823
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:20,320
Now, a popular term or concept in the

824
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:23,119
last few years has been this idea of

825
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:24,399
crop steering, which is I don't know if

826
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:27,919
you're familiar with it or not, but it's

827
00:34:24,398 --> 00:34:29,759
essentially intentional stress that

828
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:31,679
you're giving to the plant to create a

829
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:35,040
certain response. So some examples of

830
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:37,358
this um cannabis growers have tried

831
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:39,679
everything over the years would be um

832
00:34:37,358 --> 00:34:41,598
you know uh what they call drybacks

833
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:43,760
essentially intentionally withholding

834
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:46,159
water to create drought stress at

835
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:49,599
certain stages of plant growth or with

836
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:52,919
withholding nutrients or um getting

837
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:56,800
closer to harvest. I've heard of people

838
00:34:52,918 --> 00:34:59,519
um reducing CO2 and reducing light

839
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:02,560
levels to lower stress. But then on the

840
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:05,920
flip side, um, cooling the rooms that

841
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:07,719
they're in as a way of, uh, introducing

842
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:10,480
cold

843
00:35:07,719 --> 00:35:12,799
stress. Do we know what sorts of

844
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:15,358
targeted stress levels will have, you

845
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:18,359
know, what mechanisms create this

846
00:35:15,358 --> 00:35:18,358
effect?

847
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:24,000
That's a complicated question.

848
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:26,799
Um,

849
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,280
no, I mean in principle I can see why

850
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:31,039
people would try these things because of

851
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,839
course you're you're whenever you're

852
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:35,440
changing an environmental factor. Um,

853
00:35:33,838 --> 00:35:37,039
and that's essentially what you're doing

854
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:40,880
with all those things that you you you

855
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:43,358
you were mentioning there. Um, of course

856
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:46,800
the plant was will will respond to that

857
00:35:43,358 --> 00:35:48,159
in one or the other way. So yes, I mean

858
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,839
one of the first things that I would

859
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:52,000
bring up in that in in that point for

860
00:35:49,838 --> 00:35:53,559
example and I don't know if if there's

861
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:57,519
there's sort of

862
00:35:53,559 --> 00:36:00,400
more more trustworthy documentation or

863
00:35:57,519 --> 00:36:01,679
scientific work on that for for hemp but

864
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,880
of course you have to think about some

865
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:06,879
of this might also regulate

866
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:10,079
um flower induction

867
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:13,358
um how many flowers you get the ratio

868
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:14,480
between flowers and vegetative growth.

869
00:36:13,358 --> 00:36:16,319
It's kind of like you're you're

870
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,480
manipulating the growth of a plant in

871
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:22,960
the first place. Yeah. So that logically

872
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:25,838
has has some consequences there. Um so

873
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:27,838
that's one thing and yes I mean like I

874
00:36:25,838 --> 00:36:30,960
said before I mean certain abiotic

875
00:36:27,838 --> 00:36:34,960
factors will have consequences on on the

876
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:37,119
level of metabolites as well. Um, so yes

877
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,880
and I mean I'm very well aware that

878
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:40,640
people probably have done a lot of stuff

879
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,480
just by trial and error and trying to

880
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:44,480
play around with things with conditions

881
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:47,440
and see what the consequence of that is.

882
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:49,358
Yes. And that's not much different than

883
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,880
what we do on the science side of

884
00:36:49,358 --> 00:36:53,119
things. I wouldn't say we play around.

885
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:56,320
We normally start off with a clearly

886
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:58,079
defined hypothesis. But in the end we we

887
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:00,280
don't know things and then we test

888
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:02,400
things. uh just that we do it under much

889
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:05,200
more let's say a little bit more

890
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:07,838
controlled conditions and and and we do

891
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:10,559
it not just one time but we do a lot of

892
00:37:07,838 --> 00:37:13,358
replications and very thorough data

893
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:16,000
collection and then data analysis later

894
00:37:13,358 --> 00:37:17,838
on to really kind of verify or or reject

895
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,719
a hypothesis that you might have had

896
00:37:17,838 --> 00:37:23,679
before there but

897
00:37:19,719 --> 00:37:26,118
yes I'm not saying that that's not not

898
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:29,598
reasonable to assume that some of these

899
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:32,079
things would lead to to respective

900
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:33,920
consequences in the plant. Like I said

901
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:35,920
before, I mean, we initially we were

902
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:39,519
kind of considering abiotic factors in

903
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:41,599
our our work a little bit, but since the

904
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:43,679
initial results we got in the first year

905
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:45,838
or year and a half were much more

906
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:48,719
promising and interesting on the on the

907
00:37:45,838 --> 00:37:52,239
biotic side of things, we very quickly

908
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:54,159
then decided to primarily focus on that

909
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:56,159
uh in particular because that is also a

910
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:58,159
little bit more in alignment with other

911
00:37:56,159 --> 00:38:00,078
projects not related to camp and

912
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:02,399
cannabis that are ongoing in my lab

913
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:04,800
here. I I in general I work a lot with

914
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,720
plant insect interactions and so

915
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:10,720
logically once we saw respective

916
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:14,000
responses in in in in hemp plants to

917
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:16,480
insects we kind of focused primarily on

918
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,599
that.

919
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:21,760
I I I want to talk about that um next.

920
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:24,320
But one question I want to just propose

921
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:27,040
to you is something that the sort of my

922
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:30,000
approach to understanding this is plants

923
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:31,519
all have this genetic potential and when

924
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,199
we're cultivating and we're trying to

925
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:36,159
get them to reach this potential and

926
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:38,480
then any sort of stress that they have

927
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:40,960
while it may increase secondary

928
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:43,440
metabolite metabolites it could also

929
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:45,039
impact yields negatively because the

930
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:48,440
plant has a certain amount of resources

931
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:50,559
it can allocate. Now, I'm under the

932
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:53,838
philosophy, and please feel free to

933
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:57,078
correct me on this, that every facility,

934
00:38:53,838 --> 00:38:59,920
grower, cultivation I've ever been to

935
00:38:57,079 --> 00:39:02,560
has stress, plant stress just naturally

936
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:04,320
occurring. We haven't perfected this in

937
00:39:02,559 --> 00:39:05,679
real, I mean, in a growth chamber, maybe

938
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,280
you're able to get a lot closer to this,

939
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:09,519
but in the reality of cultivating it

940
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:11,359
commercially or even at home, we're

941
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:14,639
naturally going to have some of these

942
00:39:11,358 --> 00:39:17,440
stress events occur already. And so my

943
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:19,838
goal as a cultivator is to create the

944
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,920
best environment I can for the plant to

945
00:39:19,838 --> 00:39:23,759
reach its genetic potential and assume

946
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:26,358
that it's still going to have good

947
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,880
secondary metabolite

948
00:39:26,358 --> 00:39:30,319
production.

949
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:32,880
Um do you have any thoughts on that

950
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:36,640
approach versus this idea of you know

951
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,640
more targeted stress events?

952
00:39:38,358 --> 00:39:44,078
Um I think in general the take of get

953
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:47,160
providing the best environmental

954
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:50,240
conditions if you want to say

955
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:52,480
so is for sure the best way. You don't

956
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:55,759
want to intentionally harm your plants

957
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:58,320
because yes you're right. I mean um if

958
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:00,560
you do that in the in the wrong time or

959
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:03,480
in the wrong way you simply will will

960
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:07,440
sacrifice your yield overall.

961
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:09,119
um some targeted sort of treatment, if

962
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,119
you want to call it that way, at a

963
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:12,800
certain time point to sort of increase

964
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:15,760
the level of certain things that you

965
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:19,480
want to sort of achieve there. Yes, that

966
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:21,760
makes sense. But sort of from the get-go

967
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:24,800
intentionally stressing your plans all

968
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:26,560
the time, I would really not think that

969
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,880
that would be a particularly good idea.

970
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:30,480
Yeah. Um I mean initially you want to

971
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:33,838
make sure that your plant grows up

972
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:36,440
properly is in a good healthy condition

973
00:40:33,838 --> 00:40:39,599
um good good growth

974
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:41,599
stage if you then at some point set sort

975
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:44,079
of the right trigger through some

976
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:45,838
treatment of your growth conditions your

977
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:50,480
environmental conditions yes you might

978
00:40:45,838 --> 00:40:51,920
achieve something there but I mean this

979
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,960
is similar things you do with other

980
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:56,318
crops as well. Yeah I

981
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:58,440
mean but you got to be careful with

982
00:40:56,318 --> 00:41:00,559
that. I mean like just sort

983
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:02,240
of trying to harm your plant

984
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:05,199
intentionally for an extended period of

985
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:07,358
time is is probably not a good good idea

986
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:10,078
there in the first place. So so what

987
00:41:07,358 --> 00:41:11,679
you're saying is we may find that most

988
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:13,599
of and this is another thing is we have

989
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:15,279
such genetic diversity in cannabis that

990
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:16,800
we can't make the assumption that all

991
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,640
plants are going to reply you know

992
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,400
respond the same because of the

993
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:22,159
diversity that we see.

994
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:24,480
We may find that two weeks out from

995
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:29,039
harvest, for example, extreme drought

996
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:31,838
stress or extreme cold stress may have a

997
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:34,000
positive effect on secondary metabolite

998
00:41:31,838 --> 00:41:35,759
production without having as large of an

999
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,599
impact on yield and that might become

1000
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:40,160
best practice down the road, but we're

1001
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:43,599
not there yet. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, keep

1002
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:46,000
in mind you you you keep your plants um

1003
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:48,640
in a vegetative state for quite a while

1004
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,559
before then they start flowering. There

1005
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:52,639
is no sense in stressing your plants

1006
00:41:50,559 --> 00:41:55,039
while they're in the vegetative state. I

1007
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:57,759
mean, you want to have a good good base

1008
00:41:55,039 --> 00:41:59,599
line, so to say, of vegetative growth

1009
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:02,240
because that's the resources that you

1010
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:04,720
ultimately then can remobilize and put

1011
00:42:02,239 --> 00:42:07,519
into flowers in the end. Yeah. If you're

1012
00:42:04,719 --> 00:42:10,559
having a weak plant before, well, what's

1013
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:13,679
the sense of it? Yeah. Um there that's

1014
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:15,279
not going to work out well.

1015
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:16,480
That's that's a really good point. Yeah.

1016
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:20,440
So, we definitely don't want to create

1017
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:23,199
any stress early on in the plant's life.

1018
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:26,880
Um, okay. Well, let's uh let's talk a

1019
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:29,118
little bit about your research. So, we

1020
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:31,200
kind of hinted at it. Tell me a little

1021
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:32,960
bit about about what your sort of

1022
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:34,879
methodology was and what your results

1023
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:36,559
were.

1024
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,920
Yeah. So, I mean, this goes way back to

1025
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:40,000
what I said at the beginning a little

1026
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:42,800
bit, this chemical ecology approach. And

1027
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:45,358
of course, one of the the major stresses

1028
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:48,519
that any plant will face in its lifetime

1029
00:42:45,358 --> 00:42:53,279
is bibly biotic stress.

1030
00:42:48,519 --> 00:42:56,639
Um and and in particular insects,

1031
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:58,560
herbivy basically. Um of course we can

1032
00:42:56,639 --> 00:43:01,039
talk about herbivy in a little bit of

1033
00:42:58,559 --> 00:43:05,838
broader sense. I mean not herbivy is not

1034
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:07,679
just insects. Um, and I think this is um

1035
00:43:05,838 --> 00:43:10,480
something we might want to consider a

1036
00:43:07,679 --> 00:43:13,078
little bit more when we talk about hemp.

1037
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:16,960
Um, we can get get to back to that in in

1038
00:43:13,079 --> 00:43:20,480
in a few minutes. So, herbivy could be

1039
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:23,920
also by by other animals by mammals, by

1040
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:25,599
little rodents or rabbits or or goats or

1041
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:27,200
sheep or something like that. I mean, if

1042
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:30,079
you consider the size of a hemp plant,

1043
00:43:27,199 --> 00:43:32,559
it's not a tiny little plant. It's

1044
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:35,440
actually a quite substantial plant. So

1045
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:38,159
you can imagine that other animals would

1046
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:39,599
feed on a hemp plant as well. Not sure

1047
00:43:38,159 --> 00:43:42,399
if it the flowers, but definitely

1048
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:45,200
somewhere on the plant. Yeah. But

1049
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:47,200
definitely the other major factor that

1050
00:43:45,199 --> 00:43:51,480
kind of harms plants in that respect are

1051
00:43:47,199 --> 00:43:54,318
are all sorts of insects. Yeah. And so

1052
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:56,079
um and that's normally why plants

1053
00:43:54,318 --> 00:43:58,400
produce a lot of these specialized

1054
00:43:56,079 --> 00:44:02,480
metabolites basically fending off this

1055
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:05,599
herbivy. Uh so any herbivore that

1056
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:07,920
consumes some of the the the the the

1057
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:11,400
leaf material, the plant, the vegetative

1058
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:14,880
part, even it's if it's in the roots,

1059
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:17,480
um would be facing or would be exposed

1060
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:19,920
to such specialized or secondary

1061
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:22,719
metabolites. And that's no different for

1062
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:25,599
for for a hemp or cannabis plant. Yeah.

1063
00:44:22,719 --> 00:44:28,480
And so one of the the the the early on

1064
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:31,039
experiments that we did was we kind of

1065
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:32,880
initially mimicked herbivy and you can

1066
00:44:31,039 --> 00:44:35,358
do that by some chemical treatment

1067
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,960
basically that is a signaling compound

1068
00:44:35,358 --> 00:44:39,239
that's actually a plant normally

1069
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:42,079
produces itself when it's exposed to

1070
00:44:39,239 --> 00:44:44,159
herbivy and then we measured tpine and

1071
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:46,400
cannabonoid contents and we saw already

1072
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:48,159
that that led to an upper regulation.

1073
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:50,160
Yeah. And so that was a first clear

1074
00:44:48,159 --> 00:44:52,799
indication. Oh yeah, they're responding

1075
00:44:50,159 --> 00:44:54,318
to that. Which was not surprising. It's

1076
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:56,400
just easier to do that because it's

1077
00:44:54,318 --> 00:44:59,039
bitly you spray a chemical on the plant

1078
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:01,440
and you can see the response and you

1079
00:44:59,039 --> 00:45:03,440
don't actually need the actual insect

1080
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:05,200
feeding on the plant. But logically that

1081
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:07,358
was our next step. Once we saw this

1082
00:45:05,199 --> 00:45:09,199
first these first preliminary data and

1083
00:45:07,358 --> 00:45:13,639
seeing that the plant was responding to

1084
00:45:09,199 --> 00:45:16,639
that uh then of course we looked for

1085
00:45:13,639 --> 00:45:18,639
a an insect system that we could use on

1086
00:45:16,639 --> 00:45:20,480
hemp and we kind of looked around and

1087
00:45:18,639 --> 00:45:23,159
talked with some people from various

1088
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:26,079
extension services to see like what are

1089
00:45:23,159 --> 00:45:29,399
real world real insect pests that you're

1090
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:31,680
seeing in in in hemp and cannabis

1091
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:32,960
cultivation. And then of course we also

1092
00:45:31,679 --> 00:45:34,799
looked for something that's actually

1093
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:37,318
relevant and easy to get your hands on

1094
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:40,640
in our region here in in

1095
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:44,880
Appalachia. Um and it turns out actually

1096
00:45:40,639 --> 00:45:46,879
that beat armyworm was an a real pest

1097
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:49,440
that was an issue that that growers had

1098
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:52,318
to face and deal with. And at the same

1099
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:54,400
time there's a a small company that

1100
00:45:52,318 --> 00:45:57,279
rears these insects these these these

1101
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:58,720
larae and we can simply buy and they buy

1102
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:01,280
them from them and get them shipped

1103
00:45:58,719 --> 00:46:02,879
here. And there's no legal restrictions.

1104
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:04,240
You know, sometimes with pest insects,

1105
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:06,240
you got to be a little bit careful. You

1106
00:46:04,239 --> 00:46:07,838
can't just move them over said lines.

1107
00:46:06,239 --> 00:46:09,598
But in case of beat army one, that

1108
00:46:07,838 --> 00:46:11,679
wasn't a problem because it is already a

1109
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:13,280
natural pest here. So, we're not

1110
00:46:11,679 --> 00:46:16,399
introducing something that wouldn't be

1111
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:18,720
here. And so, we finally settled on on

1112
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:22,079
using them. So, we can we get little

1113
00:46:18,719 --> 00:46:24,000
caterpillars from that are pre-re. We

1114
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:25,920
keep them here for a little while and

1115
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,960
then we actually allow them to feed on

1116
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:31,519
our on our hemp plants. uh and they

1117
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:33,280
actually do quite a bit of damage um in

1118
00:46:31,519 --> 00:46:35,519
a relatively short amount of time. They

1119
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:37,880
they start off feeding on leaves but

1120
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:40,400
then at some point they also move to the

1121
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:43,119
flowers. We have damage on leaves and we

1122
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:45,519
also have damage on flowers and then

1123
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:47,200
under very controlled conditions how

1124
00:46:45,519 --> 00:46:49,679
kind of determined how long we had to

1125
00:46:47,199 --> 00:46:54,000
leave them on there and then measured

1126
00:46:49,679 --> 00:46:57,440
cannabonoid contents and indeed saw that

1127
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,838
cannaboid production um was quite

1128
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:01,519
significantly

1129
00:46:58,838 --> 00:47:05,519
upregulated and actually upregulated to

1130
00:47:01,519 --> 00:47:07,759
a level where we would be in violation

1131
00:47:05,519 --> 00:47:09,119
or could get into violation if we were

1132
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:11,440
would be growers.

1133
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:14,880
of the legal limit. Yeah. So that this

1134
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:19,519
clearly indicated that insect herbivy if

1135
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:21,440
you're growing CBD uh hemp um can be a

1136
00:47:19,519 --> 00:47:24,639
can be a problem for you as a grower.

1137
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:26,559
So, I mean, one of the easy to take

1138
00:47:24,639 --> 00:47:29,199
take-home messages from that work was

1139
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:31,920
already just yes, you got to scout for

1140
00:47:29,199 --> 00:47:33,759
insects, pest insects if you're growing,

1141
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:36,079
and you got to take care of that, which

1142
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:40,640
I know is not easy because depending on

1143
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:42,800
what time on life status or um of your

1144
00:47:40,639 --> 00:47:44,559
of your plants, you're you probably

1145
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:46,079
don't want to spray much because I mean,

1146
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:49,599
then you you're running into problems

1147
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:51,280
there again. But scouting early on,

1148
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:53,920
making sure you don't have a lot of

1149
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:56,560
herbivy and if so, take the right

1150
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:57,559
measures is definitely one of the one of

1151
00:47:56,559 --> 00:48:00,480
the core

1152
00:47:57,559 --> 00:48:02,719
things. So this this was the first

1153
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:05,800
finding, but then story kind of

1154
00:48:02,719 --> 00:48:09,838
developed a little bit more.

1155
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:13,760
Um, we saw that compounds, major

1156
00:48:09,838 --> 00:48:16,279
cannabonoids like THC, CBD, CBG, some of

1157
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:19,119
the those things were

1158
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:20,040
upregulated. But then we saw since we're

1159
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:23,200
in

1160
00:48:20,039 --> 00:48:25,440
our cannabonoid analysis, we're not just

1161
00:48:23,199 --> 00:48:28,639
seeing those major cannabonoids, but

1162
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:32,000
we're seeing a lot of other so-called

1163
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:34,558
minor cannabonoids as well. And what we

1164
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:38,559
were surprised is to see that those were

1165
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:40,240
also upregulated and actually also quite

1166
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:41,800
not all of them but some of them and

1167
00:48:40,239 --> 00:48:44,558
some of them actually quite

1168
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:47,039
significantly. So things that were in

1169
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:50,400
our analytics before tiny little peaks

1170
00:48:47,039 --> 00:48:53,358
and difficult to detect were very

1171
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:56,680
detectable afterwards. So significantly

1172
00:48:53,358 --> 00:49:00,078
upregulated and increased and that of

1173
00:48:56,679 --> 00:49:02,239
course we we got really excited about

1174
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:05,280
that and and sort of draw our attention

1175
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:07,558
to uh because like we were wondering

1176
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:11,680
like what the heck is going on

1177
00:49:07,559 --> 00:49:12,519
there and tpines were also upregulated

1178
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:17,318
but

1179
00:49:12,519 --> 00:49:19,639
not all of them and also not to an

1180
00:49:17,318 --> 00:49:23,199
extent that was

1181
00:49:19,639 --> 00:49:25,679
really very extreme. Yeah, it was a

1182
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:28,039
little bit of an up regulation, but um

1183
00:49:25,679 --> 00:49:30,159
nothing really that that was

1184
00:49:28,039 --> 00:49:32,719
particularly didn't knock me out of my

1185
00:49:30,159 --> 00:49:35,759
shoes that way. And that was a little

1186
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:38,558
bit surprising because we originally had

1187
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:41,040
my expectation when we started this was

1188
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:42,720
that rather the tarpen might be

1189
00:49:41,039 --> 00:49:45,199
affecting insects because that's what

1190
00:49:42,719 --> 00:49:46,799
they do in a lot of other plants. So I

1191
00:49:45,199 --> 00:49:49,039
have a couple of other projects where we

1192
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:51,119
do similar things and very often

1193
00:49:49,039 --> 00:49:52,400
turppins or some turppines are the ones

1194
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:54,838
that are actually really kind of

1195
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:57,760
affecting insects. And so my

1196
00:49:54,838 --> 00:50:00,400
initial assumption or expectation or

1197
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:02,079
hypothesis was that yeah in hemp it's

1198
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:06,119
probably also going to be turbines being

1199
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:09,280
involved in that. And from the first

1200
00:50:06,119 --> 00:50:10,720
results it did not look quite like that.

1201
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:13,680
I'm I don't want to exclude that the

1202
00:50:10,719 --> 00:50:16,399
tpines play no role but it was that that

1203
00:50:13,679 --> 00:50:18,719
the response on the cannabonoid side was

1204
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:20,400
much more significant than than what we

1205
00:50:18,719 --> 00:50:23,519
saw on the tarpine side and that was a

1206
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:25,760
little unexpected.

1207
00:50:23,519 --> 00:50:27,079
Okay, I have a few a few questions from

1208
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:31,920
that.

1209
00:50:27,079 --> 00:50:35,200
Um first question is in relation to the

1210
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:38,720
tarpen are we talking you know a

1211
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:41,919
statistically significant increase?

1212
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:43,759
Yes. Yes. For some of them, not all of

1213
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:46,400
them. Yeah. But for some of them, it was

1214
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:49,280
a significant increase, but it was from

1215
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:51,519
the extent was not as dramatic as some

1216
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:53,920
of the the the responses we saw on the

1217
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:55,599
cannabonoid side. In in in case of some

1218
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:58,159
of the cannabonoids, we see like a

1219
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:59,599
five-fold increase. That was my next

1220
00:50:58,159 --> 00:51:01,838
question. So, you're you're saying

1221
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:04,640
massive increases. Okay. Really massive

1222
00:51:01,838 --> 00:51:07,519
increases. Yeah. Uh I'm not saying THC

1223
00:51:04,639 --> 00:51:09,598
necessarily or CBD, but some of the

1224
00:51:07,519 --> 00:51:11,119
other things we really see like quite

1225
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:14,079
significant increases and with the

1226
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:15,760
turppines we maybe see a one and a

1227
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:19,599
halffold increase or something like

1228
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:22,000
that. Yeah. So by far not as dramatic.

1229
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:23,760
Yeah. I'm not saying that that they

1230
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,599
don't play any role, but it was really

1231
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:27,720
not kind of quite what we had expected

1232
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:31,359
initially.

1233
00:51:27,719 --> 00:51:34,078
Um, so that got us really kind of like a

1234
00:51:31,358 --> 00:51:36,119
little bit wondering what the heck is

1235
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:39,599
going on there.

1236
00:51:36,119 --> 00:51:42,480
Um, and of course whenever you find

1237
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:44,640
something like that, of course we want

1238
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:46,480
to understand why that biologically

1239
00:51:44,639 --> 00:51:49,759
makes sense. Why do you have these

1240
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:52,079
upregulation of cannabonoids there? Um,

1241
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:54,559
what is it doing? And that brings me

1242
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:58,200
back to what we were talking about

1243
00:51:54,559 --> 00:52:01,040
before with the herbyss. Yeah.

1244
00:51:58,199 --> 00:52:04,759
So, if if you have an upregulation of

1245
00:52:01,039 --> 00:52:08,239
THC or CBD and your herbivore is a

1246
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:12,000
mammal, I'm not saying a human, but a

1247
00:52:08,239 --> 00:52:15,759
mammal, a little rodent. Um, you can

1248
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:19,039
explain how that might affect that

1249
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:21,839
herbivore. Yeah, they do have the same

1250
00:52:19,039 --> 00:52:23,440
cannabonoid receptors that we have and

1251
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:25,920
I'm not saying they're getting a high,

1252
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:28,720
but they're for sure going to have some

1253
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:30,800
some experience there or some exposure

1254
00:52:28,719 --> 00:52:32,639
to it and would probably kind of

1255
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:34,720
reconsider feeding on that plant the

1256
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:35,960
next time potentially. So, you can see

1257
00:52:34,719 --> 00:52:38,759
how that would

1258
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:41,920
work. Interesting thing is with

1259
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:44,319
insects, they don't have the cannabonoid

1260
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:46,720
receptors that we and other mammals

1261
00:52:44,318 --> 00:52:48,159
have.

1262
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:52,118
And that of course brings up the

1263
00:52:48,159 --> 00:52:54,480
question like then how does it affect

1264
00:52:52,119 --> 00:52:57,880
insects? Are there cannabonoids that

1265
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:57,880
affect insects?

1266
00:52:58,519 --> 00:53:06,079
Is so so one thing I was wondering is

1267
00:53:01,199 --> 00:53:08,480
how targeted is is are plants able to

1268
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:10,800
distinguish in regards to like how

1269
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:12,719
targeted is their approach defensive

1270
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:15,200
approach. So like for example, can a

1271
00:53:12,719 --> 00:53:18,719
plant distinguish between thris damage

1272
00:53:15,199 --> 00:53:22,078
and caterpillar damage and maybe for

1273
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:24,639
thris it may increase tarpen whereas

1274
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:26,800
caterpillars it focuses on cannonoids.

1275
00:53:24,639 --> 00:53:28,318
Is that a possibility or are plants not

1276
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:30,559
able to tell if I'm cutting it with

1277
00:53:28,318 --> 00:53:31,599
scissors or if it's I mean I assume

1278
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:33,119
there's some sort of chemical

1279
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:35,280
interaction happening like you mentioned

1280
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:38,000
with being able to spray something to

1281
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:40,240
get a similar plant response.

1282
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,079
Well, the first thing that that the the

1283
00:53:40,239 --> 00:53:44,558
first thing you can distinguish on the

1284
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:45,839
insect side is is what type of insect

1285
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:47,400
you have there. And you brought two

1286
00:53:45,838 --> 00:53:49,920
examples up there. The one is

1287
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:52,800
caterpillars, which fall into the group

1288
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:54,480
of so-called biting chewing insects. So,

1289
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:56,880
they actually really consume leaf

1290
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:59,000
tissue. They bite into tissue and munch

1291
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:01,680
it up basically.

1292
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:03,838
Um the other example that you had was

1293
00:54:01,679 --> 00:54:06,239
thris or you could add a couple of these

1294
00:54:03,838 --> 00:54:08,358
other things like aphits,

1295
00:54:06,239 --> 00:54:10,558
uh white flies,

1296
00:54:08,358 --> 00:54:13,519
spidermitites. The those are generally

1297
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:16,880
kind of considered as as as piercing

1298
00:54:13,519 --> 00:54:20,960
sucking insects. So they either feed on

1299
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:23,358
the the the the the vascular tissue or

1300
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:25,599
the content of it or they actually suck

1301
00:54:23,358 --> 00:54:29,279
out cell content. So they puncture

1302
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:31,359
individual cells and like

1303
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:33,519
suck the content of the cell up. That is

1304
00:54:31,358 --> 00:54:35,679
a completely different type of feeding

1305
00:54:33,519 --> 00:54:37,440
so to say and the damage that you you're

1306
00:54:35,679 --> 00:54:38,519
you you're seeing is a completely

1307
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:42,760
different

1308
00:54:38,519 --> 00:54:44,358
one. So we did not see much

1309
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:47,440
response

1310
00:54:44,358 --> 00:54:50,558
with piercing sucking insects although

1311
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:52,880
we have not really used them a lot. I

1312
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:55,519
know some people have seen effects when

1313
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:57,280
they were using aphits. Uh so I don't

1314
00:54:55,519 --> 00:54:58,838
want to exclude that but we haven't seen

1315
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:01,599
that in our

1316
00:54:58,838 --> 00:55:04,719
analysis. So we primarily kind of

1317
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:07,000
concentrated on on on biting chewing

1318
00:55:04,719 --> 00:55:10,078
insects that really have consumable

1319
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:11,280
tissue. Um we actually have used a

1320
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:13,359
couple different ones in the meanwhile

1321
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:15,920
and we we see the same response. So

1322
00:55:13,358 --> 00:55:19,598
we're pretty sure that that is pretty

1323
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:21,119
uniform there. Um so and that is

1324
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:22,960
something that the plant can can

1325
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:24,559
distinct. Yeah. I mean there is a

1326
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:27,838
difference in difference in the response

1327
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:30,160
of plants if they're sort of um

1328
00:55:27,838 --> 00:55:32,159
experiencing herbivy by abiding chewing

1329
00:55:30,159 --> 00:55:34,078
insects versus a piercing sucking even

1330
00:55:32,159 --> 00:55:36,000
though the the sort of the the signaling

1331
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:37,680
within the plant is different when

1332
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,920
they're exposed to these diff different

1333
00:55:37,679 --> 00:55:41,358
types of insects. But you're right. I

1334
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:44,559
mean what the other thing that you just

1335
00:55:41,358 --> 00:55:46,880
mentioned before is so what the plant

1336
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:48,960
can perceive is not just this when you

1337
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:51,280
have a caterpillar or a beetle nibbling

1338
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:53,960
around there it's not just the wounding

1339
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:56,280
of tissue the plant can

1340
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:59,358
actually

1341
00:55:56,280 --> 00:56:02,240
recognize the insect side of things as

1342
00:55:59,358 --> 00:56:05,558
well. So plants do have per se in

1343
00:56:02,239 --> 00:56:08,000
general have receptors for the saliva of

1344
00:56:05,559 --> 00:56:11,359
insects. Uh so it's not just the

1345
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:13,760
wounding. Um there is publications not

1346
00:56:11,358 --> 00:56:16,759
from hemp but from other plants where

1347
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:20,160
plants can perceive the feces of

1348
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:21,680
insects. So very often if there's a

1349
00:56:20,159 --> 00:56:24,318
caterpillar or a beetle or something

1350
00:56:21,679 --> 00:56:27,118
like roaming around on a plant, they

1351
00:56:24,318 --> 00:56:29,119
leave their they basically defecate on

1352
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:30,720
the plant. They leave their feces behind

1353
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:34,160
and there's things in there that the

1354
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:37,230
plant can recognize. So, uh, plants can

1355
00:56:34,159 --> 00:56:38,440
recognize quite a lot of things,

1356
00:56:37,230 --> 00:56:41,920
[Music]

1357
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:43,760
um, sort of traces that an insect would

1358
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:46,318
leave behind if it's on a plant and

1359
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:48,480
feeding there.

1360
00:56:46,318 --> 00:56:50,639
So, someone might develop a caterpillar

1361
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:53,280
feces spray someday that we could spray

1362
00:56:50,639 --> 00:56:56,239
on our plant to get upregulation of

1363
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:58,319
secondary metabolites. In theory, in

1364
00:56:56,239 --> 00:57:00,000
theory, yes. I can tell you from from

1365
00:56:58,318 --> 00:57:03,838
research that people have actually

1366
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:05,920
collected the saliva of insects and have

1367
00:57:03,838 --> 00:57:08,078
diluted that and sprayed it on plants

1368
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:09,838
and that led to a response with even

1369
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:11,280
without the wounding but you can combine

1370
00:57:09,838 --> 00:57:13,119
it with the wounding and then you even

1371
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:14,640
get a stronger response. So there's

1372
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:16,720
there there's some good literature out

1373
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:18,480
there, not from hemp necessarily or

1374
00:57:16,719 --> 00:57:20,399
cannabis, but from other plants. But I

1375
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:22,639
mean, this is by now it's pretty

1376
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:24,400
accepted that that's a pretty general

1377
00:57:22,639 --> 00:57:26,879
response of plants that they're capable

1378
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:28,079
of recognizing these sorts of things.

1379
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:29,760
Yes.

1380
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:31,359
So, one other thing you touched on I

1381
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:32,839
just want to highlight and make sure I

1382
00:57:31,358 --> 00:57:37,838
understand

1383
00:57:32,838 --> 00:57:39,199
is this idea that um chewing insects

1384
00:57:37,838 --> 00:57:42,960
like the caterpillars that you worked

1385
00:57:39,199 --> 00:57:44,558
with created a much higher response uh

1386
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:46,880
in terms of secondary metabolite

1387
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:50,480
production than sucking piercing

1388
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:52,720
insects. Um, so the practical

1389
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:56,240
application of this might be if you are

1390
00:57:52,719 --> 00:58:00,798
seeing aphids in your hemp grow that may

1391
00:57:56,239 --> 00:58:02,639
be less concerning than caterpillars or

1392
00:58:00,798 --> 00:58:04,960
rodent damage or other things in terms

1393
00:58:02,639 --> 00:58:08,879
of the THC response that you may see

1394
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:11,920
from that herbivy in in theory just pure

1395
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:13,920
hypothesis in theory. I mean like I said

1396
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:16,798
we did not see a response when we

1397
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:19,599
mimicked aphit feeding so to say and

1398
00:58:16,798 --> 00:58:21,519
again we never used aphits we mimicked

1399
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:23,680
this kind of feeding with with with some

1400
00:58:21,519 --> 00:58:25,519
treatments there we did not see a

1401
00:58:23,679 --> 00:58:28,558
response there but I'm aware that there

1402
00:58:25,519 --> 00:58:31,599
are some reports from other groups where

1403
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:33,519
they did see a response of plants upon

1404
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:35,838
aphid feeding so I don't want to

1405
00:58:33,519 --> 00:58:38,039
completely exclude that I I I can't just

1406
00:58:35,838 --> 00:58:40,719
say we did not see it but that doesn't

1407
00:58:38,039 --> 00:58:42,079
mean this be could be again your what

1408
00:58:40,719 --> 00:58:44,519
you mentioned before your genetic

1409
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:46,798
diversity basically maybe there are some

1410
00:58:44,519 --> 00:58:49,599
varieties where you see that response

1411
00:58:46,798 --> 00:58:52,480
and others not. Uh of course we only

1412
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:55,280
used a few hemp varieties and not not

1413
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:58,599
too many. I mean we it it needs to be

1414
00:58:55,280 --> 00:59:01,839
manageable for on our side.

1415
00:58:58,599 --> 00:59:03,920
Um I mean I wouldn't generalize it as

1416
00:59:01,838 --> 00:59:06,318
you said. I mean, you're you might be

1417
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:09,119
right that I would be more concerned

1418
00:59:06,318 --> 00:59:11,039
about about sort of herbivy by

1419
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:13,039
caterpillars or beetles or so biting

1420
00:59:11,039 --> 00:59:16,159
chewing insects if you're concerned

1421
00:59:13,039 --> 00:59:18,759
about your THC level. I would not say

1422
00:59:16,159 --> 00:59:22,000
that I would not be worried about aphid

1423
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:24,799
infestation. Um the problem in general

1424
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:28,480
is that piercing sucking insects very

1425
00:59:24,798 --> 00:59:31,119
often serve as vectors for uh for

1426
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:33,679
viruses. So even a very low level of

1427
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:35,519
infestation can create a lot of problems

1428
00:59:33,679 --> 00:59:38,598
because once your plants are infested

1429
00:59:35,519 --> 00:59:44,239
with a virus

1430
00:59:38,599 --> 00:59:46,000
um there's no cure. Yeah. Um and so you

1431
00:59:44,239 --> 00:59:48,719
definitely as a grower you definitely

1432
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:51,280
should should scout for for these

1433
00:59:48,719 --> 00:59:54,078
insects as well very carefully and and

1434
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:57,359
take respensic respective measures if

1435
00:59:54,079 --> 00:59:59,519
you if you find them on on your plants.

1436
00:59:57,358 --> 01:00:01,598
uh because any of these little critters

1437
00:59:59,519 --> 01:00:03,318
can can barely make your plant sick and

1438
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:06,798
then then you really got a problem

1439
01:00:03,318 --> 01:00:09,358
there. Um maybe not because of the THC

1440
01:00:06,798 --> 01:00:11,519
level but maybe because of the the the

1441
01:00:09,358 --> 01:00:13,358
status overall status of your plants

1442
01:00:11,519 --> 01:00:15,838
basically and your entire facility.

1443
01:00:13,358 --> 01:00:17,759
That's the other thing. Sure. And in

1444
01:00:15,838 --> 01:00:20,159
general pathogens are pretty devastating

1445
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:22,319
to crops but have you seen any research

1446
01:00:20,159 --> 01:00:24,719
of pathogens increasing secondary

1447
01:00:22,318 --> 01:00:26,798
metabolite production?

1448
01:00:24,719 --> 01:00:29,919
I personally not I mean we never worked

1449
01:00:26,798 --> 01:00:32,079
with pathogens. Um okay I'm not

1450
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:35,599
necessarily aware of a lot of literature

1451
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:38,960
but um I don't want to exclude it um at

1452
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:41,039
all. Again tpines definitely have an

1453
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:42,798
effect on pathogens. We're currently

1454
01:00:41,039 --> 01:00:44,639
working on something similar here with

1455
01:00:42,798 --> 01:00:48,639
in collaboration with another group here

1456
01:00:44,639 --> 01:00:51,558
with tomatoes. Um and it's there's

1457
01:00:48,639 --> 01:00:55,440
plenty literature

1458
01:00:51,559 --> 01:00:57,839
um where tip beans have have been shown

1459
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:59,838
to have badly in general antimicrobial

1460
01:00:57,838 --> 01:01:04,798
activity which includes bacteria and and

1461
01:00:59,838 --> 01:01:07,119
and fungi or pathogens. Um so I'm not

1462
01:01:04,798 --> 01:01:08,559
aware that cannabonoids are having

1463
01:01:07,119 --> 01:01:10,240
similar effects but I don't want to

1464
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:12,640
completely exclude it. I'm just not

1465
01:01:10,239 --> 01:01:15,279
aware of it but the tpines definitely

1466
01:01:12,639 --> 01:01:17,759
have quite dramatic effects there. So

1467
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:21,359
that that could very well have have an

1468
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:23,440
effect in in hemp and cannabis as well.

1469
01:01:21,358 --> 01:01:26,558
Now now cannabis seems to respond pretty

1470
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:31,519
well to uh pretty aggressive pruning,

1471
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:33,680
mechanical pruning. Uh would that I'm

1472
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:35,440
learning today about how a plant can

1473
01:01:33,679 --> 01:01:38,078
sense all of these other aspects of

1474
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:40,079
herbivy. So I had I had assumed that

1475
01:01:38,079 --> 01:01:42,720
what we when we were pruning heavily we

1476
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:45,920
were mimicking at least certain aspects

1477
01:01:42,719 --> 01:01:49,598
of herbivy. But what are your thoughts

1478
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:51,920
on that? I guess can we create these

1479
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:55,039
similar mimic mimicry?

1480
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:57,358
Um so any type of wounding of your pl of

1481
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:59,798
a plant in principle kind of has

1482
01:01:57,358 --> 01:02:02,400
somewhat of that effect or can have that

1483
01:01:59,798 --> 01:02:06,318
effect. But one thing you have to keep

1484
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:09,358
in mind is that if you do pruning or do

1485
01:02:06,318 --> 01:02:11,838
by accident wound your plant one time

1486
01:02:09,358 --> 01:02:14,400
that might very briefly induce something

1487
01:02:11,838 --> 01:02:17,679
but it's a a lot of this is happening on

1488
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:20,000
a time scale basically. So if you wound

1489
01:02:17,679 --> 01:02:22,318
a leaf you might see a little induction

1490
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:25,039
but that drops back down to baseline

1491
01:02:22,318 --> 01:02:27,920
level very quickly with I wouldn't say

1492
01:02:25,039 --> 01:02:31,679
within hours but within a day or so very

1493
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:33,200
quickly. So for a more substantial up

1494
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:35,519
regulation

1495
01:02:33,199 --> 01:02:39,039
um you would have to have a little bit

1496
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:41,199
more a persistent and ongoing sort of

1497
01:02:39,039 --> 01:02:42,960
process and that's normally what you

1498
01:02:41,199 --> 01:02:45,838
rather face if you have an infestation

1499
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:47,679
with a herbivore. Yeah, a herbivore

1500
01:02:45,838 --> 01:02:49,199
normally doesn't just come by bite in

1501
01:02:47,679 --> 01:02:51,679
one leaf and then move on and go

1502
01:02:49,199 --> 01:02:55,679
somewhere else. It normally stays on

1503
01:02:51,679 --> 01:02:57,759
your plant for quite a bit of time. And

1504
01:02:55,679 --> 01:03:00,798
unfortunately, a lot of insects have the

1505
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:02,720
ability to propagate very quickly. And

1506
01:03:00,798 --> 01:03:04,559
so you're not going to have just one

1507
01:03:02,719 --> 01:03:05,679
insect nibbling on your plant, but in no

1508
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:08,079
matter of time, you're probably going to

1509
01:03:05,679 --> 01:03:10,159
have multiple insects nibbling on your

1510
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:12,960
plant. And then that that is this

1511
01:03:10,159 --> 01:03:14,798
persistent ongoing herbivy. And that of

1512
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:18,240
course leads to a completely different

1513
01:03:14,798 --> 01:03:20,000
response. Yeah. From the extent that you

1514
01:03:18,239 --> 01:03:22,078
Yeah. Okay. That's really interesting

1515
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:25,679
because when I when I think about it

1516
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:29,039
like as a as a indoor cultivator, we

1517
01:03:25,679 --> 01:03:32,318
tend to have to do uh defoliation of

1518
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:34,240
most most genetic cultivars uh just to

1519
01:03:32,318 --> 01:03:35,759
increase the amount of light and air

1520
01:03:34,239 --> 01:03:37,919
that's getting the plant and maximize

1521
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:40,799
our photosynthesis and reduce the risk

1522
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:43,838
of pathogens and and pest pressure by

1523
01:03:40,798 --> 01:03:46,719
having microclimates inside our canopy.

1524
01:03:43,838 --> 01:03:47,798
Um but what you're saying is when we do

1525
01:03:46,719 --> 01:03:50,480
that we

1526
01:03:47,798 --> 01:03:52,880
me certain plant responses but they're

1527
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:55,920
short-lived whereas that insect is going

1528
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:57,680
to be constantly nibbling and so it's

1529
01:03:55,920 --> 01:04:00,960
essentially just keeping the plant

1530
01:03:57,679 --> 01:04:02,798
stressed the entire time so you see

1531
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:04,960
upregulation of that over a longer

1532
01:04:02,798 --> 01:04:07,440
period which is more likely to lead to

1533
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:10,639
these increases in metabolite

1534
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:13,119
production. Ah exact exactly. Yeah. So I

1535
01:04:10,639 --> 01:04:15,598
I one time pruning yeah you might see a

1536
01:04:13,119 --> 01:04:17,519
little bit of an effect there but it's

1537
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:20,880
not going to be very persistent versus

1538
01:04:17,519 --> 01:04:23,599
if you have an a past infestation which

1539
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:25,039
normally lasts for quite a bit of time

1540
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:27,280
then you're probably going to see much

1541
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:28,119
more of it. The other question of course

1542
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:31,440
is

1543
01:04:28,119 --> 01:04:34,160
also at what time of the sort of the the

1544
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:36,559
the the growth cycle are you going to

1545
01:04:34,159 --> 01:04:39,519
have that? Yeah, I would assume your

1546
01:04:36,559 --> 01:04:41,519
pruning you do not on the very last

1547
01:04:39,519 --> 01:04:43,280
stage of before you harvest. You

1548
01:04:41,519 --> 01:04:44,719
probably would do that sometimes earlier

1549
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:46,798
because you kind of like like you

1550
01:04:44,719 --> 01:04:49,199
described, you kind of want to get

1551
01:04:46,798 --> 01:04:51,358
maximum light exposure. You want to have

1552
01:04:49,199 --> 01:04:53,759
air flow in there and maybe avoid these

1553
01:04:51,358 --> 01:04:55,159
microclimates, etc., etc. You're

1554
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:57,680
probably not going to do that in the

1555
01:04:55,159 --> 01:04:58,719
very two days before you harvest. Yeah,

1556
01:04:57,679 --> 01:05:01,798
you're going to do that while you're

1557
01:04:58,719 --> 01:05:05,038
cultivating, while you're growing.

1558
01:05:01,798 --> 01:05:07,280
Um, so as long as you do that sort of in

1559
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:09,039
the more vegetative part of the the the

1560
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:11,680
growth stage, you're not going to have

1561
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:13,520
much of an effect. Yeah. But if you have

1562
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:16,558
that in the very last stage shortly

1563
01:05:13,519 --> 01:05:19,038
before you start um harvesting anything,

1564
01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:20,640
then of course and and then if it's

1565
01:05:19,039 --> 01:05:23,680
extended, then you might see much more

1566
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:26,318
of an effect. Yeah. So it really it's

1567
01:05:23,679 --> 01:05:28,159
the timing and and and the frequency of

1568
01:05:26,318 --> 01:05:30,960
sort of the these events happening that

1569
01:05:28,159 --> 01:05:32,719
might have an influence there. Yeah. I I

1570
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:34,798
I think there's a balance there. And we

1571
01:05:32,719 --> 01:05:36,639
do a pretty big defoliation, say like

1572
01:05:34,798 --> 01:05:40,639
week three of flower, week two, right

1573
01:05:36,639 --> 01:05:42,719
around there. Um but then I I I like to

1574
01:05:40,639 --> 01:05:47,038
go through and just pick leaves when I'm

1575
01:05:42,719 --> 01:05:48,480
in my when I'm in my grow um as I'm

1576
01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:51,119
going through it because the plants

1577
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:53,199
always respond bounce back so quickly.

1578
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:55,200
And I wonder if that might actually have

1579
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:57,118
some benefit. Though the downside of

1580
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:59,358
this, just to make people aware, when

1581
01:05:57,119 --> 01:06:02,160
you're doing any sort of wounding, you

1582
01:05:59,358 --> 01:06:04,558
are opening yourself up to greater risk

1583
01:06:02,159 --> 01:06:06,239
of pathogens. You've created a perfect

1584
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:08,480
place for pathogens get your plants. So,

1585
01:06:06,239 --> 01:06:10,159
there's there's pros and cons to it, I

1586
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:12,400
suppose. We may see increased benefit

1587
01:06:10,159 --> 01:06:14,960
from herbivy, but we may see, you know,

1588
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:18,720
a massive a higher risk of of pathogen

1589
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:20,639
pressure. Um well on a on a very on a

1590
01:06:18,719 --> 01:06:23,358
very practical side I mean if you're

1591
01:06:20,639 --> 01:06:25,598
using tools for doing your pruning uh

1592
01:06:23,358 --> 01:06:27,759
you want to be very careful because you

1593
01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:31,680
could be spreading diseases from one

1594
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:34,079
plant that is affected infected to

1595
01:06:31,679 --> 01:06:37,679
others just using the same clippers.

1596
01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:39,760
Yeah absolutely

1597
01:06:37,679 --> 01:06:41,279
even without any pests. So I I I mean

1598
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:42,720
like we're always very careful with

1599
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:45,359
these sorts of things. I mean, you want

1600
01:06:42,719 --> 01:06:47,358
to wash and sanitize your your tools

1601
01:06:45,358 --> 01:06:48,960
that you're using in in in your in your

1602
01:06:47,358 --> 01:06:51,038
growth facility if you're moving around

1603
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:52,480
and you're maybe already suspecting that

1604
01:06:51,039 --> 01:06:54,720
you have something that's diseased

1605
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:56,159
somewhere in there because otherwise you

1606
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:57,598
don't need any other factor for

1607
01:06:56,159 --> 01:06:59,440
spreading things is actually you

1608
01:06:57,599 --> 01:07:02,079
spreading things from one plant to the

1609
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:05,679
next. Yes. And and insects can be a

1610
01:07:02,079 --> 01:07:07,119
vector too for folks. So, um I I do have

1611
01:07:05,679 --> 01:07:08,879
a couple other questions. I want to

1612
01:07:07,119 --> 01:07:13,318
totally switch gears, but I'm looking at

1613
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:16,000
an article about you in greenhouse uh

1614
01:07:13,318 --> 01:07:18,639
management on online here, and one of

1615
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:20,318
the things that it mentions is that your

1616
01:07:18,639 --> 01:07:22,639
lab was studying interactions between

1617
01:07:20,318 --> 01:07:25,159
microisal fungi and plant roots and how

1618
01:07:22,639 --> 01:07:27,358
that impacts cannabonoid production or

1619
01:07:25,159 --> 01:07:28,719
accumulation. Can you just touch on that

1620
01:07:27,358 --> 01:07:30,078
because I know we've been talking for a

1621
01:07:28,719 --> 01:07:33,519
while, maybe I'll have to have you back

1622
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:36,000
on, but can you touch briefly on that?

1623
01:07:33,519 --> 01:07:39,358
Well, that was one one idea initially

1624
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:41,760
and that really didn't get too far. Um,

1625
01:07:39,358 --> 01:07:44,480
we had we had another group here in in

1626
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:49,119
in my college here that that that is is

1627
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:51,599
is is working on on microisal fungi. We

1628
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:54,318
actually for quite a number of years we

1629
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:57,599
were hosting what's called INVAM which

1630
01:07:54,318 --> 01:07:59,440
is one of the largest uh um

1631
01:07:57,599 --> 01:08:03,599
international national and international

1632
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:05,838
collection of microisal fungi here. Um

1633
01:08:03,599 --> 01:08:09,039
the in the meanwhile since the faculty

1634
01:08:05,838 --> 01:08:12,599
that was in charge of that retired um

1635
01:08:09,039 --> 01:08:16,640
that has moved on and is now in Kansas

1636
01:08:12,599 --> 01:08:18,159
um but um we still had some of that

1637
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:21,679
collection here and we were just trying

1638
01:08:18,158 --> 01:08:23,679
to play around with that to see if micro

1639
01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:27,838
actually how good they interact with

1640
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:29,838
hemp or not. Um and we ran into quite a

1641
01:08:27,838 --> 01:08:32,079
quite a bit of roadblocks there. I'm not

1642
01:08:29,838 --> 01:08:34,399
saying it doesn't work at all, but that

1643
01:08:32,079 --> 01:08:37,759
was kind of not

1644
01:08:34,399 --> 01:08:39,759
um particularly too easy to work it out.

1645
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:42,399
Uh in particular, because for the

1646
01:08:39,759 --> 01:08:44,798
purpose of how we need to how we need to

1647
01:08:42,399 --> 01:08:46,559
do these inoculations,

1648
01:08:44,798 --> 01:08:49,119
uh for the for the research side of

1649
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:51,080
things, the growth conditions, the hemp

1650
01:08:49,119 --> 01:08:53,519
plants really didn't like

1651
01:08:51,079 --> 01:08:55,759
particularly. Um, so I'm not saying that

1652
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:59,520
microisal fungi would not interact with

1653
01:08:55,759 --> 01:09:01,520
with the roots of of hemp plants, but

1654
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:05,239
under the conditions that these folks

1655
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:07,359
here wanted to grow the plants for

1656
01:09:05,238 --> 01:09:08,959
inoculation, the hemp plants just didn't

1657
01:09:07,359 --> 01:09:11,120
like the condition particularly. So, we

1658
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:15,439
kind of gave up a little bit at at some

1659
01:09:11,119 --> 01:09:17,039
point following up on that. Um, so um

1660
01:09:15,439 --> 01:09:19,198
can't really tell you much about that.

1661
01:09:17,039 --> 01:09:21,359
What I can tell you what we're currently

1662
01:09:19,198 --> 01:09:24,158
doing and that follows a little bit more

1663
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:27,079
on along the the the lines of what is

1664
01:09:24,158 --> 01:09:30,479
what I was describing before with

1665
01:09:27,079 --> 01:09:33,359
herbivy. We're currently looking into um

1666
01:09:30,479 --> 01:09:37,519
interaction of nematodes

1667
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:40,159
um with um the roots of hemp plants

1668
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:43,920
uh because that could that could lead to

1669
01:09:40,158 --> 01:09:46,479
a very similar response as the herbivy

1670
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:49,440
uh and we have some promising results in

1671
01:09:46,479 --> 01:09:51,278
that. Um we're following up on that

1672
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:53,759
right now and I hope in the next couple

1673
01:09:51,279 --> 01:09:55,760
weeks we can actually collect some more

1674
01:09:53,759 --> 01:09:58,079
samples and then do some more analysis

1675
01:09:55,760 --> 01:10:00,920
on that. So, we're looking a little bit

1676
01:09:58,079 --> 01:10:03,359
into that because that could be another

1677
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:05,920
point where you could have one of these

1678
01:10:03,359 --> 01:10:07,519
biotic interactions. And I mean, you're

1679
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:10,279
probably not going to see neat hose if

1680
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:13,360
you're growing in a controlled

1681
01:10:10,279 --> 01:10:15,439
environment. Uh, but if you have your

1682
01:10:13,359 --> 01:10:17,679
your your hemp or cannabis plants

1683
01:10:15,439 --> 01:10:19,119
growing in a field situation, you're

1684
01:10:17,679 --> 01:10:22,719
definitely going to see nematodeses. I

1685
01:10:19,119 --> 01:10:24,719
mean there's nothing you can do about um

1686
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:26,960
what species of nematodes are you

1687
01:10:24,719 --> 01:10:29,039
talking like root not nematodeses or

1688
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:30,640
what exactly and we're testing a couple

1689
01:10:29,039 --> 01:10:33,920
different ones but yeah that's that's

1690
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:35,600
one of them we're testing there so um

1691
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:38,079
and that is a little bit on the

1692
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:40,079
backdrops and got to go back a little

1693
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:42,479
bit to what what I said before so once

1694
01:10:40,079 --> 01:10:44,880
we had seen with the insect herbivy that

1695
01:10:42,479 --> 01:10:47,678
we had this massive regulation of some

1696
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:48,800
of these minor cannabonoids we curtis

1697
01:10:47,679 --> 01:10:50,399
kind of started

1698
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:53,039
think a little bit of how this actually

1699
01:10:50,399 --> 01:10:55,679
makes sense. And one of the things that

1700
01:10:53,039 --> 01:10:58,079
we did is that we actually looked into

1701
01:10:55,679 --> 01:10:59,760
other plant tissues than you would

1702
01:10:58,079 --> 01:11:02,079
normally do. So most people probably

1703
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:04,800
know of course we're all aware that

1704
01:11:02,079 --> 01:11:08,279
cannabonoids are formed in tricoms of of

1705
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:11,199
the flowers. Um there's also tricoms on

1706
01:11:08,279 --> 01:11:13,119
leaves and they do produce some

1707
01:11:11,198 --> 01:11:15,039
cannabonoids. Also the profile is a

1708
01:11:13,119 --> 01:11:17,079
little bit different than in the flowers

1709
01:11:15,039 --> 01:11:20,000
but there is and the levels are much

1710
01:11:17,079 --> 01:11:22,000
lower. But we basically systematically a

1711
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:24,719
little bit more systematically looked

1712
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:27,479
into different plant tissues

1713
01:11:24,719 --> 01:11:30,158
u in hemp plants as to if there would be

1714
01:11:27,479 --> 01:11:32,799
producing cannabonoids. And long story

1715
01:11:30,158 --> 01:11:35,039
short yes there are cannabonoids and

1716
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:37,440
other plant tissues. It's not just

1717
01:11:35,039 --> 01:11:41,198
flowers and leaves.

1718
01:11:37,439 --> 01:11:45,198
And knowing that now it starts making

1719
01:11:41,198 --> 01:11:47,839
much more sense. Uh so we also found

1720
01:11:45,198 --> 01:11:49,599
some cannabonoids and roots. Yeah. And

1721
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:52,079
that's a little bit the back background

1722
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:54,000
of that. So now we're that maybe the

1723
01:11:52,079 --> 01:11:57,679
cannabonoids and the roots also have an

1724
01:11:54,000 --> 01:12:00,960
effect on on inter biotic interactions

1725
01:11:57,679 --> 01:12:02,960
in the roots. So we can't yet confirm

1726
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:04,640
that finally, but I mean everything that

1727
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:06,760
we have points a little bit in this

1728
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:09,280
direction.

1729
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:12,480
Um, and so that's why we're following up

1730
01:12:09,279 --> 01:12:12,479
on that. And and in

1731
01:12:12,679 --> 01:12:18,319
particular, it seems to be not the usual

1732
01:12:16,319 --> 01:12:19,840
major cannabonoids that play a role in

1733
01:12:18,319 --> 01:12:21,679
these things, but it's rather some of

1734
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:23,039
the minor cannabonoids that play a role

1735
01:12:21,679 --> 01:12:27,039
there.

1736
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:29,119
So it so what what could be is that some

1737
01:12:27,039 --> 01:12:31,880
of the major cannabonoids are actually

1738
01:12:29,119 --> 01:12:34,960
there either due to human

1739
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:36,800
cultivation or more for interaction with

1740
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:39,198
mammals and that some of these minor

1741
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:43,079
cannabonoids are actually there are for

1742
01:12:39,198 --> 01:12:45,279
interaction with insects and other

1743
01:12:43,079 --> 01:12:47,840
non-malian herbivores if you want to

1744
01:12:45,279 --> 01:12:49,759
phrase it that way and then if you

1745
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:52,000
consider that it would makes perfect

1746
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:55,679
sense if some of these compounds are

1747
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:58,319
being produced in other tissues that of

1748
01:12:55,679 --> 01:13:01,679
course are being exposed to herbivy

1749
01:12:58,319 --> 01:13:03,960
similar to leaves or flowers. Yeah. So

1750
01:13:01,679 --> 01:13:06,800
that's a little bit where we are right

1751
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:08,158
now. And so yeah, I can't wait to see

1752
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:10,960
what your results are on that. That's

1753
01:13:08,158 --> 01:13:12,879
really fascinating. Um yeah, that's

1754
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:14,560
that's amazing. I had not something that

1755
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:17,520
was even on my radar in terms of

1756
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:20,640
thinking of like root herbivy from the

1757
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:22,640
perspective of well I mean one one other

1758
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:24,320
thing that is becoming clear now and

1759
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:26,480
that was kind of one of the big

1760
01:13:24,319 --> 01:13:30,000
questions on the science side of things

1761
01:13:26,479 --> 01:13:30,000
is a little bit

1762
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:37,119
um why are we aware of cannabonoids just

1763
01:13:35,198 --> 01:13:40,079
in the context of hemp and cannabis

1764
01:13:37,119 --> 01:13:43,198
plants and or are they indeed the only

1765
01:13:40,079 --> 01:13:44,800
plant producing cannibal oids. Um, and

1766
01:13:43,198 --> 01:13:47,119
that has a little bit to do with the

1767
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:48,800
biochemistry of things because the the

1768
01:13:47,119 --> 01:13:51,279
building blocks that you need to make a

1769
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:53,679
cannabonoid compound are actually

1770
01:13:51,279 --> 01:13:56,960
present in principle in any other plant

1771
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:59,679
as well. And so is for us on the the

1772
01:13:56,960 --> 01:14:01,960
biochemistry side, it was a little bit

1773
01:13:59,679 --> 01:14:04,960
of a puzzle

1774
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:06,719
to accept the fact that cannabonoids

1775
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:09,920
would be really just produced in in

1776
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:11,399
cannabis plants and not anywhere else.

1777
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:14,480
uh

1778
01:14:11,399 --> 01:14:17,439
and actually in the last couple years

1779
01:14:14,479 --> 01:14:21,119
literally last three four years there

1780
01:14:17,439 --> 01:14:23,439
have been a few publications now from

1781
01:14:21,119 --> 01:14:26,000
other plants where cannabonoids are

1782
01:14:23,439 --> 01:14:29,119
being found. So it seems to be not just

1783
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:31,359
cannabis but other plants as well and

1784
01:14:29,119 --> 01:14:33,840
fungi. Correct.

1785
01:14:31,359 --> 01:14:35,839
Yes. There there is there are some other

1786
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:37,600
organisms that can do it but in in

1787
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:39,440
plants there are some other plants and

1788
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:40,640
they're not related to cannabis. That's

1789
01:14:39,439 --> 01:14:42,799
the other thing that's kind of

1790
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:44,960
interesting. So, and that's kind of one

1791
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:46,039
of the was one of the one of the

1792
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:49,119
questions out

1793
01:14:46,039 --> 01:14:50,800
there that we were also kind of I we're

1794
01:14:49,119 --> 01:14:52,719
not working on this currently, but of

1795
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:54,719
course we're following this this

1796
01:14:52,719 --> 01:14:57,119
literature and and and this this area

1797
01:14:54,719 --> 01:14:59,520
quite interest in particular with

1798
01:14:57,119 --> 01:15:02,479
knowing what we found with respect to

1799
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:06,080
herbivy where we're like wondering well

1800
01:15:02,479 --> 01:15:07,919
if that's if that's if if you can

1801
01:15:06,079 --> 01:15:09,439
produce it in other plants as well then

1802
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:10,880
then it might become much more

1803
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:12,799
interesting.

1804
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:14,319
So what we actually and I think I

1805
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:16,480
mentioned that in our last meeting

1806
01:15:14,319 --> 01:15:19,519
already a little bit that we haven't re

1807
01:15:16,479 --> 01:15:21,198
recently submitted uh a provisional

1808
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:23,760
patent on some of these minor

1809
01:15:21,198 --> 01:15:27,198
cannibonoids due to their insecticidal

1810
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:30,480
activity that we discovered. Um because

1811
01:15:27,198 --> 01:15:34,479
we think that if if if if they really

1812
01:15:30,479 --> 01:15:36,479
have this activity as we've we've found,

1813
01:15:34,479 --> 01:15:39,439
this could be something where we could

1814
01:15:36,479 --> 01:15:42,158
actually use some of those as an organic

1815
01:15:39,439 --> 01:15:45,119
insecticide basically. And you could

1816
01:15:42,158 --> 01:15:47,039
also go down the road and basically not

1817
01:15:45,119 --> 01:15:49,840
breed because of course it's you can't

1818
01:15:47,039 --> 01:15:51,920
breed if it's not a cannabis plant, but

1819
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:54,880
you could genetically engineer it in

1820
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:57,279
other plants and and and basically by by

1821
01:15:54,880 --> 01:16:00,640
that protect other plants um through

1822
01:15:57,279 --> 01:16:02,599
cannabonoid formation.

1823
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:06,719
So you're saying that

1824
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:10,159
if if cannabonoids truly are response to

1825
01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:12,560
a rivery and may offer some sort of in

1826
01:16:10,158 --> 01:16:14,719
insect protection

1827
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:17,120
um you would expect to find it in other

1828
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:18,480
plants too because other plants would

1829
01:16:17,119 --> 01:16:20,000
have evolved to have this. And now

1830
01:16:18,479 --> 01:16:22,000
you're saying that in recent years we've

1831
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:25,119
discovered that it does exist in other

1832
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:27,600
plants. And so there there's just

1833
01:16:25,119 --> 01:16:29,198
stronger evidence that that the the

1834
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:31,600
possibility these minor canabonoids

1835
01:16:29,198 --> 01:16:34,479
cannabonoids may play a role in plant

1836
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:36,679
defense and that down the road we may be

1837
01:16:34,479 --> 01:16:39,519
able to

1838
01:16:36,679 --> 01:16:41,840
man manipulate that or understand

1839
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:44,159
utilize it. Thank you. That's the word I

1840
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:45,600
was looking for. Okay. All right. Last

1841
01:16:44,158 --> 01:16:47,479
question though because we've already

1842
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:49,920
gone over our time.

1843
01:16:47,479 --> 01:16:52,759
Um, you mentioned this and I hadn't

1844
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:56,399
heard this that you can use tarpen as a

1845
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:58,800
bofuel additive in this article. Can you

1846
01:16:56,399 --> 01:17:00,000
just in a minute or two just touch on

1847
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:03,159
that because I found that real

1848
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:05,520
fascinating. I had never heard this.

1849
01:17:03,158 --> 01:17:07,960
Okay. Yeah, that that's that's a

1850
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:11,280
completely different avenue. So,

1851
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:13,520
totally. Yeah, there there is quite a

1852
01:17:11,279 --> 01:17:16,800
bit of interest in tarpen as sort of a

1853
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:21,280
fuel um either as an additive or even as

1854
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:24,920
a as a pure fuel by itself. Um the the

1855
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:27,599
simple logic behind it is is turppines

1856
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:30,000
are volatile compound. They're scent

1857
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:33,440
compounds. So they they from their

1858
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:36,000
physical physicochemical properties go

1859
01:17:33,439 --> 01:17:38,960
into the emit into the atmosphere at

1860
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:41,198
relatively low temperatures. Yeah. So,

1861
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:43,119
so barely at at ambient room

1862
01:17:41,198 --> 01:17:45,519
temperatures they they're they're

1863
01:17:43,119 --> 01:17:47,599
emitted into the into the gas phase and

1864
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:51,280
and that's why plants are using them as

1865
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:53,679
a way of communicating basically. Yeah.

1866
01:17:51,279 --> 01:17:55,679
But that's a property that you want to

1867
01:17:53,679 --> 01:18:00,560
have for fuel as well. So, one of the

1868
01:17:55,679 --> 01:18:02,640
problems with bofuels is that I mean if

1869
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:04,239
you take your your canola oil as a

1870
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:06,239
biodiesel

1871
01:18:04,238 --> 01:18:09,359
um if you put that in the tank of your

1872
01:18:06,238 --> 01:18:13,479
car and in winter the temperatures are

1873
01:18:09,359 --> 01:18:16,559
low um your your oil starts

1874
01:18:13,479 --> 01:18:19,439
solidifying basically your vegetable oil

1875
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:21,920
turns into magarine. Yeah. And of course

1876
01:18:19,439 --> 01:18:23,519
you can't drive on that. Yeah. Uh that's

1877
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:26,880
a problem because it's not liquid

1878
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:28,719
anymore. uh and the same problem you're

1879
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:30,199
also facing if you think about

1880
01:18:28,719 --> 01:18:33,359
sustainable

1881
01:18:30,198 --> 01:18:36,198
sustainable aviation fuels. So when

1882
01:18:33,359 --> 01:18:41,479
you're flying a plane at 30

1883
01:18:36,198 --> 01:18:45,119
35,000 feet altitude, it's -60° out

1884
01:18:41,479 --> 01:18:47,599
there. And of course any fuel that have

1885
01:18:45,119 --> 01:18:49,920
you have in your tank of your plane also

1886
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:52,159
needs to stay liquid because otherwise

1887
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:54,399
you can't fly on it anymore. And so that

1888
01:18:52,158 --> 01:18:55,920
that's with kerosene that's the case.

1889
01:18:54,399 --> 01:18:57,679
And so that's the same thing when you

1890
01:18:55,920 --> 01:19:00,399
want to have replace kerosene with

1891
01:18:57,679 --> 01:19:03,279
something more sustainable. You have to

1892
01:19:00,399 --> 01:19:05,279
make sure that whatever fuel you're

1893
01:19:03,279 --> 01:19:09,479
using it stays liquid at low

1894
01:19:05,279 --> 01:19:12,399
temperatures. Yeah. And

1895
01:19:09,479 --> 01:19:14,718
tarpines check mark that box. Basically

1896
01:19:12,399 --> 01:19:16,158
you can really chill them down to quite

1897
01:19:14,719 --> 01:19:18,600
low temperatures and they're still

1898
01:19:16,158 --> 01:19:21,759
liquid. And so either by using them

1899
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:24,000
purely or by mixing them in and by that

1900
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:26,320
basically also lowering the temp the the

1901
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:30,158
the solidification. So basically the

1902
01:19:26,319 --> 01:19:32,319
temperature by which a a a fuel solid.

1903
01:19:30,158 --> 01:19:35,519
Yeah. The freezing or melting point.

1904
01:19:32,319 --> 01:19:37,840
Yeah. Yeah. Um so basically you can do a

1905
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:39,840
mixture or a pure. So there are actually

1906
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:42,640
this and this is actually being done

1907
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:45,199
already. So even the the the the the US

1908
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:49,840
military, the air force has already done

1909
01:19:45,198 --> 01:19:51,678
and flown planes on turppines. So

1910
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:53,760
they're using it as as as an aviation

1911
01:19:51,679 --> 01:19:55,600
fuel already. I mean, of course, this is

1912
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:58,000
experimental. This is not a final

1913
01:19:55,600 --> 01:20:01,679
applied state, but it is definitely an

1914
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:05,198
idea that is is more than just the the

1915
01:20:01,679 --> 01:20:07,440
brainchild of some some weird scientist.

1916
01:20:05,198 --> 01:20:10,319
Um so this is this is really has some

1917
01:20:07,439 --> 01:20:12,158
some real world applications already.

1918
01:20:10,319 --> 01:20:14,559
And basically the idea is like you know

1919
01:20:12,158 --> 01:20:18,960
I mean we can drive our cars with

1920
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:22,560
electricity now. Um we can replace fuel

1921
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:25,198
consumptions with bally uh electricity

1922
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:28,159
and hopefully you get that from

1923
01:20:25,198 --> 01:20:30,238
renewable sources but you can't fly a

1924
01:20:28,158 --> 01:20:32,960
plane on electricity at least not for

1925
01:20:30,238 --> 01:20:34,439
very far. I mean short distances you can

1926
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:37,840
do but

1927
01:20:34,439 --> 01:20:39,439
international aviation doesn't work with

1928
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:42,079
electricity. Yeah. that that that that

1929
01:20:39,439 --> 01:20:45,439
that it's just not doable. And so for

1930
01:20:42,079 --> 01:20:47,679
certain purposes, you still need a fuel,

1931
01:20:45,439 --> 01:20:49,279
a chemical. Uh and if you want to do

1932
01:20:47,679 --> 01:20:50,640
that a little bit more sustainable, then

1933
01:20:49,279 --> 01:20:52,559
you have to come up with ideas. And

1934
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:55,920
turppins are one of those things that's

1935
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:58,719
out there sort of in the uh in the in in

1936
01:20:55,920 --> 01:21:00,480
in in the portfolio of ideas that are

1937
01:20:58,719 --> 01:21:02,119
currently being considered and tested

1938
01:21:00,479 --> 01:21:06,119
out.

1939
01:21:02,119 --> 01:21:08,679
And I mean bringing it back to hemp, I

1940
01:21:06,119 --> 01:21:11,039
mean they're producing a lot of

1941
01:21:08,679 --> 01:21:13,359
turppines and so it could be in the long

1942
01:21:11,039 --> 01:21:15,439
run an interesting crop where you could

1943
01:21:13,359 --> 01:21:17,519
potentially produce turppines that then

1944
01:21:15,439 --> 01:21:19,919
you could use as a as a fuel additive

1945
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:22,080
there later on. So that's this is one of

1946
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:25,119
the other ideas or or or reasons why

1947
01:21:22,079 --> 01:21:27,039
we're interested in metabolism of hemp

1948
01:21:25,119 --> 01:21:28,719
and cannabis because there could be

1949
01:21:27,039 --> 01:21:31,679
completely different applications than

1950
01:21:28,719 --> 01:21:33,840
what we're thinking about right now.

1951
01:21:31,679 --> 01:21:35,359
And that could be one of those. I'm not

1952
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:38,000
saying that that we're going down that

1953
01:21:35,359 --> 01:21:39,679
road at some point. Yeah, I just hadn't

1954
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:41,439
heard that. It's fascinating and I just

1955
01:21:39,679 --> 01:21:43,679
