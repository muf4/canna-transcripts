00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:29,038
where we discuss The Cutting Edge of

6
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,880
growing from a science-based perspective

7
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,600
and drawn top experts from around the

8
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:35,479
industry to share their wisdom and

13
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,079
governing defense and secondary

14
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,879
metabolism in Plants Dr Zer spent a

15
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:50,719
decade as a research associate at the

16
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:53,320
University of G where his research

17
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:55,399
focused on stress physiology and plants

18
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,679
his primary passion lies in the study of

19
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:59,320
plant secondary metabolites many of

20
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:00,840
which possess pharmaceutical

21
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,439
significance

22
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,280

for joining us on the podcast

57
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:22,920
today thank you very much Tad for having

58
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:25,119
me yeah I was so excited to meet you in

59
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:28,280
uh Melbourne Australia at the at the

60
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:31,280
farm out conference uh because you have

61
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:33,759
such a wonderful research background in

62
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,318
tissue culture and micropropagation can

63
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:38,878
you talk a little bit about about that

64
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:40,560
background and what your uh area of

65
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:45,239
expertise

66
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:48,959
is uh absolutely um well uh I earned my

67
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:53,560
PhD degree uh from uh Leiden University

68
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:56,959
back to 2002 uh in Netherland and during

69
00:02:53,560 --> 00:03:00,759
my PhD program I really study the

70
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:04,280
molecular mechanism of Defense how plant

71
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:07,399
can defense itself against the adverse

72
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:10,719
environment it was a fascinating uh

73
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:13,560
experience how what what genes involve

74
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:16,199
and what the product uh plan make to

75
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:21,439
battle and cope the adverse

76
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:24,919
environment uh in 2007 I moved to Canada

77
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:28,438
and at the University of GF and I study

78
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:30,280
uh secondary metabolite pathway uh maybe

79
00:03:28,438 --> 00:03:33,719
it's worse that I explain what is the

80
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:37,039
secondary metabolites a plant as a

81
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:40,318
autotrophic organism making primary

82
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:42,959
metabol metabolites and secondary

83
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:44,280
metabolites primary metabolites like a

84
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,239
protein

85
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:50,360
carbohydrate and fatty acids they are

86
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:53,480
just they are they make it for growth

87
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:57,439
and development but secondary metabolite

88
00:03:53,479 --> 00:04:01,280
is the bunch of molecules plant make it

89
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:03,519
just to uh to prepare its against uh

90
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:07,280
biotic and abiotic

91
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:09,920
stresses uh so I was very interested to

92
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,799
learn more about the paway and actually

93
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:15,878
it turns also out the cannabinoids is

94
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:19,519
one of the secondary metabolites was is

95
00:04:15,878 --> 00:04:22,279
was made and is made in in cannabis uh

96
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:25,000
those those molecules not plant doesn't

97
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:27,599
make it just for fun they are making it

98
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,839
to just get them ready against her

99
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,919
beavers different pests and pathogens

100
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:38,038
and also abiotic uh

101
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:41,319
stresses uh it was a again a very

102
00:04:38,038 --> 00:04:45,439
exceptional experience for me uh but

103
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:49,879
once uh about the 2017 when legalization

104
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:52,478
happened in Canada I was uh I was

105
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:54,000
following the news and movement through

106
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:57,758
toward to the

107
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,918
legalization and also study the science

108
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:04,080
of cannabis um I found that there's not

109
00:05:00,918 --> 00:05:06,399
much science is behind cannabis was the

110
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:10,038
reason was uh I think now is very

111
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:12,120
obvious because Cannabis used used to be

112
00:05:10,038 --> 00:05:14,000
uh control substances therefore there

113
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:17,759
was no

114
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,319
much uh research group had access to

115
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:23,600
cannabis plan to do the research this

116
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:27,000
has prompted me um to write a few grants

117
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:30,720
and get the uh fund from government of

118
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,720
Canada and I started tissue culture

119
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:36,840
research and as a result of those tissue

120
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:40,280
culture research uh research uh three uh

121
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:42,318
peer review journal uh paper came and

122
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:46,399
published in the three different

123
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:48,680
journals uh and we learn a lot about how

124
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:51,638
we can do the tissue culture and how

125
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:57,120
tissue culture can serve the new

126
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:59,759
industry um also um I because now after

127
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:03,478
this those years of experience I was

128
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:07,360
also able to uh establish a company can

129
00:06:03,478 --> 00:06:10,560
know and serve a a different license

130
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,800
holder to establish and Design Lab and

131
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,000
also equip them with the different

132
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:19,840
equipment necessary for tissue culture

133
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,560
and and also train their staff member uh

134
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:25,959
at this point now currently I'm actually

135
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:29,120
in Queensland Australia and I'm working

136
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:32,120
with the Pharma crop and new license

137
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:35,439
holder for cannabis cultivation and

138
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:39,759
processing um I'm actually holding

139
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:43,439
position of the chief uh operating um

140
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:46,439
officer to make sure uh from the sea to

141
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:48,839
say we incorporate science and we bring

142
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:52,598
the new techniques for the for the

143
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:56,679
quality product for the medical uh

144
00:06:52,598 --> 00:07:00,159
Market uh it was a long adventure uh

145
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:04,038
career Adventure but it's just all steps

146
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:06,039
was very valuable for me and was very

147
00:07:04,038 --> 00:07:08,478
exciting yeah we talked about how you

148
00:07:06,038 --> 00:07:11,279
and your family have have had to uproot

149
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:13,478
and travel quite a bit on this academic

150
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:16,959
uh Journey you've been on uh over the

151
00:07:13,478 --> 00:07:20,399
last decade or so so that's yeah that's

152
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:23,318
really commendable um just to touch on

153
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:26,318
really quickly there are three papers

154
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:27,840
that you've written that um that have

155
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,800
been peer- reviewed and published in

156
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:31,638
journals the one is called called

157
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,439
cannabis synthetic seeds an alternative

158
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:36,439
approach for commercial scale of clonal

159
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:39,240
propagation and germ plasm conservation

160
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:40,879
uh another in 2022 as well that was

161
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,840
published called Improvement of mineral

162
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:45,120
nutrition and rooting efficiency of

163
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:46,638
Cannabis sativa for inv vitro large

164
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,959
scale prop

165
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:53,240
propagation uh and then the third that

166
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:55,799
is U Cannabis sativa Cannabis sativa

167
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:58,038
photo autotrophic micropropagation a

168
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,280
powerful tool for industrial scale inv

169
00:07:58,038 --> 00:08:02,279
vitro propagation wow those are all

170
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:05,478
mouthfuls of titles

171
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:08,119
so I got to read those papers uh and I

172
00:08:05,478 --> 00:08:11,878
learned a lot um I think it's really

173
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:14,478
interesting uh can we go ahead and talk

174
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:16,400
can can we go back to the very beginning

175
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:18,918
of this process though for people and

176
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:22,359
just talk a little bit about what is

177
00:08:18,918 --> 00:08:26,038
tissue culture uh in

178
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:28,479
general uh yes of course uh plant tissue

179
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:29,959
uh culture is a technique of growing

180
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:33,199
plant cell

181
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:36,759
tissue or organ in an artificial and

182
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:40,000
Estero environment where you put the

183
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:43,399
piece of the plant tissue on a on a in

184
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:47,919
reach medium and let them grow and

185
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:50,759
usually uh the we we are able uh to uh

186
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:53,639
first induce some shoots from this

187
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:55,759
xplant the piece of the uh tissue we are

188
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:59,439
putting on a medium we call it xpl

189
00:08:55,759 --> 00:09:02,639
so-called xplant so we will able to use

190
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,959
usually yes xplant and we usually are

191
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:07,838
able to grow them in the shoot form

192
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:09,958
first and then we can dissect them and

193
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:13,240
then we can also put in the separate

194
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:15,919
medium to induce rooting and eventually

195
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:20,039
the whole Minature form of the plant

196
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:22,759
will be created in the in the Estero jar

197
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:26,240
and in the Estero environment that's

198
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:28,958
basically the uh the meaning of tissue

199
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:33,079
culture this xplant can be taken from

200
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:37,919
pet can be taken from leaves and even

201
00:09:33,078 --> 00:09:41,159
flower or other part or segment like a a

202
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:44,719
segment of a stem including bods in

203
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:48,559
cannabis very routine uh form which is a

204
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:52,920
much easier form is just the taking half

205
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:56,439
5 mm to 6 mm of the segment of the choot

206
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:58,919
which carries one single B so basically

207
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:01,880
when you are inserting to the medium

208
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:04,159
after of course after sterilization uh

209
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:07,200
they they proliferate and make a three

210
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:09,439
to four shoots and then you can dissect

211
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,720
it so that because you can dissect it

212
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,399
you can imagine it's happening in two to

213
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:16,839
three weeks so you can imagine every

214
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,399
period of two three weeks you can from

215
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:21,480
one single node you can make a four

216
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:24,639
branch and after four Branch after

217
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:27,360
following uh period at second cycle you

218
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:30,078
can get from four you can get 16 and so

219
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,879
on and so forth this is the this is the

220
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:33,958
call of meaning of

221
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:36,278
micropropagation which is a section

222
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:39,518
under tissue

223
00:10:36,278 --> 00:10:42,078
culture I think I understand so tissue

224
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:44,399
culture which is a common practice in

225
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:47,239
the horiculture industry already I know

226
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:49,399
we use tissue culture with numerous

227
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,639
plants uh though cannabis seems to be a

228
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:52,879
little bit more challenging and a little

229
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:55,600
bit unique and I want to dive into that

230
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:58,278
but uh this idea of tissue culture is um

231
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,159
taking a small amount of plant material

232
00:10:58,278 --> 00:11:01,399
and then um

233
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:04,799
extracting it from the plant and then

234
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:08,360
essentially in in a test tube more or

235
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:12,519
less or you know cultural media uh

236
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:15,759
growing out this plant um again from

237
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:17,839
just a tiny amount of of of tissue and

238
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:19,919
so micropropagation if I understand

239
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,639
correctly then is this process it's an

240
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:23,278
exponential process that allows you to

241
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:25,560
create a whole bunch of these little

242
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:28,320
tiny plants that could then be put into

243
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:30,559
production in a commercial facility or

244
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,480
commercial environment uh down the road

245
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:36,719
and that's one of the benefits of tissue

246
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:40,079
culture but maybe not the main benefit

247
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:43,519
right exactly exactly

248
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:46,479
so micro tissue culture as you said it

249
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:49,039
has history of the decad so it it

250
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:52,839
started massively from the even 60 and

251
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:55,159
70 from different species some species

252
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:57,839
was in danger scientists found its

253
00:11:55,159 --> 00:12:00,278
formulation for medium to conserve them

254
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:03,800
in the in the init condition in the

255
00:12:00,278 --> 00:12:06,639
vessel jars to just save them and this

256
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:09,759
has been over decades many species

257
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:12,639
formulation uh has been developed for

258
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:17,480
cannabis uh back to

259
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:20,159
2017 once uh once we we had access to 50

260
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:23,879
different strains uh and we were quite

261
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:26,319
excited to finish a lab and and put them

262
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:31,120
on the tissue culture medium based on

263
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:34,600
the available uh formul was published

264
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:38,720
and very soon we found out oh most of

265
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:42,079
those strain do not grow they show uh

266
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:46,399
they show stunted some of them they show

267
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:51,039
degree of malformation they show also uh

268
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:53,480
translucent uh uh leaves we call it very

269
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:56,480
dark dark green with the very

270
00:12:53,480 --> 00:13:00,560
translucent appearance uh we call it

271
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,560
which is a sort of Mal Mal formality we

272
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:04,879
call it

273
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:07,000
hyperhydricity so that was we we were

274
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:09,198
actually we were quite surprised so

275
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,958
majority of them they are not growing

276
00:13:09,198 --> 00:13:13,439
they are just surviv and some of them

277
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:18,039
they die out in the tissue culture this

278
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:22,680
has prompted me to develop a mimic of

279
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:26,480
conventional propagation for inside the

280
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:29,278
aseptic conditions my first paper is uh

281
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:32,240
is you mentioned about the uh

282
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:35,120
autotrophic they call it autotrophic

283
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:38,959
micropropagation so we just mimic the

284
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:41,159
conventional method we know as you uh

285
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:43,479
conventional method for commercial

286
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:46,278
propagation of cannabis is through the

287
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:49,399
cutting right so piece of Branch will be

288
00:13:46,278 --> 00:13:53,399
taken with the piece of also attached uh

289
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:56,399
leaves we if we put them in the uh gy

290
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:59,159
pot or in the Rock full in the humid

291
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:01,839
condition for for two to three weeks

292
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:05,039
they get rooted sounds very easy very

293
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:09,440
very cheap this is absolutely correct

294
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:12,958
once we have the healthy mother plant

295
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:16,240
but mother plant is often get sick once

296
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:18,399
the plant gets sick and diseased then

297
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:21,519
first of all the it interfere the

298
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:24,039
rooting process secondly even your

299
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:26,919
rooting is successful you get the rooted

300
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:30,679
plant when you put in the production it

301
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:32,519
has a significant impact on yield and

302
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:35,638
quality of the medicinal

303
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:37,600
cannabis so that's that's a message to

304
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:40,320
me saying that conventional methods

305
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,920
should work but this is needs a healthy

306
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:47,000
plan and this is the tissue culture

307
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:48,799
comes in saying that tissue culture can

308
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,639
uh we can use the benefit of tissue

309
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:55,319
culture to clean the plant make a

310
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:57,720
healthy plant and offer to the new

311
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:59,440
industry so this is really the biggest

312
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:05,079
benefit of tissue culture is is the

313
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:06,600
opportunity to get a clean plant um and

314
00:15:05,078 --> 00:15:08,679
and this and that's one of the

315
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,399
challenges with clonal prop propagation

316
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:12,838
which is the most common form of

317
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,720
propagation right now with cannabis

318
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:16,880
because it is so easy you get a a

319
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,680
genetically identical plant to your

320
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:20,759
original plant um and you get the same

321
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:24,198
with tissue culture you get a

322
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:25,919
genetically identical plant as well um

323
00:15:24,198 --> 00:15:27,639
which I think is important though you

324
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:29,519
use the word aseptic which is another

325
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:31,639
word for sterile for those familiar so

326
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,440
this whole process with tissue culture

327
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:35,000
requires a sterile environment and

328
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:38,600
that's a real challenge for a lot of

329
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,159
labs and Growers um which is I think one

330
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:42,319
of the reasons we don't see tissue

331
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:44,799
culture popping up as

332
00:15:42,318 --> 00:15:48,278
successfully uh in cannabis operations

333
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:50,318
as uh you may you may think so so the

334
00:15:48,278 --> 00:15:52,159
challenge with tissue culture as I

335
00:15:50,318 --> 00:15:56,278
understand it is you need sterile

336
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:59,360
conditions you need um you need the

337
00:15:56,278 --> 00:16:01,480
right media

338
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:04,278
the growth media that you're putting the

339
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:06,240
plant into and then you need to properly

340
00:16:04,278 --> 00:16:08,958
maintain and care for that plant in

341
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,959
order to get through the tissue culture

342
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:13,679
process to where you have a stable plant

343
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:16,119
that you can put back out into the into

344
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:18,599
your growing environment is that

345
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:20,879
absolutely is that correct y yeah it's

346
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:24,120
correct just wanted to add exactly so

347
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:27,399
one of the main goal uh for the tissue

348
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:30,198
culture can be providing healthy plant

349
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:33,559
this healthy plant is not not only uh

350
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:36,639
can be pest free can be pathogen free

351
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:40,119
and also including a virus and virid

352
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:42,318
which is now these days is Hot Topic I I

353
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:44,919
listened to one of your episode previous

354
00:16:42,318 --> 00:16:47,479
episode regarding H plat and virate

355
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:50,198
which is a devastating pathogen for for

356
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:52,639
the Cannabis industry so with the

357
00:16:50,198 --> 00:16:55,519
Cannabis also we with the with the

358
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:59,519
tissue culture we are able using marem

359
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:03,039
culture techniques H get the plant uh

360
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:06,078
again this te this techniques I have I

361
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:09,399
have done it for two rounds so far and

362
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:13,240
this is a uh regenerate healthy plan but

363
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:17,000
takes up 9 to 10 months this is not very

364
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:19,318
quick and uh an easy process but it can

365
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,880
be done the other things also I wanted

366
00:17:19,318 --> 00:17:26,038
to add it with what you said is the

367
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:28,919
conservation um we I'm sure you have

368
00:17:26,038 --> 00:17:31,640
visited many licensed producer they are

369
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:34,038
very proud of this strain they have they

370
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:36,000
are sometimes they are 50 and sometimes

371
00:17:34,038 --> 00:17:38,879
they are few hundreds strain they don't

372
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,720
want to lose them uh they consider it as

373
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:45,080
a asset of the company each of those

374
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:48,319
different strain carries a specific Pro

375
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:50,558
profile of terpin specific and also High

376
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:52,639
potency or low potency or different

377
00:17:50,558 --> 00:17:55,079
ratio of cannabinoids they don't want it

378
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,919
to lose them they wanted to have them in

379
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:59,759
a case they wanted to put them in for

380
00:17:56,919 --> 00:18:02,038
the production but this maintenance of

381
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:05,599
mother plant of different strain in the

382
00:18:02,038 --> 00:18:08,200
form of mother plants it's very costly

383
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:12,119
it's a sometimes they occupied mother

384
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:16,720
plant occupied up to 20 to 30% of the

385
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:20,879
total uh cultivation space uh cannabis

386
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:24,480
also can offer also conservation meaning

387
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:27,360
just that we need a few piece of stem of

388
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,919
those mod plants put them through the

389
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:32,479
sterilization

390
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:35,799
using sanitizer usually is it just a 10

391
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:39,279
times dilution of bleach works perfectly

392
00:18:35,798 --> 00:18:43,200
and then we put in the medium and let

393
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:46,519
them just stay there and slightly grow

394
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:50,600
and you can have in the one square meter

395
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:54,679
of shelf you can probably holding 30 to

396
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:57,678
50 different strains it's very simple so

397
00:18:54,679 --> 00:18:59,600
enormously save cost for the license

398
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,798
holder instead of the having mother

399
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:04,678
plant which also vulnerable for the

400
00:19:01,798 --> 00:19:07,839
disease and past put them in the in the

401
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:11,400
invitro condition in the Ester condition

402
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:14,959
and keep them there to my experience I

403
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:18,559
again back to your genetic Fidelity and

404
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:22,200
uh to my experience I kept few of those

405
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:25,359
experience up to three years and once we

406
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:28,840
took them back and acclimate them and we

407
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:32,279
put them to the grow grow they were the

408
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:35,079
same as mother plan four years ago they

409
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:38,480
there was a no we did not yeah we did

410
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:40,558
not receive any genetic drift over three

411
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:43,200
years it to my

412
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:45,279
experience so you said 30 just to

413
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:50,798
highlight you said 30 to 50 plants in

414
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:54,359
one square meter of space so yeah yeah

415
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:56,879
essentially a shelf on a on a yeah on a

416
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:59,439
rack uh and you're I remember seeing a

417
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,960
photo of this you showed the what light

418
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:05,558
levels were using it was quite low

419
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:08,720
correct exactly can tissue culture in

420
00:20:05,558 --> 00:20:10,960
general doesn't need high level of light

421
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,679
because there's a not much evaporation

422
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,558
is happening there's a not much

423
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:18,440
transpiration is happening therefore

424
00:20:15,558 --> 00:20:21,319
light of the 100 micro moles per square

425
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:24,279
meter per second is the usually is

426
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:27,879
optimal but also species to species can

427
00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:32,158
be varies we already tested for cannabis

428
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:35,360
between 100 220 is a optimal range for

429
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:37,320
cannabis micropropagation and tissue

430
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:39,719
culture that's wonderful so you're

431
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:41,519
saving a ton of electricity as well over

432
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:43,319
the course of those you know essentially

433
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:45,599
three years of keeping those genetics

434
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:48,079
preserved with with minimal light I mean

435
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:50,480
that's a that's a shop light more or

436
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:54,759
less what we would call here just an LED

437
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:58,279
a cheap LED bulb would would give you um

438
00:20:54,759 --> 00:21:00,599
getting back though to your this idea

439
00:20:58,279 --> 00:21:03,480
that tissue culture meristematic tissue

440
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:06,519
culture cleans plants I wanted to

441
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:09,159
approach it from a different angle

442
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:10,918
so if we were talking about a plant

443
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:14,400
that's been in production a mother plant

444
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:16,799
now you've had for years and that and um

445
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,038
well oh I mean a plant genetics you've

446
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:20,359
had for years that maybe your mother

447
00:21:18,038 --> 00:21:23,079
plant has changed every cycle but you

448
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:26,439
seem to see some degradation in the

449
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:28,678
genetics um or at least the genetic

450
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:31,558
expression could you attribute this

451
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:33,120
maybe to a bacterial load or a viral

452
00:21:31,558 --> 00:21:34,960
load that may be building up in the

453
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:39,479
mother plant to where those genetics may

454
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:42,278
still be the same genetic

455
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:45,159
uh identical genetics to what you had

456
00:21:42,278 --> 00:21:46,919
four years ago but through the course of

457
00:21:45,159 --> 00:21:49,400
just plant stress and all these other

458
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:50,320
things it's it it's less likely to be I

459
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,080
guess what I'm questioning is it less

460
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:54,240
likely to be genetic drift through

461
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:56,240
clonal propagation than to be more of an

462
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:59,200
issue of pathogen

463
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:01,679
load yeah that's very B very nice

464
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:05,480
question t thank you for bringing this

465
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:08,960
up uh uh many we have been interacted

466
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:10,798
with the many uh many Growers they they

467
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,480
many times they told me I'm sure

468
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:15,839
probably you had the same experience uh

469
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:18,319
they said we had this this strain was

470
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:21,918
very nice and very had we get the very

471
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:25,519
good potency with the nice pering Terin

472
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:27,880
profile but not anymore now it's the the

473
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:30,440
the mother plan is declining the progeny

474
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:33,799
we are taking from mother plant is not

475
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:36,240
the same as before most

476
00:22:33,798 --> 00:22:38,720
likely case to case might be different

477
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:41,919
but most likely is just that because of

478
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:45,319
the pathogen load decline in the mother

479
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:47,720
plant and also transmitted from mother

480
00:22:45,319 --> 00:22:53,079
plant to the to the progeny and they

481
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:54,720
will be a stay with the in progeny so

482
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:58,119
that

483
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,720
Main and that's a main challenge so

484
00:22:58,119 --> 00:23:02,719
having

485
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:05,839
uh tissue culture techniques in place we

486
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:08,360
are able to clean up the uh the plant

487
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:10,359
and bring it back I had a multiple

488
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:14,678
client saying that our mother plant

489
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:17,079
getting sick so let's you send us few

490
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:19,278
healthy plant every six months then we

491
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:22,439
are guaranteed we are starting our

492
00:23:19,278 --> 00:23:25,558
starting material is clean so basically

493
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:27,919
again what we are learning here we uh

494
00:23:25,558 --> 00:23:30,440
probably in at least in the case of uh

495
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:33,480
cannabis micropropagation is not main

496
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:36,720
goal of tissue culture but cleaning

497
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:40,759
program uh would uh would be very nice

498
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,759
goal for tissue culture as well as

499
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:46,559
conservation that's that's great yeah I

500
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:49,840
so so we may be able to use tissue

501
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:52,240
culture as a way of um getting plants

502
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:55,558
refreshed back to where they were you

503
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:57,200
know say years ago because as a genetic

504
00:23:55,558 --> 00:24:01,240
I'm not a geneticist but from a genetic

505
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:04,240
perspective as I understand it uh stress

506
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:07,798
plants are more likely to experience

507
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:09,079
genetic mutation so um you know if

508
00:24:07,798 --> 00:24:11,679
you're

509
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:14,079
constantly cloning off of a plant that's

510
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:16,159
stressed you may get some genetic

511
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:18,839
mutation you you have more incidents of

512
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:21,880
genetic mutation more likely to occur

513
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:24,959
that being said what seems to be

514
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:26,760
happening uh in most cases is like what

515
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,919
you just suggested is this idea that

516
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:31,720
there is a pathogen load that it's

517
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:33,679
stressing the plants over time um and so

518
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,399
if we can remove that pathogen load we

519
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:38,320
may be able to get back to the original

520
00:24:35,398 --> 00:24:40,038
genetics that you know we originally had

521
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:41,678
and that we were so excited about does

522
00:24:40,038 --> 00:24:45,558
that sound like an

523
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:49,759
okay absolutely no it's a I agree with

524
00:24:45,558 --> 00:24:52,798
you this is a most like I I don't want

525
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:55,158
to rule out the possibility of genetic

526
00:24:52,798 --> 00:24:58,158
drifts it's could naturally is happening

527
00:24:55,159 --> 00:25:00,679
in the nature and including cannabis in

528
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:03,278
and at at the commercial scale but I

529
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:06,600
want to say most likely this this

530
00:25:03,278 --> 00:25:08,440
declining we are observing very often in

531
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:11,240
the in the in the different mother

532
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:13,960
plants and different cultivars they are

533
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:17,359
putting for production it comes from the

534
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:19,798
different pathogen get into them those

535
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:22,678
cannabis and cannabis are very

536
00:25:19,798 --> 00:25:25,398
vulnerable to many pathogen including

537
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:29,120
also virus and

538
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:31,519
virid so if I had a plan in a commercial

539
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:33,678
facility let's say my facility was

540
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:35,558
contaminated with hop plate and viroid

541
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:37,080
and we knew we had it in our plants

542
00:25:35,558 --> 00:25:40,000
we've tested for it we've gotten

543
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:41,359
positive results um so the process would

544
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:47,038
be to

545
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:49,278
send off samples or small tissue small

546
00:25:47,038 --> 00:25:53,000
amounts of tissue to a tissue culture

547
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:56,079
lab a a reputable tissue culture lab and

548
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:59,359
then start over with the plants that we

549
00:25:56,079 --> 00:26:02,278
get back and I assume then a a reputable

550
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:04,719
tissue culture lab would be able to grow

551
00:26:02,278 --> 00:26:07,679
those plants out and then after the

552
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:10,399
plants are established at a certain size

553
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:14,600
or you know robustness then they'd be

554
00:26:10,398 --> 00:26:16,439
able to test them for hop lat and vroid

555
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:18,759
or whatever pathogen we're trying to

556
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:21,679
remove and then at that point we could

557
00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:24,319
have a COA essentially stating that the

558
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:26,679
plant is is vroid free that could come

559
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:28,798
back into our facility and allow us to

560
00:26:26,679 --> 00:26:33,200
start over

561
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:37,119
that's exactly what we used to do it uh

562
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:40,840
uh few clients uh approach us saying

563
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:43,798
that we our our and the best Elite

564
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:45,918
cultiv was contaminated now we test is

565
00:26:43,798 --> 00:26:48,879
positive and we don't know what to do

566
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:53,200
and plant is declining what we ask is

567
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:55,559
just a few uh piece of cuttings um and

568
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:58,558
we as we put them through the

569
00:26:55,558 --> 00:27:02,240
sterilization we put them uh to the

570
00:26:58,558 --> 00:27:04,879
culture medium and and force the BS to

571
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:09,000
grow so this is very it's worth it to

572
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:13,278
mention that so meryem culture is is

573
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:16,119
just the exision of the top growing top

574
00:27:13,278 --> 00:27:19,440
of the shoot they call it epical

575
00:27:16,119 --> 00:27:22,719
meristem of shoot if you excise this

576
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:26,640
part and remove it and place it in the

577
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:29,798
medium you regenerate a whole plant from

578
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:32,679
the very tiny amount of tissue let's

579
00:27:29,798 --> 00:27:36,079
back because there is a reason growing

580
00:27:32,679 --> 00:27:39,919
point is the place the cell division is

581
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:44,359
happening it's very active and usually

582
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:47,519
virus and viroid located in xylm and flm

583
00:27:44,359 --> 00:27:51,558
but the tip of the shoot has not

584
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:55,159
developed zym and flm and is actively

585
00:27:51,558 --> 00:27:59,759
growing so it's like a growing point and

586
00:27:55,159 --> 00:28:02,480
the the W never reach to the point you

587
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:06,079
are excising the T and you are putting

588
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:09,240
to me putting the medium to hoping for

589
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:11,839
regeneration but also is uh I need I

590
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:14,798
need to also explain it usually we do

591
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:19,639
some treatment depends of the type of

592
00:28:14,798 --> 00:28:23,200
the vir to reduce the virus load and

593
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:25,559
then take the take the ex excise the te

594
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:28,240
and putting the medium after

595
00:28:25,558 --> 00:28:30,759
optimization and bringing the new

596
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:34,359
formulation for cannabis which was one

597
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:37,278
of the papers we discussed uh now we are

598
00:28:34,359 --> 00:28:40,398
able to do this meristem culture because

599
00:28:37,278 --> 00:28:43,398
now formulation is ready to even

600
00:28:40,398 --> 00:28:46,798
regenerate uh whole plant from very

601
00:28:43,398 --> 00:28:50,000
small tiny amount of the epical Dome I'm

602
00:28:46,798 --> 00:28:55,278
talking about 0.2 to

603
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:58,359
0.5 mm of the TP Hep of the shoot wow

604
00:28:55,278 --> 00:29:00,038
that makes so much more sense to me I I

605
00:28:58,359 --> 00:29:01,798
heard of you know meristematic tissue

606
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:04,480
culture but I didn't really understand

607
00:29:01,798 --> 00:29:07,000
the reasoning behind it so you're saying

608
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:10,880
because that shoot tip at the very top

609
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:13,000
of the plant um let's I always use the

610
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,440
Christmas tree example you know the

611
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,119
apical dominance the plant wants to grow

612
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,240
straight up we don't want our plant to

613
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:21,599
grow like that we want to create a

614
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:23,240
canopy so we typically remove that that

615
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:24,839
apical dominance so that the lateral

616
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:29,200
branching were occur so we think

617
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:31,319
candelabra shape rather than um

618
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,840
uh Christmas tree shape trying to use

619
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:37,839
visual examples people branchy branchy

620
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:40,759
yes so we get a more even canopy indoors

621
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:42,918
um and I wasn't aware that so because

622
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:45,079
the xylem and flum have not fully formed

623
00:29:42,919 --> 00:29:48,320
in that meristematic tissue it's going

624
00:29:45,079 --> 00:29:50,240
to have a lower viral viroid load

625
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:53,359
already that's really interesting I want

626
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:56,319
to highlight that um if we were topping

627
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:58,558
our plants to you know destroy that

628
00:29:56,319 --> 00:30:00,918
apical dominance to create that

629
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:04,000
canopy already can we still take the

630
00:30:00,919 --> 00:30:05,799
meristematic tips from other uh shoots

631
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,480
on the plant so essentially the End

632
00:30:05,798 --> 00:30:13,200
branch of any of our branches rather

633
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:14,240
than just the very top most dominant

634
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,440
apical

635
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:21,200
location apical meristic tissue on the

636
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:25,240
plant H yes Tad uh so basically every

637
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:27,200
single B is capable of making new shoots

638
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,558
in the tissue culture you are in fact

639
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:32,240
you are forc

640
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:34,798
even d uh dormant B in the tissue

641
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:37,120
culture start to grow and that's

642
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:41,240
starting grow is the very good material

643
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:44,319
for for maram culture so basically even

644
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:47,480
I have just I have just as an example if

645
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:51,158
I have a 20 cm of Branch it's already

646
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:52,200
have five Bots I just take a piece of

647
00:30:51,159 --> 00:30:55,639
those

648
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:58,038
stems including BS put them in the

649
00:30:55,638 --> 00:31:01,319
sterilzation put them in the medium

650
00:30:58,038 --> 00:31:04,359
culture force them to grow bods and

651
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:06,720
break the dorcy and force them to to

652
00:31:04,359 --> 00:31:07,959
grow and that's a that's the starting

653
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:11,519
material

654
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:14,240
formation take the TP of the shoot so

655
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:17,038
the tip of the shoot of any point of the

656
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:20,038
branch will give you that ah okay okay

657
00:31:17,038 --> 00:31:21,960
that makes a lot more sense to me um

658
00:31:20,038 --> 00:31:25,599
wonderful well can we talk a little bit

659
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:27,639
more about hydr hydricity because that

660
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:29,599
was a term that I was not familiar with

661
00:31:27,638 --> 00:31:31,959
I had had seen plants with hydr

662
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:34,599
hydricity before heing my talk but I

663
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:36,440
didn't know that term so can you

664
00:31:34,599 --> 00:31:38,319
describe that unfortunately this being a

665
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:40,278
podcast I'll try to put some photos up

666
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:42,119
on the podcast page so folks can go and

667
00:31:40,278 --> 00:31:45,440
see what we're talking about right now

668
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:48,678
but how would you describe hydr

669
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:52,000
hydricity uh yes when we are taking a

670
00:31:48,679 --> 00:31:54,759
stems and and inserting on the very

671
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:58,519
nutritious medium the medium has a

672
00:31:54,759 --> 00:32:02,558
plenty water and and plant does not have

673
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:04,558
a root to control the intake of water

674
00:32:02,558 --> 00:32:06,038
they are taking up too much water

675
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:10,000
because they don't have a organ to

676
00:32:06,038 --> 00:32:13,919
control absorption of water or minerals

677
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:16,398
so when they take up too much we know in

678
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:19,159
the plant tissue there is a cells and

679
00:32:16,398 --> 00:32:21,558
also there is an intercellular space

680
00:32:19,159 --> 00:32:25,360
which usually is very humid but is

681
00:32:21,558 --> 00:32:28,240
filled by air but in the

682
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:31,918
hyperhydricity this water comes in and

683
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:34,278
feel those intercellular space and

684
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:37,480
that's a c then the the plant cannot

685
00:32:34,278 --> 00:32:41,359
take a breath and do their respiration

686
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:44,399
and that's caused hyperhydricity or also

687
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:46,479
known as a vitrification this is not

688
00:32:44,398 --> 00:32:49,319
only happening in cannabis in cannabis

689
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:53,480
is very often because formulation of

690
00:32:49,319 --> 00:32:58,278
medium was not uh optimized uh and we

691
00:32:53,480 --> 00:33:00,480
did this part uh year ago uh but also Al

692
00:32:58,278 --> 00:33:03,638
it's happening in the other species some

693
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:08,759
species are more more resilient compared

694
00:33:03,638 --> 00:33:08,759
to others but also it's happening in the

695
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:14,079
Alles yeah I remember when I saw it it

696
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:14,919
reminded me uh a little bit of when a

697
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:18,638
plant

698
00:33:14,919 --> 00:33:21,600
Reves uh in the sense that it it looked

699
00:33:18,638 --> 00:33:24,558
like just a very confused

700
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:28,678
hormonal stress response where it's just

701
00:33:24,558 --> 00:33:31,319
a bunch of like twisting and yellowing

702
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:33,000
uh just a very unhappy looking it

703
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:36,839
doesn't even look like a plant at that

704
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:40,720
point it's a very weird look to it um

705
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:43,000
beyond the fact that it looks funny what

706
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:45,679
I assume the success rates of those

707
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:48,319
plants go down does the does the quality

708
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:51,240
of the plant go down as well when this

709
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:55,038
does absolutely absolutely the success

710
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:58,159
rate remarkably goes down so if you take

711
00:33:55,038 --> 00:34:01,158
a plant hyper hydricity plant and take

712
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:04,360
it to and put in the me medium in the

713
00:34:01,159 --> 00:34:06,760
pots and try to acclimate them the

714
00:34:04,359 --> 00:34:09,918
success rate is very low usually in

715
00:34:06,759 --> 00:34:13,239
cannabis we get more than 95% of healthy

716
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:15,960
plant acclimated but when you when you

717
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:18,638
take it yeah because it's it's has a

718
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:21,760
root it has a healthy leaves and they

719
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:25,159
can they can quickly adapts in the pot

720
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:28,359
and soil but uh it comes from tissue

721
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:31,559
culture to to uh to uh to soil

722
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:34,838
but in the case of Hy hyperhydricity

723
00:34:31,559 --> 00:34:37,759
plant they are they are very vulnerable

724
00:34:34,838 --> 00:34:41,358
for losing water and they usually get

725
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:44,359
desiccated and the and the rate is Dro

726
00:34:41,358 --> 00:34:48,000
remarkably maybe to 10% to 20% in my

727
00:34:44,358 --> 00:34:50,679
hand so it's very difficult but uh the

728
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:54,239
one is surviving you can see the new

729
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:57,160
growth turns back the the turns uh

730
00:34:54,239 --> 00:35:00,078
making new new leaves new shoots the

731
00:34:57,159 --> 00:35:03,838
ones surviving they back to the normal

732
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:06,599
because this artificial uh impact of the

733
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:11,799
uh inside the tissue culture jar make it

734
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:11,800
this adverse uh reaction for for the

735
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:18,239
plant okay I have a couple questions so

736
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:21,920
one is uh you mentioned going from this

737
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:24,199
tissue culture media into actual soil

738
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:26,079
when does that occur in the process and

739
00:35:24,199 --> 00:35:28,759
is there any

740
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:31,760
special things that we need to do as you

741
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:34,720
go from this media into a more

742
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:40,400
traditional growing media like soil

743
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:44,000
potting soil yes yeah uh cannabis like

744
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:46,400
many other species also need acclimation

745
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:50,280
in the in the tissue culture vessels

746
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:53,800
they are in the Clos environment and the

747
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:57,160
relative humidity is almost close to the

748
00:35:53,800 --> 00:36:00,519
100% And therefore they don't make it

749
00:35:57,159 --> 00:36:03,759
too much cuticle or wax in the surface

750
00:36:00,519 --> 00:36:06,639
of the leaves they are more vulnerable

751
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:09,040
to losing water because they have been

752
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:11,279
very in the fancy environment they never

753
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:14,279
think about they had to they had to

754
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:17,800
produce wax to protect their leaves and

755
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:20,079
surface of the evaporation and uh

756
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:23,000
transpiration uh therefore when you are

757
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:27,160
T when the complete plant including

758
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:30,079
roots and shs made in the tissue culture

759
00:36:27,159 --> 00:36:33,879
uh with can we can take them out from

760
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:37,160
the vessels and wash a residue of the

761
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:39,119
tissue culture because uh medium because

762
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:41,159
usually they are very nutritious you

763
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:43,800
don't want to have them and we can wash

764
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:46,799
it easily and then we can plant them in

765
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:49,680
the either Rock full plugs or Jey pot or

766
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:52,318
even directly on on the triple mix

767
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:56,000
formulation the only things in the first

768
00:36:52,318 --> 00:36:58,559
two weeks needs humid condition so

769
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,639
usually as a good practice those pots

770
00:36:58,559 --> 00:37:05,000
can go to the standard tray and covered

771
00:37:01,639 --> 00:37:07,639
by the transparent Dome those Dome also

772
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:10,119
has a some vent on top and at the

773
00:37:07,639 --> 00:37:13,279
beginning the first few days you don't

774
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:16,160
CL open the vent just let them acclimate

775
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:19,359
themselves and gradually over the days

776
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:21,799
in two days H sorry in two weeks uh

777
00:37:19,358 --> 00:37:23,920
period you can open the vent and get

778
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:27,119
them acclimated eventually you can take

779
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:30,240
out the Dome and they will be adapted to

780
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:32,920
the ambient condition

781
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:35,078
conditions are we maintaining I I would

782
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:38,720
assume with no cuticle layer we probably

783
00:37:35,079 --> 00:37:42,000
need to keep the light levels similar to

784
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:45,719
that what 120 uh micro moles per second

785
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:48,400
sort of range exactly you're gradually

786
00:37:45,719 --> 00:37:50,679
increasing it yes at the beginning maybe

787
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:55,519
first two three days would be the same

788
00:37:50,679 --> 00:37:57,559
level as as tissue culture uh level the

789
00:37:55,519 --> 00:38:01,519
light density but you can increase the

790
00:37:57,559 --> 00:38:04,440
to 200 slowly maybe second week to up to

791
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:08,480
300 where we are using for the

792
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:12,240
conventional uh cuttings so 250 to 300

793
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:15,519
can go uh over period of two

794
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:19,199
weeks well this plant at that

795
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:22,800
stage look like a

796
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:24,078
colonal propagation cutting or will it

797
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:27,280
look

798
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:31,240
different uh if you take a look it's a

799
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:33,640
very similar the leaves and leaves uh is

800
00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:36,399
very similar healthy leaves and the same

801
00:38:33,639 --> 00:38:38,960
as cuttings but you don't see the main

802
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:41,880
stem in the cuting you can see the main

803
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:45,559
stem of mother plant right and the root

804
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:47,800
comes out of out of uh main stem of

805
00:38:45,559 --> 00:38:50,880
mother plant here is you can see

806
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:53,119
probably two or three branches and they

807
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:58,358
are they are much narrower and you don't

808
00:38:53,119 --> 00:39:00,720
see any any any any part of the tissue

809
00:38:58,358 --> 00:39:04,559
comes from mother plant they made it by

810
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:07,358
own right so they are the stems is

811
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:09,519
tinier and doesn't have the main body or

812
00:39:07,358 --> 00:39:12,440
main

813
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:15,079
trunk that's a difference that that

814
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:17,000
clone that was cloned off of a stem

815
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:18,800
looks uh is going to look more like a

816
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,960
traditional plant because the roots are

817
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,519
going to be coming right out of that

818
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:24,559
stem but you don't get that with it

819
00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:28,239
tissue culture plant because there's no

820
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:32,639
original stem then is that exactly

821
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:34,838
yes okay yes uh but eventually tad after

822
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:38,519
after few weeks if you grow them

823
00:39:34,838 --> 00:39:40,799
together the cuting the plant originated

824
00:39:38,519 --> 00:39:43,480
from cuting versus the tissue culture if

825
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:46,800
you grow them after few weeks really

826
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:49,440
hard to to identify which one is which

827
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:51,920
uh but both of them again I just want to

828
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:54,720
emphasize both of them because they have

829
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:57,559
taken from veget vegetative part of the

830
00:39:54,719 --> 00:40:00,919
plant they are we call it true to tide

831
00:39:57,559 --> 00:40:03,039
they are identical to the mother plant

832
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:04,639
and that's why we can use it for a

833
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:10,318
commercial

834
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:14,039
use wonderful and getting back to this

835
00:40:10,318 --> 00:40:17,279
hyperhydricity that is purely an issue

836
00:40:14,039 --> 00:40:19,039
with the media that people are using in

837
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:21,200
tissue culture which was one of your

838
00:40:19,039 --> 00:40:22,838
papers was looking reviewing what was

839
00:40:21,199 --> 00:40:25,960
currently being used and talking about

840
00:40:22,838 --> 00:40:27,960
how to optimize that process can you

841
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:30,079
talk a little bit more about

842
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:33,039
about that in

843
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:36,480
general yes uh maybe now I can explain

844
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:39,920
about this paper so uh we found the

845
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:42,838
exist uh existing uh medium doesn't work

846
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:46,119
properly at least not for at least 50

847
00:40:42,838 --> 00:40:50,000
different strain we have used so we one

848
00:40:46,119 --> 00:40:53,280
of the main component uh of of tissue

849
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:56,440
culture medium is minerals minerals more

850
00:40:53,280 --> 00:41:00,040
or less the same minerals uh we are

851
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:03,760
using for for cannabis but with at the

852
00:41:00,039 --> 00:41:07,000
less lesser concentration of course and

853
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:11,319
we found this is not working so I put

854
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:14,440
those uh I uh take of some statistic and

855
00:41:11,318 --> 00:41:17,400
experimental method design it to just

856
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:21,400
see which minerals is high or which

857
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:24,358
mineral is low to optimize the uh this

858
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:27,920
balance and formulation for cannabis

859
00:41:24,358 --> 00:41:30,960
after several round of the add Ing and

860
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:33,440
reducing different group of minerals we

861
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:38,358
found that calcium magnesium pottassium

862
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:41,800
are low in the existing uh Ms medium so

863
00:41:38,358 --> 00:41:44,440
by elevation those we we were able to

864
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:48,359
get the better growth that was the first

865
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:50,639
step we have done was good founding the

866
00:41:48,358 --> 00:41:53,078
whole tissue we just compare it and I

867
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:56,039
have some pictures in the paper showing

868
00:41:53,079 --> 00:41:58,039
that this is a control medium existing

869
00:41:56,039 --> 00:42:00,679
medium and this is a impr improv medium

870
00:41:58,039 --> 00:42:03,318
plant larger better

871
00:42:00,679 --> 00:42:05,399
branch and can can you touch on that

872
00:42:03,318 --> 00:42:08,159
what your control was in terms of what

873
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:10,480
what was this existing medium that yeah

874
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:12,559
is it yeah yeah that was my question

875
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:15,760
absolutely yeah but one of the general

876
00:42:12,559 --> 00:42:19,199
medium extensively being used for many

877
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:23,480
species they call it masiku Masashi and

878
00:42:19,199 --> 00:42:25,679
C or H by aration Ms medium this Ms

879
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:28,800
medium was in the market and they put

880
00:42:25,679 --> 00:42:30,919
the label they are good for cannabis and

881
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:33,559
that was based on the public previous

882
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:35,838
publication has been done years ago but

883
00:42:33,559 --> 00:42:38,480
it turns out it doesn't because the the

884
00:42:35,838 --> 00:42:41,239
researchers that just used one or two

885
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:44,440
strain so didn't apply for the all the

886
00:42:41,239 --> 00:42:46,679
strains and we tested for the massive

887
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:49,960
number of a strain and we found it this

888
00:42:46,679 --> 00:42:52,679
is probably has not been it this is not

889
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:55,599
optimiz medium for many many strains so

890
00:42:52,679 --> 00:42:59,039
we have to optimize medium to have a

891
00:42:55,599 --> 00:43:00,838
versatile formul for all this rain

892
00:42:59,039 --> 00:43:04,039
across the Cannabis

893
00:43:00,838 --> 00:43:06,639
industry and so this is the first step

894
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:09,358
the Second Step but we had a better

895
00:43:06,639 --> 00:43:13,879
growth in the with the new formulation

896
00:43:09,358 --> 00:43:17,039
by elevating few Min element but we we

897
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:21,000
didn't solve the hyperhydricity still

898
00:43:17,039 --> 00:43:23,679
plan taking up too much and again put

899
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:26,440
them in the intercellular space water in

900
00:43:23,679 --> 00:43:29,159
the intercellular space and they have it

901
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:32,480
some Mal formality as you described

902
00:43:29,159 --> 00:43:35,679
earlier so that's also we went to the

903
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:39,838
literature what is the remedy for the

904
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:43,639
hyperhydricity and we tried uh multiple

905
00:43:39,838 --> 00:43:46,599
uh chemicals and we found silicate

906
00:43:43,639 --> 00:43:50,239
potassium silicate addition of potassium

907
00:43:46,599 --> 00:43:54,280
silicate to the medium can

908
00:43:50,239 --> 00:43:56,519
extensively control the incident of

909
00:43:54,280 --> 00:44:00,319
hyperhydricity that's what what we found

910
00:43:56,519 --> 00:44:04,639
it so by addition of the silicate now we

911
00:44:00,318 --> 00:44:07,440
know also silicate is very uh very uh

912
00:44:04,639 --> 00:44:09,598
helpful to grow cannabis and healthy

913
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:11,200
cannabis there is a line of evidence

914
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:15,760
showing that even application of

915
00:44:11,199 --> 00:44:19,480
silicate also Elevate the resistance uh

916
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:22,680
cannabis against P medum this is a very

917
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:25,240
recent uh founding by adding but this is

918
00:44:22,679 --> 00:44:27,719
for us is just the control of the

919
00:44:25,239 --> 00:44:29,279
hyperhydricity addition of the

920
00:44:27,719 --> 00:44:33,358
potassium

921
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:35,960
silicate improve the uh reduce the

922
00:44:33,358 --> 00:44:40,000
incident of hyper

923
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:43,000
hydis that's that's wonderful um I'm I'm

924
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:45,920
a big proponent for potassium silicate

925
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:48,559
uh and silic silica in general with

926
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:51,358
cannabis uh you see so many benefits

927
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:52,920
later on in different plant stages so it

928
00:44:51,358 --> 00:44:56,480
sounds like if I'm understanding you

929
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:58,800
correctly the big breakthrough was um

930
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:02,480
twofold so one you found that for the

931
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:05,240
vast majority of uh genetic diversity in

932
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:09,880
cannabis that the the control the MS

933
00:45:05,239 --> 00:45:11,279
media was low in calcium and magnesium I

934
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:14,079
think you might have said potassium as

935
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:16,480
well specifically relative to where it

936
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:18,200
could be for optimizing the tissue

937
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:20,440
culture process and you talk about that

938
00:45:18,199 --> 00:45:23,039
in your paper and then the addition of

939
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:24,720
potassium silicate really solved this

940
00:45:23,039 --> 00:45:27,239
hyperhydricity issue that you were

941
00:45:24,719 --> 00:45:28,838
seeing as well so it was sort of of a

942
00:45:27,239 --> 00:45:33,078
combination of those two things that

943
00:45:28,838 --> 00:45:36,400
really improved the media quality um yes

944
00:45:33,079 --> 00:45:39,318
exactly overall exactly yeah that's that

945
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:44,160
was exactly but the last challenge we

946
00:45:39,318 --> 00:45:47,440
had and uh again we now we solve we had

947
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:51,960
a better growth was very good we had

948
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:55,159
also uh control the hyperhydricity was

949
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:57,358
also big success but rooting of the

950
00:45:55,159 --> 00:46:00,879
Cannabis was the know the last challenge

951
00:45:57,358 --> 00:46:03,358
we had so sometimes cannabis can stay

952
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:04,519
stay there growing growing and there's

953
00:46:03,358 --> 00:46:08,519
you get no

954
00:46:04,519 --> 00:46:10,480
Ruth and root processing is not did not

955
00:46:08,519 --> 00:46:15,280
happen

956
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:18,559
and we try many what would be the best

957
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:21,079
options uh we found it even so because

958
00:46:18,559 --> 00:46:23,960
each step we are using uh different

959
00:46:21,079 --> 00:46:26,039
hormones and we found that even unlike

960
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:29,240
was again previous report saying that

961
00:46:26,039 --> 00:46:32,079
use the root roting hormone like IBA to

962
00:46:29,239 --> 00:46:36,879
root we found that rooting

963
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:39,800
IBA as suprising is repressing rooting

964
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:40,880
process in cannabis it's unlike many

965
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:45,280
different

966
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:48,760
species and by removing IBA we will

967
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:53,680
improve the roting process just the no

968
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:57,000
hormones and also I mimic so you can

969
00:46:53,679 --> 00:47:01,118
imagine we had a shoot with the leaves

970
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:04,639
with the stems with the almost 3 cm with

971
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:09,079
no roots I consider this as a as a

972
00:47:04,639 --> 00:47:11,679
cuttings I said what if I take this part

973
00:47:09,079 --> 00:47:14,200
and putting the in again in the EST

974
00:47:11,679 --> 00:47:15,159
condition putting the Rock full plug and

975
00:47:14,199 --> 00:47:17,719
give them

976
00:47:15,159 --> 00:47:21,039
fertilizer acting like this is a small

977
00:47:17,719 --> 00:47:24,399
cutting and the result was amazing in

978
00:47:21,039 --> 00:47:28,880
three weeks we were able to get them

979
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:31,680
rooted and D plug yeah the picture is is

980
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:34,200
in the paper saying that is just the we

981
00:47:31,679 --> 00:47:36,679
just mimic the what we are they are

982
00:47:34,199 --> 00:47:39,558
using in the commercial scale just a

983
00:47:36,679 --> 00:47:43,039
withit a smaller section a smaller size

984
00:47:39,559 --> 00:47:45,839
almost one inch to to one and a half

985
00:47:43,039 --> 00:47:48,960
inch shoot with no root we inserted to

986
00:47:45,838 --> 00:47:52,159
the plugs and we water them with the

987
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:56,159
esteroide fertilizer and we kept them in

988
00:47:52,159 --> 00:47:58,480
the new uh vessels they rooted and

989
00:47:56,159 --> 00:48:01,960
directly this going go to the larger

990
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:01,960
part for the commercial

991
00:48:02,239 --> 00:48:09,558
scale so is this rooting issue specific

992
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:13,240
to certain genetics or is it was it an

993
00:48:09,559 --> 00:48:16,920
issue across the board with all the

994
00:48:13,239 --> 00:48:20,639
plants most most of the cultiv did not

995
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:23,240
root in the in the medium contained

996
00:48:20,639 --> 00:48:25,679
rotin hormones and some of them they

997
00:48:23,239 --> 00:48:30,199
last if we have to keep them more than

998
00:48:25,679 --> 00:48:32,440
four months to a small portion of them

999
00:48:30,199 --> 00:48:34,719
and they get rooted to my understanding

1000
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:37,039
because IBA over four months get

1001
00:48:34,719 --> 00:48:39,078
degradated that's why they rooted

1002
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:41,639
because ibaa was

1003
00:48:39,079 --> 00:48:45,119
degradated and so interesting because

1004
00:48:41,639 --> 00:48:47,199
when I think of clonal propagation IBA

1005
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:48,720
is typically a a very common rooting

1006
00:48:47,199 --> 00:48:50,879
hormone that's used and it's very

1007
00:48:48,719 --> 00:48:52,439
effective in rooting but in tissue

1008
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:56,160
culture you're saying it's the opposite

1009
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:59,159
effect so that's that's fascinating um

1010
00:48:56,159 --> 00:49:00,639
so if we had let's just say we had a 100

1011
00:48:59,159 --> 00:49:02,639
different

1012
00:49:00,639 --> 00:49:06,759
genetic cannabis

1013
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:10,318
plants what percent of those using this

1014
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:12,960
updated media that you formulated and

1015
00:49:10,318 --> 00:49:14,759
with the potassium silicate um what

1016
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:17,760
percent of those would still experience

1017
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,760
hydrohydrazination

1018
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:34,358
so uh by the new formulation followed by

1019
00:49:31,798 --> 00:49:37,559
the rooting on the Rock wo in the estro

1020
00:49:34,358 --> 00:49:41,000
condition I would say the majority of

1021
00:49:37,559 --> 00:49:43,720
them might be over than 90 to

1022
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:47,760
95% they will successfully get the

1023
00:49:43,719 --> 00:49:50,000
rooted and those rooted will be uh uh

1024
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:53,400
would be acclimated successfully for

1025
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:56,719
them for the commercial use um I have

1026
00:49:53,400 --> 00:50:00,039
done at least more than more than 100

1027
00:49:56,719 --> 00:50:02,519
different strains in the this new

1028
00:50:00,039 --> 00:50:05,880
formulation some of them they grow

1029
00:50:02,519 --> 00:50:07,000
better than others but we we did not

1030
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:10,559
have any

1031
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:13,159
loss we some of them they yeah we didn't

1032
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:15,440
have any loss so this is a really

1033
00:50:13,159 --> 00:50:18,598
versatile I can say it's a versatile

1034
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:22,119
formulation for the all cultiv wars for

1035
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:25,079
cannabis did you see any hydr hydr

1036
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:27,400
hyperhydricity in the new formulation

1037
00:50:25,079 --> 00:50:31,000
with certain genetics

1038
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:34,318
yes it's a a small portion of them in

1039
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:36,920
some strains showing still showing some

1040
00:50:34,318 --> 00:50:40,279
hyperhydricity but not all of them for

1041
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:43,318
example if you make it make it 100 some

1042
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:46,160
cultivos may be showing 10 to 15% of

1043
00:50:43,318 --> 00:50:49,519
them hyperhydricity but

1044
00:50:46,159 --> 00:50:52,239
85% uh they are they are growing well

1045
00:50:49,519 --> 00:50:54,480
and also in other other cultiv Wares

1046
00:50:52,239 --> 00:50:58,199
even you don't see barely you you see

1047
00:50:54,480 --> 00:51:02,639
any of them uh so this variability of

1048
00:50:58,199 --> 00:51:05,719
hyper hardcity is still happening but

1049
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:09,480
they are now in the much smaller portion

1050
00:51:05,719 --> 00:51:14,118
compared to the uh previous

1051
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:17,679
formulation So based on your research um

1052
00:51:14,119 --> 00:51:18,880
your recommendation would be to use this

1053
00:51:17,679 --> 00:51:21,199
updated

1054
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:22,640
formulation that you've come up with is

1055
00:51:21,199 --> 00:51:25,199
along with you know the potassium

1056
00:51:22,639 --> 00:51:27,199
silicate the higher levels of cations I

1057
00:51:25,199 --> 00:51:30,879
and then uh

1058
00:51:27,199 --> 00:51:32,639
after a at a certain stage taking those

1059
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:35,960
shoots that you've created and putting

1060
00:51:32,639 --> 00:51:37,558
them into a Rockwell media to Rockwell

1061
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:40,119
Cube and then giving them a low-level

1062
00:51:37,559 --> 00:51:42,720
fertilizer to increase rooting

1063
00:51:40,119 --> 00:51:45,640
productivity before reaching that

1064
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:48,000
final I guess plant that is able to go

1065
00:51:45,639 --> 00:51:51,798
back out into the commercial

1066
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:55,039
facility yes yes that's our finding we

1067
00:51:51,798 --> 00:51:57,440
found this is the best way so far but

1068
00:51:55,039 --> 00:52:00,159
but this is a science there's a no end

1069
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:02,440
maybe maybe in the future different

1070
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:05,519
group finding even better or more

1071
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:07,639
simpler solution but for now I believe

1072
00:52:05,519 --> 00:52:10,798
this is a very good approach for the

1073
00:52:07,639 --> 00:52:13,440
commercial scale make a healthy plant

1074
00:52:10,798 --> 00:52:16,159
now because now we have this formulation

1075
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:18,960
now we can do marem culture to get rid

1076
00:52:16,159 --> 00:52:21,759
of the virus now we can preserve uh

1077
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:25,679
plant material in the very uh small

1078
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:28,400
footprint of the uh shelf now we can

1079
00:52:25,679 --> 00:52:32,399
also get the uh some systemic pathogen

1080
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:35,639
like a fusarium is very common in Canada

1081
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:38,000
U and we can we we can use the growing

1082
00:52:35,639 --> 00:52:41,199
uh growing point and get them uh take

1083
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:43,679
them out and re regenerate the new plant

1084
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:47,000
and get rid of the pathion so those

1085
00:52:43,679 --> 00:52:50,000
Downstream application now is possible

1086
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:51,838
because the foundation is already

1087
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:54,039
made yeah I think you brought up a

1088
00:52:51,838 --> 00:52:57,000
really good point about science is uh

1089
00:52:54,039 --> 00:52:59,798
what you've created is now a replicable

1090
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,239
formulation that anyone in theory any

1091
00:52:59,798 --> 00:53:03,679
other scientist or someone in the world

1092
00:53:01,239 --> 00:53:06,039
could recreate these conditions and and

1093
00:53:03,679 --> 00:53:08,039
show the same level of success and and

1094
00:53:06,039 --> 00:53:10,480
maybe down the road you someone will

1095
00:53:08,039 --> 00:53:12,199
will discover a better process and

1096
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:13,599
hopefully share that with the world and

1097
00:53:12,199 --> 00:53:17,639
that's what's great about collaboration

1098
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:19,519
and science um versus say keeping this

1099
00:53:17,639 --> 00:53:23,199
knowledge within your company and not

1100
00:53:19,519 --> 00:53:25,280
allowing um anyone else to really really

1101
00:53:23,199 --> 00:53:27,279
utilize this knowledge uh it definitely

1102
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:30,480
slows down this the process of our

1103
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:32,640
industry in improving and learning um

1104
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:36,358
collectively so I thank you for

1105
00:53:32,639 --> 00:53:39,118
that thank you very much uh again you

1106
00:53:36,358 --> 00:53:43,000
you again mentioned a very nice Point

1107
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:46,039
even I had two options to do it uh make

1108
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:49,079
it public information and share this

1109
00:53:46,039 --> 00:53:51,519
this experience with the new industry

1110
00:53:49,079 --> 00:53:54,039
which is quite thirsty for the knowledge

1111
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:58,639
of cannabis and tissue culture or make

1112
00:53:54,039 --> 00:54:02,318
it patent I I was moving to to the first

1113
00:53:58,639 --> 00:54:04,598
option I and I convince uh everyone to

1114
00:54:02,318 --> 00:54:08,079
to just make it public information for

1115
00:54:04,599 --> 00:54:11,480
the industry uh that was uh I think one

1116
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:13,680
of the things I'm very very proud and

1117
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:15,838
happy is just make it this one public

1118
00:54:13,679 --> 00:54:18,558
information because not many is

1119
00:54:15,838 --> 00:54:18,558
available for

1120
00:54:19,318 --> 00:54:24,719
cannabis yeah I I think that's very

1121
00:54:21,679 --> 00:54:26,399
important um and probably less

1122
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:28,519
profitable but I think very important so

1123
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:30,400
so I do I do truly appreciate that thank

1124
00:54:28,519 --> 00:54:32,920
you thank

1125
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:35,318
you so I just have a couple more

1126
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:39,400
questions uh one of the questions that I

1127
00:54:35,318 --> 00:54:43,119
had is is how expensive would it be for

1128
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:44,599
a facility to either you know and these

1129
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:47,000
are going to be approximate because

1130
00:54:44,599 --> 00:54:48,240
every every situation or every company

1131
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:51,920
is going to be different but what what

1132
00:54:48,239 --> 00:54:54,439
should a company expect to pay uh to get

1133
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:58,039
genetics cleaned through a third- party

1134
00:54:54,440 --> 00:55:01,798
lab or to on top of that what would it

1135
00:54:58,039 --> 00:55:03,880
cost approximately for a larger canas

1136
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:07,599
facility to set up their own

1137
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:10,160
lab um and do tissue culture in house

1138
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:12,798
yeah I prefer uh to answer your first

1139
00:55:10,159 --> 00:55:17,679
question uh saying that how long it

1140
00:55:12,798 --> 00:55:20,119
takes uh to to provide uh Lab Services

1141
00:55:17,679 --> 00:55:23,759
uh if we were talking about the mem

1142
00:55:20,119 --> 00:55:27,680
culture I said uh takes 9 to 10

1143
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:31,520
months but uh for the other service like

1144
00:55:27,679 --> 00:55:34,879
elimination of the systemic pathogen or

1145
00:55:31,519 --> 00:55:38,960
clean up get rid of the all pading me

1146
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:42,079
you any pest or or or eggs of the uh

1147
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:45,358
pest in the from the mother plant this

1148
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:48,640
is a very quick and it takes it about

1149
00:55:45,358 --> 00:55:52,519
three to four months so it's very uh

1150
00:55:48,639 --> 00:55:54,879
very uh quick and short only only mistem

1151
00:55:52,519 --> 00:55:57,318
culture takes longer because really you

1152
00:55:54,880 --> 00:56:01,720
start with the very small

1153
00:55:57,318 --> 00:56:05,318
uh amount of the tissue uh back to the

1154
00:56:01,719 --> 00:56:08,519
cost of the lab it's

1155
00:56:05,318 --> 00:56:11,759
varies country to countes and depends

1156
00:56:08,519 --> 00:56:16,038
but if for the if they license holder

1157
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:19,559
are interested to have a lab as a part

1158
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:24,559
or a small Department within the whole

1159
00:56:19,559 --> 00:56:27,400
company this can be done I believe uh

1160
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:30,480
between half a million to 1 milon by

1161
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:32,639
just and also depending of the sizes we

1162
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:35,599
they usually needed three different

1163
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:38,199
compartments one for incubation one for

1164
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:42,440
operation and one as a kitchen of the

1165
00:56:38,199 --> 00:56:45,358
lab and yeah that's a that's a part of

1166
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:48,440
my job in the past to design those parts

1167
00:56:45,358 --> 00:56:51,960
and and put the all equipment there is

1168
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:54,000
not expensive as they think uh people

1169
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:57,920
are saying that lab is very expensive

1170
00:56:54,000 --> 00:57:00,280
very costly um is not as expensive is

1171
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:02,280
worth it to have a starting healthy

1172
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:04,798
starting material for

1173
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:06,920
production I mean I could absolutely see

1174
00:57:04,798 --> 00:57:09,119
where a large scale facility could

1175
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:10,920
benefit from having something like that

1176
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:13,920
I mean it sounds like a large number to

1177
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:16,920
me are we talking US dollars here or

1178
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:19,720
Canadian or Australian dollars because I

1179
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:21,519
believe us is the best estimation okay

1180
00:57:19,719 --> 00:57:24,639
okay so that that number is in US

1181
00:57:21,519 --> 00:57:27,000
Dollars okay just to get an idea um yeah

1182
00:57:24,639 --> 00:57:29,358
so it really limits the number of

1183
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:32,480
facilities that could do this inhouse so

1184
00:57:29,358 --> 00:57:34,920
assuming we were to send genetics to a

1185
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:38,039
third party would we be looking in the

1186
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:41,519
range of hundreds of dollars per per

1187
00:57:38,039 --> 00:57:43,839
genetic uh plant or thousands tens of

1188
00:57:41,519 --> 00:57:46,759
thousands what would be an expected

1189
00:57:43,838 --> 00:57:49,159
approximate cost and I realize this is

1190
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:50,880
going to be a very very rough number um

1191
00:57:49,159 --> 00:57:53,159
and no one should hold us to it but just

1192
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:54,318
to give listeners a kind of rough idea

1193
00:57:53,159 --> 00:57:56,480
of what something that this might cost

1194
00:57:54,318 --> 00:57:58,599
at the lab

1195
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:01,679
uh I don't know how much does it cost

1196
00:57:58,599 --> 00:58:03,960
for the lab to because again the uh

1197
00:58:01,679 --> 00:58:07,078
labor in different countries is

1198
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:11,599
different but uh I can just

1199
00:58:07,079 --> 00:58:13,880
provide provide some some range but some

1200
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:16,640
some lab that providing those services

1201
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:18,680
for example conservation per year so you

1202
00:58:16,639 --> 00:58:20,558
can make a contract annual contract

1203
00:58:18,679 --> 00:58:23,199
saying that I'm sending you two 10

1204
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:25,039
different qualy Wars you keep it for me

1205
00:58:23,199 --> 00:58:29,759
and you send it back to me whenever I

1206
00:58:25,039 --> 00:58:34,440
need it and this is probably uh cost

1207
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:38,720
between maybe 3 to 6,000 per strain 3

1208
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:42,880
3,000 to 6 6,000 depends again with the

1209
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:45,318
country and currency um that's a for uh

1210
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:46,920
conservation cleaning also could be a

1211
00:58:45,318 --> 00:58:49,880
slightly

1212
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:51,200
cheaper so that that conservation

1213
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:52,960
doesn't

1214
00:58:51,199 --> 00:58:56,598
necessarily

1215
00:58:52,960 --> 00:59:01,798
include cleaning of the the removal of

1216
00:58:56,599 --> 00:59:04,359
viroids or pathogens or pests viroid no

1217
00:59:01,798 --> 00:59:07,199
no viroid no because doesn't go through

1218
00:59:04,358 --> 00:59:10,598
the meristem culture but but they can

1219
00:59:07,199 --> 00:59:13,558
get rid of the systemic pathogen like a

1220
00:59:10,599 --> 00:59:17,960
fusarium or celf phace pathogen like a

1221
00:59:13,559 --> 00:59:20,480
pottering building okay okay yeah and

1222
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:22,079
then for the the cleaning process like

1223
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:25,519
if if you had to do a

1224
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:27,160
meristematic uh tissue culture to remove

1225
00:59:25,519 --> 00:59:28,838
let's just just stay with hoplight and

1226
00:59:27,159 --> 00:59:31,558
vroid because it's it's one of the

1227
00:59:28,838 --> 00:59:34,920
bigger issues right now um what do you

1228
00:59:31,559 --> 00:59:38,640
what do you estimate that might cost for

1229
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:41,318
that eight Monon nine Monon process

1230
00:59:38,639 --> 00:59:46,358
um U I don't know

1231
00:59:41,318 --> 00:59:50,079
that for to be honest but uh again that

1232
00:59:46,358 --> 00:59:53,400
could be a couple of thousand uh to to

1233
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:55,160
get the job done and as and also there

1234
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:58,079
is a some cost is involved for the

1235
00:59:55,159 --> 01:00:01,318
testing and you need you need as you

1236
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:05,400
mentioned it you need a COA to to show

1237
01:00:01,318 --> 01:00:07,679
your client the uh the the paten no

1238
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:11,000
longer exists in this particular cultiv

1239
01:00:07,679 --> 01:00:14,399
bar and then you can send it back I

1240
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:17,119
think again maybe maybe four to

1241
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:19,680
$7,000 that's a that's again could be

1242
01:00:17,119 --> 01:00:22,798
estimation but it's worth it if you get

1243
01:00:19,679 --> 01:00:26,440
the really clean product

1244
01:00:22,798 --> 01:00:27,880
back oh absolutely if it's a key gentic

1245
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:30,280
that's tied to your marketing and

1246
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:33,960
branding and that's a good yielder and

1247
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:35,519
important for your brand um relatively

1248
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:37,599
speaking that's not a large amount of

1249
01:00:35,519 --> 01:00:40,440
money on that scale so I would agree

1250
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:43,160
with you on that um that does bring up I

1251
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:45,159
think probably my uh well I have two

1252
01:00:43,159 --> 01:00:48,199
more questions

1253
01:00:45,159 --> 01:00:49,920
um one question that I I would love to

1254
01:00:48,199 --> 01:00:53,159
hear your thoughts on is how do I

1255
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:55,680
evaluate a third-party lab that offers

1256
01:00:53,159 --> 01:00:59,639
tissue culture Services what are the

1257
01:00:55,679 --> 01:01:01,919
question questions you would ask um or

1258
01:00:59,639 --> 01:01:03,798
what yeah I guess how do you evaluate

1259
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:05,480
them in general because it's really hard

1260
01:01:03,798 --> 01:01:09,599
as someone like myself who's not a

1261
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:12,400
scientist or researcher to know um that

1262
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:13,519
that my money is being spent with a lab

1263
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:17,119
that's going to be able to produce the

1264
01:01:13,519 --> 01:01:19,960
results that I want yeah I think in this

1265
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:22,640
stage we should uh stick to the facts

1266
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:25,240
you can you can ask for the end product

1267
01:01:22,639 --> 01:01:27,440
and see the quality of the end product

1268
01:01:25,239 --> 01:01:30,719
what you see what you are receiving as a

1269
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:33,720
client you can ask them what what they

1270
01:01:30,719 --> 01:01:37,639
are making right now is it really normal

1271
01:01:33,719 --> 01:01:40,759
and plant are healthy second if you are

1272
01:01:37,639 --> 01:01:43,759
looking to eliminate any c specific

1273
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:45,839
pathogens as we mention it earlier you

1274
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:48,480
have to ask for certificate

1275
01:01:45,838 --> 01:01:52,400
analysis uh and maybe this is also will

1276
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:54,760
be another true that accredit lab so ask

1277
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:56,559
them to send a sample and get the

1278
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:59,480
certific analyzis

1279
01:01:56,559 --> 01:02:02,039
give you peace of mind the the plant

1280
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:05,000
tissue culture PL no longer carry carry

1281
01:02:02,039 --> 01:02:06,920
any pathogens this is then would be very

1282
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:09,599
exciting moment for you to bring the

1283
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:12,079
healthy product and put them in

1284
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:15,200
production so getting a certificate of

1285
01:02:12,079 --> 01:02:17,680
analysis from a a a different lab than

1286
01:02:15,199 --> 01:02:20,000
the one that did the tissue culture uh

1287
01:02:17,679 --> 01:02:23,759
could be a way of getting a better

1288
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:25,318
verification as to the the quality of of

1289
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:27,680
what you're getting from the company

1290
01:02:25,318 --> 01:02:32,880
okay that that's a good recommendation

1291
01:02:27,679 --> 01:02:34,838
um okay last question that I had was

1292
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:37,160
um for someone who's passionate about

1293
01:02:34,838 --> 01:02:40,519
organic cultivation are there any

1294
01:02:37,159 --> 01:02:43,000
options that are organic within the

1295
01:02:40,519 --> 01:02:46,559
tissue culture world or micropropagation

1296
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:49,480
or is it really limited to these you

1297
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:49,480
know mineral salt

1298
01:02:49,519 --> 01:02:57,199
formulations uh I think uh to my

1299
01:02:53,639 --> 01:03:00,239
knowledge uh would be very tricky to

1300
01:02:57,199 --> 01:03:03,318
have organic matter in the medium

1301
01:03:00,239 --> 01:03:07,199
because uh plants are very vulnerable in

1302
01:03:03,318 --> 01:03:11,519
this Clos environment and any any

1303
01:03:07,199 --> 01:03:14,519
byproduct can stop them to grow so all

1304
01:03:11,519 --> 01:03:17,519
all the ingredients which is contain

1305
01:03:14,519 --> 01:03:21,199
vitamins contain carbohydrate contain

1306
01:03:17,519 --> 01:03:25,038
also minerals as we discussed has to be

1307
01:03:21,199 --> 01:03:28,239
fine-tuned so I do not recomend I to my

1308
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:31,079
knowledge I don't I cannot imagine the

1309
01:03:28,239 --> 01:03:34,439
uh the organic material one day will be

1310
01:03:31,079 --> 01:03:39,278
in the in the aseptic conditions in the

1311
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:41,400
in vitro condition EST being EST and and

1312
01:03:39,278 --> 01:03:42,760
providing good environment for the plant

1313
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:46,680
for tissue

1314
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:50,039
cure that makes sense uh I think of

1315
01:03:46,679 --> 01:03:52,639
um the plant needing nutrients in ionic

1316
01:03:50,039 --> 01:03:55,278
form uh that they can take up which is

1317
01:03:52,639 --> 01:03:56,759
is challenging in organic production

1318
01:03:55,278 --> 01:03:59,440
because that

1319
01:03:56,760 --> 01:04:02,319
that process is typically uh occurs the

1320
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:04,960
nutrient cycling through microbial

1321
01:04:02,318 --> 01:04:07,558
interactions with uh carbon based

1322
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:09,639
fertilizers and we we need a sterile

1323
01:04:07,559 --> 01:04:12,278
environment where that sort of

1324
01:04:09,639 --> 01:04:15,879
interaction cannot occur so we really

1325
01:04:12,278 --> 01:04:18,318
are forced to use synthetic or mineral

1326
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:20,480
salt chemical chemicals in this in this

1327
01:04:18,318 --> 01:04:22,798
regard so uh thank you for answering

1328
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:24,559
that um I said that was the last

1329
01:04:22,798 --> 01:04:26,599
question and then I realized I missed

1330
01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:28,400
one on my list of questions questions uh

1331
01:04:26,599 --> 01:04:31,039
which was an entire paper that you did

1332
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:33,119
can you just touch here uh I know we've

1333
01:04:31,039 --> 01:04:35,480
we've taken a lot of your time briefly

1334
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:38,079
on what is synthetic seed because I had

1335
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:40,519
never heard that term before seeing uh

1336
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:43,079
seeing it used in your paper can you can

1337
01:04:40,519 --> 01:04:46,119
you touch on that really really quickly

1338
01:04:43,079 --> 01:04:49,359
absolutely uh that U so we know the

1339
01:04:46,119 --> 01:04:52,480
natural seeds and we know also natural

1340
01:04:49,358 --> 01:04:54,400
seed is the result of the pollination

1341
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:57,119
fertilization and in the case of

1342
01:04:54,400 --> 01:05:01,440
cannabis we have male plant we have a

1343
01:04:57,119 --> 01:05:03,798
female and this is seeds is is a result

1344
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:04,760
of the fertilization of the two

1345
01:05:03,798 --> 01:05:08,199
different

1346
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:11,440
individual uh it is more also uh

1347
01:05:08,199 --> 01:05:14,318
important to know uh the seedlings which

1348
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:16,599
is a plant comes from the seeds in

1349
01:05:14,318 --> 01:05:21,519
cannabis they are not

1350
01:05:16,599 --> 01:05:24,680
identical neither to mother or nor a

1351
01:05:21,519 --> 01:05:27,960
father plant they are they are might be

1352
01:05:24,679 --> 01:05:30,838
similar to some extent but they are not

1353
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:33,720
identical unlike cuting or tissue

1354
01:05:30,838 --> 01:05:36,960
culture uh what we are we have done in

1355
01:05:33,719 --> 01:05:40,439
the one year of as a one year of

1356
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:41,240
research where if you take a one piece

1357
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:45,440
of

1358
01:05:41,239 --> 01:05:49,358
tissue I from inerio or even in the

1359
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:51,720
Cannabis we use a again a piece of stems

1360
01:05:49,358 --> 01:05:55,719
with the B we

1361
01:05:51,719 --> 01:05:59,879
encapsulate with the nutritious Matrix

1362
01:05:55,719 --> 01:06:03,199
we usually we use uh sodium algate in

1363
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:05,720
the esto condition in fact we are making

1364
01:06:03,199 --> 01:06:09,278
seed coat for the piece of a stem with

1365
01:06:05,719 --> 01:06:12,679
one bot that's it this is we call it

1366
01:06:09,278 --> 01:06:17,838
artificial seeds or we call it synthetic

1367
01:06:12,679 --> 01:06:21,239
seeds this is a very good tools if you

1368
01:06:17,838 --> 01:06:24,639
want to import plant or conserve plant

1369
01:06:21,239 --> 01:06:27,479
material imagine you can have from one

1370
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:30,440
mother plant even a small size you can

1371
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:35,159
every single node is a potential to be

1372
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:38,880
one seed so you can encapsulate them and

1373
01:06:35,159 --> 01:06:42,558
keep it in the Estero vessels or even

1374
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:44,960
zip lock and our our research shows that

1375
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:48,319
up to six months you can keep them in

1376
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:50,400
the 10 degree centigrade and once you

1377
01:06:48,318 --> 01:06:51,400
take them out and putting the medium

1378
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:54,519
they will

1379
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:57,160
regenerate and it's a very good tool for

1380
01:06:54,519 --> 01:07:01,079
export and in import if you wanted to

1381
01:06:57,159 --> 01:07:03,480
sense from point A to point B from

1382
01:07:01,079 --> 01:07:06,839
different provinces or even different

1383
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:11,400
countries you can uh make encapsulated

1384
01:07:06,838 --> 01:07:14,558
of those those uh seeds from the stems

1385
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:17,519
and put them in the right vessels and

1386
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:19,920
transfer them even room temperature from

1387
01:07:17,519 --> 01:07:22,038
uh from one country to another once they

1388
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:24,440
receive to the destination they can put

1389
01:07:22,039 --> 01:07:27,278
them back to the to the medium and let

1390
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:29,358
them generate and inste of they can get

1391
01:07:27,278 --> 01:07:33,880
if you send thousand probably they In

1392
01:07:29,358 --> 01:07:39,358
The End by this 10% lose loss they get

1393
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:41,519
900 uh 900 plants it's very easy to yeah

1394
01:07:39,358 --> 01:07:44,598
it's a very powerful

1395
01:07:41,519 --> 01:07:46,679
tool thinking about this process I would

1396
01:07:44,599 --> 01:07:49,480
assume that you would want to do this

1397
01:07:46,679 --> 01:07:52,278
with a tissue culture plant first to

1398
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:54,358
remove any pathogens or viruses or

1399
01:07:52,278 --> 01:07:56,480
viroids to make sure you're starting

1400
01:07:54,358 --> 01:07:58,960
with very clean

1401
01:07:56,480 --> 01:08:02,278
material and

1402
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:03,880
then okay and then create these seeds

1403
01:08:02,278 --> 01:08:07,079
that you could ship all around the world

1404
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:10,400
or store for long periods of time uh

1405
01:08:07,079 --> 01:08:12,680
that's really amazing so yeah so the

1406
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:15,838
best scenario you grow them in a tissue

1407
01:08:12,679 --> 01:08:18,358
culture you provide enough material you

1408
01:08:15,838 --> 01:08:21,158
send a piece of those material to this

1409
01:08:18,359 --> 01:08:24,400
to get the COA either from from the

1410
01:08:21,158 --> 01:08:27,719
virid from fusarium verticillum and so

1411
01:08:24,399 --> 01:08:30,759
many and you prove it your mother plant

1412
01:08:27,719 --> 01:08:32,480
is healthy then you can encapsulate them

1413
01:08:30,759 --> 01:08:34,920
and you send it to the anywhere in the

1414
01:08:32,479 --> 01:08:37,318
world with the all certificate so the

1415
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:40,480
quarantine will be much should be much

1416
01:08:37,319 --> 01:08:42,719
easier because because this this is

1417
01:08:40,479 --> 01:08:45,959
already mother plan in the aseptic

1418
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:49,319
condition grown and did not carry any

1419
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:50,920
partitions wonderful well thank you so

1420
01:08:49,319 --> 01:08:53,960
much for your time today and sharing

1421
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:57,440
your research and and sharing this this

1422
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:58,880
wonderful knowledge with uh everyone um

1423
01:08:57,439 --> 01:09:00,759
it was so wonderful I learned I learned

1424
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:04,560
a bunch of stuff uh even just during

1425
01:09:00,759 --> 01:09:07,198
this conversation today so uh thank you

1426
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:10,279
again thank you very much Tad for

1427
01:09:07,198 --> 01:09:14,798
providing this opportunity for me and

1428
01:09:10,279 --> 01:09:14,799
get into contact with your audience
