where we discuss The Cutting Edge of

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,519
growing from a science-based perspective

8
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,840
and drawn top experts from around the

9
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:32,820

at J.R Peters and the formulator of all

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,920
products and development of new

14
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:42,420
fertilizer formulas that provide crop

15
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,640
specific solutions to Growers

16
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:46,620
nutritional issues she has too many

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,179
honors and accolades to list here but I

18
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:51,000
will put them up on the podcast page

19
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:52,738
Carrie has a PHD in plant sciences and a

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,659
Masters of Science and Agronomy from the

21
00:00:52,738 --> 00:00:56,759
University of Maryland as well as a

22
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:58,558
Bachelor's of Science and biology she's

23
00:00:56,759 --> 00:01:00,299
the third generation of Peters in the

24
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:04,859
family business which was founded over

25
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:06,420
72 years ago now on to the show

26
00:01:04,859 --> 00:01:07,618
hey Carrie thanks for coming on the show

27
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,260
today

28
00:01:07,618 --> 00:01:11,760
hi thanks for having me Tad

29
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,520
yeah I know you've been on before

30
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,799
talking about J.R Peters and Jack's

31
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:20,699
fertilizer and some of the you know

32
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:23,700
formulation process uh today I wanted to

33
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,680
talk to you more about uh testing in lab

34
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:29,159
analysis so tell me a little bit about

35
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:32,220
about your lab that you have over at Jax

36
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:35,880
oh yeah well one of the things that I

37
00:01:32,219 --> 00:01:37,140
feel super lucky to be able to have here

38
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:39,658
in Allentown where we make our

39
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:42,420
fertilizer is actually the lab on site

40
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:45,180
so like you know like I was saying you

41
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:47,640
need to come visit but people that have

42
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,799
been there they always kind of say like

43
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:53,399
wow this is unbelievable like in the

44
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:55,380
middle of offices is this laboratory and

45
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:57,118
it really is like the backbone of what

46
00:01:55,379 --> 00:01:59,099
we do

47
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:01,739
um to manufacture fertilizer obviously

48
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:05,158
to make sure we are are making what we

49
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:08,159
think we are but also to get like really

50
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:10,739
data driven information to Growers out

51
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:13,378
there like any Growers not just Growers

52
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:16,080
using Jacks but like people that are

53
00:02:13,378 --> 00:02:18,719
interested to see how their plants are

54
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,860
doing and how to improve and optimize

55
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:24,180
their their crop health and yield so

56
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:26,879
really depending on the crop that

57
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:29,879
they're growing but it's a pretty neat

58
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:31,739
facility it's like smack dab in the

59
00:02:29,878 --> 00:02:34,679
middle of the offices and Manufacturing

60
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:38,039
and we just completed a renovation so

61
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:40,140
the company was formed in 1947 I know

62
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:44,579
you knew that from before but our

63
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:46,639
facility was built in 78 so the lab was

64
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:49,620
like a

65
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:51,500
monster-sized tribute to the 70s Chic

66
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:55,259
you know

67
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:59,159
so this renovation this renovation kind

68
00:02:55,259 --> 00:03:01,139
of took us into the next well the 21st

69
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:03,000
century for sure in the way of appeal

70
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:06,059
but we had all these state-of-the-art

71
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,019
equipment and it looked like a 70s

72
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:10,080
throwback

73
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:12,539
so this new renovation has allowed us to

74
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,879
like utilize space better and really be

75
00:03:12,539 --> 00:03:16,739
able to

76
00:03:13,878 --> 00:03:18,899
increase the throughput of the amount of

77
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:20,340
samples that we do every day here at Jr

78
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:23,099
Peters it's kind of like Groundhog Day

79
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:25,500
our results are out in 24 to 48 hours

80
00:03:23,098 --> 00:03:28,439
and then you repeat that over and over

81
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:31,979
again for tissue testing water testing

82
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:33,658
media fertilizers of course and pretty

83
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:34,859
much anything nutrient nutrient

84
00:03:33,658 --> 00:03:37,400
concentration

85
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,400
yeah

86
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:42,719
so I want to I want to dive into that

87
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:45,060
um much deeper but before we do

88
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:47,699
something that you and I talked about uh

89
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:50,878
in previous off-air conversations was

90
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:54,179
the amount of testing that goes into

91
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:55,620
your products and because

92
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:58,920
um part of our conversation was about

93
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:01,739
how you know when you get a label made

94
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:02,939
you have a guaranteed analysis and so if

95
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:04,980
you're guaranteeing five percent

96
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:06,780
nitrogen you have to be above five

97
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:09,658
percent right and and you were saying

98
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:11,158
within a certain range of that too right

99
00:04:09,658 --> 00:04:12,959
um in theory especially on the chemical

100
00:04:11,158 --> 00:04:13,620
side so

101
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,399
um

102
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:19,858
and also that all your inputs are free

103
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:21,238
and clean of heavy metals

104
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:23,478
yes

105
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:27,899
I'm guessing

106
00:04:23,478 --> 00:04:29,639
chemical nutrient companies have Labs

107
00:04:27,899 --> 00:04:32,638
um what what have you guys found over

108
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:34,019
the years in terms of consistency in

109
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,400
order to maintain consistency what does

110
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:38,219
that look like

111
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:41,819
yeah I mean that's a great question and

112
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:45,720
I always wonder to myself like

113
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:48,300
do people know what kind of

114
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:50,280
qualifications their company their their

115
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:52,439
nutrient companies or anything in life

116
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:54,359
you know like anything we put into our

117
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:55,800
bodies what kind of testing goes on

118
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:59,460
there

119
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:01,978
um for our products having the lab on

120
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:04,019
site is awesome because people always

121
00:05:01,978 --> 00:05:06,719
ask can you send me a certificate of

122
00:05:04,019 --> 00:05:09,299
analysis for your finished Blends and

123
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,639
I'm like can do because that's what

124
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:14,280
everybody thinks that they need which is

125
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:16,819
super true you definitely do but more

126
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:21,179
important than that we

127
00:05:16,819 --> 00:05:23,038
do a lot of qaqc at at the step before

128
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:25,019
that so because we have so many

129
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:26,699
different raw materials and make so many

130
00:05:25,019 --> 00:05:29,758
different blends for ourselves and for

131
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:31,800
others we look at the raw materials as

132
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,620
inputs so as soon as they're brought

133
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:38,579
into the facility they go through a like

134
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:41,100
Suite of tests one being as easy as is

135
00:05:38,579 --> 00:05:43,198
it clear and soluble I mean that sounds

136
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:45,180
silly but like you do that two seconds

137
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,160
later if it's cloudy you don't have to

138
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:48,959
do anything else you know you just like

139
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:52,680
reject that lot

140
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:55,079
but so we look at each individual raw

141
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:57,180
material before it gets housed with the

142
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:59,399
rest of them because we have some

143
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:01,800
large-scale containment facilities you

144
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:04,258
know and if you put in if it's going to

145
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:06,720
hold you know fifteen thousand pounds of

146
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:09,780
something and you put in 2 000 pounds of

147
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:12,120
a lot that isn't wonderful or within

148
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:14,879
spec then you've just contaminated the

149
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:17,280
rest of your material so we take it to

150
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:20,100
the step where we're doing these qaqcs

151
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:22,679
at the beginning stage so then you know

152
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:24,840
when it's Blended we know a hundred

153
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:27,620
percent that it's going to come in Spec

154
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:30,719
in regards to heavy metal

155
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:32,759
calculation and additive value of all

156
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,819
the different raw materials for for the

157
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:37,800
end formula certificate of analysis but

158
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:39,360
if we didn't have that on site

159
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:43,259
I don't know what you do I guess you

160
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:46,259
just like pray that the it is what it is

161
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:50,479
you know the paperwork says it should be

162
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:50,479
this and you can't always go by that

163
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:57,719
yeah I think that's a good point so

164
00:06:54,060 --> 00:07:00,120
I I mean it makes me wonder as a grower

165
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:02,699
who's using

166
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:05,519
you know mineral salts what questions

167
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:07,319
should I be asking my manufacturer to

168
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:10,139
assure that what I'm getting is a

169
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:12,300
quality product inconsistent

170
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:14,699
yeah I mean the certificate of analysis

171
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:16,918
is the number one key I mean if that

172
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:18,900
needs to come in clean so that your

173
00:07:16,918 --> 00:07:21,240
heavy metals are going to be within the

174
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:23,279
AFCO minimums the American Association

175
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:26,220
of plant control

176
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:29,159
plant food control officials gosh that's

177
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:32,160
what it is AFCO it needs to be within

178
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:34,139
their acceptable range so and you it's

179
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,259
listed in many different states you can

180
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:38,579
look up fertilizers and see to say I

181
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:40,919
hear people say things are heavy metal

182
00:07:38,579 --> 00:07:43,318
free it's like almost impossible for

183
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:46,139
that you're gonna you always see some

184
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:49,379
sort of background noise by the time you

185
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:51,300
get to a blended a blended product so

186
00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:53,459
that end product certificate of analysis

187
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:56,340
is super important the other questions

188
00:07:53,459 --> 00:07:58,318
that I would ask would be like ask the

189
00:07:56,339 --> 00:08:01,258
technical support people like what type

190
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:04,860
of grade material do you use because

191
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:07,800
like a good example is potassium nitrate

192
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:10,020
I mean potassium nitrate is a super

193
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,538
important nutrient that's used as a

194
00:08:10,019 --> 00:08:16,139
source of nitrogen and potassium I mean

195
00:08:12,538 --> 00:08:17,939
as a great source of mineral nutrients

196
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:20,160
for plant growth in all different types

197
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:23,219
of situations there are so many

198
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:25,680
different grades of that material like

199
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:27,720
um and it's it's under this umbrella of

200
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,939
technical or Greenhouse grade that's

201
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:33,839
what you should be looking for but even

202
00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:37,679
within that there's like a B's and C's

203
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:39,839
of that that leads to

204
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:42,958
um you know heavy metal content and it

205
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:46,680
also leads to solubility and appearance

206
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:48,659
and that affects pH so you can even see

207
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:50,159
some variation in that so if you could

208
00:08:48,659 --> 00:08:53,219
get some clarification from the

209
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:56,039
manufacturer on what grade of at least

210
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:57,600
the macronutrients that they're using I

211
00:08:56,039 --> 00:09:01,579
would that would give me a big boost of

212
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,580
confidence as a grower I would think

213
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:07,440
cool I think it's not my world so I

214
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:09,180
don't really have a have any comments on

215
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,740
this but um no that's good to hear

216
00:09:09,179 --> 00:09:13,199
because I know there are people that are

217
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:14,700
using mineral salts that listen to the

218
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,778
podcast and I want to make sure we're

219
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,879
not

220
00:09:15,778 --> 00:09:19,439
just talking to organic Growers out

221
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:21,000
there or addressing the concerns of

222
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,519
organic Growers because

223
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,299
it's a science-based podcast

224
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,459
um

225
00:09:24,299 --> 00:09:28,319
moving on though

226
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:30,539
the the main thing that I want to talk

227
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:34,320
to you about was these different methods

228
00:09:30,539 --> 00:09:34,319
of testing specifically

229
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:39,000
tissue testing so I just did a podcast

230
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,680
I'm talking about soil testing with

231
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,740
Bryant Mason who's a wonderful

232
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:46,319
agronomist um and so we really we dove

233
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:48,539
into the Malik 3 the saturated Pace test

234
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,278
and talked about what information on

235
00:09:48,539 --> 00:09:53,039
there and how that applies to soilless

236
00:09:50,278 --> 00:09:55,439
Media but um

237
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:58,740
how does tissue testing play into this

238
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,300
and why did you guys go that route

239
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:02,580
well

240
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:06,599
as a company well the whole company

241
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:09,600
started as this lab and the lab was able

242
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:12,659
to give us connections to Growers and

243
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,940
when we saw the problems that Growers

244
00:10:12,659 --> 00:10:18,600
had that's how my grandfather was able

245
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:21,120
to kind of figure out oh my gosh like I

246
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:24,920
can help them grow by bringing back

247
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:27,899
these blends of mineral

248
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:30,000
nutrients and this was back in the 1940s

249
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:31,740
right so a long time ago when when they

250
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,720
didn't even blend things together and

251
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:37,080
people were just like putting down

252
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:39,899
whatever they want and had no regard for

253
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:41,580
sustainability or or anything really I

254
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:42,419
was just like whatever

255
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:46,139
um

256
00:10:42,419 --> 00:10:48,899
but so we kind of based our whole

257
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:51,240
philosophy and and company Philosophy on

258
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:53,578
this scientific approach and kind of

259
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:58,320
having that connection to data that the

260
00:10:53,578 --> 00:10:59,939
plant can can show us so Mo it all

261
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,640
started in the beginning with soil

262
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:05,399
testing back in the day like true soils

263
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:07,620
with Malik 3 and all of that but as we

264
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:09,778
moved into a fertilizer company in the

265
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:13,200
70s that's when they they really did a

266
00:11:09,778 --> 00:11:15,778
lot of the saturated paste extracts and

267
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,300
tried to understand the connection

268
00:11:15,778 --> 00:11:20,419
between the nutrients that were

269
00:11:18,299 --> 00:11:24,919
immediately available in the root Zone

270
00:11:20,419 --> 00:11:28,019
and then the nutrients that were

271
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:30,599
concentrated in the plant tissues and

272
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:33,539
then taking that information and using

273
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:38,879
database decisions to formulate mineral

274
00:11:33,539 --> 00:11:40,919
blends to kind of optimize plant growth

275
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:43,139
by forming these like nutrient targets

276
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:45,360
so you know like they were then they

277
00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:48,240
were doing a lot of cut flowers so it

278
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:51,480
was like how do we make the best Cut

279
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:54,299
Flower so that it lasts longer and it

280
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:57,180
blooms longer and it it fulfills all of

281
00:11:54,299 --> 00:12:00,059
the you know characteristics of this

282
00:11:57,179 --> 00:12:01,799
Perfection of a Cut Flower and you know

283
00:12:00,059 --> 00:12:03,659
through the years all the different

284
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:08,458
crops that we've worked with from

285
00:12:03,659 --> 00:12:10,980
vegetative animal in annuals to like

286
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:14,699
just regular bedding plants to petunias

287
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:18,000
to Corn soybean cotton I mean you name

288
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:20,339
it we've tested it in the laboratory and

289
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,240
kind of it gave us like this full

290
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:26,940
picture of like what's going on in the

291
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:31,399
plant what's the root seeing and what

292
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:31,399
gets translocated into the plant tissue

293
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:37,019
is there always a correlation between

294
00:12:34,578 --> 00:12:39,239
the saturated paste which is sort of

295
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:40,759
like what is in the media and

296
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,980
immediately available

297
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:46,559
and what is in the plant tissue and is

298
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:48,480
it the same across various crops is that

299
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:49,919
correlation the same across different

300
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,700
crops

301
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:56,819
yeah I mean it's useful to have

302
00:12:53,700 --> 00:13:00,060
a database built where you can have

303
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:01,740
long-term data so because varieties

304
00:13:00,059 --> 00:13:03,778
change and like the varieties like if

305
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:07,079
you take a poinsettia

306
00:13:03,778 --> 00:13:08,879
um varieties from you know the 1940s to

307
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:10,078
something that you see today technically

308
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:13,379
it's still within the thing of

309
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:15,479
poinsettia but it is slightly different

310
00:13:13,379 --> 00:13:17,820
according to these new traits that they

311
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,560
have been breeding for very much similar

312
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:22,019
to the things we're seeing in cannabis

313
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:25,739
you know you're you're dealing with the

314
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:29,459
idea of what the original species that

315
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:31,440
you you had back in the you know 30s 40s

316
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:34,859
50s to the things that are even coming

317
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,980
out you know each year here as we you

318
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:40,440
know Venture into this awesome

319
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:42,240
crop you get to see some of the

320
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:45,600
differences so

321
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:48,959
we've always been able to look at

322
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:52,320
correlations between saturated paste

323
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:54,119
because in in the view of our how we

324
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,459
build nutrient targets the saturated

325
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:59,000
paste extracts gives you a really

326
00:13:56,458 --> 00:14:01,439
great like snapshot on what's

327
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,360
immediately available to the root Zone

328
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,420
it's like the nutrients

329
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:09,180
and and all of the great stuff that's in

330
00:14:06,419 --> 00:14:11,699
the small and large pore spaces of the

331
00:14:09,179 --> 00:14:14,399
of the root Zone and that's what's

332
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:17,639
immediately available to the roots so

333
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:20,399
just saying that that's what should be

334
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:23,278
able to be immediately taken up and

335
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:25,620
translocated in the young healthy root

336
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:28,799
tissue root tips root hairs immediately

337
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:30,980
into the plant up the xylem and should

338
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:34,500
be for a nice healthy functioning plant

339
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:37,019
translocated into the shoots the leaves

340
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:38,940
the growing tissues of the plant that

341
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:41,039
way so yeah we've always seen a

342
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:43,740
correlation between using that

343
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:47,958
information and concentration in leaf

344
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:47,959
tissue for for plant health

345
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,959
oh and I just want to add that watering

346
00:14:52,339 --> 00:14:56,160
environment

347
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:57,599
transpiration all of these things are

348
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:59,458
going to affect how well those nutrients

349
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,120
are taken up but

350
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:04,500
um yeah that makes a lot of sense so so

351
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:06,060
I asked that question because I have

352
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:08,220
heard a couple of people say that tissue

353
00:15:06,059 --> 00:15:11,278
testing doesn't correlate well with soil

354
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:12,660
testing and I I don't believe that to be

355
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:13,980
the case and sounds like what you're

356
00:15:12,659 --> 00:15:15,719
saying is that's

357
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:17,459
there's actually a really strong

358
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,560
correlation there that we can

359
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:21,239
one of the things too though is maybe

360
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:23,698
people say that because you do have to

361
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:26,698
take into a consideration the timing so

362
00:15:23,698 --> 00:15:29,819
what you're seeing immediately in the

363
00:15:26,698 --> 00:15:32,039
in the soilless in in the root Zone you

364
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:34,500
know of the saturated paste

365
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:36,000
isn't going to be exactly what's in the

366
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,220
tissue right now there is like a time

367
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,839
delay so I know people like understand

368
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:43,259
that and they're like oh wait a second

369
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:46,800
so normally we do a tissue test

370
00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:48,419
is what was in in the media like five to

371
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:50,039
seven days ago depending on the crop too

372
00:15:48,419 --> 00:15:51,539
it depends on the crop and the stage and

373
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:53,338
all of that kind of stuff but there is

374
00:15:51,539 --> 00:15:55,698
some sort of time delay that you have to

375
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:55,699
consider

376
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:01,919
okay can you give me a quick like 30

377
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:04,739
second one minute explanation of how

378
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:07,078
what the actual mechanical process is

379
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:08,339
associated with tissue testing like what

380
00:16:07,078 --> 00:16:09,299
you're actually doing when you receive a

381
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:12,420
sample

382
00:16:09,299 --> 00:16:15,838
yep so we do like total concentration

383
00:16:12,419 --> 00:16:17,159
based on Leaf tissue so people send us

384
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,380
you know

385
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:21,539
they send us several different versions

386
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:22,799
of things like healthy tissue that

387
00:16:21,539 --> 00:16:25,679
they're just trying to figure out what's

388
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:28,799
going on and then problematic stuff like

389
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:30,659
burnt deficiencies you name it you know

390
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:33,179
just like not healthy that they're like

391
00:16:30,659 --> 00:16:36,179
holy cow what should I do

392
00:16:33,179 --> 00:16:39,179
um they usually send that in as like a

393
00:16:36,179 --> 00:16:41,099
like fresh tissue so it's wet

394
00:16:39,179 --> 00:16:42,958
um in a paper bag or wrapped in towels

395
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:45,540
or something like that like paper towels

396
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:47,879
and then we dry it overnight

397
00:16:45,539 --> 00:16:50,399
um that is dried at 80 80 degrees

398
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:51,778
Celsius kind of like a dehydrator type

399
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,339
thing you know what I mean just to get

400
00:16:51,778 --> 00:16:56,578
it nice and crunchy and really get it

401
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:58,680
down all the water out and then we grind

402
00:16:56,578 --> 00:17:02,578
that tissue

403
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:05,399
um into like it's not a true powder

404
00:17:02,578 --> 00:17:08,220
but it's like a pretty pretty

405
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:10,740
um small kind of grind that's like 40

406
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:12,360
mesh goes through a 40 mesh screen and

407
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:15,058
then we weigh out a certain amount and

408
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:17,039
then it gets ashed overnight so that

409
00:17:15,058 --> 00:17:20,160
ashing process really just removes the

410
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:22,980
carbon from the sample so so that's you

411
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,600
know the purpose of that and

412
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:26,818
um it gets ashed at for I think it's

413
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:28,798
like four hours at like 450 degrees

414
00:17:26,818 --> 00:17:30,839
Celsius something super high it's done

415
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:33,240
overnight so this is why tissue testing

416
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:34,740
takes 48 hours because there is like the

417
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:38,880
first drying and then the overnight

418
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:42,380
drying and then that after that it gets

419
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:45,900
in our lab the process that we do is um

420
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:48,840
we digest it with a weak acid for 90

421
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:51,900
minutes so that breaks down some of the

422
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:55,259
you know stronger bonds and materials

423
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:57,538
even a little bit more into a solution

424
00:17:55,259 --> 00:17:59,400
and then that gets filtered to remove

425
00:17:57,538 --> 00:18:02,700
some of the bigger debris and stuff and

426
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:05,460
that sample gets run on the ICP

427
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:08,038
um which is super useful

428
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:10,319
um we have an Agilent ICP at our lab

429
00:18:08,038 --> 00:18:13,319
here at Jax and

430
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:15,480
um that basically gives you within 80

431
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:18,839
Seconds a

432
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:20,880
um total nutrient concentration so it

433
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:22,918
doesn't give you nitrogen but it gives

434
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:26,840
you phosphorus potassium calcium

435
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:31,160
magnesium sulfur and all the micros

436
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:31,159
and also silica

437
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:37,760
um aluminum and sodium so and that's how

438
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,759
it's done

439
00:18:39,058 --> 00:18:43,980
very cool and

440
00:18:41,339 --> 00:18:46,918
so I'm seeing more people talking about

441
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:49,079
sap testing

442
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:50,280
can we talk about the differences

443
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:53,220
between

444
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:55,678
tissue testing and sap testing

445
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:57,779
and and why

446
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,280
why you have a preference towards tissue

447
00:18:57,779 --> 00:19:00,599
testing am I using the right term there

448
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:02,700
do we want to call it tissue testing

449
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:04,678
that's what I've always heard yeah I

450
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:08,940
don't know that's what I that's what we

451
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:10,980
call it yeah tissue testing okay

452
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:12,538
if you aren't a plant person then people

453
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:16,640
get confused but if you are they know

454
00:19:12,538 --> 00:19:16,640
what you're talking about like today

455
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:24,240
um yeah I see a lot of people like at at

456
00:19:21,298 --> 00:19:26,819
our company we do tech support

457
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:29,339
um to utilize our products but also to

458
00:19:26,819 --> 00:19:31,619
help Growers

459
00:19:29,339 --> 00:19:33,298
um really get an idea of these nutrient

460
00:19:31,619 --> 00:19:35,579
targets that they're trying to hit and

461
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:39,179
we run into some people that that take

462
00:19:35,579 --> 00:19:41,279
into consideration sap analysis

463
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:44,400
um and

464
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:46,558
at this point you know we we always lean

465
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,140
towards our version of tissue testing

466
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:51,480
because we have such a strong

467
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:53,100
um background in knowledge on how it

468
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,980
relates to the nutrients in the root

469
00:19:53,099 --> 00:19:57,659
Zone and to what's being held in the

470
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:58,919
plant tissue and how to relate that to

471
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:02,400
fertility

472
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:04,740
but you know you do see people

473
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,960
taking a look at sap analysis to try and

474
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:10,140
optimize plant nutrition

475
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:12,720
at a specific time in the plant's life

476
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:14,700
trying to understand can you know can

477
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:18,058
they predict the way nutrients are going

478
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:18,900
to move and is that going to help kind

479
00:20:18,058 --> 00:20:21,660
of

480
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:24,179
allow the crop to hit its Optimum before

481
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:26,220
it's there tissue testing does have the

482
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:27,720
limitation like what we do is you're

483
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:30,720
kind of seeing things that already

484
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,819
happened you know so you can you can

485
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,279
make

486
00:20:31,819 --> 00:20:37,439
really great inferences of knowledge on

487
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:39,720
the nutrition of your plant Health but

488
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,820
it's kind of like looking in the rear

489
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:44,940
view mirror and making choices for the

490
00:20:41,819 --> 00:20:46,980
future from that in the way of plant sap

491
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:49,220
testing people are saying if you could

492
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:52,140
if you can get that information

493
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:54,600
correctly and consistency you might be

494
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:55,799
able to make some database decisions

495
00:20:54,599 --> 00:20:59,939
right away

496
00:20:55,798 --> 00:21:03,660
you know I I have yet to see that work

497
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:06,840
well in a in a successful cannabis

498
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:11,759
cultivation facility that that I've

499
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:13,619
worked with yet but you know I do hear a

500
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:16,038
lot of people are are starting to lean

501
00:21:13,619 --> 00:21:16,038
that way

502
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:21,780
yeah so that so that the two main

503
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:24,240
concerns are one there isn't really an

504
00:21:21,779 --> 00:21:26,940
existing database that would take in all

505
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:30,659
of the information that we would need

506
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:31,860
because it is just a snapshot and then I

507
00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:33,240
guess there's three so then how do we

508
00:21:31,859 --> 00:21:36,439
use that information to make a

509
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:39,000
data-driven decision moving forward

510
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:40,440
and then and then lastly I would think

511
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,380
we would have to test

512
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:45,600
quite frequently because that value is

513
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:47,280
constantly changing

514
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:50,819
yeah

515
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:53,099
yeah you would think so I mean the in

516
00:21:50,819 --> 00:21:55,678
the cytosol which is the water inside

517
00:21:53,099 --> 00:21:58,199
the cell the sap right that's what they

518
00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:01,798
you want to try and get a an idea of

519
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:04,140
what that is plant cells are different

520
00:22:01,798 --> 00:22:06,839
they have also

521
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:08,059
juice or water sap inside of the cell

522
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:10,678
wall

523
00:22:08,058 --> 00:22:13,019
so in order to make good database

524
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:16,860
decisions I would think you really also

525
00:22:13,019 --> 00:22:18,720
have to pay attention to how the

526
00:22:16,859 --> 00:22:20,359
extraction procedure for the sap

527
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,759
analysis is too

528
00:22:20,359 --> 00:22:26,819
because you really would not want to get

529
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:29,640
the the sap that's in the cell wall

530
00:22:26,819 --> 00:22:32,339
because that's not movable

531
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:34,259
you know water of nutrients sugars all

532
00:22:32,339 --> 00:22:36,359
the other great stuff in there that we

533
00:22:34,259 --> 00:22:39,839
want to consider we really only want to

534
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:40,558
consider you know the the cytosol

535
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:41,899
um

536
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:45,599
and

537
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:47,940
it's hard to know how the labs do this

538
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:51,298
we actually look at looked at it several

539
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:54,419
times here at Jr Peters and you know the

540
00:22:51,298 --> 00:22:57,480
the extraction process is something that

541
00:22:54,419 --> 00:23:00,659
can be compromised very easily and then

542
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:02,279
then you have data but what is that data

543
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:05,580
going to give you you know it could be

544
00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:07,798
misleading in that it's not

545
00:23:05,579 --> 00:23:09,960
really giving you the right information

546
00:23:07,798 --> 00:23:12,119
that you need to make a decision but

547
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:13,919
you're making a decision on it and is

548
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:18,298
that the decision going to be the right

549
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:21,059
one so it just hasn't been

550
00:23:18,298 --> 00:23:24,599
it just hasn't been around long enough

551
00:23:21,058 --> 00:23:26,460
to do some Perfection but I mean people

552
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:27,899
definitely argue this point with me all

553
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:29,880
the time

554
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:32,960
so I'm sure people will hear this and be

555
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,960
like Oh Carrie

556
00:23:33,558 --> 00:23:38,759
So when you say cytosol is that

557
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:39,960
essentially the the cytoplasm is that

558
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:42,240
the same thing or is it something

559
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:45,240
different

560
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,240
okay

561
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:52,500
yes

562
00:23:49,859 --> 00:23:54,959
it's the it's the water inside the cell

563
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:58,558
the water consisting of water nutrients

564
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:01,019
sugars organic acids I mean amino acids

565
00:23:58,558 --> 00:24:02,579
there's even like remnants of enzymes in

566
00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:04,859
there and those enzymes are the things

567
00:24:02,579 --> 00:24:07,139
that catalyze those the reactions like

568
00:24:04,859 --> 00:24:10,558
photosynthesis like there's a lot going

569
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:13,200
on in there besides just nutrients you

570
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:16,759
know it's like everything that makes the

571
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,759
cell go in liquid form

572
00:24:17,099 --> 00:24:22,918
so so this is a question for I think

573
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:24,780
tissue testing or sap testing

574
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:27,179
um Mobile versus immobile nutrients

575
00:24:24,779 --> 00:24:30,480
where are you sampling on the plant and

576
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:33,480
how does that impact your results

577
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:36,419
for either case where you sample on the

578
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:40,079
plants extremely important for what we

579
00:24:36,419 --> 00:24:43,620
do in tissue testing we recommend

580
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:46,558
getting a the the leaf that's most

581
00:24:43,619 --> 00:24:50,339
useful is one that is most recently

582
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:52,918
mature so when you're trying to see the

583
00:24:50,339 --> 00:24:55,918
state of health current health of your

584
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:58,559
plant you want to recently mature tissue

585
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:00,780
so not the oldest one not the newest one

586
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:02,700
the one that's basically just reached

587
00:25:00,779 --> 00:25:04,558
its maturity and that's what you're

588
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:06,659
looking for

589
00:25:04,558 --> 00:25:09,480
um and then if you're having a problem

590
00:25:06,659 --> 00:25:11,340
situation or you see like obvious

591
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:13,200
deficiency or something then you sample

592
00:25:11,339 --> 00:25:15,359
from those parts but if you're just

593
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:18,659
really trying to get the like best

594
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:21,479
status of of your plant's Health it's

595
00:25:18,659 --> 00:25:23,280
the recently mature tissue that exact

596
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:25,558
same

597
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:27,139
um thought process would apply to sap

598
00:25:25,558 --> 00:25:32,038
testing

599
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:35,038
you could make an argument that if you

600
00:25:32,038 --> 00:25:37,798
would take more of the tissue from the

601
00:25:35,038 --> 00:25:40,519
newest leaves the Mary stems the flowers

602
00:25:37,798 --> 00:25:44,339
you're going to get some

603
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:46,619
nutrient data that's showing movement

604
00:25:44,339 --> 00:25:48,418
through the plants phloem which is a

605
00:25:46,619 --> 00:25:50,459
different method than if you would take

606
00:25:48,419 --> 00:25:53,820
it from older leaves or several

607
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:56,819
different leaves in the plant that is

608
00:25:53,819 --> 00:25:57,859
mostly xylem Fed so like normally when

609
00:25:56,819 --> 00:25:59,939
you bring

610
00:25:57,859 --> 00:26:03,839
nutrients and water into the plant it

611
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:05,400
goes Roots xylem into leaves and then to

612
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:07,740
move it around the leaves it moves

613
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:09,720
through the phloem but

614
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:11,339
um you know not everything moves through

615
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:15,120
the phloem and that's when you get into

616
00:26:11,339 --> 00:26:18,000
Mobile versus immobile elements but you

617
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:21,739
can tell both of them from Total tissue

618
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,740
testing and sap analysis

619
00:26:22,259 --> 00:26:25,619
okay okay

620
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,679
um

621
00:26:25,619 --> 00:26:30,439
great I so it's a lot of picturing there

622
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:32,880
is

623
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:34,740
well my brain was jumping around because

624
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,360
whenever I hear the word flow I'm now I

625
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:38,099
remember from my botany class that my

626
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:40,019
professor was like phloem equals food

627
00:26:38,099 --> 00:26:40,819
and so I have that like equation stuff

628
00:26:40,019 --> 00:26:43,980
yeah

629
00:26:40,819 --> 00:26:46,200
fake equation but no what I was going to

630
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:48,720
ask about was I was picturing so

631
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,880
from like in like grower terms the

632
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,579
larger the most

633
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:56,278
that the fan Leaf that's like

634
00:26:53,579 --> 00:26:58,439
highest to the top that's the same size

635
00:26:56,278 --> 00:27:00,960
as your other fan leaves

636
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:02,220
um so it's fully mature so you're not

637
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,360
talking about the top of the plant we're

638
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:05,640
not talking about the bottom of the

639
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:07,558
plants somewhere kind of in the yep I'm

640
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:09,000
guessing middle to the upper third of

641
00:27:07,558 --> 00:27:11,879
the plant that you get that like fully

642
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,579
mature Leaf is that yep that's like your

643
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:17,100
sweet spot yes yeah that that is

644
00:27:14,579 --> 00:27:19,199
definitely your sweet spot for tissue

645
00:27:17,099 --> 00:27:20,639
testing in cannabis

646
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,580
and that's where when you see some

647
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:26,580
ranges from places you'll see

648
00:27:23,579 --> 00:27:28,500
if they don't kind of say okay this is

649
00:27:26,579 --> 00:27:30,720
New Growth or old growth and they're

650
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:32,640
just giving you ranges it's always from

651
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:37,159
that typical area of the plant

652
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:37,159
regardless of the species or variety

653
00:27:37,798 --> 00:27:43,679
okay so I'm I'm a grower I'm thinking

654
00:27:40,619 --> 00:27:45,658
about tissue testing or just doing more

655
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:49,798
testing in general

656
00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:52,140
how affordable is it and then how useful

657
00:27:49,798 --> 00:27:53,940
is that data

658
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:56,038
like let's say

659
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:58,558
well I guess first tackle that first

660
00:27:56,038 --> 00:28:02,278
question of affordability

661
00:27:58,558 --> 00:28:06,000
yeah at what point does it make sense

662
00:28:02,278 --> 00:28:09,538
so we you know we are a full production

663
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,400
Horticulture lab we get between

664
00:28:09,538 --> 00:28:14,519
I mean December and January are one of

665
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:16,200
our slowest because the end of December

666
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:18,778
I think people are just enjoying life

667
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:20,400
with the holidays and then back at it in

668
00:28:18,778 --> 00:28:22,019
January

669
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:25,798
um at that time we're getting like a

670
00:28:22,019 --> 00:28:27,720
hundred samples a day but in the

671
00:28:25,798 --> 00:28:30,240
the thick of it all like depending on

672
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:32,880
Seasons um but getting into like spring

673
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:35,640
you know typical spring will get up to

674
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:39,659
250 a day

675
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:43,799
um for us the sample is 46 dollars

676
00:28:39,659 --> 00:28:45,179
um for each sample for tissue testing

677
00:28:43,798 --> 00:28:46,918
and

678
00:28:45,179 --> 00:28:48,600
um I always say and that price has gone

679
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:50,340
up over time like when I started I think

680
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:51,839
it was yeah I've been with my I've been

681
00:28:50,339 --> 00:28:53,658
actually getting paid by my parents

682
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:57,119
since 2004.

683
00:28:53,659 --> 00:29:00,539
but you know I've worked there forever

684
00:28:57,119 --> 00:29:03,119
um but back then it was like 30.

685
00:29:00,538 --> 00:29:05,400
and now it's 46 and um

686
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:07,259
but I remember saying like oh yeah it's

687
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:09,960
the best 46 dollars you're all you'll

688
00:29:07,259 --> 00:29:12,179
ever spend to get your before you start

689
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:15,058
for like before you start growing a crop

690
00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:19,440
is to do a media test just a saturated

691
00:29:15,058 --> 00:29:22,019
paste to make sure your your cocoa or

692
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,340
um your living soil or any combination

693
00:29:22,019 --> 00:29:26,038
of the things that you're trying to put

694
00:29:23,339 --> 00:29:28,079
together is making sense and is hitting

695
00:29:26,038 --> 00:29:31,079
what you want to and then we see this

696
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:34,079
with cocoa all the time I mean so many

697
00:29:31,079 --> 00:29:37,079
people get burned with like cocoa that

698
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:39,480
isn't rinsed so you have a ton of

699
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:41,220
potassium and chloride in there

700
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:43,140
um but if you would do that 46 dollar

701
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:45,659
media test you'd figure that out in a

702
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:48,600
second super easy to remedy but you have

703
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:50,700
to remedy it if you put if you put um

704
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:53,759
your your clones in there they'll burn

705
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:56,159
up in a matter of hours

706
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:57,839
um so we always say like that 46 dollars

707
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:00,899
is the best crop insurance you'll ever

708
00:29:57,839 --> 00:30:03,359
find the the thing with tissue testing

709
00:30:00,898 --> 00:30:05,879
is you have to be ready to look at the

710
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:08,038
data I mean I and and I don't know I

711
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:09,600
guess I'm just one of those people like

712
00:30:08,038 --> 00:30:12,179
let's just not

713
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:15,538
sample to collect data and never look at

714
00:30:12,179 --> 00:30:18,480
it let's try and figure out a nutrient

715
00:30:15,538 --> 00:30:21,058
Management program that has timed

716
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:24,240
testing to points where decisions need

717
00:30:21,058 --> 00:30:26,639
to be made so you know for cannabis

718
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,140
obviously they're they're knowing what

719
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,778
you're starting with boom that's super

720
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:34,259
important but then taking some samples

721
00:30:30,778 --> 00:30:36,720
at each stage of growth before you're

722
00:30:34,259 --> 00:30:39,179
making any adjustments or changing your

723
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:42,538
watering practices or your environmental

724
00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:45,179
conditions or your light levels take

725
00:30:42,538 --> 00:30:46,919
some smart data points there so you can

726
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:49,559
see what you're starting see where the

727
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:52,440
plant is before you made that change and

728
00:30:49,558 --> 00:30:54,418
then two weeks after that change so

729
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:57,058
really at the end of the day for people

730
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:59,700
that we are really helping establish

731
00:30:57,058 --> 00:31:04,079
their own nutrient Target it might be

732
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:04,798
10 samples over the crop cycle

733
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:07,379
um

734
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:10,500
at the most and then when they have

735
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:14,460
their data kind of dialed in it can be

736
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:15,898
down to like four samples based on how

737
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:18,659
much effort they want to put into

738
00:31:15,898 --> 00:31:19,319
looking at the data

739
00:31:18,659 --> 00:31:24,179
um

740
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:25,798
so okay it's not overwhelming at 500.

741
00:31:24,179 --> 00:31:27,720
yeah

742
00:31:25,798 --> 00:31:29,700
all right I think because that at least

743
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:31,860
gives people an idea of the cost and

744
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:35,278
then so let's say I get a test result

745
00:31:31,859 --> 00:31:37,740
back on my

746
00:31:35,278 --> 00:31:42,119
tissue testing and and we discover that

747
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:45,179
it is low in pick your nutrient uh

748
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:46,678
so many things potassium yeah let's say

749
00:31:45,179 --> 00:31:48,298
potassium

750
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:51,059
um just because that's a fairly easy one

751
00:31:48,298 --> 00:31:54,119
from the organic side so let's say your

752
00:31:51,058 --> 00:31:56,158
your tissue shows low in potassium what

753
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:57,898
do you what do you do and how do I know

754
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,460
it's low in potassium like when I get

755
00:31:57,898 --> 00:32:01,319
that result back from you is it gonna

756
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:04,500
have some

757
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:06,359
targets or or what does that look like

758
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:10,319
yeah I mean I don't know if every lab

759
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:13,678
does our lab has normal ranges

760
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:16,200
um that we provide and that's based on

761
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:18,179
rolling data that we collect here from

762
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:22,019
the samples that are sent in that we do

763
00:32:18,179 --> 00:32:22,679
data based kind of analysis over time

764
00:32:22,019 --> 00:32:26,158
um

765
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:29,640
and yeah it'll say oh this is outside

766
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:32,820
the normal limit or it's low or we have

767
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:34,919
a tech support team so people normally

768
00:32:32,819 --> 00:32:36,839
when they get their result they'll give

769
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:38,179
us a ring and be like hey do you want to

770
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:41,398
talk about my results

771
00:32:38,179 --> 00:32:44,278
and we say yes that's what we do and

772
00:32:41,398 --> 00:32:45,898
then one of our tech support team you

773
00:32:44,278 --> 00:32:49,558
know basically talks it through like

774
00:32:45,898 --> 00:32:51,898
okay why this is low why is that is it

775
00:32:49,558 --> 00:32:54,119
something I should be concerned about we

776
00:32:51,898 --> 00:32:55,859
spend a lot of time which I'm sure you

777
00:32:54,119 --> 00:32:59,038
do Tad too because this is what it's all

778
00:32:55,859 --> 00:33:02,519
about is looking at ratios like is this

779
00:32:59,038 --> 00:33:04,379
balanced if I make a change in a

780
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:06,418
potassium source to increase potassium

781
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:09,179
is that going to throw something off

782
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:11,278
that I don't want it to so it's a

783
00:33:09,179 --> 00:33:13,140
conversation

784
00:33:11,278 --> 00:33:16,019
um just getting the results and looking

785
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:17,519
at them and going oh yeah I'm not sure

786
00:33:16,019 --> 00:33:19,339
what does that mean then you just

787
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:22,079
totally wasted your time and money

788
00:33:19,339 --> 00:33:24,599
pretty much you know you have to be able

789
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:28,319
to look at it and say

790
00:33:24,599 --> 00:33:30,298
all right this because of this I choose

791
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:32,519
to do this we see it a lot with people

792
00:33:30,298 --> 00:33:34,619
that have problems too it's like

793
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:35,940
they'll and this is more like we'll take

794
00:33:34,619 --> 00:33:38,219
a

795
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:41,100
um I don't know a petunia grower growing

796
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:43,620
like a billion Flats of Petunias right

797
00:33:41,099 --> 00:33:45,778
and they're coming back yellow

798
00:33:43,619 --> 00:33:49,558
so the grower will send all our things

799
00:33:45,778 --> 00:33:52,019
and then I get the tests back and and we

800
00:33:49,558 --> 00:33:54,379
say okay let's help and maybe it's you

801
00:33:52,019 --> 00:33:57,000
know the pH is too high so it's iron

802
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:58,380
deficient and that's why they're pale in

803
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,839
the new growth so I'll talk to the

804
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:03,059
grower and go okay well this is what we

805
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:05,418
see and then they'll go oh man

806
00:34:03,058 --> 00:34:08,460
well I already leeched

807
00:34:05,419 --> 00:34:11,338
and I already did this and I already did

808
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:13,980
that so again you missed the opportunity

809
00:34:11,338 --> 00:34:18,000
to make a database decision and you

810
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:19,679
already did things to switch the switch

811
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,139
the scenario

812
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:24,119
so it's hard it's you know especially

813
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:25,858
with a high value crop of cannabis it's

814
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:27,659
like the last thing you want to do is be

815
00:34:25,858 --> 00:34:30,299
like let's see something starting and

816
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:32,460
then have to wait so choosing a lab that

817
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:34,679
can get you the results quick is is very

818
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:37,940
important for your sanity and your

819
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:40,320
non-gray hairs but also being able to

820
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:42,780
utilize the data and go oh my gosh okay

821
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:45,300
so I would have never expected this

822
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:47,580
result how do I fix it and having

823
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:49,379
someone to sit talk it through with you

824
00:34:47,579 --> 00:34:51,000
and make some recommendations is is

825
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:52,618
really the key

826
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,418
and you don't have to pay a consultant

827
00:34:52,619 --> 00:34:58,140
to do that like people should do this

828
00:34:54,418 --> 00:35:00,420
for you that make products I know you do

829
00:34:58,139 --> 00:35:02,879
and I know we do and I know a lot of

830
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:04,920
other companies out there do too and

831
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:07,260
that's what the cool thing about being

832
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:10,139
in cultivation of any plant is we're all

833
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:11,720
here to work together and sometimes that

834
00:35:10,139 --> 00:35:14,400
doesn't happen and there's more like

835
00:35:11,719 --> 00:35:16,919
competition and this and that and the

836
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:19,200
other when in reality growing plants

837
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:21,420
should be a community of love

838
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:23,338
[Laughter]

839
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:24,780
I love the idea about it I don't know

840
00:35:23,338 --> 00:35:27,838
that it works out that way in practice

841
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:28,859
but I love the idea it doesn't always

842
00:35:27,838 --> 00:35:32,159
yes

843
00:35:28,858 --> 00:35:34,739
but yes I like you I love it when people

844
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:37,078
reach out because we want to work with

845
00:35:34,739 --> 00:35:38,639
them and I want to know before they do

846
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:40,380
applications of things because the

847
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:42,900
hardest thing like you said is when they

848
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:44,640
see a problem

849
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:46,740
you talk about the problem and then you

850
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:48,358
find out they already done everything

851
00:35:46,739 --> 00:35:49,559
because because when I when I see a

852
00:35:48,358 --> 00:35:51,960
problem the first thing I want to do is

853
00:35:49,559 --> 00:35:54,420
reduce the number of variables in my

854
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:56,400
garden because then it allows me to

855
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:58,800
figure out what that mechanism is that's

856
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,119
causing the problem and like when we

857
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,440
were talking about potassium back there

858
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:03,960
my first thought was oh it's low

859
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:06,659
potassium well maybe we have a watering

860
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:08,760
issue that's leeching out more potassium

861
00:36:06,659 --> 00:36:10,618
than we want out of that soil so

862
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:12,300
that conversation I think can be really

863
00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:13,920
helpful and we're not testing just for

864
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:16,500
the sake of testing like we want to make

865
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:19,200
sure that that testing is productive and

866
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:21,599
allows us to make a data-driven decision

867
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:23,460
like you said in our garden ultimately

868
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:25,320
because that's the whole reason we test

869
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:27,420
and not everyone can afford to test you

870
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:29,280
know if if you have a small garden of 10

871
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:31,740
plants five plants or a vegetable garden

872
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:34,200
for example it may not be practical to

873
00:36:31,739 --> 00:36:36,299
do a bunch of tissue testing

874
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:38,159
um no so there's other there's other

875
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:40,500
tools visual tools that we'll use in

876
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:42,899
that case or maybe you know you have a

877
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:44,519
you have a pH meter a good pH meter or a

878
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:46,380
way to test your EC so there's other

879
00:36:44,519 --> 00:36:48,000
other forms of testing that don't

880
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:49,140
involve lab analysis that's not going to

881
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,858
give you

882
00:36:49,139 --> 00:36:54,480
the same Precision of information but at

883
00:36:52,858 --> 00:36:56,759
least they're all tools that we can use

884
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:59,400
I guess as a gardener

885
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:02,640
oh yeah and I feel like if you don't if

886
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:06,300
you discount any of that the visual

887
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:10,019
Factor the environmental Factor the the

888
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:12,420
whole picture you're really selling

889
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:13,980
yourself short on how to grow an Optimum

890
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:17,579
plant I mean I think of this all the

891
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:19,559
time like now that I have um I use Waze

892
00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:21,780
on my phone you know that like that you

893
00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:23,338
know to get around ways

894
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:26,099
um like Google Maps or whatever when I

895
00:37:23,338 --> 00:37:28,380
drive around I'm telling you if that app

896
00:37:26,099 --> 00:37:31,079
ever doesn't work I cannot figure out

897
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:33,059
how to go anywhere and I used to be able

898
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:35,820
to be really good at being like okay I

899
00:37:33,059 --> 00:37:37,679
make a left over by that church you know

900
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:39,660
and go back this way and know the

901
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:42,199
landscape and I kind of think of that

902
00:37:39,659 --> 00:37:46,319
all the time when I look at people that

903
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:49,559
really dive into so much

904
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:52,320
um specific nutrient information and and

905
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:56,400
don't take into account the whole system

906
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:58,800
as a whole and how it works together so

907
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:01,200
I do feel like tissue media water

908
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:04,500
nutrient testing as a whole is really

909
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:07,319
useful but if you're not really plugged

910
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:09,719
into your whole growing environment and

911
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:13,079
everything together it's not going to

912
00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:15,959
work into helping you grow your Optimum

913
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:19,160
plan it just isn't it's it's all kind of

914
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:19,159
pieces to a puzzle

915
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:24,659
I I say this every podcast and I'm just

916
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:27,240
gonna say it again so maybe it'll just

917
00:38:24,659 --> 00:38:30,000
get drilled in everyone's head the the

918
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:31,739
way to approach a garden or a plant is

919
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,780
to look at what as a detective what's

920
00:38:31,739 --> 00:38:35,519
the limiting factor of growth and

921
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:37,380
everyone blames the nutrients as you

922
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:40,980
know they blame the media they blame the

923
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:44,940
soil but if you're if your light levels

924
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:46,380
are 500 ppfd in flour it's probably not

925
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:48,960
your nutrient program that's causing

926
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:51,960
your problem you know if your VPD is way

927
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:53,880
off uh as as Nadia will tell us then it

928
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:57,000
doesn't really matter because your plant

929
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:59,400
can't translocate that calcium that it

930
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,679
may need effectively if you have a

931
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,400
massive pest issue as Suzanne talks

932
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:04,799
about

933
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:07,200
um those things can all of these things

934
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:10,859
can create plant stress and manifest as

935
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:13,078
nutrient deficiencies or toxicities so

936
00:39:10,858 --> 00:39:14,460
you really do have to be a detective and

937
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:16,200
I can't tell you how many conversations

938
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:21,539
I've had with commercial cultivators

939
00:39:16,199 --> 00:39:23,578
where we talk about their grow and they

940
00:39:21,539 --> 00:39:25,079
've not intentionally but they'll omit

941
00:39:23,579 --> 00:39:26,880
information they'll forget things that

942
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:30,539
happened oh yeah our gardener applied

943
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:32,820
this or oh yeah we've also had a massive

944
00:39:30,539 --> 00:39:34,679
spider mite infestation like and these

945
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:36,119
sorts of things are important data

946
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:38,219
points to be aware of when we're really

947
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:39,720
trying to look at the plant holistically

948
00:39:38,219 --> 00:39:43,919
like you talked about

949
00:39:39,719 --> 00:39:45,419
yeah at Jax I mean the people that do

950
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,920
tech support are tech support team

951
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:48,420
people that were here and people that

952
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:51,180
were here in the past and moved on to

953
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:53,400
other positions they always say that the

954
00:39:51,179 --> 00:39:56,399
most fun is talking to people and being

955
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:58,039
that little sleuth you know trying to

956
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:02,220
figure out like

957
00:39:58,039 --> 00:40:04,619
what could be the issue or how can we

958
00:40:02,219 --> 00:40:07,858
tweak this just a little bit to hit it

959
00:40:04,619 --> 00:40:09,838
perfectly and it's a lot of fun

960
00:40:07,858 --> 00:40:11,699
um and the background and people ask all

961
00:40:09,838 --> 00:40:14,279
the time like how do you get into

962
00:40:11,699 --> 00:40:17,098
knowing this type of stuff I mean I got

963
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:19,500
my PhD and well my Master's in soil

964
00:40:17,099 --> 00:40:22,079
science so I learned Agronomy you know

965
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:25,440
from that side of it and then went into

966
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:28,619
Plant Nutrition but you know you really

967
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:30,659
just have to have like a love for like

968
00:40:28,619 --> 00:40:33,539
science and there's a lot of chemistry

969
00:40:30,659 --> 00:40:37,379
involved but a lot of it's investigative

970
00:40:33,539 --> 00:40:39,719
reporting so we need more of these

971
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:41,700
inquisitive Minds to join tech support

972
00:40:39,719 --> 00:40:44,159
for people because

973
00:40:41,699 --> 00:40:47,098
um it's it's fun and there is a huge

974
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:48,838
need for knowledgeable individuals that

975
00:40:47,099 --> 00:40:51,119
aren't out there to like

976
00:40:48,838 --> 00:40:53,219
make a buck for themselves and just help

977
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:56,099
you know and that's that's what we're

978
00:40:53,219 --> 00:40:59,059
about here at Jax even though we do make

979
00:40:56,099 --> 00:40:59,059
a lot of fertilizer

980
00:40:59,099 --> 00:41:04,079
yeah and I think that's why

981
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:06,119
um you can't really diagnose a problem

982
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:08,780
from a photo

983
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:10,980
um yeah it's a deeper conversation

984
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:13,920
obviously it's better if it's you know

985
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:15,719
accompanied by some some test results uh

986
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,159
but we need that holistic picture to

987
00:41:15,719 --> 00:41:18,659
really make a determination what's going

988
00:41:17,159 --> 00:41:21,059
on with that plant

989
00:41:18,659 --> 00:41:22,858
um these people that you know and I do

990
00:41:21,059 --> 00:41:25,578
this on my Instagram I'll post photos I

991
00:41:22,858 --> 00:41:25,578
I hope people

992
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:32,400
but more just a way to get your brain

993
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:33,420
thinking about like what could be a

994
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,760
possible

995
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:38,579
source of this rather than what the

996
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:40,560
definitive answer is I guess so yeah I I

997
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:42,060
enjoy it you know I think it's it's it's

998
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:45,179
fun it all started with one with wind

999
00:41:42,059 --> 00:41:47,519
burn that uh Nadia explained related to

1000
00:41:45,179 --> 00:41:49,440
transpiration and calcium movement which

1001
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:51,539
I thought was a really fascinating

1002
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,200
plant physiology answer

1003
00:41:51,539 --> 00:41:54,000
um

1004
00:41:52,199 --> 00:41:55,618
so yeah that's been a fun thing but it's

1005
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,280
not really a diagnostic tool so that's

1006
00:41:55,619 --> 00:42:00,720
where testing comes in and uh for our

1007
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,460
company because tissue testing

1008
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:04,618
traditionally hasn't been available to

1009
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:08,039
the Cannabis Community we've done a lot

1010
00:42:04,619 --> 00:42:10,380
of our recommendations based off of the

1011
00:42:08,039 --> 00:42:12,059
saturated paste and the Malik 3 and

1012
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:14,220
we've had good success with that I love

1013
00:42:12,059 --> 00:42:16,440
the idea though of adding in tissue

1014
00:42:14,219 --> 00:42:18,239
testing where where people can do that

1015
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:19,679
and I think there's a lot that I'm

1016
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:21,059
excited to learn around that side of

1017
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:23,699
things too

1018
00:42:21,059 --> 00:42:26,880
yeah and it's really useful that

1019
00:42:23,699 --> 00:42:29,460
universities have been able to you know

1020
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:31,680
do what they are able to do now in in

1021
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:34,740
their research settings which isn't

1022
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:38,460
always like 100 applicable to like

1023
00:42:34,739 --> 00:42:41,399
actual like each Growers is different

1024
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:45,059
but still being able to publish these

1025
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:47,760
studies that have been you know repeated

1026
00:42:45,059 --> 00:42:50,099
and validated it's going to be really

1027
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:52,140
really good for the community to be able

1028
00:42:50,099 --> 00:42:54,780
to get true

1029
00:42:52,139 --> 00:42:56,460
um verified data so every single year

1030
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:58,500
you see all these researchers coming out

1031
00:42:56,460 --> 00:43:00,780
with fabulous things and I'm just blown

1032
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:03,179
away with the science behind it so

1033
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:05,940
that's it's gonna every like I said it's

1034
00:43:03,179 --> 00:43:07,618
just getting better and better

1035
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:09,780
yeah so when we talk about tissue

1036
00:43:07,619 --> 00:43:11,460
testing how much you know you said

1037
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:13,920
you're giving a range how much

1038
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:16,980
variability based on genetics within

1039
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:18,119
cannabis do you see on these tissue

1040
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:19,619
tests because I think that's another

1041
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:20,760
thing that we should probably talk about

1042
00:43:19,619 --> 00:43:23,519
a little bit

1043
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:27,180
yeah that information for us is hard

1044
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:29,519
because we don't always have

1045
00:43:27,179 --> 00:43:32,639
like when we talk about customers

1046
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:35,639
sending in samples to us we don't

1047
00:43:32,639 --> 00:43:38,338
have the information specific to that

1048
00:43:35,639 --> 00:43:39,900
unless we're setting up research trials

1049
00:43:38,338 --> 00:43:43,199
that we're collecting that information

1050
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:44,940
you know what I mean so if a if a grower

1051
00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:46,559
just wants to get data for themselves

1052
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:48,838
they're going to be calling their sample

1053
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:50,420
names whatever it is and we won't have

1054
00:43:48,838 --> 00:43:54,599
any idea

1055
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:58,740
what it is or what genetics or

1056
00:43:54,599 --> 00:44:02,940
much besides you know lumping it into

1057
00:43:58,739 --> 00:44:05,279
this General thing of cannabis so

1058
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:07,679
um yeah it's hard it's hard to make

1059
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:08,519
comments on the variability because we

1060
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:10,618
really

1061
00:44:08,519 --> 00:44:14,119
can only do what we do with the samples

1062
00:44:10,619 --> 00:44:14,119
that we get here at Jr Peters

1063
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,380
so as a grower

1064
00:44:16,858 --> 00:44:20,940
I'm just thinking out loud here we

1065
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:23,160
probably wanted

1066
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:25,019
to dial in some of our cultivars over

1067
00:44:23,159 --> 00:44:27,299
time like as we take these data points

1068
00:44:25,019 --> 00:44:28,920
and say this is a this is the this is

1069
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:30,960
the reason we test with healthy plants

1070
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:32,880
is so if we have like a Target then we

1071
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:35,039
can say this plant is just vigorous it's

1072
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,780
healthy it yielded really well we'll

1073
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:39,300
call this my target for this particular

1074
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:41,460
cultivar and then we try and replicate

1075
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:43,980
that essentially close to that Target

1076
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:45,780
that's what we do approach it yeah

1077
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:48,559
that's what we do with Growers so

1078
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:50,880
they'll you know they have their

1079
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:53,519
phenotypes that they're trying to figure

1080
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:55,140
out and then they're like

1081
00:44:53,519 --> 00:44:58,858
um varieties that are just like their

1082
00:44:55,139 --> 00:45:01,318
number ones so we'll dial in that to

1083
00:44:58,858 --> 00:45:03,358
you know try and establish nutrient

1084
00:45:01,318 --> 00:45:04,858
targets to hit

1085
00:45:03,358 --> 00:45:08,759
um and the variability when we do

1086
00:45:04,858 --> 00:45:10,559
something like that still can be

1087
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:12,780
a lot like

1088
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:15,000
I mean I was just working with a grower

1089
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:16,500
I can't even remember like I don't even

1090
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
know if I should say that what it is but

1091
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:22,500
hey um

1092
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:24,900
the calcium concentration over time was

1093
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:27,420
so variable and I've seen this quite a

1094
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:29,818
bit in in cannabis that there's been

1095
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:32,519
many many situations of like almost like

1096
00:45:29,818 --> 00:45:34,559
hyper accumulation of calcium in the

1097
00:45:32,519 --> 00:45:36,539
leaf tissue which is just like

1098
00:45:34,559 --> 00:45:40,380
unbelievable because you don't expect

1099
00:45:36,539 --> 00:45:44,400
that but even within like targeted and

1100
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:47,579
many many crop cycles of of repetition

1101
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:51,059
we still see variability from for these

1102
00:45:47,579 --> 00:45:52,880
secondary nutrients most NP and K are

1103
00:45:51,059 --> 00:45:56,699
pretty consistent from what I've seen

1104
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:59,160
micronutrients they're less variable but

1105
00:45:56,699 --> 00:46:00,659
they still can vary slightly but it's in

1106
00:45:59,159 --> 00:46:02,338
the secondary nutrients calcium

1107
00:46:00,659 --> 00:46:05,219
magnesium and sulfur that we see the

1108
00:46:02,338 --> 00:46:06,779
most like swings Within These data

1109
00:46:05,219 --> 00:46:07,559
points

1110
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:09,720
um

1111
00:46:07,559 --> 00:46:12,420
and again it's just watching it over

1112
00:46:09,719 --> 00:46:13,858
time because these are healthy plants

1113
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:16,260
that are hitting their yields and

1114
00:46:13,858 --> 00:46:18,239
hitting every single thing they want to

1115
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:20,760
do and the grower is just trying to

1116
00:46:18,239 --> 00:46:22,199
figure out how to repeat that again you

1117
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:24,599
know

1118
00:46:22,199 --> 00:46:29,118
okay so you see variability in healthy

1119
00:46:24,599 --> 00:46:29,119
tissue too yep oh yeah interesting

1120
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:33,960
so so that makes me competition just

1121
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:35,399
like sorry one little aside to that that

1122
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:37,920
makes me think like when I work with

1123
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:41,358
Growers that are like I would like to

1124
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:46,639
hit magnesium in solution at

1125
00:46:41,358 --> 00:46:48,719
23.75 parts per million I'm like well

1126
00:46:46,639 --> 00:46:51,358
you really don't have to do that let's

1127
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:53,399
do between 20 and 25 and you're good you

1128
00:46:51,358 --> 00:46:54,779
know

1129
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:56,059
um you know because

1130
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:58,740
yeah

1131
00:46:56,059 --> 00:47:01,500
sorry I didn't mean to cut you off

1132
00:46:58,739 --> 00:47:03,838
no no that's good that's good uh I had

1133
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:06,358
one last tissue testing question before

1134
00:47:03,838 --> 00:47:08,940
moving on to another topic here and that

1135
00:47:06,358 --> 00:47:10,799
was getting back to that hypothetical of

1136
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:12,300
that tissue test that showed low

1137
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:16,560
potassium

1138
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:20,818
how do we approach that in a organic

1139
00:47:16,559 --> 00:47:22,440
versus a hybrid versus uh mineral salt

1140
00:47:20,818 --> 00:47:24,539
program

1141
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:26,280
because that I I assume they would be

1142
00:47:24,539 --> 00:47:28,619
different because in my head I'm

1143
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:30,420
thinking okay as an organic grower

1144
00:47:28,619 --> 00:47:32,640
I know there's more potassium

1145
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:34,858
potentially coming down the line

1146
00:47:32,639 --> 00:47:37,259
from my Malik test whereas if I'm

1147
00:47:34,858 --> 00:47:40,139
growing in Cocoa with mineral salts I

1148
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:41,760
would think or in Hydro I'm like okay I

1149
00:47:40,139 --> 00:47:45,179
I'm out of potassium I need to just

1150
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:47,940
apply potassium but what what do you do

1151
00:47:45,179 --> 00:47:49,618
as an analyst on something like that

1152
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:51,599
normally when you have to remember

1153
00:47:49,619 --> 00:47:53,579
normally I'm doing mostly mineral and

1154
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:58,800
hydroponic situations

1155
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:59,519
um like regular cocoa to yeah but

1156
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:01,800
um

1157
00:47:59,519 --> 00:48:03,719
we always look at the total environment

1158
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:06,960
so if we see a tissue is low in

1159
00:48:03,719 --> 00:48:09,899
potassium then we would immediately look

1160
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:11,760
at and it and it's not like it's like

1161
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:13,858
low over time and you're like we can't

1162
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:16,680
figure out why this is happening we

1163
00:48:13,858 --> 00:48:19,199
would look at the the root Zone make

1164
00:48:16,679 --> 00:48:21,480
sure that there's no like environmental

1165
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:24,299
situation that's holding potassium kind

1166
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:26,219
of Hostage or back or you know bound

1167
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:29,160
with something else so make sure the pH

1168
00:48:26,219 --> 00:48:31,379
is right make sure that they are hitting

1169
00:48:29,159 --> 00:48:34,559
the moisture content so that they're

1170
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:36,300
able to provide a nice soil solution to

1171
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:38,759
the roots

1172
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:41,339
um and then also look at the nutrient

1173
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:43,500
input if we're using a fertilizer or

1174
00:48:41,338 --> 00:48:45,779
nutrient solution like do you actually

1175
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:47,639
have potassium in there that you think

1176
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:49,740
you did but now you really don't and

1177
00:48:47,639 --> 00:48:51,900
that's the problem

1178
00:48:49,739 --> 00:48:53,639
um for Hydroponics it's it's a little

1179
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:56,460
bit quicker because you're dealing with

1180
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:59,338
water so you can almost eliminate

1181
00:48:56,460 --> 00:49:01,500
certain things and grow directly back to

1182
00:48:59,338 --> 00:49:03,779
your nutrient Source like okay what are

1183
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:06,838
we doing and why isn't the plant able to

1184
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:09,119
get the potassium that it's needed so

1185
00:49:06,838 --> 00:49:13,380
it's really just backtracking to see

1186
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:17,300
where in the in the system there could

1187
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:17,300
be some issues of concern

1188
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:22,980
okay and and correct me if I'm wrong in

1189
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:25,140
this but as an organic grower I just

1190
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:26,639
want to be aware of what my inputs into

1191
00:49:25,139 --> 00:49:30,539
my media were

1192
00:49:26,639 --> 00:49:32,279
at the beginning because if I added

1193
00:49:30,539 --> 00:49:35,099
not that I use this product much but

1194
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:36,319
granulated kmeg sulfate of potash

1195
00:49:35,099 --> 00:49:39,660
magnesia

1196
00:49:36,318 --> 00:49:42,179
I and it was Grant in a granular form so

1197
00:49:39,659 --> 00:49:44,159
it wasn't immediately available I'm not

1198
00:49:42,179 --> 00:49:45,719
seeing it in a tissue test yet but I

1199
00:49:44,159 --> 00:49:47,818
will know that it's it's probably being

1200
00:49:45,719 --> 00:49:49,858
broken broken down by microorganisms by

1201
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:51,900
water and that it's going to be coming

1202
00:49:49,858 --> 00:49:54,358
down the line I want to be a little more

1203
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:57,240
conservative with adding

1204
00:49:54,358 --> 00:49:59,519
something like a soluble potassium

1205
00:49:57,239 --> 00:50:01,618
sulfate that's going to be 50 potassium

1206
00:49:59,519 --> 00:50:03,239
and I I don't want to overdo it I guess

1207
00:50:01,619 --> 00:50:05,400
would be my concern there that's exactly

1208
00:50:03,239 --> 00:50:08,939
that's exactly right you have such the

1209
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:12,240
potential in every situation to react

1210
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:14,940
and overreact that can almost cause more

1211
00:50:12,239 --> 00:50:16,919
harm than good like in the case that

1212
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:20,940
you're saying with the granular sop

1213
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:23,220
sulfate a potash sometimes I've seen all

1214
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:25,380
that is is a factor of like surface area

1215
00:50:23,219 --> 00:50:27,179
like the particle size was slightly

1216
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:30,119
bigger than they they were used to

1217
00:50:27,179 --> 00:50:33,838
before so like you're saying it's coming

1218
00:50:30,119 --> 00:50:36,660
it's just taking longer it's there but

1219
00:50:33,838 --> 00:50:39,000
it's just not following the same release

1220
00:50:36,659 --> 00:50:40,379
pattern that maybe the last time you had

1221
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:43,500
more surface area and it was like

1222
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:46,318
quicker so yeah you that's why

1223
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:49,260
consideration of everything is so

1224
00:50:46,318 --> 00:50:51,960
important before making a a rash

1225
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:53,819
adjustment that you can't take back

1226
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:57,599
you know

1227
00:50:53,818 --> 00:51:01,800
great great so I had two other topics uh

1228
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:05,700
the next one being Brix testing now I'm

1229
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:09,539
aware of Brix testing in um grapes and

1230
00:51:05,699 --> 00:51:13,439
other crops where the the sugar level of

1231
00:51:09,539 --> 00:51:16,139
a crop provides greater value to the

1232
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:18,000
to the grower but I'm hearing claims in

1233
00:51:16,139 --> 00:51:21,239
cannabis around bricks testing being

1234
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:23,099
useful higher bricks means that you have

1235
00:51:21,239 --> 00:51:23,939
a plant that's going to resist pests

1236
00:51:23,099 --> 00:51:26,099
which

1237
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:28,159
if Suzanne was on here she'd be shaking

1238
00:51:26,099 --> 00:51:30,660
her head and saying that's not true

1239
00:51:28,159 --> 00:51:32,039
based on what entomologists are finding

1240
00:51:30,659 --> 00:51:34,019
so I'll throw that out there but there's

1241
00:51:32,039 --> 00:51:36,358
a lot of claims around brics testing is

1242
00:51:34,019 --> 00:51:38,338
this like pansia for like

1243
00:51:36,358 --> 00:51:41,098
optimal healthy plants you raise the

1244
00:51:38,338 --> 00:51:43,019
bricks your plants healthier

1245
00:51:41,099 --> 00:51:45,980
what's what's really going on there or

1246
00:51:43,019 --> 00:51:45,980
what do you what do you think

1247
00:51:46,199 --> 00:51:51,480
yeah I mean

1248
00:51:48,139 --> 00:51:54,480
unfortunately I wish I had more like to

1249
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:58,800
contribute here but as a horticulturist

1250
00:51:54,480 --> 00:52:01,858
that does mostly nutrient testing we

1251
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:06,359
don't really look at the bricks testing

1252
00:52:01,858 --> 00:52:10,739
this and consideration of like trying to

1253
00:52:06,358 --> 00:52:12,900
devise the most Optimum nutrient health

1254
00:52:10,739 --> 00:52:16,799
um I mean obviously when you're thinking

1255
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:19,139
about what what is the cytoplasm what's

1256
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:22,140
that's what is the cell filled with

1257
00:52:19,139 --> 00:52:24,719
what's the cellular water components you

1258
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:27,659
know sugars is a huge part of it

1259
00:52:24,719 --> 00:52:31,500
nutrients sugars organic acids aminos

1260
00:52:27,659 --> 00:52:35,639
enzymes they're all in there and and

1261
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:39,059
having them balance together is what you

1262
00:52:35,639 --> 00:52:41,879
know boosts a healthy plant metabolism

1263
00:52:39,059 --> 00:52:42,960
um is that something that a Brix test

1264
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:46,500
can

1265
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:48,900
can say okay if it's a higher Brix test

1266
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:50,818
than your plant is has a more

1267
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:52,800
functioning metabolism kind of like a

1268
00:52:50,818 --> 00:52:54,300
human you know do you want your boosted

1269
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:57,480
metabolism is that going to be a

1270
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:59,660
healthier plant yeah I don't know

1271
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:02,818
um I feel that

1272
00:52:59,659 --> 00:53:05,219
for just making sure the plant can

1273
00:53:02,818 --> 00:53:07,679
complete its life cycle

1274
00:53:05,219 --> 00:53:11,338
really having a grasp on the nutrient

1275
00:53:07,679 --> 00:53:14,098
concentration of the plant tissue is

1276
00:53:11,338 --> 00:53:16,019
super super important because if you

1277
00:53:14,099 --> 00:53:18,838
like you go back to your limiting factor

1278
00:53:16,019 --> 00:53:21,838
if you have one of those Essential

1279
00:53:18,838 --> 00:53:23,880
Elements as missing the plant won't be

1280
00:53:21,838 --> 00:53:27,000
able to complete its life cycle that's

1281
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:29,940
not the case with sugars

1282
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:34,679
um you know but

1283
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:36,240
they all obviously work together so yeah

1284
00:53:34,679 --> 00:53:39,239
I don't know if that was the answer you

1285
00:53:36,239 --> 00:53:40,979
wanted to hear Tad but I don't know

1286
00:53:39,239 --> 00:53:42,659
that's what I got no I don't I don't

1287
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:44,579
have a I don't have a perfect answer on

1288
00:53:42,659 --> 00:53:48,179
that I'm always open to learning more

1289
00:53:44,579 --> 00:53:50,700
um I I the way I hear from you is it's

1290
00:53:48,179 --> 00:53:53,639
important that we have sufficiency for

1291
00:53:50,699 --> 00:53:55,460
optimal plant health

1292
00:53:53,639 --> 00:53:57,779
but um

1293
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:59,579
as I understand it from Long

1294
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:02,220
conversations with Suzanne and then with

1295
00:53:59,579 --> 00:54:04,318
other agronomists is there's no

1296
00:54:02,219 --> 00:54:08,879
fertility Target

1297
00:54:04,318 --> 00:54:11,519
from a brics perspective with this crop

1298
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:12,599
um it just it doesn't exist to my

1299
00:54:11,519 --> 00:54:14,719
knowledge

1300
00:54:12,599 --> 00:54:17,160
um but there are there are people making

1301
00:54:14,719 --> 00:54:20,879
basing all of their decisions management

1302
00:54:17,159 --> 00:54:23,279
decisions around brics levels which

1303
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:25,440
at least from what I've seen may not be

1304
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:27,660
I mean if it's working for you great but

1305
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:29,700
it may not be the best management tool

1306
00:54:27,659 --> 00:54:30,719
compared to these other tools that we

1307
00:54:29,699 --> 00:54:33,659
have like

1308
00:54:30,719 --> 00:54:35,639
tissue testing soil testing things like

1309
00:54:33,659 --> 00:54:37,500
that yeah

1310
00:54:35,639 --> 00:54:39,779
I mean plants have been grown for a long

1311
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:40,699
time plant and high value crops have

1312
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:43,380
been

1313
00:54:40,699 --> 00:54:45,899
extremely important in the history of

1314
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:48,660
our world you know from The Spice Market

1315
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:51,480
to you know the beginning of our

1316
00:54:48,659 --> 00:54:53,578
history here in America to this stage of

1317
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:55,559
what we're in now like and it's I feel

1318
00:54:53,579 --> 00:54:58,318
thankful to be able to be involved with

1319
00:54:55,559 --> 00:55:00,780
with a crop that's exciting and has all

1320
00:54:58,318 --> 00:55:03,239
this energy and passion

1321
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:04,740
into its cultivation like cannabis has

1322
00:55:03,239 --> 00:55:07,858
really been

1323
00:55:04,739 --> 00:55:09,358
fun and energizing for I think our whole

1324
00:55:07,858 --> 00:55:12,119
Green community

1325
00:55:09,358 --> 00:55:15,598
but I do feel somehow like we get down

1326
00:55:12,119 --> 00:55:18,539
these wormholes of like

1327
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:21,240
just making it more difficult than it is

1328
00:55:18,539 --> 00:55:25,019
and uh when in reality

1329
00:55:21,239 --> 00:55:26,879
like database decisions science quality

1330
00:55:25,019 --> 00:55:30,539
consistency

1331
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:33,000
you know being able to repeat what you

1332
00:55:30,539 --> 00:55:34,199
do and eliminate your variables of

1333
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:37,500
problems

1334
00:55:34,199 --> 00:55:42,358
no matter how you're growing will lead

1335
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:45,000
to a more Optimum grow like higher

1336
00:55:42,358 --> 00:55:46,920
quality product because you're putting

1337
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,539
the time into consistency and if that

1338
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:50,460
means you want to go down your pathway

1339
00:55:48,539 --> 00:55:53,099
of figuring out these little bricks and

1340
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:55,019
this and that that's great but

1341
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:58,260
um sometimes I feel like it's a little

1342
00:55:55,019 --> 00:56:00,179
more complicated than it needs to be

1343
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:03,480
um

1344
00:56:00,179 --> 00:56:05,960
as a scientist I say it a lot

1345
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:09,079
well because it is a high value crop

1346
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:12,059
because it is a medicinal plant

1347
00:56:09,079 --> 00:56:14,519
and be because people

1348
00:56:12,059 --> 00:56:17,760
care so deeply about how they grow this

1349
00:56:14,519 --> 00:56:19,679
plant I think we see

1350
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:21,420
uh we see two things we see a lot of

1351
00:56:19,679 --> 00:56:22,980
marketing that you and I have talked

1352
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:25,079
about that that may not reflect

1353
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:27,719
necessarily the quality of the product

1354
00:56:25,079 --> 00:56:30,300
or the necessity of a product

1355
00:56:27,719 --> 00:56:31,199
um but also we see

1356
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:32,760
um

1357
00:56:31,199 --> 00:56:33,838
we just see folks that want to do a

1358
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:35,640
little bit more

1359
00:56:33,838 --> 00:56:38,460
you know you think okay well my plant is

1360
00:56:35,639 --> 00:56:40,980
this healthy right now what can I add to

1361
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:42,000
make it even more healthy and a lot of

1362
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:44,039
times I think that ends up being

1363
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:47,400
detrimental but you get these like

1364
00:56:44,039 --> 00:56:49,739
highly complex feeding schedules that

1365
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:51,539
are product based around

1366
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:53,719
you know I I said like there's a lot of

1367
00:56:51,539 --> 00:56:57,300
buzzwords out there nowadays between

1368
00:56:53,719 --> 00:57:00,078
amino acids and ferments and enzymes and

1369
00:56:57,300 --> 00:57:03,960
and and these things that um

1370
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:06,300
maybe over complicating the process

1371
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:07,500
um and that's that's my concern is is

1372
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:10,200
it's not so much that you're not going

1373
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:11,519
to have a healthy plant which can happen

1374
00:57:10,199 --> 00:57:12,960
but more that you're just you're

1375
00:57:11,519 --> 00:57:15,300
spending money you don't need to spend

1376
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:17,579
to grow this plant I I told you before

1377
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:19,859
the show that I was talking to a grower

1378
00:57:17,579 --> 00:57:22,559
and he was so excited he just started

1379
00:57:19,858 --> 00:57:27,000
this new facility at this new facility

1380
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:30,420
um going to be using a combination of um

1381
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:32,699
and Jacks and and actually Beanstalk and

1382
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:33,838
um he sent me a text saying that they're

1383
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:36,299
they're going to save over a hundred

1384
00:57:33,838 --> 00:57:39,719
thousand dollars on their fertility

1385
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:41,700
program this year which blows my mind

1386
00:57:39,719 --> 00:57:43,318
um not just the scale but also just that

1387
00:57:41,699 --> 00:57:45,358
that massive amount of cost that they're

1388
00:57:43,318 --> 00:57:46,920
spending for essentially the same

1389
00:57:45,358 --> 00:57:48,659
nutrients like which is one of the

1390
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:51,300
reasons I always push against bottled

1391
00:57:48,659 --> 00:57:53,879
nutrients is because why are we paying a

1392
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:55,859
company to add water to our product

1393
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:57,420
um water when we can do that ourselves

1394
00:57:55,858 --> 00:58:00,779
you know we're shipping it we're

1395
00:57:57,420 --> 00:58:01,980
shipping water around it's crazy so

1396
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:04,859
um you know from a sustainability

1397
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:06,539
perspective not just for the environment

1398
00:58:04,858 --> 00:58:07,920
and like I said in shipping water but

1399
00:58:06,539 --> 00:58:10,558
also for

1400
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:12,599
um our you know our pocketbooks it's

1401
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:14,700
just not very practical so I appreciate

1402
00:58:12,599 --> 00:58:16,079
you know even though I'm organic guy I

1403
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:17,039
appreciate that there are companies out

1404
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:20,220
there that are looking at more

1405
00:58:17,039 --> 00:58:21,440
sustainable ways to grow plants

1406
00:58:20,219 --> 00:58:25,199
foreign

1407
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:27,960
and it's important it's important to to

1408
00:58:25,199 --> 00:58:29,639
help people grow their crops I mean

1409
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:32,159
efficiently and that's what it's going

1410
00:58:29,639 --> 00:58:35,338
to come down to because we all need to

1411
00:58:32,159 --> 00:58:38,279
improve and think sustainably and and

1412
00:58:35,338 --> 00:58:40,798
and not in a wasteful manner so I'm

1413
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:44,099
happy that even though Jax is a

1414
00:58:40,798 --> 00:58:47,400
fertilizer company we do spend a lot of

1415
00:58:44,099 --> 00:58:51,059
time in formulation to to deliver the

1416
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:54,480
ratios that are not wasteful and not

1417
00:58:51,059 --> 00:58:56,880
snake oil like truly scientific based to

1418
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:58,019
try and you know deliver what it says

1419
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:59,519
and that's the end of it so people

1420
00:58:58,019 --> 00:59:02,219
always say well why would you make this

1421
00:58:59,519 --> 00:59:05,099
fertilizer it's you know because of its

1422
00:59:02,219 --> 00:59:06,959
efficiency your you know cost and use is

1423
00:59:05,099 --> 00:59:10,019
like three cents per gallon you're only

1424
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:12,119
using one bag in whatever 3 000 gallons

1425
00:59:10,019 --> 00:59:14,460
it's like if you did it differently you

1426
00:59:12,119 --> 00:59:16,380
could sell more it's like well

1427
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:18,420
we have at the end of the day what what

1428
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:21,720
does this mean you know what I mean like

1429
00:59:18,420 --> 00:59:24,960
I don't know so we just have a little

1430
00:59:21,719 --> 00:59:28,159
different kind of mode of operation here

1431
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:32,400
in Allentown PA

1432
00:59:28,159 --> 00:59:34,500
yeah so so last topic and we're already

1433
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:35,460
kind of going along as I nearly probably

1434
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:36,900
would

1435
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:39,358
um but I just wanted to touch on heavy

1436
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:40,559
metals so yeah

1437
00:59:39,358 --> 00:59:43,679
um do you have time for that real quick

1438
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:44,940
yep yep

1439
00:59:43,679 --> 00:59:47,219
Okay so

1440
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:50,099
uh heavy metals as you know there's the

1441
00:59:47,219 --> 00:59:52,858
appco standards so and we'll see those

1442
00:59:50,099 --> 00:59:54,180
in the wsda Oda

1443
00:59:52,858 --> 00:59:56,338
um Omri

1444
00:59:54,179 --> 01:00:00,239
cdfa especially

1445
00:59:56,338 --> 01:00:02,818
um I'll follow this standard

1446
01:00:00,239 --> 01:00:04,919
um States however with cannabis do not

1447
01:00:02,818 --> 01:00:08,099
follow that same standard they have they

1448
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:10,920
they have a tighter standard regulation

1449
01:00:08,099 --> 01:00:13,859
in a lot of cases around heavy metals in

1450
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:14,940
in flower in the final product

1451
01:00:13,858 --> 01:00:18,659
um

1452
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:20,220
it appears we don't really know exactly

1453
01:00:18,659 --> 01:00:22,798
how much

1454
01:00:20,219 --> 01:00:25,618
is too much arsenic or cadmium or lead

1455
01:00:22,798 --> 01:00:27,719
in a media or in a fertilizer program to

1456
01:00:25,619 --> 01:00:29,579
cause a fail because of all the

1457
01:00:27,719 --> 01:00:30,959
variability whether that's you know like

1458
01:00:29,579 --> 01:00:32,880
we talked about lighting environment

1459
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:34,079
watering pH all these things are going

1460
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:36,240
to affect

1461
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:37,818
heavy metal uptake

1462
01:00:36,239 --> 01:00:40,199
um yeah

1463
01:00:37,818 --> 01:00:42,298
so first question how are folks doing in

1464
01:00:40,199 --> 01:00:44,818
Jax fertilizers in some of these more

1465
01:00:42,298 --> 01:00:46,440
stringent States and how do we how as a

1466
01:00:44,818 --> 01:00:48,659
grower do I avoid

1467
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:51,200
potential risk around heavy metal

1468
01:00:48,659 --> 01:00:51,199
failure

1469
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:54,480
um

1470
01:00:52,679 --> 01:00:56,818
so

1471
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:59,338
the cool thing about

1472
01:00:56,818 --> 01:01:01,380
you know just being able to have a

1473
01:00:59,338 --> 01:01:03,779
watchful eye over our manufacturing

1474
01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:05,818
process is that we get to really you

1475
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:07,920
know make sure all of our Blends are as

1476
01:01:05,818 --> 01:01:08,699
clean as possible

1477
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:11,280
um

1478
01:01:08,699 --> 01:01:13,259
so for the Growers that use Jacks I feel

1479
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:15,960
like we get the comment quite a bit like

1480
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:17,520
they have a little less stress on their

1481
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:20,280
lives because they know we're paying so

1482
01:01:17,519 --> 01:01:22,380
much attention to our inputs you know

1483
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:25,380
it's a global market where we're getting

1484
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:28,380
all of our raw materials you know and as

1485
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:31,500
covid life really put a strain on

1486
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:34,680
you know the timeline to get things the

1487
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:36,960
sources that we could get things from

1488
01:01:34,679 --> 01:01:40,798
um the supply and demand and even still

1489
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:42,960
today you're running into some issues I

1490
01:01:40,798 --> 01:01:45,358
don't know if it's still covid life but

1491
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:47,699
maybe some of the Russian Ukraine

1492
01:01:45,358 --> 01:01:51,298
conflict that is still causing some

1493
01:01:47,699 --> 01:01:54,239
issues but what for Jax the Jax

1494
01:01:51,298 --> 01:01:56,880
customers you know we spend a lot of

1495
01:01:54,239 --> 01:01:59,338
time in qualifying these raw materials

1496
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:01,200
to get as little heavy metals as

1497
01:01:59,338 --> 01:02:03,358
possible into our raw materials and we

1498
01:02:01,199 --> 01:02:05,939
see it all the time like we have a

1499
01:02:03,358 --> 01:02:10,078
wonderful supply chain person on staff

1500
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:13,380
that's been here for three years so

1501
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:15,240
thank goodness she came before

1502
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:18,000
um and kind of took over from from one

1503
01:02:15,239 --> 01:02:19,618
of the longer term employees and was

1504
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:22,980
able to kind of

1505
01:02:19,619 --> 01:02:26,579
really understand how important the

1506
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:28,318
quality of our our raw materials were

1507
01:02:26,579 --> 01:02:29,339
um and and that was just wonderful

1508
01:02:28,318 --> 01:02:33,779
because

1509
01:02:29,338 --> 01:02:35,880
you know we you could get sources from

1510
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:38,519
all these different places all over the

1511
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:41,880
world that looks like great product it's

1512
01:02:38,519 --> 01:02:43,739
soluble it matches your pH it's a

1513
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:46,200
hundred percent within spec of the

1514
01:02:43,739 --> 01:02:48,779
nutrient that you're looking for

1515
01:02:46,199 --> 01:02:51,058
but if you went by their paperwork

1516
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:52,920
you'll be like great this looks like

1517
01:02:51,059 --> 01:02:54,960
wonderful you know there's no heavy

1518
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:56,880
metals in this whatsoever but if you

1519
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:59,280
don't test it yourself we test everyone

1520
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:01,680
in outside Labs we test it in our lab

1521
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:04,319
and an outside lab and we've come back

1522
01:03:01,679 --> 01:03:06,480
with things with like 15 parts per

1523
01:03:04,318 --> 01:03:09,480
million of lead in a micronutrient

1524
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:11,338
source well my goodness if we would use

1525
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:13,858
you know our micronutrients is a package

1526
01:03:11,338 --> 01:03:17,099
of like you know eight different things

1527
01:03:13,858 --> 01:03:19,078
at a minimum if every single one of them

1528
01:03:17,099 --> 01:03:21,599
had 10 parts per million lead in there

1529
01:03:19,079 --> 01:03:25,019
you would be over in a second

1530
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:28,260
so you know it's super important to kind

1531
01:03:25,019 --> 01:03:29,818
of qualify those raw materials and so

1532
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:32,059
what I hear a lot just circling back to

1533
01:03:29,818 --> 01:03:35,099
that is that the Jax Growers are happy

1534
01:03:32,059 --> 01:03:38,700
that they know that we're paying

1535
01:03:35,099 --> 01:03:41,280
attention to that and we've had many

1536
01:03:38,699 --> 01:03:43,858
many successful you know end products

1537
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:45,420
and and it's been fun to be involved

1538
01:03:43,858 --> 01:03:47,818
with people being happy with their

1539
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:48,960
success but you know we have had people

1540
01:03:47,818 --> 01:03:51,358
fail

1541
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:53,280
and it you know we've helped them go

1542
01:03:51,358 --> 01:03:55,558
down the path of like is it the

1543
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:57,540
nutrients or is it other things and like

1544
01:03:55,559 --> 01:03:59,280
you said you hate to point fingers

1545
01:03:57,539 --> 01:04:02,039
anywhere but we just try and help them

1546
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:03,540
figure out where it could be from

1547
01:04:02,039 --> 01:04:05,699
did that answer your question or did

1548
01:04:03,539 --> 01:04:08,338
that answer one of your questions yeah

1549
01:04:05,699 --> 01:04:10,679
yeah yeah I mean there's no there's no

1550
01:04:08,338 --> 01:04:11,219
perfect answer there right

1551
01:04:10,679 --> 01:04:13,618
um

1552
01:04:11,219 --> 01:04:15,000
I had a grower in Massachusetts recently

1553
01:04:13,619 --> 01:04:16,920
that failed

1554
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:20,400
um they were growing in seven gallon

1555
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:22,500
pots using our soil and also using a

1556
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:24,660
cocoa product and then they were adding

1557
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:26,940
a

1558
01:04:24,659 --> 01:04:30,598
they were feeding on top of that with

1559
01:04:26,940 --> 01:04:33,059
another nutrient A Part B nutrient

1560
01:04:30,599 --> 01:04:36,359
essentially and

1561
01:04:33,059 --> 01:04:37,920
it was an organic one but they uh

1562
01:04:36,358 --> 01:04:39,719
they failed on some of their crop and

1563
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:40,798
the variability on the test results was

1564
01:04:39,719 --> 01:04:41,818
all over the board and it was

1565
01:04:40,798 --> 01:04:43,440
interesting

1566
01:04:41,818 --> 01:04:46,259
um so first of all like people

1567
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:48,000
automatically blame the fertilizer or

1568
01:04:46,260 --> 01:04:49,859
the media because it's a very common

1569
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,900
source for heavy metals

1570
01:04:49,858 --> 01:04:53,759
um yeah but we do like you said you have

1571
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:55,500
to be a detective so like we got on a we

1572
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:57,660
got on a call with a long call going

1573
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:58,980
over all their inputs and then we went

1574
01:04:57,659 --> 01:05:00,598
back and we started testing all their

1575
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:04,199
inputs because at the end of the day

1576
01:05:00,599 --> 01:05:05,700
like and no offense to you I shouldn't

1577
01:05:04,199 --> 01:05:08,219
take Jack's word on it I should be

1578
01:05:05,699 --> 01:05:10,439
testing my product because it's it's

1579
01:05:08,219 --> 01:05:12,419
um it's it's I'm the one on the hook as

1580
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:14,460
the grower and I I say the same about

1581
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:16,500
kiss organic stuff like when people tell

1582
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:18,539
me they've tested my product I

1583
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:20,338
good job like let's let's talk about the

1584
01:05:18,539 --> 01:05:21,659
results do you think they're high do you

1585
01:05:20,338 --> 01:05:23,699
think they're low how is this going to

1586
01:05:21,659 --> 01:05:26,098
impact a crop like it's it's a good

1587
01:05:23,699 --> 01:05:28,078
conversation because especially in

1588
01:05:26,099 --> 01:05:30,359
Organics we're we're going to have heavy

1589
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:32,220
metals probably in levels higher well

1590
01:05:30,358 --> 01:05:34,259
definitely in levels higher than you can

1591
01:05:32,219 --> 01:05:35,879
in mineral salts so it's All About

1592
01:05:34,260 --> 01:05:38,160
Management how much

1593
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:39,900
are we how much is being taken out by

1594
01:05:38,159 --> 01:05:41,519
the plant how much are we putting in

1595
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:42,599
initially and then if we're reusing that

1596
01:05:41,519 --> 01:05:45,900
media

1597
01:05:42,599 --> 01:05:48,298
what what can we add to stay below the

1598
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:50,220
withdrawal rate of the plant and still

1599
01:05:48,298 --> 01:05:53,159
pass for whatever the regular regulatory

1600
01:05:50,219 --> 01:05:55,858
body is and just even since the last

1601
01:05:53,159 --> 01:05:58,019
time um I posted on social media about

1602
01:05:55,858 --> 01:06:00,480
this we found out that the pH Down

1603
01:05:58,019 --> 01:06:02,219
product they were using was actually

1604
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:05,338
causing

1605
01:06:02,219 --> 01:06:08,519
um or being a heavy contributor to the

1606
01:06:05,338 --> 01:06:10,798
overall failure of their crop and I've

1607
01:06:08,519 --> 01:06:14,159
seen this twice now with PH down so I

1608
01:06:10,798 --> 01:06:16,199
just want to caution folks on that um

1609
01:06:14,159 --> 01:06:17,818
yeah the other one something you don't

1610
01:06:16,199 --> 01:06:20,639
think about you know

1611
01:06:17,818 --> 01:06:22,798
yeah no and I've heard that with some PH

1612
01:06:20,639 --> 01:06:25,618
down products and then also the one we

1613
01:06:22,798 --> 01:06:27,239
see quite a bit is gypsum sources people

1614
01:06:25,619 --> 01:06:30,798
that

1615
01:06:27,239 --> 01:06:34,139
um add in Gypsum as either a soil soil

1616
01:06:30,798 --> 01:06:36,420
stabilizer or as a source of calcium and

1617
01:06:34,139 --> 01:06:39,960
sulfur that doesn't change pH

1618
01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:41,400
some sources of gypsum

1619
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:43,798
um are

1620
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:47,160
um you know it's a function of the oh my

1621
01:06:43,798 --> 01:06:49,559
gosh I'm blanking out the Home Building

1622
01:06:47,159 --> 01:06:52,318
um industry like what is that oh drywall

1623
01:06:49,559 --> 01:06:54,359
you know drywall drywall is made of

1624
01:06:52,318 --> 01:06:57,838
gypsum yeah whatever that's called

1625
01:06:54,358 --> 01:07:01,199
drywall wall board or whatever and

1626
01:06:57,838 --> 01:07:02,519
um you're right yeah right you know

1627
01:07:01,199 --> 01:07:04,919
obviously I'm not like renovating

1628
01:07:02,519 --> 01:07:07,980
anything in my house here but

1629
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:11,220
um yeah so it's a function of that and

1630
01:07:07,980 --> 01:07:14,579
that market doesn't care you know really

1631
01:07:11,219 --> 01:07:18,239
about the low levels of cat it's mostly

1632
01:07:14,579 --> 01:07:19,920
cadmium cadmium and arsenic in there and

1633
01:07:18,239 --> 01:07:23,159
um but then when you take it in those

1634
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:25,338
fine particles you know and that's back

1635
01:07:23,159 --> 01:07:28,259
to like particle size and surface area

1636
01:07:25,338 --> 01:07:30,779
you can see a significant release of

1637
01:07:28,260 --> 01:07:33,539
those materials into a crop so we've

1638
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:36,000
seen that in like nutrient charges and

1639
01:07:33,539 --> 01:07:39,859
whatnot so um that's another thing to

1640
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:39,858
watch out for out there

1641
01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:43,500
yeah all of these mined products

1642
01:07:41,639 --> 01:07:45,960
anything coming out of the ocean is

1643
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:47,699
going to have some heavy metal load and

1644
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:50,460
it's so it's just all about managing it

1645
01:07:47,699 --> 01:07:53,578
really and keeping it lower and and keep

1646
01:07:50,460 --> 01:07:56,039
in mind too like if I if I register my

1647
01:07:53,579 --> 01:07:58,680
product properly as a fertilizer with

1648
01:07:56,039 --> 01:08:00,299
the wsda with cdfa

1649
01:07:58,679 --> 01:08:03,058
um and then I you can go online and look

1650
01:08:00,298 --> 01:08:04,519
at those levels keep in mind that's

1651
01:08:03,059 --> 01:08:07,140
that's

1652
01:08:04,519 --> 01:08:09,838
manufacturer submitted that's not a test

1653
01:08:07,139 --> 01:08:12,659
that the wsda or the cdfa did that was

1654
01:08:09,838 --> 01:08:15,900
independent it's a lab test that I sent

1655
01:08:12,659 --> 01:08:18,778
in to a lab of my product they sent it

1656
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:20,880
back as as a certified analysis and then

1657
01:08:18,779 --> 01:08:22,819
I sent that on to the regulatory

1658
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:25,440
certifying agency

1659
01:08:22,819 --> 01:08:27,920
no one's really checking that process

1660
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:29,579
they're kind of taking your word for it

1661
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:32,219
which

1662
01:08:29,579 --> 01:08:33,960
is scary ultimately is a little scary

1663
01:08:32,219 --> 01:08:37,380
depending on how much you trust the

1664
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:40,619
company but I've definitely seen levels

1665
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:43,380
that are different than what is on the

1666
01:08:40,619 --> 01:08:45,238
test that they're that's been submitted

1667
01:08:43,380 --> 01:08:46,739
I guess to the cdfa or what people are

1668
01:08:45,238 --> 01:08:49,858
showing on social media versus what

1669
01:08:46,738 --> 01:08:52,439
you're seeing in um

1670
01:08:49,859 --> 01:08:54,000
you know yeah from the certifying agency

1671
01:08:52,439 --> 01:08:56,698
so

1672
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:58,619
yeah and that's that's a shame that's

1673
01:08:56,698 --> 01:09:00,119
you know you have to choose to do

1674
01:08:58,619 --> 01:09:02,460
business with people whose character

1675
01:09:00,119 --> 01:09:05,579
should be reflected in their their

1676
01:09:02,460 --> 01:09:07,798
products so yeah it's the same at

1677
01:09:05,579 --> 01:09:10,738
fertilizers we we do a lot of off-site

1678
01:09:07,798 --> 01:09:12,659
testing and we send it into different

1679
01:09:10,738 --> 01:09:14,039
state all the states we have to register

1680
01:09:12,659 --> 01:09:15,719
our fertilizers in all the different

1681
01:09:14,039 --> 01:09:19,019
states same type of thing and then they

1682
01:09:15,719 --> 01:09:22,500
post the results we do it at an off site

1683
01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:23,940
lab and then just send that in so I

1684
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:25,439
don't know how we would mess with that

1685
01:09:23,939 --> 01:09:26,698
but I guess you could if you really

1686
01:09:25,439 --> 01:09:29,358
wanted to

1687
01:09:26,698 --> 01:09:29,358
you know

1688
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:32,520
yeah it's just something for people to

1689
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:34,439
be aware of that a lot of this stuff is

1690
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:36,120
self-reported

1691
01:09:34,439 --> 01:09:37,738
um the Oda Oregon Department of

1692
01:09:36,119 --> 01:09:39,238
Agriculture does do some independent

1693
01:09:37,738 --> 01:09:41,278
testing that they publish which is

1694
01:09:39,238 --> 01:09:43,619
wonderful the wsca has done a little bit

1695
01:09:41,279 --> 01:09:45,299
of it too but they're testing like one

1696
01:09:43,619 --> 01:09:45,899
percent of the market maybe

1697
01:09:45,298 --> 01:09:47,579
um

1698
01:09:45,899 --> 01:09:49,259
so we're not really seeing everything

1699
01:09:47,579 --> 01:09:52,380
that's out there

1700
01:09:49,259 --> 01:09:53,819
um but yeah no I I really appreciate you

1701
01:09:52,380 --> 01:09:56,579
talking a little bit with me about heavy

1702
01:09:53,819 --> 01:09:59,520
metals and soil testing and tissue

1703
01:09:56,579 --> 01:10:00,779
testing uh was there anything else you

1704
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:02,280
wanted to add anything that you're

1705
01:10:00,779 --> 01:10:05,639
really excited about

1706
01:10:02,279 --> 01:10:07,679
um upcoming in the next year

1707
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:09,480
well I don't know I love having

1708
01:10:07,679 --> 01:10:13,260
conversations with you Tad as you know

1709
01:10:09,479 --> 01:10:16,019
that I feel that sharing information and

1710
01:10:13,260 --> 01:10:18,600
you know talking from different

1711
01:10:16,020 --> 01:10:20,520
perspectives really helps everyone kind

1712
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:22,199
of broaden their knowledge and growing

1713
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:25,980
any type of crop you know and

1714
01:10:22,198 --> 01:10:28,319
contributing to Horticulture as a whole

1715
01:10:25,979 --> 01:10:31,259
um no from Jax I mean we're we're on it

1716
01:10:28,319 --> 01:10:34,039
we're constantly looking at ways to

1717
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:36,960
deliver the most efficient

1718
01:10:34,039 --> 01:10:38,880
science-based mineral fertilizers out

1719
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:40,980
there I always say like I can't wait in

1720
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:43,500
life till I get to go down the path of

1721
01:10:40,979 --> 01:10:46,559
like a more organic thinking I always

1722
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:48,658
like you know I have a garden my house

1723
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:51,780
like I do things a certain way here too
