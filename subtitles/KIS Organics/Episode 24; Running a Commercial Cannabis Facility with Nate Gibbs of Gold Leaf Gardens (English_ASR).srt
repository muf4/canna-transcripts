16
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:50,519
podcasts can get more technical or

17
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:52,050
science focus however for this podcast I

18
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,820
wanted to talk directly with a grower to

19
00:00:52,049 --> 00:00:55,619
get some hands-on experience and

20
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,600
knowledge from someone in the industry I

21
00:00:55,619 --> 00:00:59,849
had the honor of sitting down with my

22
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,010
good friend Nate Gibbs owner of goldleaf

23
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:04,320
Gardens a tier 2 producer here in

24
00:01:02,009 --> 00:01:06,209
Washington State gold leaf is an

25
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,279
excellent proof of concept for living

26
00:01:06,209 --> 00:01:10,169
soils and this style of cultivation on a

27
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,118
commercial scale they are known for

28
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,760
having some of the top shelf flour in

29
00:01:12,118 --> 00:01:16,978
the state this podcast was my first

30
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,020
attempt at a video podcast and we shot

31
00:01:16,978 --> 00:01:21,030
it in Origins coffee shop which is right

32
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:23,009
next door to origins cannabis shop a

33
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,359
recreational store here in Washington

34
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:27,150
State that is taking a unique approach

35
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:28,709
to selling cannabis by focusing on the

36
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:31,469
customer experience and selecting the

37
00:01:28,709 --> 00:01:34,379
right product based on the CBD to THC

38
00:01:31,469 --> 00:01:36,750
levels let me start by saying I'm not a

39
00:01:34,379 --> 00:01:38,310
tech guy my last podcast the volume

40
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,659
levels were off and I'm constantly

41
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,700
making improvements to the recording

42
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:43,530
process I'm hoping that this can be a

43
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,478
learning experience too but I apologize

44
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:47,219
in advance for the echo as the empty

45
00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:50,640

products that they produce yeah but Nate

91
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:39,150
can you talk a little bit about your

92
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,310
history and tell us a little bit about

93
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:44,640
how you got into growing cannabis

94
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:49,229
originally um yeah I have to think about

95
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:51,000
that the you know it's it's you know

96

we're grateful for for where it's come

97
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,340
to now you know just to being in a place

98
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:58,379
like this you know out here public with

99
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:00,269

shelves and you know on TV screens and

102
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:10,199
and you know just to have the sort of

103
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:11,340
environment to be able to showcase you

104
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:13,919
know the work that we're doing at gold

105
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,930
leaf gardens and polarised racks and

106
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:19,319
lyric ana gars

107
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:21,660
it's just it's a long long unimaginable

108
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:24,418
way away from from you know the the

109
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:25,590
dingy five foot high basements that we

110
00:04:24,418 --> 00:04:29,129
were starting off in

111
00:04:25,589 --> 00:04:31,888
you know a decade ago but you know here

112
00:04:29,129 --> 00:04:35,459
we are so now let's talk about when we

113
00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:37,379
met so when I met you it was working in

114
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:39,569
collaboration on a potential project

115
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:43,228
that a friend of ours was looking to set

116
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:46,439
up and you at the time had a hundred

117
00:04:43,228 --> 00:04:50,009
light facility yeah on the medical side

118
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:51,389
that you were running and so can you

119
00:04:50,009 --> 00:04:54,418
talk a little bit about that process

120
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:55,949
yeah you know I mean you skip over a lot

121
00:04:54,418 --> 00:04:58,799
of details but you know kind of starting

122
00:04:55,949 --> 00:05:01,790
from just the early grassroots

123
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:04,199
cooperative patient to patient care

124
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:06,540
provider model here in Washington State

125
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:09,149
you know one person growing for a couple

126
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:12,180
of patients in their basement we you

127
00:05:09,149 --> 00:05:13,799
know sort of moved from there into you

128
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:15,120
know opening her own dispensary where we

129
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,949
worked with the collective of growers

130
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:21,389
and then a larger collective of patients

131
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:24,360
eventually that we outgrew our home grow

132
00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:26,250
operations and moved into our first

133
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,650
warehouse which like you said is I

134
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:30,329
bought a hundred light warehouse and

135
00:05:28,649 --> 00:05:33,659
that was a that was a big step you know

136
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:35,599
at the time you know Washington state

137
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:38,960
laws were still a little bit ambiguous

138
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:41,879
we were taking a you know sort of

139
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:45,739
progressive interpretation of the laws

140
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:49,469
and and you know that point you know

141
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:50,780
nobody knew you know day in day out if

142
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:52,800
you were gonna get shut down and

143
00:05:50,779 --> 00:05:55,500
everything seized or if you were

144
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,199
positioning yourself to become part of

145
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:00,629
this burgeoning you know

146
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:03,990
legal markets that was a that was

147
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:07,649
beginning to to become you know

148
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:09,569
legalized so so I think we met at that

149
00:06:07,649 --> 00:06:12,060
time we were we were looking at how we

150
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:15,740
were going to transition from this the

151
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:19,759
medical days the medical model into the

152
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:24,418
recreational model and and everybody was

153
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:28,110
ambitious and the future was you know

154
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:30,269
very optimistic and and there's a lot of

155
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:32,699
big money going around to finance very

156
00:06:30,269 --> 00:06:33,459
large ambitious projects so we were I

157
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:36,399
think we were

158
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:39,250
something that you know was ten times as

159
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:40,989
big as we have land anyway yeah but um

160
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:43,930
yeah the best thing that happened from

161
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:45,788
that was really meeting you we were

162
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:49,329
beginning to come into our own as

163
00:06:45,788 --> 00:06:52,360
organic growers you know sort of

164
00:06:49,329 --> 00:06:55,029
following that path from just you know

165
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:57,069
figuring it out on our own to you know

166
00:06:55,029 --> 00:06:58,839
starting to realize that was the

167
00:06:57,069 --> 00:07:01,090
direction that produced the best

168
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:03,310
products and was most in line with our

169
00:07:01,089 --> 00:07:04,899
values but we didn't really know what

170
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:07,629
we're doing can we can we talk a little

171
00:07:04,899 --> 00:07:09,698
bit about that so all right so tell me a

172
00:07:07,629 --> 00:07:12,189
little bit more about how you learned

173
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:13,620
how to grow at a time you know back then

174
00:07:12,189 --> 00:07:16,180
there was a lot of information available

175
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:17,709
what was your what was your source of

176
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:19,418
information what did you know well there

177
00:07:17,709 --> 00:07:22,089
was not a lot of information and there's

178
00:07:19,418 --> 00:07:23,769
a lot of misinformation you know you

179
00:07:22,089 --> 00:07:25,989
know the time we were you know nervous

180
00:07:23,769 --> 00:07:29,049
about even logging on to computers a

181
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:31,449
search for for info I mean it all felt

182
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:33,220
that illicit so we would go I remember

183
00:07:31,449 --> 00:07:35,770
I'd go to the they use bookstores and

184
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:37,360
get these old tattered copies of you

185
00:07:35,769 --> 00:07:42,879
know and Rosenthal book how to grow

186
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:44,408
cannabis and we you know there's a small

187
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:46,449
network of people that you know we would

188
00:07:44,408 --> 00:07:49,300
we would share ideas about what worked

189
00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:50,978
or what didn't and and then there was

190
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:53,319
you know that the local hydroponics

191
00:07:50,978 --> 00:07:58,110
store which was sort of this you know

192
00:07:53,319 --> 00:08:01,449
hub of where growers would go and and

193
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:03,520
you know cross-pollinate ideas and you

194
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:04,840
know yeah ironically you couldn't tell

195
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:06,218
anybody what you were growing but

196
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:08,500
everybody knew and you sort of had this

197
00:08:06,218 --> 00:08:12,009
little dance you had to play but um I

198
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:13,509
mean I remember I would I was so you

199
00:08:12,009 --> 00:08:14,949
know I would I tried everything you know

200
00:08:13,509 --> 00:08:16,689
I would literally if there was a new

201
00:08:14,949 --> 00:08:20,408
product on the Shelf that offered to

202
00:08:16,689 --> 00:08:24,279
boost my yields or boost my my flavors

203
00:08:20,408 --> 00:08:27,279
or fix my mites or anything I mean we I

204
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:27,908
think I tried everything and that was

205
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:31,059
about the time I

206
00:08:27,908 --> 00:08:33,189
I ran to keep it simple which was the

207
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:34,750
exact opposite philosophy I had I was

208
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:36,190
keeping it complicated but well it's

209
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:37,860
funny because we had completely

210
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:39,539
different upbringings you

211
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:41,519
and ways that we ended up around

212
00:08:39,538 --> 00:08:43,588
cannabis so for me I had no experience

213
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,610
with the plant I grew up with my parents

214
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:47,490
owning a nursery and landscaping

215
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:52,019
business so I was around plants you know

216
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:54,269
my entire life but never cannabis so for

217
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:55,679
me I'd never been to a hydro shop the

218
00:08:54,269 --> 00:08:57,299
first time I walked into hydro shop I

219
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:59,009
was like what are all these products and

220
00:08:57,299 --> 00:09:02,278
it was it was really intimidating for me

221
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:04,740
I had never seen you know fertilizer was

222
00:09:02,278 --> 00:09:07,169
like a bag with a label there were no

223
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:10,620
three yeah and three numbers there was

224
00:09:07,169 --> 00:09:13,199
no like hot chick in a bikini like these

225
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:15,539
fake monster plants and I've never seen

226
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:19,528
the word bud so much in my life yeah but

227
00:09:15,539 --> 00:09:23,399
I I was my dad's and my mom sold their

228
00:09:19,528 --> 00:09:25,049
nursery and leased the land out to the

229
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:26,730
company they sold it to and when they

230
00:09:25,049 --> 00:09:28,319
did that my dad decide you want to start

231
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:31,620
a compost tea business so this was like

232
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,480
way back in like 1999 when that whole

233
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:37,440
industry was just starting out with dr.

234
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:39,060
Ingham and so he had this compost tea

235
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,380
business that was going and we I was I

236
00:09:39,059 --> 00:09:41,849
came back from Australia and started

237
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:43,828
helping him out and he'd get these phone

238
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:47,060
calls from guys to be like yeah I got

239
00:09:43,828 --> 00:09:49,169
you know 20 tomato plants in my basement

240
00:09:47,059 --> 00:09:50,429
and it took me a little it took me a

241
00:09:49,169 --> 00:09:52,169
little while you know I was like how

242
00:09:50,429 --> 00:09:53,759
these guys really like their pasta sauce

243
00:09:52,169 --> 00:09:55,740
or I figured out what they were actually

244
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:57,269
growing and I started googling compost

245
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:59,820
tea and found some forums online

246
00:09:57,269 --> 00:10:00,659
but even with the forums you know you're

247
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:03,480
right there was a lot of misinformation

248
00:10:00,659 --> 00:10:06,929
I mean there still is but on top of that

249
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:09,300
it did feel a little illicit it was a

250
00:10:06,929 --> 00:10:10,769
little scary you know what yeah what

251
00:10:09,299 --> 00:10:14,519
direction the industry was heading and

252
00:10:10,769 --> 00:10:17,669
then like you said we met and at that

253
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:20,490
time I'd been working and learning about

254
00:10:17,669 --> 00:10:23,159
soils and just getting into cannabis

255
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:25,860
myself and started working with giant

256
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:27,870
Palmer you know you know in regards to

257
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:31,440
testing out different soil recipes and

258
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:34,110
seeing how we could grow the plant more

259
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:37,740
organically and without all of these

260
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:38,769
other products and so Jaya was really

261
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:41,080
instrumental in that

262
00:10:38,769 --> 00:10:43,208
and it was it was quite a journey you

263
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:45,310
know it was a lot of fun getting to

264
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:46,629
learn about an entirely new plant and

265
00:10:45,309 --> 00:10:47,619
learning how to grow indoors it's

266
00:10:46,629 --> 00:10:51,700
totally different than growing outdoors

267
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:54,209
and and and the higher value of the crop

268
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:56,920
sort of allows you to to really

269
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:58,359
experiment with inputs that I you know

270
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:59,829
just don't make sense if you're if

271
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,750
you're actually growing tomatoes or

272
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:03,730
you're growing you know cabbage or

273
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:05,830
something and so I think it kind of

274
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:07,899
opens up the whole of the realm of like

275
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:10,240
you know well if we can absorb these

276
00:11:07,899 --> 00:11:12,759
these input cause you know we know how

277
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,669
to really maximize this plan you know a

278
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:17,528
ten percent yield in a cannabis harvest

279
00:11:14,669 --> 00:11:19,179
you know could be thousands and

280
00:11:17,528 --> 00:11:21,580
thousands of dollars right and so so

281
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:26,379
you're think that's part of what drives

282
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:28,810
that the cannabis nutrient market of you

283
00:11:26,379 --> 00:11:33,159
know trying to always sell you more and

284
00:11:28,809 --> 00:11:37,869
more some of which works and yeah what's

285
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:40,120
does it yeah at all when we originally

286
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:42,339
were working on the soils that I thought

287
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:44,019
was really interesting was the goal

288
00:11:42,339 --> 00:11:46,510
initially was not a commercial

289
00:11:44,019 --> 00:11:49,088
application it was to create a product

290
00:11:46,509 --> 00:11:50,769
where a cancer patient or a medical

291
00:11:49,089 --> 00:11:52,390
patient could walk into a hydro shop and

292
00:11:50,769 --> 00:11:54,309
rather than getting hit with all of

293
00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:56,139
these you know bottles and nutrient

294
00:11:54,309 --> 00:11:58,119
lines and this craziness they could just

295
00:11:56,139 --> 00:12:00,278
take a bag of soil and walk out the door

296
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,959
and just water their plant and then Jaya

297
00:12:00,278 --> 00:12:03,639
was able to start figuring out some of

298
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:05,049
these commercial applications on scale

299
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:06,490
which is sort of when we met you and you

300
00:12:05,049 --> 00:12:08,919
were doing some of our first trials too

301
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:10,600
with the product and I know there was a

302
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:11,799
learning curve there and like some you

303
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:15,700
know it didn't work quite as well as you

304
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:19,120
wanted initially yeah but well I mean we

305
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:22,980
were skeptical just because you know it

306
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:26,860
was such a different thought process

307
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:29,230
than what we had been sort of accustomed

308
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:32,470
to in terms of buying a lot of bottles

309
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:34,210
of you know off the shelf we had a

310
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:37,420
I think you you know you remember we had

311
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:39,960
a really complicated recipe yeah you had

312
00:12:37,419 --> 00:12:42,610
this this piece of paper I remember yeah

313
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:44,320
five milliliters of this and three

314
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:47,289
milliliters at this on the fourth day

315
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,820
and then on the eighth day algorithm you

316
00:12:47,289 --> 00:12:50,409
know it was insane it was the craziest

317
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:51,970
nutrient I've ever seen and your plants

318
00:12:50,409 --> 00:12:54,039
look great like yeah you know you guys

319
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:55,509
were really good growers and I think

320
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:56,819
that's an important aspect of it well I

321
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:58,899
think you know what was happening

322
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:01,120
because it was you know we were

323
00:12:58,899 --> 00:13:02,889
successful I mean at the time you know

324
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:07,830
and you know you couldn't tell me that I

325
00:13:02,889 --> 00:13:07,830
wasn't growing the best cannabis then

326
00:13:08,009 --> 00:13:15,429
which I wasn't but yeah the you know we

327
00:13:13,929 --> 00:13:16,599
had so many things going I mean I would

328
00:13:15,429 --> 00:13:19,989
talk to all these people and they say

329
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:21,909
old it you know the secret ingredient is

330
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:24,340
you know roots accelerator the secret

331
00:13:21,909 --> 00:13:27,279
ingredient is this by booster this and

332
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:28,810
that so I would you know my logic was

333
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,459
well if I take everybody secret

334
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:34,929
ingredients and it's just gonna have to

335
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:36,850
be awesome right yeah and and but it's

336
00:13:34,929 --> 00:13:39,009
you end up coming out with like you know

337
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:40,149
pretty good results but because we

338
00:13:39,009 --> 00:13:42,370
weren't very scientific about it we

339
00:13:40,149 --> 00:13:44,649
couldn't tell you what it was that was

340
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:46,509
leading to that right and what was just

341
00:13:44,649 --> 00:13:48,159
more things we're buying I know I was

342
00:13:46,509 --> 00:13:50,559
spending a lot of money yeah I had a

343
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:53,799
very complicated recipe well there's a

344
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:56,199
lot of redundancy and as you taught me

345
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:58,839
there's a lot of bottles of things I was

346
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,890
greatly overpaying for because you know

347
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:03,009
it might have been them

348
00:13:59,889 --> 00:14:05,049
now then I look back it's you know guano

349
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:06,519
suspended in water but it's you know $50

350
00:14:05,049 --> 00:14:09,099
a bottle instead of you know the dry

351
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:10,629
inputs you buy four dollars of dollars I

352
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:12,460
think five of the bottles you had had

353
00:14:10,629 --> 00:14:17,080
the same seaweed product and it right

354
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:20,070
yeah yeah for sure so let's talk a

355
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:23,920
little bit about that transition so you

356
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:26,890
did some trials with living soils and

357
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:29,529
then decided to commit your new facility

358
00:14:26,889 --> 00:14:32,080
to that method of growing with the goal

359
00:14:29,529 --> 00:14:34,409
of reusing the soil you know cycle after

360
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:36,690
cycle with minimal amending amending

361
00:14:34,409 --> 00:14:38,129
can you talk a little bit about what

362
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:39,990
your facility looks like now and how you

363
00:14:38,129 --> 00:14:41,970
set it up yeah well I remember when I

364
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:44,759
was you know kind of modeling out the

365
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:48,240
the new facility which was you know more

366
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:50,450
than twice as large you know just taking

367
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:53,909
our nutrient costs and putting on paper

368
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:57,180
taking the way we were doing things you

369
00:14:53,909 --> 00:14:59,639
know and it'd be very expensive and I

370
00:14:57,179 --> 00:15:01,589
was starting to have to think about you

371
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:04,139
know the scalability of our processes

372
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:06,389
and and it was really opportune you know

373
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:07,500
when I met you and Jaya and and you said

374
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:11,580
you know here's this you know here's

375
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:14,220
this way of growing plants which is

376
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:16,110
going to require you know which is gonna

377
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:19,920
let the plants dictate what they need

378
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:21,539
and instead of as much you know you know

379
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:23,099
as much of the growers you know

380
00:15:21,539 --> 00:15:26,219
manipulation of the of the you know

381
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:28,830
nutrient systems and and then that would

382
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:30,750
allow us to you know tend to thousands

383
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:32,370
of plants right because you know we're

384
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:33,720
you know in a short period of time in a

385
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:36,000
few years we went from you know a few

386
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:37,740
dozen in our basement to you know we

387
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,799
have four or five thousand in our garden

388
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:42,720
anytime so you know you can't do the

389
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:44,759
same things you can't give each plant

390
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,320
that seemed to have retention so so I

391
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:47,879
think that's that was you know you know

392
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,080
we're the light bulbs started to go off

393
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:51,330
but also as we were going through these

394
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:53,759
trials with sort of that as the end goal

395
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:56,370
you know we realize we're growing some

396
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,058
of the best product better than we had

397
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:59,308
been

398
00:15:57,058 --> 00:16:01,318
you know and your yield wasn't

399
00:15:59,308 --> 00:16:04,048
necessarily any larger at that time was

400
00:16:01,318 --> 00:16:08,548
it you know I don't think it was you

401
00:16:04,048 --> 00:16:11,308
know significantly larger but it wasn't

402
00:16:08,548 --> 00:16:17,308
it wasn't worse no calm I would say the

403
00:16:11,308 --> 00:16:19,348
quality was was better and also to you

404
00:16:17,308 --> 00:16:22,588
know we just found the overall health of

405
00:16:19,349 --> 00:16:25,259
our gardens began to kind of just tack

406
00:16:22,589 --> 00:16:26,489
in a different direction part of you

407
00:16:25,259 --> 00:16:30,359
know being very hands-on with the

408
00:16:26,489 --> 00:16:32,969
nutrient regimen also meant we're really

409
00:16:30,359 --> 00:16:35,699
hands-on with our sort of our IPM

410
00:16:32,969 --> 00:16:38,209
program you know we're using a lot of

411
00:16:35,698 --> 00:16:40,468
we're spraying a lot of things and

412
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:43,978
treating the soils and treating things

413
00:16:40,469 --> 00:16:45,389
above the ground and running to a lot of

414
00:16:43,979 --> 00:16:47,339
problems you know we'd have a you know

415
00:16:45,389 --> 00:16:49,048
have a lot of issues and and once we

416
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:51,839
sort of you know really let the you know

417
00:16:49,048 --> 00:16:54,629
built a good living soil environment the

418
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:58,049
plants became happier and I think their

419
00:16:54,629 --> 00:17:00,749
natural immunities began to be come

420
00:16:58,048 --> 00:17:02,818
fully actualized and we just found

421
00:17:00,749 --> 00:17:06,149
ourselves fighting a lot less problems

422
00:17:02,818 --> 00:17:07,888
so I get a lot of emails about blog post

423
00:17:06,148 --> 00:17:12,538
I put up with actually a photo from your

424
00:17:07,888 --> 00:17:14,068
facility Rhian reusing soil so you use

425
00:17:12,538 --> 00:17:16,859
you've got you got a bunch of plastic

426
00:17:14,068 --> 00:17:18,359
pallets in like blue plastic pallets

427
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:20,248
which is great because they're a lot

428
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:22,828
easier to clean and you know they're not

429
00:17:20,249 --> 00:17:25,588
gonna harbor disease like a wood pallet

430
00:17:22,828 --> 00:17:28,168
wood and then you had a custom-built

431
00:17:25,588 --> 00:17:30,480
fabric pot I believe made specifically

432
00:17:28,169 --> 00:17:31,950
for the pallets with the ID and then

433
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,480
they're on racks so they're raised up so

434
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:34,679
you're not bending over the whole time

435
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,538
you talked a little bit about like what

436
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:39,659
gives you how many rooms how you haven't

437
00:17:36,538 --> 00:17:42,269
set up yeah so you know we have so our

438
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:43,830
soil beds you know which might be kind

439
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:45,888
of a modified version of you know what

440
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:48,928
you know you and I have kind of designed

441
00:17:45,888 --> 00:17:51,269
there they sit on food grade pallets and

442
00:17:48,929 --> 00:17:55,320
then on top of that we had a geo pot

443
00:17:51,269 --> 00:17:57,359
design us a fabric bed that fits exactly

444
00:17:55,319 --> 00:17:58,558
on that pallet you know part of a great

445
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:00,689
thing about pallets for anybody

446
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:02,819
designing a large facility is there you

447
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:04,850
know a lot of material handling options

448
00:18:02,819 --> 00:18:07,618
you know warehouses house pallets

449
00:18:04,849 --> 00:18:09,089
racking forklifts everything sort of

450
00:18:07,618 --> 00:18:10,149
knows how to their affordable you're not

451
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:11,649
irrigating the way

452
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:14,490
you're not repaying the wheel exactly so

453
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:17,830
we kind of use that as our standard um

454
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:21,700
you know unit and from there we have a

455
00:18:17,829 --> 00:18:24,009
soil bed with with with you know kiss

456
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:26,980
soil that we reimagine we'd ever throw

457
00:18:24,009 --> 00:18:29,528
it out and and in each bed we'll plant

458
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:33,819
six plants and then they'll have sort of

459
00:18:29,528 --> 00:18:36,519
a independent trellis system per bed so

460
00:18:33,819 --> 00:18:39,879
we'll we'll use you know sort of a scrog

461
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:41,019
type of training too for those same six

462
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:43,659
plants that share that bed and that

463
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:45,190
trellis so you're you that's just for

464
00:18:43,659 --> 00:18:47,049
your flower room so your vegging in a

465
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:49,179
separate room in smaller containers yes

466
00:18:47,048 --> 00:18:51,269
and then transplanting into the beds for

467
00:18:49,179 --> 00:18:54,548
their final yeah so so we have one room

468
00:18:51,269 --> 00:18:55,538
that's you know one 400 square foot room

469
00:18:54,548 --> 00:18:58,089
that's dedicated to all of our

470
00:18:55,538 --> 00:19:00,669
propagation they'll spend a couple weeks

471
00:18:58,089 --> 00:19:02,678
in there in smaller plastic pots and

472
00:19:00,669 --> 00:19:05,020
then they'll move into one of our seven

473
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:09,909
production rooms each room has 50 beds

474
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:12,398
and we'll plant six plants per bed and

475
00:19:09,909 --> 00:19:14,049
then from you know so well 300 plants

476
00:19:12,398 --> 00:19:15,579
and then um and then they'll live the

477
00:19:14,048 --> 00:19:18,250
rest of their life cycle in that room

478
00:19:15,579 --> 00:19:19,960
for about we'll give it about a week of

479
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:21,460
transition time in that room just

480
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:23,500
because they're going under something

481
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:26,470
more intense lighting we found that

482
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:29,558
that's a good amount of time and also

483
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:31,630
when we harvest we try to turn that room

484
00:19:29,558 --> 00:19:36,730
over and get plants in there within a

485
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:38,528
day okay so for for reusing soil you

486
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:41,048
know we had to really figure out how we

487
00:19:38,528 --> 00:19:43,179
can thread the needle harvest our plants

488
00:19:41,048 --> 00:19:45,369
get our inputs back into the soil

489
00:19:43,179 --> 00:19:47,500
transplant in there within 24 hours

490
00:19:45,369 --> 00:19:48,699
I remember when limited to yes remember

491
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,140
when you were first doing that yeah we

492
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,519
were to play around out a lot you know

493
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,929
we were trying to put all the nutrients

494
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:54,819
back in right the beginning of the cycle

495
00:19:52,929 --> 00:19:56,740
and it was just causing this oil to heat

496
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:59,889
up from the amount of microbial activity

497
00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:01,480
was going on so what you guys sort of

498
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:04,390
figured out was okay we can put some

499
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:05,919
nutrients back in then and some organic

500
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:08,259
matter but then we'll also talk dress

501
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:11,110
nutrients yeah throughout the cycle and

502
00:20:08,259 --> 00:20:13,808
to to allow that to allow you to get

503
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:15,699
that immediate 24 hour return when you

504
00:20:13,808 --> 00:20:18,220
could start planting back in yeah it's

505
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:19,480
really you know you know if you have

506
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:22,000
that downtime to let that

507
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:23,650
those nutrients you know heat up and

508
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,980
cook in there you know you lose that

509
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:28,630
production time so you know and and if

510
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:30,190
we sort of loaded up the soil all the

511
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:32,020
way and transplanted we notice there's a

512
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:34,299
lot of transplant stress so we found you

513
00:20:32,019 --> 00:20:36,879
know we we re amend a little lighter and

514
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:38,710
then we'll use top dressings of water in

515
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,090
a few things and you know put some

516
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:42,910
things into the compost tea as we brew

517
00:20:40,089 --> 00:20:44,799
them so that they can be integrated into

518
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:46,060
the plants life cycle through so you're

519
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:47,769
not just doing water you're doing other

520
00:20:46,059 --> 00:20:50,289
things but do other things yeah a lot of

521
00:20:47,769 --> 00:20:54,000
compost tea some some foliar

522
00:20:50,289 --> 00:20:56,259
applications you know micronutrients and

523
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,200
and some you know like some top dressing

524
00:20:56,259 --> 00:21:00,549
as well and you're always experimenting

525
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,230
with new things that's one of the things

526
00:21:00,549 --> 00:21:04,210
that I really like to encourage with

527
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:05,500
growers and one thing that you and I you

528
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:07,360
always tell me to is you're always

529
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,799
trying out new things and seeing how

530
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:10,629
they do with a control and I think

531
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:13,569
that's the important aspect of it yeah

532
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:16,240
you can actually see is this one change

533
00:21:13,569 --> 00:21:18,339
making an improvement or is it making

534
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,019
things worse is it worth the amount of

535
00:21:18,339 --> 00:21:21,339
time and money I'm gonna spend on it and

536
00:21:20,019 --> 00:21:24,369
that and you know one nice things about

537
00:21:21,339 --> 00:21:28,059
you know growing at scale with a lot

538
00:21:24,369 --> 00:21:29,739
more plants a lot more beds everything

539
00:21:28,059 --> 00:21:33,190
being uniform the rooms all being

540
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:36,160
uniform is that it allows you to

541
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:37,960
dedicate you know small amount of you

542
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:40,630
know your canopy to these experiments

543
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:42,340
without really impacting your overall

544
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:44,950
production as much you know if you're

545
00:21:42,339 --> 00:21:46,720
you know when we only had you know when

546
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:49,450
I was only growing 15 plants if I wanted

547
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,130
to try something 2 to 5 plants you know

548
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:52,539
enough for a decent sample size and it

549
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:53,830
didn't work out you know it really

550
00:21:52,539 --> 00:21:56,710
impacts you now if we wanted to try and

551
00:21:53,829 --> 00:21:59,619
experiment to one or two beds you know

552
00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:01,539
they maybe don't get quite the returns

553
00:21:59,619 --> 00:22:04,449
or the the results we wanted you know

554
00:22:01,539 --> 00:22:05,859
we're still able to absorb that so you

555
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:07,809
know it's hopefully leading to

556
00:22:05,859 --> 00:22:10,990
improvement year over year I think yeah

557
00:22:07,809 --> 00:22:12,339
so one of the challenges with the style

558
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:15,130
of growing they're doing with reusing

559
00:22:12,339 --> 00:22:18,429
the soil is the fact that you're not

560
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:19,940
able to fully you know sterilize the

561
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:24,169
soil or clean the media

562
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:25,610
so insects and diseases are I think

563
00:22:24,169 --> 00:22:26,870
you're at higher risk for some of these

564
00:22:25,609 --> 00:22:29,808
things and that's one of the criticisms

565
00:22:26,869 --> 00:22:31,278
that I hear from traditional agriculture

566
00:22:29,808 --> 00:22:33,200
and horticulture with this style of

567
00:22:31,278 --> 00:22:35,298
growing can you talk a little bit about

568
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,860
some of the ways that you guys deal with

569
00:22:35,298 --> 00:22:41,000
that and what you've you know some your

570
00:22:36,859 --> 00:22:44,808
experiences um actually I want to ask

571
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,398
you a question about that but the you

572
00:22:44,808 --> 00:22:48,589
know so I mean don't you know an outdoor

573
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:50,239
farm you know in a greenhouse per se

574
00:22:48,589 --> 00:22:53,538
unless they're in containers you know

575
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:56,179
they're also not you know removing the

576
00:22:53,538 --> 00:23:00,200
entire field right I mean this seems to

577
00:22:56,179 --> 00:23:05,899
be something in respects to a you know a

578
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:08,149
container type of system indoors you

579
00:23:05,898 --> 00:23:09,768
know I guess you know overwintering

580
00:23:08,148 --> 00:23:11,658
outside we don't have that going on

581
00:23:09,769 --> 00:23:16,069
indoors so yes there is definitely that

582
00:23:11,659 --> 00:23:21,200
issue but yeah that is a challenge you

583
00:23:16,069 --> 00:23:22,339
know I think that we don't have the we

584
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,139
don't wipe the slate clean in between

585
00:23:22,339 --> 00:23:26,569
rounds where everything's removed and

586
00:23:24,138 --> 00:23:28,219
sterilized and started over that being

587
00:23:26,569 --> 00:23:28,908
said you do keep your facility very

588
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:31,899
clean

589
00:23:28,909 --> 00:23:34,850
yeahbsolutely yeah you're you know

590
00:23:31,898 --> 00:23:36,888
disinfecting the room just not the soil

591
00:23:34,849 --> 00:23:38,599
and the beds themselves right and I

592
00:23:36,888 --> 00:23:40,490
think that's important it's not it's not

593
00:23:38,599 --> 00:23:42,168
messy when you go into gold leaf you

594
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:43,730
know yeah I mean as much as you know

595
00:23:42,169 --> 00:23:46,669
being able to have soil you know it's

596
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:48,349
not like a laboratory level hydroponics

597
00:23:46,669 --> 00:23:52,038
facility like some of them I I've been

598
00:23:48,349 --> 00:23:54,888
into we still have we're still trying to

599
00:23:52,038 --> 00:23:57,500
promote a very in our environment that

600
00:23:54,888 --> 00:23:59,750
or you know life is proliferated and and

601
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:05,898
you know encouraged you know on the soil

602
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:07,308
level you know robust you know microbial

603
00:24:05,898 --> 00:24:10,729
environments you know around the leaf

604
00:24:07,308 --> 00:24:13,369
surfaces as well so you know sterile is

605
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:15,740
definitely not our end goal at any point

606
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:17,949
but but cleanliness is important

607
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:20,960
absolutely

608
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:24,919
but with with you know with you know

609
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:26,429
perpetually you were using your soil it

610
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:28,769
does force you to

611
00:24:26,429 --> 00:24:31,528
you know really think about your

612
00:24:28,769 --> 00:24:34,440
environment the sustainability of it

613
00:24:31,528 --> 00:24:36,740
over time and your modes of your modes

614
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:40,889
of pest management you know you can't

615
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:42,599
you know you can't apply any type of

616
00:24:40,888 --> 00:24:44,359
product that's also going to damage the

617
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:47,009
the beneficial

618
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:48,959
you know microbes and insects in your

619
00:24:47,009 --> 00:24:51,599
environment so you know we use a lot of

620
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:54,629
beneficial insects for example and you

621
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:58,168
know a horticultural spray that's meant

622
00:24:54,628 --> 00:24:59,730
to knock knock out pathogenic insects is

623
00:24:58,169 --> 00:25:02,220
also going to kill our good guys and so

624
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:02,788
we have to you know you know what I

625
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:04,740
think

626
00:25:02,788 --> 00:25:09,058
you know we're ultimately working

627
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:14,788
towards is is just the the right balance

628
00:25:09,058 --> 00:25:16,528
of you know biology and our rooms that

629
00:25:14,788 --> 00:25:18,210
you know you're never going to eradicate

630
00:25:16,528 --> 00:25:20,359
something all the way but you're gonna

631
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:22,079
you're gonna keep it under under control

632
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:25,798
yeah where there's a good economic

633
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:26,970
threshold and you know and when you kind

634
00:25:25,798 --> 00:25:28,528
of have the right pieces in place you

635
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:30,089
find that you know the gardens would

636
00:25:28,528 --> 00:25:30,659
sort of tend to themselves and do as

637
00:25:30,089 --> 00:25:33,028
mother nature

638
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:34,980
you know intended well when you compare

639
00:25:33,028 --> 00:25:37,339
it to outdoor so the thing about being

640
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:40,499
outdoors in a field is you can still get

641
00:25:37,339 --> 00:25:42,240
you know this these pathogens where they

642
00:25:40,499 --> 00:25:44,460
you know overpopulate they're always

643
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,079
around just like they are at an indoor

644
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:48,899
facility people that say there might

645
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:50,519
free or that I just I don't believe in I

646
00:25:48,898 --> 00:25:53,998
think that's really really hard to

647
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:55,679
achieve and maintain but I think you are

648
00:25:53,999 --> 00:25:59,610
able to maintain them at a low enough

649
00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:01,499
level through a good IPM program to

650
00:25:59,609 --> 00:26:03,839
where they are very manageable yeah and

651
00:26:01,499 --> 00:26:06,058
having those beneficial insects there I

652
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:08,459
think is huge in protecting the plan and

653
00:26:06,058 --> 00:26:11,490
having good microbiology in the soil you

654
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:13,288
know on the leaf surface and the thing

655
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:15,058
about outdoors that's so nice is you

656
00:26:13,288 --> 00:26:16,769
have that diversity of predators that

657
00:26:15,058 --> 00:26:18,269
already are naturalized to that

658
00:26:16,769 --> 00:26:20,548
environment and indoors you just don't

659
00:26:18,269 --> 00:26:22,200
have that so I think the ability for

660
00:26:20,548 --> 00:26:24,210
these pests are really proliferate

661
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:26,220
across a mono crop in an indoor

662
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:28,350
environment is a lot greater and when we

663
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:29,850
talk about greenhouses or like

664
00:26:28,349 --> 00:26:30,409
horticultural operations I've gotten to

665
00:26:29,849 --> 00:26:32,809
see more

666
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:34,910
one of those over the years they are

667
00:26:32,809 --> 00:26:37,099
running you know they may have a

668
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:38,750
thousand different you know a different

669
00:26:37,099 --> 00:26:40,669
varieties of plants and things that all

670
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:42,769
have different insects and pest problems

671
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:44,630
so they feel like the only solution is

672
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:48,740
to spray some pretty heavy pesticides

673
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:49,850
and sterilize everything but well yeah

674
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:51,200
with the bin you know with like for

675
00:26:49,849 --> 00:26:54,500
example our beneficial insects and we

676
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,970
found you know I think everybody's still

677
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:57,859
trying to learn how to you know these

678
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:59,029
world's converging cannabis is so you so

679
00:26:57,859 --> 00:27:00,469
new but you know we found that some

680
00:26:59,029 --> 00:27:02,720
things that work on you know other crops

681
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:04,759
for that same pests aren't really taking

682
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:07,100
hold you know developing breeding

683
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:10,279
populations and things in our rooms and

684
00:27:07,099 --> 00:27:12,319
so it becomes sort of economically

685
00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:13,849
unviable they keep using them yeah I

686
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:17,000
found other things that just sort of

687
00:27:13,849 --> 00:27:18,469
take root and get established and just

688
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,460
become part of the you know the

689
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:23,329
environment and you know so that's

690
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:25,279
that's just been a lot of

691
00:27:23,329 --> 00:27:29,149
experimentation you know yeah do you

692
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:30,680
have a favorite a favorite insect or

693
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:32,120
whatever you like to add your room do

694
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:36,110
you want to share with listeners you

695
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:37,159
know I mean I the Rove beetles right you

696
00:27:36,109 --> 00:27:40,669
know they're they're a little expensive

697
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:42,110
on the front end but we you know III

698
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:45,259
don't remember the last time we

699
00:27:42,109 --> 00:27:46,579
reintroduced him but if you scoop up a

700
00:27:45,259 --> 00:27:48,200
handful of our soil or I mean they even

701
00:27:46,579 --> 00:27:49,730
crawl they crawl everywhere you find

702
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,350
them you know all over your facility

703
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:53,539
well you have them in the in the holy

704
00:27:51,349 --> 00:27:56,569
compost too already covered lowly

705
00:27:53,539 --> 00:27:59,359
cobbles okay yeah so you know that those

706
00:27:56,569 --> 00:28:02,359
you know they seem like apex predators

707
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:04,309
as far as you know you know bugs go on

708
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:06,289
so you know I think you know definitely

709
00:28:04,309 --> 00:28:09,139
if you don't have those established in

710
00:28:06,289 --> 00:28:11,299
your organic soil facility you know

711
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:15,320
those those are those are they're good

712
00:28:11,299 --> 00:28:18,970
one good partners that have in there but

713
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:23,450
but yeah and and just being very

714
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:24,829
prophylactic and proactive right I think

715
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:28,309
kind of wheeling it back to those early

716
00:28:24,829 --> 00:28:32,119
days it was get a problem look for a

717
00:28:28,309 --> 00:28:33,679
solution try it doesn't work go to a

718
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:37,189
bigger gun until your present the

719
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:40,039
nuclear option and and now you know you

720
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:43,519
have to be extremely cognizant about not

721
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:44,990
letting a problem you know flare up so

722
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:46,730
you're constantly screening your rooms

723
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:48,769
or looking constantly screening your

724
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:51,500
rooms and you know one of the hardest

725
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:54,889
disciplines I think is to for example

726
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:57,650
spend money on an IPM for problems you

727
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:59,600
don't have right and yet it's you know

728
00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:01,220
when you go back and study all of you

729
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:03,169
know you know your notes you realize you

730
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:04,279
spent much more once you have a problem

731
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:04,940
and you have to fight it that's a really

732
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:07,579
good point

733
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:08,930
yeah so and then you you don't even

734
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:10,730
think twice about Spain the money you

735
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:12,529
have to do it it's crop loss or it's

736
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:15,500
been you know hundreds or thousands of

737
00:29:12,529 --> 00:29:17,539
dollars on a solution so you know when

738
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:19,130
things are going well you know it seems

739
00:29:17,539 --> 00:29:21,680
a little hard to say oh I really have to

740
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:23,900
you know be disciplined in order my you

741
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:25,370
know hundreds of dollars of beneficial

742
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:27,410
insects and keep introducing them in the

743
00:29:25,369 --> 00:29:30,229
room but then you realize we haven't had

744
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:32,810
a problem in six months or three months

745
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:35,210
and and and so you know I need to keep

746
00:29:32,809 --> 00:29:38,750
up with that you know and I think that

747
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:40,850
once you're able to get from a you know

748
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:43,339
sort of a knockdown or combative you

749
00:29:40,849 --> 00:29:45,619
know yeah cycle into more of a

750
00:29:43,339 --> 00:29:47,779
maintenance cycle that's when you know

751
00:29:45,619 --> 00:29:52,639
it gets actually does get much easier

752
00:29:47,779 --> 00:29:54,049
and you know so less stressful that's

753
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,730
stressful yes you got you got to keep

754
00:29:54,049 --> 00:29:56,720
you got to keep investing in that part

755
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:57,769
of your gardens if you're if you're

756
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,860
getting especially are going to be you

757
00:29:57,769 --> 00:30:03,410
know uh or reusing soil yeah you know

758
00:30:00,859 --> 00:30:05,299
keeping some other plants that are you

759
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:06,529
never never clearing out your mother

760
00:30:05,299 --> 00:30:09,559
room so you're always gonna have you

761
00:30:06,529 --> 00:30:11,509
know some some plant there so so there's

762
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:15,259
there's so many aspects to cultivation

763
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:16,549
besides just growing the plants one of

764
00:30:15,259 --> 00:30:19,279
the things that you and I have talked

765
00:30:16,549 --> 00:30:22,460
about more recently is the whole idea

766
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:24,079
around lean farming oh yeah and I know

767
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:26,029
you have a lot of experience with lean

768
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:30,379
manufacturing and then I was like read

769
00:30:26,029 --> 00:30:31,819
this book Hartman yeah and you've sort

770
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:32,810
of embraced that and your facility

771
00:30:31,819 --> 00:30:34,909
little bit key talk a little bit about

772
00:30:32,809 --> 00:30:36,169
that experience well yeah I wouldn't I

773
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:37,040
don't know if I would you might be

774
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:38,390
giving me too much credit

775
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:39,950
i I've always been you know interested

776
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:41,120
in the subject and is just always

777
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:43,130
thinking about you know writing it

778
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:46,189
random production business you know

779
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:49,490
looking for for the right strategies you

780
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:53,000
know I I've always you know been very

781
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:55,940
interested in how how to sort of take

782
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,380
that these methods that work you know

783
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:59,750
I've given you know like Toyota there's

784
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:02,090
great advantage over its rivals and yeah

785
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:03,500
and apply that but I always had a hard

786
00:31:02,089 --> 00:31:05,839
time connecting the dots you know it

787
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:07,519
always kind of stopped ideas made sense

788
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:10,490
on paper and so when you gave me that

789
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:12,109
book by Ben art man there it is you know

790
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:14,210
somebody somebody smarter than me

791
00:31:12,109 --> 00:31:15,769
finally connected the dots at Evan you

792
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:19,360
know so we've been going through a

793
00:31:15,769 --> 00:31:22,660
process at our place of removing waste

794
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:25,429
you know and then just really analyzing

795
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:30,230
doing a lot of deep reflection on on

796
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:32,870
every step every touch is it necessary

797
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:34,519
does it add value or does it not and

798
00:31:32,869 --> 00:31:35,989
it's amazing once you sort of take

799
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:37,369
inventory of that you know how many

800
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:38,690
things you do in a day that aren't

801
00:31:37,369 --> 00:31:42,229
adding value to you know to your

802
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:45,529
customer so why are you doing it you

803
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:47,420
know and so it's it's a transfer

804
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:48,859
transformation process that I think is

805
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:51,710
going to be going on for a long time but

806
00:31:48,859 --> 00:31:53,649
I you know I think it's it's really the

807
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:56,059
right direction

808
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:59,900
especially as this industry becomes

809
00:31:56,059 --> 00:32:02,000
highly competitive you know now you know

810
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:03,680
the the prices of cannabis here in

811
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,069
Washington State and you know from what

812
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:10,190
we've seen in other states you know are

813
00:32:07,069 --> 00:32:12,409
falling I'm getting much closer to you

814
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:17,360
know representing their manufacturing

815
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:19,759
costs not you know this sort of artifact

816
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:21,979
of what they used to cost in the medical

817
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:25,400
market or on the street before yeah

818
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:26,110
you know I mean we grow some of the you

819
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,640
know

820
00:32:26,109 --> 00:32:31,519
highest in cannabis in this market but

821
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:32,750
you know an eighth of our flower doesn't

822
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:36,019
cost much more than what I was paying

823
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:38,059
for you know in college 20 years ago oh

824
00:32:36,019 --> 00:32:40,119
my god is at work you know so you have

825
00:32:38,059 --> 00:32:42,429
to be efficient and there's

826
00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:43,809
only a fat literally clear you're not

827
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:46,630
taking that money home it's the

828
00:32:43,809 --> 00:32:48,879
government without the customers paying

829
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:52,240
the same thing we were 20 years ago you

830
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:55,270
know yeah we get a bit of that so yeah

831
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:57,039
you know it's you know it really you

832
00:32:55,269 --> 00:33:00,629
know I think if you're not running a

833
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:02,889
lien operation a very smart operation

834
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:05,290
then it's hard to make money right now

835
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:09,550
and I think I think you know that's just

836
00:33:05,289 --> 00:33:12,220
the reality and yeah it is a slow

837
00:33:09,549 --> 00:33:15,669
process I've been doing it at my my farm

838
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:17,230
you know getting an employees to work on

839
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:18,400
paying attention to what they're seeing

840
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:21,130
around you know how we can keep the

841
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:22,840
property cleaner and how we can improve

842
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:25,030
the our processes because a lot of what

843
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:26,199
we do is just so time-consuming and I

844
00:33:25,029 --> 00:33:28,000
know we I know we can do a better job

845
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,380
and I know we haven't even thought of

846
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,660
all the ways we can do a better job so

847
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:33,460
it's one of those things it's not it's

848
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:35,170
not so much an end goal as it is just a

849
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:37,870
journey right and I'm really I'm really

850
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:40,390
enjoying it it's definitely changed the

851
00:33:37,869 --> 00:33:42,519
way we run our farm and my and our

852
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:44,560
business and I'm glad that it's you know

853
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:46,509
I thinking about its Kaizen it's that

854
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:48,429
that improvement you know that 1%

855
00:33:46,509 --> 00:33:49,509
improvement you know it's not you're

856
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:52,539
never gonna get there they're just gonna

857
00:33:49,509 --> 00:33:53,859
try to constantly you know carve away at

858
00:33:52,539 --> 00:33:56,730
what doesn't need to be there and

859
00:33:53,859 --> 00:34:00,369
towards this this purity of you know

860
00:33:56,730 --> 00:34:02,410
pure value ray which is more of a you

861
00:34:00,369 --> 00:34:03,459
know something to aspire to them

862
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:06,850
probably something you've ever actually

863
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:09,250
achieved but you know in that pursuit

864
00:34:06,849 --> 00:34:11,409
you end up becoming you know becoming

865
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:14,320
better at what you do and oh yeah you

866
00:34:11,409 --> 00:34:16,480
know and and you know one of the one of

867
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,820
the traps I think we've seen like in you

868
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,670
know probably all farming and it's

869
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:23,140
starting to apply to cannabis is that

870
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:26,010
you know one direction people take it is

871
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:29,379
to just grow larger and larger yeah and

872
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:31,960
yet you'll see large-scale operations

873
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:34,539
that have taken on a ton of debt to get

874
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:37,340
there not necessarily being more

875
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:39,739
profitable right

876
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:41,510
and that seems that seems interesting

877
00:34:39,739 --> 00:34:47,139
right where's that economy of scale but

878
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:49,550
I think you know these type of lean

879
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:52,639
methods can be applied to a very small

880
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:54,019
operation or a large operation yeah but

881
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:55,190
either way you need to you know you need

882
00:34:54,019 --> 00:34:57,500
to be very disciplined about how you're

883
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:59,119
running know for sure and I know for me

884
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:00,559
I've been a lot happier since we've

885
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:03,500
started implementing this stuff because

886
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:05,119
the mental cost of all of this waste was

887
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:07,400
just weigh me down like walking around

888
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:09,019
and seeing project after project that

889
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:11,869
need to be completed or just mess after

890
00:35:09,019 --> 00:35:13,969
mess that we left behind it's like it

891
00:35:11,869 --> 00:35:16,219
was exhausting yeah so just getting the

892
00:35:13,969 --> 00:35:18,409
stuff off the property it was so nice

893
00:35:16,219 --> 00:35:22,549
and it's still it's a constant battle

894
00:35:18,409 --> 00:35:23,480
yeah it's been great so changing

895
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:26,420
directions we've been talking about

896
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:30,230
cultivation so far but as you well know

897
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:32,420
that's just one one aspect of cannabis

898
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:34,010
cultivation I mean there's you could be

899
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:36,260
the best grower in the world right now

900
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:38,900
here in Washington State and still be

901
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:42,800
failing just because there's so much

902
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:44,990
more to creating a brand and a market

903
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,880
share and interest in your product and

904
00:35:44,989 --> 00:35:51,169
keep I want to talk a little bit about

905
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:52,970
your sort of your company philosophy and

906
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:54,349
the morals that you guys stand for but

907
00:35:52,969 --> 00:35:57,230
before we do can we talk a little bit

908
00:35:54,349 --> 00:35:59,360
about branding and marketing aspect of

909
00:35:57,230 --> 00:36:02,329
things right um yeah you know I mean

910
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:03,769
it's you know the if everything is

911
00:36:02,329 --> 00:36:05,480
important now and you know it's all tied

912
00:36:03,769 --> 00:36:07,099
together to those two things are really

913
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:08,690
close for you what you guys are doing

914
00:36:07,099 --> 00:36:10,219
yeah absolutely you know I mean I think

915
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:14,389
we were a little bit ahead of the curve

916
00:36:10,219 --> 00:36:15,909
in just realizing that you know cannabis

917
00:36:14,389 --> 00:36:20,359
is gonna kind of turn from this sort of

918
00:36:15,909 --> 00:36:22,549
you know anonymous you know anonymous

919
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:23,980
commodity to you know something that was

920
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:26,480
going to you know look a lot more like

921
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:28,610
like products you see on the shelves and

922
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,800
other industries so you know kind of

923
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:32,660
early on we stuck our neck out and came

924
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:36,050
up with the name gold leaf and started

925
00:36:32,659 --> 00:36:37,549
branding our product and at the time and

926
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:38,720
say the Medical dispensaries you know

927
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:41,960
you usually go in it was kind of like a

928
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:44,839
like purchasing bulk supplies you know

929
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:47,059
and you know at an old general store and

930
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:48,380
you have these jars and here's some some

931
00:36:47,059 --> 00:36:49,909
strains you

932
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:52,849
necessary know who grew them or anything

933
00:36:49,909 --> 00:36:55,308
like that yeah and so we came out kind

934
00:36:52,849 --> 00:36:57,019
of with a jar with our logo on it and it

935
00:36:55,309 --> 00:36:58,700
said you know this is gold leaf weed you

936
00:36:57,018 --> 00:37:00,108
know you know for better or worse this

937
00:36:58,699 --> 00:37:02,808
is this is where it's coming from

938
00:37:00,108 --> 00:37:05,150
yeah I know and so we we kind of rode

939
00:37:02,809 --> 00:37:06,259
that into you know into the the market

940
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:09,139
and now of course that's how all

941
00:37:06,259 --> 00:37:12,650
products are sold but it's it's really

942
00:37:09,139 --> 00:37:14,719
important you know I think because now

943
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:16,309
in Washington for example you know all

944
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:19,429
the products need to be sealed and kept

945
00:37:16,309 --> 00:37:22,880
behind a you know behind a glass counter

946
00:37:19,429 --> 00:37:27,048
or behind the bar so for the customers

947
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:30,200
you need to really develop a trust with

948
00:37:27,048 --> 00:37:32,538
them and and so you know having strong

949
00:37:30,199 --> 00:37:34,818
you know branding and marketing to kind

950
00:37:32,539 --> 00:37:37,660
of reinforce that those company values

951
00:37:34,818 --> 00:37:40,909
is is essential and you can be

952
00:37:37,659 --> 00:37:44,210
incredible grower you can have the most

953
00:37:40,909 --> 00:37:45,920
coveted strains and it can just fall

954
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:49,699
flat for you because you don't have that

955
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:51,170
piece in place which yeah I know a lot

956
00:37:49,699 --> 00:37:52,759
of growers in Washington right now our

957
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:55,338
producer processors as they're called

958
00:37:52,759 --> 00:37:57,230
here are struggling to get into new

959
00:37:55,338 --> 00:37:59,630
stores and get their product sold where

960
00:37:57,230 --> 00:38:01,338
as I know you guys can't even keep up

961
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:03,230
right now with the number of stores and

962
00:38:01,338 --> 00:38:05,000
people that want you and want to carry

963
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:07,940
your product and a lot of that is due to

964
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:11,838
customer demand people have come this

965
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:14,630
you know signify certain traits with the

966
00:38:11,838 --> 00:38:15,980
brand gold leaf and I think you know I

967
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:18,019
won't touch on that some more but I

968
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:20,000
think such a big part of that is you're

969
00:38:18,018 --> 00:38:21,199
the culture you've created there you

970
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,750
know and the community that you guys

971
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:26,808
have and can you talk a little bit about

972
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:28,039
sort of so I know I have a little

973
00:38:26,809 --> 00:38:29,690
background here it's kind of unfair but

974
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:31,130
I know you guys are for the started off

975
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:33,139
like a bunch of Hawaiian guys yeah

976
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:35,599
coming out of what Kauai I think you

977
00:38:33,139 --> 00:38:37,219
said yeah you know I mean I'm for most

978
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:40,700
of our you know all of our growers are

979
00:38:37,219 --> 00:38:43,159
from kawaii and okay yeah we you know we

980
00:38:40,699 --> 00:38:45,318
have a we have a it's you know we kind

981
00:38:43,159 --> 00:38:46,670

989
00:39:00,539 --> 00:39:03,750
what what what that what does that mean

990

you know the word has a lot of different

991
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:09,929
meanings but it means love you know and

992
00:39:05,369 --> 00:39:11,969
and so just from the love of the plant

993
00:39:09,929 --> 00:39:13,769
to you know the love of you know each

994
00:39:11,969 --> 00:39:16,230
other the family you work with and in

995
00:39:13,769 --> 00:39:18,480
your community and you know growing up

996
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:21,530
in a you know unique place like Hawaii

997
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:25,740
you had a real tight communities yeah

998
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:28,560
there was a social responsibility and

999
00:39:25,739 --> 00:39:31,309
that sort of you know manage how

1000
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:33,539
everybody interacted with each other and

1001
00:39:31,309 --> 00:39:36,179
you know it just seems to you know it's

1002
00:39:33,539 --> 00:39:37,529
just how we live our life and organic

1003
00:39:36,179 --> 00:39:41,250
growing kind of falls in line with that

1004
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:42,720
as well and so you know that's that's

1005
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:45,570
sort of how we run our think our company

1006
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:47,879
internally and it it is struck a chord

1007
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:49,800
with with people up here you know yeah

1008
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:52,079
it sounds really you know it sounds

1009
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:53,850
cliche but you know there's people want

1010
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:56,219
to know the story behind the brand and

1011
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:59,159
you know the yeah I think it's important

1012
00:39:56,219 --> 00:40:00,779
yeah it is and it's not you know it did

1013
00:39:59,159 --> 00:40:03,690
I think there's substance to that you

1014
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:06,269
know I mean people you know you you have

1015
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:07,740
this dollar in your wallet to spend and

1016
00:40:06,269 --> 00:40:10,110
you can choose how you want to spend it

1017
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:11,579
you know there's some folks with hate

1018
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:13,860
give me the most potent weed for the

1019
00:40:11,579 --> 00:40:15,599
cheapest amount of money I can spend and

1020
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:16,950
we've you know there's nothing wrong

1021
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:19,289
with that but that's not the customer

1022
00:40:16,949 --> 00:40:20,909
that seems to you know be supporting our

1023
00:40:19,289 --> 00:40:23,309
business and you know there's other ones

1024
00:40:20,909 --> 00:40:24,929
who say you know it's a good product but

1025
00:40:23,309 --> 00:40:28,349
also to I just love the way that you

1026
00:40:24,929 --> 00:40:30,659
know you you guys you know run your

1027
00:40:28,349 --> 00:40:32,420
business you know are good responsible

1028
00:40:30,659 --> 00:40:35,759
members of the community you give back

1029
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:37,680
you you grow things responsibly when you

1030
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:39,840
you know there's no rule says you have

1031
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:42,329
to but you know we know we trust we

1032
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:44,960
trust your cultivation practices we know

1033
00:40:42,329 --> 00:40:48,210
you take care of your your employees and

1034
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:50,570
and so you know at the end of the day I

1035
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:53,030
mean that that adds up to to those

1036
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:55,400
those sales you know she's important so

1037
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:58,070
yeah and your guys are passionate about

1038
00:40:55,400 --> 00:41:00,320
what they're doing I mean well you know

1039
00:40:58,070 --> 00:41:02,539
so my growers you know and I got to give

1040
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:04,190
them credit because you know it it all

1041
00:41:02,539 --> 00:41:05,630
starts with them I mean without them

1042
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:07,670
then the rest of the business is you

1043
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:09,170
know there's no foundation and and

1044
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:11,300
they're almost all you know brothers and

1045
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:13,430
cousins they grew up on this really you

1046
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:17,690
know on a farm in a really small town

1047
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:19,909
called Koloa an island of quite and you

1048
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:21,769
know they grew up growing vegetables you

1049
00:41:19,909 --> 00:41:23,059
know sustenance farming they would sell

1050
00:41:21,769 --> 00:41:24,829
there you know they go with their folks

1051
00:41:23,059 --> 00:41:26,179
down at the farmers market and sell what

1052
00:41:24,829 --> 00:41:27,409
they didn't need and then you know

1053
00:41:26,179 --> 00:41:28,909
that's that's where they came from where

1054
00:41:27,409 --> 00:41:31,069
they were really relying on their land

1055
00:41:28,909 --> 00:41:35,089
you know to provide for their families

1056
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:39,610
and so you know now you know they've

1057
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:42,050
kind of you know migrated up here and

1058
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:43,760
you know the fact they're sort of able

1059
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:44,960
to do that but in this in this different

1060
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:48,800
market I think is something they're very

1061
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:50,420
proud of and and it's and it you know

1062
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,220
shows in the product you know with but

1063
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:56,180
they take a certain pride in the gardens

1064
00:41:52,219 --> 00:41:58,039
and I know this is a cultivation science

1065
00:41:56,179 --> 00:41:59,989
podcast but you know there's just

1066
00:41:58,039 --> 00:42:02,480
there's this one thing I haven't been

1067
00:41:59,989 --> 00:42:04,699
able to to sort of like quantify

1068
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,500
scientifically and it's it's you know

1069
00:42:04,699 --> 00:42:11,029
just this love and this passion forfor

1070
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:13,969
being for your work and it just it it

1071
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:17,870
shows up in the flavor and it just shows

1072
00:42:13,969 --> 00:42:18,980
up in the product at the end and so you

1073
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:20,089
know I don't know how to replicate that

1074
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:22,309
I just know we have something really

1075
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:24,440
special and we're just trying to let the

1076
00:42:22,309 --> 00:42:26,480
world you know kind of see it and you

1077
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:29,900
know decide if that's that's that's for

1078
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:31,579
them you know yeah I mean one thing we

1079
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:34,789
haven't mentioned either is that your

1080
00:42:31,579 --> 00:42:37,369
facility is fairly far south of Seattle

1081
00:42:34,789 --> 00:42:40,670
so a lot of the guys live in Seattle

1082
00:42:37,369 --> 00:42:43,159
even I think in North Seattle in some

1083
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:46,670
cases yeah and are driving all the way

1084
00:42:43,159 --> 00:42:47,750
down to the facility which is you know

1085
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:49,880
how many miles is that

1086
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:52,280
well yeah it's in Olympia Washington and

1087
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:55,190
you know it's about a 60 mile drive each

1088
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:57,560
way and I we have most of our employees

1089
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:58,260
and they make that drive both ways every

1090
00:42:57,559 --> 00:43:03,269
day

1091
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:05,460
traffic they spent hours there getting

1092
00:43:03,269 --> 00:43:07,199
up and you know crazy hours oh yeah

1093
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:09,210
definitely just for the opportunity to

1094
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:10,799
work and be a part of this community

1095
00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:12,929
yeah and and you know everybody has a

1096
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:15,390
shared shared you know sense that we're

1097
00:43:12,929 --> 00:43:17,219
building something special and yeah you

1098
00:43:15,389 --> 00:43:19,440
know you know to come from a small place

1099
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:22,230
and be able to make your mark and you

1100
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:24,000
know going to these stores and and you

1101
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:25,260
know hear the stories that you know

1102
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,900
there was there was people that were you

1103
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:29,700
know genuinely had their their day or

1104
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:30,990
their lives improved by you know by your

1105
00:43:29,699 --> 00:43:32,639
products I mean that's that's the kind

1106
00:43:30,989 --> 00:43:35,969
of thing that it makes that drive worth

1107
00:43:32,639 --> 00:43:37,650
it you know and so so yeah we're just

1108
00:43:35,969 --> 00:43:39,480
blessed and and you know wouldn't do

1109
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:43,230
anything else so what are some of the

1110
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:45,630
things that you do at gold leaf you know

1111
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:50,010
for or with your employees that help

1112
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:52,559
build that sense of community yeah we I

1113
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:54,180
mean even even something as simple as

1114
00:43:52,559 --> 00:43:56,279
you know on Friday we you know we all

1115
00:43:54,179 --> 00:43:59,759
stop work a few hours early and barbecue

1116
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:01,410
and it's just become this tradition you

1117
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:03,840
know that I don't know how it started

1118
00:44:01,409 --> 00:44:06,000
just as long as I can remember we've you

1119
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:09,590
know we break a little really on Friday

1120
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:11,820
and we everybody has a potluck and and

1121
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:14,730
yeah that's kind of a hawaiian thing you

1122
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:17,960
just you know everything you know kind

1123
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:21,420
of you know orbits around food and

1124
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:23,130
community and and it's just yeah it's a

1125
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:25,829
special time where we're able to you

1126
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:27,269
know just reflect and and you know have

1127
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:31,710
your team together and something that's

1128
00:44:27,269 --> 00:44:33,329
not work related but well yeah i mean

1129
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:35,280
it's it you know it's the barbecue

1130
00:44:33,329 --> 00:44:37,650
everything you know it's it's such a

1131
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:39,269
small thing but yet i think it just

1132
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:41,010
helps everybody remember that like yeah

1133
00:44:39,269 --> 00:44:43,079

1135
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:45,789
know

1136
00:44:43,659 --> 00:44:49,779
or together so when I first started

1137
00:44:45,789 --> 00:44:51,429
running kiss we would have staff

1138
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:52,900
meetings we're not all working at the

1139

1140
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:55,840
of barbecues and things but we're

1141
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:57,099
working on more team-building events and

1142
00:44:55,840 --> 00:45:00,430
those opportunities to be together

1143
00:44:57,099 --> 00:45:01,719
outside of the you know outside of the

1144
00:45:00,429 --> 00:45:04,659
workplace and not talking about work

1145
00:45:01,719 --> 00:45:07,599
like my farm managers birthday was last

1146
00:45:04,659 --> 00:45:10,089
night and you know over half the staff

1147
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:11,349
was there you know other people the

1148
00:45:10,090 --> 00:45:12,640
guests we're leaving in like the staff

1149
00:45:11,349 --> 00:45:14,319
was there hanging out because they enjoy

1150
00:45:12,639 --> 00:45:16,089
each other's company and like some of

1151
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:18,400
the some of the people have taken trips

1152
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:19,900
to Iceland together or live together or

1153
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:22,360
have moved across the country and it's

1154
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:24,910
like those moments at community I think

1155
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:26,470
are so amazing and when I first started

1156
00:45:24,909 --> 00:45:27,909
looking staff meetings I was like oh my

1157
00:45:26,469 --> 00:45:29,259
gosh this is cut account I was

1158
00:45:27,909 --> 00:45:31,210
calculating out how much this is costing

1159
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:32,380
me per hour that we're just sitting

1160
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:34,710
there and you know people are asking

1161
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:37,300
questions and I'm like 20 man hours yeah

1162
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:39,809
yeah like this is a lot of money that we

1163
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:43,300
could be spent doing other stuff but as

1164
00:45:39,809 --> 00:45:44,829
I matured as the leader or as a business

1165
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:46,450
owner I realized just how important this

1166
00:45:44,829 --> 00:45:48,670
aspect was that people feel like they're

1167
00:45:46,449 --> 00:45:51,099
being heard that people have time

1168
00:45:48,670 --> 00:45:53,889
together that's not spent being you know

1169
00:45:51,099 --> 00:45:55,989
stressed or working and that everyone

1170
00:45:53,889 --> 00:45:58,629
gets along and likes each other is so

1171
00:45:55,989 --> 00:46:00,729
important and work environments can go a

1172
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:01,900
lot of different ways oh yeah I mean I

1173
00:46:00,730 --> 00:46:03,280
know there's a lot of places where it's

1174
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:05,050
like I don't want to see you till Monday

1175
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:07,960
morning I can't get out of there fast

1176
00:46:05,050 --> 00:46:10,240
enough um yeah but uh but yeah you

1177
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:12,849
nailed it Ted I mean it's it's um I

1178
00:46:10,239 --> 00:46:15,639
think it comes down to a sense of

1179
00:46:12,849 --> 00:46:18,969
purpose right and and like you know you

1180
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:21,250
have not every job at gold leaf is you

1181
00:46:18,969 --> 00:46:24,909
know is as glamorous as the others but I

1182
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:28,000
think that it's it's important to you

1183
00:46:24,909 --> 00:46:30,579
know you know sort of develop that and

1184
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:34,329
everybody that says you know it's like

1185
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:37,239
there there's this you know quote for

1186
00:46:34,329 --> 00:46:41,559
the stonemasons and it says you know we

1187
00:46:37,239 --> 00:46:45,609
cut humble stone must not forget we're

1188
00:46:41,559 --> 00:46:47,529
building cathedrals yeah it's like you

1189
00:46:45,610 --> 00:46:48,700
know even if you're just trimming and I

1190
00:46:47,530 --> 00:46:51,370
totally butcher that quote by the way

1191
00:46:48,699 --> 00:46:53,169
but you know the whether you're trimming

1192
00:46:51,369 --> 00:46:54,429
or you're packaging or you're delivery

1193
00:46:53,170 --> 00:46:56,050
and you know everybody realized

1194
00:46:54,429 --> 00:46:59,199
is that this is all part of that you

1195
00:46:56,050 --> 00:47:00,339
know that that customer experience and I

1196
00:46:59,199 --> 00:47:02,169
think you know there's so much to be

1197
00:47:00,338 --> 00:47:05,139
learned from from every person who works

1198
00:47:02,170 --> 00:47:06,789
there right like you and I will you know

1199
00:47:05,139 --> 00:47:08,828
wear a lot of hats or running our

1200
00:47:06,789 --> 00:47:10,358
businesses you know we're not always

1201
00:47:08,829 --> 00:47:11,859
down in the trenches you know at least

1202
00:47:10,358 --> 00:47:13,929
for myself I should say you know I can't

1203
00:47:11,858 --> 00:47:15,338
you know not always you know there's

1204
00:47:13,929 --> 00:47:17,259
there's weeks I'm not even in the

1205
00:47:15,338 --> 00:47:20,170
gardens as much anymore because I'm have

1206
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:23,319
other things to attend to and and you

1207
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:24,639
know fine you know the person with you

1208
00:47:23,318 --> 00:47:26,980
know maybe one of the most homeless job

1209
00:47:24,639 --> 00:47:29,338
you know at our at our farm will have

1210
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:31,960
insights into that part of the process

1211
00:47:29,338 --> 00:47:34,509
that I wouldn't be able to come up with

1212
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:36,639
you know and allowing them empowering

1213
00:47:34,510 --> 00:47:38,079
them to say hey you know okay why don't

1214
00:47:36,639 --> 00:47:39,969
you make this approvement this is about

1215
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:41,289
me telling you how to do a job it's you

1216
00:47:39,969 --> 00:47:43,598
know it's me find the right people who

1217
00:47:41,289 --> 00:47:43,989
want to improve this company in any way

1218
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:46,240
they can

1219
00:47:43,989 --> 00:47:48,939
yeah and and so giving them some some

1220
00:47:46,239 --> 00:47:51,039
Liberty which he knows takes a certain

1221
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:52,690
amount of trust and but you find I think

1222
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:54,489
you find overall that when people do

1223
00:47:52,690 --> 00:47:56,079
that you know that gives them a sense of

1224
00:47:54,489 --> 00:47:59,169
purpose say wow I've improved this

1225
00:47:56,079 --> 00:48:02,500
product I've helped my company everybody

1226
00:47:59,170 --> 00:48:04,240
benefited from it I think that that's

1227
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:06,099
sort of really easy yeah you had told me

1228
00:48:04,239 --> 00:48:07,509
another time we're talking about one of

1229
00:48:06,099 --> 00:48:08,650
your trimmers you kind of told me a

1230
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:11,980
story around that you want to share that

1231
00:48:08,650 --> 00:48:13,480
with the listeners was that which one

1232
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:14,490
was Adam yeah he's probably probably has

1233
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:16,838
to do with you know

1234
00:48:14,489 --> 00:48:18,639

1236
00:48:18,639 --> 00:48:23,259
offered him other positions in the

1237
00:48:20,139 --> 00:48:25,900
company yeah but well yeah I mean I've

1238
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:27,760
had a you know an awesome kid he's been

1239
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:30,280

1240
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:32,380
and years and you know I you know he's

1241
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:34,119

move in to like you know different jobs

1243
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:43,298
but he just kind of has this this old

1244
00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:45,369
soul in this biz oh this you know desire

1245
00:48:43,298 --> 00:48:48,489
this this how should I say this affinity

1246
00:48:45,369 --> 00:48:49,809
for it kind of you know there's one good

1247
00:48:48,489 --> 00:48:51,729
craftsmanship you know and this one

1248
00:48:49,809 --> 00:48:53,440
little thing he does he takes his one

1249
00:48:51,730 --> 00:48:55,150
job of trimming which you know if you

1250
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:57,429
you know trimming for the cannabis

1251
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:58,869
industry is you know some people think

1252
00:48:57,429 --> 00:48:59,949
it's like dishwashing in the restaurant

1253
00:48:58,869 --> 00:49:03,099
industry like it's where you got to

1254
00:48:59,949 --> 00:49:04,419
start and yet you know he takes so much

1255
00:49:03,099 --> 00:49:06,280
pride in

1256
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:08,800
trimming a perfect flower and I think

1257
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:10,960
you know what he's told me is that you

1258
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:13,930
know I mean these growers they put in so

1259
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:15,940
much time and energy from from taking a

1260
00:49:13,929 --> 00:49:18,819
clone and all the way through it's it's

1261
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:21,429
growing life and you know the harvesting

1262
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:23,410
and that the curing and you know it's

1263
00:49:21,429 --> 00:49:26,710
his job to to give it that final

1264
00:49:23,409 --> 00:49:28,119
manicure that the you know that's you

1265

1266
00:49:28,119 --> 00:49:32,769
that pride he hasn't that one simple

1267
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:34,599
task really embodies oh you know just

1268
00:49:32,769 --> 00:49:37,239
how you know how we try to view

1269
00:49:34,599 --> 00:49:39,880
everything we do so it's great and you

1270
00:49:37,239 --> 00:49:42,789
know he he might be a trimmer for ever

1271
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:43,510
and you know it's it's but he enjoys

1272
00:49:42,789 --> 00:49:45,369
what he does

1273
00:49:43,510 --> 00:49:48,210
you know he's absolutely absolutely you

1274
00:49:45,369 --> 00:49:50,529
know you he has purpose in his work and

1275
00:49:48,210 --> 00:49:52,000
and he's quite talented that he's good

1276
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:54,100
at what he's doing absolutely any one

1277
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,860
simple task and I put in well do it now

1278
00:49:54,099 --> 00:49:59,380
I said you know I'm gonna continue to

1279
00:49:55,860 --> 00:50:01,210
promote you but you could still be a

1280
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:03,970
trimmer right because he's earned that I

1281
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:06,909
want to take care of folks but if his

1282
00:50:03,969 --> 00:50:07,449
you know calling is to do that one final

1283
00:50:06,909 --> 00:50:09,219
detail

1284
00:50:07,449 --> 00:50:10,629
it's like detailing a car before you put

1285
00:50:09,219 --> 00:50:12,189
it on the lot you know it might not

1286
00:50:10,630 --> 00:50:14,110
sound as cool as the guy engineering the

1287
00:50:12,190 --> 00:50:15,579
car but you know at the end of the day

1288
00:50:14,110 --> 00:50:17,410
that customer is gonna want to see a

1289
00:50:15,579 --> 00:50:19,539
nice shiny car and that might be what

1290
00:50:17,409 --> 00:50:21,879
makes him purchase it yeah and he

1291
00:50:19,539 --> 00:50:24,150
understands that and I think that's sort

1292
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:26,200
of that's that's definitely a you know

1293
00:50:24,150 --> 00:50:29,039
example for how we try to do everything

1294
00:50:26,199 --> 00:50:32,469
there so let's talk a little bit about

1295
00:50:29,039 --> 00:50:35,590
what where we are yeah and sort of a

1296
00:50:32,469 --> 00:50:37,839
little bit about the coffee and some of

1297
00:50:35,590 --> 00:50:40,210
your products and how you guys brand

1298
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:42,970
your your stuff for listeners yeah I

1299
00:50:40,210 --> 00:50:45,880
mean the where do I start so yeah we're

1300
00:50:42,969 --> 00:50:48,399
here you know origins coffee shop it's

1301
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:51,970
adjacent origins recreational cannabis

1302
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:53,829
shop in Redmond Washington we've worked

1303
00:50:51,969 --> 00:50:55,209
at them for a long time and we love that

1304
00:50:53,829 --> 00:50:59,190
they sort of are thinking outside the

1305
00:50:55,210 --> 00:51:02,230
box with how people are interacting with

1306
00:50:59,190 --> 00:51:06,480
cannabis as a whole and with the brands

1307
00:51:02,230 --> 00:51:08,010
in general you know and it's a

1308
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:10,289
it takes a little bit of creative

1309
00:51:08,010 --> 00:51:12,870
thinking to be you know to making this

1310
00:51:10,289 --> 00:51:15,809
market so so you guys partnered on this

1311
00:51:12,869 --> 00:51:17,699
this coffee mm-hmm and can you talk a

1312
00:51:15,809 --> 00:51:19,650
little bit about where we're starting

1313
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:22,019
you know at the actual origin of the

1314
00:51:19,650 --> 00:51:25,950
coffee itself yeah why you're why you're

1315
00:51:22,019 --> 00:51:27,360
doing it yeah I mean you know it's the

1316
00:51:25,949 --> 00:51:31,289
two things we consume the most of his

1317
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:34,890
coffee as well get in businesses both

1318
00:51:31,289 --> 00:51:36,119
but uh you know I was I've been thinking

1319
00:51:34,889 --> 00:51:40,949
for a long time I mean I drink a lot of

1320
00:51:36,119 --> 00:51:43,139
coffee and there's a lot of restrictions

1321
00:51:40,949 --> 00:51:44,879
on how I can you know really market and

1322
00:51:43,139 --> 00:51:46,259
advertise my cannabis brand you know

1323
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:48,990
just sort of what's sort of socially

1324
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:51,990
responsible and and you know it's it's

1325
00:51:48,989 --> 00:51:54,509
an adult product and even the state set

1326
00:51:51,989 --> 00:51:57,989
some limitations on how how where we can

1327
00:51:54,510 --> 00:51:59,430
advertise obviously I'm thinking about

1328
00:51:57,989 --> 00:52:02,219
our brand you know eventually moving

1329
00:51:59,429 --> 00:52:04,799
into you know possibly other states you

1330
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:06,779
know internationally one day so how do I

1331
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:09,480
begin to export that you know if I can

1332
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:11,640
ship my my products across state lines

1333
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:13,139
you know yeah and so the coffee just

1334
00:52:11,639 --> 00:52:15,559
seemed to be something that sort of

1335
00:52:13,139 --> 00:52:21,199
embodied a lot of you know similar

1336
00:52:15,559 --> 00:52:24,449
similar values so we partnered with a

1337
00:52:21,199 --> 00:52:28,079
roastery on the Big Island and there

1338
00:52:24,449 --> 00:52:30,779
they work with a cooperative of Kona

1339
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:33,840
coffee farmers other coffee farmers in

1340
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:39,000
Hawaii you know small farms small family

1341
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:41,519
farms organic same values we have and so

1342
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:43,739
hopefully now you know if you get by or

1343
00:52:41,519 --> 00:52:46,289
you know get a bag of cold gold leaf

1344
00:52:43,739 --> 00:52:49,109
coffee and it's excellent too and you

1345
00:52:46,289 --> 00:52:50,309
know we made sure that we made sure hey

1346
00:52:49,110 --> 00:52:51,750
if we're gonna put the name on it's got

1347
00:52:50,309 --> 00:52:53,039
to be really good you know and and so

1348
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:55,769
hopefully you know you maybe you try the

1349
00:52:53,039 --> 00:52:57,690
coffee and you say wow know what's

1350
00:52:55,769 --> 00:53:00,690
behind this brand in psychology if they

1351
00:52:57,690 --> 00:53:03,420
also grow they also grow herb and maybe

1352
00:53:00,690 --> 00:53:04,710
I'll check that out so just a different

1353
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:06,480
way of thinking about the brand as a

1354
00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:08,190
whole you know eventually perhaps it

1355
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:10,050
expands beyond just cannabis it's more

1356
00:53:08,190 --> 00:53:12,760
of a lifestyle and

1357
00:53:10,050 --> 00:53:16,150
culture yeah and then you guys are known

1358
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:19,119
for your flower yeah that's really

1359
00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:21,430
what's you sort of staked your mark on

1360
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:24,849
but you also produce other products as

1361
00:53:21,429 --> 00:53:26,259
well yes so beyond the flower you're

1362
00:53:24,849 --> 00:53:27,820
also he talked a little bit about the

1363
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:28,930
lyric ana gars and some of the other

1364
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:31,359
products you've created sort of

1365
00:53:28,929 --> 00:53:32,949
diversify in this market yeah so we you

1366
00:53:31,358 --> 00:53:35,230
know we you know we start off pretty

1367
00:53:32,949 --> 00:53:36,759
much strictly selling flower we

1368
00:53:35,230 --> 00:53:39,099
partnered eventually with the

1369
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:43,020
concentrate maker polar ice tracks and

1370
00:53:39,099 --> 00:53:47,650
we do solvent free concentrate so hash

1371
00:53:43,019 --> 00:53:48,880
rosin and that's been really great you

1372
00:53:47,650 --> 00:53:51,910
know we've been winning some awards for

1373
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:55,539
that it's just a very pure process that

1374
00:53:51,909 --> 00:53:57,279
involves no chemistry and so we figure

1375
00:53:55,539 --> 00:53:58,929
why are you gonna grow your your your

1376
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:00,369
flowers organically and then you know

1377
00:53:58,929 --> 00:54:03,669
process it with with you know

1378
00:54:00,369 --> 00:54:07,800
hydrocarbons you know other solvents so

1379
00:54:03,670 --> 00:54:11,858
it's a it's a solvent free you know

1380
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:14,530
constant concentrate processing and then

1381
00:54:11,858 --> 00:54:16,690
we put them all together into the canner

1382
00:54:14,530 --> 00:54:17,980
gars and so this is actually one of the

1383
00:54:16,690 --> 00:54:22,059
smaller ones we call this the cannery

1384
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:25,838
low but it is a ABC of cannabis cigar

1385
00:54:22,059 --> 00:54:28,750
and it's it's our flower then it's

1386
00:54:25,838 --> 00:54:30,699
wrapped in a layer of the concentrate

1387
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:32,619
and then we take the fan leaves from the

1388
00:54:30,699 --> 00:54:35,529
plant so instead of a tobacco wrap it's

1389
00:54:32,619 --> 00:54:37,869
you know each leaf is meticulously you

1390
00:54:35,530 --> 00:54:39,550
know placed around that and cured and

1391
00:54:37,869 --> 00:54:42,160
dried the whole process takes months and

1392
00:54:39,550 --> 00:54:44,440
you end up with this you know kind of

1393
00:54:42,159 --> 00:54:47,230
work of art yeah they're beautiful yeah

1394
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:49,150
yeah I'll uh I'll post some photos and

1395
00:54:47,230 --> 00:54:51,880
stuff for listeners on the podcast page

1396
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:53,588
but then also I'll show some of the

1397
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:55,390
videos that you've you shared with me

1398
00:54:53,588 --> 00:54:56,259
because one of the things that I just

1399
00:54:55,389 --> 00:54:57,519
want to mention while we're talking

1400
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:59,410
about marketing branding that's so

1401
00:54:57,519 --> 00:55:02,739
important is marketing branding is not

1402
00:54:59,409 --> 00:55:06,009
just a t-shirt or a hat or a coffee bag

1403
00:55:02,739 --> 00:55:08,289
it's sort of a collection of all these

1404
00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:10,960
things to create an identity and a

1405
00:55:08,289 --> 00:55:13,750
culture around what you're doing it's so

1406
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:16,179
important I think that people have an ID

1407
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:18,880
of not just where these products come

1408
00:55:16,179 --> 00:55:20,799
from but how they're grown and you

1409
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:22,390
really have to marketing and branding is

1410
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:24,340
is a holistic thing and that's one thing

1411
00:55:22,389 --> 00:55:25,869
I'm learning you know it's not as easy

1412
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:28,150
as just running out and buying a hundred

1413
00:55:25,869 --> 00:55:29,829
t-shirts yeah you have to create that

1414
00:55:28,150 --> 00:55:31,119
social media presence you have to create

1415
00:55:29,829 --> 00:55:33,250
that understanding of what you're doing

1416
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:35,980
and that recognition so that so when

1417
00:55:33,250 --> 00:55:38,650
someone sees that t-shirt or that coffee

1418
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:41,769
or that hat they can say hey that

1419
00:55:38,650 --> 00:55:43,690
signifies this you know quality

1420
00:55:41,769 --> 00:55:46,420
community you know Aloha

1421
00:55:43,690 --> 00:55:47,230
whatever whatever you're going for with

1422
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:49,599
your product and I think that's

1423
00:55:47,230 --> 00:55:50,800
important yeah and that's something that

1424
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:54,309
I know that origins has worked really

1425
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:56,019
hard on too and so I will I will do a

1426
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:57,489
video tour in there that we'll have on

1427
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:59,500
YouTube as well that we can share with

1428
00:55:57,489 --> 00:56:01,929
people so they can see how some of the

1429
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:03,400
more innovative reck shops are doing

1430
00:56:01,929 --> 00:56:04,269
things here in Washington yeah

1431
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:08,019
absolutely

1432
00:56:04,269 --> 00:56:10,840
you know it's I think all I can say

1433
00:56:08,019 --> 00:56:13,329
about its authenticity right if you you

1434
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:14,559
know have a strong sense of purpose in

1435
00:56:13,329 --> 00:56:17,829
what you're you know why you're doing

1436
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:20,440
what you're doing you kind of build your

1437
00:56:17,829 --> 00:56:23,079
marketing around that it'll you know

1438
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:25,809
it'll it'll work out well for you I

1439
00:56:23,079 --> 00:56:28,239
think if you're trying to put out a

1440
00:56:25,809 --> 00:56:29,799
message that doesn't truly represent who

1441
00:56:28,239 --> 00:56:32,919
you are then it's it's just gonna kind

1442
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:34,180
of fall apart yeah and but yeah you know

1443
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:36,610
you got it you got to approach it from

1444
00:56:34,179 --> 00:56:38,169
so many different angles and and you

1445
00:56:36,610 --> 00:56:39,730
know it's exciting times because there's

1446
00:56:38,170 --> 00:56:41,980
so many platforms now to get your

1447
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:44,679
message out you don't have to throw a

1448
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:46,240
ton of money at it like the hard dollars

1449
00:56:44,679 --> 00:56:48,549
like you did before you know taking out

1450
00:56:46,239 --> 00:56:50,349
magazine ads and billboards and and all

1451
00:56:48,550 --> 00:56:53,980
of these these cost you can be very

1452
00:56:50,349 --> 00:56:56,519
creative and you can use people to to

1453
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:58,420
spread the message I think that

1454
00:56:56,519 --> 00:57:01,300
nothing's better than you know like a

1455
00:56:58,420 --> 00:57:02,860
first hand recommendation you know and

1456
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:04,330
so those are those are things that you

1457
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:06,309
then you try to cultivate as much as

1458
00:57:04,329 --> 00:57:07,750
possible yeah that's a really good point

1459
00:57:06,309 --> 00:57:09,699
about being authentic because we

1460
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:11,559
nowadays were just bombarded with

1461
00:57:09,699 --> 00:57:14,109
messages all the time and marketing and

1462
00:57:11,559 --> 00:57:16,690
I think people even at a subconscious

1463
00:57:14,110 --> 00:57:19,180
level at the very least can tell when a

1464
00:57:16,690 --> 00:57:21,579
message is is fake or not authentic so

1465
00:57:19,179 --> 00:57:23,469
that's a really good point

1466
00:57:21,579 --> 00:57:25,029
was there anything else that you wanted

1467
00:57:23,469 --> 00:57:27,549
to touch on today I really appreciate

1468
00:57:25,030 --> 00:57:29,410

appreciate your your help with us sort

1472
00:57:33,608 --> 00:57:40,449
of coming into our own as organic

1473
00:57:36,099 --> 00:57:42,910
growers and you know we're you know I

1474
00:57:40,449 --> 00:57:46,118
think I definitely know we wouldn't be

1475
00:57:42,909 --> 00:57:48,730
who we are and how we are if it wasn't

1476
00:57:46,119 --> 00:57:51,250
first out of our you know opportunity to

1477
00:57:48,730 --> 00:57:52,480
run into you at that transition time so

1478
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:53,949
so that's been great

1479
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:55,240
no it's been good and I think it's

1480
00:57:53,949 --> 00:57:58,000
important to collaborate with people in

1481
00:57:55,239 --> 00:57:59,439
the industry and I know you and I are

1482
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,969
always learning new things and when I

1483
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:02,500
learned something new related to soil I

1484
00:58:00,969 --> 00:58:03,819
think matter it would matter for you I'm

1485
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:05,199
calling you up and when you discover

1486
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:08,050
something you know you're sharing with

1487
00:58:05,199 --> 00:58:10,598
me and I think that's how we all stay

1488
00:58:08,050 --> 00:58:12,550
competitive you know with absolutely you

1489
00:58:10,599 --> 00:58:13,930
know and I think I you know I can't

1490
00:58:12,550 --> 00:58:16,780
stress that enough I think there is um

1491
00:58:13,929 --> 00:58:19,299
you know there's there's there needs to

1492
00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:20,530
be more unity you know the cannabis

1493
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:22,750

1494
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:23,740
competitive you know the the gloves come

1495
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:24,730
off and it kinky

00:58:23,739 --> 00:58:26,409
you know everybody's kind of fight for

1497
00:58:24,730 --> 00:58:27,969
their own but I don't think it has to be

1498
00:58:26,409 --> 00:58:32,139
like that you know you look at other

1499
00:58:27,969 --> 00:58:35,829
industries and like-minded brands and

1500
