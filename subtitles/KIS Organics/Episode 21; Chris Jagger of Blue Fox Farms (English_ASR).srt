farmer both his farm and his

26
00:01:03,058 --> 00:01:07,228
agricultural services used living soils

27
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,200
as a foundation to scale farming

28
00:01:07,228 --> 00:01:11,609
operations efficiently and affordably he

29
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,560

living soil symposium each March the

32
00:01:16,228 --> 00:01:20,099
symposium is an interactive conference

33
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,989
for farmers interested in regenerative

34
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:23,899
farming techniques to exchange knowledge

35
00:01:21,989 --> 00:01:26,368
and gain insight in a peer-to-peer

36
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:27,509
environment all right thanks Chris I

37
00:01:26,368 --> 00:01:29,790
really appreciate you coming on the show

38
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:31,259
today thanks dad yeah I wanted to start

39
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,780
off giving listeners a little bit of

40
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:36,478
your background sure yeah

41
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:40,228
my wife and I have Blue Fox farm in

42
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:43,170
Southern Oregon and we grow a variety of

43
00:01:40,228 --> 00:01:44,879
mixed vegetables on about 40 acres we

44
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,829
have about 15 acres in production the

45
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:50,670
last couple years and we've been down

46
00:01:46,828 --> 00:01:52,769
here for about 16 years now and we've

47
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:55,969
got two kids that were raising as well

48
00:01:52,769 --> 00:01:58,679
two boys we really we focus a lot on

49
00:01:55,968 --> 00:02:00,899
direct sales to the customers that we

50
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,689
have through farmers markets directed

51
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:06,239
co-ops and that kind of stuff and then

52
00:02:03,688 --> 00:02:08,699
also I've the founder of the living soil

53
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:10,269
symposium that were in our third year

54
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:12,939
this year

55
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:14,590
and that besides a couple other side

56
00:02:12,939 --> 00:02:16,840
projects that I have kind of take up

57
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:19,120
most of my time so how did you get into

58
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,979
farming before you moved to Oregon I we

59
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,509
talked a little before the podcast and

60
00:02:20,979 --> 00:02:25,389
you had started out in California

61
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:28,359
mentioned yeah we started in Santa Cruz

62
00:02:25,389 --> 00:02:30,699
in the late 90s that was right at the

63
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,340
very beginning of when organics really

64
00:02:30,699 --> 00:02:35,649
started taking off and the local

65
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:37,750
movement was just starting to you know

66
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:40,480
gain its footing and so we started

67
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:41,830
interning on farms there and just

68
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:43,929
working in the fields picking

69
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:47,680
strawberries picking beans you know just

70
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:50,560
that that grind doing the work and then

71
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:53,469
we ended up moving to Colorado and

72
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:56,229
interning there on a couple farms and

73
00:02:53,469 --> 00:02:58,000
then my wife and I ended up managing one

74
00:02:56,229 --> 00:03:00,280
of the farms that she hadn't turned on

75
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,830
for a couple years and that really gave

76
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:05,379
us our chops as far as how to how to be

77
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:07,420
managers not just farmers so then you

78
00:03:05,379 --> 00:03:09,579
moved out to Oregon and I know you

79
00:03:07,419 --> 00:03:11,139
bought some land there and expanded and

80
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:13,210
have kind of gone through some growing

81
00:03:11,139 --> 00:03:15,909
pains can you talk a little bit about

82
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:19,030
your background with cannabis sure yeah

83
00:03:15,909 --> 00:03:21,639
my background with cannabis it's it's

84
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:24,759
been a very loose relationship over the

85
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:27,039
years I haven't actively been a grower

86
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:28,750
but I've been surrounded by a really

87
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:32,349
strong community here in Southern Oregon

88
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:33,789
of cannabis growers and I've always been

89
00:03:32,349 --> 00:03:36,400
supportive of what they're doing and

90
00:03:33,789 --> 00:03:38,799
we've all interacted with each other

91
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,140
over the years and kind of shared tips

92
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:43,990
because it's all agriculture so we've

93
00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:46,208
all wanted to figure out what we can do

94
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:49,540
to help each other that's that's really

95
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:51,849
my my relationship has been as a support

96
00:03:49,539 --> 00:03:53,889
to that industry as it's grown and

97
00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:55,329
changed yeah and you brought up

98
00:03:53,889 --> 00:03:58,229
something that I know we're both big

99
00:03:55,330 --> 00:04:01,450
proponents of which is that cannabis and

100
00:03:58,229 --> 00:04:03,310
agriculture are should be one in the

101
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:05,919
same in a lot of ways that we can pull a

102
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:08,289
lot of great information and Technology

103
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:10,359
and stuff from the farming community and

104
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:11,650
from agriculture that already exists we

105
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:14,260
don't need to reinvent the wheel here

106
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:16,180
and Brae yes you know cannabis is a

107
00:04:14,259 --> 00:04:18,250
special plant in a lot of ways in terms

108
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:20,530
of its medicinal values but that doesn't

109
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:24,509
mean that we can't cultivate it in some

110
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:27,279
in a similar fashion I know that

111
00:04:24,509 --> 00:04:29,079
you mentioned to me off air that you've

112
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:31,269
started you had your first year growing

113
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:32,919
hemp which is in a lot of ways similar

114
00:04:31,269 --> 00:04:35,949
to cannabis can you talk a little bit

115
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:37,990
about that experience yeah for sure that

116
00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:40,360
was really exciting to take that project

117
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:44,530
on I looked at it as really a proof of

118
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:47,680
concept my approach for it was to try to

119
00:04:44,529 --> 00:04:51,219
grow the hemp crop exactly how I would a

120
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:53,199
vegetable crop so I been working on

121
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:55,420
building my soil fertility in my soil

122
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:58,449
biology up over the last several years

123
00:04:55,420 --> 00:05:00,370
working this ground and I I had a

124
00:04:58,449 --> 00:05:02,349
special spot that I knew I wanted to put

125
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:04,899
the crop in just it's the area that I've

126
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:06,370
done the most work on and I I said well

127
00:05:04,899 --> 00:05:08,139
I want to be able to grow this just like

128
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:10,449
I grow a kale crop and I want to see if

129
00:05:08,139 --> 00:05:12,849
I can have success from that and I also

130
00:05:10,449 --> 00:05:15,909
wanted to grow it without having to put

131
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:18,040
a lot of hand labor into the plot I

132
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:21,250
wanted to be able to just grow it on

133
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:24,189
scale just as a way to look at how we

134
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:26,769
might scale up production so we did all

135
00:05:24,189 --> 00:05:29,319
of the work with as far as bed prep goes

136
00:05:26,769 --> 00:05:31,120
with our tractors the same the same

137
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:33,329
bedding system that we use in a kale

138
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,370
crop we use the same fertility program

139
00:05:33,329 --> 00:05:38,560
that we use with our kale crops we

140
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:42,579
transplanted it mechanically with a

141
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:45,040
waterwheel transplanter and we set it up

142
00:05:42,579 --> 00:05:48,579
in a way with a bed system where we were

143
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:50,800
able to cultivate with our tractors

144
00:05:48,579 --> 00:05:52,930
throughout the entire lifecycle so we

145
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,090
had an empty alleyway between the rows

146
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:58,050
where then we could cultivate on either

147
00:05:55,089 --> 00:06:01,289
side once it got taller and bigger and

148
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:04,750
we started with an overhead irrigation

149
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:06,610
system and we irrigated overhead all the

150
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:09,430
way up until the second week of flower

151
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:11,800
and then we transferred to a drip tape

152
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:14,379
after that and so it was just really

153
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:17,590
interesting to watch the season progress

154
00:06:14,379 --> 00:06:20,769
and see how amazing these plants are

155
00:06:17,589 --> 00:06:23,769
growing and how how effective they are

156
00:06:20,769 --> 00:06:26,379
at at just pulling off like this amazing

157
00:06:23,769 --> 00:06:28,750
growth in such a short period of time

158
00:06:26,379 --> 00:06:33,009
and at the end of the season the biggest

159
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:34,990
cost to us was the labour of harvesting

160
00:06:33,009 --> 00:06:37,060
you know that was our biggest bottleneck

161
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:37,990
was then you know getting the plants

162
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:41,620
down and

163
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:44,139
into our barn to start the drying

164
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:47,079
process and that that really was the

165
00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:49,180
only area that took a large amount of

166
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:50,709
hand labor everything else was done in a

167
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:53,139
way that we would do any other vegetable

168
00:06:50,709 --> 00:06:54,939
crop it was it was really amazing to to

169
00:06:53,139 --> 00:06:56,680
watch it grow did you face any

170
00:06:54,939 --> 00:06:58,810
particular challenges with it and

171
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,038
related to like say pests and disease

172
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:04,660
that you didn't face with your other

173
00:07:00,038 --> 00:07:06,490
crops uh no not really and I I think

174
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:09,069
there's a lot of ways we could look at

175
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:11,199
that it was a very dry fall here in

176
00:07:09,069 --> 00:07:14,699
Southern Oregon we had a really long

177
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:18,400
summer and so that was an advantage we

178
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:20,919
have strong winds that blow through our

179
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:23,288
valley every afternoon so as far as any

180
00:07:20,918 --> 00:07:25,899
disease pressures that we might see in

181
00:07:23,288 --> 00:07:28,209
vegetable crops we didn't see any any

182
00:07:25,899 --> 00:07:29,888
problems there at all and we had the

183
00:07:28,209 --> 00:07:31,329
plants spaced out enough that they

184
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:34,478
weren't compacted in so they were

185
00:07:31,329 --> 00:07:37,658
planted on six foot centers out in the

186
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:40,120
in the beds the pest pressure the only

187
00:07:37,658 --> 00:07:42,250
pest pressure we really saw was right

188
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:44,288
after transplant was cucumber beetles

189
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:47,348
we've got cucumber beetles here that are

190
00:07:44,288 --> 00:07:49,598
just rampant they're just it's amazing

191
00:07:47,348 --> 00:07:51,430
how strong of a population they have and

192
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:53,500
so the way we dealt with that was we

193
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:55,629
covered the plants right after

194
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:57,639
transplant with insect netting that we

195
00:07:55,629 --> 00:07:59,949
use on like a lot of our Brassica crops

196
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:01,629
to keep flea beetles off of and that

197
00:07:59,949 --> 00:08:04,389
worked great like once we got the plants

198
00:08:01,629 --> 00:08:05,649
up to a healthy healthy size and then

199
00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:07,658
they were just starting to crank they

200
00:08:05,649 --> 00:08:09,848
could grow out of any pest pressure

201
00:08:07,658 --> 00:08:11,949
after that and we did we constantly

202
00:08:09,848 --> 00:08:15,399
monitored throughout the season or any

203
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:17,830
kind of mite pressure of any sort or any

204
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:20,439
other disease pressure we were

205
00:08:17,829 --> 00:08:22,300
constantly checking the fields just to

206
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:24,399
just to observe and see what we saw but

207
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,960
other than that it was it was a pretty

208
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:27,788
straightforward season so you didn't

209
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:29,620
spray anything on the crop other than it

210
00:08:27,788 --> 00:08:31,389
sounds like overhead watering yeah

211
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:33,639
overhead watering we did a little bit of

212
00:08:31,389 --> 00:08:35,709
supplemental foliar with fish

213
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:38,049
hydrolysate but other than that yeah it

214
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:40,538
was just a let it rip wow that's great

215
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:44,039
and did you notice anything else in

216
00:08:40,538 --> 00:08:46,179
terms of the crop itself any any changes

217
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:49,389
different than say when you've seen

218
00:08:46,179 --> 00:08:50,679
cannabis I was ham very similar in all

219
00:08:49,389 --> 00:08:51,730
respects or were there anything that you

220
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:53,919
notice that was project

221
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:55,329
different you know honestly everybody

222
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:56,948
that walked through the field throughout

223
00:08:55,328 --> 00:08:59,638
the season didn't believe that it was a

224
00:08:56,948 --> 00:09:01,659
hemp crop it just has such a similar

225
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:03,399
structure to cannabis

226
00:09:01,659 --> 00:09:05,620
they were definitely couldn't believe

227
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:07,120
that that was hemp and I I think that

228
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:10,179
that you can attribute that to the fact

229
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:12,448
that the high CBD hemp crops that are

230
00:09:10,179 --> 00:09:14,948
specific for that they've come out of a

231
00:09:12,448 --> 00:09:17,559
breeding regime I am assuming from the

232
00:09:14,948 --> 00:09:19,000
cannabis lineage you know it's a little

233
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:21,609
bit different than what I think of as

234
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,379
far as like a fiber hemp would be but

235
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:24,759
yeah other than that no it was it was

236
00:09:23,379 --> 00:09:27,458
really straightforward the structure is

237
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:30,220
beautiful we had on average I'd say the

238
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:32,828
plants varied between 6 and 10 feet tall

239
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:35,199
at the end I liked the more compact

240
00:09:32,828 --> 00:09:38,289
smaller plants they definitely were more

241
00:09:35,198 --> 00:09:40,328
manageable and the the density of the

242
00:09:38,289 --> 00:09:42,849
flowers were were better on those

243
00:09:40,328 --> 00:09:44,708
smaller compact plants what cultivars

244
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:46,290
did you run and did you do any testing

245
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:49,239
afterwards how did the plants finish

246
00:09:46,289 --> 00:09:52,028
yeah they were they were all cultivars

247
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:55,000
from the boring hemp company in boring

248
00:09:52,028 --> 00:09:58,689
Oregon and they were all Auto - that's

249
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:02,318
the OTT OH - crossed with a variety of

250
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:04,930
other genetics and we did do some

251
00:10:02,318 --> 00:10:07,299
independent testing after after the fact

252
00:10:04,929 --> 00:10:10,149
and you know I I didn't I didn't really

253
00:10:07,299 --> 00:10:12,370
have much to compare it to so for me

254
00:10:10,149 --> 00:10:14,559
it's going to be going forward like what

255
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:17,198
I what I can see as far as improvements

256
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:19,750
from season to season you know I'm I'm

257
00:10:17,198 --> 00:10:21,519
no expert on the crop itself I was just

258
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:23,470
growing it out more than anything - just

259
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,149
as a starting place to see what I could

260
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:28,600
learn so what are your future plans

261
00:10:25,149 --> 00:10:30,639
around him really depends on what the

262
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:33,310
marketplace is like I think that we're

263
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:36,909
quickly seeing it moved into being a

264
00:10:33,309 --> 00:10:39,369
commodity crop and so it comes down to a

265
00:10:36,909 --> 00:10:40,750
matter of scaling properly and whether

266
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:43,470
we want to do that or not

267
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:46,000
so I've had a lot of other farmers

268
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:47,379
vegetable farmers especially you know

269
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,750
called me up and say hey should I grow

270
00:10:47,379 --> 00:10:51,068
of em crop and my answer to them always

271
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,839
is like as long as you have a

272
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:54,519
marketplace for it because we've seen

273
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:57,610
the market place's is definitely

274
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:59,620
challenging and flooded already so I'm

275
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:01,870
encouraged by the future of it all I

276
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:04,568
think I'm just going to wait and see how

277
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:05,649
it all develops once kind of the the

278
00:11:04,568 --> 00:11:07,299
madness of it all

279
00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:09,220
of this first couple seasons kind of

280
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:11,579
dies down do you think there's going to

281
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:15,190
be more of a market for these high CBD

282
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:16,629
plants that are grown organically as

283
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:18,850
people will start using them more for

284
00:11:16,629 --> 00:11:20,379
medicine do you see this side of the

285
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:23,470
industry growing just from your own

286
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:25,870
experience yeah I think so I think it's

287
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:29,670
a matter of the two schools of thought

288
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:32,289
of whether full spectrum full spectrum

289
00:11:29,669 --> 00:11:35,229
material as opposed to an isolated

290
00:11:32,289 --> 00:11:37,240
material which is more beneficial right

291
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:39,820
now a lot of times that isolated

292
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:42,009
material is more easily

293
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:43,810
I think distributed nationwide that's my

294
00:11:42,009 --> 00:11:46,330
understanding at least and the full

295
00:11:43,809 --> 00:11:48,879
spectrum material is something that it I

296
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:51,550
think stays more in state right now I

297
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:53,649
think I think the industry is very young

298
00:11:51,549 --> 00:11:55,509
right now and it's going to be

299
00:11:53,649 --> 00:11:58,809
interesting to see how it matures but I

300
00:11:55,509 --> 00:12:00,759
would hope from what I hear from people

301
00:11:58,809 --> 00:12:02,709
that are more knowledgeable in that

302
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:04,450
arena than me from what I can hear is

303
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:06,730
that there's a lot more public

304
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:09,278
acceptance each year and people are

305
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:12,610
finding real intrinsic value in using

306
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:14,080
using those high CBD materials you know

307
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:16,690
to their advantage for their health and

308
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:18,430
I think that as science gets behind it

309
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:20,800
more and can prove more so it's just not

310
00:12:18,429 --> 00:12:23,708
anecdotal understanding that we'll see

311
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:25,599
wider and wider acceptance yeah my

312
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:28,829
father is actually dealing with a rare

313
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:33,759
disease called syidp that's the chronic

314
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:35,730
neuropathy and he uses cannabis that he

315
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:38,409
infuses with coconut oil as a way of

316
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:40,629
topical to help treat a lot of his pain

317
00:12:38,409 --> 00:12:42,730
and it's been life-changing to help him

318
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:45,850
because before that they had him on

319
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:48,070
super high levels of narcotics that was

320
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:50,230
really really tough it was changing his

321
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:52,060
personality it took away all his energy

322
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:54,850
it actually didn't help deal with the

323
00:12:52,059 --> 00:12:56,679
pain over time so I'm I'm really helpful

324
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:58,089
in the medicinal side of this so I'm

325
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:59,409
glad to hear that there's farmers like

326
00:12:58,089 --> 00:13:02,620
you out there growing happen and

327
00:12:59,409 --> 00:13:05,350
exploring the CBD aspects of cannabis so

328
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:07,509
thank you yeah and I did want to change

329
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:10,360
topic a little bit since we were talking

330
00:13:07,509 --> 00:13:12,580
about the demand I know this is a little

331
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:15,669
bit topical right now I've read more

332
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:19,389
articles about the massive amount of

333
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:19,569
excess cannabis in Oregon and I since

334
00:13:19,389 --> 00:13:21,250
you

335
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:23,110
surrounded by these farmers what are

336
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:25,389
what are you hearing regarding this

337
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:28,149
topic are people worried about next

338
00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:30,100
season or are they yeah I guess where

339
00:13:28,149 --> 00:13:32,709
are you at with that yeah I mean it's

340
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:35,139
yeah the Southern Oregon is a hotbed for

341
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:37,810
for the industry the rec industry right

342
00:13:35,139 --> 00:13:40,629
now and the others massive concern among

343
00:13:37,809 --> 00:13:45,309
a lot of folks because it I think it

344
00:13:40,629 --> 00:13:47,889
changed faster and scaled larger and

345
00:13:45,309 --> 00:13:51,279
quicker than anybody could assume that

346
00:13:47,889 --> 00:13:53,500
it would and there's been no real cap on

347
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:56,889
the number of licenses as far as I

348
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:58,809
understand and so it's just been race to

349
00:13:56,889 --> 00:14:01,000
the bottom almost for most people and

350
00:13:58,809 --> 00:14:03,759
that's really disconcerting for people

351
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,519
that have put their entire savings into

352
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:09,009
building these brands and now they don't

353
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:11,079
have anywhere for it to go just because

354
00:14:09,009 --> 00:14:13,149
there's just not the there's not the

355
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:16,090
population base here in Oregon to

356
00:14:13,149 --> 00:14:18,159
support that so yeah it's it's pretty

357
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:20,920
scary you know and it affects all of us

358
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:22,719
down here not just the people directly

359
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:24,909
involved in the cannabis industry but

360
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,190
all the support industries and even just

361
00:14:24,909 --> 00:14:28,600
the local economy here is there's a lot

362
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:30,940
of people that are being very cautious

363
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:33,370
with if they expand any of their

364
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:34,900
businesses or how they're going forward

365
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:37,269
people are being very cautious because I

366
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:40,000
think we can see the bottom drop out

367
00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:42,189
pretty quickly now does that mean that

368
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,350
it won't recover no I don't think so I

369
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:46,720
think that it's just part of the growing

370
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:49,779
pains of the industry I just don't think

371
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,910
that people expected to see it shift so

372
00:14:49,779 --> 00:14:53,529
rapidly yeah and I think the way that

373
00:14:51,909 --> 00:14:55,509
people are going to survive is by

374
00:14:53,529 --> 00:14:57,370
becoming more efficient in the way

375
00:14:55,509 --> 00:15:00,490
they're growing and reducing their

376
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:01,570
expenses and you love you know a lot of

377
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:04,389
the things that we talk about on this

378
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:06,640
podcast in terms of using using

379
00:15:04,389 --> 00:15:10,629
methodologies and ideas out of the the

380
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:12,519
farming or AG community so we'll see or

381
00:15:10,629 --> 00:15:14,950
differentiating your product by being

382
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:17,169
yep you know organic or craft or having

383
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:19,810
some something that makes you unique

384
00:15:17,169 --> 00:15:21,849
from someone that someone's flowers you

385
00:15:19,809 --> 00:15:24,250
know just down the road yep I think

386
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:26,860
differentiation is going to be that's

387
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:28,120
the that's the hot item that people are

388
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:30,190
trying to figure out right now is

389
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:31,659
differentiating is the thing that needs

390
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:32,980
to happen it's just a question of how

391
00:15:31,659 --> 00:15:34,509
you know yeah

392
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:36,279
stuff because you have guys that are

393
00:15:34,509 --> 00:15:38,049
farmers you know they're not they're not

394
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:40,240
marketing companies and they don't know

395
00:15:38,049 --> 00:15:41,500
how to build a brand necessarily they

396
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,840
may be growing great high quality

397
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:45,340
cannabis that's organic but in terms of

398
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:47,379
getting that information out to the

399
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:49,090
consumer that's a whole different skill

400
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:51,490
set and it's a big challenge I think for

401
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:53,560
a lot of people and so I'm hopeful that

402
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:55,659
some of this will come out as the

403
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:59,259
industry evolves but that's that's a big

404
00:15:55,659 --> 00:16:00,789
concern for me yep I agree so one of the

405
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:02,649
things that I was really excited to talk

406
00:16:00,789 --> 00:16:05,079
about with you when I found out that you

407
00:16:02,649 --> 00:16:06,730
were coming on the podcast was because

408
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:09,129
you've been farming vegetables for so

409
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:10,899
long and you have this this level of

410
00:16:09,129 --> 00:16:12,279
experience I wanted to talk a little bit

411
00:16:10,899 --> 00:16:14,439
about some of the mistakes that you've

412
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:16,569
made over the years because I know for

413
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:18,010
me a lot of the biggest lessons I've

414
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:20,410
learned and the biggest improvements

415
00:16:18,009 --> 00:16:22,029
I've made have been from screw ups you

416
00:16:20,409 --> 00:16:24,459
know the gas get a lot of money so I

417
00:16:22,029 --> 00:16:25,449
love to hear some from your perspective

418
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:26,950
what are some of the mistakes that

419
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:29,140
you've made that you that have really

420
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:30,759
improved your farming yeah there's been

421
00:16:29,139 --> 00:16:32,889
a lot and you know that's what I always

422
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:35,080
tell people is that if if you're a

423
00:16:32,889 --> 00:16:37,480
farmer just getting into farming and you

424
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:39,639
go to an elder farmer and ask hey what

425
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:42,039
what can I do to be successful

426
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:43,840
generally the farmers that are being the

427
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:45,579
most honest will not tell you what you

428
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:48,129
can do they'll tell you what not to do

429
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:50,530
and so that's that's definitely what I

430
00:16:48,129 --> 00:16:53,289
talk with younger farmers about a lot

431
00:16:50,529 --> 00:16:56,319
for me the things that if I could do it

432
00:16:53,289 --> 00:16:58,870
all over again I think I would have I

433
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:02,290
would have invested in the proper

434
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:05,259
machinery and tools to scale up more

435
00:17:02,289 --> 00:17:09,789
effectively earlier and I think that I

436
00:17:05,259 --> 00:17:13,059
would have focused even more on training

437
00:17:09,789 --> 00:17:16,959
my people and having a really good

438
00:17:13,059 --> 00:17:20,109
business culture or like on farm culture

439
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:22,509
like focusing even more on taking care

440
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:24,578
of my taking care of my crew from the

441
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:26,940
beginning and not that I never not that

442
00:17:24,578 --> 00:17:31,029
I didn't take care of my crew but just

443
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:33,519
focusing on the culture surrounding what

444
00:17:31,029 --> 00:17:36,579
the work days and really looking at how

445
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:38,379
you can encourage people to keep going

446
00:17:36,579 --> 00:17:40,480
because you know farming is not easy

447
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:43,720
work and so you get in the middle of the

448
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:46,610
100 degree day in August and you see a

449
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:48,950
lot of people's productivity really dip

450
00:17:46,609 --> 00:17:50,779
and so I've learned over the years tips

451
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:54,048
and tricks that I can pass on to my

452
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:57,798
field managers to kind of keep the work

453
00:17:54,048 --> 00:17:59,869
ethic and the and the whole vibe of the

454
00:17:57,798 --> 00:18:02,960
crew up you know those are the biggest

455
00:17:59,869 --> 00:18:05,558
things is because the people really are

456
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:09,288
the glue that keeps it all together and

457
00:18:05,558 --> 00:18:13,460
another thing that I've learned is once

458
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:16,400
I was able to afford a full-time tractor

459
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:19,610
slash irrigation slash maintenance guy

460
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:21,470
onto my crew that was a life changer for

461
00:18:19,609 --> 00:18:24,439
me too because then I could focus on

462
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:25,788
being the farmer and he focused on the

463
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,919
nuts and bolts of keeping it all

464
00:18:25,788 --> 00:18:29,720
together but but some of those things

465
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:32,990
you know that that comes with time as

466
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:34,759
you scale and as you grow so those are

467
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:37,099
the biggest things that I've I've

468
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:39,829
learned you know there's also micro

469
00:18:37,099 --> 00:18:41,839
fails that I've had as far you know just

470
00:18:39,829 --> 00:18:43,908
a little things of like getting the

471
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:45,048
proper water on transplants as soon as

472
00:18:43,909 --> 00:18:47,780
you put them out there and not waiting

473
00:18:45,048 --> 00:18:49,548
and just having little failures here and

474
00:18:47,779 --> 00:18:51,619
there but that that kind of just comes

475
00:18:49,548 --> 00:18:54,440
with the territory on a day to day basis

476
00:18:51,619 --> 00:18:55,609
yeah I think going back to what you

477
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,740
mentioned about your staff I think

478
00:18:55,609 --> 00:19:00,139
that's really important and one thing

479
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:03,259
that I learned pretty quickly is that I

480
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:04,788
can't expect an employee to have to work

481
00:19:03,259 --> 00:19:07,009
as hard as I'm willing to work that's

482
00:19:04,788 --> 00:19:08,658
not their business yeah you know they

483
00:19:07,009 --> 00:19:09,950
may have a passion for farming but the

484
00:19:08,659 --> 00:19:11,299
other day like you mentioned you're in

485
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:14,269
hundred degree weather and it's it's

486
00:19:11,298 --> 00:19:16,788
brutal and it's it's a different

487
00:19:14,269 --> 00:19:19,849
mentality so building that culture and

488
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:21,500
finding ways to incentivize and support

489
00:19:19,849 --> 00:19:23,058
your staff is so important and then

490
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,919
getting the right staff in place I've

491
00:19:23,058 --> 00:19:27,079
had the issues where I've held on to

492
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:29,538
staff members that may be necessarily

493
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:30,889
weren't the right fit but it kept him on

494
00:19:29,538 --> 00:19:33,109
longer than I should have you know

495
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:35,240
because we do believe in the people it's

496
00:19:33,109 --> 00:19:38,658
like it's like family at a certain point

497
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:41,359
yeah well and and one of the things that

498
00:19:38,659 --> 00:19:43,640
like a big mental shift for me was

499
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:45,408
several years ago I had an older friend

500
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,509
that had been farming for a long time

501
00:19:45,409 --> 00:19:50,990
and he said to me he said the sooner you

502
00:19:47,509 --> 00:19:53,298
can realize that you work for your

503
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:55,819
employees and not the other way around

504
00:19:53,298 --> 00:19:57,889
the better your your farm culture is

505
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:59,148
going to be and I took me a while to

506
00:19:57,890 --> 00:19:59,960
understand that but then I started

507
00:19:59,148 --> 00:20:02,149
realizing like

508
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:04,039
that's my job is to make sure that my

509
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:05,870
employees have everything they need and

510
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:07,670
so if there is failure on their part

511
00:20:05,869 --> 00:20:10,189
it's because I haven't trained them well

512
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:12,380
enough and so once I started approaching

513
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:14,210
it like that man things got so much

514
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:16,040
easier because any time a problem would

515
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:18,289
come up I'd be like okay what am I not

516
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:20,599
doing here effectively to teach them and

517
00:20:18,289 --> 00:20:22,430
that doesn't fix the problems of you

518
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:23,869
know somebody that just doesn't care and

519
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:25,730
just doesn't come to work because they

520
00:20:23,869 --> 00:20:28,429
have a horrible work ethic but on the

521
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:30,559
day-to-day I found that when I started

522
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:32,779
focusing on what I could do to make it a

523
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:35,599
great work environment for them things

524
00:20:32,779 --> 00:20:36,649
got a lot easier that's great and you

525
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:38,000
get a lot of feedback from your

526
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:39,410
employees in terms of ways to make

527
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,559
improvements around the farm and things

528
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:45,320
like that yeah I do I I have a very open

529
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:47,509
door policy with what's going on and we

530
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:49,369
also understand each other to the point

531
00:20:47,509 --> 00:20:52,069
that if somebody comes and says hey I

532
00:20:49,369 --> 00:20:54,259
see it like this and I say well from my

533
00:20:52,069 --> 00:20:56,359
experience that just doesn't work but I

534
00:20:54,259 --> 00:20:58,009
appreciate your feedback then they know

535
00:20:56,359 --> 00:20:59,659
that I'm not just shooting them down to

536
00:20:58,009 --> 00:21:03,619
shoot them down they generally will

537
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:05,210
trust me from a point of experience you

538
00:21:03,619 --> 00:21:07,250
know and I try to be open and

539
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:09,410
communicate that clearly yeah that's

540
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:11,539
great I always encourage my staff to

541
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:13,730
speak up but then also if they do notice

542
00:21:11,539 --> 00:21:15,319
a problem to try and get me a solution

543
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,789
as well when they come to me with that

544
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:18,200
problem they don't they don't have to if

545
00:21:16,789 --> 00:21:19,970
they're not able to come up with one but

546
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,350
a lot of times I find though they'll

547
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:21,860
come to me and say hey we're having this

548
00:21:21,349 --> 00:21:24,469
problem

549
00:21:21,859 --> 00:21:25,939
say with an animal enclosure and this is

550
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:27,860
what I think we need to do to solve it

551
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:28,340
and I can just turn in them and say

552
00:21:27,859 --> 00:21:30,619
that's great

553
00:21:28,339 --> 00:21:33,349
let's do it you know because they're

554
00:21:30,619 --> 00:21:35,479
taking ownership of the land and of the

555
00:21:33,349 --> 00:21:36,949
business and making good decisions that

556
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:39,799
are helping all of us have a better

557
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:42,049
experience so again yeah I can't say

558
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:43,879
enough good things about that yep that's

559
00:21:42,049 --> 00:21:46,220
the way to do it and then in terms of

560
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,780
equipment I know I've bought equipment

561
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:50,750
that was either underpowered or not

562
00:21:47,779 --> 00:21:53,299
suited for the right job in my file my

563
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:55,880
farm I have have you made that mistake

564
00:21:53,299 --> 00:21:57,950
in your process or do you have anything

565
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:59,210
regarding purchasing equipment or using

566
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:02,569
equipment that you'd like to touch on

567
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:05,059
yeah generally all I mean this is I

568
00:22:02,569 --> 00:22:07,429
guess it sounds like a really classic

569
00:22:05,059 --> 00:22:10,399
American response or whatever which is

570
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:12,680
always buy the biggest machinery that

571
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,620
you can afford and I don't mean just go

572
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:16,500
overboard with

573
00:22:13,619 --> 00:22:18,779
but I found over the years that anytime

574
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:21,450
I've bought a I'm like well I can afford

575
00:22:18,779 --> 00:22:23,460
a six foot disc or if I if it hurts a

576
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:25,860
little bit I could buy an 8 foot disc

577
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:28,079
and just the efficiencies that come with

578
00:22:25,859 --> 00:22:30,990
the proper sizing of those things and

579
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:33,750
looking at the long term payout if

580
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:36,269
you're spending you know 20% more

581
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:39,000
initially the long term payout is going

582
00:22:36,269 --> 00:22:40,769
to give you a 50% return well then you

583
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,470
should do it you know those are the

584
00:22:40,769 --> 00:22:46,289
biggest things for me is just properly

585
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:49,200
sizing the equipment and that came from

586
00:22:46,289 --> 00:22:52,019
just asking experienced farmers you know

587
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,940
what they've used so I I can't encourage

588
00:22:52,019 --> 00:22:56,069
people enough to reach out to people

589
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:57,450
that have more experience than you yeah

590
00:22:56,069 --> 00:22:58,710
that's great and I think encouraging

591
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:00,630
people to get to know your neighbors

592
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,920
because that's where your pest pressures

593
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:03,809
are coming from they may know the

594
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:05,580
history of your land they can give you

595
00:23:03,808 --> 00:23:09,240
experience with what grows well in your

596
00:23:05,579 --> 00:23:12,808
area ton of benefits there yep I agree

597
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:14,279
100% so any other advice to new farmers

598
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:17,160
people that want to get into farming

599
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:19,349
yeah the the things that I I've been

600
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:21,540
asked that question a lot over the years

601
00:23:19,349 --> 00:23:25,649
and the things that I always tell folks

602
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:28,319
are number one is learn how to be a

603
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:30,480
business owner like farming is actually

604
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:32,939
pretty easy I mean it's tough but it's

605
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:35,579
way easier than running a business and

606
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:36,900
so if you can't find that bottom line

607
00:23:35,579 --> 00:23:39,029
then you're not going to stay in

608
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:40,890
business very long so that's the thing

609
00:23:39,029 --> 00:23:43,170
that that I've learned over the years I

610
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:46,410
think the modern farmer is way more like

611
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:48,450
an entrepreneur than the classic idyllic

612
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:50,700
vision of what a farmer was you know

613
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:52,980
when our grandparents were we're young

614
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:54,808
so that's one thing is learn how to run

615
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:57,808
a business and then the second thing

616
00:23:54,808 --> 00:24:00,240
that I always tell folks is be okay with

617
00:23:57,808 --> 00:24:02,099
leasing land you don't have to own the

618
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,230
farm at least not at first

619
00:24:02,099 --> 00:24:06,299
and if I could do it all over again I

620
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:08,700
think my wife and I probably would have

621
00:24:06,299 --> 00:24:11,879
found a small house somewhere on a small

622
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:14,279
piece of land and leased ground to get

623
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:16,800
used to growing in our area especially

624
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:18,389
where we moved into this area and then

625
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:20,519
you're just not tied to that piece of

626
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:23,370
land because like our home property that

627
00:24:20,519 --> 00:24:24,929
we originally bought it's good land but

628
00:24:23,369 --> 00:24:27,239
it's nothing like the ground that we

629
00:24:24,929 --> 00:24:29,309
have our production acreage on now

630
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:31,529
and so that that's something that I

631
00:24:29,308 --> 00:24:34,139
think that people get caught up in the

632
00:24:31,529 --> 00:24:37,079
idyllic vision of like oh I have to own

633
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:39,270
my own farm to be be able to be a farmer

634
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:41,990
and that just isn't true because the the

635
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:43,950
amount of land available out there is is

636
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:46,500
unbelievable and it's growing every year

637
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:48,179
you just have to figure out smart

638
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:50,009
contractual agreements with the land

639
00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:52,620
owners to to make sure you protect

640
00:24:50,009 --> 00:24:55,920
yourself and it can take years to bring

641
00:24:52,619 --> 00:24:57,389
back poor soils and so it's you bring up

642
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:59,580
a good point in something that actually

643
00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:01,679
Steve Solomon talked about when he first

644
00:24:59,579 --> 00:25:03,419
started homesteading in Oregon is he

645
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:04,769
wishes that he had bought better land

646
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:06,960
because it took him forever to bring

647
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:08,789
that land back yes didn't look at it

648
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,400
closely enough Lee was first purchasing

649
00:25:08,789 --> 00:25:12,779
yep yep that's that's where we're at I

650
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:15,330
mean once we started growing on our

651
00:25:12,779 --> 00:25:18,058
production piece that we have the soil

652
00:25:15,329 --> 00:25:22,649
was at least a hundred times better than

653
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:25,319
the property at home and so we just saw

654
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:28,080
our yields go through the roof with not

655
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:30,240
any extra work of what we had been doing

656
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:33,178
before so that was just a really eye

657
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,799
opening for us yes so in terms of

658
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:36,540
growing on your lands

659
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:38,519
you're obviously planting directly in

660
00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:42,269
the ground I do see a lot of cannabis

661
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:43,859
farmers planting into containers yeah do

662
00:25:42,269 --> 00:25:45,450
you have any thoughts on growing in

663
00:25:43,859 --> 00:25:47,729
containers versus growing directly in

664
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:51,390
ground yeah I mean that's like a whole

665
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:53,940
other podcast on its own I guess I I

666
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:56,100
think that the jury's still out on if

667
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:58,890
one is better than the other as far as

668
00:25:56,099 --> 00:26:00,539
the end result of what what you get out

669
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:03,240
of it I think it depends on your

670
00:26:00,539 --> 00:26:05,159
approach your methodology you know I

671
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:07,679
feel like container gardening allows

672
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:11,070
people more control and it probably

673
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:13,230
mimics mimics the world of like the

674
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:15,539
classic hydroponic style more just

675
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:17,308
because you you get more nutrient flow

676
00:26:15,539 --> 00:26:18,960
through and more water flow through in

677
00:26:17,308 --> 00:26:20,849
that case and if you're working in

678
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,299
native soils you'll see that the

679
00:26:20,849 --> 00:26:27,419
frequency of irrigating is much less and

680
00:26:23,299 --> 00:26:29,789
there that that comes down to your your

681
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:32,490
personal ethics and approach to farming

682
00:26:29,789 --> 00:26:35,279
as well as what kind of resources as far

683
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:37,829
as irrigation water and you know that

684
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:39,240
you have available to you I prefer like

685
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:41,009
here in Southern Oregon I mean we have

686
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:43,529
some amazing class ones

687
00:26:41,009 --> 00:26:46,019
oils and I've seen some cannabis farmers

688
00:26:43,529 --> 00:26:47,879
pull off amazing crops just going right

689
00:26:46,019 --> 00:26:49,440
into the native soil but they've

690
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:51,690
definitely had to change their growing

691
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,820
approach and it's really hard when

692
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:57,390
you've been growing in a in a certain

693
00:26:53,819 --> 00:26:59,039
way for you know 10 15 years or more and

694
00:26:57,390 --> 00:27:01,140
then you all of a sudden have to get to

695
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:02,940
where maybe our only irrigating once or

696
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:06,030
twice or three times a week at the most

697
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:08,610
so that's a farmer has to be willing to

698
00:27:06,029 --> 00:27:10,289
make that shift you know yeah I'm a big

699
00:27:08,609 --> 00:27:13,469
proponent of planting directly in the

700
00:27:10,289 --> 00:27:15,809
ground because owning a retail nursery

701
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:18,450
you can see the difference when you

702
00:27:15,809 --> 00:27:21,000
allow a plant to have as much root space

703
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:22,680
as it wants it gets much larger I have a

704
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,299
great example with our mulberries where

705
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:26,460
we have some in a container that are

706
00:27:24,299 --> 00:27:28,379
about two feet tall now after two years

707
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:30,960
and then I have one in the ground that's

708
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:32,760
over 80 tall same that was brought in at

709
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,740
the same time yep and like you mentioned

710
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:36,509
the ethics involved with using less

711
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:38,849
water you're going to keep the root zone

712
00:27:36,509 --> 00:27:41,129
temperature down which is probably good

713
00:27:38,849 --> 00:27:44,639
in your area because of the heat yep

714
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:46,110
there's so many benefits now you're not

715
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,570
just planting in a native ground I'm

716
00:27:46,109 --> 00:27:50,069
guessing you're probably doing some soil

717
00:27:48,569 --> 00:27:52,470
testing you want to talk about that a

718
00:27:50,069 --> 00:27:54,689
little bit oh sure yeah yeah I mean it

719
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:56,789
really depends on your specific locale

720
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:58,620
you know I mean there's a lot of the

721
00:27:56,789 --> 00:28:00,839
ground that people have been growing

722
00:27:58,619 --> 00:28:02,819
cannabis on for years have been these up

723
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:04,980
in the hills properties and so you find

724
00:28:02,819 --> 00:28:06,779
heavy heavy clay content up there which

725
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:09,299
could be a real challenge to grow in

726
00:28:06,779 --> 00:28:11,670
without doing some serious soil

727
00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:13,740
remediation down where I am in the

728
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:16,019
bottom of their River Valley a lot of

729
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:18,210
the cannabis farms that that surround us

730
00:28:16,019 --> 00:28:22,589
down here you know those are Class one

731
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:24,809
like super low me silty loam soils some

732
00:28:22,589 --> 00:28:27,779
of those there's little that needs to be

733
00:28:24,809 --> 00:28:29,879
done other than say liming or some pH

734
00:28:27,779 --> 00:28:32,190
balancing through that and some

735
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:35,420
mineralization and then just adding in

736
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:38,370
fertility into those into those soils

737
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:40,830
but yeah soil testings really where it's

738
00:28:38,369 --> 00:28:42,479
at that's it's something that I'm still

739
00:28:40,829 --> 00:28:45,569
on a learning curve with I am no expert

740
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:48,660
with understanding the intricacies of

741
00:28:45,569 --> 00:28:51,470
the full the full world of soil testing

742
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:54,980
I'm learning every year but since I've

743
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:58,190
actively done tests on my veggie

744
00:28:54,980 --> 00:29:01,069
ground over the last 10 years my my

745
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:03,500
understanding of my individual soils at

746
00:29:01,069 --> 00:29:06,259
the farm have grown immensely and it's

747
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:08,990
been really exciting to watch how it's

748
00:29:06,259 --> 00:29:11,539
changed due to what what kind of

749
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:13,429
amendments we put down and and even

750
00:29:11,539 --> 00:29:16,069
these like little nuance differences

751
00:29:13,429 --> 00:29:18,740
between one soil on this side of the

752
00:29:16,069 --> 00:29:20,119
property to another soil type on the

753
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:23,298
other side of the property and how they

754
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:25,729
respond differently and it is a balance

755
00:29:23,298 --> 00:29:29,359
to like I I just don't have the time to

756
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:31,039
spend countless hours like really

757
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:32,719
digging into all this because the

758
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:34,190
margins in the vegetable world are so

759
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,589
tight you know at the end of the day I

760
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:39,400
spend more time just getting product out

761
00:29:36,589 --> 00:29:41,689
of the field so that's the beauty of the

762
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:43,820
cannabis industry is that it's always

763
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:45,620
seen better margins so people have been

764
00:29:43,819 --> 00:29:47,750
able to focus more on that and that's

765
00:29:45,619 --> 00:29:50,269
something I've always been a bit envious

766
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:52,579
of is the ability for the cannabis

767
00:29:50,269 --> 00:29:55,190
industry to really dial in and look at

768
00:29:52,579 --> 00:29:56,689
specifics surrounding soils yeah you

769
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:58,519
bring up a really good point around soil

770
00:29:56,690 --> 00:30:01,250
testing and that it's it's simply just

771
00:29:58,519 --> 00:30:03,710
another tool like a shovel or a tractor

772
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:05,390
it's another way of gathering data that

773
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:09,289
you can use to make more informed

774
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:10,669
decisions about your land yep and you

775
00:30:09,289 --> 00:30:12,379
also brought up some other points that I

776
00:30:10,669 --> 00:30:14,509
thought was good so there are times when

777
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:16,520
it's not necessarily great to plant and

778
00:30:14,509 --> 00:30:18,679
land directly into the ground like when

779
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:20,720
you have very high clay soils I'd also

780
00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:23,990
mention if you had a lot of real heavy

781
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:25,579
brewing pests like rats or moles or

782
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:27,470
things like that then a container might

783
00:30:25,579 --> 00:30:29,750
make sense if you're in a floodplain

784
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:31,669
where you dig down and your water line

785
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:32,960
is really high close to the top surface

786
00:30:31,669 --> 00:30:35,120
of your soil then you may want to go

787
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,590
into container so yeah oh and if you

788
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:39,199
have really bad heavy metals or you're

789
00:30:36,589 --> 00:30:41,269
on remediated land so yeah those are

790
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,370
just other things I want to throw out

791
00:30:41,269 --> 00:30:45,319
there now let's talk a little bit about

792
00:30:43,369 --> 00:30:46,399
how you do fertilize your crops so you

793
00:30:45,319 --> 00:30:48,319
mentioned that you have different

794
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:50,450
programs for different crops where are

795
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:53,539
you were you getting your fertility yeah

796
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:54,259
so fertility for us comes from pelleted

797
00:30:53,539 --> 00:30:57,409
fertilizer

798
00:30:54,259 --> 00:31:00,319
it's a from the chicken manure world

799
00:30:57,410 --> 00:31:02,179
pelletized that's our pre plant

800
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:04,789
fertilized it's kind of like our broad

801
00:31:02,179 --> 00:31:07,370
spectrum what what we put out on the

802
00:31:04,789 --> 00:31:08,779
fields we focus a lot on cover cropping

803
00:31:07,369 --> 00:31:11,319
as far as fertility

804
00:31:08,779 --> 00:31:14,930
so sometimes nitrogen fixing cover crops

805
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:18,769
sometimes organic matter building cover

806
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:21,830
crops combos of both and then we also

807
00:31:18,769 --> 00:31:24,379
use a fish hydrolysate that we put into

808
00:31:21,829 --> 00:31:27,199
our irrigation systems either overhead

809
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:30,560
or through drip and then those are the

810
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:33,500
main fertility drivers for us and then

811
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:35,839
we also look at mineralization and our

812
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:39,259
mineral mineralization program has been

813
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:42,169
pretty like we haven't fine-tuned it to

814
00:31:39,259 --> 00:31:45,410
each specific crop because of honestly

815
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:47,240
just because of cost you know we just

816
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:48,850
have to keep cruising forward so we've

817
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:52,460
kind of had this general overview

818
00:31:48,849 --> 00:31:55,939
program you know using glacial rock dust

819
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:58,910
and azomite and other trace minerals

820
00:31:55,940 --> 00:32:00,890
like that and now actually my my

821
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:02,450
education curve on the whole world of

822
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:03,650
mineralization has really been growing

823
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:05,809
over the last several years and so

824
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:08,600
that's something I'm starting to dive

825
00:32:05,809 --> 00:32:11,809
into a little deeper but I I'm no expert

826
00:32:08,599 --> 00:32:14,089
on that yet but I can see the the value

827
00:32:11,809 --> 00:32:15,349
of that going forward are you doing

828
00:32:14,089 --> 00:32:19,669
anything from a biological perspective

829
00:32:15,349 --> 00:32:22,279
uh yeah I mean we we've used different

830
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:26,480
inoculants in our transplants in the

831
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:28,819
past and we've made tees in the past I I

832
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,860
haven't really and and what I always did

833
00:32:28,819 --> 00:32:34,279
with T's in the past and I've kind of

834
00:32:30,859 --> 00:32:36,439
scaled back on on tees because I there's

835
00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:37,730
kind of like a lot of a lot going on in

836
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:39,860
that world right now that I'm just kind

837
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:41,569
of the jury's out you know for right now

838
00:32:39,859 --> 00:32:43,219
but what I did for a long time just for

839
00:32:41,569 --> 00:32:45,710
for more than anything food safety

840
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:48,620
reasons just to keep my certifiers happy

841
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:51,470
was putting biological T's out on our

842
00:32:48,619 --> 00:32:53,359
cover crops and feeding the feeding the

843
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:56,240
cover crops instead of the food crops

844
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:59,000
and just with it the concept that the

845
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:00,980
biology would be there and inoculated in

846
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,660
those soils and then when we had those

847
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:04,730
soils turned under then we could come

848
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:06,259
back and follow with a food crop just

849
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:08,720
because there's a lot of there's a lot

850
00:33:06,259 --> 00:33:11,390
of debate over the world of using that

851
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:13,370
T's and like foodborne pathogens and all

852
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:14,930
that kind of stuff so that's that was

853
00:33:13,369 --> 00:33:18,369
our approach in the past and the last

854
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:21,740
several years I've found a really good

855
00:33:18,369 --> 00:33:22,699
point of I get I don't know if I guess

856
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:24,169
I'd call it

857
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:25,970
like I think of the biology in our

858
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:28,070
fields is really healthy right now and

859
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:29,989
I've just been watching that and we're

860
00:33:28,069 --> 00:33:32,089
having to fertilize less and less each

861
00:33:29,989 --> 00:33:34,759
year and we're just kind of going off of

862
00:33:32,089 --> 00:33:36,858
the bank of fertility and the biology

863
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:38,720
that's there and we're still seeing

864
00:33:36,858 --> 00:33:40,189
great results from the crops and I know

865
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,288
I'll have to shift that at some point

866
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:44,239
but that's kind of been our approach for

867
00:33:42,288 --> 00:33:47,868
right now so it seems like we have a

868
00:33:44,239 --> 00:33:50,929
pretty good stored Bank of fertility and

869
00:33:47,868 --> 00:33:52,579
we just keep observing now when you say

870
00:33:50,929 --> 00:33:55,820
teas are you talking about aerated

871
00:33:52,579 --> 00:33:57,918
compost Peas yeah I mean I've gone I I

872
00:33:55,819 --> 00:33:59,960
messed around with aerated compost teas

873
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:02,778
for a while and then I kind of got into

874
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:05,119
just doing more of compost extracts like

875
00:34:02,778 --> 00:34:08,898
a real quick extract where I wasn't

876
00:34:05,118 --> 00:34:10,578
actively bubbling and I'd kind of mess

877
00:34:08,898 --> 00:34:13,219
around with with everything whether it's

878
00:34:10,579 --> 00:34:15,919
been worm based teas or compost based

879
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:18,500
teas or or whatever but I honestly I

880
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:20,808
never really dove into it deep just

881
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:23,539
because again a lot of what I end up

882
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:26,269
doing on the vegetable farm it comes

883
00:34:23,539 --> 00:34:28,279
down to cost and time of how much energy

884
00:34:26,269 --> 00:34:29,449
I can put into it it's been an

885
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:32,059
interesting kind of like

886
00:34:29,449 --> 00:34:33,108
shoot-from-the-hip kind of project sure

887
00:34:32,059 --> 00:34:35,359
that makes a lot of sense

888
00:34:33,108 --> 00:34:37,068
now you mentioned either use some cover

889
00:34:35,358 --> 00:34:39,828
crops do you have some favorites in

890
00:34:37,068 --> 00:34:42,019
terms of actual actual varieties or

891
00:34:39,829 --> 00:34:44,720
anything like that yeah definitely and

892
00:34:42,019 --> 00:34:46,519
what I always tell folks what works here

893
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:48,108
in Southern Oregon may not work where

894
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:49,489
you're at and I think that's really

895
00:34:48,108 --> 00:34:51,139
important you just kind of have to

896
00:34:49,489 --> 00:34:53,239
experiment that's what I did

897
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:55,639
specifically the valley that we're in

898
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:57,769
here oats and peas work really well I

899
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:59,990
can plant oats and peas as late as

900
00:34:57,769 --> 00:35:02,179
December first and still get a nice

901
00:34:59,989 --> 00:35:03,588
stand before the spring it really

902
00:35:02,179 --> 00:35:05,899
depends on when I'm going to be

903
00:35:03,588 --> 00:35:08,869
harvesting or you know chopping that

904
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:10,548
that crop down in the spring so if I

905
00:35:08,869 --> 00:35:12,798
have more time to let it grow and say

906
00:35:10,548 --> 00:35:15,679
I'm not going to take a field out of

907
00:35:12,798 --> 00:35:17,900
cover crop until May or June then I can

908
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:21,649
get a really nice stand so that's my

909
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:24,650
overwintered go-to is oats and peas like

910
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:27,920
a Cayuse oat and a Austrian winter pea

911
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:29,809
I've done Ryan veg in the past there's

912
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:34,039
one of the things I learned the hard way

913
00:35:29,809 --> 00:35:36,530
was a and the annual rye is the thing to

914
00:35:34,039 --> 00:35:36,769
use and not a perennial rye I learned

915
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:40,430
the

916
00:35:36,769 --> 00:35:43,190
hardway on that one and and then during

917
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:44,960
the main growing season I've had great

918
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:47,900
success with su decks

919
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:51,050
like a Sudan cover crop for organic

920
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:53,570
matter building and weed suppression and

921
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:55,880
then I've used buckwheat a lot I really

922
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:58,970
like buckwheat as a crop because it's so

923
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:01,220
fast to grow it's like up and down in

924
00:35:58,969 --> 00:36:03,079
like six to eight weeks and a nice

925
00:36:01,219 --> 00:36:05,929
little phosphorous boost as well and

926
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:08,269
then if you can let it flower out before

927
00:36:05,929 --> 00:36:11,179
it really goes to seed it's a amazing

928
00:36:08,269 --> 00:36:12,259
attractor for beneficials those have

929
00:36:11,179 --> 00:36:15,049
been the main things I've worked with

930
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:17,840
I've tried some understory planting of

931
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:19,430
clovers and vetches that's really

932
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:23,000
challenging if you don't have your weed

933
00:36:19,429 --> 00:36:25,489
seed bank under control in her fields so

934
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,349
that's something that I would like to

935
00:36:25,489 --> 00:36:29,629
work with more in the future the last

936
00:36:27,349 --> 00:36:32,480
three or four years we've really focused

937
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:35,150
a lot on making sure that we're removing

938
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:38,090
our weed seed bank out of the soils and

939
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:40,280
so making sure that none of the weeds go

940
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:41,870
to flower anymore and that's making a

941
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:43,850
huge difference so once we get that

942
00:36:41,869 --> 00:36:46,309
under control I probably will start

943
00:36:43,849 --> 00:36:48,440
experimenting with more covers during

944
00:36:46,309 --> 00:36:49,880
Maine season is that a manual process

945
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:52,970
where you're actually going out and

946
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:55,190
physically plucking the weeds sometimes

947
00:36:52,969 --> 00:36:58,219
it is it's also about what we call bare

948
00:36:55,190 --> 00:37:00,289
fallow where we'll have a block that

949
00:36:58,219 --> 00:37:02,269
we're not growing in for a certain cycle

950
00:37:00,289 --> 00:37:05,029
that will go ahead and irrigate that

951
00:37:02,269 --> 00:37:06,800
block and then germinate the weed seeds

952
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:09,200
and then we go through and do a light

953
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:11,360
cultivation nothing deep or aggressive

954
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:13,369
just a light cultivation on the top to

955
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:16,670
knock those weeds out and we may do that

956
00:37:13,369 --> 00:37:19,069
for you know one two three cycles you

957
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:20,599
know will irrigate grow them up knock

958
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:22,760
them down grow them up knock them down

959
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:24,799
and then we'll plant a cover crop into

960
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:27,470
that area and let that grow up and then

961
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:29,630
chop and drop it that has been really

962
00:37:27,469 --> 00:37:31,669
good for us as well but but then yeah

963
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:33,590
it's also out in the field when we have

964
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:35,539
veggies growing just making sure that no

965
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:37,730
the weeds that do come up and make it

966
00:37:35,539 --> 00:37:39,769
they ever go to seed yeah that's great

967
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:41,539
and so you're you're actually telling

968
00:37:39,769 --> 00:37:43,460
these crowd your cover crops back into

969
00:37:41,539 --> 00:37:46,670
the soil then before you plant your next

970
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:50,119
crop yes yeah we usually will use a

971
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:53,090
flail mower just to really pulverize and

972
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:55,099
the soil to eat that cover crop up

973
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:56,870
quickly you know it depends on what kind

974
00:37:55,099 --> 00:37:59,750
of turnaround you want out of the field

975
00:37:56,869 --> 00:38:02,000
because the the smaller that we can make

976
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:05,539
the residue the faster the soil can you

977
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,920
know like eat it up you know and so

978
00:38:05,539 --> 00:38:09,019
that's that's kind of been our our

979
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:10,639
process yeah that makes sense you're

980
00:38:09,019 --> 00:38:12,619
increasing the surface area for the

981
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:14,210
microbes to be able to consume that

982
00:38:12,619 --> 00:38:15,619
great so let's talk a little bit about

983
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:18,019
some of the advocacy work you're doing

984
00:38:15,619 --> 00:38:20,059
so you have this upcoming living soil

985
00:38:18,019 --> 00:38:22,009
symposium that I'm really disappointed

986
00:38:20,059 --> 00:38:24,860
I'm gonna be out of town for I want to

987
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:27,200
go I know my buddy jaya palmer has been

988
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:28,670
a speaker in previous years and he raved

989
00:38:27,199 --> 00:38:30,559
about it i have a lot of friends that

990
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:32,420
have attended can you talk a little bit

991
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:34,909
about some of the the goals around that

992
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:37,639
and what what it is oh yeah sure

993
00:38:34,909 --> 00:38:40,009
so I founded the living soil symposium

994
00:38:37,639 --> 00:38:44,059
three years ago it really came out of

995
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:46,520
then I just saw the Greater agricultural

996
00:38:44,059 --> 00:38:48,679
community online talking about a lot of

997
00:38:46,519 --> 00:38:50,599
these techniques to take our farms

998
00:38:48,679 --> 00:38:54,049
beyond organic like what these next

999
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:56,239
steps would be but I also saw a lack of

1000
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:58,460
depth to community as far as the

1001
00:38:56,239 --> 00:38:59,779
communication goes online because

1002
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:02,179
there's only so much you can do with

1003
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:04,340
thumb typing your response you know you

1004
00:39:02,179 --> 00:39:06,409
just don't get as deep and so I said man

1005
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:08,450
we just really need to create a venue

1006
00:39:06,409 --> 00:39:11,089
for a lot of people that are similar

1007
00:39:08,449 --> 00:39:13,429
minded to get together and really go

1008
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:16,210
deep on some of these so that was the

1009
00:39:13,429 --> 00:39:19,250
real premise for why I created the event

1010
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:21,409
originally was just to get people

1011
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:22,760
together and have these interactive

1012
00:39:21,409 --> 00:39:25,909
conversations and we've always

1013
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:27,920
encouraged it to be a two-way street as

1014
00:39:25,909 --> 00:39:30,199
far as the audience interacting with the

1015
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:32,480
presenters and vice versa instead of

1016
00:39:30,199 --> 00:39:35,449
just being talked to by a you know in a

1017
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:37,400
PowerPoint presentation by no means do I

1018
00:39:35,449 --> 00:39:39,889
have the the structure of the symposium

1019
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:43,099
completely figured out yet every year is

1020
00:39:39,889 --> 00:39:45,589
a is another permutation of what the

1021
00:39:43,099 --> 00:39:47,960
previous year was and so we listen and

1022
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:50,030
observe what the community at large is

1023
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:53,179
saying and are trying to bring in a

1024
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:54,950
diverse set of presenters each year and

1025
00:39:53,179 --> 00:39:57,919
so like this year we we've really

1026
00:39:54,949 --> 00:40:00,049
expanded out into a lot of different

1027
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:03,920
traditions of farming whether it's

1028
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:06,859
whether it's permaculture or grazing or

1029
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:09,740
orchards or vineyards and hemp and

1030
00:40:06,858 --> 00:40:13,039
cannabis and even vegetable production

1031
00:40:09,739 --> 00:40:16,548
we're just really trying to widen our

1032
00:40:13,039 --> 00:40:19,039
reach and let the community realize that

1033
00:40:16,548 --> 00:40:21,019
there there's a lot of people out there

1034
00:40:19,039 --> 00:40:23,179
talking the same message even though we

1035
00:40:21,019 --> 00:40:25,548
might have a different crop that is our

1036
00:40:23,179 --> 00:40:26,588
you know that's our income crop so I'm

1037
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:28,670
hoping that there can be this

1038
00:40:26,588 --> 00:40:30,980
cross-pollination between these

1039
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:32,809
different methodologies of farming that

1040
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:35,030
we can find the commonality and then

1041
00:40:32,809 --> 00:40:37,640
come out of it being better better

1042
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:40,190
growers all together so that's the main

1043
00:40:37,639 --> 00:40:42,618
idea of what what I was trying to to do

1044
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:44,179
with creating the symposium so the

1045
00:40:42,619 --> 00:40:47,510
symposium this year is being held in

1046
00:40:44,179 --> 00:40:51,879
Portland it's starts on March 23rd

1047
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:54,230
through the 25th and it's not a cannabis

1048
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:57,048
symposium correct but you do have some

1049
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:59,420
cannabis yes some cannabis related

1050
00:40:57,048 --> 00:41:01,099
speakers and fest I see a good friend of

1051
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:02,539
mine here David Bernard Peron is going

1052
00:41:01,099 --> 00:41:04,880
to be one of your yep one of your

1053
00:41:02,539 --> 00:41:06,170
speakers for the weekend session yep is

1054
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,700
there anything else you want to

1055
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:09,108
highlight any any talks that you're

1056
00:41:07,699 --> 00:41:11,750
really looking forward to this year

1057
00:41:09,108 --> 00:41:13,940
people you haven't heard before um oh

1058
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:17,480
yeah I mean there's several folks that

1059
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:19,548
um I I brought on because I wanted to

1060
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:22,250
see how they would bring into the fold

1061
00:41:19,548 --> 00:41:24,289
there's Zakk Lok's he does he wrote a

1062
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:26,630
book called the permaculture Market

1063
00:41:24,289 --> 00:41:28,699
Garden I'm really intrigued by what he's

1064
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:30,890
doing where he's doing like a market

1065
00:41:28,699 --> 00:41:34,399
scale vegetable operation but with

1066
00:41:30,889 --> 00:41:36,828
permaculture design in mind a portland

1067
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:39,710
local Peter McCoy he has radical

1068
00:41:36,829 --> 00:41:43,369
mycology I think that we're gonna see

1069
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:46,250
what an important place fungi play in

1070
00:41:43,369 --> 00:41:48,980
agriculture going forward so I I wanted

1071
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:50,750
to bring his voice in and I I think the

1072
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:53,990
overall thing that I really want people

1073
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:56,929
to understand is that I tried to look at

1074
00:41:53,989 --> 00:41:59,058
the symposium as a curriculum a weekend

1075
00:41:56,929 --> 00:42:02,000
curriculum as a whole so we're hoping

1076
00:41:59,059 --> 00:42:04,339
that there's some there's some synergy

1077
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,679
between one presenter and another

1078
00:42:04,338 --> 00:42:08,389
presenter that one presenter can fill in

1079
00:42:06,679 --> 00:42:10,429
a piece of the puzzle and the next

1080
00:42:08,389 --> 00:42:13,219
presenter can fill in another piece of

1081
00:42:10,429 --> 00:42:15,259
the puzzle so like our friend Sam from

1082
00:42:13,219 --> 00:42:17,989
soil sand biotics he talks a lot about

1083
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:20,090
mineralization and then I have

1084
00:42:17,989 --> 00:42:21,859
this fella Dan Kitteridge who's part of

1085
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:25,010
the bio nutrient Association and he

1086
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:26,480
focuses on nutrient density and crops so

1087
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:29,270
I'm hoping that there can be a

1088
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:31,610
continuation of education between those

1089
00:42:29,269 --> 00:42:33,469
two guys presentations that that Sam can

1090
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:35,809
talk about the science and the specifics

1091
00:42:33,469 --> 00:42:37,819
behind mineralization and the importance

1092
00:42:35,809 --> 00:42:39,980
of it and then Dan can connect the dots

1093
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:41,360
to how that translates to the food that

1094
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:44,119
we're actually eating or the cannabis

1095
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:46,490
we're actually consuming so I'm I'm

1096
00:42:44,119 --> 00:42:48,260
working hard on that and the one thing

1097
00:42:46,489 --> 00:42:50,509
that I'm I know is kind of the most

1098
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:52,490
out-there idea that we're hitting on

1099
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:54,320
this year is I have a group of folks

1100
00:42:52,489 --> 00:42:57,709
that are we're going to be actually

1101
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:59,750
looking at the social like we're the

1102
00:42:57,710 --> 00:43:02,659
social permaculture of the event so

1103
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:05,449
basically I have folks that are going to

1104
00:43:02,659 --> 00:43:07,279
look at the design of the event and

1105
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:10,159
they're going to be observing the event

1106
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:12,980
as if they were visiting a farm to

1107
00:43:10,159 --> 00:43:15,319
implement a permaculture design onto

1108
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:17,630
that farm so like what what is the

1109
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:20,960
cultural structure of our event and what

1110
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:23,900
can we do to improve it so it has the

1111
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:25,940
proper way the proper flow with systems

1112
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:28,130
management you know and that's it's kind

1113
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:30,139
of this esoteric and out-there idea that

1114
00:43:28,130 --> 00:43:32,809
I had but I think it's really worth it

1115
00:43:30,139 --> 00:43:35,269
to look at the culture that's driving

1116
00:43:32,809 --> 00:43:37,099
the event is just as important as the

1117
00:43:35,269 --> 00:43:39,320
information that we're getting out at

1118
00:43:37,099 --> 00:43:41,029
the event so that that's something that

1119
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:43,460
I'm I'm really excited about as well I

1120
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:45,290
think that's a great I mean one of the

1121
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:47,269
great things about permaculture is since

1122
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:49,250
it is design system you can really apply

1123
00:43:47,269 --> 00:43:52,789
it to anything and people are applying

1124
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:54,949
it to the technology industry to just

1125
00:43:52,789 --> 00:43:57,019
about just about anything you can

1126
00:43:54,949 --> 00:43:58,519
imagine so I think it's wonderful that

1127
00:43:57,019 --> 00:44:01,130
you're looking at the social aspect

1128
00:43:58,519 --> 00:44:02,690
there yeah I'm really excited that

1129
00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:04,220
you're putting on this event and I think

1130
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:05,980
it's still something in the industry

1131
00:44:04,219 --> 00:44:08,419
that's been needed needing to happen and

1132
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:11,030
it's definitely gaining traction so I

1133
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:13,099
hope people will definitely go and check

1134
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:14,390
it out if they haven't heard of it or if

1135
00:44:13,099 --> 00:44:16,880
they haven't gotten their tickets yet is

1136
00:44:14,389 --> 00:44:19,039
there still room available oh yeah their

1137
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:21,079
tickets are available yeah they're going

1138
00:44:19,039 --> 00:44:21,949
to be available the tickets closed March

1139
00:44:21,079 --> 00:44:25,069
17th

1140
00:44:21,949 --> 00:44:27,019
because we do serve lunch both days we

1141
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:29,150
kind of need to know our numbers so the

1142
00:44:27,019 --> 00:44:30,829
sooner that people get their tickets the

1143
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:31,789
better for us just so we know how many

1144
00:44:30,829 --> 00:44:34,518
people took

1145
00:44:31,789 --> 00:44:35,929
and we can prepare accordingly but yeah

1146
00:44:34,518 --> 00:44:39,228
the tickets are out there you can get

1147
00:44:35,929 --> 00:44:41,568
tickets for there's a Friday farm visit

1148
00:44:39,228 --> 00:44:43,218
to a farm right outside of Portland

1149
00:44:41,568 --> 00:44:45,949
that's more of a hands-on practical

1150
00:44:43,219 --> 00:44:47,838
experience those tickets are limited to

1151
00:44:45,949 --> 00:44:50,269
just a hundred tickets available for

1152
00:44:47,838 --> 00:44:53,179
that and then the Saturday and Sunday

1153
00:44:50,268 --> 00:44:56,208
sessions you can get a ticket to one or

1154
00:44:53,179 --> 00:44:58,459
both sessions you know so it's just

1155
00:44:56,208 --> 00:45:00,438
really whatever people can fit into

1156
00:44:58,458 --> 00:45:02,748
their schedule I highly encourage people

1157
00:45:00,438 --> 00:45:04,699
to come and be part of the community

1158
00:45:02,748 --> 00:45:07,848
discussion that's something I've been

1159
00:45:04,699 --> 00:45:10,338
focusing a lot on is making sure is that

1160
00:45:07,849 --> 00:45:13,068
the audience is stacked just as strong

1161
00:45:10,338 --> 00:45:15,349
as our list of presenters because that

1162
00:45:13,068 --> 00:45:17,838
is really important to me because it is

1163
00:45:15,349 --> 00:45:19,969
a it is a dialogue between the entire

1164
00:45:17,838 --> 00:45:22,369
community and so the stronger we can

1165
00:45:19,969 --> 00:45:25,099
make the entire the entire group of

1166
00:45:22,369 --> 00:45:28,249
people the better I feel yeah Jaya came

1167
00:45:25,099 --> 00:45:29,899
back super energized from from the last

1168
00:45:28,248 --> 00:45:31,158
one that he attended talking about how

1169
00:45:29,898 --> 00:45:33,380
it's just a wonderful group of people

1170
00:45:31,159 --> 00:45:35,659
and especially the audience itself

1171
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:37,159
having like-minded people in the same

1172
00:45:35,659 --> 00:45:39,380
room they've been able to share all

1173
00:45:37,159 --> 00:45:41,838
their ideas because everyone has a story

1174
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:43,880
and everyone has experience so that's

1175
00:45:41,838 --> 00:45:45,288
that's really great now was there

1176
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:47,329
anything else he wanted you wanted to

1177
00:45:45,289 --> 00:45:50,209
cover before we sign off did you want to

1178
00:45:47,329 --> 00:45:53,209
talk any more related to farming or the

1179
00:45:50,208 --> 00:45:54,798
symposium or anything else no I just I

1180
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:56,239
just want your listeners to know how

1181
00:45:54,798 --> 00:45:58,639
glad I am that you're doing this podcast

1182
00:45:56,239 --> 00:46:00,619
I think it the more people that can do

1183
00:45:58,639 --> 00:46:03,139
podcasts like this to really get the

1184
00:46:00,619 --> 00:46:05,149
message out about about what we can

1185
00:46:03,139 --> 00:46:06,588
what's really possible for us going

1186
00:46:05,148 --> 00:46:09,018
forward in agriculture it's really

1187
00:46:06,588 --> 00:46:11,028
exciting to me so I just applaud you for

1188
00:46:09,018 --> 00:46:12,468
the work that you're doing Ted well

1189
00:46:11,028 --> 00:46:14,358
let's follow up again maybe after the

1190
00:46:12,469 --> 00:46:15,889
symposium and see if you can share some

1191
00:46:14,358 --> 00:46:17,538
of the things that you learned at the

1192
00:46:15,889 --> 00:46:19,519
symposium and some of the exciting new

1193
00:46:17,539 --> 00:46:22,069
in new things going on in the industry

1194

1200
00:46:32,630 --> 00:46:36,648
up for the living soil symposium this

1201
00:46:34,188 --> 00:46:38,118
year and I look forward to talking soon

1202
00:46:36,648 --> 00:46:40,338

1203
00:46:38,119 --> 00:46:42,318
have a good one Ted all right so Chris

1204
00:46:40,338 --> 00:46:44,509
I'm having you back on the show today to

1205
00:46:42,318 --> 00:46:45,559
talk a little bit about the living soil

1206
00:46:44,509 --> 00:46:47,300
symposium

1207
00:46:45,559 --> 00:46:50,389
you know when we first recorded the show

1208
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:51,830
we were talking up the symposium and I

1209
00:46:50,389 --> 00:46:54,529
was so excited for what you guys were

1210
00:46:51,829 --> 00:46:57,889
doing and then some things happened and

1211
00:46:54,530 --> 00:46:59,510
the show was canceled so I wanted to use

1212
00:46:57,889 --> 00:47:01,519
this as a platform to talk a little bit

1213
00:46:59,510 --> 00:47:03,800
about that process sort of what happened

1214
00:47:01,519 --> 00:47:05,960
and let listeners kind of into your

1215
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:08,990
brain and what's been going on oh yeah

1216
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:10,190
for sure so yeah thanks for having me

1217
00:47:08,989 --> 00:47:13,519
back on Ted I think it's really

1218
00:47:10,190 --> 00:47:15,380
important for me to you know relay the

1219
00:47:13,519 --> 00:47:17,570
message and kind of things that I've

1220
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:20,269
learned after the fact now that we've

1221
00:47:17,570 --> 00:47:23,809
had to cancel the symposium really it

1222
00:47:20,269 --> 00:47:26,179
came down to ticket sales for us we had

1223
00:47:23,809 --> 00:47:28,579
we knew that the ticket sales had been

1224
00:47:26,179 --> 00:47:30,739
low but the previous two years they'd

1225
00:47:28,579 --> 00:47:33,319
been low until the last two weeks we had

1226
00:47:30,739 --> 00:47:35,000
previous two years we had sold a large

1227
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:37,130
majority of our tickets in the last two

1228
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:40,429
weeks but this year once I checked in

1229
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:43,640
with my team I saw that they were just

1230
00:47:40,429 --> 00:47:47,179
not there this year and we were watching

1231
00:47:43,639 --> 00:47:49,969
how fast or slow they had been going and

1232
00:47:47,179 --> 00:47:51,949
started kind of doing the math and said

1233
00:47:49,969 --> 00:47:55,339
man there is no way that we're going to

1234
00:47:51,949 --> 00:47:57,739
be able to reach our break-even point in

1235
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:59,150
the next three weeks so at that time we

1236
00:47:57,739 --> 00:48:01,250
had like three weeks of ticket sales

1237
00:47:59,150 --> 00:48:03,829
left I think it was because we had a

1238
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:05,960
cut-off date seven to ten days before

1239
00:48:03,829 --> 00:48:09,440
the actual event so we could get plate

1240
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:10,820
counts for the meals for both days so we

1241
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:13,550
said there's no way that we're going to

1242
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:16,070
reach that that number in the next three

1243
00:48:13,550 --> 00:48:18,019
weeks it just it just won't happen and

1244
00:48:16,070 --> 00:48:20,769
so it was a matter it really came down

1245
00:48:18,019 --> 00:48:23,480
to a business decision of sorts it was I

1246
00:48:20,769 --> 00:48:27,500
could cancel the event

1247
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:29,960
now which has been about a week ago as

1248
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:32,389
you and I are talking right now and I

1249
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:35,570
can lose the money on all of my deposits

1250
00:48:32,389 --> 00:48:37,789
on all the event space and and the extra

1251
00:48:35,570 --> 00:48:41,120
costs that that I had already invested

1252
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:44,389
or I could try to see if we could

1253
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:47,719
weather the storm and really make a move

1254
00:48:44,389 --> 00:48:50,659
to sell tickets but even then if I

1255
00:48:47,719 --> 00:48:53,000
didn't find that break-even point then I

1256
00:48:50,659 --> 00:48:54,710
was going to lose about another twenty

1257
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:58,010
thousand dollars on top of what I was

1258
00:48:54,710 --> 00:48:59,360
already losing and so for me I had to

1259
00:48:58,010 --> 00:49:01,910
make that decision and

1260
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:04,550
eh I just have to call this this is just

1261
00:49:01,909 --> 00:49:06,710
not this is just not going to work and

1262
00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:10,039
and that really comes down to it was my

1263
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:12,320
own personal financial responsibility

1264
00:49:10,039 --> 00:49:13,579
and so I had to make that decision from

1265
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:16,100
my standpoint because I didn't have a

1266
00:49:13,579 --> 00:49:18,889
backer on any of this at all it's just

1267
00:49:16,099 --> 00:49:20,809
been you know my own my own money to

1268
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:23,659
bootstrap this whole thing from the

1269
00:49:20,809 --> 00:49:25,340
beginning so this was your your vision

1270
00:49:23,659 --> 00:49:27,379
this symposium and it was something that

1271
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:30,559
you put together out of your passion for

1272
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:33,200
this style of cultivation and farming

1273
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:34,670
and when you say you were your ticket

1274
00:49:33,199 --> 00:49:36,559
sales were low I know you and I talked

1275
00:49:34,670 --> 00:49:37,909
we're not talking you know 10 or 20

1276
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:40,730
tickets we're talking hundreds of

1277
00:49:37,909 --> 00:49:42,139
tickets low so it was a yeah it was

1278
00:49:40,730 --> 00:49:44,119
really a financial decision on your part

1279
00:49:42,139 --> 00:49:47,000
to cancel this show and I know it wasn't

1280
00:49:44,119 --> 00:49:48,859
an easy decision for you yeah I'm sure

1281
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:51,170
it's been you've gotten some feedback

1282
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:52,849
I'm sure I've seen some both positive

1283
00:49:51,170 --> 00:49:55,430
and negative feedback on your Instagram

1284
00:49:52,849 --> 00:49:56,569
page setup' then do you want to talk a

1285
00:49:55,429 --> 00:49:58,239
little about sort of the emotional

1286
00:49:56,570 --> 00:50:00,980
process you went through with this and

1287
00:49:58,239 --> 00:50:02,599
have any comments to the people who left

1288
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:05,449
both you know positive and negative

1289
00:50:02,599 --> 00:50:08,779
feedback on there oh yeah yeah um well

1290
00:50:05,449 --> 00:50:11,089
first of all I would say I listened to

1291
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:14,000
all the feedback and I don't think that

1292
00:50:11,090 --> 00:50:16,850
I don't think any of the feedback was

1293
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:20,000
out of line at all really um you know I

1294
00:50:16,849 --> 00:50:21,529
I'm really good at critiquing myself I

1295
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,960
mean being a farmer you kind of have to

1296
00:50:21,530 --> 00:50:26,510
be good at critiquing yourself there was

1297
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:29,119
a lot of things that I I took chances on

1298
00:50:26,510 --> 00:50:31,940
that I shouldn't have we thought that

1299
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:34,789
there was a greater a greater capacity

1300
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:37,820
for the event this year and so we found

1301
00:50:34,789 --> 00:50:41,599
a bigger space that could facilitate a

1302
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:43,309
larger a larger group of people and that

1303
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:45,949
meant that we had to move up to Portland

1304
00:50:43,309 --> 00:50:47,509
because I didn't find a space down here

1305
00:50:45,949 --> 00:50:49,669
in Southern Oregon where I'd had it the

1306
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:51,320
previous two years that could hold that

1307
00:50:49,670 --> 00:50:53,480
number of people that was a mistake on

1308
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:56,630
my part this the move I totally

1309
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:58,849
understand that the added cost of of

1310
00:50:56,630 --> 00:51:01,820
having a bigger space meant that my

1311
00:50:58,849 --> 00:51:05,509
upfront costs were more so I was more on

1312
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:08,450
the line for for making sure that I sold

1313
00:51:05,510 --> 00:51:11,270
X a number of tickets I definitely

1314
00:51:08,449 --> 00:51:13,348
realized in the world of running an

1315
00:51:11,269 --> 00:51:15,900
event like this once you start

1316
00:51:13,349 --> 00:51:18,660
baling up it becomes more challenging to

1317
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:22,108
do it with a minimal number of sponsors

1318
00:51:18,659 --> 00:51:23,368
and not having a tradeshow I think that

1319
00:51:22,108 --> 00:51:26,489
and that was something that I was trying

1320
00:51:23,369 --> 00:51:28,890
to avoid was having a trade show that

1321
00:51:26,489 --> 00:51:30,838
brings in money and having a lot of

1322
00:51:28,889 --> 00:51:32,368
sponsorships that brings in a lot of

1323
00:51:30,838 --> 00:51:37,108
money I was really trying to keep it

1324
00:51:32,369 --> 00:51:39,720
into a symposium atmosphere of of really

1325
00:51:37,108 --> 00:51:42,808
critical thinking about being clouded by

1326
00:51:39,719 --> 00:51:44,699
sales of products or trying to pitch

1327
00:51:42,809 --> 00:51:47,130
products or whatever and so that was a

1328
00:51:44,699 --> 00:51:48,598
big lesson for me that doesn't mean that

1329
00:51:47,130 --> 00:51:50,700
if in the future if I was going to do

1330
00:51:48,599 --> 00:51:52,739
something more that I would I would

1331
00:51:50,699 --> 00:51:54,358
definitely have a trade show and have a

1332
00:51:52,739 --> 00:51:56,338
ton of sponsors I just think that I

1333
00:51:54,358 --> 00:51:58,469
would look at a different a different

1334
00:51:56,338 --> 00:52:00,719
format probably those were some of the

1335
00:51:58,469 --> 00:52:02,818
things the other thing that I saw as far

1336
00:52:00,719 --> 00:52:06,568
as comments were that it was too

1337
00:52:02,818 --> 00:52:08,190
expensive those that that cost that I

1338
00:52:06,568 --> 00:52:10,858
was charging for the event for the two

1339
00:52:08,190 --> 00:52:13,619
days was basically a break-even cost for

1340
00:52:10,858 --> 00:52:16,679
us because I didn't have a ton of

1341
00:52:13,619 --> 00:52:19,019
sponsorships and because I didn't have a

1342
00:52:16,679 --> 00:52:21,808
tradeshow and the fact that we were

1343
00:52:19,018 --> 00:52:23,968
working really hard to pay all of the

1344
00:52:21,809 --> 00:52:26,489
presenters properly this year and in

1345
00:52:23,969 --> 00:52:29,429
years past people had done it for free

1346
00:52:26,489 --> 00:52:31,829
and even though a lot of people still

1347
00:52:29,429 --> 00:52:34,618
wanted to do that we were trying you

1348
00:52:31,829 --> 00:52:36,900
know to pay everybody fairly to present

1349
00:52:34,619 --> 00:52:39,450
and it wasn't a lot but it was like but

1350
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:41,639
once you have the amount of people that

1351
00:52:39,449 --> 00:52:43,768
we had presenting this year once you

1352
00:52:41,639 --> 00:52:46,498
multiply it by that many people it adds

1353
00:52:43,768 --> 00:52:48,959
up to a chunk of a chunk of cash to get

1354
00:52:46,498 --> 00:52:51,358
people there so that was really the

1355
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:53,608
reason for the increase in the ticket

1356
00:52:51,358 --> 00:52:55,308
price this year and I know that the

1357
00:52:53,608 --> 00:52:58,259
state of Agriculture right now

1358
00:52:55,309 --> 00:52:59,609
especially the cannabis industry I had a

1359
00:52:58,259 --> 00:53:01,710
lot of people reach out to me and say

1360
00:52:59,608 --> 00:53:03,119
hey man we came last year but we just

1361
00:53:01,710 --> 00:53:05,639
can't afford to come this year because

1362
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:07,170
the financial state of the cannabis

1363
00:53:05,639 --> 00:53:11,848
industry especially here in Oregon right

1364
00:53:07,170 --> 00:53:14,130
now is really on rocky ground and and so

1365
00:53:11,849 --> 00:53:17,039
and that is a big part of my demographic

1366
00:53:14,130 --> 00:53:18,450
is the cannabis community and I get it

1367
00:53:17,039 --> 00:53:21,390
where they're coming from I'm seeing it

1368
00:53:18,449 --> 00:53:23,248
all around and then there were there

1369
00:53:21,389 --> 00:53:24,929
were the people outside of cannabis that

1370
00:53:23,248 --> 00:53:26,459
were just in agriculture together that

1371
00:53:24,929 --> 00:53:27,118
just said you know we're kind of burned

1372
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:30,929
out on

1373
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:33,180
on conferences and this to them it just

1374
00:53:30,929 --> 00:53:36,298
seemed like another conference and that

1375
00:53:33,179 --> 00:53:38,879
was probably our myself and my team's

1376
00:53:36,298 --> 00:53:41,009
fault for not not putting the message

1377
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:43,079
out there stronger as to how we were

1378
00:53:41,009 --> 00:53:44,429
going to differentiate ourselves and so

1379
00:53:43,079 --> 00:53:48,539
that's something that I'm learning from

1380
00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:50,578
as well that just allowing a conference

1381
00:53:48,539 --> 00:53:52,859
or symposium like this to grow

1382
00:53:50,579 --> 00:53:54,568
organically it worked really well in the

1383
00:53:52,858 --> 00:53:57,298
first two years just word of mouth but

1384
00:53:54,568 --> 00:53:59,460
as we were kind of growing up I think

1385
00:53:57,298 --> 00:54:02,518
that we probably should've earmarked a

1386
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:06,059
much bigger chunk of our budget towards

1387
00:54:02,518 --> 00:54:09,748
pushing posts to people paid advertising

1388
00:54:06,059 --> 00:54:12,180
paid marketing out to the out to all the

1389
00:54:09,748 --> 00:54:14,578
people and that's something that that I

1390
00:54:12,179 --> 00:54:15,929
am looking into for the future how I

1391
00:54:14,579 --> 00:54:17,999
would approach things differently

1392
00:54:15,929 --> 00:54:20,159
because honestly in the last year a lot

1393
00:54:17,998 --> 00:54:21,959
of the algorithms in the world of

1394
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:24,210
Instagram and Facebook have changed and

1395
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:27,210
I don't think that we were as we're as

1396
00:54:24,210 --> 00:54:29,130
aware of that as we are now just that

1397
00:54:27,210 --> 00:54:31,829
the organic reach is just not the same

1398
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:34,048
it was a year ago so all of those things

1399
00:54:31,829 --> 00:54:36,359
together I think were major contributors

1400
00:54:34,048 --> 00:54:38,219
and there were you know smaller other

1401
00:54:36,358 --> 00:54:41,389
other factors too but it's like that's

1402
00:54:38,219 --> 00:54:43,798
it's like there's like the overall

1403
00:54:41,389 --> 00:54:45,900
takeaway is that the ticket sales were

1404
00:54:43,798 --> 00:54:48,748
just low and that's that's kind of where

1405
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:50,818
we're at yeah I love the idea that being

1406
00:54:48,748 --> 00:54:53,368
in Portland since I'm up in the Seattle

1407
00:54:50,818 --> 00:54:55,650
area being able to bring people down

1408
00:54:53,369 --> 00:54:57,630
from Washington out of the 502 market -

1409
00:54:55,650 --> 00:55:00,719
yep be able to attend as well I think is

1410
00:54:57,630 --> 00:55:02,729
amazing you touched on a lot of things

1411
00:55:00,719 --> 00:55:05,759
there that I think are all really

1412
00:55:02,728 --> 00:55:07,379
important one thing I know I had talked

1413
00:55:05,759 --> 00:55:09,028
with some with some good friends in the

1414
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:10,318
industry about doing it something

1415
00:55:09,028 --> 00:55:12,838
similar to what you were doing like a

1416
00:55:10,318 --> 00:55:14,460
symposium and there are all these

1417
00:55:12,838 --> 00:55:17,400
challenges and even with this podcast

1418
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:20,789
I've avoided having advertising on here

1419
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:22,380
or anything because there's so many

1420
00:55:20,789 --> 00:55:24,329
issues around that in terms of what

1421
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:27,028
products that you personally support or

1422
00:55:24,329 --> 00:55:28,528
feel are you know created ethically and

1423
00:55:27,028 --> 00:55:30,900
that you would even want at a tradeshow

1424
00:55:28,528 --> 00:55:32,849
and once you go that route it's really

1425
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:34,950
it's a slippery slope when when money

1426
00:55:32,849 --> 00:55:36,660
starts coming in and saying no to some

1427
00:55:34,949 --> 00:55:39,808
people and yes to others I think is a

1428
00:55:36,659 --> 00:55:40,299
real challenge so I commend you in that

1429
00:55:39,809 --> 00:55:41,920
in

1430
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:44,950
staying with that symposium forum and

1431
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:46,809
I'm really hopeful that next year we can

1432
00:55:44,949 --> 00:55:48,279
generate enough interest and I'd love to

1433
00:55:46,809 --> 00:55:49,929
you know come on board and help out as

1434
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:51,820
much as I can from the outside in

1435
00:55:49,929 --> 00:55:53,949
promoting what you're doing because I

1436
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:57,010
think it's so important that we get this

1437
00:55:53,949 --> 00:55:58,989
information out to the wider the wider

1438
00:55:57,010 --> 00:56:02,830
audience both in cannabis and in farming

1439
00:55:58,989 --> 00:56:04,059
yep yep yeah and I think it it's I think

1440
00:56:02,829 --> 00:56:06,579
that that's something that I'm taking

1441
00:56:04,059 --> 00:56:09,940
away from this is that when you are

1442
00:56:06,579 --> 00:56:14,170
trying to trying to put a message that's

1443
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:17,650
this big and this diverse out there

1444
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:20,710
which really I mean honestly the living

1445
00:56:17,650 --> 00:56:22,840
soils moniker was really just saying

1446
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:25,300
nature you know like we're just all

1447
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:27,789
trying to find our own pattern

1448
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:29,590
recognition of nature so whenever you're

1449
00:56:27,789 --> 00:56:32,139
trying to take something on that big

1450
00:56:29,590 --> 00:56:33,250
like it's gonna take some time and I

1451
00:56:32,139 --> 00:56:35,980
think that that's something that I'm

1452
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:39,099
realizing is that this is this is a long

1453
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:40,929
path that I'm taking and it's not like I

1454
00:56:39,099 --> 00:56:42,909
I don't think that I took that as

1455
00:56:40,929 --> 00:56:45,639
seriously as I should have as far as

1456
00:56:42,909 --> 00:56:48,730
like how much work it takes to affect

1457
00:56:45,639 --> 00:56:50,650
culture in a healthy way and so that's

1458
00:56:48,730 --> 00:56:52,900
something that I'm I'm taking note of

1459
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:55,570
it's like we need to keep pushing

1460
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:57,639
forward with this this educational

1461
00:56:55,570 --> 00:57:00,460
message and I just have to be patient

1462
00:56:57,639 --> 00:57:03,519
you know like I really view this as a

1463
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:05,710
hiccup in the road and other than the

1464
00:57:03,519 --> 00:57:07,509
fact that it it it kind of sucks for me

1465
00:57:05,710 --> 00:57:10,630
financially in the short term in the

1466
00:57:07,510 --> 00:57:13,720
long term I know that the that the end

1467
00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:15,130
result is is and can be a really good

1468
00:57:13,719 --> 00:57:17,409
thing I just have to be patient with

1469
00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:19,480
that well I'm glad to hear that you're

1470
00:57:17,409 --> 00:57:22,119
still moving forward with everything and

1471
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:23,920
not too discouraged by this and I hope

1472
00:57:22,119 --> 00:57:26,159
that listeners and people that were

1473
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:29,619
attending you know attendees were

1474
00:57:26,159 --> 00:57:31,420
open-minded to the greater situation the

1475
00:57:29,619 --> 00:57:32,769
perspective here in terms of what you

1476
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:34,150
you're going through and the energy

1477
00:57:32,769 --> 00:57:36,190
you're putting into this and what it's

1478
00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:37,150
costing you financially for you and your

1479
00:57:36,190 --> 00:57:38,500
family

1480
00:57:37,150 --> 00:57:40,420
one thing you touched on with the

1481
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:43,239
symposium that I think is really the

1482
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:44,980
coolest thing about it is that you're

1483
00:57:43,239 --> 00:57:47,019
when you say that living soils is just

1484
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:48,909
is just nature we have and this is

1485
00:57:47,019 --> 00:57:50,259
something we talked about off-air we

1486
00:57:48,909 --> 00:57:53,139
have all these different ways of

1487
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:53,770
cultivation and farming you know in our

1488
00:57:53,139 --> 00:57:55,889
community

1489
00:57:53,769 --> 00:57:59,469
terms of you know Korean natural farming

1490
00:57:55,889 --> 00:58:01,539
permaculture probiotic farming you know

1491
00:57:59,469 --> 00:58:03,730
you have all these bio dynamics all

1492
00:58:01,539 --> 00:58:06,699
these different styles or methodologies

1493
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:10,869
that are all slightly different but all

1494
00:58:06,699 --> 00:58:12,480
organic and all looking to looking to

1495
00:58:10,869 --> 00:58:15,909
promote ethical and sustainable

1496
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:18,490
cultivation and farming and what I love

1497
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:20,049
about your symposium is it's getting all

1498
00:58:18,489 --> 00:58:22,089
these people together to where if you're

1499
00:58:20,050 --> 00:58:23,769
an open minded human being an individual

1500
00:58:22,090 --> 00:58:25,600
there's something to learn from every

1501
00:58:23,769 --> 00:58:27,039
group you know each one is going to be

1502
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:28,449
slightly different but each one has a

1503
00:58:27,039 --> 00:58:30,969
really powerful message that we can

1504
00:58:28,449 --> 00:58:32,409
share and all learn from each other so

1505
00:58:30,969 --> 00:58:34,480
that maybe we don't have to have all

1506
00:58:32,409 --> 00:58:36,730
these separate groups that are divided

1507
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:38,530
tribes but rather just united under this

1508
00:58:36,730 --> 00:58:41,769
idea of trying to save the environment

1509
00:58:38,530 --> 00:58:43,660
and trying to grow sustainably yep I

1510
00:58:41,769 --> 00:58:46,179
agree and I you know the analogy that

1511
00:58:43,659 --> 00:58:48,429
I've been using in all of this is like

1512
00:58:46,179 --> 00:58:50,230
I've I just view it as speaking

1513
00:58:48,429 --> 00:58:52,089
different languages and then you have to

1514
00:58:50,230 --> 00:58:53,650
get everybody in one room it's kind of

1515
00:58:52,090 --> 00:58:55,269
like when you see the United Nations

1516
00:58:53,650 --> 00:58:56,500
kind of get together and meet and you

1517
00:58:55,269 --> 00:58:59,170
see all these people with different

1518
00:58:56,500 --> 00:59:01,360
headsets on that have their the

1519
00:58:59,170 --> 00:59:03,280
translation is happening like that's

1520
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:05,140
really what I viewed the symposium to be

1521
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:07,240
was a place where people are speaking

1522
00:59:05,139 --> 00:59:08,949
different languages but at the end of

1523
00:59:07,239 --> 00:59:11,229
the day we're all basically speaking the

1524
00:59:08,949 --> 00:59:13,089
same language it's just how we're going

1525
00:59:11,230 --> 00:59:14,829
about presenting it you know and so

1526
00:59:13,090 --> 00:59:17,950
that's that's something that I keep in

1527
00:59:14,829 --> 00:59:19,480
mind in all of this very cool well was

1528
00:59:17,949 --> 00:59:21,929
anything else you wanted to cover in

1529
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:23,619
terms of the symposium itself or

1530
00:59:21,929 --> 00:59:26,980
anything else you want to say to

1531
00:59:23,619 --> 00:59:29,739
listeners regarding what was going on no

1532
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:31,179
I mean nothing other than some folks

1533
00:59:29,739 --> 00:59:33,789
have already reached out to me with

1534
00:59:31,179 --> 00:59:35,949
brainstorming ideas of how they would

1535
00:59:33,789 --> 00:59:39,119
like to see things go forward or what

1536
00:59:35,949 --> 00:59:41,799
their ideas are to to make things

1537
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:44,019
continue this educational path continue

1538
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:45,820
and I so I just encourage people to keep

1539
00:59:44,019 --> 00:59:48,400
reaching out to us with their ideas and

1540
00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:50,260
I also encourage people to take it into

1541
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:53,260
their own hands if they see that they

1542
00:59:50,260 --> 00:59:55,150
can create a group of like-minded folks

1543
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:57,070
are open-minded folks in their own

1544
00:59:55,150 --> 00:59:59,470
communities that you should start

1545
00:59:57,070 --> 01:00:01,300
creating events small micro events

1546
00:59:59,469 --> 01:00:03,459
yourselves you know and that's one idea

1547
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:04,930
that I've really really resonated with

1548
01:00:03,460 --> 01:00:06,159
over the last week as several people

1549
01:00:04,929 --> 01:00:07,848
have said well I'm just going to start

1550
01:00:06,159 --> 01:00:10,489
my own event here and then maybe

1551
01:00:07,849 --> 01:00:12,950
we can meet up at the symposium each

1552
01:00:10,489 --> 01:00:14,269
year to kind of share our regional ideas

1553
01:00:12,949 --> 01:00:16,788
and I'm like yeah that's great that's

1554
01:00:14,268 --> 01:00:19,278
like so if if nothing else maybe this is

1555
01:00:16,789 --> 01:00:21,170
a this kind of like bump in the road is

1556
01:00:19,278 --> 01:00:23,210
a catalyst for other folks to realize

1557
01:00:21,170 --> 01:00:25,729
that they can take you know take that

1558
01:00:23,210 --> 01:00:29,420
power in their own hands so sort of like

1559
01:00:25,728 --> 01:00:31,960
a TED Talks thing with tax yeah exactly

1560
01:00:29,420 --> 01:00:34,519
kind of like a you know doing their own

1561
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:36,710
their own because that's the thing is

1562
01:00:34,518 --> 01:00:38,689
like what we realize is that all of our

1563
01:00:36,710 --> 01:00:40,190
farms are different you know and so and

1564
01:00:38,690 --> 01:00:41,869
that could be a regional difference too

1565
01:00:40,190 --> 01:00:43,970
and so like there's folks in Colorado

1566
01:00:41,869 --> 01:00:47,028
that said we're going to start a small a

1567
01:00:43,969 --> 01:00:48,798
small gathering out here of folks and

1568
01:00:47,028 --> 01:00:50,568
talk about the same topics that you'd be

1569
01:00:48,798 --> 01:00:52,818
talking about the symposium and then all

1570
01:00:50,568 --> 01:00:55,219
of them would love to come to get

1571
01:00:52,818 --> 01:00:56,358
together in a yearly celebration of what

1572
01:00:55,219 --> 01:00:57,588
they're learning and share it with

1573
01:00:56,358 --> 01:00:59,748
others you know something like that I

1574
01:00:57,588 --> 01:01:01,478
don't know it's it's it's it's all about

1575
01:00:59,748 --> 01:01:03,768
brainstorming together as a community

1576
01:01:01,478 --> 01:01:05,868
that's that's brilliant I love it I

1577
01:01:03,768 --> 01:01:07,518
would love to I'd love to talk to you

1578
01:01:05,869 --> 01:01:08,900
further about that and maybe we can I

1579
01:01:07,518 --> 01:01:11,328
mean you're down in Southern Oregon I'm

1580
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:13,249
