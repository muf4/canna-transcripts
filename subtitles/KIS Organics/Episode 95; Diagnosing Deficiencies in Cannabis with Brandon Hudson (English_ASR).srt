grew row crops and were advocates of the

34
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:26,719

77
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:54,959
i grew up in east tennessee smokey

78
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:59,360
mountains with a twin brother and little

79
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:01,840
sister and we spent all of our childhood

80
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,159
running around in the woods and

81
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,719
that's a theme i hear with a little

82
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:07,840
podcast interviews actually is it seems

83
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:09,759
like

84
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,000
everybody that

85
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:15,759
that is on the same track has always had

86
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,080
some kind of passion or love for plants

87
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:21,280
our parents were hippies

88
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,120
in the 70s the whole back to the earth

89
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,120
back to the land movement so they were

90
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,439
they were growing row crops and my mom

91
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,319
was canning and pickling

92
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:32,878
so we grew up in the fields and

93
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:34,238
my mom's my real plan and

94
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:36,000
yes she's

95
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,878
she was a professional horticulturalist

96
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,280
for many years and maintained

97
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:42,878
beautiful floral gardens still in

98
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,560
tennessee

99
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:47,598
she has a little sister

100
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:50,239
for evergreen in virginia the um

101
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:52,079
carter family folds

102
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,239
and she's got some funny stories about

103
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,959
cussing out johnny cash for parking his

104
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,120
bus where she needed to move soil and

105
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,598
stuff like that um but so i've always

106
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,959
been around hippies and plants

107
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:06,158
um

108
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:08,080
so when i got into college and uh got

109
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:10,158
into

110
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,959
the grateful dead and

111
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:14,719
uh that community um

112
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,439
it's really came

113
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:20,879
full circle back into my life because

114
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:22,959
my dad grew uncles grew you know my my

115
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:25,680
entire family they're that era they're

116
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:28,000
that age where they were aged in the 70s

117
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,400
and you know they all they all smoked

118
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,439
and it really wasn't a

119
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:34,879
big deal and then uh in the 80s

120
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,399
you know that's the height of the just

121
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:38,159
say no era

122
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:39,599
everybody kind of took it underground

123
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,360
and got quiet about it and so it really

124
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,320
wasn't on my radar again at a knowledge

125
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,919
and then

126
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:47,680
you know it's like salt and pepper for

127
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:49,599
dead heads so it goes

128
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,639
dang and just became a big part of my

129
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,080
life and

130
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,879
immediately

131
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:57,758
i was attracted wanting to grow it and

132
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:59,360
um you know ed rosenthal has that great

133
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,520
quote about how

134
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:05,439
addictive but growing it is and i would

135
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:07,519
have to concur with that wholeheartedly

136
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:11,360
and then you know so i i

137
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:13,758
started trying and i had a autonomy

138
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,759
knowledge

139
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:19,120
my first attempt

140
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:22,240
home and my mom had found it

141
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,600
and so the dead plants and the light

142
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,639
my bed

143
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,840
and so uh 35 years later

144
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,079
you know i just

145
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:32,239
hadn't kept at it and uh back in those

146
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:33,680
days you know you had a couple of books

147
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,680
by ed rosen

148
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:39,600
there's the robert connell clark books

149
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,800
and you know my dad had a bunch of um

150
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,280
underground

151
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,120
underground growing books um but back

152
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:47,839
then you couldn't even take notes

153
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,600
you know it was just really scary

154
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:53,279
and um i

155
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,800
ohio state i met a guy at a party

156
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:56,719
i was actually hanging out with some

157
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,560
friends and a guy came in

158
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,080
super straight and everybody got really

159
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,600
nervous and

160
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:04,399
my buddy started laughing and was like

161
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:07,280
that's the brought the the real g13 and

162
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:09,359
so if anybody knows the the g13 history

163
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:12,478
that was coming out of dayton

164
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,240
um i i got to meet that guy at a party

165
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:17,599
and

166
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,879
he he kind of opened some doors for me

167
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,800
you know it was really hard to get

168
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:22,879
lighting it was really hard to get a

169
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,639
solid grip on

170
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:26,560
fertilizer regimens and that kind of

171
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,478
stuff back in those days and he sent me

172
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,959
to a florist a traditional or not a

173
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:33,680
florist but a traditional

174
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:36,560
cultivation store and i went in not like

175
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,160
a hydro store or anything i went in and

176
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,759
it looked like the mom-and-pop place i

177
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,680
was kind of nervous to say anything but

178
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,759
i went up to the counter and said you

179
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,240
know his his password name was bobby

180
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:48,000
brady because he he literally looked

181
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,720
like bobby brady from the brady bunch

182
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,560
and

183
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,560
as soon as i told him that they that

184
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,839
bobby brady had sent me

185
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,000
they um

186
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:57,519
sent a hippie looking kid out who took

187
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,800
me into a back room and showed me a

188
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:02,879
bunch of grow lights and

189
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:06,160
that was that was where i really got

190
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:08,639
some of the basics and um

191
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,199
just kept kept at it and those guys

192
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:14,079
really knew their thing they they were

193
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,840
conscious of ipm they they knew lighting

194
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:18,399
they knew how to cure

195
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:20,560
they were really ahead of their time

196
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:23,439
and so it was just really lucky to to

197
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,560
meet those guys and

198
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:26,160
got the

199
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,918
opportunity eventually to run a

200
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,080
commercial facility

201
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:33,359
in south carolina for four and a half

202
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:34,318
five years doing hemp flour on scale

203
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,879
um

204
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,560
knocking out 20 000 cuttings at a time

205
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:40,478
so you know just

206
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,839
really got to

207
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:46,000
fine-tune

208
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:49,198
everything from propagation to um

209
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,399
to harvest and cure on scale

210
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,478
and so that was a really great

211
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:53,120
experience for me got to work with a lot

212
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:56,399
of

213
00:07:53,120 --> 00:08:00,319
you know local organic farms

214
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:02,719
got to do some uh hemp trials for a

215
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,879
hbcu in the state

216
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,800
and um

217
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,000
then eventually

218
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,560
got to

219
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,360
work at kiss organics with you guys and

220
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:16,160
so that's where i am now and i'm helping

221
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:19,038
clients and doing soil reports and uh

222
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:21,199
it's really exciting

223
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:22,800
yeah well we're excited to have you and

224
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:26,400
you bring a lot of experience to the

225
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:28,240
table and i wanted to

226
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:30,638
sort of start off the podcast talking

227
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,278
about this idea of

228
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,879
from a grower's perspective how how do

229
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:38,399
you approach a grow i know you and i

230
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:38,399
have had a conversation about this

231
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,000
you know talking about limiting factors

232
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,560
can you kind of uh

233
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,320
delve into that a little bit

234
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:48,239
yeah i think that's a great place to

235
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,399
start and and that's one of the things i

236
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,240
do is answer a lot of calls from you

237
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:55,039
know not just beginning growers but

238
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:58,320
growers who are getting exposed to scale

239
00:08:55,039 --> 00:09:00,000
as cannabis has become legalized and

240
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,278
there's a lot of folks coming into it

241
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,759
without a strong traditional agronomy

242
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:08,720
background and

243
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:11,120
so to to approach things on scale it's

244
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,680
really important i think to start with a

245
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,839
you know a list of limiting factors

246
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:17,519
you know there's always going to be

247
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,240
your weak link and that's going to be

248
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:23,440
the thing that's slowing you down

249
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:26,560
you know it's agronomy is so um

250
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,240
interesting and so uh just

251
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:31,039
infinitely interesting because it's not

252
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,799
a closed system there's you know

253
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:34,799
interactions with all the different

254
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:37,439
phases and interactions with all the

255
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:40,240
different uh limiting factors and

256
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:43,440
you know you've got your your par your

257
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:45,120
ppfd range your relative humidity you

258
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,600
know what's your water quality your

259
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:51,519
irrigation events you know how how how

260
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:55,120
do you water you know what's the temp

261
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:56,240
ipm pests viruses you know cannabis

262
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,919
growers are

263
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:02,879
unfortunately in

264
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:06,399
infamous for passing around viruses and

265
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:09,919
insects and so you know i think that

266
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:11,360
the community has has is getting a lot

267
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:12,559
better about that and people are

268
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,278
starting to really understand that

269
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:16,559
quarantining and even things like tissue

270
00:10:15,278 --> 00:10:19,278
control and that kind of stuff are

271
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:21,679
really important but you know you you

272
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:24,799
have to kind of dial in a metric for

273
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:27,120
each one of those limiting factors and

274
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:28,078
nutrients is one of them

275
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,399
um

276
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:33,359
and so we're lucky that you know well

277
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,720
it's not a closed system like i said in

278
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,639
controlled

279
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,600
ag controlled cultivation

280
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:42,399
environmentally controlled agriculture

281
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,959
we can control a lot of the limiting

282
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:47,039
factors and so we can

283
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:49,439
you know optimize

284
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:52,078
our production you know always looking

285
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,560
at margins and and you know input costs

286
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:56,719
that with one eye and you know for you

287
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:58,559
know your final harvest with the with

288
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,040
the other eye but

289
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:02,958
you know we're able to optimize our our

290
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:04,159
growth because we can control a lot of

291
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:05,119
those things

292
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:08,879
and so

293
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:11,200
for me as a an organic grower

294
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:14,000
the tricky thing is

295
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,839
the nutrients in your soil and you know

296
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,720
or organics

297
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,010
it's it's only been in the last

298
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,079
10

299
00:11:19,009 --> 00:11:22,799
[Music]

300
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:23,919
15 years you know but really 10 years

301
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:25,838
where we've

302
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:28,799
been able to

303
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:31,920
you know get a basic npk value for for

304
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:33,599
an input and that sort of thing and um

305
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:34,639
so it's made it really

306
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,600
tricky

307
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:39,519
for growers to

308
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,120
be 100 confident that they've got all

309
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,600
the nutrients in that soil that they

310
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,320
need you know and and so that's why you

311
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,480
know

312
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:49,120
i know you do i i do i

313
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,959
live and die by soil reports but as an

314
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,639
experienced grower i think it's really

315
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:55,838
important that you can

316
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:58,399
you can physically visually id your

317
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:00,399
plants you know you can't you can't test

318
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:03,519
you can't afford to test every single

319
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:05,519
plant in a 12 000 square foot greenhouse

320
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,600
you can't do that and so you need to be

321
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,919
able to read it visually

322
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:13,278
and determine if you've got you know

323
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:15,360
environmental issues pest issues

324
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:18,159
pathogen issues

325
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,519
watering issues nutrients

326
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:21,439
you know and

327
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:23,440
dial those dial those things in but if

328
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,040
you can visually recognize them

329
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,760
you can you can get ahead of them before

330
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:29,838
it becomes a problem

331
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:33,039
yeah so this this podcast in particular

332
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:35,040
is going to be focused on

333
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:37,759
nutrients and limiting factors with

334
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:40,000
nutrients but from a grower perspective

335
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:42,319
i think it's important and i know when i

336
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,159
go out and do consultations and things

337
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,839
i'm putting on like a detective's hat

338
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:47,360
and essentially i'm trying to figure out

339
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,120
what's the current limiting factor of

340
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:52,480
growth because there's always something

341
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,759
that's going to be limiting the plant

342
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,120
you know like you mentioned it could be

343
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:57,120
light it could be pests it could be

344
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:01,200
nutrients it could be watering it can be

345
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:02,959
all of those any one of those things so

346
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,600
as a grower what i want to do is

347
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:08,559
eliminate as many variables as i can

348
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:11,040
and then figure out which variable focus

349
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:13,278
on one variable the one that i think is

350
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:15,278
the one that's probably most key

351
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:16,240
to um

352
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:18,480
you know

353
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,399
eliminating the the lowest hanging fruit

354
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,000
essentially what the limiting factor is

355
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,360
and then once that's corrected there'll

356
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,679
be a new limiting factor that i'm

357
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,919
looking at so maybe initially

358
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:30,479
uh for example it's the way that i'm

359
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:32,319
watering i'm over watering i'm leaching

360
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,720
nutrients i'm stressing the plant and

361
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,959
killing root hairs so once that's

362
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,560
corrected well now i find that maybe my

363
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:41,039
light levels are a little bit lower than

364
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:43,039
they could be to be optimized and so now

365
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:44,639
i'm focused on raising my light levels

366
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:46,559
and then after that it may be something

367
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:49,198
else so you're always going through this

368
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:50,559
process and from a nutrient perspective

369
00:13:49,198 --> 00:13:53,838
something that you and i have talked a

370
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:55,599
bit about quite a bit off air is

371
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,720
if we're trying to diagnose a nutrient

372
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,759
problem

373
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,120
and we know that it is indeed nutrients

374
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:03,759
it goes beyond

375
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,440
just a soil test so we can't just take a

376
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:07,120
soil test and know everything that we

377
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,839
need to know about

378
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,679
a particular soil

379
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,600
we need to have a conversation with the

380
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:15,759
grower we need to know how do the plants

381
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,120
actually look because

382
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:18,720
there are all these variables and

383
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,879
genetics is one of the biggest ones

384
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,560
there and certain plants

385
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:25,039
that people are growing are going to be

386
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:27,119
more sensitive to nitrates for example

387
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:29,120
or might need slightly more phosphorus

388
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:32,000
so there is no standard calculator that

389
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,679
we can use that's going to give us

390
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,519
optimal fertility it can definitely

391
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:37,278
point us in the right direction but it

392
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,679
really is that conversation with the

393
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:41,600
grower or that the grower needs to have

394
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:42,559
with themselves to really figure out

395
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,440
what's

396
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:47,518
optimal for the particular plants

397
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,440
in in their environment

398
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,198
so i just want people to start thinking

399
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,519
about that and then

400
00:14:51,198 --> 00:14:56,000
as we start narrowing it down

401
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:58,639
then eliminating variables like i

402
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,839
mentioned so

403
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:04,159
going back to just using water you know

404
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:06,079
in clean water

405
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:08,078
rather than have adding all of these

406
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:09,120
other teas or knf products because i

407
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:11,439
know

408
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,519
sorry i'm almost done here i know people

409
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,560
will think like okay i want to get into

410
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,240
knf

411
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:18,719
and so i'm going to start doing water

412
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,879
soluble calcium but you need to take a

413
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,120
step back and say does my plant actually

414
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:24,720
need that calcium if the soil is already

415
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,879
high in calcium well we may be

416
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,680
compounding an already existing problem

417
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:31,360
by raising ph by eliminating other

418
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:32,399
cations

419
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,000
so

420
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,839
it's sort of that conversation that

421
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,159
growers need to have in their heads or

422
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,440
with a professional to really

423
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:42,879
dial in

424
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,880
uh their cultivation process so

425
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:45,838
that's i just wanted to share a little

426
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:49,039
about that

427
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:51,759
but let's go into um

428
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:55,039
what a dichotomous key is and and start

429
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:56,879
talking about uh you know these

430
00:15:55,039 --> 00:16:00,078
these nutrients and how they might

431
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:02,720
display on a given plant so

432
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:04,399
uh yeah talk to me about that

433
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,920
so but i'll just before we jump into

434
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:07,360
that i just want to echo again what you

435
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:09,439
just said about

436
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,159
it's really important to take that

437
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,680
holistic approach there is no one you

438
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:15,360
know as somebody who lives and dies by

439
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:18,239
soil reports

440
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:20,079
i still know that there's there's no one

441
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,759
calculator or

442
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:24,799
you know there's no way to just put your

443
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:27,120
numbers into uh into a spreadsheet and

444
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:28,078
kick out what you need and like calcium

445
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,399
is a

446
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:32,399
favorite of mine you know look at

447
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:34,480
you know you can have tons of calcium in

448
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,159
your soil and your relative humidity is

449
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,320
too high and you're not going to have

450
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:41,120
any in your tissue and so there's

451
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:44,000
there's such a

452
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,679
you really do have to take that holistic

453
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,360
1000 foot view

454
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:49,439
and look at all the different factors

455
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,240
and see how they you know what's your

456
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:55,600
target for that factor how close are to

457
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:58,079
you are are you to that target and then

458
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,320
what you can do to you know move

459
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:02,799
incrementally towards that

460
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:05,439
um so yeah i just i just wanted to touch

461
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:06,879
back on that but as far as a dichotomous

462
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,880
key

463
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:14,480
one of the really big you know like i

464
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:14,480
said i've got 35 36 years of active

465
00:17:14,558 --> 00:17:18,879
experience with cultivating that plant

466
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:23,119
you

467
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:25,198
are going to invariably start to learn

468
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:28,159
you know this is what wind burn on the

469
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:30,720
on a leaf looks like or you know all the

470
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,480
different environmental and nutritional

471
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,038
issues that you can run into you'll

472
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,880
start to just know those um just year

473
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:37,839
after year after year

474
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,760
um

475
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:42,079
but trying to teach you know when i when

476
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:44,480
i got to the hemp farm and i had people

477
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:47,599
working for me and i wanted them to be

478
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,519
able to scout and

479
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:52,399
trying to teach somebody

480
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:55,119
35 years of memorization it just doesn't

481
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,600
work well and so i

482
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:59,199
really wanted a path

483
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:00,480
that somebody could follow to make a

484
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,160
decision

485
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,798
and feel comfortable about it that they

486
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:07,120
were they were dealing with a nutrient

487
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:09,759
issue that they could narrow down and so

488
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:11,759
a dichotomous key is just you know

489
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:15,200
i think everybody's used one in high

490
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:18,558
school biology or on a field guide but

491
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:22,160
it basically gives you a question

492
00:18:18,558 --> 00:18:25,119
and you can go one one direction or the

493
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:28,080
other depending on on the answer

494
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:29,439
and just a quick scouting note um you

495
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:31,038
know if

496
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,960
if it is

497
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:35,759
suspected that you've got a pest or a

498
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:38,079
pathogen um you really

499
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:40,480
first step as crucial as getting that

500
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:44,079
id'd you know having having the right

501
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:47,839
scopes and that kind of stuff to do that

502
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:50,960
but regular scouting and knowing where

503
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:53,199
your nutrient issue starts on your plant

504
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,840
is is crucial

505
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,880
but when you first

506
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:59,279
approach a

507
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:02,000
a canopy you know

508
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:04,160
a quadrant a cultivar and that's one of

509
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,160
the issues i see is

510
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,840
you know in

511
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,360
you'll you'll see somebody's canopy and

512
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:10,959
they'll have certain number of plants of

513
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:14,240
this cultivar and a certain number of

514
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,240
these and you can't really

515
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,720
treat those as one canopy you need to

516
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:21,440
look at each cultivar as a canopy to

517
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:24,798
look for nutrient issues but on a

518
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:26,640
dichotomous key as far as nutrients

519
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:28,639
the first thing you know you've got a

520
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,320
symptom on a plant a plant doesn't look

521
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,520
good it doesn't look healthy

522
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:33,918
and the first thing you need to

523
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:35,918
determine is is that a nutrient issue or

524
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:39,120
is it something else you know so it's

525
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:40,799
either biotic you know something living

526
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:42,079
think pests and pathogens or it's

527
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:44,079
abiotic

528
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:46,079
and then you've got either a nutrient or

529
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:47,519
environmental issue

530
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:50,319
and

531
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:53,440
so when you're looking at you know a

532
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:55,759
specific cultivar or a specific area of

533
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,160
your

534
00:19:55,759 --> 00:20:02,400
your canopy you want to see if you're

535
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,400
seeing patterns and if you're seeing

536
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:08,480
an entire area affected

537
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:10,400
you most likely have

538
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,240
an abiotic

539
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,880
issue you know if it's if it's across

540
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,798
the board if you have you know one plant

541
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,440
that affected and then it jumps over to

542
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:21,200
another one you're probably looking at

543
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:24,240
something that's biotic you've probably

544
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,240
got a pest you know that's jumped from

545
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,720
you know one plant skipped over another

546
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,880
one jumped onto another one and you know

547
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:33,440
unless you've let a pest or pathogen

548
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,960
problem go way too far but you know

549
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,240
hopefully if you're scouting you would

550
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,079
know that

551
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,759
um but once you you know you've

552
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:41,279
determined if you've got a pattern or

553
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:43,519
not and you can look at an individual

554
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:46,000
plant you know you can look at leaves

555
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:48,960
and you know if you've got

556
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,679
a dead area like a necrotic spot on a

557
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:54,798
plant it's just on one

558
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:57,120
leaflet on on one leaf grouping

559
00:20:54,798 --> 00:20:59,200
then you know that makes me think uh

560
00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:00,479
again that you've got a biotic issue

561
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,960
because it's not

562
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,640
repeating throughout the entire plant

563
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,120
now if you could fold that leaf over and

564
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,720
so you've got like a marginal

565
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:10,079
um

566
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,640
yellowing or

567
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:15,439
necrosis or chlorosis um if you've got

568
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,960
that along that the edge and that

569
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,038
repeats throughout the plant then you're

570
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,960
pretty comfortable that you've got a an

571
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:23,759
abiotic issue it's either your

572
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,720
environment or your nutrients

573
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:26,879
and so

574
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,960
once you you've determined that you've

575
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:32,400
seen a pattern and you know that you've

576
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,759
got an abiotic issue and as a you know a

577
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,880
controlled

578
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:37,119
grower

579
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,200
you should have a pretty good idea of

580
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:41,839
your your targets for all of your

581
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:44,080
limiting factors and as long as you're

582
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:45,279
meeting those then you can feel pretty

583
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:47,519
comfortable that you're looking at a

584
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:48,879
nutrient issue and that's where you

585
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:51,599
would want to start

586
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,120
making you know use of the dichotomous

587
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:55,119
key really the first step in the

588
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:57,038
dichotomous key is to determine if it's

589
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:59,199
biotic or abiotic

590
00:21:57,038 --> 00:22:00,879
then the the next step

591
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,038
would be to you know like i mentioned

592
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,120
earlier you really really need to pay

593
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:07,119
attention to where the nutrient issue

594
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:08,879
started on the plant did it start at the

595
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:11,279
bottom the top or

596
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,520
the whole plant all at once

597
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:14,879
and the reason that's important is that

598
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:16,319
empowers you

599
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,280
to know whether you're dealing with a

600
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:20,480
mobile element or an immobile element

601
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:22,240
um

602
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,480
tell me if you want me to take a breath

603
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,880
here but i'll i'll just keep going

604
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,679
through this if you like

605
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,360
but

606
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:31,280
if you are looking at mobile and

607
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:33,038
immobile elements you know obviously all

608
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:34,879
elements are going to be mobile they

609
00:22:33,038 --> 00:22:37,038
have to be able to be

610
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:41,400
brought into the plant but what we're

611
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:41,400
talking about is can it be translocated

612
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:47,279
within the plant and so obviously the

613
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:50,879
most important areas on the plant are

614
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:51,839
the apical points the the growing tips

615
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,720
and the

616
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:56,798
root tips and the shoot tips

617
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,960
and those are you know for reproductive

618
00:22:56,798 --> 00:23:02,319
reasons and for growth reasons those are

619
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:03,200
prioritized over the other tissue in the

620
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:05,439
plant

621
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,038
and so if you've got a mobile element

622
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,798
you're going to see that show up on the

623
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:11,119
bottom of your plant because it's going

624
00:23:08,798 --> 00:23:12,879
to be sacrificed and translocated to

625
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:14,798
those growing tips to keep them

626
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,360
optimally growing

627
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:19,679
if you have an immobile element it can't

628
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:21,678
be translocated and so

629
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,798
it's going to show up on those growing

630
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:23,759
tips

631
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:26,400
and so

632
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:28,000
um you know so something like calcium or

633
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,960
phosphorus you know where you need it

634
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,880
for

635
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,480
root development or

636
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,799
you know um

637
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:38,400
flower development

638
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:40,639
you know you you'll be able to determine

639
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,400
by looking at the

640
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,720
symptoms on the plant

641
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,080
which which ones you're dealing with

642
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:49,759
and so

643
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:51,759
we could start with the mobile elements

644
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:53,519
that's a that's a

645
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:56,319
one that there's several of those that

646
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:58,879
people are very familiar with

647
00:23:56,319 --> 00:24:02,319
nitrogen obviously is the

648
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:05,360
the nutrient issue that we see the most

649
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:06,720
in cannabis um not necessarily a bad

650
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:08,639
thing you know especially as you're

651
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:12,000
heading into flowers you want to see

652
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:13,120
your nitrogen numbers taper down and so

653
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,440
you know that's

654
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:17,519
that's not really a deficiency that we

655
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:20,240
worry about but that's a good way for a

656
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:22,400
grower to know without a tissue sample

657
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,519
that his nitrogen is winding down as

658
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,200
they're

659
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:27,200
moving towards flour

660
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:30,000
but so if you want to go through those

661
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,840
mobile nutrients

662
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,919
again we've set it up as a dichotomous

663
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:36,639
key so you know you've decided you've

664
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:39,038
got an abiotic issue you've decided that

665
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,720
the issue is started on the bottom of

666
00:24:39,038 --> 00:24:41,679
your plant so we're going to go with

667
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,720
mobile

668
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:46,400
and so then you want to start looking at

669
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:49,278
visual symptoms and there's a lot of

670
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,798
visual symptoms that um are going to be

671
00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:54,159
similar

672
00:24:50,798 --> 00:24:56,079
and then a note as well

673
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:59,520
usually you know like especially like

674
00:24:56,079 --> 00:25:01,519
with a ph or an irrigation problem

675
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:03,038
you're going to see a lot of

676
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:05,519
you're going to see multiple symptoms

677
00:25:03,038 --> 00:25:07,599
you're not going to just see one symptom

678
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:09,519
you know if your roots are damaged it's

679
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:11,519
not just nitrogen that's not getting

680
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:13,519
into your plant it's everything and so

681
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:14,960
that's just a that's a note that can

682
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:17,119
also kind of if you you know if you're

683
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:20,079
seeing a bunch of stuff going going

684
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:21,918
haywire you know check that ph first of

685
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:24,000
all you know go go back to some of the

686
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:28,080
basics but if you're seeing just some

687
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:30,960
yellowing at the bottom of your plant

688
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:34,720
some chlorosis everybody's seen that and

689
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:37,038
that's nitrogen or phosphorus

690
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,798
pretty easy to differentiate those a

691
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:40,879
couple different ways

692
00:25:38,798 --> 00:25:43,359
if you've got leaf obsission

693
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:45,440
meaning that if you give that a lower

694
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:47,359
leaf that's yellow if you give it a

695
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,679
little tug or a little snap it'll pop

696
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:52,558
right off the plant or if the leaf is

697
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:55,120
just yellow and falling off

698
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:58,079
you've got nitrogen issues if

699
00:25:55,119 --> 00:26:01,199
if the plant is you know a dark green

700
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:02,480
and the lower leaf yellowing

701
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,278
begins to

702
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:07,360
you know go necrotic on the tips

703
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:09,200
and they don't pop off

704
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:12,000
then you've got phosphorus you know

705
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,840
another another phosphorus clue you know

706
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,759
don't be afraid to pull a plant out of a

707
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:18,079
pot you know especially on scale if

708
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:19,759
you're using smaller pots pop some out

709
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:21,759
and look at those roots if you've got

710
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:23,359
short clubby roots you may have a

711
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:25,919
phosphorus issue

712
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:28,879
um you know and then phosphorus

713
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:30,080
everybody is always talking about how

714
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:33,679
um

715
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:35,759
you know purpling as a sim sign for

716
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:38,240
phosphorus and sometimes potassium and i

717
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:40,480
just like to warn folks that that's not

718
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,839
always the smoking gun that it might

719
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,319
seem to be

720
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:46,158
based on cultivar

721
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:48,879
based on temperature

722
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:51,600
you know those anthocyanins can build up

723
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:53,200
sugars can build up and so there's a lot

724
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:54,558
of things that can make that purpling

725
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,519
happen

726
00:26:54,558 --> 00:26:59,599
um and so you know if if you've got the

727
00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:01,918
chlorosis on the lower leaves you're

728
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:03,199
looking at nitrogen or phosphorus and

729
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:05,600
you know that we've got some ways to

730
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,278
determine which one of those and then if

731
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:09,199
you were looking at the lower leaves and

732
00:27:07,278 --> 00:27:12,558
you get the the

733
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:15,120
tiger striping the interveinal chlorosis

734
00:27:12,558 --> 00:27:16,558
you get that lack of pigment between the

735
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:18,639
veins

736
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:21,519
that's one of the easiest to diagnose

737
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:24,559
that's magnesium and the way to prove it

738
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:28,000
to yourself and remedy it is with an

739
00:27:24,558 --> 00:27:30,558
epson foliar obviously you don't want to

740
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,759
spray anything on a flowering plant but

741
00:27:30,558 --> 00:27:35,519
in veg

742
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:36,319
you can go ahead and do a one tablespoon

743
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:37,599
to

744
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:40,398
one gallon

745
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:42,639
spray and you'll have results within 24

746
00:27:40,398 --> 00:27:44,639
to 48 hours and that's that's a really

747
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,960
easy way to know that that was a

748
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:50,159
magnesium issue

749
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,360
potassium everybody's seen potassium

750
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:53,039
it's the

751
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:56,678
when you're talking about the margin the

752
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:59,679
edge of the leaf um if you see yellowing

753
00:27:56,679 --> 00:28:02,320
chlorosis coming in on the margins and

754
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:06,798
then quickly going to necrosis you've

755
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:08,960
got you know as a band not just the tips

756
00:28:06,798 --> 00:28:10,720
but as a band along the edge of the leaf

757
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,640
it's

758
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,839
really really solid evidence that you're

759
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:17,520
dealing with the potassium

760
00:28:14,839 --> 00:28:19,519
issue and again that's you know once

761
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:20,960
you've scouted and eliminated pests and

762
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:22,480
that sort of thing

763
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,720
but that that gives you a really easy

764
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:27,200
way to see the bottom of the plant and

765
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,960
those mobile elements

766
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,038
partially can i jump in real quick

767
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:34,480
brandon so uh two thoughts i had the

768
00:28:31,038 --> 00:28:36,480
first was with potassium the other

769
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,839
clue i see is when i talk to a grower

770
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,240
and they're like man my plant looks

771
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:42,158
really good but it's i've run this

772
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,640
cultivar before and it's just i'm just

773
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:47,278
not getting that like bulking

774
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:49,440
density that i normally see in flower

775
00:28:47,278 --> 00:28:51,839
usually when i see a soil test

776
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:55,440
associated with that

777
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:58,558
we find low potassium so that's an easy

778
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:00,640
easy easy kind of clue also to watch for

779
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:02,319
with uh with potassium i just want to

780
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:05,360
mention that

781
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:07,918
no i agree 100 and you and i differ a

782
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:09,918
little bit i push i push potassium a

783
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:10,720
little bit higher than a lot of growers

784
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:11,759
do

785
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:15,839
and

786
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:20,640
the reason um is i i feel like you get a

787
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:22,158
a a payoff at harvest for sure so i'm

788
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,159
on board with that 100

789
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:26,480
yeah i think a lot of this the pk

790
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:28,080
boosters in uh

791
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,000
that are marketed in the canvas industry

792
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:31,678
it's really the k that's the driver

793
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,558
there more than the p in terms of

794
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:37,600
finishing flowers um so i would agree

795
00:29:34,558 --> 00:29:40,398
with you there um so yeah calcium and

796
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:43,519
potassium i think are the the real

797
00:29:40,398 --> 00:29:45,678
secret to to strong flower production

798
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:47,278
and i think that um

799
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:48,080
phosphorus well we could get into the

800
00:29:47,278 --> 00:29:49,839
hole

801
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:52,000
we could get into that whole uh rabbit

802
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:54,158
hole some other time but but yeah i

803
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:58,319
totally agree so as i'm i'm following

804
00:29:54,159 --> 00:30:00,399
along here on your uh on the blog post

805
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:01,678
uh and folks can do that as well i'll

806
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:04,639
talk about this

807
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:06,798
at the beginning of the podcast but um

808
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:09,600
what about for a canopy where you've

809
00:30:06,798 --> 00:30:11,519
removed a lot of your lower leaves

810
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:14,398
because i'm thinking you know you've

811
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:17,200
trellised your plant um what do you use

812
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:19,278
for clues when you don't have as many

813
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,000
you don't have that lower canopy as you

814
00:30:19,278 --> 00:30:23,119
know

815
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,119
to look at is i guess as much

816
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:28,558
yeah so it's it's obviously a very

817
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:32,479
common practice to um you know

818
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:34,079
before flip before flowering

819
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,159
there's a bunch of different names for

820
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:38,639
it you know colloquially you know people

821
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:40,720
we call it lollipopping but basically

822
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,240
trim out the bottom of the plant

823
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,558
and so you're going to remove a lot of

824
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,558
your

825
00:30:45,038 --> 00:30:49,599
your lower leaves obviously and that's a

826
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:51,918
good practice you know it's going to

827
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:54,240
open up air flow and it's going to limit

828
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:56,799
the number of budding sites and so that

829
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,880
you can get a more marketable

830
00:30:56,798 --> 00:31:01,119
product and that sort of thing

831
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,120
but

832
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:06,319
my experience has always been that if

833
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:08,399
you have a nutrient deficiency

834
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:10,158
um

835
00:31:08,398 --> 00:31:11,678
the lower leaves

836
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:13,679
on your plant

837
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:15,200
regardless of where almost like i'm

838
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:16,720
thinking about it in terms of a perched

839
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,080
water table it doesn't really matter

840
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,880
where you move it it's just going to be

841
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:21,759
there

842
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:23,760
i see the the leaf symptoms happening in

843
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:25,919
those bottom most leaves

844
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:28,158
does that make sense yeah this coats i

845
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:30,320
was getting at so if you've removed

846
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:32,399
let's say the bottom

847
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:33,439
eight inches of the of the

848
00:31:32,398 --> 00:31:35,038
plant

849
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:37,038
and all those leaves then essentially

850
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:38,558
your nitrogen deficiency if it's showing

851
00:31:37,038 --> 00:31:39,839
up would start or your phosphorus one

852
00:31:38,558 --> 00:31:41,759
would start with whatever that bottom

853
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:43,918
leaf is even if it's

854
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:45,599
eight inches up um

855
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:47,840
wherever your canopy starts so yeah i

856
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:51,918
just kind of wanted to get that into the

857
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:54,480
podcast so yeah the the minimum canopy

858
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:57,519
i ever see is a 12 inch canopy you know

859
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:59,038
and that's still enough to give you um

860
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:01,359
lower leaf

861
00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:03,519
leaves that you could use for you know

862
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:07,119
visually

863
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:07,919
you know sleuthing out a symptom

864
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:09,119
now

865
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:10,320
uh

866
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:12,239
i want to let you keep going through

867
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:15,278
this but i see a lot of people

868
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,960
online talking about are having trouble

869
00:32:15,278 --> 00:32:18,720
distinguishing between calcium and

870
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:22,960
magnesium

871
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:25,600
in terms of leaf damage

872
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,679
could you maybe touch on a little bit on

873
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:29,199
how to distinguish the two oh and i

874
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:31,519
would add that you can also do a soil

875
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,720
drench with epsom salt um since you'd

876
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:34,880
mentioned the food right here you can

877
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,000
also do that as a salt drench but yeah

878
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,320
can you can you talk a little bit about

879
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,359
that which is great for flour yeah yeah

880
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:43,439
so um calcium and magnesium

881
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:45,359
um

882
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:48,159
calcium deficiencies

883
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:48,158
um

884
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:55,120
in in substrate growing is is is

885
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:56,480
something that i see a lot and

886
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:58,239
there's a lot of different ways that you

887
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,519
can have a calcium deficiency like i

888
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,919
mentioned earlier like you can have

889
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:03,120
plenty of calcium in your soil

890
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:05,038
um

891
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:06,879
but because it travels primarily in the

892
00:33:05,038 --> 00:33:08,879
xylem if your transpiration rates are

893
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:11,360
messed up you know high relative

894
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,559
humidity

895
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:14,240
something like that you won't get it

896
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:16,720
into the tissue

897
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,319
calcium and magnesium

898
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,159
differ in that magnesium is going to

899
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:22,079
show up on the bottom of the plant

900
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:23,519
versus calcium on the top of the plant

901
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:25,918
so that's one of the

902
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:28,880
the easiest ways

903
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:30,640
magnesium is famous for that interval

904
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,240
chlorosis

905
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,278
the tiger striping but again at the

906
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,038
bottom

907
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:38,079
so you can get some of that interval

908
00:33:35,038 --> 00:33:39,679
chlorosis uh with with calcium but it

909
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:42,798
would be up at the top

910
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:44,399
of the plant and where i see calcium

911
00:33:42,798 --> 00:33:48,158
issues

912
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:51,278
on plants i see uh necrosis

913
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:54,159
and distortion i see uh you know calcium

914
00:33:51,278 --> 00:33:56,079
is responsible for the structure

915
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:58,320
and so if you don't have it like you

916
00:33:56,079 --> 00:34:00,720
know in tomatoes blossom end rot or

917
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:03,119
apples you get apple scab and what that

918
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:06,399
is is just a a lack of calcium and so

919
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:07,359
you've got a weak cell structure um you

920
00:34:06,398 --> 00:34:09,598
know so

921
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:11,598
anybody who's grown like a

922
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:13,679
a cultivar that you they're used to and

923
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:15,519
then the next the next round

924
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:18,159
if they're low on calcium they'll get

925
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:20,960
almost like this vinyl growth it'll get

926
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:22,480
really long and it can't support itself

927
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,480
and then come flower

928
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,918
you've got lower flower

929
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:28,398
and the

930
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:29,759
even though that it's lowered flour it

931
00:34:28,398 --> 00:34:31,199
they can't support the weight of

932
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,079
themselves they're just kind of falling

933
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:34,078
all over the place

934
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:41,439
and i'm referencing also between sort of

935
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:43,039
our

936
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:45,200
dichotomous key the one that you put

937
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:48,398
together and we're offering also in

938
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:50,078
conjunction with paul coxen's paper

939
00:34:48,398 --> 00:34:51,759
i've had paul on the podcast people

940
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:53,760
should definitely check that out it's

941
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:56,800
called characterization of nutrient

942
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:58,240
disorders of cannabis sativa and

943
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,920
you know from looking at his photos it

944
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:01,118
also appears that

945
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:04,240
calcium

946
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:06,960
starts more at the base of the leaf

947
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:09,439
whereas magnesium you get a more of a

948
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:11,519
interventile corrosive across the entire

949
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,760
leaf

950
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:15,599
based on heat yeah that's another tail

951
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:18,320
yeah that's another telltale sign that

952
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:19,359
you can use is you know where exactly

953
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,440
did that

954
00:35:19,358 --> 00:35:23,440
you know chlorosis start if you've got

955
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,720
it more on the tip

956
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,480
um

957
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:30,000
or on the little

958
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:32,639
serrations along the margin up top

959
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,440
immediately i'm going to start thinking

960
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:38,639
calcium but if i've got like

961
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:41,358
if i've got tan speckling

962
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:43,358
larger areas

963
00:35:41,358 --> 00:35:45,279
i might be dealing with

964
00:35:43,358 --> 00:35:47,199
manganese up top

965
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:50,079
you know and then calcium is kind of

966
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:52,799
famous for that wind burned look

967
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:55,440
where the the edges are going to go

968
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,560
necrotic on you as well

969
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,039
iron

970
00:35:56,559 --> 00:36:00,799
one of its telltale signs is you know

971
00:35:59,039 --> 00:36:02,000
iron you can kind of see sometimes

972
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,240
throughout the entire plant but

973
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,119
typically it starts up top

974
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:06,959
and

975
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:09,039
i think everybody's seen it and maybe

976
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:11,519
just not even recognized what it is but

977
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:13,279
when somebody contacts me about young

978
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:14,719
plants especially

979
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,720
and they're like you know my plants look

980
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:18,480
really healthy but they're they're

981
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:21,358
always the new growth is always like

982
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:24,079
really light towards the petiole end of

983
00:36:21,358 --> 00:36:26,799
the leaf and that's iron usually so you

984
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:29,200
know knowing where it starts on the

985
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,000
plant but then also on the leaf can help

986
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:31,439
you

987
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,960
dial in

988
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,960
what nutrients you're dealing with

989
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:38,960
can iron look like light bleaching

990
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:44,480
iron can iron can actually go you know

991
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:46,240
that's one of the the symptoms of iron

992
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,599
and especially in

993
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:49,759
um

994
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:50,800
some row crops like grapes and things

995
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,520
like that

996
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:55,599
if you have an iron issue it can go all

997
00:36:53,519 --> 00:36:58,800
the way to white you know so it'll start

998
00:36:55,599 --> 00:37:00,800
off as chlorotic looking you know pale

999
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,720
lime green and then it goes chlorotic

1000
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,880
turns yellow but then if you've got a

1001
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:07,279
serious iron issue it can look like

1002
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:09,838
bleaching

1003
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:11,119
just because it the tips will go white

1004
00:37:09,838 --> 00:37:13,279
um

1005
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:14,559
you know whole leaves will go white that

1006
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:17,440
you you would have to have a pretty

1007
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:18,719
severe iron deficiency but i see it i

1008
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,480
definitely see it you know iron's

1009
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:22,959
another one that's hard to

1010
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:24,719
you know without chelators and you know

1011
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:27,358
that sort of thing you know without

1012
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:30,639
humix and vulvix and you can have iron

1013
00:37:27,358 --> 00:37:32,400
issues especially at low ph

1014
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:35,039
you know

1015
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:37,039
so so when diagnosing a plant

1016
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:38,639
um what what you're saying essentially

1017
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:40,880
is it's really important to not only

1018
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:44,078
have a photo

1019
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:46,160
or or take a close look at a leaf

1020
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:48,160
itself but also

1021
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:50,239
look at where that leaf is located on

1022
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:52,239
the plant and also have a photo of the

1023
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:55,439
entire plant so like

1024
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:57,598
there's no way a person could really

1025
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:00,079
i would say effectively diagnose a plant

1026
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:02,240
off of just one photo of a leaf

1027
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:04,240
on a forum for example

1028
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:05,679
because i see people post a picture of a

1029
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:07,919
leaf all the time and then you know

1030
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:08,719
everyone writes cowmeg or whatever you

1031
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,320
know

1032
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:13,519
they think they think it might be it

1033
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:15,119
happens all the time yeah but um

1034
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:18,480
this idea then is we really need to see

1035
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:20,079
the entire plant and then also know um

1036
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,760
where on that leaf or where on that

1037
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:24,800
plant that plant was in the the leaf was

1038
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:26,800
located to really start dialing in what

1039
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,400
the limiting factor is what the nutrient

1040
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,480
deficiency is

1041
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,559
exactly the the first thing i asked

1042
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,838
somebody you know when somebody contacts

1043
00:38:32,559 --> 00:38:36,719
me and says

1044
00:38:33,838 --> 00:38:39,440
i've got a plant and it has an issue the

1045
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:41,118
first thing i do is i send them a little

1046
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:44,079
questionnaire about

1047
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:45,920
limiting factors you know what is your

1048
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:48,640
your lighting what is your temperature

1049
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:50,240
what is your water and i ask a bunch of

1050
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:51,838
questions they're usually not expecting

1051
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:54,078
to get questions back to their question

1052
00:38:51,838 --> 00:38:55,119
but it really helps us dial it in

1053
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:57,280
and then

1054
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:59,920
i want photos and i want photos of the

1055
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:02,960
entire plant you know if it's on if it's

1056
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:05,838
a on scale canopy i'd like to see photos

1057
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:07,679
of the canopy so i can look for patterns

1058
00:39:05,838 --> 00:39:10,000
and you know it's really difficult to

1059
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:12,799
discern this stuff in person so

1060
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,838
discerning it you know from photos like

1061
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:18,560
suzanne you know if you send her a a

1062
00:39:15,838 --> 00:39:19,759
grainy photo of what might be an aphid

1063
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:21,279
and ask

1064
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,720
ask for help

1065
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:25,440
um

1066
00:39:22,719 --> 00:39:26,799
you're not gonna get um you're gonna get

1067
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,559
scolded

1068
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:31,359
yeah you're gonna get your well you're

1069
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:35,440
gonna learn something and um and that's

1070
00:39:31,358 --> 00:39:37,199
to to take really good precise images

1071
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:39,358
because that's that's how you empower

1072
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:40,719
that person to help you and so if

1073
00:39:39,358 --> 00:39:43,440
somebody can

1074
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:45,199
you know note first and foremost where

1075
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:48,159
on the planet started

1076
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:49,838
and then you know within that

1077
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:52,000
issue you know did it start at the

1078
00:39:49,838 --> 00:39:52,880
petiol you know closest to the stem or

1079
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,400
did it

1080
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:56,480
start on the tip

1081
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,240
um you know

1082
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,800
those are really important to help us

1083
00:39:58,239 --> 00:40:03,279
guide what the issue is because we're

1084
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:05,599
we're trying to determine what the issue

1085
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,519
is without being able to scope without

1086
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:09,519
being able to have tissue without being

1087
00:40:07,519 --> 00:40:11,039
able to have soil reports and you know

1088
00:40:09,519 --> 00:40:13,759
we really want to do the best we can for

1089
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:14,960
folks and then set them up for success

1090
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,280
so

1091
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:19,599
it really it really comes down to the

1092
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:21,200
more information they can give us the

1093
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:23,280
better job

1094
00:40:21,199 --> 00:40:24,799
we can do figuring out what their issue

1095
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:27,359
is

1096
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:30,240
and one of the keys i would say or clues

1097
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:32,400
is if you have a soil report that shows

1098
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:35,039
that you have sufficiency of nutrients

1099
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,880
in that soil you've used good inputs to

1100
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:39,279
know that you have good biology in there

1101
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,640
that's going to cycle the nutrients then

1102
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,160
and your plant still doesn't look the

1103
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:43,199
way you want it to well then at that

1104
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:45,039
point

1105
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:48,639
for me it's usually pretty clear that

1106
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:49,920
it's probably a watering issue

1107
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:51,920
one of the things that don marshall

1108
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:54,720
talked about in his podcast that i like

1109
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:57,039
to remind folks of is that

1110
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:59,358
what like just how important watering is

1111
00:40:57,039 --> 00:41:00,880
and when you over or under water you're

1112
00:40:59,358 --> 00:41:02,239
having the same effect in the plant in

1113
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,240
that you're killing root hairs and when

1114
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:07,118
you kill root hairs the plant does not

1115
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:09,199
have the ability to uptake nutrients

1116
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:11,680
to the same effect that it would have

1117
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:13,759
prior to that to the root hair death so

1118
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:16,399
it can display deficiencies even if

1119
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,760
there is sufficient nutrients in the

1120
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,200
soil so

1121
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,119
um

1122
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:22,719
that that's one of the first places i

1123
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:25,119
like to start when they're talking about

1124
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:27,039
deficiencies is make sure that the

1125
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:29,519
watering is is correct and you're not

1126
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:31,119
massively over under watering

1127
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:32,800
because you can apply all the nutrients

1128
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:34,240
in the world from an organic perspective

1129
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,839
and they just won't be available to the

1130
00:41:34,239 --> 00:41:38,559
plant until

1131
00:41:35,838 --> 00:41:40,880
we correct the watering

1132
00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:43,279
yeah that that's there's an old

1133
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,960
greenhouse adage that the most important

1134
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:47,440
person in the greenhouse is the person

1135
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:49,599
holding the hose and i i agree with that

1136
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:51,119
a hundred percent um

1137
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:52,960
that's the first you know when i would

1138
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:56,079
bring somebody on

1139
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:58,159
and and start working them into you know

1140
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:00,240
a workflow that's the first thing i

1141
00:41:58,159 --> 00:42:02,879
would do with them and a lot of people

1142
00:42:00,239 --> 00:42:05,118
would you know kind of feel

1143
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:07,519
insulted you know i would i would give

1144
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:08,960
them a water hose and uh

1145
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:10,719
with a dram

1146
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,960
breaker you know water breaker head on

1147
00:42:10,719 --> 00:42:14,399
it and explain the importance of that

1148
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,880
you know you get good flow and you're

1149
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:19,358
not compacting the soil and

1150
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:21,119
blasting spores up into the air and that

1151
00:42:19,358 --> 00:42:22,639
kind of stuff but then

1152
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:25,358
they would expect me to just cut them

1153
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:27,199
loose and i would spend weeks

1154
00:42:25,358 --> 00:42:29,039
standing there with them watching them

1155
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:31,039
water you know

1156
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:34,480
enormous canopies

1157
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:37,199
and it's because it is the single most

1158
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:39,358
important thing and i don't care what

1159
00:42:37,199 --> 00:42:41,679
style of cultivation

1160
00:42:39,358 --> 00:42:44,318
what form of nutrients you're applying

1161
00:42:41,679 --> 00:42:45,919
if you are not watering appropriately

1162
00:42:44,318 --> 00:42:47,838
you are

1163
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:49,920
definitely going to have issues

1164
00:42:47,838 --> 00:42:52,559
that's the number one

1165
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:55,119
the number one

1166
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:56,880
reason for lost crops in greenhouse

1167
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:59,200
growing is is

1168
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:02,079
irrigation issues

1169
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:03,598
and uh not pests not pathogens uh it's

1170
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:06,240
operator error

1171
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:08,559
and uh yeah so getting your water dialed

1172
00:43:06,239 --> 00:43:10,399
in and really knowing your

1173
00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:11,679
your your water and in the same way that

1174
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,519
you're saying

1175
00:43:11,679 --> 00:43:15,838
take you know if you have if you've

1176
00:43:13,519 --> 00:43:19,199
armed yourself with a soil report

1177
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:20,480
and you and you notice a nutrient issue

1178
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:22,719
that's something that becomes

1179
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,760
experienced and you know that and so if

1180
00:43:22,719 --> 00:43:26,000
you are

1181
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:28,000
monitoring your water you know and most

1182
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,318
organic growers are growing in larger

1183
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,239
smart pots or raised beds so they have a

1184
00:43:30,318 --> 00:43:34,079
bigger ecosystem that can keep up with

1185
00:43:32,239 --> 00:43:36,239
the plant's needs

1186
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:38,720
it's pretty easy to put a you know like

1187
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:40,318
a blue mat water sensor or

1188
00:43:38,719 --> 00:43:42,000
you know or you know i

1189
00:43:40,318 --> 00:43:44,079
shouldn't shouldn't say brands but just

1190
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,639
you know if you have a water meter that

1191
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:48,000
you can you know uh with a ceramic tip

1192
00:43:46,639 --> 00:43:50,400
with that you know it's going to measure

1193
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,318
that osmotic pressure and

1194
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:55,920
you you'll be able to dial in you know

1195
00:43:52,318 --> 00:43:58,480
at this at this millibar metric my

1196
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,920
plants are absolutely in heaven you know

1197
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:02,000
and if i go this direction they don't

1198
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:04,720
like it and so

1199
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:07,358
data you know it's all about data and

1200
00:44:04,719 --> 00:44:10,799
and being able to associate those visual

1201
00:44:07,358 --> 00:44:13,119
clues back to that data

1202
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,560
so what are some ways to like you

1203
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:17,280
mentioned with

1204
00:44:14,559 --> 00:44:19,199
magnesium for example epsom salts an

1205
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,880
easy way to see a visual

1206
00:44:19,199 --> 00:44:22,159
change

1207
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,400
let's talk about a little bit about that

1208
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:26,639
process so let's say we know that we are

1209
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:29,680
low in a particular

1210
00:44:26,639 --> 00:44:30,879
mineral how do we go about

1211
00:44:29,679 --> 00:44:33,118
you know once we once we've done the

1212
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:35,200
diagnosis we know we're not

1213
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:37,519
uh you know causing a big issue with our

1214
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:40,239
irrigation practices how do we go about

1215
00:44:37,519 --> 00:44:41,920
correcting a nutrient issue or mineral

1216
00:44:40,239 --> 00:44:43,358
issue

1217
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,639
so

1218
00:44:43,358 --> 00:44:45,920
there's a there's a couple of different

1219
00:44:44,639 --> 00:44:46,960
ways you can go there's a bunch of

1220
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:49,440
different ways you can go about it

1221
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,559
obviously

1222
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,480
but

1223
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:55,279
first and foremost you just said you

1224
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:57,679
you've diagnosed an issue and so in you

1225
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:59,359
know what's what's the important

1226
00:44:57,679 --> 00:45:00,960
thing that you do in all

1227
00:44:59,358 --> 00:45:02,239
scientific experiments you have a

1228
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:05,440
control

1229
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:06,559
and so if you want to verify for

1230
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:08,000
yourself

1231
00:45:06,559 --> 00:45:09,759
that you

1232
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,000
have figured out what the issue is and

1233
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:14,480
that you can correct it

1234
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:17,280
you know you want to add that nutrient

1235
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:19,838
that element and so you know

1236
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:21,519
when it's dealing with

1237
00:45:19,838 --> 00:45:23,119
trace elements

1238
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:26,880
um

1239
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:28,079
sometimes it's better just to add a

1240
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,318
kind of

1241
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:32,880
one and done

1242
00:45:30,318 --> 00:45:35,039
amendment you know something that like

1243
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:36,720
glacial uh rock dust or something that's

1244
00:45:35,039 --> 00:45:37,759
gonna or kelp that's got a bunch of

1245
00:45:36,719 --> 00:45:38,719
trace

1246
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:41,440
uh

1247
00:45:38,719 --> 00:45:43,919
minerals in it as opposed to

1248
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:45,838
trying to put that one trace element

1249
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:48,079
back in there because that's that's

1250
00:45:45,838 --> 00:45:50,559
really touchy and a lot of times you can

1251
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:54,240
do more damage trying to add an

1252
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:56,400
individual trace element back in so i i

1253
00:45:54,239 --> 00:45:59,759
don't go that route with with the trace

1254
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:01,838
elements but with my micros and macros

1255
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:05,760
you know it's really easy to get

1256
00:46:01,838 --> 00:46:08,159
um you know a sulfate of just about

1257
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:11,200
anything and you can you you know you

1258
00:46:08,159 --> 00:46:13,118
can add that back in and then for your

1259
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:15,838
your your nitrogen your phosphorus your

1260
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:15,838
potassium

1261
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:21,358
i would add you know a specific

1262
00:46:18,719 --> 00:46:24,078
amendment usually something at you know

1263
00:46:21,358 --> 00:46:26,960
fine particle size with a lot of surface

1264
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:28,960
area that's more soluble

1265
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:30,960
you know if you're suspecting

1266
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:34,400
something like phosphorous make sure

1267
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:36,559
you've got phosphorus solubilizing uh

1268
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:38,880
bacteria in your

1269
00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:40,400
in your beds in your pots

1270
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:42,079
you know like you're saying you know you

1271
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:43,760
want to make sure that it's whatever it

1272
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:47,599
is is available

1273
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:49,440
um and that that requires uh

1274
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:50,720
you know your microbes and your soil to

1275
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,240
get to work

1276
00:46:50,719 --> 00:46:54,159
um

1277
00:46:52,239 --> 00:46:55,759
so that that would be the approach would

1278
00:46:54,159 --> 00:46:57,679
be to you know once once you've

1279
00:46:55,760 --> 00:47:00,000
determined whatever element it is you

1280
00:46:57,679 --> 00:47:02,159
want to add that particular element and

1281
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,760
then wait for a response and some are

1282
00:47:02,159 --> 00:47:05,440
faster than others

1283
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:08,319
you know like that magnesium response is

1284
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:10,480
really fast um uh phosphorus or

1285
00:47:08,318 --> 00:47:12,400
potassium is a little slower reaction

1286
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:14,559
usually um

1287
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:16,559
you know calcium usually responds pretty

1288
00:47:14,559 --> 00:47:18,639
pretty quickly um

1289
00:47:16,559 --> 00:47:21,599
to uh to a foliar

1290
00:47:18,639 --> 00:47:22,639
in veg and then you know egg lime as

1291
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:24,880
opposed to

1292
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:26,879
you know something slow releasing

1293
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:29,680
and um

1294
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:32,318
so that's that's the approach

1295
00:47:29,679 --> 00:47:33,759
is that yeah so um just to give some

1296
00:47:32,318 --> 00:47:36,159
people some suggestions like with

1297
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:37,040
calcium you mentioned egg lime which is

1298
00:47:36,159 --> 00:47:39,358
uh

1299
00:47:37,039 --> 00:47:42,639
very soluble works great it can raise

1300
00:47:39,358 --> 00:47:43,598
your ph um we'll add carbonates so you

1301
00:47:42,639 --> 00:47:44,799
have to

1302
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:46,960
kind of think about a lot of different

1303
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:49,119
things when deciding what to add

1304
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:51,599
gypsum there's some water-soluble gypsum

1305
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:52,720
calcium sulfate

1306
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:54,480
that

1307
00:47:52,719 --> 00:47:55,919
it works really well in a lot of cases

1308
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:57,838
too

1309
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:00,000
when i think of potassium if i need it

1310
00:47:57,838 --> 00:48:02,239
latent flour and i need it quickly

1311
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:05,119
there's some really good potassium

1312
00:48:02,239 --> 00:48:06,078
sulfate options 0 0 50

1313
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:08,000
so it's going to give you a lot of

1314
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:10,318
potassium

1315
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,400
and you can water that in

1316
00:48:10,318 --> 00:48:14,719
you know really easily to a flowering

1317
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,720
crop

1318
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:18,800
i think nitrogen and phosphorus are a

1319
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:20,400
little more complicated from an organic

1320
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:22,079
perspective but there's some options

1321
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:24,240
there too

1322
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:26,640
phosphorus is the hardest to manage i

1323
00:48:24,239 --> 00:48:28,479
feel like well it's phosphorus you know

1324
00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:31,039
and this is this is where some people

1325
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:33,358
may have issue but fish hydrolysate is

1326
00:48:31,039 --> 00:48:36,719
stabilized with phosphoric acid which is

1327
00:48:33,358 --> 00:48:39,119
a very available form of phosphorus

1328
00:48:36,719 --> 00:48:40,399
interestingly enough we just saw a soil

1329
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:41,280
test where

1330
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,680
the

1331
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:46,000
grower had been using phosphoric acid in

1332
00:48:43,679 --> 00:48:49,039
their greenhouse to lower the ph of

1333
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:51,280
their water and we saw off the charts

1334
00:48:49,039 --> 00:48:53,039
available phosphorus like numbers that i

1335
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:54,240
hadn't seen

1336
00:48:53,039 --> 00:48:55,519
before

1337
00:48:54,239 --> 00:48:58,239
and the grower had just switched from

1338
00:48:55,519 --> 00:48:59,759
using sulfuric acid so

1339
00:48:58,239 --> 00:49:01,759
that was very

1340
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:04,240
obvious on the soil test and i thought

1341
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:05,680
that was really interesting

1342
00:49:04,239 --> 00:49:07,118
so that's a very available source of

1343
00:49:05,679 --> 00:49:09,679
phosphorus too

1344
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:10,960
depending on

1345
00:49:09,679 --> 00:49:13,039
you know what you're comfortable using

1346
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:15,519
and if it makes sense in your grow

1347
00:49:13,039 --> 00:49:17,920
but just knowing i think i think being

1348
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:20,639
educated as a grower as to how available

1349
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:23,358
these nutrients are

1350
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:24,480
is also an important part of of this

1351
00:49:23,358 --> 00:49:26,960
whole

1352
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:28,559
dichotomous key process for you know

1353
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:29,679
correcting any issue you may have

1354
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:31,920
because

1355
00:49:29,679 --> 00:49:34,879
like you mentioned if i have an issue

1356
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:36,720
with calcium and i'm you know midway

1357
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:38,800
through flour and i put out granulated

1358
00:49:36,719 --> 00:49:41,598
gypsum and water that in well i may not

1359
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:43,760
be getting a noticeable effect in

1360
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:46,160
raising calcium for the plant

1361
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:48,000
in a timely fashion so that that's

1362
00:49:46,159 --> 00:49:49,920
definitely important

1363
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,679
yeah i think that um

1364
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:54,000
folks have to make those decisions like

1365
00:49:51,679 --> 00:49:55,519
with the phosphorus work around you know

1366
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,960
it's really important that people know

1367
00:49:55,519 --> 00:49:59,358
that that's an option and you can

1368
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:01,760
maintain a you know an uh omri

1369
00:49:59,358 --> 00:50:04,078
certification if if you do that because

1370
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:05,920
it it has to be in there to stabilize

1371
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:07,920
the fish you know so

1372
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:10,159
there are there are we work arounds on

1373
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:12,318
certain things and it really just comes

1374
00:50:10,159 --> 00:50:14,480
down to

1375
00:50:12,318 --> 00:50:16,960
what you're comfortable with and your

1376
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:18,960
goals as far as you know how close you

1377
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:21,358
can move to sustainability you know that

1378
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:24,400
i think that's the ultimate goal

1379
00:50:21,358 --> 00:50:27,279
i would like to put in a note right here

1380
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:29,280
on those same lines you know you're

1381
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:32,000
saying what should i add

1382
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:33,200
uh the worst thing that somebody can add

1383
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,079
is

1384
00:50:33,199 --> 00:50:35,679
um

1385
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:37,280
shotgun approach where they start

1386
00:50:35,679 --> 00:50:38,558
throwing a bunch of different things at

1387
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:40,720
it and

1388
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:43,680
the absolute worst thing they could do

1389
00:50:40,719 --> 00:50:45,679
is use an unknown product the the

1390
00:50:43,679 --> 00:50:47,759
product i see

1391
00:50:45,679 --> 00:50:50,399
people using the most

1392
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:52,160
and causing the most problems is very

1393
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:55,760
well intentioned but i see a lot of

1394
00:50:52,159 --> 00:50:58,000
folks that top dress with local compost

1395
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:59,440
and by local compost i mean

1396
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,000
compost that

1397
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:04,159
they produced or a friend produced

1398
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,760
something that has not been tested for

1399
00:51:04,159 --> 00:51:07,838
its nutrients

1400
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:10,000
hasn't been tested for pets

1401
00:51:07,838 --> 00:51:13,119
tests and pathogens something that

1402
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,719
hasn't been tested for um

1403
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:17,358
you know

1404
00:51:14,719 --> 00:51:19,679
seed and weed it's just it's just some

1405
00:51:17,358 --> 00:51:21,279
compost that somebody made and it looks

1406
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:22,480
good it's brown and it looks good it

1407
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:25,040
smells good

1408
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:28,000
but it could have heavy metals it could

1409
00:51:25,039 --> 00:51:29,519
have incredibly high sodium levels it

1410
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,239
could have you know

1411
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:34,318
there's all kinds of issues and so

1412
00:51:32,239 --> 00:51:38,239
one thing that i really encourage people

1413
00:51:34,318 --> 00:51:40,480
to do is you know if if you see an issue

1414
00:51:38,239 --> 00:51:42,399
you can you can contact me

1415
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:45,119
you can contact me and i'm not going to

1416
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:46,880
charge you anything i'm just i love

1417
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:48,318
plants i'm super curious we want

1418
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:51,838
everybody to be

1419
00:51:48,318 --> 00:51:51,838
as well armed and

1420
00:51:52,159 --> 00:51:54,960
as empowered in their garden as they can

1421
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:57,760
be

1422
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:59,358
and so if somebody can contact me and

1423
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:02,480
say hey i've got this issue i'm thinking

1424
00:51:59,358 --> 00:52:05,279
about adding this we can tell them

1425
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:06,000
oh that's a great idea or i could tell

1426
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,680
them

1427
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,639
you know you might want to look at this

1428
00:52:07,679 --> 00:52:10,239
option

1429
00:52:08,639 --> 00:52:12,639
might work a little bit better for you

1430
00:52:10,239 --> 00:52:14,719
this could cause an antagonism so you

1431
00:52:12,639 --> 00:52:16,879
know you could throw you know you could

1432
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:20,159
start with one problem and create a lot

1433
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:22,318
more problems by using unknown products

1434
00:52:20,159 --> 00:52:24,239
so um

1435
00:52:22,318 --> 00:52:26,239
yeah and i want to add

1436
00:52:24,239 --> 00:52:28,159
you know a phosphoric acid is not the

1437
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:29,919
only way to raise

1438
00:52:28,159 --> 00:52:32,159
p um

1439
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:33,280
i don't like guanos but they work too

1440
00:52:32,159 --> 00:52:35,598
but one of the things that we've had

1441
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:37,280
good success with is uh

1442
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:39,039
and you know we talked about not naming

1443
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:40,960
brands but mammoth p

1444
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:43,039
and having something like you mentioned

1445
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:44,240
that piece solubilizing

1446
00:52:43,039 --> 00:52:46,800
microbes

1447
00:52:44,239 --> 00:52:49,279
is is a good way to make that pea more

1448
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:50,960
available to the plant so um

1449
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:54,400
that's definitely a good option if you

1450
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:55,599
wanted to stay fully organic um

1451
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:57,200
is another consideration and i didn't

1452
00:52:55,599 --> 00:52:59,680
want to make it sound like i don't want

1453
00:52:57,199 --> 00:53:01,439
to make it sound like um

1454
00:52:59,679 --> 00:53:04,399
it's hard to get it's not hard to get

1455
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:06,480
phosphorus into the soil it's harder to

1456
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:08,559
get it available to plants that's where

1457
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:10,000
it's tricky and using something like the

1458
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:12,000
mammoth p

1459
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,239
eliminates that issue it'll it'll keep

1460
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,000
it insufficiency for you throughout the

1461
00:53:14,239 --> 00:53:16,959
full term of your plan

1462
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,838
yeah and then the other thing i just

1463
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:21,679
want to touch on is as a soil producer

1464
00:53:19,838 --> 00:53:23,119
ourselves

1465
00:53:21,679 --> 00:53:25,118
you know from time to time we do see

1466
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:27,280
people that are having

1467
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:29,760
issues and

1468
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:31,519
what i like to do is is go through this

1469
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:33,440
process that the one we just talked

1470
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:34,960
about with the grower

1471
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:36,400
but there's things that we know about

1472
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:39,599
our soil because we've

1473
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:42,880
we've seen so many soil tests of our of

1474
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:44,318
our soil i know that as a grower in a

1475
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:46,160
small container the first things that

1476
00:53:44,318 --> 00:53:48,159
you're going to run out of is nitrogen

1477
00:53:46,159 --> 00:53:49,838
and potassium i just

1478
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:52,480
i just know that and that's all it makes

1479
00:53:49,838 --> 00:53:54,799
sense too because this is more mobile we

1480
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:56,639
tend to be sufficient in phosphorus and

1481
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:59,839
calcium

1482
00:53:56,639 --> 00:54:01,118
even in a slightly smaller container now

1483
00:53:59,838 --> 00:54:02,719
one of the things you mentioned is that

1484
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:04,960
the larger container just offers more

1485
00:54:02,719 --> 00:54:06,879
buffering capacity we can only fit so

1486
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:08,318
much nutrients into a given volume of

1487
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:09,680
soil and that corrects a lot of the

1488
00:54:08,318 --> 00:54:11,119
issues

1489
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:13,440
right there just going into a larger

1490
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:16,640
volume or larger container

1491
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:20,400
but contacting your soil provider

1492
00:54:16,639 --> 00:54:22,000
is a good resource for you too because

1493
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:23,280
like i said brandon

1494
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,199
and myself and

1495
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:26,880
and then we'll work with a grower to

1496
00:54:25,199 --> 00:54:27,679
sort of figure out what

1497
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:29,119
um

1498
00:54:27,679 --> 00:54:30,078
what's going on

1499
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:32,640
and

1500
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:35,760
um you know any soil provider should be

1501
00:54:32,639 --> 00:54:37,358
able to offer you that same service so

1502
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:39,440
you know i don't know what some of these

1503
00:54:37,358 --> 00:54:42,798
other commercial soils may be high or

1504
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:44,798
low in relative to say our soil but i

1505
00:54:42,798 --> 00:54:46,559
know pretty well how our soil will

1506
00:54:44,798 --> 00:54:49,119
perform in a variety of different

1507
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:49,119
conditions

1508
00:54:49,199 --> 00:54:52,798
just because of all the tests i've seen

1509
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:54,639
and we've been doing this for so long so

1510
00:54:52,798 --> 00:54:56,239
i just want to suggest that to folks as

1511
00:54:54,639 --> 00:54:57,519
a resource that they should absolutely

1512
00:54:56,239 --> 00:54:59,598
be utilizing

1513
00:54:57,519 --> 00:55:01,440
and you know every every company should

1514
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:03,280
provide you with a soil test heavy

1515
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:05,119
metals you know organic certification

1516
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:06,480
whatever sort of information you need to

1517
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:08,000
make the right decision

1518
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:09,760
about your garden

1519
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,760
is just part of

1520
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:13,359
part of offering soil in my opinion

1521
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:15,520
commercially so

1522
00:55:13,358 --> 00:55:17,119
i just want to throw that out there

1523
00:55:15,519 --> 00:55:19,519
anything anything else you want to add

1524
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:19,519
brandon

1525
00:55:19,679 --> 00:55:24,558
no i just uh

1526
00:55:21,358 --> 00:55:26,159
i love what you just said and um about

1527
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:29,040
what you know

1528
00:55:26,159 --> 00:55:32,558
we're here to help and and help people

1529
00:55:29,039 --> 00:55:34,558
move towards sustainability and um

1530
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:36,960
you know if if you

1531
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:38,798
need a resource you know like you said

1532
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:40,000
with the soil reports

1533
00:55:38,798 --> 00:55:42,639
um

1534
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,679
we've seen so many of them

1535
00:55:42,639 --> 00:55:46,078
and

1536
00:55:43,679 --> 00:55:47,679
under you know so if somebody says they

1537
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:49,039
think that they're seeing a magnesium

1538
00:55:47,679 --> 00:55:51,358
deficiency

1539
00:55:49,039 --> 00:55:53,119
and i know that they're running

1540
00:55:51,358 --> 00:55:55,838
leds

1541
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:58,079
then i've seen you know certain number

1542
00:55:55,838 --> 00:56:02,558
of soil reports where

1543
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:05,200
magnesium is low in flower

1544
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:07,119
with certain brands of leds even and so

1545
00:56:05,199 --> 00:56:08,558
there's there's just there's so many

1546
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:11,760
correlations

1547
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:14,000
and and relationships to environment and

1548
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:16,960
nutrient uptake and

1549
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:19,519
you know with you know what close to 90

1550
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:20,400
years of prohibition

1551
00:56:19,519 --> 00:56:23,440
we're

1552
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:25,119
we're now able to to gather data we we

1553
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:27,119
can write things down you know that's

1554
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:29,200
the the old joke in the lab is the

1555
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:31,440
difference between science and screwing

1556
00:56:29,199 --> 00:56:34,480
around is writing it down on a piece of

1557
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:36,079
paper but we can do that now and so

1558
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:38,000
you know um

1559
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:39,359
take advantage take advantage of people

1560
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,880
who've been doing this ask them

1561
00:56:39,358 --> 00:56:43,598
questions you know make sure you're

1562
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:46,400
getting qualified answers don't um i'm

1563
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:49,920
not knocking forums forms are

1564
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:51,440
a great way to exchange information and

1565
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:53,280
um

1566
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:55,358
pick other people's brains and two heads

1567
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:58,240
are always better than one but you know

1568
00:56:55,358 --> 00:57:01,358
just make sure that both those heads um

1569
00:56:58,239 --> 00:57:03,919
are grounded in

1570
00:57:01,358 --> 00:57:06,400
standard scientific practices and

1571
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:08,480
you know can can give you

1572
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:10,318
action steps based on data

1573
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:12,000
you know as opposed to just a gut

1574
00:57:10,318 --> 00:57:14,400
instinct kind of thing because that's

1575
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,000
where you can get in trouble

1576
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:18,000
yeah well you go on a forum and you post

1577
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:20,559
a question and you'll get 30 different

1578
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:22,880
answers um and they'll all fight for the

1579
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:24,880
day they'll all be different i know

1580
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:26,318
and i guess you get what you pay for

1581
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:27,519
with forums and there's some you know

1582
00:57:26,318 --> 00:57:28,558
there's some forums i'm in that have

1583
00:57:27,519 --> 00:57:31,199
some very

1584
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:33,359
uh intelligent people i know suzanne for

1585
00:57:31,199 --> 00:57:34,879
example will answer bug questions on

1586
00:57:33,358 --> 00:57:35,759
occasion in some of the forums that i'm

1587
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:36,640
in and

1588
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:38,960
um

1589
00:57:36,639 --> 00:57:42,558
at that point you can take that as gold

1590
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:44,639
but rarely do i see that and

1591
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:46,160
so yeah i guess you get what you pay for

1592
00:57:44,639 --> 00:57:47,279
with forums

1593
00:57:46,159 --> 00:57:49,598
they can definitely give you a new

1594
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:52,000
perspective but uh you still at the end

1595
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:54,318
of the day are the one who is

1596
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:56,000
responsible and liable for your plants

1597
00:57:54,318 --> 00:57:57,599
and so you have to make the decisions

1598
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,440
based off of

1599
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:01,200
good information

1600
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:02,880
yeah and with that in mind since you're

1601
00:58:01,199 --> 00:58:05,279
the one responsible especially for

1602
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:08,160
on-scale growers you know if you have a

1603
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:10,480
stockholder that you have to answer to

1604
00:58:08,159 --> 00:58:13,759
don't ever apply a new product to your

1605
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:16,639
crop apply it uh you know to a test

1606
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:18,640
and if things go well then you can start

1607
00:58:16,639 --> 00:58:21,440
you know apply it to two plants you know

1608
00:58:18,639 --> 00:58:24,159
but don't don't ever jump

1609
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:26,400
with both feet into a new process or a

1610
00:58:24,159 --> 00:58:28,719
new product um

1611
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:31,440
just you know protect yourself and and

1612
00:58:28,719 --> 00:58:33,358
ease into it do a control make sure that

1613
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:35,519
you know what what limiting factors you

1614
00:58:33,358 --> 00:58:36,960
can lock in and

1615
00:58:35,519 --> 00:58:38,000
find that one that you're trying to

1616
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:40,559
adjust

1617
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:43,199
and and you know make an incremental

1618
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:45,040
change you know

1619
00:58:43,199 --> 00:58:47,118
you can always you can always go in at

1620
00:58:45,039 --> 00:58:48,400
half strength and see what happens you

1621
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:50,559
know

1622
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:53,519
you know especially with experiments

1623
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:54,960
so i think that's sound advice

1624
00:58:53,519 --> 00:58:56,639
all right well uh thanks for all your

1625
