podcast where we discuss the cutting

6
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,279
edge of growing from a science-based

7
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:30,719
perspective and drawing top experts from

8
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:32,000
around the industry to share their

9
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:33,439
wisdom and knowledge

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,679
i thought it would be good to do another

11
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:37,359
podcast from the growers perspective and

12
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:38,799

21
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,840
reached out in 2018 regarding consulting

22
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:59,919

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,280
we continue to learn

26
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,719

44
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,200
little bit about your sort of the the

45
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:45,920
methodologies and timeline of your

46
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,759
evolution as a grower um

47
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,200
going to a commercial scale here with

48
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,840
main craft cannabis can you kind of take

49
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,399
me through that a little bit

50
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,320
uh yeah sure so my wife and i started

51
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,920
the business in uh

52
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:59,758
in the commercial facility right in the

53
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,879
beginning of 2018

54
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,840
um

55
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:03,359
and

56
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,478
you know kind of from the beginning i

57
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:06,640
think we were

58
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:09,679
always wanting to be organic and we were

59
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,439
sort of in um you know smaller pots at

60
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,598
the time and

61
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:14,878
we were using cloth pots and

62
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:16,799
you know we ended up kind of like

63
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:18,959
leaning on bottle nutrients here and

64
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,120
there and you know if if we got the

65
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,400
organic amendments to run right it was

66
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,080
sort of a

67
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,480
threading the needle sort of operation

68
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,680
and you know we were having some issues

69
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:29,199
really getting the

70
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,719
quality we wanted

71
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:33,518
um and that's when i kind of came across

72
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:36,080
your podcast and reached out to you and

73
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:38,640
that kind of began the relationship and

74
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,879
you know you've really guided me towards

75
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:42,878
the larger soil volumes and all that

76
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:43,679
which i had my resistance to

77
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:44,878
um

78
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,560
you know and since then we've sort of

79
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:47,679
just gone down this journey and things

80
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,039
have really

81
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:53,040
started clicking pretty well

82
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:53,840
yeah can you elaborate a little bit on

83
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,079
that

84
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,920
process of sort of where you where you

85
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,239
started in the facility in terms of you

86
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:01,919
mean you were in these pots

87
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,000
can you talk about how you were growing

88
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:05,919
and then i you know i mean i can talk a

89
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,080
little about our conversations and where

90
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:08,878
that started but um

91
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,480
i'd love to hear it from your

92
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:13,199
perspective

93
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:13,919
for sure yeah um so we were just you

94
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:15,199
know

95
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:18,318
i think we first started we were just

96
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:20,079
you know mixing our own soil

97
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:22,799
and you know we weren't really getting

98
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,400
repeatable results at that point and

99
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,640
you know we ended up with a lot of like

100
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,719
week five problems basically we could

101
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:30,559
you know get through veg pretty well

102
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:32,878
and then by the time we got to flower a

103
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,199
lot of times we just had

104
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:37,199
deficiencies popping up and you know we

105
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:39,439
saw some of that in in veg once in a

106
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:40,560
while but it was a lot more manageable

107
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:41,519
um

108
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,400
and

109
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,400
you know

110
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,560
at the time so i was testing all sort of

111
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,039
you know different amendments and stuff

112
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,479
um and then with the mixing because

113
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:53,759
we're in maine so it's really hard to

114
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:55,438
mix soil um in the winter at my location

115
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:58,639
because you can't really do it indoors

116
00:03:55,438 --> 00:04:00,158
where we are um so i had this you know

117
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:02,479
like okay i'm gonna do a bunch of soil

118
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:05,438
testing i got a bunch of different soils

119
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:06,878
and tested them out and um you know

120
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:09,120
found one that i thought that was really

121
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:12,239
great we sort of standardized on that

122
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,239
things went pretty well and um you know

123
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,959
their their internal recipes sort of

124
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:19,439
changed and it really created um a lot

125
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:22,639
of problems and basically we had way too

126
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:24,639
much nitrogen is what happened um

127
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,000
and then i think that's probably when i

128
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,720
started reaching out to you i was

129
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,478
listening to your podcast which

130
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,080
i'll interject here i actually really

131
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:34,478
wanted to say thank you for doing the

132
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:36,478
podcast because you know you have a lot

133
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:37,918
of really amazing people come on your

134
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:40,478
podcast and

135
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:42,000
i'm really flattered and like

136
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:43,439
a little beside myself to be on it

137
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,839
because i think that

138
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:48,319
um most of the people that come on have

139
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:49,519
really in-depth knowledge on specific

140
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:51,918
subjects and

141
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:53,839
kind of my background is is more

142
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:56,399
somebody who's just you know figured out

143
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:58,000
the living soil thing in one specific

144
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:58,959
application so

145
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,639
um

146
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:02,079
i just really you know thank you for

147
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,519
doing the podcast and i've connected

148
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:05,839
with a lot of people you've had on which

149
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:06,719
have been really great resources for me

150
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:08,799
um

151
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,639
so anyway so i reached out to you and

152
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,000
you know basically everybody i knew like

153
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,759
just whoever would

154
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,720
talk to me at that point like everybody

155
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,400
you know

156
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,880
is having problems you just call people

157
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:20,799
who might be able to help you um

158
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:22,240
and that's when you know

159
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,759
i made the decision of like okay i'm

160
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,199
gonna try to learn how to manage my own

161
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,600
soil

162
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,319
and we started moving up to larger pots

163
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,759
and

164
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:31,918
you know by the time i got to about 20

165
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,319
gallon pot that's when things were i

166
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:35,198
just noticed the mending is a lot easier

167
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:37,120
um

168
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,639
you know it's it's the inconsistencies

169
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,079
sort of go away and it's not like

170
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,879
everything was perfect

171
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:44,319
um but it was

172
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:45,918
we weren't threading the needle anymore

173
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:47,038
to get a crop to finish the way we

174
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:49,599
wanted to

175
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:53,680
um and that's when you know

176
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:55,919
we did our first you know test bed um we

177
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,759
it was about a yard of soil that we put

178
00:05:55,918 --> 00:05:58,719
in and we did a test and we did side by

179
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,879
side

180
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,720
um and it was

181
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:04,959
night and day and i was really nervous

182
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,120
about going to larger to these huge beds

183
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:10,318
about how to move them around and

184
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:13,680
if we're going to move around and

185
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,879
it really just made things a lot simpler

186
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,240
and

187
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:19,120
you know more manageable and more

188
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,120
consistent for us

189
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:23,359
yeah well i i first off thanks for the

190
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,680
nice words and i appreciate you coming

191
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,479
on the podcast um i think it's important

192
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,280
to offer a grower's experience uh from

193
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:34,159
time to time and i think your story was

194
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:36,638
really unique um i do i actually think i

195
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,240
met you when you were still mixing your

196
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,478
own soil because i remember you were top

197
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,560
dressing with a lot of um

198
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:45,519
different amendments um and you were

199
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,600
using piano at the time and um you were

200
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:49,519
like trying to go off of what the plant

201
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,639
was doing and then you would add the

202
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:52,478
amendment

203
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,800
so you were always playing ketchup in

204
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:56,719
these pots yeah yeah and yeah in the

205
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,439
guano i remember that one specifically

206
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,479
because

207
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:00,639
um

208
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:02,639
that was one of our least reliable

209
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,319
amendments it was like you know you can

210
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,000
put the same amount in and that's when i

211
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,360
started really to

212
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,680
um

213
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,038
just notice like okay this is a this is

214
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,160
a product you're buying and it's got

215
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:14,079
these

216
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,520
numbers on the front of the but it's an

217
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:17,199
organic product and it's going to break

218
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:18,879
down and iguano was a lot of times it

219
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,840
was really hot it would just

220
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:23,360
you know we just overdo it so um yeah i

221
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:24,638
remember that we definitely talked about

222
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,160
the guano i think he steered me away

223
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,519
from it

224
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,840
yeah yeah and you just i remember you

225
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:32,879
had a lot of variables going on so

226
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:34,719
between the small plots and the

227
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:37,038
the various amendments and then trying

228
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,680
to diagnose the deficiency it can be it

229
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:41,120
can be really challenging um and i know

230
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,959
we i think i talked to you in the

231
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,038
slightly larger pots i i tried to talk

232
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:46,719
you into beds and you were like there's

233
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:48,878
just no way in this facility you were

234
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,039
adamant that it was impossible

235
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:53,599
um yeah but when you went to the larger

236
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:56,159
pots the plants got better

237
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:57,839
um not perfect like you said but i think

238
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,319
that solved some of it and then i

239
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:01,918
remember um i think i actually may have

240
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,840
mentioned this soil company to you

241
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:05,918
because i just knowing where you were

242
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:07,439
um was hoping that that would be a good

243
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:08,560
solution for you

244
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:10,639
and then

245
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,918
you you describe what you were seeing

246
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,000
when you when we talked about the

247
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:16,159
nitrogen thing because i didn't

248
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,439
notice it until i saw the soil test but

249
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,080
you had a buddy come in there that was

250
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:20,800
really good at looking at plants um yeah

251
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:22,159
yeah

252
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,000
i had a friend

253
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,039
yep i had a friend who'd

254
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,560
you know

255
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:28,240
been growing for a real long time and he

256
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,319
basically just casually mentioned this

257
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,199
nitrogen toxicity that i had going on

258
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,560
and i was like i don't know what you're

259
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,240
talking about

260
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:36,239
um and it was just like really dark

261
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,240
curled leaves especially on you know

262
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,639
ones that don't get as much light

263
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,440
and um you know that sort of brought up

264
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:44,080
the

265
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,000
the idea of that and then um

266
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,759
you know we got some soil analysis back

267
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,639
and the nitrates were just like through

268
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:50,559
the roof

269
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:52,080
um and that actually

270
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:54,000
you know i hadn't realized it but i

271
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,600
might i wasn't having as much success in

272
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,360
veg i was getting these like

273
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,360
kind of really

274
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,120
leafy bally plants that just weren't

275
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,320
they weren't growing the same and the

276
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,440
root zones weren't doing what they

277
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,839
normally do

278
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,480
um so i think it actually was hurting me

279
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,480
more in veg than i realized um he

280
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,759
noticed it in the flower room so then we

281
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,879
just looked at the soil analysis i

282
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:14,399
remember i shot it too because i didn't

283
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:16,000
know anything about looking at a soil

284
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,839
analysis at the time

285
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,120
and then you were the one who who

286
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,519
brought that up

287
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,879
and then

288
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,120
yeah so

289
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:27,679
at that point i was like okay so

290
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,879
if i buy a product it's just like i

291
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:32,399
i can't really rely on anything

292
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:33,759
the quality control of another

293
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,839
organization and that's when i really

294
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:38,159
made the decision to

295
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:40,080
really learn how to um

296
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:41,759
you know manage my soil and i you know i

297
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,278
read like the steve solomon book the

298
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:46,000
intelligent gardener probably listen to

299
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:48,240
that podcast like five or six times

300
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,440
um and that's what sort of engaged me in

301
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:54,240
really trying to be basically the idea

302
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,399
that i was going after with reusing the

303
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,159
soil is one i mean it's the economics

304
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,039
and the sustainability of it but also

305
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:00,559
it's

306
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,838
if you can manage your own soil you're

307
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:03,759
in control of your own destiny you're

308
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,279
not kind of hoping that the thing that

309
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:06,639
you've been buying all along hasn't

310
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:09,360
changed and it's

311
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:11,519
in organics that's a that's a big

312
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:15,039
big thing i mean you know organic

313
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:16,399
products just aren't as consistent

314
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:19,759
yeah that's i think that's a really good

315
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:21,519
point uh i i found

316
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:23,360
i've heard this story a couple times not

317
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,519
just with soil but with bottle nutrients

318
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,600
too with with companies changing the

319
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:30,959
formulation and growers being aware of

320
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,879
it and then having issues potentially

321
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:34,799
but then there can also be mixing issues

322
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:36,879
with with batches and things like that

323
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:38,719
too so that's that's absolutely a

324
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:41,439
legitimate concern right

325
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:44,160
um now you got into the soil testing you

326
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,160
really dove with both feet into that um

327
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:47,600
i think your engineering brain kicked in

328
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:49,679
and

329
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,519
gave you some quantifiable numbers to

330
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:54,319
allow you to

331
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,919
really look at what was going on

332
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,079
in your room and have some numbers to

333
00:10:55,919 --> 00:11:00,000
support it um

334
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:01,759
and this is i think a really interesting

335
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,839
aspect of this because you got really

336
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:05,120
heavy in the soil testing and now you've

337
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,200
kind of

338
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,879
backed away a little bit from that can

339
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,959
you kind of talk a little bit about that

340
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:13,200
process

341
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:14,639
yeah for sure the uh the steve solomon

342
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,920
book the intelligent gardener like he

343
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:18,078
goes through

344
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:19,360
um when i read that book he basically

345
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:20,799
goes through how to do all your own

346
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,159
calculations for you know if you're

347
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:23,519
going to use these amendments how to

348
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:26,000
break down what the

349
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,360
you know numbers on the bags mean and

350
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,120
be able to

351
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,079
you know do your amendments to hit your

352
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,839
targets

353
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:33,838
um and uh yeah like the engineering

354
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:36,240
brain definitely was like okay this is

355
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,120
like i love math like let's do this

356
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,320
whole thing so i got the whole

357
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,399
spreadsheet going and um definitely went

358
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:45,278
all in on the

359
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,320
you know the math of it all

360
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:47,200
and then

361
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,640
you know

362
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,030
i wouldn't say quickly but i think over

363
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:51,360
time i really started to

364
00:11:50,029 --> 00:11:53,199
[Music]

365
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,278
see that the soil analysis results

366
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,240
didn't always make sense

367
00:11:55,278 --> 00:11:59,360
and then through that process i kind of

368
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,000
talked with

369
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:04,079
um so i've always used logan labs and i

370
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,919
talked with susan in the lab there and

371
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:07,519
kind of really was trying to understand

372
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:09,199
like okay so what happens like after i

373
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,039
take a soil

374
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,560
sample and send it to you like

375
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:15,039
you know because i was trying to

376
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:18,479
duplicate just you know basic things

377
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:19,919
like ph and ec if i

378
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,200
before i send it to them and then see

379
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:23,278
that i'm getting the same result from

380
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:26,320
there and i'm getting a lot of variance

381
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:28,159
um just on basically you know

382
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,760
soluble salt just

383
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:31,759
it was i would i would get numbers that

384
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:34,480
were orders of magnitude different

385
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:36,639
um when i tested that same you know

386
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,519
sample that i took and then sent it to

387
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,159
them

388
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,399
and then the um and i just learned more

389
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:44,480
about how they do their testing and you

390
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,720
know where some of the variances are

391
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,720
and you know the the

392
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,160
sample size was one of the things i

393
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,399
remember susan

394
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:54,399
telling me about and the fact that like

395
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,600
those soil analysis were never really

396
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,000
meant for

397
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,079
um indoor soilless media they're meant

398
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,480
for field soils which are mostly mineral

399
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:05,199
soils and you know she's like i can't

400
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,560
even do a um i have to like see your

401
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,079
material it doesn't sift through the

402
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:09,919
sieve it just clogs it up because of so

403
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:12,399
much organic matter you know like we

404
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:14,559
have 25 organic matter which is that

405
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,000
doesn't really exist in most field soils

406
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:17,199
as far as i know

407
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,639
um

408
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,320
so they can't even really do the test

409
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,759
exactly the same way and then it's such

410
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,680
a small sample

411
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:24,799
which in again in field soils isn't

412
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:27,278
going to matter it's just much more

413
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:29,759
homogeneous but with um you know indoor

414
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:31,838
soils if you get a clump of perlite or a

415
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:33,759
clump of whoever knows what like a you

416
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,120
know a little sulfur ball or whatever

417
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:37,278
you're just going to get more scatter in

418
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,799
your results

419
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:39,919
so then i started doing even more

420
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:42,240
testing

421
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:44,078
which got quite expensive i would do

422
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,759
multiple so i kind of have averages to

423
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:47,198
look at

424
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:49,838
and then i just kind of backed away from

425
00:13:47,198 --> 00:13:52,159
that quite a bit and i still do soil

426
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,160
testing every round on every bed

427
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:55,198
but i'm really looking at more of that

428
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:57,198
as a

429
00:13:55,198 --> 00:13:59,759
pattern and i can

430
00:13:57,198 --> 00:14:01,359
know what the soil result looked like

431
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:03,039
from the previous run and when i added

432
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,240
for amendments and then if something

433
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:07,599
doesn't look right i have a pretty good

434
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,440
idea now so i use them as a guide now

435
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,959
but i don't really react to any one

436
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:14,399
individual result i ever get anymore um

437
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:16,479
but i still do quite a bit of the

438
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,159
analysis i just

439
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,000
mix it in with

440
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:21,679
intuition and in what i'm seeing a lot

441
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,799
more than i used to because

442
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:24,638
um

443
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:26,879
if you if you took it with all of like

444
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,000
100 accuracy like every bed every round

445
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:30,320
would be getting totally different

446
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,039
amendments and that's just not what's

447
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,040
actually going on

448
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:37,439
yeah so the sample size

449
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:39,679
it does so a couple of things i want to

450
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,040
highlight um that i've learned not just

451
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:42,638
from you but from

452
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:44,240
people like bryant at soul doctor

453
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,320
consulting and bill mckibben over at

454
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,600
logan and talking to their lab because

455
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,519
you were the one that actually brought

456
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,959
to my attention that how small i think

457
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,560
it was like a half a teaspoon or

458
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:54,719
something that they're using on the m3

459
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:56,319
test is that right whatever i think it

460
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,320
was two milliliters or something like

461
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:01,360
that i can't remember now but it was i

462
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,278
remember like asking her like

463
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,720
is that yeah it's not two teaspoons

464
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:06,799
because i was sending them like a baggie

465
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,399
full of soil like a sandwich bag yeah

466
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:10,159
and then i'm like that's what's going

467
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,000
into the analysis so if you took 10

468
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:13,439
different samples from that same bag

469
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,720
you'd get 10 different results and she's

470
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,920
like 100

471
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,759
yeah and then

472
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:19,919
you know bill and susan both were like

473
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:21,360
you know really steering towards the

474
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:23,919
saturated taste

475
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,759
um so now i do both but anyway sorry to

476
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:28,159
interrupt you no that's great and and

477
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:30,958
this so just to remind people um i

478
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:32,399
actually heard this analogy uh in the in

479
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:35,119
the soil and mineral group through erica

480
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,399
reinheimer recently um a link to an

481
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,480
article that was talking about the

482
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,399
differences between the malik 3 which is

483
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,199
the standard test and the

484
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:45,919
saturated paste so the the malik 3 is a

485
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:48,000
acid extraction i think it's a 2.5 ph

486
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:50,319
acid that they use um so it's a really

487
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,600
strong acid in that it will tell you

488
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,959
everything that's in the soil that's

489
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,320
sort of your savings account but it

490
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:55,599
doesn't really tell you what's available

491
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,600
right now and they look at that like

492
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,879
that's where the saturated pace comes in

493
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,320
which they were calling sort of your

494
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:01,600
checking account and

495
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,480
you know for some people that may be a

496
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,560
useful analogy

497
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,240
one other pointer with a saturated paste

498
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:09,838
is you can send in your own water sample

499
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,360
with logan too and that will give you a

500
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,279
more accurate result as to what's being

501
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,600
released to your plant based off of your

502
00:16:13,278 --> 00:16:17,600
water not the deionized water that they

503
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,879
use as a default if you don't send in

504
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,879
water so

505
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:22,480
a couple of pointers there i

506
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:25,198
still lean fairly heavily on the

507
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:27,039
standard but most agronomists who i

508
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:29,359
respect and people that i know lean more

509
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:31,679
towards the saturated pace so i think

510
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,000
that's more my

511
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:35,599
my lack of education on it

512
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,600
but i can look pretty quickly at a test

513
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,920
and at least at least figure out like

514
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,040
what the most likely limiting factor of

515
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:42,958
growth is

516
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:45,198
and that's right what i think is most

517
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:46,879
useful about these tests um

518
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:48,719
and and i don't know that you know you

519
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:50,000
necessarily need to test every bed what

520
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,680
one thing that bryant and i have talked

521
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,759
about offline is that

522
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:55,359
um when we see a grower that tests every

523
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,480
bed and then they also do a sample where

524
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,039
they take all the beds and mix them

525
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,639
together assuming all the plants were

526
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:03,120
you know the the treatments across the

527
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,798
beds were standardized and the plants

528
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,959
are all relatively doing what you don't

529
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:08,160
have like this one problem bed

530
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,919
um

531
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,079
the results end up being within a you

532
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,360
know a standard deviation a range where

533
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:15,119
uh you don't you know you could save

534
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:18,078
that money because the tests do get very

535
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:19,678
expensive like you mentioned so yeah

536
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:21,279
have you found that that sort of mirrors

537
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,880
what you're you were seeing on your end

538
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:24,959
too or

539
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,000
yeah yeah very much actually so

540
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,360
um

541
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,679
yeah i shouldn't really say that i test

542
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:31,439
every bed every run anymore so

543
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,720
um in in the

544
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,120
you know

545
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,558
in my older room the the beds are still

546
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:39,279
one yard each

547
00:17:36,558 --> 00:17:41,038
and i used to test every bed every round

548
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:43,678
and now what i do is i do them in groups

549
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:46,480
of three so there's basically six

550
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,160
um you know volumes of soil that i'm

551
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,640
amending because i do you know i sort of

552
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,400
do like av testing if i'm gonna like

553
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,120
um you know try out a different

554
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,880
amendment or a different um target on

555
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:58,719
something so a lot of times i have like

556
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,120
a cultivar that i'm running

557
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,319
you know four beds in the same room so

558
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:03,199
i'll do like

559
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:04,639
you know

560
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,720
different i'll have like two be a

561
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,240
control and then um you know two of

562
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,079
those beds will be control beds and then

563
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,440
i'll do one with like you know let's say

564
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:13,038
i'm gonna try

565
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,440
adding nitrogen at different points or

566
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:16,879
something one will be like some nitrogen

567
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,640
here and then another one might be more

568
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,840
so i'll sort of use them

569
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,919
um

570
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:23,519
to do tests against each other so i do i

571
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:25,679
kind of have six pods in there the way i

572
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:28,000
think of it in that room and then in the

573
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:30,240
newer room those beds are three yards

574
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,240
each and then i just take one sample

575
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,440
from each one of those beds well we take

576
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,000
three samples and then do like a

577
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,038
composite mix it up so there's only one

578
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,599
um

579
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:43,359
yeah so in in something like 20 yards of

580
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:45,918
soil per room i'm taking like six tests

581
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:47,439
which does save quite a bit of money um

582
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:51,600
and i

583
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:54,798
actually i look at the saturated taste

584
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:56,719
as more actionable than the

585
00:18:54,798 --> 00:18:59,119
standard test nowadays sort of like what

586
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,360
um you were saying i think the calcium

587
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:04,079
is the big one on the standard that just

588
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:05,038
throws everything out of whack um

589
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:08,000
because

590
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:09,519
it tells you how this incredibly high

591
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,038
amount of calcium you don't need to

592
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:12,798
amend anything and then i'll look at the

593
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:14,798
ppms on the um

594
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:16,558
on the saturated paste and

595
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:18,000
you know this was one of the first times

596
00:19:16,558 --> 00:19:19,599
that i was like okay this saturated

597
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,558
paste is super important because i was

598
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:22,719
seeing that

599
00:19:20,558 --> 00:19:25,038
um you know it's having 50 ppm of

600
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,519
calcium when the standard was showing

601
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:29,839
insanely high numbers

602
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:32,639
so now i kind of disregard the calcium

603
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:35,038
on the standard and really watch it more

604
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,280
on the saturated paste and i could track

605
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:38,558
that with results and

606
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:39,519
you know justin your friend justin

607
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:41,918
mcgill

608
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:43,440
um you know he's he was a really good

609
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:45,840
person to talk about that as well and he

610
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,798
shared some of his data um and i've been

611
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:48,798
able to

612
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:50,720
you know really identify

613
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:52,480
that pattern of making sure you have

614
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,160
enough calcium

615
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,400
on the saturated paste and that's what

616
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,440
sort of drove me that direction and now

617
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,120
um

618
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,120
you know i took bryant's course too the

619
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:02,879
um his i don't remember what was called

620
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:04,719
but it's like that cannabis course on

621
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,240
his uh on his website

622
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,679
and that really connected a ton of dots

623
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,519
for me and he does

624
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,280
you know talk about how to weigh the two

625
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:12,879
um which was kind of what i was already

626
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:13,759
doing and it really it connected a lot

627
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,640
of

628
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:17,119
um

629
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:19,200
it connected a lot of things for me and

630
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:20,639
really made a lot of sense so

631
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,480
you know that was that was really

632
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,480
helpful for me

633
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,599
how to use all of his exact targets but

634
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,759
i think that

635
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:29,279
the methodology of a lot of that was

636
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:31,200
really helpful

637
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:33,918
yeah and i will say one one thing to

638
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,279
mention is that steve solomon's book was

639
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:38,080
really designed for people growing

640
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:40,558
vegetables in actual soil and it wasn't

641
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:42,240
designed around maximizing yield it was

642
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:44,319
designed around

643
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,079
increasing nutrient density so he gets

644
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:48,720
much more involved with trace trace

645
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:51,119
minerals and his targets are not

646
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:53,440
optimal i would say for cannabis and i

647
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:55,839
think he would admit that too that that

648
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,360
wasn't the initial goal with his with

649
00:20:55,839 --> 00:21:00,240
his writing so

650
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:02,319
uh bryant's targets are i think much

651
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,400
better for cannabis but again you're

652
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:06,158
going to want to make adjustments for

653
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,000
your own facility

654
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:11,440
just a just to plug brian's class i've

655
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,640
taken it too it's it is excellent

656
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,320
if you want to learn how to do this

657
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,960
stuff yourself i think that's the best

658
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:19,839
resource online and there is a coupon

659
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:22,240
code for uh if you put in kiss organics

660
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:24,720
in in on the website you'll save i think

661
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:27,599
100 bucks off the test or 150 i can't

662
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,519
remember but or off the course so

663
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:31,439
uh shameless plug there i'll throw that

664
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:33,599
in there um

665
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,640
bryant's brian had that coupon code when

666
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:36,959
i took it

667
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,840
you should have uh i'm sorry about that

668
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,759
um

669
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:42,959
yeah yeah so it's a good it's a good

670
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:44,158
course and it's interactive too so um

671
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,400
yeah if people want to learn more they

672
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:48,960
can definitely check that out so

673
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,240
yeah just wanted to mention that

674
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,759
um

675
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,319
so in terms of the in terms of the

676
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:56,839
testing now i think you bring up a good

677
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:59,759
point so you find that the tests give

678
00:21:56,839 --> 00:22:01,839
you good actional information but they

679
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:03,679
don't tell the whole story can you talk

680
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:05,759
a little bit more

681
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:08,159
about that

682
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:09,679
um yeah i mean i mean the way you said

683
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:12,080
it kind of sums it up pretty well i mean

684
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:13,038
i i definitely do all of the testing

685
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:13,918
because

686
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:15,359
um

687
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,919
i feel like with no testing i'm just

688
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:18,959
kind of flying blind because i do see

689
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,200
that the

690
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,200
you know

691
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:25,519
like i'm not amending the same thing

692
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:28,000
every round and i do see

693
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:30,480
the need like to change the amendments

694
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,319
every round so if i didn't do

695
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,360
any testing i would feel like i would

696
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:35,759
have really

697
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:36,959
you know a pretty vague idea how to do

698
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:39,119
the next rounds amendment and it'll

699
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,200
probably be fine but successively i

700
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:43,038
think that it would be tougher to course

701
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,038
correct um

702
00:22:43,038 --> 00:22:46,240
without really ever seeing what those

703
00:22:45,038 --> 00:22:46,960
changes are

704
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,640
so

705
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,720
you know i don't look at the individuals

706
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:53,200
i just more look at the trajectory and

707
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,279
the patterns that i see um

708
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,679
and you know i do trust that i think at

709
00:22:55,279 --> 00:23:00,158
one point i was really like okay

710
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:02,080
these tests are just too erratic and i

711
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,679
can't really make good judgments on them

712
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:05,119
um and now i've kind of come around the

713
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:07,120
other way where

714
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:09,759
you know like i have

715
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:12,319
a history of the testing in in in the

716
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:14,879
facility in the beds and i know

717
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:16,639
in general um where i want to be and if

718
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,080
things are you know like sometimes i'll

719
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,159
just get an insanely

720
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:21,678
ridiculous number on on something and i

721
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,360
just disregard it completely it's just

722
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:25,519
an outlier which means

723
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:27,759
nothing but if i see you know on all six

724
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:29,599
or seven tests from the same room

725
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:30,960
they're like okay i have

726
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:33,519
plenty of nitrogen right now i'm not

727
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,440
gonna amend any nitrogen

728
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:37,119
or um you know it doesn't really ever

729
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,840
happen with potassium i can't seem to

730
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:40,319
add

731
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:41,119
enough potassium um

732
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:42,000
but

733
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:44,239
you know

734
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
that information is still it's critical

735
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,919
to what i do every round

736
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,038
but i just i'm looking more at it as a

737
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:53,038
trend or a pattern

738
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:54,158
of what i'm seeing in the roman analyze

739
00:23:53,038 --> 00:23:55,440
i think that

740
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:57,520
that answer your question is kind of

741
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,840
vague but

742
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:03,038
yeah i find the two levers that we pull

743
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:04,798
the most on with our soils and tests and

744
00:24:03,038 --> 00:24:08,240
this is a lot reflected with justin's

745
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:10,879
test too is usually nitrates and

746
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:13,599
calcium so we'll see sometimes we'll see

747
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:15,760
too much calcium over time

748
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:17,759
build up but again we have to watch that

749
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:19,440
availability on the saturated paste but

750
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:21,599
then nitrates that's the other one that

751
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,759
for some reason will show up and i think

752
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:26,079
some of that is just in these in these

753
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:28,158
large beds you have all these worm

754
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:30,079
populations that explode over time and

755
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:32,400
then break down

756
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:33,678
additional organic matter and are

757
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,200
releasing

758
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:36,400
uh minerals and so we kind of have to

759
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,720
keep an eye on that because i've had

760
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,559
runs with justin where we don't amend at

761
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,400
all or we just add

762
00:24:40,558 --> 00:24:43,599
a little bit of egg sulfur or something

763
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,000
very very minor maybe a little bit of

764
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:49,199
potassium sulfate but have to cut back

765
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,480
completely just because we see nitrates

766
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,080
showing up yeah

767
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,880
really high even though they didn't add

768
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:56,960
a lot of nitrogen around before

769
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,159
so yep it's kind of interesting one of

770
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,038
the things that i

771
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:03,679
one of the things that i think i've um

772
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:05,839
you know started to hone in on and and

773
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:07,679
it solidified for me during um when i

774
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:10,720
was taking the course with uh

775
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:12,159
with bryant was the compost because

776
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,679
that wasn't really something that i had

777
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:15,039
an analysis on it wasn't something that

778
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:17,120
i was really

779
00:25:15,038 --> 00:25:19,759
factoring in much so when you're adding

780
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:21,199
compost every round

781
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:22,558
it can take a really long time for that

782
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,480
compost to

783
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:25,200
you know release its nitrogen

784
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,919
and

785
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,200
you know like i'm really speaking right

786
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:30,880
outside my lane here but i'm gonna do it

787
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,038
anyway um so he's talking about the

788
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,120
carbon to nitrogen ratio

789
00:25:33,038 --> 00:25:36,319
i think like anything like over 20 it

790
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:38,719
can actually be

791
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:40,240
a nitrogen sink if i remember what he

792
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,600
said correctly

793
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,480
and i was looking at some of the compost

794
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:48,319
i was using and it was 22 23

795
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:49,759
um carbon and nitrogen um

796
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:52,079
and

797
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:53,519
so i think in my case what might have

798
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:55,759
been happening is i was adding compost

799
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:58,240
was actually a sink for a little while

800
00:25:55,759 --> 00:26:00,240
and then you know months later it was

801
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,400
this wave of nitrogen that was coming

802
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,798
out possibly from the compost

803
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,400
and you know justin and i actually had

804
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:08,158
the same sort of

805
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,600
nitrogen surge

806
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,640
at the same time when he was cutting

807
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:13,199
back his

808
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,799
amendments for uh for nitrate i was too

809
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,640
and it was also during the summer so i

810
00:26:14,798 --> 00:26:18,798
have a it's a little bit far-fetched but

811
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,799
i'm going to do it anyways this summer

812
00:26:18,798 --> 00:26:23,918
um i'm going to send in a refrigerated

813
00:26:20,798 --> 00:26:25,519
sample of soil and then one you know in

814
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:27,360
the heat of summer because one of my

815
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:29,599
theories is that possibly the nitrates

816
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:31,918
is changing just during the course of

817
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:33,759
um it being shipped and then getting

818
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:35,038
tested a week later and i don't i don't

819
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:36,879
know what your opinion on that is but

820
00:26:35,038 --> 00:26:38,558
i'm i'm going to test either way because

821
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,720
i'm just curious it was

822
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:41,759
both of us had this nitrogen surge in

823
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,640
the summer

824
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:44,879
um

825
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,559
but i also did see you know high

826
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,320
nitrogen my plants and i didn't demand

827
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:51,359
and i didn't run out of nitrogen so

828
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:53,759
there was a bunch of nitrogen in my soil

829
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:55,439
yeah so when i what we look for too is

830
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:57,119
to just for people that are testing is

831
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,480
not total nitrogen that's not a very

832
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:00,959
useful number but you want to look at

833
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,798
nitrates and ammonium and then right

834
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,440
that ammonium number should be very low

835
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:09,200
like below one um a lot of times it

836
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:11,200
doesn't even register on our tests

837
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,038
because if that number is high what

838
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,720
that's telling us is that there's

839
00:27:13,038 --> 00:27:16,640
there's still organic matter it's still

840
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:19,360
hot that's going to break down and

841
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:21,120
release into nitrates

842
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:22,558
and it gets a little tricky that tells

843
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:24,639
me that you used probably unfinished

844
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:26,960
compost most likely

845
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,240
into the bed whereas that nitrate number

846
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,798
is fairly

847
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,798
is is a fairly useful

848
00:27:30,798 --> 00:27:34,000
number in determining how much nitrogen

849
00:27:32,798 --> 00:27:35,599
your plant's going to have available

850
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,038
that cycle and you can have target we

851
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:39,678
have targets around that for depending

852
00:27:37,038 --> 00:27:41,119
on what week you're in

853
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:43,360
but i haven't thought about it in terms

854
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:46,479
of the temperature of that soil if the

855
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:49,278
microbiology due to the heat and travel

856
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,720
in the in the mail could somehow affect

857
00:27:49,278 --> 00:27:52,720
that that's interesting i hadn't thought

858
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:56,079
of that variable there's always other

859
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:58,240
variables you don't consider and then

860
00:27:56,079 --> 00:28:00,639
yeah i remember i talked to um i talked

861
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:03,038
to susan logan about it and she was like

862
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,880
maybe she seems kind of skeptical but

863
00:28:03,038 --> 00:28:06,319
she was like it's possible like it's not

864
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,640
going to

865
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:10,000
it's not going to stay exactly the same

866
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,080
you know so the question is how much

867
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,359
does it vary so i'm like okay once once

868
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:14,639
we get some hot weather again i'm going

869
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:16,798
to send in

870
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:19,200
you know a pack that's a little ziplock

871
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:21,519
that's nice and refrigerated and kind of

872
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:24,080
not doing anything and then sending

873
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:27,440
another one to the regular mail

874
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:29,038
so yeah i will say though like like you

875
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,120
what we found with justin was there

876
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:32,720
still was sufficient nitrogen next cycle

877
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:34,719
so the test was

878
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,839
relatively accurate no i'm in that

879
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,720
regard

880
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:38,798
um

881
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:41,038
yeah i pulled back on my compost

882
00:28:38,798 --> 00:28:43,119
amendments quite a bit so i i just don't

883
00:28:41,038 --> 00:28:44,398
add as much compost and i end up adding

884
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:46,319
more

885
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:47,278
other nitrogen amendments

886
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:48,398
and

887
00:28:47,278 --> 00:28:49,278
you know

888
00:28:48,398 --> 00:28:50,798
that

889
00:28:49,278 --> 00:28:52,640
seems to be working well for me right

890
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:54,480
now it's a something i started doing

891
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,840
like maybe about a year ago

892
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,960
um

893
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:58,720
yeah and i don't i don't think you

894
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,120
necessarily have to

895
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:03,200
add compost every cycle um

896
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:04,719
yeah so that's that's a that's a valid

897
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,640
point too because you're also going to

898
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,798
be bringing in fungus gnats potentially

899
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,559
every time you bring in compost or

900
00:29:08,798 --> 00:29:11,679
you can definitely bring them

901
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:13,759
every time

902
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:15,600
yeah yeah so that's that's one thing

903
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:17,119
about compost that's a little bit

904
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:19,199
challenging or any soil that has a

905
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:21,038
compost fraction it's it's relatively

906
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,399
unavoidable

907
00:29:21,038 --> 00:29:25,278
um

908
00:29:22,398 --> 00:29:27,678
well let's talk a little bit i want to

909
00:29:25,278 --> 00:29:30,079
i kind of want to go back to this idea

910
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:31,919
of all the variables that you consider

911
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:33,759
when evaluating your plants beyond just

912
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,919
soil testing because

913
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:37,759
i know for us like when we get a soil

914
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:40,000
test from someone i have a series of

915
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:41,440
questions that i needed that i feel like

916
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,599
i need to get information on to make an

917
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:46,000
accurate recommendation i i'm not

918
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:47,918
comfortable doing it off of just a test

919
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,440
alone because like when i started you

920
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:50,880
know it was like you was with that

921
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,480
solomon's book that was where i really

922
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,559
started learning about mineral balancing

923
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,759
and albrecht and and started going down

924
00:29:54,558 --> 00:29:56,639
that whole

925
00:29:55,759 --> 00:29:58,558
uh

926
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,640
that whole path um

927
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:03,038
and i was just using the grow abundant

928
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,880
calculator that erica reinheimer put

929
00:30:03,038 --> 00:30:06,879
together it's a it's a good resource if

930
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,880
like if you just want a quick and easy

931
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,240
test like i use it for

932
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,360
my garden beds if i don't feel like

933
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,880
doing math

934
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:15,119
you can just plug the numbers right in

935
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,200
the subscription is very affordable and

936
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:18,479
it'll spit out something that's

937
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,319
based off of

938
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,798
their book the intelligent gardener she

939
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:25,200
was a she was a co-author on that

940
00:30:22,798 --> 00:30:27,278
but if it's for my cannabis plants and

941
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,798
we're talking about really maximizing

942
00:30:27,278 --> 00:30:30,558
fertility

943
00:30:28,798 --> 00:30:33,278
there's a lot more variable there than

944
00:30:30,558 --> 00:30:35,440
just a soil test like i know i want to

945
00:30:33,278 --> 00:30:37,599
know what the co2 levels are they're

946
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:40,640
running in the in the facility and what

947
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:42,398
the light levels are at canopy and maybe

948
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,320
a little about what type of genetics and

949
00:30:42,398 --> 00:30:46,879
how long are you vegging and flowering

950
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:48,960
and what size are your containers and

951
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:51,039
how are you watering um

952
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,440
there's you know there's a whole list of

953
00:30:51,038 --> 00:30:54,960
things there and and i see photos of the

954
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,960
plants how did your plants finish are

955
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,880
you happy with where they finished and

956
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,079
the yields and all of those things go

957
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,640
into

958
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:04,720
the analysis it's not just you can look

959
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:07,278
at a number on a test and then

960
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:09,360
make a recommendation

961
00:31:07,278 --> 00:31:11,119
yeah totally agree

962
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:14,398
um so are there any other things that

963
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:16,879
you really look at to when you're

964
00:31:14,398 --> 00:31:18,398
when you're going to re-amend the soil

965
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,799
you know take me through sort of i know

966
00:31:18,398 --> 00:31:22,719
i i just stole your thunder a little bit

967
00:31:20,798 --> 00:31:24,798
on that by naming a whole bunch but i

968
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,240
was gonna say you covered a lot there

969
00:31:24,798 --> 00:31:29,119
were there other ones that i didn't you

970
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,558
know miss off top of my head it is

971
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:32,798
yeah one of the things that

972
00:31:30,558 --> 00:31:35,359
has really been really fun and

973
00:31:32,798 --> 00:31:37,918
interesting and eye-opening coming from

974
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:40,879
an engineering background into this is

975
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:42,480
just the amount of things that um the

976
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,519
amount of variables that go into the

977
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,640
process

978
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:46,480
and

979
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,000
you know it's like

980
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,679
like i want to bust out a spreadsheet

981
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,038
that has all of those variables and then

982
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:52,720
i can do like

983
00:31:51,038 --> 00:31:54,240
you know data regression or something

984
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,839
and try to figure out how to optimize

985
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,919
all those parameters and there's just

986
00:31:55,839 --> 00:31:58,720
too many um

987
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:01,038
so

988
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,480
i don't really have like a set process

989
00:32:01,038 --> 00:32:04,158
on that i think it's like one of those

990
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,720
things where you're just you're watching

991
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:09,600
every run as it's going um because even

992
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:11,919
like light spectrum i did um

993
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:14,319
in in my new room i did a bunch of

994
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:16,399
different light types and uh you know

995
00:32:14,319 --> 00:32:18,480
one of them is this um it's a dragon

996
00:32:16,398 --> 00:32:20,158
alpha from science and i really love

997
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,519
those lights and i had all these ideas

998
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:24,080
on how i was going to start messing with

999
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:26,640
the spectrum at different times

1000
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:29,038
during the growth cycle

1001
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:31,679
and do all this testing to you know

1002
00:32:29,038 --> 00:32:33,519
look at the you know red and blue and

1003
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:35,120
all of that and

1004
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:37,599
i've sort of backed off on it because

1005
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:38,798
there's so many other variables um going

1006
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:40,558
on in there

1007
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:42,158
that i i kind of i'm not a good point

1008
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:44,480
where i can like okay really get into

1009
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:46,159
that and consider that as a as a

1010
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,200
an a b test at all

1011
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:48,240
um

1012
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,360
so

1013
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,640
i don't know i mean i think i just

1014
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:52,479
didn't answer your question i think i

1015
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,240
answered the request by saying that

1016
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:57,278
there's a lot of gut feel and i don't

1017
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:59,759
really have um a process other than just

1018
00:32:57,278 --> 00:33:01,200
seeing how that run finished and i'm

1019
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:03,599
kind of always trying something a little

1020
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:06,480
bit new every run trying to dig my

1021
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:08,839
zigzag my way to optimization but it's

1022
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:11,200
just too many things just too many

1023
00:33:08,839 --> 00:33:12,879
things so what you're calling your gut

1024
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,600
is really um

1025
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:19,039
your subconscious giving you

1026
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:20,398
uh feedback based off of experience

1027
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:21,679
because you've done

1028
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:23,119
you know you've been doing this for how

1029
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:25,519
your gut's definitely gotten smarter i

1030
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:27,119
guess is what i'm getting at

1031
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:29,200
i mean how many cycles they have like i

1032
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:31,439
have my ideas on when i see something

1033
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:33,759
going on with a leaf pattern of what i

1034
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:36,159
think that means and you know

1035
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:37,839
i just i really

1036
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:40,159
try to avoid making any solid

1037
00:33:37,839 --> 00:33:41,759
conclusions like okay i know that this

1038
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:43,278
little yellowing on the on the

1039
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:45,278
serrations of the leaves is telling me i

1040
00:33:43,278 --> 00:33:47,440
have a potassium deficiency which is

1041
00:33:45,278 --> 00:33:49,679
what i believe but i also i'm like okay

1042
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,200
that's probably what i think that is

1043
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:53,200
so i'm like taking in all that

1044
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:56,159
information um

1045
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:58,558
and you know and just seeing what

1046
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:59,760
the the pattern of growth like if i

1047
00:33:58,558 --> 00:34:01,759
don't see

1048
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:03,759
that first few weeks that explosion like

1049
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:05,200
i normally do you know then i'm thinking

1050
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:07,359
about what my nitrogen was probably

1051
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:09,760
doing earlier on in

1052
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:11,598
um you know in the flower room and then

1053
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,639
so i might change the way i look at the

1054
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:14,159
um

1055
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:15,280
the nitrogen on the next round or

1056
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,159
something like that because that's the

1057
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:19,040
one that

1058
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:21,280
for me i trust the least on the um on

1059
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:22,159
the analysis i almost

1060
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,240
you know

1061
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:26,639
i just look at and be like okay am i

1062
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:28,319
good here to not amend anything right

1063
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,919
now but even if it's

1064
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,838
higher than i would like it to be i'm

1065
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:33,598
still planning to add something a week

1066
00:34:31,838 --> 00:34:35,039
or two later into flower because i know

1067
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:38,240
it's going to drop down

1068
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:40,079
um or at least that's my mental model

1069
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:41,598
but

1070
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:43,599
yeah i don't know i mean i think you

1071
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:45,838
just

1072
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:47,359
what are you adding then uh just for

1073
00:34:45,838 --> 00:34:49,918
listeners when

1074
00:34:47,358 --> 00:34:51,679
when you are i mean i had a lot of your

1075
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:53,759
yeah i add a lot of your um your

1076
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:56,000
nutrient pack and then

1077
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:58,400
i have a lot of specific amendments um

1078
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,719
you know i add a lot of gypsum potassium

1079
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,559
sulfate i have a few different

1080
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:04,799
nitrogen specific amendments just you

1081
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:06,559
know like alfalfa meal sometimes some

1082
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,960
feather male um

1083
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:09,838
fish bone meal i use a lot of that

1084
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,039
um

1085
00:35:09,838 --> 00:35:11,429
calphos

1086
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:12,719
um

1087
00:35:11,429 --> 00:35:13,519
[Music]

1088
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:14,719
so i

1089
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:17,199
i mean i don't know i think i think i

1090
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:18,799
probably have you know probably about 10

1091
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:20,159
or 12 different things that i use

1092
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,000
regularly

1093
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:23,920
right now i'm doing a whole bunch of

1094
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,320
investigation on micronutrients which

1095
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:28,159
we've already discussed but um

1096
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,680
you know i don't really have a lot of

1097
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:31,440
that stuff on hand in general besides

1098
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:33,279
maybe manganese

1099
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,200
i actually do want to talk to you about

1100
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,720
trace minerals that was a question i was

1101
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:38,078
saving because

1102
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:40,000
oh okay

1103
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:41,760
yeah because in my experience you know

1104
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,559
like if you go the intelligent gardener

1105
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:46,480
route you're adding trace minerals

1106
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:50,078
pretty much every cycle to get a balance

1107
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:53,679
whereas my experience with cannabis and

1108
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:57,440
looking a lot of tests i now won't touch

1109
00:35:53,679 --> 00:36:00,399
trace minerals for at least a few cycles

1110
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:02,480
of testing because i want to so

1111
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:04,400
for me the first thing i look at is ph

1112
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,320
um how available the nutrients gonna be

1113
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:08,160
and then from there you know on the

1114
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:10,000
standard like i'll throw out some

1115
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:11,598
numbers like i don't really worry too

1116
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,000
much about the organic matte percentage

1117
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:15,760
on the standard um bryant has a really

1118
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,159
good explanation on that

1119
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:20,480
the cec on the standard is a very useful

1120
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:22,159
tool with potting soils and again brian

1121
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:24,240
has a good right instagram video

1122
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:25,358
explaining why

1123
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:28,159
um

1124
00:36:25,358 --> 00:36:32,239
but when we talk about uh

1125
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:33,679
trace minerals i i find that uh

1126
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:35,759
the only time i really look at it is if

1127
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:38,559
something looks really really high

1128
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:40,160
or it's just virtually non-existent i

1129
00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:41,920
mean if there's a little bit in there on

1130
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:43,358
showing up on the test then i usually

1131
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:46,400
don't worry about it and just focus on

1132
00:36:43,358 --> 00:36:49,279
my macros but what i know you got into

1133
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:51,760
fiddling there for a little while

1134
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:53,760
yeah i definitely that's what i do yeah

1135
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,880
yeah

1136
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,880
um

1137
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,240
so you know in those

1138
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,240
in that room with the pods as i was

1139
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:02,000
describing i sort of did a

1140
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:03,838
you know three pods were controlled

1141
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,079
where i didn't do any micronutrients and

1142
00:37:03,838 --> 00:37:08,639
then two pods were sort of

1143
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:10,960
um you know one regime of micronutrients

1144
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:13,279
and one pod was another one and then so

1145
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,320
it was basically half the room was

1146
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:17,519
you know

1147
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:18,880
status quo no micronutrient additions um

1148
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:20,480
and then the other one i think i added

1149
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,800
then i ended up adding

1150
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:26,880
um copper zinc manganese i had a lot of

1151
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:28,079
manganese um boron and um

1152
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,320
maybe one other one i can't remember

1153
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,920
right now um

1154
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:33,920
and i do think that that side of the

1155
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:36,400
room has benefited from it more than the

1156
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:38,240
other side but i don't see any there's

1157
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:41,039
no game changers in there the plants

1158
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:42,959
just they seem to be a little less

1159
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:44,719
water stressed i see i just feel like

1160
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,480
they can drink a little easier

1161
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:48,639
um and

1162
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,639
you know i i don't see like any

1163
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:52,639
accelerated growth but

1164
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:54,799
you know when i first put the plants in

1165
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:57,679
there's one cultivar i have which just

1166
00:37:54,800 --> 00:38:00,400
hates me um in veg it's a strawberry

1167
00:37:57,679 --> 00:38:02,799
sour larry which is it always finishes

1168
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:04,800
great but i i have trouble with it and

1169
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:07,760
veg every round it is the first to tell

1170
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:09,200
me if it's pissed off um and that plant

1171
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:11,040
when i put it into the beds that have

1172
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:13,519
the micronutrients and i've done some

1173
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:15,759
micronutrient testing in veg too but

1174
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:18,320
um more sporadically

1175
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,839
when i when i bring that cultivar into

1176
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,519
that room and i put it in the in the

1177
00:38:19,838 --> 00:38:23,119
beds that have had those micronutrient

1178
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:24,480
amendments um

1179
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:26,559
and i don't know like which one it's

1180
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,800
reacting to or just the

1181
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:30,239
all of them combined that plant reacts

1182
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:33,039
more quickly in the beds that have the

1183
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:35,919
micronutrients so it's more like

1184
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:38,000
fine-tuning in general is

1185
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,880
is what i think i'm seeing more than

1186
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
okay

1187
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:44,000
there's this magic micronutrient that

1188
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,880
has been missing that has

1189
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,719
you know

1190
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,640
changed my world or anything

1191
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:51,358
where i'm more interested in doing it is

1192
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:54,400
in um in veg for propagation for taking

1193
00:38:51,358 --> 00:38:57,279
moms um because i do think that there's

1194
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,800
you know propagating organically is

1195
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,240
it's always been the thing i'm the worst

1196
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,519
at

1197
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:03,039
you know they tend to stay in the trays

1198
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:04,239
a little bit longer they don't root as

1199
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:06,320
quickly

1200
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:07,679
i'm not using a rooting gel like a plant

1201
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,480
growth regulator

1202
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:10,480
and

1203
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:12,400
you know that mother plant nutrition the

1204
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,920
health of that mother plant is just that

1205
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,760
much more critical when you're growing

1206
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:18,720
organically

1207
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:21,599
in doing propagation organically so

1208
00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:24,559
i'm really targeting that in in

1209
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:26,559
in veg for propagation purposes and just

1210
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:28,480
getting the healthiest cuttings i can

1211
00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:29,358
to root more quickly because i do think

1212
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,119
that

1213
00:39:29,358 --> 00:39:32,960
potentially with forming calluses like

1214
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:34,559
i've done some experiments on callus

1215
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,599
formation and

1216
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:37,440
you know

1217
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:39,680
on some of them like the strawberry

1218
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:42,400
sarah larry i'm not getting a callus

1219
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:45,118
sometimes for 10 or 11 days so no wonder

1220
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,960
i'm not getting explosive root growth um

1221
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:48,880
you know so i think that

1222
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:51,039
it's one of my theories is that that

1223
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:53,760
whatever it's missing that's really you

1224
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:55,519
know it's upset about veg is probably

1225
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,520
the same thing that's really preventing

1226
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:58,880
it from being able to callous up and um

1227
00:39:57,519 --> 00:40:00,239
and even though like when you take that

1228
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,280
cutting they look great they look

1229
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:03,919
healthy

1230
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:05,839
um because the moms and veg have bigger

1231
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,599
pots

1232
00:40:05,838 --> 00:40:10,239
but as you know after a week and a half

1233
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:12,400
in a tray you can really start to see

1234
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:14,799
that it's not doing as well and you know

1235
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:16,960
if you check for calluses you know they

1236
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,318
just they're not forming at the pace i'd

1237
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,838
like them to and

1238
00:40:18,318 --> 00:40:21,519
i guess my theory is on the

1239
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:23,440
micronutrient is more for propagation

1240
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:26,318
than for flour although i do see

1241
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:28,079
i feel like i see benefits in flower

1242
00:40:26,318 --> 00:40:31,039
okay okay

1243
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:33,039
and uh how many cycles in are you now

1244
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:34,800
with some of your rooms

1245
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:36,639
oh i don't know um

1246
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:39,039
i mean it's like you know

1247
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:40,960
five cycles here in a room so

1248
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:42,159
um in that room i think i'm probably

1249
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,679
with your soil like three and a half

1250
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:45,279
years or something

1251
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:46,799
so

1252
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:50,079
um maybe

1253
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:53,440
15 to 20 range something like that

1254
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:55,119
okay okay awesome um have you had ups

1255
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,960
and downs there in terms of i mean how

1256
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:59,200
much does your yield fluctuate cycle the

1257
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:01,199
cycle

1258
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:02,639
not much it's actually really consistent

1259
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:04,399
right now um

1260
00:41:02,639 --> 00:41:05,679
some of my older cultivars are kind of

1261
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,280
trending down just the vigor is

1262
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:08,879
decreasing

1263
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:11,040
the quality is still

1264
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:13,920
doing great but the yield on some of my

1265
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:14,880
older genetics is kind of declining

1266
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,159
that's one of the other reasons i want

1267
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,599
to look at some micronutrients and

1268
00:41:16,159 --> 00:41:18,799
propagation is

1269
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:20,318
you know there's probably been some

1270
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,160
rounds where the cuttings haven't come

1271
00:41:20,318 --> 00:41:23,599
off of a mom that's as healthy as i

1272
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:25,199
would like and that sort of just tends

1273
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:26,720
to accumulate i think

1274
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:27,759
um

1275
00:41:26,719 --> 00:41:29,759
so

1276
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:31,440
some of my yields have tracked down a

1277
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,359
little bit but then on the newer

1278
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:35,599
cultivars i bring in you know they're

1279
00:41:33,358 --> 00:41:37,279
just smashing again so i don't think

1280
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:38,160
it's a soil thing i think it's just a

1281
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,160
you know

1282
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:43,679
having genetics that have been

1283
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:43,679
propagated for four years you know

1284
00:41:43,838 --> 00:41:47,358
but because the yields are are pretty

1285
00:41:45,679 --> 00:41:49,039
predictable i have a pretty good idea of

1286
00:41:47,358 --> 00:41:52,318
what i'm going to get for yield in each

1287
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:53,838
room on each cultivar at this point

1288
00:41:52,318 --> 00:41:56,960
yeah now one thing we haven't talked

1289
00:41:53,838 --> 00:41:59,279
about as a variable uh when reamending

1290
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,720
soils or evaluating plants is is pest

1291
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,480
pressure

1292
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:04,799
uh are you comfortable touching on that

1293
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:07,599
a little bit

1294
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:10,160
yeah sure i mean i we we did that video

1295
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:11,280
um on instagram with the aphid that was

1296
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:12,078
our

1297
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,040
um

1298
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:15,359
test

1299
00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:16,800
experience really that was really

1300
00:42:15,358 --> 00:42:18,318
traumatic i mean we dealt with a few

1301
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,280
paths over time but we had the cannabis

1302
00:42:18,318 --> 00:42:20,719
aphid

1303
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:23,920
um

1304
00:42:20,719 --> 00:42:25,439
yeah so what was your specific question

1305
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:28,079
oh i guess i was just thinking about

1306
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:29,519
things that will influence um

1307
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:31,039
plant health and yields when we're

1308
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:33,679
talking about re-amending if i'm

1309
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:34,880
re-amending and i know that you know the

1310
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:36,960
you know the

1311
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:40,000
person is battling you know cannabis

1312
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:41,760
aphid or spider mites or thrips or broad

1313
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,599
knights brew defeats whatever

1314
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,280
whatever it may be that can have an

1315
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:47,838
impact on

1316
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:50,240
overall yields and plant health yeah

1317
00:42:47,838 --> 00:42:51,199
depending on how they're managing it

1318
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:53,358
and so

1319
00:42:51,199 --> 00:42:55,039
that also should be factored in when i

1320
00:42:53,358 --> 00:42:56,639
talk about reamending

1321
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:58,800
the soil if they're seeing something on

1322
00:42:56,639 --> 00:43:00,480
the plant well it may not be from slow

1323
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,720
it may not be a soil fertility issue i

1324
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,719
guess

1325
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:06,480
yeah i mean um

1326
00:43:05,039 --> 00:43:08,400
since the cannabis aphid thing we

1327
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:10,000
haven't really had any you know pest

1328
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,160
pressure issues

1329
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:15,280
i put out a lot of beneficial these days

1330
00:43:12,159 --> 00:43:16,960
um i like to think of my facility as

1331
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:18,720
you know just loaded with starving

1332
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,800
insects ready to eat anything that might

1333
00:43:18,719 --> 00:43:23,279
find its way in um

1334
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,560
saw some thrips a little while ago

1335
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,800
you know suzanne's been a really great

1336
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:28,799
resource for me i sent them off to her

1337
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:30,240
you know we did um oh geez i can't

1338
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,039
remember the name of it we did a release

1339
00:43:30,239 --> 00:43:33,279
of

1340
00:43:31,039 --> 00:43:35,358
one of the predatory things for thrips

1341
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,720
and and i've been using cucumaris for

1342
00:43:35,358 --> 00:43:38,400
years now

1343
00:43:36,719 --> 00:43:40,399
and

1344
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,519
we just we saw some thrips on a few

1345
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,358
plants for a little while and they just

1346
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:45,039
thought it went away so we haven't had

1347
00:43:43,358 --> 00:43:47,440
to um

1348
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:50,318
you know deal with them but the uh the

1349
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:51,599
fungus at issue has been um you know

1350
00:43:50,318 --> 00:43:53,920
especially in propagation with the

1351
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:55,039
younger plants the fungus that issue has

1352
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:56,880
been

1353
00:43:55,039 --> 00:43:58,880
you know consistent for us

1354
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:02,160
you know growing organically

1355
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:03,200
so we use a ton of you know nematodes

1356
00:44:02,159 --> 00:44:05,039
and

1357
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:07,118
there's been a couple of times where i

1358
00:44:05,039 --> 00:44:09,279
think the fungus population in the in

1359
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:10,640
the younger plants has kind of stunted

1360
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,720
some of them

1361
00:44:10,639 --> 00:44:14,078
um but not really from like an amendment

1362
00:44:12,719 --> 00:44:15,439
standpoint because i'm not amending that

1363
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:18,640
soil

1364
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:20,720
okay yeah yeah sf nematodes are great

1365
00:44:18,639 --> 00:44:22,239
for dealing with fungus gnats and i

1366
00:44:20,719 --> 00:44:23,759
think they're they're just something

1367
00:44:22,239 --> 00:44:24,879
that people should have as a maintenance

1368
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,680
routine

1369
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,358
um

1370
00:44:25,679 --> 00:44:29,039
yup just just to stay ahead of things

1371
00:44:27,358 --> 00:44:31,440
it's much easier to

1372
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:32,719
to get ahead of it than try and battle

1373
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,838
it so

1374
00:44:32,719 --> 00:44:36,239
yeah i learned that one the hard way

1375
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:39,358
when i had that cannabis after that i

1376
00:44:36,239 --> 00:44:40,399
just loaded up on beneficials and

1377
00:44:39,358 --> 00:44:42,559
um

1378
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:45,440
you know we've been

1379
00:44:42,559 --> 00:44:47,440
lucky since then i guess

1380
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:49,679
well having good practices to keep

1381
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:51,119
things out of your facility is always

1382
00:44:49,679 --> 00:44:52,318
i think the best

1383
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:54,079
the best thing

1384
00:44:52,318 --> 00:44:55,358
you can do yep

1385
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:56,400
yep you're just going to learn it the

1386
00:44:55,358 --> 00:44:58,000
hard way

1387
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,599
because before that i was like oh man

1388
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,800
these beneficials are a bunch of money

1389
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:03,599
i'm just going to make sure that i don't

1390
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:04,560
bring in any genetics and

1391
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:05,760
you know

1392
00:45:04,559 --> 00:45:08,078
i'm just going to keep my fingers

1393
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:10,400
crossed basically

1394
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:12,079
so no more no more of that for us well

1395
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:15,440
you're in a building too where there's

1396
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:16,839
other grows right or in an area right

1397
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:20,079
there's a little more

1398
00:45:16,838 --> 00:45:22,480
risk yep for sure i mean we're in a

1399
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:24,318
building with other growers and

1400
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:26,719
um you know i don't i don't think that

1401
00:45:24,318 --> 00:45:27,759
there's a high probability of

1402
00:45:26,719 --> 00:45:29,199
you know

1403
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:31,200
many bugs flying around the building and

1404
00:45:29,199 --> 00:45:32,719
flying in my door but also

1405
00:45:31,199 --> 00:45:34,639
you know like

1406
00:45:32,719 --> 00:45:36,000
our grow isn't super sophisticated we

1407
00:45:34,639 --> 00:45:37,838
you know we have doors that come into

1408
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,719
rooms and then doors go into other rooms

1409
00:45:37,838 --> 00:45:40,318
so

1410
00:45:38,719 --> 00:45:42,078
in the spring it's entirely possible

1411
00:45:40,318 --> 00:45:43,838
that we're going to have an aphid

1412
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:45,920
find its way in an open door you know

1413
00:45:43,838 --> 00:45:47,440
either on a person coming from the car

1414
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:48,960
into the building or

1415
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:53,039
just finding its way in because our

1416
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:53,039
plants smell nice or whatever you know

1417
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:57,838
so as

1418
00:45:56,159 --> 00:46:00,639
as someone who you know started this

1419
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:02,639
facility and as you know sort of evolved

1420
00:46:00,639 --> 00:46:04,480
to where you are now what are some of

1421
00:46:02,639 --> 00:46:05,679
the biggest challenges that you've

1422
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,880
experienced along the way and this

1423
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:08,399
doesn't necessarily have to be

1424
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:12,000
cultivation

1425
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,000
related in terms of an answer

1426
00:46:13,039 --> 00:46:16,800
um

1427
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,800
i mean

1428
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:23,119
i think finding good information

1429
00:46:19,838 --> 00:46:25,838
is probably the biggest challenge um

1430
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:25,838
you know it's like

1431
00:46:26,318 --> 00:46:30,480
good information on cannabis is tough to

1432
00:46:28,239 --> 00:46:31,439
find and it's an it's in a growing field

1433
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,880
you know

1434
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,400
a lot of this has been

1435
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:36,480
you know behind closed doors for a long

1436
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:37,920
time so you're just calling somebody you

1437
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,760
know or

1438
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,920
you know finding some stuff online that

1439
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:43,280
you can go from and god knows how

1440
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:44,800
accurate that is

1441
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:46,079
um so

1442
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,920
historically it's been next to

1443
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:49,839
impossible to have great information and

1444
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:52,000
now there's a lot more coming out

1445
00:46:49,838 --> 00:46:54,078
um and you know through your podcast is

1446
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,760
one of the sources honestly for me

1447
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:56,480
um

1448
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:58,079
but

1449
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,280
yeah i mean just just

1450
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:02,240
being able to get really good

1451
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:04,240
information and you know like

1452
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:06,318
like googling i mean i can't you know

1453
00:47:04,239 --> 00:47:07,519
googling leaf deficiencies you take a

1454
00:47:06,318 --> 00:47:09,358
picture of your leaf and you're sitting

1455
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:11,440
there with your iphone you know trying

1456
00:47:09,358 --> 00:47:12,880
to compare this to a picture you find

1457
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:14,800
online and it's

1458
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:16,160
you know that's it's next to impossible

1459
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,760
so when you're trying to

1460
00:47:16,159 --> 00:47:19,279
call somebody who might add a similar

1461
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:21,040
issue um

1462
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:23,440
so that's been that's been a process is

1463
00:47:21,039 --> 00:47:25,838
just getting good information you know

1464
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,838
um

1465
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,280
i think another one is um

1466
00:47:27,949 --> 00:47:31,439
[Music]

1467
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:33,599
that can of safety i mean that was like

1468
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:35,599
a that was a hard time

1469
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:36,559
um you know i wasn't sure if we were

1470
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:37,838
gonna

1471
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:39,440
make it through that because at that

1472
00:47:37,838 --> 00:47:41,759
time like you're you know you're kind of

1473
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:43,760
living cropped a crop i mean all of us

1474
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:45,520
growers know it's like

1475
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:47,520
everyone thinks we're raking in the

1476
00:47:45,519 --> 00:47:48,880
money but you know there's a lot of

1477
00:47:47,519 --> 00:47:50,480
money going through the business with

1478
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:53,920
power and rent and trying to pay

1479
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:55,920
employees and you know when you have

1480
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:57,599
a couple of crops that aren't going to

1481
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:00,318
go well i mean it's not it's not long

1482
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:02,240
before you're not paying your bills

1483
00:48:00,318 --> 00:48:03,759
so that was a that was a pretty scary

1484
00:48:02,239 --> 00:48:04,799
time because if we hadn't gotten rid of

1485
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:06,800
that thing

1486
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:08,160
you know one of my solutions was to

1487
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,880
because i was i mean i was probably

1488
00:48:08,159 --> 00:48:12,480
overreactive at the time i was you know

1489
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:14,079
really just terrified of this bug that

1490
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:15,358
supposedly wasn't on the east coast i

1491
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:17,440
didn't know anybody else out here that

1492
00:48:15,358 --> 00:48:19,039
had it and i remember justin talking

1493
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:20,639
about it and he really scared the crap

1494
00:48:19,039 --> 00:48:22,480
out of me

1495
00:48:20,639 --> 00:48:23,838
and then i remember i sent when i first

1496
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,719
got a picture of it i think i sent it to

1497
00:48:23,838 --> 00:48:25,679
you

1498
00:48:24,719 --> 00:48:26,879
um

1499
00:48:25,679 --> 00:48:28,960
because i don't think i knew suzanne at

1500
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:31,039
the time um actually that's when i met

1501
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:32,559
susan this is through the cannabis aphid

1502
00:48:31,039 --> 00:48:34,318
experience

1503
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:36,960
and then justin and justin's reply was

1504
00:48:34,318 --> 00:48:38,079
getting ready to go to war man

1505
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:39,119
um

1506
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:41,039
so

1507
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:42,800
so let's let's just touch on it i don't

1508
00:48:41,039 --> 00:48:45,119
i don't want to get too into

1509
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:47,760
into pest advice just because i

1510
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:48,720
we have suzanne who's really the the

1511
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,880
expert

1512
00:48:48,719 --> 00:48:53,759
on that yeah really the foremost expert

1513
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:56,160
on that and we do but um i know justin

1514
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:57,839
through you know some of his processes

1515
00:48:56,159 --> 00:48:59,358
is able to we're never allowed to say

1516
00:48:57,838 --> 00:49:01,119
eradicate because out of respect for

1517
00:48:59,358 --> 00:49:02,799
suzanne it's not a word that we can use

1518
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:05,519
when we're talking about pests

1519
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:07,760
but we can they have not spotted another

1520
00:49:05,519 --> 00:49:10,480
aphid in their facility in over a year

1521
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:11,680
or two now um it sounds like you're in a

1522
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:13,599
similar boat

1523
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:15,519
what what really like put the nail in

1524
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:17,280
the coffin for them

1525
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:19,920
in your facility so for us it was the

1526
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:21,760
heat treatment we we cooked the place

1527
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:23,440
um which was a

1528
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:25,520
risky move and it was a dangerous move

1529
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:27,440
but it was we only had

1530
00:49:25,519 --> 00:49:29,280
um you know we only had it in a few

1531
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:31,119
spots and i was just really scared of

1532
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:32,079
this population exploding really quickly

1533
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:33,760
and i

1534
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:35,920
you know i wasn't really sure what to do

1535
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:38,800
and i remember reading about how fast it

1536
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:40,880
can replicate and i i found one i put in

1537
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:42,880
a baggie and i went back the next day

1538
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:45,680
and there were six in there um in a

1539
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:46,720
24-hour period and i was like holy crap

1540
00:49:45,679 --> 00:49:48,239
so

1541
00:49:46,719 --> 00:49:49,039
you know that's when

1542
00:49:48,239 --> 00:49:52,639
i

1543
00:49:49,039 --> 00:49:52,639
basically panicked you know like

1544
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:56,480
suzanne wouldn't say that this was like

1545
00:49:54,159 --> 00:49:58,639
a smart thing to do um and i try not to

1546
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:00,079
tell other people like you know this is

1547
00:49:58,639 --> 00:50:02,558
what you should do because i think a lot

1548
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:04,240
of people probably can't do it but um

1549
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:06,480
you know i heated the rooms you know

1550
00:50:04,239 --> 00:50:09,519
aphids don't like heat and i cooked the

1551
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:10,400
rooms up to 120 degrees for two hours

1552
00:50:09,519 --> 00:50:12,639
um

1553
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:14,160
and you know i lost some plants and veg

1554
00:50:12,639 --> 00:50:16,318
for sure and i was in there watering the

1555
00:50:14,159 --> 00:50:18,318
whole time and thank god we had large

1556
00:50:16,318 --> 00:50:20,318
soil volumes because if you didn't have

1557
00:50:18,318 --> 00:50:21,599
if i was in pots like the the root zone

1558
00:50:20,318 --> 00:50:24,000
temperature would

1559
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:25,440
you'd kill the plants um

1560
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,559
you know when we did kill some plants in

1561
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,079
the bedroom

1562
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:29,680
but that's what i did and it worked and

1563
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:31,839
we never saw another aphid again i did

1564
00:50:29,679 --> 00:50:35,598
that and then i did a huge release of

1565
00:50:31,838 --> 00:50:36,639
the the wasp the comani and her irve or

1566
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:37,599
something

1567
00:50:36,639 --> 00:50:39,598
um

1568
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:42,079
and then you know lace wings all over

1569
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:43,760
the place so we just went full bore on

1570
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:45,839
that and then did a huge so we did the

1571
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:48,160
knock down talking with suzanne that the

1572
00:50:45,838 --> 00:50:49,119
the heat treatment was to do a knockdown

1573
00:50:48,159 --> 00:50:50,799
um

1574
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:52,400
and then the

1575
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:54,079
you know the beneficial release after

1576
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:56,079
that i never saw another eight but and

1577
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:57,200
that was i don't know a couple years ago

1578
00:50:56,079 --> 00:50:58,960
now

1579
00:50:57,199 --> 00:51:00,239
that's great yeah

1580
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:02,000
um

1581
00:51:00,239 --> 00:51:03,199
okay so i wanna i wanna change direction

1582
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,079
there's a couple questions that we

1583
00:51:03,199 --> 00:51:05,358
there's a couple things we haven't

1584
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:07,039
talked about that i think people might

1585
00:51:05,358 --> 00:51:09,119
find interesting especially if they

1586
00:51:07,039 --> 00:51:11,440
start following you on

1587
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:14,400
instagram um

1588
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:17,440
so two things one i want to talk first

1589
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:20,000
about your blue mat experience

1590
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:21,760
um because okay i think that's

1591
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,838
interesting and i think we should add

1592
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:25,200
contrarian views to you know our

1593
00:51:23,838 --> 00:51:27,358
experiences

1594
00:51:25,199 --> 00:51:29,358
as as everyone knows we're big fans of

1595
00:51:27,358 --> 00:51:31,440
blue mats i we use them in quite a few

1596
00:51:29,358 --> 00:51:33,279
commercial facilities uh justin mcgill

1597
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:35,200
who's a good friend of mine and mike

1598
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:37,680
michael knows them too

1599
00:51:35,199 --> 00:51:39,439
he uses them very successfully so you

1600
00:51:37,679 --> 00:51:42,399
bought a bunch of blue mats tell me

1601
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:44,159
about your experiences

1602
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:46,160
yeah when i first bought them um you

1603
00:51:44,159 --> 00:51:47,838
know i bought a few to try them out and

1604
00:51:46,159 --> 00:51:49,838
had really great results some of the

1605
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:52,078
best results i've ever had is on blue

1606
00:51:49,838 --> 00:51:52,880
maps to be fully transparent

1607
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:55,760
um

1608
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:57,519
and just as we've tried to

1609
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:59,119
put them out on a larger scale and i

1610
00:51:57,519 --> 00:52:00,880
don't have a large facility you know we

1611
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:02,559
have two flower rooms each one's you

1612
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:05,039
know one's like 400 square feet the

1613
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:06,160
other one's 500 square feet of canopy

1614
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:08,000
um

1615
00:52:06,159 --> 00:52:09,679
trying to get the consistency that i

1616
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:14,159
want out of the blue mats i just haven't

1617
00:52:09,679 --> 00:52:15,838
been able to accomplish it um you know

1618
00:52:14,159 --> 00:52:17,920
like my philosophically one of things i

1619
00:52:15,838 --> 00:52:18,880
don't love about the blue mass is you

1620
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:21,358
don't really know if you're

1621
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:23,358
underwatering until you see an unhappy

1622
00:52:21,358 --> 00:52:24,799
plant wilting

1623
00:52:23,358 --> 00:52:26,880
which if that happens late in flower

1624
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:27,760
that's a big deal

1625
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:29,358
or

1626
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:30,640
you have you know runoff coming out of

1627
00:52:29,358 --> 00:52:32,799
your beds and then you go to make the

1628
00:52:30,639 --> 00:52:34,558
adjustment on the um on the blue mats

1629
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:36,160
and they're just really sensitive

1630
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:37,440
so by the time you have a bed that's

1631
00:52:36,159 --> 00:52:38,879
running off

1632
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:40,559
it's probably going to keep dripping for

1633
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:41,760
another day and like we don't have

1634
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:43,760
really great

1635
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:44,559
water mitigation i put some like you

1636
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:47,040
know

1637
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:48,480
system underneath the beds to kind of

1638
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:50,558
corral the water which doesn't really

1639
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:52,318
work that well so in my older room with

1640
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:54,000
it when the beds run off it just makes a

1641
00:52:52,318 --> 00:52:55,440
mess um

1642
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,039
and also i don't like the idea of losing

1643
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:58,720
the nutrients but

1644
00:52:57,039 --> 00:53:00,800
the um

1645
00:52:58,719 --> 00:53:03,199
yeah i mean you know they tend to if you

1646
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:04,800
get like any air in there at all even if

1647
00:53:03,199 --> 00:53:06,159
you fill them up and do everything you

1648
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:07,680
set them properly

1649
00:53:06,159 --> 00:53:09,598
sometimes you get a little bit of air in

1650
00:53:07,679 --> 00:53:11,118
one and they just don't you know they

1651
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:12,960
don't work there's any air in there

1652
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:14,559
basically a cushion on it so they don't

1653
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:16,480
have the ability to

1654
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:18,319
you know the tension doesn't work its

1655
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:20,800
way through to the actual mechanism that

1656
00:53:18,318 --> 00:53:22,239
pinches the little hose um

1657
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:24,400
so we just haven't been able to get it

1658
00:53:22,239 --> 00:53:25,759
to be as consistent

1659
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:27,358
on scale

1660
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:29,280
and some of that might just be through

1661
00:53:27,358 --> 00:53:31,440
having multiple people in the facility

1662
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:32,880
if you're doing a default or a cleanup

1663
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,800
on your leaves if you bump the thing

1664
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:37,039
even if you don't twist the knob

1665
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:38,559
if the if the blue mat itself gets

1666
00:53:37,039 --> 00:53:40,480
pumped and it breaks contact with the

1667
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:42,559
soil it's gonna think the soil is dry

1668
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:44,159
because it's got air

1669
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:46,559
so we had a you know a few experiences

1670
00:53:44,159 --> 00:53:49,118
like that with runoff

1671
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:51,680
and because my facility isn't that big

1672
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:53,519
um we just hand water and you know i

1673
00:53:51,679 --> 00:53:54,558
don't think that's our forever solution

1674
00:53:53,519 --> 00:53:56,480
i don't

1675
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:58,160
you know i'm not saying everybody should

1676
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:59,920
hand water larger facilities because

1677
00:53:58,159 --> 00:54:01,279
it's a it's a pain in the butt but for

1678
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:02,639
right now it

1679
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:04,640
that seems to be working more

1680
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:06,879
consistently for us than the blue mats

1681
00:54:04,639 --> 00:54:09,679
were

1682
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:11,920
yeah so i you know uh i've heard this a

1683
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:14,480
couple times uh it's a little more rare

1684
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:16,400
but the you know it is for some people

1685
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:19,039
it just it doesn't work quite the way

1686
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:20,960
they want it to um

1687
00:54:19,039 --> 00:54:23,838
i will say i've worked with some fairly

1688
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:26,240
large facilities that are pulling it off

1689
00:54:23,838 --> 00:54:29,679
but the concerns around the air inside

1690
00:54:26,239 --> 00:54:32,078
the sensor or the air around coming in

1691
00:54:29,679 --> 00:54:33,838
contact with the sensor in the

1692
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:35,760
in the soil itself so like if there's a

1693
00:54:33,838 --> 00:54:38,400
big chunk of pumice or perlite right

1694
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:40,079
next to that sensor it could cause it to

1695
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:42,559
um

1696
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:44,240
just over over water like directions so

1697
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:46,720
yeah those are those are definite

1698
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:48,558
concerns um

1699
00:54:46,719 --> 00:54:50,719
i think if i was in a larger facility

1700
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:53,760
i'd probably be a little bit more

1701
00:54:50,719 --> 00:54:56,318
incentivized to try to figure it out

1702
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:58,559
um because the labor savings would be

1703
00:54:56,318 --> 00:54:59,759
more significant basically

1704
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:01,040
um

1705
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:03,200
and i like

1706
00:55:01,039 --> 00:55:06,480
i think if we kept going at it we would

1707
00:55:03,199 --> 00:55:08,639
eventually figure it out but um

1708
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:11,039
you know i don't know i just

1709
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:12,719
we haven't had we haven't adopted it we

1710
00:55:11,039 --> 00:55:14,159
tried it a few times and when they're

1711
00:55:12,719 --> 00:55:15,598
working they're great but there was too

1712
00:55:14,159 --> 00:55:17,679
many times where it's

1713
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:20,160
you know the nail in the coffin was we

1714
00:55:17,679 --> 00:55:22,159
had um one of them clogged from the

1715
00:55:20,159 --> 00:55:24,318
inside basically so the hose looked like

1716
00:55:22,159 --> 00:55:26,078
it was wicking water and there was

1717
00:55:24,318 --> 00:55:26,880
you know there was a we were using the

1718
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:29,599
um

1719
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:32,318
what's that white hose stuff the uh

1720
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:35,359
grip tape yeah the blue foam essentially

1721
00:55:32,318 --> 00:55:36,719
soaker hose yeah yeah so it looked like

1722
00:55:35,358 --> 00:55:38,880
it was watering

1723
00:55:36,719 --> 00:55:41,199
um and it really wasn't and we didn't

1724
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:44,240
notice it and it was like you know week

1725
00:55:41,199 --> 00:55:46,078
six and we had two beds that

1726
00:55:44,239 --> 00:55:47,759
you know just tailed off hard and

1727
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:48,880
finished really early and that's when we

1728
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:50,559
realized that they just weren't getting

1729
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:52,160
any water

1730
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:53,920
can you explain that because the way

1731
00:55:52,159 --> 00:55:55,920
they look like the water is they

1732
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:57,599
actually perspire through the hose

1733
00:55:55,920 --> 00:56:00,240
itself so you can see the droplets

1734
00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:02,720
coming out of the soaker hose

1735
00:56:00,239 --> 00:56:04,399
right yeah i think well that's so the

1736
00:56:02,719 --> 00:56:06,159
hose was i mean you know after you use

1737
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:07,200
them a few times they get pretty

1738
00:56:06,159 --> 00:56:08,239
you know

1739
00:56:07,199 --> 00:56:09,919
sturdy

1740
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:11,519
so you don't really see a droplet

1741
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:12,400
anymore you more just see a film on the

1742
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:14,400
hose

1743
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:16,798
um and i think in this case there was a

1744
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:18,160
biofilm that had sort of formed from the

1745
00:56:16,798 --> 00:56:20,318
inside so

1746
00:56:18,159 --> 00:56:22,318
there was some water coming out of them

1747
00:56:20,318 --> 00:56:24,719
in the in the the actual thing was

1748
00:56:22,318 --> 00:56:26,639
pressurized so it was like okay that

1749
00:56:24,719 --> 00:56:28,558
when you walk by you think it's watering

1750
00:56:26,639 --> 00:56:30,719
and the soil looks a little dry but you

1751
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:32,000
can see a little wetness on the on the

1752
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:34,959
um

1753
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:37,440
on the hose itself and you can you know

1754
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:38,960
it looks like it's watering

1755
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:40,639
um

1756
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:42,159
and so that was a new one we hadn't seen

1757
00:56:40,639 --> 00:56:44,400
that one before and i think that one is

1758
00:56:42,159 --> 00:56:45,920
extremely rare i i've talked to a few

1759
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,639
people about it and they they were like

1760
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:49,200
yeah

1761
00:56:46,639 --> 00:56:51,199
that's not that's not a common thing

1762
00:56:49,199 --> 00:56:52,480
um and it only happened on you know two

1763
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:55,118
of the beds that run and that was the

1764
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:57,039
only time i ever saw it but

1765
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:58,318
yeah i've never seen that but i i guess

1766
00:56:57,039 --> 00:56:59,759
i could see where that could happen we

1767
00:56:58,318 --> 00:57:02,159
always uh

1768
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:03,359
clean in between cycles the we clean the

1769
00:57:02,159 --> 00:57:04,719
blue mats

1770
00:57:03,358 --> 00:57:05,679
and and the soaker hose to make sure

1771
00:57:04,719 --> 00:57:06,959
that

1772
00:57:05,679 --> 00:57:09,279
you know it's ready to go for the next

1773
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:10,639
cycle but the other thing too that we

1774
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:12,000
typically have people doing is going

1775
00:57:10,639 --> 00:57:13,118
around with a moisture meter and just

1776
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,440
making sure

1777
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:17,280
that the beds are staying at the in the

1778
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:18,240
range that we want them to

1779
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:20,000
um

1780
00:57:18,239 --> 00:57:22,399
because like you mentioned like justin

1781
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,838
doesn't have any way of having runoff in

1782
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:27,519
his beds he literally has a little tiny

1783
00:57:24,838 --> 00:57:29,759
like i mean it's not much larger than a

1784
00:57:27,519 --> 00:57:31,759
solo cup little bucket hanging off the

1785
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:33,760
side of the beds because the way his

1786
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:36,640
facility was designed it was you know it

1787
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:38,720
was an old right chicken factory so he

1788
00:57:36,639 --> 00:57:41,440
kind of had to modify it and there's no

1789
00:57:38,719 --> 00:57:42,318
drains in the room so

1790
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:44,000
uh

1791
00:57:42,318 --> 00:57:45,519
yeah and they've had a couple floods but

1792
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,280
overall it's been it's been really

1793
00:57:45,519 --> 00:57:48,960
really positive um and worked really

1794
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:50,720
well for him so

1795
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,519
yeah i don't know i just thought i just

1796
00:57:50,719 --> 00:57:54,318
thought it'd be fun to have a little

1797
00:57:51,519 --> 00:57:56,400
discussion around it um the only other

1798
00:57:54,318 --> 00:57:59,519
thing i really wanted to touch on with

1799
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:02,559
you is uh you run bare soil you don't

1800
00:57:59,519 --> 00:58:04,960
have cover crops in there um

1801
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:06,640
explain i mean i've i know i've been

1802
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:08,960
pretty vocal about my thoughts on it but

1803
00:58:06,639 --> 00:58:11,519
what are your thoughts around running

1804
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:11,519
cover crop

1805
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:14,799
yeah i mean most of my thoughts are

1806
00:58:13,199 --> 00:58:16,318
probably from taking advice from you

1807
00:58:14,798 --> 00:58:18,239
because

1808
00:58:16,318 --> 00:58:20,159
you know as far as like learning how to

1809
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:21,679
grow in these large beds and living soil

1810
00:58:20,159 --> 00:58:23,199
like you've been the person that i've

1811
00:58:21,679 --> 00:58:24,798
talked to the most so

1812
00:58:23,199 --> 00:58:26,960
in general like i remember i was really

1813
00:58:24,798 --> 00:58:28,960
excited about doing some cover crops

1814
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:30,000
after i got the beds and

1815
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:32,639
you know

1816
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:34,239
your your advice was you know you can

1817
00:58:32,639 --> 00:58:35,440
harbor additional pests and stuff like

1818
00:58:34,239 --> 00:58:37,358
that and

1819
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:38,400
you know suzanne's always told me the

1820
00:58:37,358 --> 00:58:40,639
same thing

1821
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:43,280
and i've always had since i went to the

1822
00:58:40,639 --> 00:58:45,279
beds i've had great results with

1823
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:46,559
doing amendments the way i'm doing them

1824
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:48,240
so

1825
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:49,920
i guess my thought is a little bit you

1826
00:58:48,239 --> 00:58:52,000
know along the lines of like if it isn't

1827
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:54,079
broke don't fix it sort of thing is you

1828
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:56,960
know the results we're getting results

1829
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:58,160
that we're quite satisfied with and

1830
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:59,358
it is an additional thing that you would

1831
00:58:58,159 --> 00:59:00,960
have to manage

1832
00:58:59,358 --> 00:59:01,759
um

1833
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:03,679
and

1834
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:04,799
you know i've done some reading on cover

1835
00:59:03,679 --> 00:59:05,598
crops

1836
00:59:04,798 --> 00:59:07,679
and

1837
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:09,599
you know in indoors i'm not sure that

1838
00:59:07,679 --> 00:59:12,318
everybody's getting the the nitrogen

1839
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:13,760
cycling that they that they want and i i

1840
00:59:12,318 --> 00:59:15,599
don't really know like it's just one of

1841
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:17,040
these things that i've never i've never

1842
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:19,838
done that um

1843
00:59:17,039 --> 00:59:21,119
and i i can't remember but i was reading

1844
00:59:19,838 --> 00:59:23,440
something about somebody talking about

1845
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:25,280
doing cover crops um

1846
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:27,039
and how much nitrogen actually makes it

1847
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:28,798
back into the soil

1848
00:59:27,039 --> 00:59:29,920
through those crops and

1849
00:59:28,798 --> 00:59:32,318
um

1850
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:34,480
i think it's a lot less than and our

1851
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:36,159
people are hoping for sometimes and it

1852
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:37,679
is it's it's another it's another

1853
00:59:36,159 --> 00:59:38,879
environment that you're trying to manage

1854
00:59:37,679 --> 00:59:39,759
so

1855
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:41,440
you know

1856
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:43,280
today it's something i just haven't i

1857
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:44,240
just haven't gotten into really okay i

1858
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:46,240
thought i didn't know if you played

1859
00:59:44,239 --> 00:59:48,639
around with it um i know gold leaf did

1860
00:59:46,239 --> 00:59:49,919
and moved away from it um

1861
00:59:48,639 --> 00:59:50,719
i wasn't sure if that was something you

1862
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:53,440
would

1863
00:59:50,719 --> 00:59:56,480
ever no i at one point i was all i was

1864
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:58,798
all jazzed up to give it a whirl and um

1865
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:00,000
and then i ruined it i think

1866
00:59:58,798 --> 01:00:01,920
uh you weren't the only one i mean i

1867
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,119
talked to a few people and

1868
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:04,720
you know

1869
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:08,240
it is one of those things it's like if

1870
01:00:04,719 --> 01:00:11,439
you if things are going well um you know

1871
01:00:08,239 --> 01:00:14,959
it doesn't always make sense to

1872
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:16,639
start trying new things um so

1873
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:19,679
i i still have a curiosity about it

1874
01:00:16,639 --> 01:00:21,199
honestly uh but yeah well folks want to

1875
01:00:19,679 --> 01:00:23,759
hear maybe i'll try someday maybe i'll

1876
01:00:21,199 --> 01:00:25,679
try it again maybe i'll give it a

1877
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:28,000
give the thought process a chance again

1878
01:00:25,679 --> 01:00:30,558
now you brought it up yeah it's not it's

1879
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:32,559
not a black and white answer but i i i

1880
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:34,480
definitely fall on the side of not using

1881
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:35,920
cover crops indoors and if people want

1882
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:38,318
to read more about that i have a blog

1883
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:39,358
post that's fairly recent up there on

1884
01:00:38,318 --> 01:00:41,279
why

1885
01:00:39,358 --> 01:00:43,199
uh at least so people can read my logic

1886
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:45,040
and and then tell me i'm wrong i get

1887
01:00:43,199 --> 01:00:46,159
that a fair bit but um

1888
01:00:45,039 --> 01:00:48,480
yeah

1889
01:00:46,159 --> 01:00:49,920
i guess philosophically too it sort of

1890
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:51,199
made sense to me too because it is one

1891
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:52,159
more variable

1892
01:00:51,199 --> 01:00:54,078
and

1893
01:00:52,159 --> 01:00:55,598
you know

1894
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:56,960
i was talking with of the other night

1895
01:00:55,599 --> 01:00:58,559
and i was talking about

1896
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:00,720
you know like

1897
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:02,798
this organic growing process that really

1898
01:01:00,719 --> 01:01:04,798
has so many variables just like um you

1899
01:01:02,798 --> 01:01:06,480
were saying earlier is that like this

1900
01:01:04,798 --> 01:01:08,318
really is a puzzle that i'm really still

1901
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:11,119
working on and

1902
01:01:08,318 --> 01:01:13,599
you know yeah like

1903
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:15,119
adding this thing in or not is like if

1904
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:16,400
if i was going to try it i want to test

1905
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:17,680
it like am i going to bring this in or

1906
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:19,039
not and i'm still

1907
01:01:17,679 --> 01:01:21,118
messing with a lot of other things at

1908
01:01:19,039 --> 01:01:22,960
this point so i'm always kind of

1909
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:25,519
testing this and that and

1910
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:26,880
um you know maybe i'll get there someday

1911
01:01:25,519 --> 01:01:28,960
and it just

1912
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:29,838
hasn't made it to the forefront of what

1913
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:31,358
i've

1914
01:01:29,838 --> 01:01:33,279
tested

1915
01:01:31,358 --> 01:01:34,880
yeah and when you say testing uh you

1916
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:36,000
brought up a good point you're not just

1917
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:37,760
uh

1918
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:40,079
you're not just doing something across

1919
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:41,280
your entire facility when you say tests

1920
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:43,760
it's it's no

1921
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:45,359
that's not that's not what you do right

1922
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:47,599
yep i always kind of if i'm trying out

1923
01:01:45,358 --> 01:01:49,199
something new i bring it in and uh

1924
01:01:47,599 --> 01:01:51,200
depending on my level of confidence if

1925
01:01:49,199 --> 01:01:53,279
it's if i'm skeptical i do it on a very

1926
01:01:51,199 --> 01:01:55,038
small area and if i'm you know more

1927
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:56,640
confident i might try it on a broad area

1928
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:58,640
like the micronutrients like i wasn't

1929
01:01:56,639 --> 01:02:00,239
worried that i was going to

1930
01:01:58,639 --> 01:02:01,519
ruin the soil in half of the beds

1931
01:02:00,239 --> 01:02:03,118
because i didn't you know i didn't even

1932
01:02:01,519 --> 01:02:04,480
go for the targets i went for like half

1933
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:06,160
of the targets and

1934
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:08,719
waited for analysis so i'm kind of

1935
01:02:06,159 --> 01:02:10,558
creeping up on it um

1936
01:02:08,719 --> 01:02:13,439
but yeah i always sort of like try

1937
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:15,280
something and see if it starts making

1938
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:16,079
sense and then kind of scale up on it

1939
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:17,599
you know

1940
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:19,599
actually ben higgins the one you did

1941
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:21,599
with him i had my people listen to it i

1942
01:02:19,599 --> 01:02:22,960
was like you know i was sending the link

1943
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:24,798
to my employees like you guys got to

1944
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:26,318
listen to this this is like you know

1945
01:02:24,798 --> 01:02:28,318
this is how i think and that's how i

1946
01:02:26,318 --> 01:02:29,440
want you guys to think his process of

1947
01:02:28,318 --> 01:02:31,358
you know basically bringing the

1948
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:32,960
scientific process into the

1949
01:02:31,358 --> 01:02:34,639
into cultivation it's definitely like

1950
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:36,880
how my brain works and to have someone

1951
01:02:34,639 --> 01:02:38,719
like really talk about it the way he did

1952
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:39,599
was like really clearly so

1953
01:02:38,719 --> 01:02:42,000
um

1954
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:43,039
you know i have the same mindset i do a

1955
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,760
lot of

1956
01:02:43,039 --> 01:02:48,400
um you know if i if i have a hypothesis

1957
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:50,799
on how something might be better or

1958
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:52,160
uh you know to get rid of a problem i

1959
01:02:50,798 --> 01:02:55,038
come up with an idea of how i'm going to

1960
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:56,480
test that thing and then prove it out

1961
01:02:55,039 --> 01:02:58,400
awesome yeah and i like the idea that

1962
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:00,318
you started with half of your

1963
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:01,760
what you thought might be your target

1964
01:03:00,318 --> 01:03:03,759
just to make sure you weren't overdoing

1965
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:05,119
it because you can always add more and a

1966
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:06,880
lot of people i think yeah a little

1967
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:09,519
carried away on that side of things so

1968
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:11,200
that's and i have found um

1969
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:13,679
yeah on the micronutrients like the

1970
01:03:11,199 --> 01:03:15,358
copper um

1971
01:03:13,679 --> 01:03:16,639
when i've added that it's basically just

1972
01:03:15,358 --> 01:03:17,838
stayed and that's one of the things

1973
01:03:16,639 --> 01:03:20,000
that's given me someone else some

1974
01:03:17,838 --> 01:03:21,358
confidence in analysis as i can see that

1975
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:24,159
copper and the beds that i've added it

1976
01:03:21,358 --> 01:03:24,960
to in a way that really does make sense

1977
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:26,399
um

1978
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:28,240
and then the other ones like manganese

1979
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:29,519
like i've added manganese and it just it

1980
01:03:28,239 --> 01:03:31,519
disappears

1981
01:03:29,519 --> 01:03:32,798
um so that's when i can see that the

1982
01:03:31,519 --> 01:03:34,880
plants are actually uptaking that

1983
01:03:32,798 --> 01:03:36,960
manganese whereas the copper sort of

1984
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:39,680
just stays in that bed so if you add too

1985
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:41,199
much copper like you're probably screwed

1986
01:03:39,679 --> 01:03:42,480
um

1987
01:03:41,199 --> 01:03:44,399
that's kind of

1988
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:45,838
but i've seen manganese really i don't

1989
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:47,519
know if it's leaching out like if we're

1990
01:03:45,838 --> 01:03:49,038
having some runoff or if the plants were

1991
01:03:47,519 --> 01:03:50,960
up taking it but i suspect the plants

1992
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:52,799
are actually uptaking it because we had

1993
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:54,400
in those older beds there was virtually

1994
01:03:52,798 --> 01:03:55,759
no manganese

1995
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:59,200
yeah i'd be a little cautious with it

1996
01:03:55,760 --> 01:04:01,200
because i think um it was sam hoffler

1997
01:03:59,199 --> 01:04:05,439
from proof who did some experimentation

1998
01:04:01,199 --> 01:04:07,199
and he does tissue testing along with um

1999
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:08,400
the soil testing and he does it on a

2000
01:04:07,199 --> 01:04:11,358
whole another level

2001
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:12,559
no one's doing as many tests as he is uh

2002
01:04:11,358 --> 01:04:14,639
and

2003
01:04:12,559 --> 01:04:17,920
graphing them and figuring out what each

2004
01:04:14,639 --> 01:04:19,199
analyte is is really amazing um

2005
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:21,039
what he's doing is really state of the

2006
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:21,919
art i got to he gave me a quick little

2007
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:24,400
tour

2008
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:25,920
uh video shot of what he does and one of

2009
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:28,079
the things they found was that when they

2010
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:30,000
were adding manganese they actually

2011
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:31,839
started to cease and toxicities they got

2012
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,960
in trouble with it because it was being

2013
01:04:31,838 --> 01:04:33,920
taken up

2014
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:36,400
um

2015
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:37,680
so dramatically by the plant so

2016
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:40,160
um

2017
01:04:37,679 --> 01:04:42,078
it would keep an eye on yeah yeah just

2018
01:04:40,159 --> 01:04:43,920
just watch that and be careful because

2019
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:45,440
um

2020
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:46,720
you know tissue testing is really how we

2021
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:48,880
figure out what's

2022
01:04:46,719 --> 01:04:50,318
actually making it into the plants um

2023
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:51,760
the soil testing we're just making

2024
01:04:50,318 --> 01:04:53,599
assumptions that you know the amount of

2025
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:55,760
biology that we have yeah these

2026
01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:57,760
nutrients are coming available

2027
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:59,119
whereas the tissue testing is a little

2028
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:01,039
more accurate in that regard but i

2029
01:04:59,119 --> 01:05:03,920
actually don't do a ton of tissue

2030
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:05,440
testing but that one i did

2031
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:06,639
and that's one of the reasons that i was

2032
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:08,318
really convinced to go after the

2033
01:05:06,639 --> 01:05:09,440
micronutrients too because in the tissue

2034
01:05:08,318 --> 01:05:11,119
testing

2035
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:13,200
um they were

2036
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:15,358
basically non-detectable there was like

2037
01:05:13,199 --> 01:05:16,798
three or four maybe five micronutrients

2038
01:05:15,358 --> 01:05:18,558
that were just like

2039
01:05:16,798 --> 01:05:20,000
and and i don't know like they give you

2040
01:05:18,559 --> 01:05:21,359
these reference ranges and it's like

2041
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,960
okay like how much you're supposed to

2042
01:05:21,358 --> 01:05:24,639
have in there and

2043
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:26,318
um but there was a few that was like

2044
01:05:24,639 --> 01:05:29,118
okay no matter what the reference joint

2045
01:05:26,318 --> 01:05:30,558
this is like non-detectable levels here

2046
01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:33,680
um

2047
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:36,400
so and manganese was one of them

2048
01:05:33,679 --> 01:05:37,838
oh that's really interesting well i know

2049
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:39,280
we've been chatting for a while is there

2050
01:05:37,838 --> 01:05:41,358
any last

2051
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:43,760
you know advice or whether on the

2052
01:05:41,358 --> 01:05:47,519
business side or on the cultivation side

2053
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:50,520
um that you'd like to share with folks

2054
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:50,519
um

2055
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:56,000
yeah i guess i mean one of the

2056
01:05:54,079 --> 01:05:57,680
yeah i mean just be just be ready for

2057
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:00,159
some failures

2058
01:05:57,679 --> 01:06:01,358
um you know even just like about a month

2059
01:06:00,159 --> 01:06:03,358
ago

2060
01:06:01,358 --> 01:06:05,199
um one of my employees said to me you

2061
01:06:03,358 --> 01:06:06,719
know it's a good thing i have a

2062
01:06:05,199 --> 01:06:07,919
i think what he said he goes a good

2063
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:10,719
thing you have a really healthy

2064
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:12,480
relationship with failure um you know we

2065
01:06:10,719 --> 01:06:14,480
were redoing some of the

2066
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:17,838
drainage system in a couple of the beds

2067
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:19,280
and um you know there was a clog and so

2068
01:06:17,838 --> 01:06:20,960
the beds just filled up with water

2069
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:22,160
luckily there weren't any plants in them

2070
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:24,240
at the time we were doing a little bit

2071
01:06:22,159 --> 01:06:25,519
of a flush to get some sodium and

2072
01:06:24,239 --> 01:06:27,279
chloride down

2073
01:06:25,519 --> 01:06:29,280
and um

2074
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:31,599
so we had to basically activate these

2075
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:33,359
beds and it was just like this soup

2076
01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:34,240
uh and this whole thing we had spent a

2077
01:06:33,358 --> 01:06:35,838
week

2078
01:06:34,239 --> 01:06:37,439
taking out these three yards of soil

2079
01:06:35,838 --> 01:06:38,318
from these two different beds putting in

2080
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:40,318
this

2081
01:06:38,318 --> 01:06:41,599
you know drainage pipe and all this to

2082
01:06:40,318 --> 01:06:44,239
try to be able to collect the water in

2083
01:06:41,599 --> 01:06:46,079
one location and we refilled everything

2084
01:06:44,239 --> 01:06:48,159
and then we had to basically take it all

2085
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:49,280
apart again and it was a mess

2086
01:06:48,159 --> 01:06:50,558
and um

2087
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:53,119
you know stuff like that just happens

2088
01:06:50,559 --> 01:06:54,559
all the time to everybody so it's like

2089
01:06:53,119 --> 01:06:56,240
you know

2090
01:06:54,559 --> 01:06:58,240
i don't know it's

2091
01:06:56,239 --> 01:07:00,318
it's there's just a lot of failure

2092
01:06:58,239 --> 01:07:02,318
involved in it there's a lot of you know

2093
01:07:00,318 --> 01:07:03,679
you think something's kind of it doesn't

2094
01:07:02,318 --> 01:07:05,838
or you didn't even know something was

2095
01:07:03,679 --> 01:07:07,358
gonna bite you and then it does

2096
01:07:05,838 --> 01:07:10,318
um so it's just a lot of a lot of

2097
01:07:07,358 --> 01:07:12,000
resilience and and knowing that like

2098
01:07:10,318 --> 01:07:13,199
you know just because something goes

2099
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,039
wrong it's probably gone wrong for

2100
01:07:13,199 --> 01:07:18,480
everybody else too so if you

2101
01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:19,839
can you know muster the energy to try to

2102
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:21,280
figure it out and call some people you

2103
01:07:19,838 --> 01:07:22,960
can usually get through it if you just

2104
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:24,400
like decide i'm gonna solve this i'm

2105
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:25,599
gonna get through this

2106
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:26,960
and

2107
01:07:25,599 --> 01:07:28,240
you know that's one thing that's been

2108
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:29,760
really tough about being a small

2109
01:07:28,239 --> 01:07:31,358
business owner it's not it's not even

2110
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:33,440
always cultivation

2111
01:07:31,358 --> 01:07:34,880
it's you know packaging shipments it's

2112
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:36,960
the whole thing you know

2113
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:38,240
um so just

2114
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:40,480
you know have a healthy relationship

2115
01:07:38,239 --> 01:07:42,558
with failure

2116
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:44,240
yeah i think you've done a good job of

2117
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:48,160
creating a sort of a community around

2118
01:07:44,239 --> 01:07:50,399
you of resources and then also um

2119
01:07:48,159 --> 01:07:51,279
building a good brand to where

2120
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:54,318
you know

2121
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:55,680
consumers know what

2122
01:07:54,318 --> 01:07:57,279
what to expect when they walk in the

2123
01:07:55,679 --> 01:07:59,759
store and see you know main craft

2124
01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:01,280
cannabis and uh

2125
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:03,119
you know generating that interest on the

2126
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:04,720
brand side i think is is

2127
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:06,798
equally as important as growing a high

2128
01:08:04,719 --> 01:08:07,598
quality product

2129
01:08:06,798 --> 01:08:09,358
yeah

2130
01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:11,838
yeah and i have to give my wife emily

2131
01:08:09,358 --> 01:08:13,199
credit for all of that you know um when

2132
01:08:11,838 --> 01:08:14,558
we were

2133
01:08:13,199 --> 01:08:15,358
first getting going with all that she

2134
01:08:14,559 --> 01:08:17,199
really

2135
01:08:15,358 --> 01:08:19,119
she's pushed me a lot to

2136
01:08:17,198 --> 01:08:20,960
you know share stuff on instagram and

2137
01:08:19,119 --> 01:08:23,039
even to do podcasts like this like you

2138
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:25,520
know this isn't my comfort zone you

2139
01:08:23,039 --> 01:08:27,439
probably know that too but um

2140
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:28,319
you know it's always for me it's always

2141
01:08:27,439 --> 01:08:31,759
been

2142
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:33,440
i'm willing to do it because

2143
01:08:31,759 --> 01:08:34,880
the former me would still like to hear

2144
01:08:33,439 --> 01:08:37,039
what the current me has to say even

2145
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:40,079
though i don't know everything

2146
01:08:37,039 --> 01:08:42,640
and then that transparency has really

2147
01:08:40,079 --> 01:08:45,679
you know i think it's built a lot of um

2148
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:47,679
trust in in our industry with our brand

2149
01:08:45,679 --> 01:08:49,600
and it's really paid off and emily's one

2150
01:08:47,679 --> 01:08:51,279
who's pushed me to do that because no

2151
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:53,759
one really wants to make a video about

2152
01:08:51,279 --> 01:08:54,799
their aphid problems um

2153
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:56,399
but

2154
01:08:54,798 --> 01:08:58,079
you know

2155
01:08:56,399 --> 01:08:59,920
the me who was newer would have been so

2156
01:08:58,079 --> 01:09:01,519
happy to find the video of the current

2157
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:03,359
me with my aphid problem saying how i

2158
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:05,279
solved it even if it's not

2159
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:07,120
exactly what i'm going to do so

2160
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:08,400
um you know

2161
01:09:07,119 --> 01:09:09,759
that

2162
01:09:08,399 --> 01:09:12,399
the work she's done on creating the

2163
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:13,838
brand is yeah it's it's especially the

2164
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:15,278
way the market is going in maine right

2165
01:09:13,838 --> 01:09:17,119
now like having

2166
01:09:15,279 --> 01:09:20,239
having people that can identify your

2167
01:09:17,119 --> 01:09:23,278
product is is really paid off um quite a

2168
01:09:20,238 --> 01:09:26,399
bit and and that's really through the

2169
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:27,839
communications she's forced me to make

2170
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:29,838
and her own communication through it as

2171
01:09:27,838 --> 01:09:31,519
well obviously

2172
01:09:29,838 --> 01:09:34,318
yeah i know she's gotten really into the

2173
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:35,839
chocolate side of things too and using

2174
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:38,640
you know premium ingredients and

2175
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:41,039
processes to make a really high quality

2176
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:42,880
product for consumers yeah

2177
01:09:41,039 --> 01:09:45,600
yeah i mean our goal in general is to

2178
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:47,920
try to whenever we do something to

2179
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:49,920
do it the best we can so we don't have

2180
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:51,600
like a really wide product line we kind

2181
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:52,798
of figure the things that we make really

2182
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:54,480
well and

2183
01:09:52,798 --> 01:09:56,880
um that we can specialize in and then we

2184
01:09:54,479 --> 01:09:58,158
just sort of focus on that and that's

2185
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:59,679
you know definitely something emily's

2186
01:09:58,158 --> 01:10:01,599
brought to the table as well i'm usually

2187
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:02,960
more quick to be like hey we should get

2188
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:05,280
into this product this looks really fun

2189
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:06,880
other people are doing this um and you

2190
01:10:05,279 --> 01:10:08,399
know shows how to refocus me and be like

2191
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:09,760
we don't need to do everything just you

2192
01:10:08,399 --> 01:10:11,679
know let's pick the things that we can

2193
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:12,560
do well and just nail those

2194
01:10:11,679 --> 01:10:15,119
which

2195
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:16,880
makes a lot of sense

01:10:15,119 --> 01:10:18,800
