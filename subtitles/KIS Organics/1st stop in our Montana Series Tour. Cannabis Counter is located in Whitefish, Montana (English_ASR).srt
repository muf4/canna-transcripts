1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:08,240
[Music]

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,400
all right so I'm at hasco Creek Farms in

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,320
White Fish Montana with one of the

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,679
owners Craig

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:19,079
mcvine uh get a tour of the cultivation

6
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:21,160
facility which is over in this area just

7
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:22,799
toward that and the extraction stuff and

8
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:25,599
then this is the main store but what

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,800
they're doing here is really unique and

10
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:31,960
uh yeah I'm excited to share it with you

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,960
guys so Craig welcome yeah yeah

12
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:40,479
then this is clone Island yeah and we

13
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,120
what do you call it the Clone Lounge

14
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:44,959
yeah and we were we wanted a little more

15
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:47,839
humid in here so we kind of like tuck it

16
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,198
in and that the aeroponics keep the

17
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,960
humidity higher nice as long as we close

18
00:00:50,198 --> 00:00:56,479
it off which they seem to do better our

19
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,920
our propagation ratio is pretty I mean

20
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:01,358
now that it's the humidity is up it's

21
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,359
like 90%

22
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,359
95%

23
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:14,559
okay so and then

24
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:19,320
we we always address everything from

25
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:22,960
like youngest oldest so um we

26
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:27,158
transplanted this room 3 days ago three

27
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:27,158
days okay so we're still in veg in

28
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:33,040
here um there just kind of bouncing

29
00:01:33,078 --> 00:01:41,959
in wow you go from an old barn to some

30
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:41,959
ra seriously upgraded Tech here

31
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:48,719
yeah so people are going to ask these

32
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:51,118
are pip rocks pip pip shelving these are

33
00:01:48,718 --> 00:01:54,118
vas vertical airf flow

34
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:58,078
Solutions um we run

35
00:01:54,118 --> 00:01:59,920
CO2 from a big 750 tank right into these

36
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:02,718
the fan pumps it so it just kind of kind

37
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,840
of rain CO2 down on top of the

38
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:07,478
plants

39
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:10,280
um and then yeah it's all living soil on

40
00:02:07,478 --> 00:02:13,080
pip shelving and then we run blue mat

41
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:16,439
systems so kiss soil blue mat systems

42
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,959
and then these are the BIOS lights y

43
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:22,120
yeah they have a new light out they do

44
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:26,640
it's very similar but like lighter yeah

45
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:29,239
the mhm this is the uh ti2 I oh and you

46
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:31,759
guys also label your beds like this a

47
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:31,759
little

48
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,639
yeah we label the beds and then we um

49
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,640
run everything through a troll

50
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:46,000
master and then in the in the Next Room

51
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:48,000
we'll go upstairs the next room's uh in

52
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,800
like week four so it's a little it's a

53
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,400
little bigger we'll put the shelves in

54
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:56,800
the next one and go upstairs so you can

55
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:59,239
see it from from above okay great and

56
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,879
then uh this is how you guys using

57
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:04,360
scaffolding the access stuff yeah the

58
00:03:01,878 --> 00:03:06,439
scaffolding goes right between

59
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,920
these and then you can move these

60
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:11,439
shelves you just unlock

61
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:12,280
them so you can work on whatever side

62
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:15,719
you

63
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:17,799
want so for you guys the limitation was

64
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:19,519
space square footage and space so you

65
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:21,239
really needed to go vertical yep we

66
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,439
needed to go vertical and and in the

67
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:27,959
beginning we were limited

68
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:30,199
on the uh the state of Montana measures

69
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:33,199
your canopy space

70
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:34,158
and they don't care like they'll measure

71
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:36,878
this as

72
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:39,560
canopy so if we push everything together

73
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:42,280
we can limit our canopy space so we can

74
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:46,199
like basically fit more now we have

75
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:48,400
10,000 ft canopy space so it's plenty

76
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:51,158
but in the beginning we had a th000 so

77
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,200
we had to like cram everything together

78
00:03:51,158 --> 00:03:57,158
got it that makes

79
00:03:53,199 --> 00:04:00,560
sense got going is like we measure we

80
00:03:57,158 --> 00:04:03,318
try to keep 1.2 to 1.4 VPD

81
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,000
in these rooms and it's like I think one

82
00:04:03,318 --> 00:04:07,119
of the nicest things about this grow is

83
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,639
that these rooms are like they never see

84
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,959
outside of 1.2 or

85
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:13,798
1.4d and so what are the big factors

86
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:16,280
there in controlling the environment for

87
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:18,239
you uh humidity and temperature

88
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:20,798
basically and then matching that as we

89
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:23,679
drop as we drop temperature we we drop

90
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:25,279
humidity and and you that all through uh

91
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,439
this troll Master controller yeah it all

92
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:32,638
runs through this how do you like the

93
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:32,639
hydro X Plus I like it

94
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:39,319
um it it works well we also we it's a

95
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:42,038
great system for controlling everything

96
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:45,240
but we use a pulse to monitor everything

97
00:04:42,038 --> 00:04:48,159
oh okay to see um to basically to double

98
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:50,680
check everything that's a good idea yeah

99
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,680
all right

100
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,600
cool pretty easy we

101
00:04:55,100 --> 00:05:00,759
[Applause]

102
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:03,600
can so then this is our

103
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:03,600
other flower

104
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:14,680
room oh do you want me to close the door

105
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,680
uh yeah let's close it grab it

106
00:05:16,038 --> 00:05:21,079
okay and

107
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:23,038
then so we're a little later in flower

108
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:27,800
in here I think we're just just started

109
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:30,159
week five okay and then we can go

110
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,600
up are you going to run it another round

111
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,720
of trellis netting on

112
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:38,560
this or how do you guys typically finish

113
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:40,520
we generally at this point we probably

114
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,600
won't this is probably the cut off on

115
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:46,240
where we would have we might have to put

116
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:50,000
some stakes in like we rent two on that

117
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:53,519
one um so it just depends on the height

118
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,918
so it's I

119
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:58,758
would I would say we probably should

120
00:05:55,918 --> 00:06:00,318
have ran another round of trellis but at

121
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:02,160
this point it might be be it might be a

122
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:05,319
little bit

123
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,319
late got

124
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:12,400
it oh that just slides in yeah these

125
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,720
just slide in and then they we go up

126
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:16,598
there it's so it's not so bad then

127
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:20,759
having that second level that you're

128
00:06:16,598 --> 00:06:22,719
working uh no once you get these

129
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:27,160
in

130
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,160
um it's really easy to work up

131
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:33,280
there you just have to think about what

132
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:34,639
what your move is up there cuz once you

133
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:36,318
know you don't want to put it in and

134
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:40,199
then need to go to the other side right

135
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:42,039
away yeah so the soil's not leaving do

136
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:43,639
you just pass the plants up or put them

137
00:06:42,038 --> 00:06:45,680
all up there when you go to transplant

138
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:47,560
and then Harvest like pass them down so

139
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,240
yeah yeah we just put them all we put

140
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,360
all the plants in a bin put it up here

141
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,960
and then transplant them up and then

142
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,960
when we Harvest we just same thing

143
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:59,038
someone stays down someone goes up and

144
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:01,000
we just pass them down is there issue

145
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:03,959
with the a lot of like dirt or dust

146
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,959
coming down onto the lower level when

147
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:09,159
you not at all not at all um or do you

148
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:11,878
always harvest the bottom first we

149
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:15,360
always harvest the bottom first yeah and

150
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:16,879
we don't really when we Harvest we don't

151
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,879
we don't pull the roots out or anything

152
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:22,360
so no dirt comes out during Harvest we

153
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:24,840
just cut the plants out okay um and then

154
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:27,840
we pull we do pull Roots but we pull

155
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:30,079
Roots like once everything's all done

156
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:33,000
then we pull roots

157
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:36,279
here we can go up here it's all

158
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:40,038
right watch your head

159
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:42,719
oh yeah they don't make this right here

160
00:07:40,038 --> 00:07:42,719
taller big

161
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:56,719
people oh this is a cool view yeah it's

162
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,800
it's so this is the second level but

163
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,199
it's it's you're you're like right here

164
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,120
so it's not not yeah it's a good working

165
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,800
height yeah yeah and you can adjust the

166
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,918
Heights on these shelves all you want

167
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,918
it's pretty easy we just keep it here

168
00:08:06,918 --> 00:08:09,918
cuz it's about good for

169
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:16,079
everybody and then we go back we we're

170
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:17,439
kind of still trying to find The Sweet

171
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:21,918
Spot of how

172
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:25,319
many how many plants per bed we run

173
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:28,240
anywhere from 5 to 5 to

174
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:31,720
11 a lot of it's cultivar

175
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,200
specific okay um what we're what we're

176
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:35,719
finding but now we're doing a lot of

177
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,360
work to figure out exactly like is it

178
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:41,719
five is it six is it 7 what's what's the

179
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:44,879
magic number to Just maximize your

180
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:47,879
canopy as quickly as possible

181
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:47,879
yeah

182
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:52,039
makesense

183
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:03,000
cool our original room we're not on um

184
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:06,120
vertical racks yet okay this is how we

185
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,360
this is how we first started with kiss

186
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:12,039
soil um we made these beds that we can

187
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,278
roll around put them on pallets so we

188
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:16,360
had some

189
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:18,919
drainage um and then these are our

190
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,200
original lights too which we will be

191
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:23,000
upgrading this

192
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,920
room uh probably this winter and then

193
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,399
this will end up being our biggest

194
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:29,799
room um in this facility we have all the

195
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,600
racks and everything

196
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:34,319
it's actually a matter of trying to time

197
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:38,000
it out cuz we're going to have to reduce

198
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:40,879
production for couple months to scale

199
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,799
this room up okay and one of the things

200
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:46,360
we were talking about that this is

201
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:48,479
probably a great example of is when you

202
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:50,759
so all of these beds were treated the

203
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,639
same the exact same and so you have

204
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:54,480
cultivars that are reacting very

205
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:55,879
differently y assuming you know we're

206
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,879
making the assumption that the nutrient

207
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:59,120
level is going to be the same across all

208
00:09:57,879 --> 00:10:01,278
these beds they're all getting a

209
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,039
approximately yeah approximately all the

210
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:06,360
same but then you have different

211
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:09,120
cultivars doing basically taking up

212
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,360
different nutrients yeah like this one

213
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,959
yeah looks great doesn't need any

214
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,839
nitrogen y dark green if anything I

215
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:15,838
would have you know room like this I

216
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:18,120
would have said oh this is getting a

217
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:21,360
little too much nitrogen but then you go

218
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:23,159
over here and we're lacking nitrogen

219
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,200
have a a mobile nutrient deficiency

220
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:28,159
going on with nitrogen

221
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,959
so uh this is where and Craig and I are

222
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:31,360
having discussion about this today with

223
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:32,679
Terry their head grower about how do we

224
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,919
address these things because we only

225
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:37,278
want to do one soil test for this room

226
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:39,078
so we want to keep the soil relatively

227
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:40,639
the same not get too caught up on what

228
00:10:39,078 --> 00:10:41,838
the soil test is you know at the end of

229
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:44,600
day we want let the plants tell us

230
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:47,360
what's going on but make sure that we're

231
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:50,680
optimizing Health across all of these

232
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:52,759
genetics so um moving forward you and I

233
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:54,958
talked about doing some you know light

234
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:57,360
nutrient things for the beds that are

235
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:59,638
maybe needing needing nutrients but

236
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,680
without changing the Dynamic of the

237
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:05,680
whole room yeah yeah so that's so that

238
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:08,759
we can amend all together and not run 30

239
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:09,958
soil tests to do it yeah and that's the

240
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:11,120
that's sort of the next step and the

241
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:13,319
other thing that we talked about that I

242
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,600
think is really interesting is just at

243
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,360
first eliminating a lot of the

244
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:21,120
variability so starting out with just

245
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,440
water you know not doing all the other

246
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,360
amending things so you can get a

247
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:27,600
Baseline and then from there really

248
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:30,959
improving and adding things uh as

249
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,959
needed but uh

250
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:38,240
yeah so this room's getting an upgrade

251
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:40,000
soon in terms of lighting and yep we'll

252
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,440
we'll probably put those new bios lights

253
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,839
in we we've got the the PIP shelves

254
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:47,639
already ready the vertical air flow

255
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:49,079
systems are ready we just need to um we

256
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:52,519
have to get everything out cuz we've got

257
00:11:49,078 --> 00:11:56,278
a the one thing with the mobile racks is

258
00:11:52,519 --> 00:12:00,519
the floor has to be completely

259
00:11:56,278 --> 00:12:03,120
perfect oh so yep any like any variation

260
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:04,879
in the floor has got to get filled in so

261
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,399
we'll fill the floor in with epoxy and

262
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:08,600
raise it up like I don't know quarter of

263
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:13,000
an inch

264
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:13,000
probably the concrete settled

265
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:20,919
so cool thank you and then this is a

266
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,199
good room to to talk in because there's

267
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:25,439
so much going on in here that's

268
00:12:23,198 --> 00:12:27,278
different like there's different there's

269
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,600
different there's really healthy looking

270
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:30,879
plants there's some that clearly need

271
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:33,320
nit nen if you go back there there's

272
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:35,320
some necrosis on the outer leaves and

273
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:38,079
they look like they need nitrogen so

274
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:40,560
it's kind of a fun one to dive into a

275
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:43,278
bit yeah we'll spend and every bed in

276
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:45,078
theory started out exactly the same

277
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:48,360
approximately the exact same

278
00:12:45,078 --> 00:12:50,479
yeah yeah so we're going to um just for

279
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:53,879
people who are curious we're going to do

280
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:57,440
uh solary pH test see what that's at

281
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:59,600
take a look at the water and um check

282
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,880
the moisture level in the beds

283
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,879
and then uh come up with a plan from

284
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:04,879
there yeah

285
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:17,360
perfect um so this is where we wash and

286
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,360
process our

287
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,959
hash

288
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,480
um we basically freeze freeze fresh

289
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:26,599
frozen in

290
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:29,759
here and then these guys take it in

291
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:32,040
there turn it into hash and then freeze

292
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:32,039
dry

293
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:39,439
it here come in here cuz we keep it cold

294
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:40,679
party in here how's it going guys what's

295
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,480
going

296
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:46,319
on how you doing this is Tad this is

297
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:49,159
Zach and Tony nice to meet you

298
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,680
guys last night what what are we washing

299
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:55,639
right now this is the melted strawberry

300
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:57,278
nice which right on tested almost 40% we

301
00:13:55,639 --> 00:14:00,278
did this is the fourth wash and we're

302
00:13:57,278 --> 00:14:02,600
getting to you know not going to be um

303
00:14:00,278 --> 00:14:05,198
but I'll show you what the first pole

304
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:08,560
looked like how we doing guys doing good

305
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:10,639
sir yeah this is the first pull off of

306
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:12,559
it so kind of compare the two right

307
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,720
there um

308
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:20,838
so

309
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:23,440
yeah nice yeah um and then the uh yeah

310
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:26,600
this melted strawberry really nice

311
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:29,320
stuff probably yielding I would guess

312
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:31,199
this is second and third P too I'm

313
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:33,519
probably going to get like probably 5%

314
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:35,439
yields but if I had to guess where we're

315
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,720
at what I think we're going to get quite

316
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:40,079
a limit

317
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:42,120
fat yeah Li fat man was 6 and half%

318
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:45,120
that's crazy it was that's awesome

319
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,120
really we have

320
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:57,959
like 585 G of cart has which most of

321
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:59,439
that is like Primo it's going to be such

322
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:04,319
good C it's going to be so full of

323
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:05,839
Turing um but you know 70 70% three I

324
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09,879
mean there should be

325
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:13,360
like there should be like six or 600 700

326
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:15,720
cards wow sweet something like that um

327
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,399
maybe maybe a little bit less depends on

328
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:20,800
of that depends on how the Press goes we

329
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:24,679
don't blow anything out things like that

330
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:26,519
right on cool yeah thanks for little

331
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:29,278
humble little lab we got the AC unit and

332
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:31,440
the cool B back there keep a cold

333
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:33,240
um fill this water tank up I like to

334
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,720
fill it up days before washing that way

335
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:37,759
ites to get down like 40° before we even

336
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:39,199
start and then we've got that bucket

337
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:42,120
filled with ice pretty much and we're

338
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:44,479
sort of cying water through the through

339
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:46,959
the chiller and then into here and so

340
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:50,039
it's pretty pretty good little setup

341
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:54,318
pumping out the pump the waste water out

342
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:56,439
the out the wall there nice yeah very

343
00:15:54,318 --> 00:15:59,360
cool well thanks guys yeah man

344
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:02,720
absolutely this is your o helps grow

345
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,720
some fire fire

346
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:07,799
Le right

347
00:16:10,318 --> 00:16:17,318
on but it's kind of an

348
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,319
interesting way we do it so we take

349
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:21,198
these we roll the so we keep this room

350
00:16:20,318 --> 00:16:26,639
at

351
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:28,719
60° fenhe 60% humidity okay um to get a

352
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:31,079
nice slow cure on it but these we just

353
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,319
roll these right into the

354
00:16:31,078 --> 00:16:35,120
um right into the grow room and then we

355
00:16:33,318 --> 00:16:37,838
can fill them up there and

356
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,919
then roll them back right into here so

357
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:42,079
we

358
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:43,439
can kind of do like full full shelves at

359
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:46,239
a time

360
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:49,120
basically

361
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:51,440
um yeah these are about dry not quite

362
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,440
done

363
00:16:53,360 --> 00:17:01,440
yet very

364
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:03,120
cool and then these these old uh reefer

365
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,640
shipping containers are awesome because

366
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,640
they're like super easy to climate

367
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,559
control so you don't have issue with

368
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,880
condensation or anything like that no we

369
00:17:08,558 --> 00:17:12,759
run a de we run a dehumidifier so we get

370
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,160
that we um you're able to maintain it

371
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:18,000
even we keep crazy Montana weather yeah

372
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:19,600
keep it exactly at 60 60 between that

373
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,400
that mini split in the back that

374
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:24,759
dehumidifier and then this humidifier

375
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:27,120
it's like almost always it's within

376
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:32,119
within less than like about a percent of

377
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:32,119
60° f 60% humidity okay

378
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:41,400
cool on that tray in there that you just

379
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:43,720
saw the uh the food grade the the the

380
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:45,038
darker green food grade stuff that we

381
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,360
don't really spend near as much time

382
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:49,599
watching because we're going to decarbon

383
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:51,519
put it into gummies anyway it ends up

384
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:54,199
becoming truthfully the most valuable

385
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:56,759
pch in that lab by the time we put it

386
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:59,759
into these gummies because of how many

387
00:17:56,759 --> 00:18:02,558
cans of gummies in one wash can make

388
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:05,798
okay you guys use uh some unique

389
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:09,599
ingredients yeah versus the standard

390
00:18:05,798 --> 00:18:12,839
indan uh GMO free glutenfree all the

391
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:16,399
keto all the things uh but yeah organic

392
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:19,279
tapioca syrup organic uh organic sugar

393
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:23,120
organic color uh

394
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:25,960
use products like juice concentrate to

395
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:28,439
color it um so it's like organic berries

396
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:30,038
have made this juice concentrate and

397
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:33,240
absolutely use so we trying to keep

398
00:18:30,038 --> 00:18:36,359
everything kind of natural um I found a

399
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:38,798
plantbased uh extract um from this

400
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:41,079
company in Berkeley that we use for a

401
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:42,960
preservative um which we went from

402
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:44,359
having mold problems in the very very

403
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,480
beginning of like trying to figure out

404
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:47,678
if they're going to be shelf stable or

405
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,038
not to not having mold problems

406
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,759
overnight when we start using that

407
00:18:49,038 --> 00:18:54,759
product it's amazing and it's 100% plat

408
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:57,279
extract super and then you guys add

409
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:59,079
herbs oh for for one of our gummy lines

410
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:02,558
yeah we have some herbs in adaptogens in

411
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:04,359
there to enhance the AM PM sort of

412
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:07,119
feeling that we're going for in that so

413
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:08,918
like the PM will have uh camomile and

414
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:12,798
skull cap and things like that and in

415
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:15,120
the daytime might have Rola and um other

416
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:20,038
upper I haven't made those in a while so

417
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:22,839
which yeah so yeah cool well since I

418
00:19:20,038 --> 00:19:24,038
have you um can you tell me I mean we'll

419
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:27,038
go check it out but can you tell me

420
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:29,359
about the Canino yeah since you're the

421
00:19:27,038 --> 00:19:33,319
Creator uh

422
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:36,839
yeah I just want the spel is

423
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:38,879
that yeah the Canino we were like 3

424
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:41,519
years ago we were sitting around and

425
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,000
drinking wine and talking about how cool

426
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:44,839
it would be to have a product that was

427
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,240
alcohol free CU I think it was probably

428
00:19:44,839 --> 00:19:48,079
in the fall that we were doing this and

429
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,480
that's generally when to try to like

430
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:52,279
simmer on the drinking for a little

431
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:56,240
while and um but it'd be it's still nice

432
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:58,759
to have something like alcohol um and um

433
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,359
and so we sought out to do it and and

434
00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:03,440
started messing around with the hibiscus

435
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:06,479
tea because it's uh antioxidant it has a

436
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:08,960
nice color of red wine kind of and so

437
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,480
seemed like a natural medium to go with

438
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,679
and uh one thing led to another added

439
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,400
some Botanical and got close to recipe

440
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:17,038
and then actually Craig and I went to

441
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:20,679
wala wala and picked up wine barrels

442
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:22,960
from double back Winery to try to age

443
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:24,960
this tea in to give it the

444
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:28,640
characteristics of like a Cabernet or

445
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:31,120
something um and so and I think it's not

446
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,799
wine but I think it's close I think it

447
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:34,399
it definitely had I I don't know I feel

448
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:35,879
like people I think people liked it I

449
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,960
think people were receptive to it and I

450
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:40,600
I feel like people were uh

451
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:43,480
were understood it understood that it's

452
00:20:40,599 --> 00:20:45,199
not wine but it's kind of and we were

453
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:47,159
just putting it in little 1 o shot

454
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,558
glasses if you you know you pour a glass

455
00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:52,159
of wine which I've done with family

456
00:20:49,558 --> 00:20:54,079
members there that are not into cannabis

457
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:55,720
at all um in fact my mother-in-law just

458
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:59,879
quit referring to it as a narcotic which

459
00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:01,519
is awesome um so but she I poured her a

460
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,200
glass and she tried it which I think is

461
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:04,918
a testament to the product because

462
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,360
there's no way she would have smoked a

463
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:08,759
joint if it was getting pter on the

464
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:10,519
table um but she was willing to have a

465
00:21:08,759 --> 00:21:13,679
little glass of canabo and so it's kind

466
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:16,639
of removes that stigmatism and provides

467
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:18,360
a social atmosphere for cannabis use

468
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,919
which I think was a great alternative to

469
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:22,759
alcohol for myself personally yeah and

470
00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:26,000
it's a little more social experience

471
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:28,200
than just eating a gummy that's that

472
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,558
that's my whole consumption these days

473
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,798
is I'm married to someone who doesn't

474
00:21:29,558 --> 00:21:33,158
smoke um and so I it's not like I'm hang

475
00:21:31,798 --> 00:21:35,798
out with friends so my whole consumption

476
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:38,039
these days is like a gumy before bed or

477
00:21:35,798 --> 00:21:41,639
maybe going down to my basement and

478
00:21:38,038 --> 00:21:43,919
smoking my puff CU or but I'm by myself

479
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:46,320
you know and I'm not you know I'm not in

480
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:49,799
a social setting with that um so yeah

481
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:51,599
absolutely and how much THC is in the

482
00:21:49,798 --> 00:21:53,679
Canino we went for four to five

483
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:56,079
milligrams per glass and so this batch

484
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,640
has five and a quarter um we wanted to

485
00:21:56,079 --> 00:22:00,240
make it approachable so somebody could

486
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:02,200
have a glass um that might be a little

487
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,839
heavy for some users um so just a

488
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:06,960
smaller glass but it's for for for

489
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:08,480
people General Canabis users I think

490
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,240
four to 5 milligrams is a pretty

491
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:13,278
approachable dosage and so in the in the

492
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:16,120
bottle the wine bottle the wine bottle

493
00:22:13,278 --> 00:22:17,960
how much 21 total 21 milligram so we

494
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:20,119
went for went for four servings per

495
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:22,759
bottle so you can pour like a 6 to 8 o

496
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:24,959
glass have a nice Hefty serving and but

497
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:27,079
still only get a few milligrams as

498
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,960
opposed to having to do a shot that has

499
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:31,319
10 migs so we didn't want to get

500
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,840
anywhere near 100 milligrams in that

501
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:36,158
bottle we were 20 was as high as we want

502
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:37,319
to go honestly yeah yeah we probably in

503
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:41,120
a perfect world would have been closer

504
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:42,759
to 15 or 16 but okay yeah yeah no I I

505
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:45,079
tried it it was quite good and you know

506
00:22:42,759 --> 00:22:47,038
it has a subtle cannabis flavor to it

507
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:48,599
but you really the hibiscus tea is

508
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:50,720
really what you the the Hibiscus is

509
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:52,839
really where it's at so yeah we have a

510
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,200
we have a lady who does tea Blends for

511
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:56,959
us at the store for has and I'm actually

512
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,400
going to include her in the next round

513
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,880
and maybe try to do something that's

514
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:03,000
more like a rosé or a white and have it

515
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,000
be available in the springtime as we go

516
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,240
into summer and honestly I think that

517
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,880
would probably appeal to some of our

518
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,440
demographic even more um than going

519
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,840
after a red and I think it' actually be

520
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:16,278
easier to achieve I think that she can

521
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:18,359
give some pale teas that will have that

522
00:23:16,278 --> 00:23:19,558
finished product of a white wine that we

523
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:20,719
can get some of those floral because

524
00:23:19,558 --> 00:23:22,918
white wine is naturally a little bit

525
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,759
more floraly and that kind of thing

526
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:26,840
sometimes anyway so maybe try to I don't

527
00:23:24,759 --> 00:23:29,440
know we'll see we no one's ever done it

528
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:31,480
so we'll try I just love seeing new

529
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,600
innovative ideas so I think that was

530
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:34,038
that's very cool we'll go and we'll go

531
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:37,278
check it out in the store here awesome

532
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:37,278

533
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,880

534
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,159

535

we'll let those go and then we'll get

542

store hasco Creek Farms in cannabis

546
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:21,879
counter um the vision here was kind of

547
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:24,720
to create a much more

548
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:27,159
approachable um userfriendly

549
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,079
familyfriendly uh dispensary that had

550
00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:31,520
other health wellness products and was

551
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:32,558
more health and wellness focused so

552
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:35,000
that's what we

553
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:36,678
did well as we're walking inside tell me

554
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,679
a little bit about sort of your vision

555
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:42,480
for this place so the vision was kind of

556
00:24:38,679 --> 00:24:44,759
to create somewhere that um you know

557
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:47,038
your mother could go when I was my well

558
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:48,919
my mother's she's got Parkinson's

559
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:52,679
disease and she uses cannabis to help

560
00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:54,799
her with that and she was she 7 years

561
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:57,320
old and she's not that comfortable for

562
00:24:54,798 --> 00:24:59,000
her to go into a dispensary um and

563
00:24:57,319 --> 00:25:00,599
necessarily and get her medicine so we

564
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,200
tried to make a we wanted to make

565
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:06,879
something that was more comfortable more

566
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:11,000
open um gave people a cooler cleaner

567
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:15,120

606
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:59,120
deodorants in there the cleanest de

607
00:26:57,558 --> 00:27:00,480
deodorant we could find and kind of

608
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:02,879
we've tried to find the best of

609
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,880
everything and put it all in one place

610
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:07,600
so that people don't have to I went down

611
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,559
a rabbit hole one night trying to find a

612
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:11,558
find a good deodorant that wasn't full

613
00:27:09,558 --> 00:27:13,319
of aluminum and other oh right here and

614
00:27:11,558 --> 00:27:15,158
other things so I I appreciate that

615
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:17,519
you've done that yeah and so that's kind

616
00:27:15,159 --> 00:27:21,000
of like this is the the lotions like

617
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:21,000
that the face wash and

618
00:27:21,038 --> 00:27:25,879
then that's

619
00:27:23,038 --> 00:27:29,158
like your our deodorant line right there

620
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:32,360
is the same and like any one of those is

621
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:36,159
that very cool and then uh tell me about

622
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:38,798
safe Farmland so safe Farmland we donate

623
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:41,919
a dollar of every transa sorry a percent

624
00:27:38,798 --> 00:27:46,319
so no$ one of every sale goes to Safe

625
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:49,720
Farmland which is a 501c3 that we have

626
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:52,398
um developed that is basically designed

627
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:53,960
to kind of kind of curb development

628
00:27:52,398 --> 00:27:56,798
around here and keep some of these Open

629
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:59,798
Fields as Open Fields Andor you know

630
00:27:56,798 --> 00:28:02,319
keep some of these smaller Farms going

631
00:27:59,798 --> 00:28:05,000
um I can't I can't don't quote me on

632
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:07,519
this but like in the 70s I think it was

633
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:10,119
like 88% of the food in this Valley was

634
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:13,000
grown in this Valley and now it's like

635
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:14,839
7% or something it's it's those numbers

636
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,798
aren't completely accurate but they're

637
00:28:14,839 --> 00:28:20,759
close and that's

638
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:22,480
pretty um not really a sustainable

639
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:24,278
future in that people need to kind of

640
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,880
grow their own food at least in their in

641
00:28:24,278 --> 00:28:28,278
the area they live um and so we're

642
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:32,080
across the street

643
00:28:28,278 --> 00:28:34,480
we've donated 40 acres to save Farmland

644
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:37,439
that's the first big land donation I

645
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,839
think there's a couple more coming and

646
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,880
we've got a lot of people around the

647
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:44,720
valley involved and they are kind of

648
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:47,519
rallying behind it and we're trying to

649
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:50,079
over across the way develop a farm Hub

650
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:52,278
of sorts that would hopefully allow

651
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:53,678
younger organic farmers that maybe

652
00:28:52,278 --> 00:28:58,079
couldn't afford a plot of land around

653
00:28:53,679 --> 00:29:00,480
here a plot of land to be able to uh

654
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:01,599
um grow organic vegetables so they'll be

655
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,480
able eventually this will all be

Glacier National Park is just right down

679
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:56,278
this road I heard yep right through

680
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:57,720
those two mountains right in that canyon

681
00:29:56,278 --> 00:30:00,119
on a clear day you could see Great

682
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:02,000
Northern Mountain through that this is

683
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:05,398
our event space um we're able to have

684
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,079
events out here um in this space this is

685
00:30:05,398 --> 00:30:08,558
this is part of hasal Creek Farms which

686
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:10,558
is completely different from Cannabis

687
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:12,158
counter cannabis counter is its own

688
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:14,398
entity and own registered premise which

689
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:16,240
has given us a little more room in the

690
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:18,398
front to be able to have an event space

691
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:20,440
like this have you know your families

692
00:30:18,398 --> 00:30:23,278
come and be able to hang out and play

693
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:29,038
soccer or bot ball and

694
00:30:23,278 --> 00:30:30,798
enjoy a beautiful Montana afternoon um

695
00:30:29,038 --> 00:30:32,000
and with the with the legalities of

696
00:30:30,798 --> 00:30:33,558
everything keeping the two different

697
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,398
spaces and the two different businesses

698
00:30:33,558 --> 00:30:37,879
allows us to successfully do that so you

699
00:30:36,398 --> 00:30:41,119
essentially have two different addresses

700
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:43,760
here so so this is 1202 and cannabis

701
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:45,079
counter is 1200 war in Ro one address

702
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:47,278
and then we cruise over here and it's

703
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:48,960
another address so this is the event

704
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:50,720
space is technically yep the event space

705
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:54,278
is technically entirely different space

706
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,278
yeah very cool all right

707
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,759

right um we try to keep a similar vibe

711
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:11,278
to the front where we've really like

712
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:13,000
ethically thought out you know what we

713
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:15,839

00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:23,558
they're they're source to be clean and

716
00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:25,038
um kind of good companies that we would

717
00:31:23,558 --> 00:31:26,158
stand behind just like everything else

718
00:31:25,038 --> 00:31:27,919

then here's more of our these are all

735
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:20,480
our own products that we make in house

736
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:24,000
and we kind of do a

737
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:26,798
um five different categories uh that

738
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,599
kind of correlate with sativa and Inda

739
00:32:26,798 --> 00:32:30,119
so

740
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:32,678
you know the heavy the heavy sativa

741
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:34,839
strains we put more into a focus or

742
00:32:32,679 --> 00:32:38,559
socialize hybrids end up in more

743
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:41,278
socialize create relax and then heavy

744
00:32:38,558 --> 00:32:44,158
Inda um more sleep generally and then we

745
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:45,919
also base that off the tpes in each it's

746
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:48,320
not the only thing we use we just tpin

747
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:50,360
as well to to kind of give you more of

748
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:53,079
an idea of what what sort of feeling

749
00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:57,038
you'll get when you consume

750
00:32:53,079 --> 00:33:00,558
um whether it be you know a pen a t

751

milligrams and then we get the

775
00:34:07,638 --> 00:34:11,199
categories by washing our own hash and

776
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:13,879
