define the harm reduction potential of

25
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:06,180
cannabis in the opioid overdose epidemic

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,019
cannabis now on to the show hi ad thanks

34
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:27,269
for coming on the show today you bet

35
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:28,319
thank you so much for having me bad yeah

36
00:01:27,269 --> 00:01:31,048
well I had such a great time meeting

37
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:33,419
Steph finally in person down at photo X

38
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:35,759
and she said you'd be the best one to

39
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,259
talk to you on the show so let's just

40
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,090
dive right in can you give me a brief

41
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:41,040
background on your research and how you

42
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:44,850
got to well the place that you are today

43
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:47,219
you bet so you know I've been studying

44
00:01:44,849 --> 00:01:50,009
cannabis and cannabinoids my entire

45
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:52,489
adult life I wrote my first grant to

46
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:55,950
study cannabinoids in the laboratory in

47
00:01:52,489 --> 00:01:58,739
2004 and my hypothesis and my academic

48
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:01,649
work is that we can use cannabis and

49
00:01:58,739 --> 00:02:03,810
cannabinoids to reduce our reliance upon

50
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:04,349
prescription opioid drugs for pain

51
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:06,540
relief

52
00:02:04,349 --> 00:02:08,728
so I've studied this problem from a

53
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:11,189
number of different angles you know all

54
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:12,120
the way zoomed way and down to how the

55
00:02:11,189 --> 00:02:14,128
neurons

56
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:17,039
the brain function in the presence of

57
00:02:14,128 --> 00:02:19,079
these drugs all the way out to you know

58
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:22,079
now we're clinically managing people's

59
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,760
pain using cannabis so and a lot of

60
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,629
other things in between

61
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:30,780
so we're where I fit right now I still

62
00:02:27,628 --> 00:02:32,689
have a very you know large I'm not large

63
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:36,810
I guess but I have a very active

64
00:02:32,689 --> 00:02:39,090
academic research program but as you're

65
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:41,969
aware the federal constraints for

66
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:44,930
studying cannabis are pretty tight so we

67
00:02:41,969 --> 00:02:46,829
we have to get creative and how we're

68
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:48,659
answering some of the most burning

69
00:02:46,829 --> 00:02:52,319
questions that we have about cannabis

70
00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:54,628
and its effects on people so one of the

71
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:56,988
one of the projects I'm the most excited

72
00:02:54,628 --> 00:03:00,259
about in pretty much all of my life is

73
00:02:56,989 --> 00:03:04,730
the work that I do outside of academia

74
00:03:00,259 --> 00:03:08,189
with our company smart cannabis and

75
00:03:04,729 --> 00:03:10,169
really the the cool thing about this

76
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:12,269
project is that we get to answer some

77
00:03:10,169 --> 00:03:15,780
really fundamental questions about what

78
00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:18,359
does cannabis do in human beings healthy

79
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:20,489
human beings and the way that we've

80
00:03:18,359 --> 00:03:23,790
structured it we can answer these really

81
00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:26,909
exciting questions in a way that doesn't

82
00:03:23,789 --> 00:03:29,818
violate any laws and doesn't get us in

83
00:03:26,909 --> 00:03:31,739
trouble so you know a lot of academic

84
00:03:29,818 --> 00:03:33,628
researchers in the cannabis field have

85
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:36,060
had to get very creative and how they do

86
00:03:33,628 --> 00:03:38,608
their work in order to answer the kinds

87
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,109
of questions are interested in so for

88
00:03:38,609 --> 00:03:42,389
instance I have a colleague at

89
00:03:40,109 --> 00:03:46,319
Washington State University Kari Cutler

90
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:48,689
and she does essentially psychometric

91
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:51,839
testing she gives people you know

92
00:03:48,689 --> 00:03:53,969
computer tests to do over zoom because

93
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,419
that way she can have this person do a

94
00:03:53,969 --> 00:04:00,000
DAB / zoom instead of illegally doing a

95
00:03:57,419 --> 00:04:01,859
dab inside her laboratory so this is

96
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,628
this is what I mean with being creative

97
00:04:01,859 --> 00:04:05,879
and and how we're answering these really

98
00:04:03,628 --> 00:04:08,759
interesting questions so so yeah at the

99
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:11,489
moment you know I've built my academic

100
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:15,358
work up you know over the years NIH

101
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:17,340
grant by NIH grant and and now I do sort

102
00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:21,389
of tandem projects both inside and

103
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:23,399
outside of academia so what drew you to

104
00:04:21,389 --> 00:04:25,439
cannabis in the first place this is more

105
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:25,948
just out of personal curiosity it sounds

106
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:27,718
like

107
00:04:25,949 --> 00:04:29,218
a lot of your focus initially was on the

108
00:04:27,718 --> 00:04:32,279
medical side but now you're looking at

109
00:04:29,218 --> 00:04:34,610
sort of its affects both medically and

110
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:38,008
recreationally is that is that right

111
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:40,949
that's pretty fair yeah and I would say

112
00:04:38,009 --> 00:04:42,810
that my draw initially like really

113
00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:44,968
really early in my career as an

114
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:47,339
undergrad was pure scientific curiosity

115
00:04:44,968 --> 00:04:50,550
you know I was looking at these two

116
00:04:47,339 --> 00:04:52,888
drugs opioids and cannabinoids both of

117
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:55,408
which were used as pain relievers and I

118
00:04:52,889 --> 00:04:57,960
knew that if you use two drugs together

119
00:04:55,408 --> 00:04:59,788
at the same time often they amplify one

120
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:01,859
another's effects and that was true and

121
00:04:59,788 --> 00:05:05,068
continues to be true for both of these

122
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:07,110
drugs but you know I came into it as a

123
00:05:05,069 --> 00:05:09,300
skeptic you know I was a straightedge

124
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:12,479
hardcore punk rock kid and I was like

125
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:14,610
super anti drugs and alcohol and I I was

126
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:16,889
really interested in addiction and it

127
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:19,199
wasn't until I saw all the literature

128
00:05:16,889 --> 00:05:21,019
for myself and produced some of that

129
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,999
evidence myself that was like huh

130
00:05:21,019 --> 00:05:26,038
there's really something here and you

131
00:05:23,999 --> 00:05:28,830
know sure enough you keep following the

132
00:05:26,038 --> 00:05:30,870
evidence over you know decades and it's

133
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:35,128
a very compelling story that this is

134
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:37,500
this is clearly a safer drug compared to

135
00:05:35,129 --> 00:05:39,990
opioids when it comes to pain relief and

136
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:43,019
and even you know if we're talking about

137
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:45,509
from a pure you know altered state of

138
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:47,908
consciousness perspective altering your

139
00:05:45,509 --> 00:05:51,620
consciousness with cannabis is arguably

140
00:05:47,908 --> 00:05:54,800
more safe than doing so with alcohol so

141
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:54,800
so yeah

142
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,870
follow the evidence to understand both

143
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:04,709
the therapeutic value and the harm

144
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:06,418
reduction value that cannabis poses and

145
00:06:04,709 --> 00:06:08,938
so that's where that's where I sit now

146
00:06:06,418 --> 00:06:11,338
I'm looking at the relative safety of

147
00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:13,080
cannabis compared to other things that

148
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:15,478
we put into our body both were a

149
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:19,800
therapeutic purpose and for a purely

150
00:06:15,478 --> 00:06:23,699
personal reason and it really is true

151
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:27,060
that this is a relatively safe and occu

152
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:29,879
a substance that that most healthy

153
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:32,639
adults can use for a variety of things

154
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:35,009
and you know the way that you ask the

155
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:39,199
question kind of pits medical youth

156
00:06:35,009 --> 00:06:41,509
against adult use as a binary

157
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:45,349
choice but really I do see this as a

158
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:47,839
spectrum and one individual can fall

159
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:50,000
anywhere on that spectrum even multiple

160
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:52,969
times a day they can fall in different

161
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,060
places on that spectrum so you know the

162
00:06:52,970 --> 00:07:00,580
the ability of this plant to produce

163
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:03,889
such wide different kinds of chemistry

164
00:07:00,579 --> 00:07:06,259
matches up with the ability of the human

165
00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:08,959
to use many different kinds of plants

166
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:12,379
for many different kinds of purposes so

167
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:14,449
yeah I do I do very much see it as a

168
00:07:12,379 --> 00:07:17,779
spectrum and that's kind of where all of

169
00:07:14,449 --> 00:07:18,920
my work is is based on now yeah I think

170
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:21,649
that's a really good point you brought

171
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:24,050
up it's really the legislation that has

172
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:27,139
created this medical versus recreational

173
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:29,270
sort of binary path when when you're

174
00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:32,089
right there are all these outcomes and

175
00:07:29,269 --> 00:07:34,519
effects that people experience with

176
00:07:32,089 --> 00:07:37,250
cannabis that it's not really accurate

177
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:40,639
to just split it so so black and white

178
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:43,279
in yeah I think it's funny but oh go

179
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,319
ahead well I was just gonna say that's

180
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:46,939
even been recently reflected in the

181
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:49,939
scientific literature you know we've

182
00:07:46,939 --> 00:07:52,219
seen that if you go into a dispensary in

183
00:07:49,939 --> 00:07:54,649
Colorado a recreational dispensary and

184
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:57,350
you ask people why they're there 60 or

185
00:07:54,649 --> 00:07:58,819
70% of them will say either I'm here to

186
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:00,890
get something to help me sleep or

187
00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:04,250
relieve my pain and that's in the adult

188
00:08:00,889 --> 00:08:06,620
use market so you know like it's we see

189
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:09,319
it also played out in Oregon where you

190
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:13,189
know for a long time we had the oh mmm P

191
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:15,319
the medical marijuana program and the

192
00:08:13,189 --> 00:08:17,240
numbers of you know participants in that

193
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:19,009
program have been dwindling over the

194
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,750
years and it's not that those patients

195
00:08:19,009 --> 00:08:22,939
are going anywhere they're just not

196
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:25,639
using the medical program anymore

197
00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:28,100
so that's the other thing about cannabis

198
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:31,849
is that it is a very self empowering

199
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:33,529
tool so you know and we we tend to find

200
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:36,710
that with any kind of patient when they

201
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:38,689
feel like they are responsible for or at

202
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:41,120
least they're they're in control of

203
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:44,090
their own health that that tends to be a

204
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:47,360
good thing so the ability of people to

205
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:50,629
you know take this medical tool into

206
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,490
their own hands and use it to the degree

207
00:08:50,629 --> 00:08:52,700
that suits them you know that's kind of

208
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,470
a

209
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:57,040
win-win you have empowerment and you

210
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:59,389
have a personalized approach to medicine

211
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:00,620
yeah now we're kind of on opposite sides

212
00:08:59,389 --> 00:09:02,360
of the industry I think it's really

213
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:03,649
interesting cuz I came to cannabis sort

214
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,050
of like you did in the sense that I

215
00:09:03,649 --> 00:09:08,059
wasn't that wasn't a big user I had

216
00:09:06,049 --> 00:09:09,829
never even tried cannabis till I was 33

217
00:09:08,059 --> 00:09:11,899
I think for the first time and I was I

218
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:13,490
was so afraid I had I went hiking in the

219
00:09:11,899 --> 00:09:15,439
woods and took one little puff and I

220
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:18,139
didn't know what what sort of

221
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,610
experiences I would have because I was

222
00:09:18,139 --> 00:09:22,340
just I was a control freak and I didn't

223
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:23,690
like the idea of this but I think it's

224
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:25,910
interesting that like Michael Pollan

225
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:29,210
highlights the the fact that we all

226
00:09:25,909 --> 00:09:31,250
every society every culture human

227
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:32,570
culture attempts to alter their

228
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:34,759
consciousness in one way or another

229
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:37,790
through the use of plant-based medicines

230
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:40,039
and plants so I think that's really

231
00:09:37,789 --> 00:09:42,019
interesting but the thing that interests

232
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:44,509
me most about your research from a

233
00:09:42,019 --> 00:09:46,250
personal level is that I have I find

234
00:09:44,509 --> 00:09:48,740
that I have very different effects with

235
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:50,149
cannabis than a lot of my friends and

236
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:51,500
other people in the industry which is

237
00:09:50,149 --> 00:09:53,480
one of the reasons my focus has always

238
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:57,110
been on like cultivation and providing

239
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:59,000
you know safe clean flower that that to

240
00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:01,490
me is the most interesting aspect of it

241
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,320
but at the same time like I know these

242
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:07,399
effects are so important and like for me

243
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:10,550
with effects I if I smoke most flowers I

244
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:12,019
will get I'll get sleepy but I won't

245
00:10:10,549 --> 00:10:13,370
fail to fall asleep my brain will just

246
00:10:12,019 --> 00:10:15,409
race a million miles an hour and then

247
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:16,639
I'll just eat everything in sight and I

248
00:10:15,409 --> 00:10:19,839
seem to have that effect across a

249
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:23,389
variety of different cultivars to where

250
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:25,940
it's not as appealing to me as you know

251
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:27,980
maybe other other things like like you

252
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:30,680
mentioned alcohol which I agree is way

253
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:32,600
worse than cannabis in those cases but I

254
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:35,899
know that everyone has different sort of

255
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:37,310
effects when they consume cannabis and

256
00:10:35,899 --> 00:10:39,439
this is sort of one of the things that

257
00:10:37,309 --> 00:10:40,729
you guys are discovering and researching

258
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,940
can you start to share a little bit

259
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:46,820
about some of that research yeah

260
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:48,710
absolutely I'd be delighted to but first

261
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:50,270
I want to recognize you know like thank

262
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:52,790
you for sharing your story I think that

263
00:10:50,269 --> 00:10:56,600
it is extremely common amongst people

264
00:10:52,789 --> 00:10:59,149
and very frustrating so you know I and

265
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,250
exactly our process through the

266
00:10:59,149 --> 00:11:03,199
cultivation classic is designed to

267
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:05,720
support exactly this thing that you're

268
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,600
describing which is that engaging with

269
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,540
cannabis

270
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:12,000
is a risky behavior and what I mean by

271
00:11:09,539 --> 00:11:14,338
that is that you are taking a gamble you

272
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,139
don't necessarily know what's gonna

273
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:18,180
happen you know you can follow your bud

274
00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:20,339
tenders recommendations and you can go

275
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:22,649
based on your previous experiences or

276
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:25,259
maybe you have a friend who you know

277
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:27,120
well-versed in things but when you're

278
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:30,120
making a buying decision at the

279
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:32,940
dispensary counter for the most part you

280
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:35,278
are not really guaranteed whatever kind

281
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:37,829
of experience you know you think you

282
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:39,990
want so so that's exactly what our

283
00:11:37,828 --> 00:11:42,838
process is designed to support we want

284
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:45,180
to make it a less you know less of a

285
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:48,060
gamble you know maximum enjoyment at

286
00:11:45,179 --> 00:11:50,008
minimum risk and so you know the

287
00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:53,539
wonderful thing about the cultivation

288
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:56,990
classic is that you know not only are we

289
00:11:53,539 --> 00:12:01,259
really focusing on organic like

290
00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:04,079
regenerative kinds of flower which we

291
00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:06,329
know is best practice right we the

292
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:08,370
cannabis industry isn't gonna exist 20

293
00:12:06,328 --> 00:12:09,958
years from now if we burn out the planet

294
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:12,899
or if we burn out the people who are

295
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:15,088
using the plant so you know that's why

296
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:20,009
you know this this particular cup has

297
00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:22,110
always been focused on you know plants

298
00:12:20,009 --> 00:12:24,060
that don't use salt mineral fertilizers

299
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:26,970
but you know and we really reward

300
00:12:24,059 --> 00:12:28,859
cultivators who are you know minimizing

301
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:32,850
their carbon footprint and producing

302
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:34,528
sustainable cannabis so in Oregon what

303
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:36,540
what the competition looks like is that

304
00:12:34,528 --> 00:12:39,509
you know we accept entries from

305
00:12:36,539 --> 00:12:43,078
throughout the state last year we had

306
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:46,199
roughly 50 cultivators and a total of a

307
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:47,809
hundred and fifty flowers which we've

308
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:51,389
then put through a very rigorous

309
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:53,250
analytical chemistry panel so we you

310
00:12:51,389 --> 00:12:54,659
know use one laboratory the best

311
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:56,698
laboratory we can find

312
00:12:54,659 --> 00:12:58,379
last year it was Cascadia who

313
00:12:56,698 --> 00:12:59,849
unfortunately is no longer in the Oregon

314
00:12:58,379 --> 00:13:03,778
market but they're doing great work in

315
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:05,069
California so we've got a nice list of

316
00:13:03,778 --> 00:13:08,578
all the cannabinoids and all the

317
00:13:05,068 --> 00:13:11,309
terpenes then we take that flower and we

318
00:13:08,578 --> 00:13:14,578
distribute it to our consumer

319
00:13:11,309 --> 00:13:17,219
ambassadors our judges and we do this in

320
00:13:14,578 --> 00:13:19,318
a double-blind randomized fashion so

321
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:20,700
what that means is that I don't know

322
00:13:19,318 --> 00:13:22,860
what flowers

323
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:24,600
my judges are getting and they don't

324
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:26,550
know what flowers they're getting either

325
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:29,970
they're just in you know jars with a

326
00:13:26,549 --> 00:13:31,799
four-digit number the next level of that

327
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:34,019
process is that first of all they take a

328
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:35,699
tolerance break 48 hours before they

329
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:39,329
start engaging with the plants in their

330
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:43,110
kit our judges get about 10 flowers per

331
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:45,360
kit and they've got 30 days to use them

332
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:47,490
now that is really important and that's

333
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,680
what you know that this is a key

334
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:52,259
distinguishing factor from other kinds

335
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:54,839
of cups you know it's kind of widely

336
00:13:52,259 --> 00:13:57,059
known that other you know competitions

337
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:59,220
if you want to call them that you know

338
00:13:57,059 --> 00:14:00,989
there's a bunch of flowers that get

339
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:02,840
consumed around a conference table and

340
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:06,779
it's not exactly an objective evaluation

341
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:08,610
of which flower was the best so this is

342
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:10,439
an extremely rigorous process we want to

343
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:13,649
make sure that our judges have the time

344
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:17,280
to mindfully complete an assessment of

345
00:14:13,649 --> 00:14:19,500
the flowers that are in their kit so you

346
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,519
know we give them a nice long period of

347
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,009
time to do so

348
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:26,429
so at the end of that what we've got is

349
00:14:23,009 --> 00:14:28,340
a very valuable data set in that we've

350
00:14:26,429 --> 00:14:30,500
got high fidelity plan information

351
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:32,700
double-blinded assessment and

352
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:35,309
specifically the feedback tool that

353
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:37,620
we've designed you know that our judges

354
00:14:35,309 --> 00:14:39,869
log in to our tool and they provide

355
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:42,570
their answers to you know a survey

356
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:44,700
digitally and we can really delve into

357
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:46,080
questions not just like you know I want

358
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:48,690
to scale one to ten how much did you

359
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:51,540
like this but was the experience

360
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:53,730
desirable was the aroma desirable you

361
00:14:51,539 --> 00:14:56,219
know what are your tasting notes how did

362
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:58,860
it make your body and your emotions and

363
00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:01,920
your cognition feel we delve into all of

364
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:05,190
those deeper questions so that we can

365
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:08,490
really get a more granular idea of

366
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:12,000
exactly what effects these kinds of

367
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:14,039
flowers had in healthy human beings so

368
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,889
you know this is the this kind of

369
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:19,379
process takes a lot of effort and time

370
00:15:16,889 --> 00:15:22,379
and I think that that's you know that

371
00:15:19,379 --> 00:15:23,820
kind of investment is uncommon in in a

372
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:27,450
lot of those other events that are out

373
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:28,890
there yeah so I just I want to start off

374
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:32,009
by saying I bended the cultivation

375
00:15:28,889 --> 00:15:34,049
classic twice now maybe three times it's

376
00:15:32,009 --> 00:15:35,189
wonderful I love what you guys are doing

377
00:15:34,049 --> 00:15:36,479
there I want to get more involved with

378
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:38,630
it personally I've been talking with

379
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:42,210
Steph about that hopefully for next year

380
00:15:38,629 --> 00:15:44,279
but it's a great program and a great cup

381
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:46,769
and I do think you are doing the best

382
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:49,169
you can at sort of controlling as many

383
00:15:46,769 --> 00:15:51,809
variables as possible one question I had

384
00:15:49,169 --> 00:15:53,639
around that though was do you have any

385
00:15:51,809 --> 00:15:55,379
recommendations for people consuming at

386
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:57,840
the same time of day or same day of the

387
00:15:55,379 --> 00:15:59,789
week or like I assume people would have

388
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:02,129
a different effect if they had just you

389
00:15:59,789 --> 00:16:03,750
know won the lottery and then smoked one

390
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:05,100
of the flowers versus if they had just

391
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,929
broken up with their girlfriend and

392
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:08,850
smoked one of the flowers you know so is

393
00:16:06,929 --> 00:16:11,370
there any way to account for those sorts

394
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:13,110
of fluctuations as well or is it just

395
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:15,690
it's a little too hard to control I

396
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:17,370
don't know what do you think yeah yeah

397
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:20,310
those are those are excellent questions

398
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:22,320
and as a bench scientist those are all

399
00:16:20,309 --> 00:16:26,189
the exact kinds of variables I would

400
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:30,270
love to be able to control but I have

401
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:32,340
learned that this is the reality we live

402
00:16:30,269 --> 00:16:34,559
in people consume at different times a

403
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:37,639
day they they consume for different

404
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:41,069
purposes they have different kinds of

405
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:43,919
you know schedules and they have

406
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:47,220
different routines and that is going to

407
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:49,740
be the case no matter how small or how

408
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:52,440
large you know the the cannabis industry

409
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:56,759
is or or our sample sizes so what we

410
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:59,670
want is to capture naturalistic behavior

411
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:02,039
so you know there we do ask a few things

412
00:16:59,669 --> 00:17:03,659
to try and standardize you know to the

413
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:05,639
best of our abilities so we have some

414
00:17:03,659 --> 00:17:09,119
important questions you know when our

415
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:11,579
judges first register to try and level

416
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:15,119
the playing field a bit but in general

417
00:17:11,578 --> 00:17:17,849
you know like there it is a fact that

418
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:19,619
people's experiences and routines are

419
00:17:17,849 --> 00:17:22,078
different their expectations are

420
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:24,659
different and we have to capture the

421
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:28,139
reality out there in the world so yeah I

422
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:30,570
do agree that under ideal laboratory

423
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:34,500
kinds of conditions we might have you

424
00:17:30,569 --> 00:17:36,599
know smaller noise in the data might be

425
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:38,789
able to detect patterns a little bit

426
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:42,659
more easily if that noise is less

427
00:17:38,789 --> 00:17:45,750
prevalent but in general you know we we

428
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:47,580
have to we have to live in reality

429
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:49,470
sure and I think just to be clear this

430
00:17:47,579 --> 00:17:52,470
isn't a problem that just exists in

431
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:54,600
measuring effects of cannabis this

432
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:56,370
exists across all health research or

433
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:58,169
anything involving a human subject where

434
00:17:56,369 --> 00:18:01,919
you can't put them in a vacuum and

435
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:03,390
expand and test so that's why you just

436
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,580
it's a it's a matter of collecting so

437
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:07,320
much data that you have you know a good

438
00:18:05,579 --> 00:18:10,949
standard deviation you can create a good

439
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:12,569
mean effect and then throw out all that

440
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:15,000
data that you know all that noise that

441
00:18:12,569 --> 00:18:17,129
you mentioned that's just skews things

442
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,109
so you can you can get nice graphs down

443
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:21,540
the time over time if you collect enough

444
00:18:19,109 --> 00:18:24,359
information I guess is what I would say

445
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:27,750
around that that is exactly right that's

446
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:29,579
exactly right so let's talk about some

447
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:31,529
of your findings this I thought this was

448
00:18:29,579 --> 00:18:34,500
really interesting do you want to start

449
00:18:31,529 --> 00:18:35,849
talking about THC in general or would

450
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,650
you like to cover some of the findings

451
00:18:35,849 --> 00:18:39,629
more specifically you want to talk about

452
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:41,190
this whole indica versus sativa thing I

453
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:45,120
know there's a lot we could we could

454
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:47,400
start off with okay yeah well yeah let's

455
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:50,129
let's start off with what I think is

456
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:52,530
probably the most impactful finding that

457
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:55,500
we came across last year was that you

458
00:18:52,529 --> 00:18:57,059
know so when we're assessing we're

459
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,799
digging through all the data that we get

460
00:18:57,059 --> 00:19:01,980
at the end of our you know data

461
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:05,720
collection period and we can make a

462
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:09,240
composite you know sort of enjoyment

463
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:12,059
score essentially and you know if we if

464
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:13,620
we look at how enjoyable a flower is and

465
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:15,990
then we rank them all from the most

466
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:19,559
desirable you know all the way down to

467
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:22,859
150 it's least least desirable and zoom

468
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:26,909
in on the top 10 so the top 10 most

469
00:19:22,859 --> 00:19:31,019
enjoyable flowers in Oregon what we

470
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:36,240
notice immediately is that only 3 of

471
00:19:31,019 --> 00:19:40,650
those 10 had more than 20% THC so that

472
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:44,250
tells us that when you take the you know

473
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:47,790
the label off of a jar and you just give

474
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:50,519
a human an ability an opportunity to

475
00:19:47,789 --> 00:19:52,769
enjoy the flower they tend to report

476
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:55,559
that they like some moderate potency

477
00:19:52,769 --> 00:19:58,400
flowers the best I think even our number

478
00:19:55,559 --> 00:20:01,789
four or number six best performing flow

479
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:04,519
we're only had 6 percent THC so you know

480
00:20:01,789 --> 00:20:08,319
this this is incredibly important

481
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:13,509
because it highlights the legacy of

482
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:17,839
Prohibition namely potency so right now

483
00:20:13,509 --> 00:20:21,859
you know from the retail intake manager

484
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:27,139
to the consumer to the producer there is

485
00:20:21,859 --> 00:20:29,509
this like perpetuation of potency as the

486
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:31,759
number one value in cannabis you know

487
00:20:29,509 --> 00:20:33,859
and and I don't I don't blame people for

488
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:36,319
chasing this because historically it's

489
00:20:33,859 --> 00:20:38,299
the only information that we had that

490
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:42,019
you know quote-unquote the dank was

491
00:20:38,299 --> 00:20:44,809
always related directly to THC potency

492
00:20:42,019 --> 00:20:49,160
but what this data shows us is that

493
00:20:44,809 --> 00:20:53,119
enjoyment and intoxication are different

494
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:55,519
so you know we we know that THC potency

495
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:57,769
is correlated with intoxication for sure

496
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:59,660
that's been demonstrated in the lab it's

497
00:20:57,769 --> 00:21:01,339
common knowledge you know you can go

498
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:03,620
home yourself and do an experiment on

499
00:21:01,339 --> 00:21:06,500
yourself and know that more potent

500
00:21:03,619 --> 00:21:09,769
flowers mean more intoxication however

501
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:13,069
more intoxication doesn't necessarily

502
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:16,339
mean more enjoyment so there's this you

503
00:21:13,069 --> 00:21:18,710
know mythology that the more potent

504
00:21:16,339 --> 00:21:20,869
flowers are the most valuable flowers

505
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:23,269
but the more potent flowers are the most

506
00:21:20,869 --> 00:21:26,959
enjoyable but this data shows that

507
00:21:23,269 --> 00:21:30,200
they're not so you know I think about

508
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:33,049
potency from the perspective of an

509
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:35,870
addiction researcher and what we see in

510
00:21:33,049 --> 00:21:39,500
all illicit drug markets whether it is

511
00:21:35,869 --> 00:21:41,349
opioids or alcohol or you know in the

512
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:45,259
days of prohibition with cannabis

513
00:21:41,349 --> 00:21:49,129
prohibition promotes potency and that's

514
00:21:45,259 --> 00:21:52,670
because smugglers are trying to pack as

515
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:55,190
much of their stuff into the smallest

516
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:56,090
package possible because they have to

517
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:58,910
move it around

518
00:21:56,089 --> 00:22:01,189
that's where potency comes from so

519
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:04,100
despite the fact that we have beautiful

520
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:07,970
legal markets and somewhat functional

521
00:22:04,099 --> 00:22:10,639
cannabis economy we're still dragging

522
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:12,079
around this legacy which is completely

523
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:16,280
irrelevant

524
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:18,529
so you know I think about it a a really

525
00:22:16,279 --> 00:22:21,289
nice comparison is with moonshine you

526
00:22:18,529 --> 00:22:23,960
know like yeah moonshine is incredibly

527
00:22:21,289 --> 00:22:26,029
potent and you know it was easier to

528
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:29,090
move around than other kinds of alcohol

529
00:22:26,029 --> 00:22:32,450
because it had so much alcohol you know

530
00:22:29,089 --> 00:22:34,250
in in the smallest package possible but

531
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:36,680
but we're not in the moonshine base and

532
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:39,859
when were as you know as a consumer

533
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:42,590
going to a dispensary counter I could

534
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:44,659
make the moonshine decision or if I were

535
00:22:42,589 --> 00:22:47,629
given the opportunity if those products

536
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:50,930
existed I could choose you know a nice

537
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:54,670
glass of cab sauce or a fine eye hazy

538
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:58,130
IPA or a farmhouse ale or you know a

539
00:22:54,670 --> 00:23:01,340
barrel aged whiskey so there's so many

540
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:04,820
other experiences that are possible if

541
00:23:01,339 --> 00:23:08,629
we go if we dip below the intoxication

542
00:23:04,819 --> 00:23:10,339
level that moonshine provides us so I

543
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:11,540
have a couple questions but I want to

544
00:23:10,339 --> 00:23:14,419
start with the first one with this

545
00:23:11,539 --> 00:23:16,430
enjoyment score now does that taking

546
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:17,990
into account like when we talked about

547
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:20,539
medical some of the therapeutic benefits

548
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:22,849
is that sort of factored into that

549
00:23:20,539 --> 00:23:26,119
enjoyment score as well what sort of

550
00:23:22,849 --> 00:23:29,569
know things look at that yeah so the

551
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:31,819
enjoyment so we steer very very clear of

552
00:23:29,569 --> 00:23:34,149
any medically relevant questions other

553
00:23:31,819 --> 00:23:36,409
than maybe asking about you know

554
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:39,440
undesirable side effects which you I

555
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:44,630
guess could argue that a racing cart is

556
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:46,850
a you know an adverse outcome but you

557
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:48,680
know we're really trying to see you know

558
00:23:46,849 --> 00:23:50,839
like what is what is enjoyable and

559
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:54,259
what's least likely to produce you know

560
00:23:50,839 --> 00:23:57,679
something undesirable so now we're

561
00:23:54,259 --> 00:24:00,940
steering clear from medical utility

562
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:04,190
because if you're doing a double-blind

563
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:06,769
randomized you know if you're assigning

564
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:09,769
products to people in a double-blind

565
00:24:06,769 --> 00:24:12,440
randomized fashion and you're asking

566
00:24:09,769 --> 00:24:14,259
them medically relevant questions you're

567
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:18,640
conducting a clinical trial and

568
00:24:14,259 --> 00:24:18,640
currently that is not legal

569
00:24:19,329 --> 00:24:23,449
because it seems like you could down the

570
00:24:21,829 --> 00:24:25,250
road look at this and say okay this

571
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:27,529
particular flour

572
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:29,990
you know reduced my pain on a pain scale

573
00:24:27,529 --> 00:24:32,059
by this much versus this other flower

574
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:35,450
but I that makes a lot of sense now so I

575
00:24:32,059 --> 00:24:38,629
I get it and I'm yeah and as a pain

576
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:41,539
researcher there is absolutely nothing

577
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:44,510
that I would be more delighted to do

578
00:24:41,539 --> 00:24:47,089
then asked that very question of these

579
00:24:44,509 --> 00:24:49,339
two products which of them made your

580
00:24:47,089 --> 00:24:50,659
pain better you know that that is that's

581
00:24:49,339 --> 00:24:54,669
something that myself and my colleagues

582
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:57,250
would would our longing to be able to do

583
00:24:54,670 --> 00:25:00,350
so if I'm understanding you correctly

584
00:24:57,250 --> 00:25:04,250
basically what I'm hearing is that one

585
00:25:00,349 --> 00:25:06,409
this idea of THC being sort of a marker

586
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:10,430
for evaluating cannabis is something

587
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:12,769
that we should hopefully as a society

588
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:15,230
will stop stop doing and that we need a

589
00:25:12,769 --> 00:25:17,629
better tools for evaluating cannabis and

590
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:19,490
that's sort of what smart cannabis and

591
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:21,620
your your company is looking to

592
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:24,380
accomplish for people is a way for them

593
00:25:21,619 --> 00:25:27,799
to better evaluate the effects of these

594
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:29,420
flowers before they before purchasing

595
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:32,990
based on the amount of available data is

596
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:35,420
that that's on right yes absolutely we

597
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:38,509
want to empower the consumer to be able

598
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:40,730
to make choices that promote enjoyment

599
00:25:38,509 --> 00:25:44,029
and that are and we know at least from

600
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:45,829
this data that enjoyment and THC don't

601
00:25:44,029 --> 00:25:47,629
necessarily go hand in hand

602
00:25:45,829 --> 00:25:50,299
so one of the other really interesting

603
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:51,980
data points from this year and actually

604
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:55,369
we've seen this for a couple years in a

605
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:57,319
row now is the importance of aroma so we

606
00:25:55,369 --> 00:26:01,039
saw you know we have really nice

607
00:25:57,319 --> 00:26:03,889
correlation between the aroma of a

608
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:07,099
flower and the effects that are produced

609
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:09,830
by that flower and so what I mean by

610
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:16,279
that is you know if we look at you know

611
00:26:09,829 --> 00:26:21,079
the how how much a person enjoys a

612
00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:24,109
particular flower then that is likely to

613
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:27,319
be correlated with how good that flower

614
00:26:24,109 --> 00:26:30,229
smells so the the better a flower smells

615
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:33,200
the more likely it is that a consumer is

616
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:36,529
going to enjoy the effect you know we

617
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,610
also saw a correlation between the aroma

618
00:26:36,529 --> 00:26:38,779
and euphoria

619
00:26:37,609 --> 00:26:41,089
so euphoria

620
00:26:38,779 --> 00:26:43,730
and enjoyment are two different things

621
00:26:41,089 --> 00:26:46,819
from our perspective euphoria is a mood

622
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:48,980
state how do you feel emotionally happy

623
00:26:46,819 --> 00:26:51,980
yes or no and then the other one is a

624
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:53,630
preference do I like this so yeah it

625
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:56,269
kind of makes sense that if you're happy

626
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:59,180
you're gonna like it but we find that

627
00:26:56,269 --> 00:27:00,889
that is related to the aroma of the

628
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:02,810
flower so you know in the cultivation

629
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:04,670
community and your listeners will

630
00:27:02,809 --> 00:27:07,460
probably this will ring very true to

631
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:11,420
them there's that old saying the nose

632
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:13,579
nose and so you know at our at our award

633
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:17,779
ceremony in May we have the nose nose

634
00:27:13,579 --> 00:27:20,389
award for an exemplary cultivar that

635
00:27:17,779 --> 00:27:22,549
smells great that produces a really nice

636
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:25,970
psychological state in our people and

637
00:27:22,549 --> 00:27:27,319
makes them happy yeah I want to talk

638
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:29,059
about more of your findings but a

639
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:30,500
question popped in my head while you

640
00:27:29,059 --> 00:27:33,470
were talking about this that I was

641
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:37,730
wondering so along with the challenges

642
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:40,370
of sort of identifying these variables

643
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:42,860
and and creating this these graphs

644
00:27:40,369 --> 00:27:47,119
around these flowers how do you account

645
00:27:42,859 --> 00:27:48,979
for variability among a given cultivar

646
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:50,569
so like when we talk about like a chemo

647
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:52,190
of our expression something that I know

648
00:27:50,569 --> 00:27:54,710
Jeremy plumb is really passionate about

649
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:56,450
and talking dives into do you see this

650
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:59,539
becoming like the wine industry where

651
00:27:56,450 --> 00:28:01,940
the 2017 oh gee coach that was grown

652
00:27:59,539 --> 00:28:04,159
outdoors on this farm was sort of that

653
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:05,660
you know created this one experience and

654
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:07,910
then next year it may be a different

655
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:09,019
experience altogether because they may

656
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:10,460
have changed something in the soil

657
00:28:09,019 --> 00:28:12,200
profile it might have perceived more

658
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:15,230
water or more sunlight you know all of

659
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:17,330
these different variables right you're

660
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:19,849
absolutely right and this is a tricky

661
00:28:17,329 --> 00:28:22,129
question which I think will a we're

662
00:28:19,849 --> 00:28:24,649
working on it and B it will take some

663
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:26,930
time to really fully develop and it'll

664
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:29,600
need some consensus among the community

665
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:32,570
because you know from my perspective

666
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:36,439
like the most conservative thing is to

667
00:28:32,569 --> 00:28:38,869
say that you always have a novel

668
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:41,660
cultivar no matter if you put the same

669
00:28:38,869 --> 00:28:45,169
you know name on it or not you know it

670
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:47,630
is even under very tightly controlled

671
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:49,730
growing conditions you know artificial

672
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:52,190
intelligence controlled greenhouse stuff

673
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:55,009
like you know even under those type

674
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:57,350
controlled conditions with genetics that

675
00:28:55,009 --> 00:28:59,149
are identical harvest to harvest we have

676
00:28:57,349 --> 00:29:01,490
genetic drift you know we have

677
00:28:59,148 --> 00:29:04,609
environmental changes that very

678
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:07,339
profoundly affect phytochemistry and so

679
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:09,349
from my perspective every single time we

680
00:29:07,339 --> 00:29:12,319
produce a certificate of analysis for a

681
00:29:09,349 --> 00:29:14,689
cultivar it's a unique thing it's a it's

682
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:17,329
a totally new thing every single time so

683
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:19,788
I don't think you know unlike wine I

684
00:29:17,329 --> 00:29:22,638
think it'll be much more difficult to

685
00:29:19,788 --> 00:29:24,980
you know routinely produce the exact

686
00:29:22,638 --> 00:29:27,408
same chemistry time after time after

687
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:28,788
time I think that we're getting closer

688
00:29:27,409 --> 00:29:30,950
to that and I do think that you know

689
00:29:28,788 --> 00:29:33,888
Jeremy is a prime example of you know

690
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:36,110
the the level of rigor it takes to get

691
00:29:33,888 --> 00:29:39,859
those harvest harvest really really

692
00:29:36,109 --> 00:29:41,808
reproducible outcomes but I'm again like

693
00:29:39,859 --> 00:29:43,428
I'm okay with this you know this is the

694
00:29:41,808 --> 00:29:45,138
world we live in we have a lot of

695
00:29:43,429 --> 00:29:48,110
variability in that plant because it is

696
00:29:45,138 --> 00:29:50,479
crazy sensitive to its environment so if

697
00:29:48,109 --> 00:29:52,519
that's the case then great but I do

698
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:56,500
think that there is work to be done in

699
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:59,120
creating rough categories of kheema bars

700
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:02,148
so that is you know we have our types 1

701
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:05,628
2 &amp; 3 or THC dominant and then hemp like

702
00:30:02,148 --> 00:30:08,209
you know flowers and then within those

703
00:30:05,628 --> 00:30:10,278
be there probably is some further you

704
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:13,278
know chemo taxonomy that's related to

705
00:30:10,278 --> 00:30:16,159
the terpene expression but even you know

706
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:19,009
we're looking at hops and we're looking

707
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:21,379
at other you know agricultural products

708
00:30:19,009 --> 00:30:23,480
and we know that a lot of the aroma from

709
00:30:21,378 --> 00:30:26,480
hops doesn't necessarily come from

710
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:29,628
terpenes it comes from other molecules

711
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:32,480
that don't currently appear on anyone's

712
00:30:29,628 --> 00:30:36,589
certificate of analysis they're totally

713
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:38,778
not on the radar so you know this is

714
00:30:36,589 --> 00:30:41,329
this is something that you know I think

715
00:30:38,778 --> 00:30:43,460
that it's going to be this is what's the

716
00:30:41,329 --> 00:30:46,069
most exciting thing to me about cannabis

717
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:48,379
is that it's like the Mariana Trench

718
00:30:46,069 --> 00:30:50,298
both in terms of the chemicals it

719
00:30:48,378 --> 00:30:52,158
produces as well as what those chemicals

720
00:30:50,298 --> 00:30:55,128
do in the people that are consuming the

721
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:57,649
plant so we have many many decades of

722
00:30:55,128 --> 00:30:59,329
discovery ahead of us but but yeah we're

723
00:30:57,648 --> 00:31:00,888
currently working on a project we're

724
00:30:59,329 --> 00:31:03,019
using this data set from the cultivation

725
00:31:00,888 --> 00:31:04,878
classic in partnership with some

726
00:31:03,019 --> 00:31:05,660
colleagues in California to see like

727
00:31:04,878 --> 00:31:08,269
okay

728
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:10,550
if we can model different chemo types

729
00:31:08,269 --> 00:31:12,740
you know what kinds of buckets of

730
00:31:10,549 --> 00:31:14,839
cannabis are there and then can we

731
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:18,910
create a predictive model which will

732
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:20,990
then you know fit these new you know

733
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:22,759
cultivars that are coming out and put

734
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:26,690
those into those different you know

735
00:31:22,759 --> 00:31:30,140
chemo taxonomic buckets that's that's

736
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:31,820
really interesting so you mentioned you

737
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:34,820
mentioned smell and we talked a little

738
00:31:31,819 --> 00:31:37,220
bit about genes and I know you have some

739
00:31:34,819 --> 00:31:39,289
chirping data and one of the things that

740
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:40,819
I learned I wasn't aware of was that you

741
00:31:39,289 --> 00:31:44,089
know cannabis for a long time was Merce

742
00:31:40,819 --> 00:31:46,129
mersin dominant primarily and now we're

743
00:31:44,089 --> 00:31:48,379
starting over the last few years we're

744
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:50,060
seeing more variability in that can you

745
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:51,440
talk a little bit about what you're what

746
00:31:50,059 --> 00:31:54,169
you're seeing in terms of the

747
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:56,600
variability now in terpenes and what

748
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:59,150
effects people are reporting related to

749
00:31:56,599 --> 00:32:00,859
that data yeah for sure

750
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:04,190
you know the effects thing is tricky

751
00:32:00,859 --> 00:32:07,789
because our data set would tell us that

752
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:09,769
the mindset of the person is the most

753
00:32:07,789 --> 00:32:12,230
predictive thing the mindset and the

754
00:32:09,769 --> 00:32:14,329
aroma are the most predictive things so

755
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:17,240
if this person expects it to have an

756
00:32:14,329 --> 00:32:18,980
indica like response then it's that's

757
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:21,220
what it's going to do for them which is

758
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:24,579
not that surprising if we look at

759
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:26,900
cannabis essentially or THC being a mile

760
00:32:24,579 --> 00:32:28,939
classic psychedelic and if you look at

761
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:32,150
all the other classic psychedelic drugs

762
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:35,480
some mindsets prior to ingesting the

763
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:38,240
drug is a huge component in the ultimate

764
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:40,339
outcome so if you have an expectation

765
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,750
that this product is going to do this

766
00:32:40,339 --> 00:32:44,779
for you it's kind of a self-fulfilling

767
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:46,279
prophecy so you know with with the data

768
00:32:44,779 --> 00:32:48,470
that we currently have it's not

769
00:32:46,279 --> 00:32:51,410
sufficiently large enough to detect

770
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:53,720
these patterns not to mention the fact

771
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:56,090
that you know we're not just looking at

772
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:58,850
the effect of mere seen we're looking at

773
00:32:56,089 --> 00:33:01,849
the effect of mere seen in combination

774
00:32:58,849 --> 00:33:04,819
with all of this other huge host of

775
00:33:01,849 --> 00:33:06,829
chemicals that you know polypharmacy is

776
00:33:04,819 --> 00:33:09,259
a completely different ball games and

777
00:33:06,829 --> 00:33:13,490
you know just taking mere scene on its

778
00:33:09,259 --> 00:33:15,769
own so you know if we look at what we've

779
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:17,750
seen in the data this year compared to

780
00:33:15,769 --> 00:33:19,519
last year one of the things that's

781
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:21,619
unfortunate is that

782
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:23,509
you know we see a lot of plants that

783
00:33:21,619 --> 00:33:26,329
tend to be more similar to one another

784
00:33:23,509 --> 00:33:28,579
compared to you know a different from

785
00:33:26,329 --> 00:33:31,279
one another and we would really like to

786
00:33:28,579 --> 00:33:33,470
see all the freaks we would love for

787
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:37,099
people to submit flowers that are very

788
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:39,769
unique and very special but what we have

789
00:33:37,099 --> 00:33:42,230
seen is that you know compared to last

790
00:33:39,769 --> 00:33:45,799
year we have way more turpentine

791
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:47,000
dominant cultivars so you know this is

792
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:49,849
you know for some of the old-school

793
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,609
folks out there Dutch treat the smell of

794
00:33:49,849 --> 00:33:54,559
Dutch treat that's the turpentine

795
00:33:51,609 --> 00:33:57,740
dominant aroma this tends to be also a

796
00:33:54,559 --> 00:34:00,529
very potent aroma intense so you know

797
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:02,839
like a lot of people can detect oh I'm I

798
00:34:00,529 --> 00:34:04,430
don't know you know a lot of different

799
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:07,039
types of weed from one another but I can

800
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:09,050
smell turpentine it's a very distinct

801
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:10,610
aroma same thing with citrus something

802
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:12,380
has a citrus aroma that tends to be

803
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:14,929
really distinct in people's minds and

804
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:17,720
you know like five out of seven judges

805
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:19,398
can easily detect a citrus aroma you

806
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:22,189
know they don't have to be trained in

807
00:34:19,398 --> 00:34:26,509
sensory evaluation to go yep this smells

808
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:29,179
like citrus so so yeah and I think that

809
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:32,120
that speaks to you know trend you know

810
00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:34,639
just like perfumes we have you know a

811
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:36,529
number of years ago sandalwood was

812
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:38,000
really popular and there all these

813
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:39,919
perfumes on the market that smelled like

814
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,380
sandalwood and then dude it was really

815
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:44,239
popular food oil was very popular and so

816
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:47,419
many perfumes out there that had food as

817
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:50,209
their you know primary aroma and so you

818
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:53,059
know I I can suspect that if we allow

819
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:55,309
the market to be driven by the sensory

820
00:34:53,059 --> 00:34:57,139
experience of Canada's that we would see

821
00:34:55,309 --> 00:34:59,809
very similar trends that things would

822
00:34:57,139 --> 00:35:01,369
wax and wane over time chirpin almond

823
00:34:59,809 --> 00:35:03,230
might you know to pennilyn might have

824
00:35:01,369 --> 00:35:05,389
been hot this year but maybe next year

825
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:07,400
we'll have pining dominant you know cult

826
00:35:05,389 --> 00:35:11,089
the viruses are frontrunners who knows

827
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:14,059
oh that's really interesting yeah so you

828
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:16,340
also found research around gender - if

829
00:35:14,059 --> 00:35:19,909
that if that's right what I remember

830
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:23,690
from the presentation with Steph welcome

831
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:25,759
matter No yeah I mean so gender is a

832
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:28,250
social construct and specifically the

833
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:30,320
question we asked was biological sex and

834
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:32,869
the reason we asked the question that

835
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:35,059
way is because we know from

836
00:35:32,869 --> 00:35:37,849
the scientific literature that cannabis

837
00:35:35,059 --> 00:35:38,389
affects biological males and biological

838
00:35:37,849 --> 00:35:39,679
females

839
00:35:38,389 --> 00:35:42,379
differently you know there are different

840
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:44,690
rates of the development of tolerance to

841
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:47,240
th see there are different effects on

842
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:49,460
our hormonal systems so it was important

843
00:35:47,239 --> 00:35:51,379
for us to see you know it can we

844
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:53,470
actually detect a sex difference and are

845
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:56,360
there kinds of cannabis that are

846
00:35:53,469 --> 00:36:00,139
biologically better suited for men and

847
00:35:56,360 --> 00:36:03,140
women our biological men and women and

848
00:36:00,139 --> 00:36:06,259
so you know we were able to you know use

849
00:36:03,139 --> 00:36:07,849
all of the data to find you know a

850
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:10,130
cultivar you know we thought we found

851
00:36:07,849 --> 00:36:12,559
cultivars that were like equally amongst

852
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:14,599
men and women these are like outstanding

853
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:17,869
flowers that one for whatever other

854
00:36:14,599 --> 00:36:20,690
reasons that they want but we were able

855
00:36:17,869 --> 00:36:22,969
to find you know one standout flower

856
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:25,429
that produce a really nice effect and a

857
00:36:22,969 --> 00:36:30,079
very desirable aroma for women but the

858
00:36:25,429 --> 00:36:32,809
men were kind of like oh that's one that

859
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:36,139
we we deemed that one that was the

860
00:36:32,809 --> 00:36:37,789
ladies Choice Award so that that was

861
00:36:36,139 --> 00:36:40,069
that's a beautiful flower and it just so

862
00:36:37,789 --> 00:36:42,650
happens to be my personal favorite as

863
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:45,680
well so it's a type 2a you know roughly

864
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:48,769
6 percent THC it's a lovely lovely Cold

865
00:36:45,679 --> 00:36:51,679
War thank you for correcting me on the

866
00:36:48,769 --> 00:36:55,340
biological versus gender differences

867
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:56,750
thank you I appreciate that yeah it's

868
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:58,760
important to highlight that and then I

869
00:36:56,750 --> 00:37:01,329
realized the way that came across so

870
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:04,700
yeah that's I think that's important and

871
00:37:01,329 --> 00:37:06,619
personally for myself the the one flower

872
00:37:04,699 --> 00:37:08,960
that I really enjoyed happened to be a

873
00:37:06,619 --> 00:37:12,279
type 2 flower called kava that was grown

874
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:18,500
by up here by a company called gold leaf

875
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:22,490
so these type twos yeah the type twos

876
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:24,260
have very I think that this is where we

877
00:37:22,489 --> 00:37:26,119
have a lot of promise in the future of

878
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:29,150
the industry is with these type twos you

879
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:30,920
know like this like you were saying your

880
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:33,260
personal experience with cannabis is

881
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:36,289
that yeah like you might feel sleepy but

882
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:39,110
your mind is going crazy and to me

883
00:37:36,289 --> 00:37:43,039
that's very indicative of a frankly a

884
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:45,980
THC overdose so what what's possible

885
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:46,800
below that threshold of intoxication so

886
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:48,809
if you you

887
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:51,750
there's two ways you can do that you can

888
00:37:48,809 --> 00:37:54,420
slowly dial back from 20 20 and 30%

889
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:56,130
flowers and see what you feel or you

890
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:57,960
could work your way up from hemp you

891
00:37:56,130 --> 00:38:00,539
know starting with a heavy hunt product

892
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:03,360
and then you know especially for a new

893
00:38:00,539 --> 00:38:05,759
consumer who has an intolerance you know

894
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:10,230
the the easiest way to not have a bad

895
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:12,690
time is to not consume too much THC so

896
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:15,389
so yeah this is where I think the type 2

897
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:17,940
flowers are really valuable because one

898
00:38:15,389 --> 00:38:20,879
they're balanced with CBD which is you

899
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:23,550
know experimentally been shown to reduce

900
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:26,070
the paranoia and anxiety that's produced

901
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:27,810
by PhD so if you're consuming them in

902
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:29,370
roughly equal amounts great you're

903
00:38:27,809 --> 00:38:30,299
protecting yourself from that paranoia

904
00:38:29,369 --> 00:38:33,359
to begin with

905
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:36,180
you've got enough THC on board to get

906
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:38,010
yourself into the therapeutic window and

907
00:38:36,179 --> 00:38:40,079
what I mean by that is if we look in

908
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:41,700
medicine every drug has a therapeutic

909
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:44,909
window where you have to take a certain

910
00:38:41,699 --> 00:38:46,949
dose where the patient feels it but if

911
00:38:44,909 --> 00:38:49,079
you take too high of a dose then

912
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:51,509
negative side effects start to happen

913
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:53,639
and this is exactly the same with THC

914
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:55,650
but if you take it out of the context of

915
00:38:53,639 --> 00:38:58,379
medicine and just look at enjoyment you

916
00:38:55,650 --> 00:39:00,450
got to get up into the therapeutic

917
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:02,010
window so that you can feel it but you

918
00:39:00,449 --> 00:39:03,629
can't take so much that now you have

919
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:06,210
racing thoughts racing heart dry eyes

920
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:08,369
dry mouth blah blah blah blah so you

921
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:11,820
know these type 2 flowers have an

922
00:39:08,369 --> 00:39:13,679
immense potential to have wide appeal

923
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:15,200
across many different kinds of people

924
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:21,389
for many different kinds of purposes

925
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:22,619
because they're just less risky I like

926
00:39:21,389 --> 00:39:23,099
that and that fits with me one of the

927
00:39:22,619 --> 00:39:24,869
things

928
00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:26,969
Jeff lowenfeld said he was asked you

929
00:39:24,869 --> 00:39:28,349
know what's the most potent flower

930
00:39:26,969 --> 00:39:30,329
you've ever tried and things like that

931
00:39:28,349 --> 00:39:32,130
and all these questions and basically

932
00:39:30,329 --> 00:39:33,509
what he what he said around it which I

933
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:35,910
thought was a good point was like hey we

934
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:38,940
don't need to go stronger and stronger

935
00:39:35,909 --> 00:39:41,219
like that's that's not the that's not

936
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:43,170
the solution like you can always you

937
00:39:41,219 --> 00:39:45,209
know take another hit you know you can

938
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:47,099
always have a little bit more let's stop

939
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:50,789
trying to get this you know like I said

940
00:39:47,099 --> 00:39:54,150
like these 25-30 percent THC dominant

941
00:39:50,789 --> 00:39:55,409
flowers and yeah it sounds like your

942
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:57,210
research is sort of supporting that

943
00:39:55,409 --> 00:39:59,309
concept so you actually have some data

944
00:39:57,210 --> 00:40:00,530
to support that now and I guess what I'm

945
00:39:59,309 --> 00:40:02,509
wondering is how

946
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:04,190
how does this impact growers so let's

947
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:07,150
talk a little bit about that so as a

948
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:11,900
grower how can I use this information to

949
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:15,440
better you know cultivate and sell my

950
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:17,450
product ma'am this I love this question

951
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:19,519
so much and thank you for asking it I

952
00:40:17,449 --> 00:40:25,149
want to start the answer with an

953
00:40:19,519 --> 00:40:29,119
anecdote so one of our judges is also a

954
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:31,579
cultivator in the cultivation classic so

955
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:33,500
and and he's been involved in this

956
00:40:31,579 --> 00:40:35,539
process since the very beginning

957
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:36,920
he's always submitted flower and I think

958
00:40:35,539 --> 00:40:40,489
he's always been a judge he might have

959
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:43,309
missed a year um but in one of his early

960
00:40:40,489 --> 00:40:45,439
years you know we gave him his feedback

961
00:40:43,309 --> 00:40:46,730
we revealed at the end hey these were

962
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:50,179
all the flowers that you liked the best

963
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:52,849
and he was shocked to find that some of

964
00:40:50,179 --> 00:40:54,649
his most favorable responses were to

965
00:40:52,849 --> 00:40:56,719
flowers that had a really high CBD

966
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:59,630
content and he was kind of bummed

967
00:40:56,719 --> 00:41:02,359
because he had absolutely zero CBD in

968
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:04,880
his garden so what did he do he went

969
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:07,430
back and he introduced some CBD and some

970
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:09,140
more balanced phytochemistry into his

971
00:41:07,429 --> 00:41:11,059
garden and you know their business was

972
00:41:09,139 --> 00:41:13,429
doing really great he's got wonderful

973
00:41:11,059 --> 00:41:16,340
wonderful products on the market but

974
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:18,710
it's not all that surprising so if you

975
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:21,079
ask these cultivators like what is your

976
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:23,050
what is your most treasured flower that

977
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:25,840
you're producing a lot of them will say

978
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:29,930
man I've got this purple girl who's like

979
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:32,600
14 to 17 percent THC she smells like you

980
00:41:29,929 --> 00:41:34,969
know Flintstone vitamins and it's just

981
00:41:32,599 --> 00:41:37,730
the most beautiful thing best experience

982
00:41:34,969 --> 00:41:41,599
it's transcendental I can't sell it

983
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:45,079
because it's less than 20% THC so the

984
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:46,819
cultivators already know this and the

985
00:41:45,079 --> 00:41:49,039
consumers if they're if they ever have

986
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:51,320
an opportunity to try and moderate you

987
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:54,079
know potency flower they often will also

988
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:55,490
say yeah I can only take one hit or

989
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:57,799
wouldn't it be nice if I could take two

990
00:41:55,489 --> 00:41:59,599
hits like you know cuz I really enjoy it

991
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:02,269
I like the taste of it I like the

992
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:05,329
experience but you know those potent

993
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:07,309
flowers just that it's not fun for me so

994
00:42:05,329 --> 00:42:09,590
the customer often knows it sometimes

995
00:42:07,309 --> 00:42:12,380
they don't you know there's still a ton

996
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:14,000
of THC hunting out there but the

997
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:16,700
customer you know is is

998
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:19,519
to realize that you know potency is not

999
00:42:16,699 --> 00:42:21,799
necessarily the best so the cultivator

1000
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:24,170
knows it and the consumer sometimes

1001
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:29,390
knows it but there's a really critical

1002
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:32,809
sort of choke point at the intake level

1003
00:42:29,389 --> 00:42:34,940
at retail intake so I've talked to

1004
00:42:32,809 --> 00:42:37,759
retail intake managers in Washington who

1005
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:40,670
literally tell me my boss won't let me

1006
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:44,450
buy any flowers that has less than 17

1007
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:46,070
percent THC those flowers have literally

1008
00:42:44,449 --> 00:42:50,089
been cut out of the market

1009
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:52,519
so those ones that fit so beautifully in

1010
00:42:50,090 --> 00:42:54,980
the therapeutic window that are so

1011
00:42:52,519 --> 00:42:57,860
wonderfully produced in the full Sun

1012
00:42:54,980 --> 00:43:00,920
with a rich terpene profile and moderate

1013
00:42:57,860 --> 00:43:03,320
potency those flowers that are the most

1014
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:04,849
enjoyable are ironically the ones that

1015
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:08,420
are least likely to be found on the

1016
00:43:04,849 --> 00:43:09,920
dispensary shelf it's a real shame yeah

1017
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:12,889
I think it's a big problem so how do we

1018
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:16,159
address that as a society how do we

1019
00:43:12,889 --> 00:43:18,049
educate consumers to select flowers that

1020
00:43:16,159 --> 00:43:20,269
are you know going to be more enjoyable

1021
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:24,230
for them over time how do we move away

1022
00:43:20,269 --> 00:43:27,679
from this sort of THC dominant thought

1023
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:30,019
process yeah I think that it requires

1024
00:43:27,679 --> 00:43:32,329
this is a big problem that doesn't have

1025
00:43:30,019 --> 00:43:34,460
one solution I think we need to address

1026
00:43:32,329 --> 00:43:37,819
the problem from multiple angles

1027
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:40,280
you know we clearly need widespread PSA

1028
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:45,140
level information like hey you're too

1029
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:47,600
high on a billboard but we also need you

1030
00:43:45,139 --> 00:43:51,349
know bud tenders and and and intake

1031
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:53,210
managers who have the education as well

1032
00:43:51,349 --> 00:43:56,059
to be able to pass on that knowledge

1033
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:57,889
directly at the counter where when they

1034
00:43:56,059 --> 00:44:00,320
have a consumer who comes in and says

1035
00:43:57,889 --> 00:44:03,529
what's the most THC I can get you know

1036
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:05,780
for my six dollars a gram then the

1037
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:09,530
budtender could say well you you could

1038
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:12,110
take that moonshine route and why don't

1039
00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:14,930
you also try this other thing because

1040
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:18,170
you know like yeah that'll get you mess

1041
00:44:14,929 --> 00:44:21,259
up but we have this other thing which

1042
00:44:18,170 --> 00:44:24,200
might actually be more enjoyable so I

1043
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:26,990
think that it is you know a multi-modal

1044
00:44:24,199 --> 00:44:27,769
approach we need to have bud tenders who

1045
00:44:26,989 --> 00:44:31,429
really

1046
00:44:27,769 --> 00:44:35,179
not only you know get this information

1047
00:44:31,429 --> 00:44:38,349
but they experience it for themselves

1048
00:44:35,179 --> 00:44:42,730
you know the intake managers are open to

1049
00:44:38,349 --> 00:44:45,529
producing higher values monetary values

1050
00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:48,019
for type 2 flowers and flowers with

1051
00:44:45,530 --> 00:44:50,269
moderate potency and of course you know

1052
00:44:48,019 --> 00:44:52,789
like a widespread you know public

1053
00:44:50,269 --> 00:44:55,309
education campaign about you know like

1054
00:44:52,789 --> 00:44:59,389
THC and all it's cracked up to be

1055
00:44:55,309 --> 00:45:01,369
I told Leah Gris I hope that I hope

1056
00:44:59,389 --> 00:45:04,099
you're right my concern is is it from a

1057
00:45:01,369 --> 00:45:06,109
growing perspective as a cultivator you

1058
00:45:04,099 --> 00:45:08,690
know it's risky to try and cultivate a

1059
00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:11,660
flower that's under 17% that may not

1060
00:45:08,690 --> 00:45:14,389
sell sell on the on the shelf is it

1061
00:45:11,659 --> 00:45:18,079
possible to use this data as a consumer

1062
00:45:14,389 --> 00:45:19,819
facing approach to where this could be

1063
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:21,199
near the flower or out by the flowers

1064
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:23,930
and people could say hey we're seeing

1065
00:45:21,199 --> 00:45:26,029
these responses on this flower give it a

1066
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:27,980
try yes

1067
00:45:26,030 --> 00:45:30,200
absolutely and that's one of the huge

1068
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:32,869
benefits from our processes that we're

1069
00:45:30,199 --> 00:45:35,359
able to take this data and feed it back

1070
00:45:32,869 --> 00:45:37,279
to the cultivator and feed it back to

1071
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:39,890
the consumer so our judges at the end

1072
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:41,600
you know they get access to all of their

1073
00:45:39,889 --> 00:45:43,369
you know we unblind them and tell them

1074
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:45,829
what they liked the best and they go wow

1075
00:45:43,369 --> 00:45:47,389
I had no idea just like you know that

1076
00:45:45,829 --> 00:45:50,869
cultivator anecdote that I told you

1077
00:45:47,389 --> 00:45:52,969
earlier so yeah I would love to see that

1078
00:45:50,869 --> 00:45:54,559
deployed at a larger scale level and we

1079
00:45:52,969 --> 00:45:56,779
have some projects that we're working on

1080
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:58,849
that are moving toward that you know

1081
00:45:56,780 --> 00:46:02,360
really enabling that consumer to have a

1082
00:45:58,849 --> 00:46:06,019
personalized experience but you know is

1083
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:09,620
is based on their own experience with

1084
00:46:06,019 --> 00:46:11,269
different cultivars of cannabis and yeah

1085
00:46:09,619 --> 00:46:15,920
you're absolutely right that this is a

1086
00:46:11,269 --> 00:46:18,320
risk like you have to all of the you

1087
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:22,210
know decisions wholesale and retail

1088
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:24,920
level are currently being made on

1089
00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:27,980
historical data right we're looking

1090
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:29,510
backwards to see what sold last quarter

1091
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:30,980
and a quarter before that and the

1092
00:46:29,510 --> 00:46:34,310
quarter before that and that's where

1093
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:36,820
we're assuming that the future is a

1094
00:46:34,309 --> 00:46:40,579
hundred percent dependent upon the past

1095
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:41,539
when really what we need is to not ask

1096
00:46:40,579 --> 00:46:43,489
you know

1097
00:46:41,539 --> 00:46:46,880
what do people think they want to buy

1098
00:46:43,489 --> 00:46:49,969
but really what do people actually need

1099
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:51,920
so it's less looking backward to see

1100
00:46:49,969 --> 00:46:56,599
what sold previously and more looking

1101
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:58,760
forward about what people will be buying

1102
00:46:56,599 --> 00:47:00,259
in the future because it's a more

1103
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:02,990
enjoyable experience and that's

1104
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:06,290
precisely what this what this project is

1105
00:47:02,989 --> 00:47:07,699
aimed at doing yeah so what do you see

1106
00:47:06,289 --> 00:47:09,079
for the future of this industry I know

1107
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:10,460
we've kind of touched on it a little bit

1108
00:47:09,079 --> 00:47:13,159
but was there anything else you wanted

1109
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:15,050
to add to that in terms of what you're

1110
00:47:13,159 --> 00:47:18,879
seeing or how you what direction you see

1111
00:47:15,050 --> 00:47:22,070
is going for sure you know I think that

1112
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:24,710
what we have learned from other

1113
00:47:22,070 --> 00:47:27,350
agricultural products is that you know

1114
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:29,539
as things happen with corporate

1115
00:47:27,349 --> 00:47:32,799
consolidation there's this trend toward

1116
00:47:29,539 --> 00:47:36,190
monocropping and producing an

1117
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:39,980
agricultural product for yield and

1118
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:44,420
producing a product for yield at scale

1119
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:46,880
is like the entirely opposite thing that

1120
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:50,420
our data reveals which is that these you

1121
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:52,610
know craft types of artists and flowers

1122
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:54,740
are the ones that tend to be the most

1123
00:47:52,610 --> 00:47:58,190
diverse and terpenes the most

1124
00:47:54,739 --> 00:48:00,369
interesting and and desirable smelling

1125
00:47:58,190 --> 00:48:04,099
and the ones that produce the most

1126
00:48:00,369 --> 00:48:06,319
enjoyable experiences so you know I

1127
00:48:04,099 --> 00:48:08,509
would hope that this industry would take

1128
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:11,180
an evidence-based approach as well as a

1129
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:13,100
practical one in that we need to have

1130
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:15,699
sustainable products that aren't you

1131
00:48:13,099 --> 00:48:19,219
know pulling resources out of this earth

1132
00:48:15,699 --> 00:48:21,199
and we need to be putting products into

1133
00:48:19,219 --> 00:48:23,299
our bodies that don't burn out our

1134
00:48:21,199 --> 00:48:24,919
endocannabinoids systems and put us at

1135
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:27,230
risk for cannabis use disorder and

1136
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:29,539
hyperemesis and all the other health

1137
00:48:27,230 --> 00:48:33,500
risks that are associated with potent

1138
00:48:29,539 --> 00:48:36,559
THC products I completely understand

1139
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:38,659
where how we got to the place we are

1140
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:41,269
where everyone is trying to push their

1141
00:48:38,659 --> 00:48:44,449
certificates of analysis up to that 30

1142
00:48:41,269 --> 00:48:47,929
percent mark but the reality is that

1143
00:48:44,449 --> 00:48:50,119
when you give people a chance to consume

1144
00:48:47,929 --> 00:48:53,359
cannabis in a blinded fashion that's

1145
00:48:50,119 --> 00:48:55,130
just not what they want so I think it's

1146
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:57,170
going to take some growing pains and I

1147
00:48:55,130 --> 00:48:59,750
think it's going to take some leaps of

1148
00:48:57,170 --> 00:49:02,240
faith it's gonna take you know a small

1149
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:04,369
part of the garden dedicated to you know

1150
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:06,109
a nice moderate potency flower and just

1151
00:49:04,369 --> 00:49:08,599
kind of cross your fingers and see what

1152
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:10,190
happens with that guy but I think that

1153
00:49:08,599 --> 00:49:12,139
there is a moderate path here you know I

1154
00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:14,420
don't think it makes sense to completely

1155
00:49:12,139 --> 00:49:15,829
just like flip the market overnight

1156
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:19,159
where all of a sudden you know noe is

1157
00:49:15,829 --> 00:49:22,190
growing 25% flowers anymore but the slow

1158
00:49:19,159 --> 00:49:25,549
introduction of you know more diverse

1159
00:49:22,190 --> 00:49:29,119
products is why because we have more

1160
00:49:25,550 --> 00:49:32,240
diverse people than ever before using

1161
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:35,389
cannabis for more diverse reasons than

1162
00:49:32,239 --> 00:49:39,109
ever before so you know it if you think

1163
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:41,779
about your 4th of July barbecue you know

1164
00:49:39,110 --> 00:49:44,480
you've got kids in the pool and the

1165
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:46,040
barbecues on and every adults in the

1166
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:49,099
yard is standing there with a beer in

1167
00:49:46,039 --> 00:49:50,449
their hand and at any point something

1168
00:49:49,099 --> 00:49:53,449
happens with one of the kids in the pool

1169
00:49:50,449 --> 00:49:54,799
you know any adult can drop the gear put

1170
00:49:53,449 --> 00:49:57,769
the kid in the car and get to the

1171
00:49:54,800 --> 00:50:01,370
emergency room but what is the

1172
00:49:57,769 --> 00:50:03,980
equivalent of cannabis right what what

1173
00:50:01,369 --> 00:50:05,779
what kind of cannabis is that I I can

1174
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:07,610
still drive and I can take my kids to

1175
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:10,310
the emergency room kind of cannabis what

1176
00:50:07,610 --> 00:50:12,860
is the you know Sunday afternoon hike

1177
00:50:10,309 --> 00:50:14,420
what is the 6 a.m. yoga before I have to

1178
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:17,180
go to work and be at my desk at 9:00

1179
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:19,099
a.m. you know there there are lots of

1180
00:50:17,179 --> 00:50:22,339
different kinds of people using cannabis

1181
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:25,489
for more reasons than ever before and it

1182
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:27,920
would make sense to produce lots of

1183
00:50:25,489 --> 00:50:31,879
diverse products which would fit all of

1184
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:33,650
those diverse mean yeah one question I

1185
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:34,849
forgot to ask you that I was thinking of

1186
00:50:33,650 --> 00:50:38,360
is did you see any difference between

1187
00:50:34,849 --> 00:50:40,549
outdoor versus indoor grown flower on

1188
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:42,579
these scales or is that something you

1189
00:50:40,550 --> 00:50:44,870
tracked and I know you haven't looked at

1190
00:50:42,579 --> 00:50:46,730
organic versus conventionally grown

1191
00:50:44,869 --> 00:50:50,449
cannabis but is that on the radar at all

1192
00:50:46,730 --> 00:50:52,519
either no honestly we don't really have

1193
00:50:50,449 --> 00:50:54,349
any interest in looking at

1194
00:50:52,519 --> 00:50:55,880
conventionally grown cannabis because we

1195
00:50:54,349 --> 00:50:57,949
believe that organically grown cannabis

1196
00:50:55,880 --> 00:51:00,050
is the right thing to do we believe that

1197
00:50:57,949 --> 00:51:02,299
you know this is better for the earth

1198
00:51:00,050 --> 00:51:03,860
it's better for the human so I don't

1199
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:07,039
foresee that we're going to be looking

1200
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:08,760
at conventionally grown cannabis we have

1201
00:51:07,039 --> 00:51:12,630
definitely looked at light

1202
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:15,960
but if I go back to those that the top

1203
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:18,450
ten you know the the most enjoyable -

1204
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:20,789
least enjoyable I believe the majority

1205
00:51:18,449 --> 00:51:23,009
of those were cultivated with

1206
00:51:20,789 --> 00:51:24,869
supplemental light so the way that we

1207
00:51:23,010 --> 00:51:27,000
ask the question is you know like this

1208
00:51:24,869 --> 00:51:29,159
could be any supplemental light so it

1209
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:31,889
could be in a greenhouse with with some

1210
00:51:29,159 --> 00:51:34,619
light but you know with a greenhouse we

1211
00:51:31,889 --> 00:51:36,750
also or a hoop house you often still get

1212
00:51:34,619 --> 00:51:39,960
the full spectrum that you know a Sun

1213
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:42,659
only flower would get so that's how

1214
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:45,500
that's how we differ things but yeah I

1215
00:51:42,659 --> 00:51:50,399
mean people like both indoor and outdoor

1216
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:53,039
ones you know equally it seems I can

1217
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:56,789
tell you from a phytochemical level we

1218
00:51:53,039 --> 00:52:01,279
we see the most diverse you know we tend

1219
00:51:56,789 --> 00:52:04,469
to see them the widest array of terpenes

1220
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:07,440
expressed by you know flowers that are

1221
00:52:04,469 --> 00:52:08,159
produced in the Sun that makes that

1222
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:10,889
makes sense

1223
00:52:08,159 --> 00:52:13,259
I could I could see that just based on

1224
00:52:10,889 --> 00:52:16,230
the spectrum analysis

1225
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:18,870
you mentioned cannabis and I'm gonna

1226
00:52:16,230 --> 00:52:22,139
mispronounce it hi Piper menses how do

1227
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:24,779
you how do you say that word yeah hyper

1228
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:26,969
hyper emesis have you seen any research

1229
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:30,120
to support what is causing this I've

1230
00:52:26,969 --> 00:52:32,639
heard people correlated supposedly with

1231
00:52:30,119 --> 00:52:34,139
as interacting a name and a variety of

1232
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:38,909
other things I've heard people blame it

1233
00:52:34,139 --> 00:52:40,980
on oh I can't remember there were there

1234
00:52:38,909 --> 00:52:44,909
a variety of things theories have you

1235
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:47,309
seen any actual reason yeah on this yeah

1236
00:52:44,909 --> 00:52:49,440
this is a very active field and I can

1237
00:52:47,309 --> 00:52:51,029
tell you 100% it comes from over

1238
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:53,789
stimulating the endogenous cannabinoids

1239
00:52:51,030 --> 00:52:56,790
system with cannabinoids it is not

1240
00:52:53,789 --> 00:52:58,559
related to toxins it's not related to

1241
00:52:56,789 --> 00:53:01,170
pesticides it's not a side effect of

1242
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:03,199
mean you know that that theory you know

1243
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:06,539
kind of went viral and it was very

1244
00:53:03,199 --> 00:53:09,359
widely adopted for a long time but you

1245
00:53:06,539 --> 00:53:11,940
know in looking at you know both of

1246
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:13,890
zooming in to the receptors where

1247
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:16,409
cannabinoids bind you know that's a

1248
00:53:13,889 --> 00:53:18,929
molecular level as well as everything

1249
00:53:16,409 --> 00:53:20,489
that's you know reported by physicians

1250
00:53:18,929 --> 00:53:22,849
in the emergency departments who are

1251
00:53:20,489 --> 00:53:25,039
treating these people who have hyper and

1252
00:53:22,849 --> 00:53:28,449
all of the evidence is pointing toward

1253
00:53:25,039 --> 00:53:29,989
this is a cannabinoid mediated effect

1254
00:53:28,449 --> 00:53:32,329
interacting with the endogenous

1255
00:53:29,989 --> 00:53:33,979
cannabinoids system so it seems to be

1256
00:53:32,329 --> 00:53:37,519
causing people that are extremely heavy

1257
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:39,650
users is it something that it builds up

1258
00:53:37,519 --> 00:53:41,480
over time and then think it can hit at

1259
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:43,160
any point or is there are there things

1260
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:46,579
that are triggering it for certain users

1261
00:53:43,159 --> 00:53:49,819
is it's not cultivar specific or related

1262
00:53:46,579 --> 00:53:52,340
in any way or anything like that you

1263
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:54,410
know I these are all excellent questions

1264
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:56,510
that I think we have some evidence to

1265
00:53:54,409 --> 00:53:59,779
support that yes you're absolutely right

1266
00:53:56,510 --> 00:54:01,340
this this tends to happen in heavy users

1267
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:05,300
you know people who use very frequently

1268
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:08,420
for very long periods of time we don't

1269
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:10,220
know exactly which molecules may be

1270
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:11,990
contributing or or that is you know

1271
00:54:10,219 --> 00:54:13,819
which team of ours or cultivars of

1272
00:54:11,989 --> 00:54:17,629
cannabis are contributing to this effect

1273
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:20,030
but you know it makes it makes sense

1274
00:54:17,630 --> 00:54:22,610
that a lot of these heavy users are

1275
00:54:20,030 --> 00:54:26,240
using very potent products and it's very

1276
00:54:22,610 --> 00:54:30,079
very likely that it is a THC mediated

1277
00:54:26,239 --> 00:54:32,389
effect and you know what how you could

1278
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:34,429
balance that risk with you know a more

1279
00:54:32,389 --> 00:54:37,190
diverse both of are a type two cultivar

1280
00:54:34,429 --> 00:54:38,569
that had more CBD totally unknown at

1281
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:40,280
this point and frankly it's going to be

1282
00:54:38,570 --> 00:54:42,440
a long time before we understand that

1283
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:44,420
because we need the federal guidelines

1284
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:46,579
to you know turn around so that we can

1285
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:48,920
do that kind of research and collect

1286
00:54:46,579 --> 00:54:50,840
that data you know in a controlled

1287
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:52,010
manner great well I'm glad we got to

1288
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:53,720
touch on that too because it's something

1289
00:54:52,010 --> 00:54:55,370
that's been in the back of my brain for

1290
00:54:53,719 --> 00:54:58,909
a while so it's good to hear some real

1291
00:54:55,369 --> 00:55:00,109
information on that but yeah I really

1292
00:54:58,909 --> 00:55:02,899
appreciate you coming on the show today

1293
00:55:00,110 --> 00:55:05,410
and sharing a lot of this cuz I think

1294
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:07,849
that I hope this is the direction of

1295
00:55:05,409 --> 00:55:09,559
cannabis consumption in the future and I

1296
00:55:07,849 --> 00:55:11,750
think we need these science-based tools

1297
00:55:09,559 --> 00:55:13,219
to really make informed decisions I know

1298
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:15,079
here in Washington we're not allowed to

1299
00:55:13,219 --> 00:55:17,269
even smell the flower so you really

1300
00:55:15,079 --> 00:55:19,759
don't even know we can't make that

1301
00:55:17,269 --> 00:55:23,150
correlation between smell and enjoyment

1302
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:24,050
like you mentioned so yeah was there

1303
00:55:23,150 --> 00:55:26,450
anything else you want to share with

1304
00:55:24,050 --> 00:55:29,690
listeners before before I let you go for

1305
00:55:26,449 --> 00:55:31,189
the day yeah I mean like I you know

1306
00:55:29,690 --> 00:55:33,110
briefly I think that what you've just

1307
00:55:31,190 --> 00:55:35,079
mentioned is a huge problem for

1308
00:55:33,110 --> 00:55:36,590
consumers you know here we have data

1309
00:55:35,079 --> 00:55:38,509
telling us

1310
00:55:36,590 --> 00:55:40,700
that this is the most important

1311
00:55:38,510 --> 00:55:43,310
indicator of an enjoyable experience an

1312
00:55:40,699 --> 00:55:46,159
aroma and yet you're completely

1313
00:55:43,309 --> 00:55:48,349
depriving the consumer of the ability to

1314
00:55:46,159 --> 00:55:51,049
make an informed decision and you're

1315
00:55:48,349 --> 00:55:53,449
forcing them to make a decision based on

1316
00:55:51,050 --> 00:55:56,140
potency which we know is bad because

1317
00:55:53,449 --> 00:55:59,719
potency promotes all of the health risks

1318
00:55:56,139 --> 00:56:01,699
so you know I I would love if your

1319
00:55:59,719 --> 00:56:03,230
regulators in Washington and in

1320
00:56:01,699 --> 00:56:05,239
California and in all those other

1321
00:56:03,230 --> 00:56:07,070
markets where you know consumers aren't

1322
00:56:05,239 --> 00:56:09,049
allowed to stand all the products you

1323
00:56:07,070 --> 00:56:10,940
know we need to be able to pass this

1324
00:56:09,050 --> 00:56:13,460
information on and say hey like this is

1325
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:16,250
a really important biological

1326
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:19,730
decision-making factor that it's not

1327
00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:20,599
fair to deprive the consumers of I mean

1328
00:56:19,730 --> 00:56:23,409
I would agree with that wouldn't be the

1329
00:56:20,599 --> 00:56:28,130
first time regulation got in the way of

1330
00:56:23,409 --> 00:56:31,250
things that made sense right yeah and

1331
00:56:28,130 --> 00:56:33,590
you know you mentioned odor and odor is

1332
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:38,059
another whole nother topic I feel like

1333
00:56:33,590 --> 00:56:39,470
because it is so complex and you

1334
00:56:38,059 --> 00:56:41,539
mentioned that there are even terpenes

1335
00:56:39,469 --> 00:56:43,849
that we aren't even measuring at this

1336
00:56:41,539 --> 00:56:46,539
point potentially or understanding like

1337
00:56:43,849 --> 00:56:49,400
with your allusion to hops

1338
00:56:46,539 --> 00:56:50,960
yeah and and not even necessarily

1339
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:53,869
terpenes you know there are other

1340
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:55,909
aromatic compounds that produce aromas

1341
00:56:53,869 --> 00:56:57,920
that are not terpenes you know so we

1342
00:56:55,909 --> 00:57:00,109
have aldehydes and ketones and other

1343
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:02,809
molecules that are present in hops and

1344
00:57:00,110 --> 00:57:05,390
in grapes and in roses and in cannabis

1345
00:57:02,809 --> 00:57:07,250
you know we have those other molecules

1346
00:57:05,389 --> 00:57:10,849
that produce aromas that are not

1347
00:57:07,250 --> 00:57:14,480
terpenes or terpenoids and nobody is

1348
00:57:10,849 --> 00:57:16,190
nobody is looking for those so and

1349
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:18,949
you're absolutely right that you know

1350
00:57:16,190 --> 00:57:21,530
the sensory component is a whole other

1351
00:57:18,949 --> 00:57:24,289
you know sixteen minute episode in and

1352
00:57:21,530 --> 00:57:27,830
of itself you know like what smells are

1353
00:57:24,289 --> 00:57:30,170
there and in what intensity and who can

1354
00:57:27,829 --> 00:57:32,389
who can differentiate between them and

1355
00:57:30,170 --> 00:57:34,690
who is sensitive to these smells and who

1356
00:57:32,389 --> 00:57:39,379
isn't and what is what is that more

1357
00:57:34,690 --> 00:57:41,570
rigorous relationship between the aroma

1358
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:44,079
and the experience this is yeah it's a

1359
00:57:41,570 --> 00:57:46,400
huge area of opportunity for exploration

1360
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:48,319
well I'm super grateful to have you on
