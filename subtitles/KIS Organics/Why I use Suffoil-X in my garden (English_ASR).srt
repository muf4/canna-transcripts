00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,318
hey guys Tad here with kiss Organics

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,519
Happy New Year I wanted to do a

3
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:08,879
follow-up post from last week talking

4
00:00:06,519 --> 00:00:11,678
about suff oil X so when I got these

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,519
plants in at the beginning of the cycle

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,079
uh they actually came in with thrips and

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:18,000
fungus knats and so I wanted to do

8
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,239
something to treat for that and this is

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,518
a good idea anyway even if you don't

10
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:24,000
have any pests that you know about um

11
00:00:22,518 --> 00:00:26,799
just as a preventative because a lot of

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,599
times you can't see them so uh in this

13
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,759
case I use suff oil X and I applied it

14
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,399
three times a couple days apart to help

15
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:37,719
break the insect life cycle and then I

16
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:41,200
followed that up with some beneficial

17
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:42,679
insects and beneficial nematodes so I

18
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,679
want to talk a little bit about why I

19
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:46,280
choose to use this product in my garden

20
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:49,359
so first and foremost I just want to say

21
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:51,280
I'm not sponsored by uh these companies

22
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:52,839
I by St oilx I don't make any money I

23
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,160
don't sell the product I just think it's

24
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:57,600
a great product and uh it comes

25
00:00:55,159 --> 00:01:00,038
recommended to me by a good friend of

26
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,640
mine Suzanne way W Evans she is the

27
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:05,000
anist when it comes to the canvas

28
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,599
industry and other Horticultural crops

29
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,118
um you should absolutely be giving her a

30
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:13,640
follow um you can check her out buglady

31
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:18,039
suzan here on Instagram so suff X is

32
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:20,400
also available as montere horticultural

33
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:22,400
oil uh I picked this up online because

34
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,040
my local Home Depot didn't have it but

35
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,400
you can probably find this at a garden

36
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,439
center um or somewhere locally if not

37
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,000
it's widely available online it's going

38
00:01:28,438 --> 00:01:32,679
to run you $15 or $20 for something this

39
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,799
size and when you have a small garden

40
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:37,600
like me you know there's only 12 plants

41
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:40,159
here I don't need a huge bottle of suff

42
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:42,280
oil X so I'll be referring to a suff oil

43
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,840
X for video but it's Montery Garden

44
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:46,239
horticultural oil

45
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:50,520
too good pointer if you're looking for a

46
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:52,599
smaller size so why this product well

47
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:56,798
it's a it works on a wide variety of

48
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:58,959
insects um it controls AIDS uh mites

49
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,159
soft bodied insects uh they're all on

50
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:03,319
the label uh in addition it helps with

51
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:06,439
things like scale and powdery mildew it

52
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:08,799
works as a suffocant for insects meaning

53
00:02:06,438 --> 00:02:12,000
they can't develop a resistance to it

54
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,640
and it works for fungus by uh not

55
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,360
allowing them to attach to the leaf

56
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:18,479
surface so very very effective kind of

57
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:22,080
your all-in-one spray

58
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:24,399
for uh fungus issues and for pest so

59
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,319
that's one reason I like it right there

60
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:30,200
it is EPA registered and arm relisted um

61
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:34,039
so it's been approved in for use organic

62
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:36,318
production since 2009 and um because it

63
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:38,639
is EPA registered the company had to

64
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:41,280
show a lot of research regarding

65
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:43,199
efficacy on the product now a lot of

66
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,640
products on the market fall under an

67
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:47,119
exemption called 25b that doesn't mean

68
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:48,679
that they're good or bad it just means

69
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,719
that they don't have they don't have the

70
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:56,159
same regulation or um research

71
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:58,000
supporting their use in agriculture so

72
00:02:56,158 --> 00:03:02,840
those are things with like th oil in

73
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,360
them Rosemary um lavender mint those

74
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,840
sorts of those sorts of oilbased

75
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,519
products so they don't have to show that

76
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,280
the product works they don't have to

77
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:13,120
show that uh you know what levels are

78
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,799
safe in regards to

79
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,400
phytotoxicity um they they just the the

80
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:21,519
ingredients are considered generally

81
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,360
safe for uh human use or for

82
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,840
agricultural use so um they just don't

83
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,000
have to provide the same level of data

84
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,080
so when we talk about uh being a

85
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,120
science-based company ourselves we want

86
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,799
to use products that have the highest

87
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:36,360
level of research and data to support

88
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:39,599
their use so um that's one reason I

89
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:41,519
really I really do like this product now

90
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:44,079
um one of the other reasons I like this

91
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,959
product is because of the way they

92
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:51,239
emulsify it it makes it really really

93
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:53,840
easy to apply and I'm able to use lower

94
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:56,039
amounts of oil relative to other

95
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,519
oilbased products because of the

96
00:03:56,039 --> 00:04:00,840
emulsifier in here keeps the droplets

97
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:03,519
smaller so it's better at suffocating

98
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:09,000
insects than other products um it has a

99
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:11,799
very low REI level or REI at uh 4 hours

100
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,039
so the return inval is quite low

101
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:18,120
um according to everything I can find

102
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:20,879
online it's very safe it's

103
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,840
non-toxic and um the MSDS which I was

104
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:24,478
reading this morning uh really doesn't

105
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:26,239
show much of anything I mean you don't

106
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:28,399
want to consume it you don't want to get

107
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,639
in your eyes I always wear a respirator

108
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:32,839
anytime I spray um and I I highly

109
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:35,560
recommend that for everyone but in

110
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:37,439
general it's a very safe product um we

111
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:39,720
don't always have that same level of

112
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:42,839
information about a lot of the 25b

113
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:45,759
products out there and and one one

114
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:48,239
person commented on my Instagram that uh

115
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,680
they were worried about the fact that a

116
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,120
lab claimed that it lasts for 90 days

117
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:55,519
the residue of suox lasts on the leaf

118
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,280
surface I could not find any information

119
00:04:55,519 --> 00:05:00,359
about that online um if someone has that

120
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:02,638
data I would love to see it

121
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,960
uh but I don't spray Stu oil X and flour

122
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:09,280
anyway so as you can see

123
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:11,638
now I'm in the flour I have pistols and

124
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:13,679
I'm not going to be spraying really

125
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:15,840
anything on this crop uh from here until

126
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,560
finish if I saw something pop up at this

127
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:20,159
point I'm going to um I'm going to be

128
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,600
bringing in beneficial insects to deal

129
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,560
with it but as you can see the plants

130
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,720
look great and you know as long as I'm

131
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,079
not spraying onto the pistols themselves

132
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,919
I I really don't see any risk I don't

133
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:32,839
first of all I don't really believe that

134
00:05:30,918 --> 00:05:35,359
there is a lot of residue on these

135
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:38,159
leaves um from everything I can see with

136
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,720
SE oil has very low residue in general

137
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,080
but um even if there was on some of

138
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:44,199
these older fan leaves you know I'm not

139
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:45,839
going to be processing or consuming this

140
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:46,960
so I don't really see any risk there

141
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:49,679
there's not going to be anything on the

142
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:51,799
buds themselves so uh that's another

143
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:55,160
reason why I think it's perfectly okay

144
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:56,759
to use seoil x so just to highlight the

145
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,560
difference between seoil X and some of

146
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:59,840
these other products that I'm spraying

147
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,319
um suff oil X is going going to be sort

148
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:05,679
of an all-in-one uh Silver Bullet in a

149
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:09,759
lot of ways for most pests and

150
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:11,800
pathogens it's very very safe it's uh

151
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:15,598
allowed for use in organic production

152
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:18,840
and I don't have to worry about um

153
00:06:15,598 --> 00:06:20,519
phytotoxicity efficacy um residual

154
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:22,439
things like one of the things that

155
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:25,560
Suzanne talks about talked about on the

156
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:27,680
podcast is with neem oil the uh residue

157
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:29,439
from the neem oil on the leaf surface

158
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,720
itself will actually prevent benefit

159
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:34,598
beneficials from returning to that leaf

160
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:36,479
so so pest may get back in there before

161
00:06:34,598 --> 00:06:38,639
the beneficials do so that's a risk

162
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:41,199
associated with using NE oil versus

163
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:43,478
using um suff oil X

164
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,520
