00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:12,119
hey guys Tad here with kiss Organics and

3
00:00:09,558 --> 00:00:14,678
today I'm here to show you an unboxing

4
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:16,600
of the newest Light from bios lighting

5
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:19,480
this is the Luna

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:22,080
1750 now now for those of you less

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:25,079
familiar with bios bios is a NASA

8
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:27,358
spin-off founded in 2014 on the Florida

9
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:29,518
Space Coast originating from projects at

10
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,399
the space Life Sciences lab and Kennedy

11
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:34,479
Center to grow plants in space and help

12
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,558
astronauts regulate their sleep on the

13
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:39,959
International Space

14
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:41,799
Center if you haven't had a chance you

15
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,079
can check out my review of the BIOS

16
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:46,000
Endeavor multibar light on our YouTube

17
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,079
channel I've been running it in my

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,359
garden and I love how little it weighs

19
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,399
making it easy to hang and adjust and

20
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:54,960
the light output and uniformity is

21
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:57,039
excellent I've gotten solid yields with

22
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,600
good turine expression across multiple

23
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:03,198
harvests and bios uses the same Spectrum

24
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:06,560
in their Endeavor and Luna

25
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:09,000
lights today they use these discoveries

26
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,759
to revolutionize lighting for human

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,280
wellness and growing plants on Earth

28
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:15,439
I've worked with a lot of different LED

29
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,400
companies over the years and now I work

30
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:19,798
exclusively with bios for a few reasons

31
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,600
uh first and foremost is because I

32
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:24,560
believe they have one of the best lights

33
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:27,199
commercially available on the market in

34
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,079
terms of build quality you really see

35
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,719
that NASA engineering coming through and

36
00:01:29,078 --> 00:01:33,519
the quality of the lighting they're

37
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:35,519
producing and they also have the best

38
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:37,719
customer service of any Lighting Company

39
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:40,359
I've ever worked with uh in addition to

40
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:42,959
that they have the best warranty that's

41
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:45,478
out there on the market today a 7-year

42
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:48,879
warranty on the fixture and a 5-year

43
00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:50,438
warranty on the power supply but let's

44
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:53,319
Okay so let's get into the specs on the

45
00:01:50,438 --> 00:01:56,118
light the light works on a range of 120

46
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:59,639
to 277 volts or you can get a different

47
00:01:56,118 --> 00:02:00,640
power supply that works on 277 to 488

48
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,039
volts

49
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,840
the fixture is approximately 38 in Long

50
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:08,560
by 4 1/2 in wide and 4 in tall and

51
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,319
weighs 12.2 lb the power supply can be

52
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,120
mounted next to the fixture or further

53
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:16,318
away using a jumper cable and it weighs

54
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:19,759
7.4 lb the light is 635 Watts with a par

55
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:23,639
efficacy of 2.76 U moles per second and

56
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:25,239
a ppf of 1750 U moles per second the

57
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:27,119
housing on the light is cold forged

58
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:28,959
aluminum and tempered glass over the

59
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,319
diodes so you can easily wipe them down

60
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:34,280
and clean them this is crucial not only

61
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:36,359
for IPM but also to maintain efficacy

62
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:38,439
lights without glass coverings May list

63
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,200
slightly better efficacy but in everyday

64
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:42,239
usage I would expect it to drop quickly

65
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:44,598
as the diodes become dirty or Dusty and

66
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:48,080
you cannot clean them effectively the

67
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:50,598
light also has an ip66 waterproof rating

68
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,800
an ip66 rating is protected against

69
00:02:50,598 --> 00:02:54,158
multi-directional High Press water so

70
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,920
you don't have to worry about damaging

71
00:02:54,158 --> 00:02:57,719
your light when spraying and it's easy

72
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:00,559
to clean and it's the highest rating a

73
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:02,639
fixture can have bios C customizes both

74
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,000
the cabling and the lighting layout

75
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:05,598
because everyone has a slightly

76
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,959
different grow environment if you

77
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:08,518
contact me directly through kiss

78
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,920
Organics we can get you a custom

79
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:12,120
lighting layout that would show you how

80
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:13,759
the lights potentially overlap and what

81
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,360
sort of homogeneity you would have

82
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:16,359
throughout your

83
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:22,200
canopy okay so I wanted to shoot a quick

84
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:25,000
video showing you how easy it is to hang

85
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:26,439
the light because it weighs so little I

86
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,598
can hold it with one hand while

87
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:31,039
attaching the hangers and then the Quick

88
00:03:28,598 --> 00:03:32,878
Connect cables uh they just snap in and

89
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:34,919
do a half twist to ensure a solid

90
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:36,959
electrical connection with no risk of

91
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:40,158
them coming apart it's literally plug

92
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:42,719
andplay right out of the

93
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:45,318
box all right so now we are back in the

94
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:47,400
grow room I have the lights hung up I

95
00:03:45,318 --> 00:03:49,238
have the Luna and I hung it up next to

96
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,319
the Endeavor so that you could see the

97
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:53,000
two side by side both of these lights

98
00:03:51,318 --> 00:03:54,518
are from bios and the Endeavor I'd

99
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,158
already did an unboxing video of that

100
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:58,480
you can check out on our YouTube channel

101
00:03:57,158 --> 00:04:00,598
um you would never really run these

102
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:02,598
lights side to side by side you choose

103
00:04:00,598 --> 00:04:04,119
one design or the other but I did want

104
00:04:02,598 --> 00:04:06,560
to show you what they look like next to

105
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:09,400
each other now in terms of the light

106
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,719
itself um I'll post on the video here

107
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,599
I'll show you what the actual lighting

108
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:16,519
layout is but just checking it with my

109
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:19,079
par meter right now um as we start up

110
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:22,280
close to the light here we're up to 3200

111
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:24,840
uh ppfd and then as we come down now I'm

112
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:27,159
at about 2,000 right about here directly

113
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:28,439
under the light and then as I move away

114
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,199
we're going to see those light levels

115
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:33,120
drop as that angle changes to too so

116
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:35,680
even at this distance we're at about a

117
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,720
th000 ppfd here and as we move out

118
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:42,000
towards the edge of the bed here at an

119
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,919
angle if I angle more meter we're about

120
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,759
550 uh

121
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:49,478
ppfd so we're getting quite High light

122
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:51,520
levels uh with the Luna and we're

123
00:04:49,478 --> 00:04:53,800
getting it with a very slim form factor

124
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:55,319
so it's not going to block any light

125
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,160
coming in from the Sun say in a

126
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:58,918
greenhouse and we can also pack these

127
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:03,400
closer together if you wanted to hit a

128
00:04:58,918 --> 00:05:05,038
higher overall uh ppfd in your grow

129
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:07,799
thanks for watching my review of the

130
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:09,639
Luna LED grow light from bios lighting

131
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,520
please reach out to either myself or

132
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:13,319
bios if you have any questions or

133
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:17,359
interested in a custom lighting layout

134
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:17,360
for your garden or facility
