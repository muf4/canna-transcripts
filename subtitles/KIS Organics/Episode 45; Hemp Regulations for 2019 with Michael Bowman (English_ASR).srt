with everything going on right now

47
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,950
around him I thought it was the perfect

48
00:01:54,269 --> 00:01:57,509
time to get him on the show to answer

49
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:00,450
some questions about what to expect in

50
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:02,280
2019 I brought on Nelson Lindsley from

51
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:04,500
poetry of plants to assist me in the

52
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,149
interview some of the audio quality of

53
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,068
this taping wasn't as good as I would

54
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:09,330
have liked so apologies in advance for

55
00:02:08,068 --> 00:02:16,079
some of the background noise

56
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:17,190

00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:30,509
help with the interview thanks dad yeah

62
00:02:29,009 --> 00:02:32,609
so Michael I really wanted to start out

63
00:02:30,509 --> 00:02:34,669
just talking a little bit about your

64
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:37,950
personal background and how you got into

65
00:02:34,669 --> 00:02:41,269
everything that you're doing now well

66
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:43,379
well thanks dad I am a fifth generation

67
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:45,330
Colorado and I grew up on our family's

68
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:48,180
farming and ranching operation on the

69
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:50,430
eastern plains and after college spent a

70
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,780
couple of decades full-time with the

71
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:53,730
family farm we had a rather large

72
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:55,800
operation but I was always interested in

73
00:02:53,729 --> 00:02:58,590
sustainability and the environment and

74
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:01,290
and rural development and technology and

75
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:04,379
all that Nexus of things that that kind

76
00:03:01,289 --> 00:03:07,469
of keep us on the cutting edge of you

77
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:08,939
know what's next in agriculture and then

78
00:03:07,469 --> 00:03:11,009
we were plagued by the fact that our

79
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:14,489
operation was over the overall aquifer

80
00:03:11,009 --> 00:03:17,609
where we grew a lot of grew and grow a

81
00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:20,580
lot of corn in and that an entire

82
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:22,470
aquifers you might know as one of the

83
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:25,860
largest underground aquifers in the

84
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:30,330
world and we run sustainably depleting

85
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:32,610
it to grow corn predominantly in a way

86
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:35,219
that in under a kind of an economic

87
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:37,260
model where it was it may be one of the

88
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:39,900
worst economic models ever devised were

89
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:42,810
fully fossil water from the ground with

90
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:45,870
coal-fired power from Wyoming to produce

91
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:47,459
a crop that needed that still needs to

92
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:49,379
be subsidized by the federal government

93
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:52,890
it is it is it is of absolutely a house

94
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:54,209
of cards that we've set up and so I was

95
00:03:52,889 --> 00:03:56,399
always interested in you know what's

96
00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:58,229
next how do we how do we transition from

97
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,080
corn to something else how do we keep

98
00:03:58,229 --> 00:04:02,639
our rural communities viable you know

99
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:05,160
what's that next what's what's the next

100
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:07,409
magic trick to to help us get better or

101
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:10,169
what we do and at that time and this was

102
00:04:07,409 --> 00:04:11,909
in the late 90s and early 2000s I was

103
00:04:10,169 --> 00:04:14,969
spending a lot of time in Zimbabwe with

104
00:04:11,909 --> 00:04:17,069
Allan savory on on soils management soil

105
00:04:14,969 --> 00:04:18,930
carbon was it interested me a lot in its

106
00:04:17,069 --> 00:04:21,269
play and you know in absorbing

107
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:23,069
atmospheric carbon was with with good a

108
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:26,430
great organic content and

109
00:04:23,069 --> 00:04:28,230
and and such and in those days you could

110
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:30,449
say you could talk about carbon sink or

111
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:32,850
carbon absorption and mostly get blank

112
00:04:30,449 --> 00:04:35,219
stares from everybody but I happened to

113
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:36,689
be in the Bob way one trip and we were

114
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:39,200
sitting around a campfire one night and

115
00:04:36,689 --> 00:04:41,490
an Australian couple came through and

116
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,959
they had just been in India of where

117
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:46,710
they were talking about this transition

118
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:50,219
from hemp economy basically have based

119
00:04:46,709 --> 00:04:51,689
economy to GMO cotton and all the

120
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,370
struggles of the farmers were going

121
00:04:51,689 --> 00:04:55,800
through and the trouble they were having

122
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:57,030
taking the centuries-old practice and

123
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,069
what they were doing in the industrial

124
00:04:57,029 --> 00:05:02,309
had been moving into this chemically

125
00:04:59,069 --> 00:05:04,589
based world and at that time they were

126
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:06,329
and still are there was a lot of

127
00:05:04,589 --> 00:05:10,919
suicides happening in the farm country

128
00:05:06,329 --> 00:05:12,750
because of because what was happening in

129
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:16,140
that society when you can't take care of

130
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:17,370
your family financially you there's

131
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:19,469
there's an honour killer there's an

132
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:21,209
honour suicide and there is something

133
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:23,490
over over two hundred thousand farmers

134
00:05:21,209 --> 00:05:27,149
today that have committed suicide that

135
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:28,710
are generally related to this trend this

136
00:05:27,149 --> 00:05:30,899
change this transition and they were

137
00:05:28,709 --> 00:05:32,819
doing it and as many of them are doing

138
00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:33,899
it by drinking the very chemicals

139
00:05:32,819 --> 00:05:35,670
they're being forced to put on their

140
00:05:33,899 --> 00:05:38,039
land for the first time ever and so I

141
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:39,660
came at this from initially from from a

142
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,430
kind of a social justice warrior

143
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:43,200
perspectives like this is just wrong we

144
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:46,410
got a you know we need to figure out

145
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:49,019
what what's happening here and then as I

146
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:50,970
wandered through that that history and

147
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:53,519
the story and the industrial hemp plant

148
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:55,680
I became obsessed with the plant and I

149
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:57,779
keep in mind our farm was in the in the

150
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,370
central Great Plains we were far enough

151
00:05:57,779 --> 00:06:02,489
West that they were just breaking out

152
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:04,350
Prairie and starting to farm about the

153
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:08,430
time prohibition was in place so it

154
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:10,860
wouldn't place in 37 so industrial hemp

155
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:12,629
farming never made it as far west so I

156
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:15,840
was you know he's never introduced to

157
00:06:12,629 --> 00:06:17,790
the to the plant and then as I learned

158
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:20,729
about the plant and it's you know and

159
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:22,650
it's need easily something that's

160
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:24,540
environmentally benign and something

161
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:25,979
that could that had thousands of

162
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:28,220
products it can be made from the plant

163
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:30,870
and and could be drought tolerance

164
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:32,760
checking every box for me is like okay

165
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:34,949
that why aren't you know why aren't we

166
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:36,539
in the United States doing that went

167
00:06:34,949 --> 00:06:38,579
back and studied the

168
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:41,790
three of the Prohibition and what

169
00:06:38,579 --> 00:06:43,469
happened in 37 then through 1970 with

170
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:46,260
with Nixon and and the Controlled

171
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:48,240
Substances Act and and then got really

172
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:50,969
fired up about the policy side of it I'd

173
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,069
done a lot of work in in in DC and

174
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:54,690
continued to do so around environment

175
00:06:53,069 --> 00:06:56,790
sustainability over the last couple of

176
00:06:54,689 --> 00:06:58,439
decades so I was no stranger to

177
00:06:56,790 --> 00:07:02,040
Washington and no stranger to state

178
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:04,310
politics as well and so started my

179
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:09,689
journey in Colorado of educating people

180
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:12,360
about him from 2006 to 2010 I an another

181
00:07:09,689 --> 00:07:14,540
woman at Linda Parker and Denver did

182
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:17,220
quarterly meetings and reached out to

183
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:20,520
farmers and the Bar Association and

184
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:22,410
legislators and and regulators to talk

185
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:25,889
about this plant and why is it illegal

186
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:28,200
and could Colorado step up and it take

187
00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:32,939
be the tip of the spear runs on ending

188
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:35,389
this national prohibition and so 2011 we

189
00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:37,529
got our legislature to pass a resolution

190
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:41,329
unanimously supporting the

191
00:07:37,529 --> 00:07:44,129
reintroduction of the plant and 2000

192
00:07:41,329 --> 00:07:46,919
2012 and we got our legislature to pass

193
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:48,659
a fight or phytoremediation bail a small

194
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:52,080
one that cara state university could

195
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:54,180
play and after the forest fires kind of

196
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:56,069
reclaiming some soil from from the vast

197
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:59,970
fires we'd had the summer before and

198
00:07:56,069 --> 00:08:02,879
then in course in 2012 the fall of 2012

199
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:05,700
we passed our historic amendment 64

200
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,949
which ended prohibition and of the plant

201
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:11,279
in its entirety from recreational adult

202
00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:14,639
use to industrial hemp farming so we

203
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:16,829
took our we scored that as our win you

204
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,709
know a washington state legalized that

205
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:21,539
same night where a time zone ahead so we

206
00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:23,189
like to say we did it first but we did

207
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:26,100
it believe yeah we did it to say we did

208
00:08:23,189 --> 00:08:29,160
it the same night and and off we went

209
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:30,780
and formed a national organization the

210
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:33,060
National Association of which I was a

211
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:34,799
founding board chair and and worked on

212
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:36,869
worked at both a federal level and state

213
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:38,939
levels then on getting states to

214
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:41,310
legalize so today the from that night in

215
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:43,590
in November of 12 in Colorado and

216
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:48,329
Washington I legalized we've gone from

217
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:50,399
to that evening to 41 today in this in

218
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:53,400
the late

219
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:55,829
late late May early June of 2013 I wrote

220
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:57,209
some language and took it to then

221
00:08:55,830 --> 00:09:00,570
congressman polis it was now the

222
00:08:57,210 --> 00:09:02,550
governor of Colorado and asked if he

223
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:04,650
would consider including that some the

224
00:09:02,549 --> 00:09:07,649
amendment process for the then house

225
00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:12,929
language for the 2013 which became the

226
00:09:07,649 --> 00:09:15,720
2014 farm bill that that became section

227
00:09:12,929 --> 00:09:19,679
7 606 which was the the amendment that

228
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:23,220
really opened the door for this industry

229
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:24,929
to to you know is to start doing what it

230
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:27,389
does best innovating and growing and

231
00:09:24,929 --> 00:09:30,809
creating opportunities and so as you see

232
00:09:27,389 --> 00:09:33,899
now over the last five years seven six

233
00:09:30,809 --> 00:09:37,109
oh six by opening that door is we've

234
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:40,620
created the beginnings I think of a you

235
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:42,810
know a substantial and lasting industry

236
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:46,740
in the country I think last year we had

237
00:09:42,809 --> 00:09:49,889
about seventy five thousand acres us

238
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:53,519
wide in the in the inner space and then

239
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:54,779
of course the the recent farm bill that

240
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,299
was signed about a little over a month

241
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:58,500
ago these schedules the plants and does

242
00:09:57,299 --> 00:10:01,169
a number of other things along with that

243
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:03,659
language so I think we're we're well out

244
00:10:01,169 --> 00:10:05,339
of the barn now and and looking forward

245
00:10:03,659 --> 00:10:09,120
to you know creating these opportunities

246
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:10,980
and and and letting America get into a

247
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,659
place again where we can lead in

248
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:15,210
production and development of products

249
00:10:12,659 --> 00:10:17,100
and job creation and all the things we

250
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:20,910
can do well when when when we have good

251
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:23,850
policy in place so what can we expect

252
00:10:20,909 --> 00:10:26,519
for this year with the addition of the

253
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:29,850
2018 farm bill what are you seeing out

254
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:32,519
there well I think there's there's a

255
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:34,320
there's some irrational exuberance about

256
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:36,210
where we are not about the plants

257
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,480
potential or where we're going to go but

258
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:42,570
really where we are as an industry for

259
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:45,060
the the farm bill you know we still have

260
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:47,340
a process that has to be put in place by

261
00:10:45,059 --> 00:10:50,039
the feds federal standards state plans

262
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:51,690
being approved and such and keep in mind

263
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:54,179
the government went in to shut down the

264
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:55,770
day after the farm bill was signed so

265
00:10:54,179 --> 00:10:58,349
nothing has been done

266
00:10:55,769 --> 00:11:00,509
per the prescriptive remedies in the in

267
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:03,720
the in the farm bill so we still have to

268
00:11:00,509 --> 00:11:04,100
get you'll get those done the state said

269
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,720
that our

270
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:08,209
illegal will be in the process of

271
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:10,910
putting you're submitting plan to the to

272
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:12,559
the USDA those that aren't legal are

273
00:11:10,909 --> 00:11:15,469
going to have to step up you know this

274
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:16,909
session and they don't well they don't

275
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:19,490
have to do anything but their

276
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:21,889
opportunity to step up legalize and let

277
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:24,740
their farmers be in the game you know

278
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:26,509
I'm in Iowa today and tomorrow and

279
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:28,639
Iowa's one of the nine that has not

280
00:11:26,509 --> 00:11:31,100
legalized much to the chagrin of many of

281
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:34,100
the producers here in the state so we're

282
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:35,889
going to be you know trying to tease out

283
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:38,000
those those legislators who have been

284
00:11:35,889 --> 00:11:41,750
somewhat reluctant to step into this

285
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,669
space and and get them in the in a

286
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:46,129
position of support and I'm going to be

287
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:48,559
talking to a conference of over 900 land

288
00:11:46,129 --> 00:11:49,879
managers in the u.s. tomorrow who

289
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:52,969
control a lot of land in the United

290
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:55,250
States that are interested in in this is

291
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:56,778
a viable third crop a new rotation and

292
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:58,429
you know and frankly if we're gonna if

293
00:11:56,778 --> 00:12:00,679
we're going to take this industry to the

294
00:11:58,429 --> 00:12:03,979
you know to the fiber and bio plastics

295
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:06,739
and and in composites world and

296
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:09,560
hempcrete and the things that that we

297
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:11,360
know that spine is very good at you know

298
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:13,399
we're gonna have to get to a scale and

299
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,339
acreage that that's far beyond where we

300
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:19,059
are today so I think 2019 is still going

301
00:12:16,339 --> 00:12:22,550
to be I mean I I still see this as a

302
00:12:19,059 --> 00:12:24,768
transition year they'll likely see again

303
00:12:22,549 --> 00:12:26,688
a bump in acreage but I don't think

304
00:12:24,769 --> 00:12:30,589
we're gonna see the you know the large

305
00:12:26,688 --> 00:12:32,778
increases until after until after this

306
00:12:30,589 --> 00:12:34,610
year because of some of the constraints

307
00:12:32,778 --> 00:12:36,818
that we that are you know still

308
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:39,680
practically in place

309
00:12:36,818 --> 00:12:43,159
Michael what's the biggest pushback

310
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:44,859
you're hearing from legislation and the

311
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:48,860
politicians are on the government scale

312
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:50,720
side of things to keep this from being

313
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:53,480
legal in all 50 states I mean that's a

314
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:56,170
curious thing for me is it directly

315
00:12:53,480 --> 00:13:00,860
related to cannabis or is well another

316
00:12:56,169 --> 00:13:03,559
yeah you know it's still a I think I'm

317
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:05,240
lingering the reefer madness here a lot

318
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:06,888
of it is generational if you've got if

319
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:09,879
you have a regulator or a legislator

320
00:13:06,889 --> 00:13:13,039
who's maybe in their 70s or early 80s

321
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:14,750
they really do believe that this is the

322
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:16,789
devil's lettuce you know no matter what

323
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,990
you say it doesn't matter what what it

324
00:13:16,789 --> 00:13:19,990
is

325
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:22,019
to them there is no distinction and in

326
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:24,190
fact interestingly enough in Hawaii

327
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:26,528
yesterday representative Cynthia Thielen

328
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:29,290
who's been a bulwark office she's just

329
00:13:26,528 --> 00:13:31,720
an incredible been incredible supporter

330
00:13:29,289 --> 00:13:35,289
of this industry over her years in the

331
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:37,959
Hawaii State Legislature had to put out

332
00:13:35,289 --> 00:13:39,819
a very terse press release to the

333
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:41,169
department to the Hawaii Department of

334
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:43,060
Agriculture's bill that they had

335
00:13:41,169 --> 00:13:45,729
submitted to the - they're just convene

336
00:13:43,059 --> 00:13:50,199
legislature where they still refer to it

337
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:53,550
as a scheduled substance and and and in

338
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:56,440
their case there's a very active DEA

339
00:13:53,549 --> 00:13:57,909
concern over there that that has that

340
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:01,300
has never liked the idea of legalizing

341
00:13:57,909 --> 00:14:02,799
hemp and so they're you know so that's

342
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:05,409
one case and the other and the other

343
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:08,559
case is I'd say in Iowa I think it's

344
00:14:05,409 --> 00:14:12,338
been a Senator Grassley has been very

345
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:14,489
slow to warm up to this idea and again I

346
00:14:12,339 --> 00:14:16,990
think that's for him that's generational

347
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:19,570
they do you know they they just believe

348
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:21,250
this is a slippery slope to you heroin

349
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:22,750
for babies you know the questions where

350
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:24,129
do we stop well you know well maybe you

351
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,958
stop somewhere between heroin for baby

352
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:27,490
you know I mean it's you know the jokes

353
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:29,469
gonna write themselves and then and then

354
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:31,028
I don't mean that is it it's not funny

355
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:33,660
because this is a serious issue when you

356
00:14:31,028 --> 00:14:36,429
were talking debating science but it is

357
00:14:33,659 --> 00:14:38,769
amusing that in you know twenty nineteen

358
00:14:36,429 --> 00:14:42,519
were still having science-based

359
00:14:38,769 --> 00:14:43,870
arguments on this plant sure one of the

360
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:46,299
things you mentioned was just sort of

361
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:47,919
maybe to mute the exuberance a little

362
00:14:46,299 --> 00:14:50,379
bit for 2019

363
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:52,328
that was something I heard a lot of from

364
00:14:50,379 --> 00:14:55,929
other policy experts around that are

365
00:14:52,328 --> 00:14:57,969
around hemp so if I'm understanding you

366
00:14:55,929 --> 00:14:59,979
correctly you're thinking that 2019 is

367
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:01,870
still going to be the year of getting

368
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:03,940
policy and regulation in place and it

369
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:05,860
probably won't be till 2020 or maybe

370
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:07,630
even later when you could it's really

371
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:09,070
gonna it's really gonna hit and we're

372
00:15:07,629 --> 00:15:12,278
gonna have this boom with industrial

373
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:13,839
hemp agreed I think we really are I

374
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:15,278
think we'll still see some growth in the

375
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,890
industry this year I think you know

376
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:21,879
we've we've seen sometimes two to three

377
00:15:17,889 --> 00:15:23,588
x growth year to year since 2014 so I we

378
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:26,230
will have some growth but but you know

379
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:29,680
frankly we don't have the infrastructure

380
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:30,909
in place to handle a large crop and what

381
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:32,979
we don't want to do is May

382
00:15:30,909 --> 00:15:35,439
the same mistake on a Canada did in

383
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:37,300
1998-99 where they opened the door let

384
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:41,019
the farmers you know the farmers grew

385
00:15:37,299 --> 00:15:42,309
you know a lot of acreage early on with

386
00:15:41,019 --> 00:15:45,129
really no market develop no

387
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:47,559
infrastructure to take that seed into a

388
00:15:45,129 --> 00:15:51,429
hemp heart or you know the the stock

389
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:53,619
into into a fiber or herd and and and so

390
00:15:51,429 --> 00:15:57,549
we've got that we've we've got to have

391
00:15:53,620 --> 00:16:01,328
it this isn't all hands on deck you know

392
00:15:57,549 --> 00:16:03,789
opportunities last challenge here to to

393
00:16:01,328 --> 00:16:06,278
bring you know private private interests

394
00:16:03,789 --> 00:16:09,219
and and money and government and policy

395
00:16:06,278 --> 00:16:10,929
and farmers together to build us out i I

396
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:12,310
think we can do it quickly with the

397
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:14,309
right but with the right partners but

398
00:16:12,309 --> 00:16:17,679
again we you know we have a lot of

399
00:16:14,309 --> 00:16:20,198
probably the most the largest void and

400
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:23,769
all of this is the the lack of

401
00:16:20,198 --> 00:16:26,859
infrastructure so one other question

402
00:16:23,769 --> 00:16:29,560
I've I had is I've heard a lot of issues

403
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:32,259
around cross pollination with type 1

404
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:34,388
plants a lot of concern from cannabis

405
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:36,339
growers that are growing high THC plants

406
00:16:34,389 --> 00:16:40,750
with this idea of industrial hemp taking

407
00:16:36,339 --> 00:16:43,269
off and poor regulation on the part of

408
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:46,120
farmers will cause you know them to ruin

409
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:48,639
a lot of sense of mere crops well that

410
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:50,470
is a you know that is a valid concern we

411
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:53,230
had to deal with that in Colorado early

412
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:54,459
on south color southern Colorado and

413
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:58,209
your Pueblo where there was a lot of

414
00:16:54,458 --> 00:17:00,938
both outdoor marijuana grows and hemp

415
00:16:58,208 --> 00:17:02,588
and in that case you know I think under

416
00:17:00,938 --> 00:17:04,750
the threat of the the county and state

417
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:07,568
you know instituting regulations they've

418
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:09,189
self regulated I know in Oregon I think

419
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:10,899
they if I remember right that the first

420
00:17:09,189 --> 00:17:12,308
year they canceled that industrial had

421
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,990
program the first year because of some

422
00:17:12,308 --> 00:17:17,588
of the most concerns of the established

423
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:19,179
type one grower so I think that those

424
00:17:17,588 --> 00:17:20,889
are valid concerns that those are

425
00:17:19,179 --> 00:17:24,069
concerns in Hawaii they're frankly going

426
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:26,980
to be concerns in a lot of places if not

427
00:17:24,068 --> 00:17:28,328
everywhere and so those that's one of

428
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,710
the you know that is that is one of the

429
00:17:28,328 --> 00:17:32,408
issues we're really going to have to

430
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:33,909
look at carefully and and you keep

431
00:17:32,409 --> 00:17:37,059
everybody informed on that because we

432
00:17:33,909 --> 00:17:39,100
the last thing we want is a in and then

433
00:17:37,058 --> 00:17:41,500
the possibility of a train wreck where

434
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:42,609
we have you know people permitted to do

435
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,750
type 1 and type 2

436
00:17:42,609 --> 00:17:48,288
you know offense the offense or defense

437
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:51,500
here so we've got to incorporate that

438
00:17:48,288 --> 00:17:55,460
that can it's real so is the solution

439
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:57,558
right now regulation around locations so

440
00:17:55,460 --> 00:18:00,288
that making sure say for example that

441
00:17:57,558 --> 00:18:02,750
any industrial hemp is going to be at

442
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:06,579
least five miles or whatever distance is

443
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:10,308
deemed appropriate from say pre-existing

444
00:18:06,579 --> 00:18:12,109
type one cultivation locations I think

445
00:18:10,308 --> 00:18:15,349
at the very least is going to take some

446
00:18:12,109 --> 00:18:18,168
you know the state regulators to be able

447
00:18:15,349 --> 00:18:19,579
to map this and be able to you know what

448
00:18:18,169 --> 00:18:23,559
would I know an application is received

449
00:18:19,579 --> 00:18:25,220
to you know either either respond or

450
00:18:23,558 --> 00:18:26,329
because I think it's going to be a

451
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,620
little messy in the in the beginning

452
00:18:26,329 --> 00:18:33,288
because there's going to be a rush of

453
00:18:27,619 --> 00:18:37,038
permits you know for for this and in the

454
00:18:33,288 --> 00:18:40,158
lack of a state or county regulatory

455
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:42,440
framework is going to is going what

456
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:43,640
we're gonna do I think we'd almost be

457
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,048
assured we're gonna have a couple train

458
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,580
wrecks to the shooter and then I mean

459
00:18:45,048 --> 00:18:49,460
large ones but we're gonna we're gonna

460
00:18:46,579 --> 00:18:52,759
have this collision somewhere some well

461
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:55,400
how some way because there just isn't

462
00:18:52,759 --> 00:18:59,480
you know enough oversight in place to at

463
00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:03,288
least even just alert the folks you know

464
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:07,099
what's happening in their backyard oh so

465
00:19:03,288 --> 00:19:09,230
you think that some legal growers in

466
00:19:07,099 --> 00:19:11,178
states are going to get hit with pollen

467
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:13,038
just out of the blue at some point

468
00:19:11,179 --> 00:19:14,809
unaware that there was even have going

469
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:16,669
on in their area is that is that the

470
00:19:14,808 --> 00:19:18,558
concern that you're raising I do think

471
00:19:16,669 --> 00:19:20,390
yes I do think that that's exactly the

472
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:22,579
like the case tab that there will be

473
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:24,080
there will be some you know unintended

474
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:26,658
these aren't going to be you know a

475
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:28,849
purposeful plants and and nobody's doing

476
00:19:26,659 --> 00:19:32,480
that job to you to purposely harm

477
00:19:28,849 --> 00:19:34,668
another but I I can imagine that we will

478
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,579
have that scenario in more than one

479
00:19:34,669 --> 00:19:39,830
place in nineteen teaching direction on

480
00:19:37,579 --> 00:19:41,869
the genetic side where are you finding

481
00:19:39,829 --> 00:19:44,449
most most people are sourcing seed and

482
00:19:41,869 --> 00:19:48,229
are you seeing any particular cultivars

483
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:52,058
being more highly sourced or cultivated

484
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:54,470
than others at this point in time well

485
00:19:52,058 --> 00:19:56,629
most of the seat for the traditional

486
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:58,490
grows I would say just from my

487
00:19:56,630 --> 00:20:00,980
experience it

488
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:03,679
mean out of can another X X 59 seems to

489
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:06,920
be you know very popular I know there's

490
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:09,610
some there's a company bringing in seeds

491
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:12,289
now from from Eastern or Western Europe

492
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:15,949
that they believe will be the wool you

493
00:20:12,289 --> 00:20:18,470
won't get hot so and that we're gonna

494
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:20,660
see a lot of that until we get you know

495
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:22,880
more certified seed in place more more

496
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:25,450
of our own genetics in place of course

497
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:30,890
Colorado's come a hot bed right now for

498
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:33,140
genetic work see genetics and and so on

499
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:34,790
and but but you all be all everything is

500
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:37,070
coming out of there your small quantity

501
00:20:34,789 --> 00:20:39,019
still test plots so I think the bulk of

502
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:43,549
this is still going to be from the

503
00:20:39,019 --> 00:20:45,558
traditional side again imports okay and

504
00:20:43,549 --> 00:20:47,058
when you see I haven't seen an

505
00:20:45,558 --> 00:20:49,069
industrial have field in person yet but

506
00:20:47,058 --> 00:20:50,569
what I'm picturing is something with a

507
00:20:49,069 --> 00:20:52,159
lot of genetic diversity and variety

508
00:20:50,569 --> 00:20:54,019
where you're gonna have plants of all

509
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:56,179
Heights and sizes

510
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:58,400
we haven't gotten breeding as I

511
00:20:56,179 --> 00:21:01,009
understand it to the point where like

512
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:03,920
another agricultural crop where you'll

513
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:06,109
see consistency across the field are we

514
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:09,320
headed that direction or are you already

515
00:21:06,109 --> 00:21:12,529
seeing some of that in the field well I

516
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:15,109
you know from what I'm I keep in mind

517
00:21:12,529 --> 00:21:16,549
that you know the vast majority of acres

518
00:21:15,109 --> 00:21:20,149
in the US haven't have been

519
00:21:16,549 --> 00:21:22,129
non-traditional but the in some fields

520
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:26,720
of the Canadian seed brought in that was

521
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:29,120
very uniform I have witnessed a field in

522
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,460
Colorado and and one in Kentucky that

523
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:36,379
was very erratic in its in its heights

524
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:40,009
so I and I don't know what seed was he'd

525
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:42,460
stock the the erratic Heights were but

526
00:21:40,009 --> 00:21:44,900
but from what I saw on the I'm the

527
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:47,000
import from from the Canadian side they

528
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:50,269
seem to be pretty uniform so I've got a

529
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:53,000
two parter Michael is there any way you

530
00:21:50,269 --> 00:21:55,490
can explain why the wording regarding

531
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:59,170
the FDA and the Food Drug and Cosmetic

532
00:21:55,490 --> 00:22:01,339
Act Authority was included in the bill

533
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:03,920
well keep in mind that you know this

534
00:22:01,339 --> 00:22:05,839
bill was was predominantly written in

535
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:08,450
Senator McConnell's office although it's

536
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:12,409
been the bulk of that language has been

537
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:14,410
a kind of a succession of language

538
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:16,460
from the 2000 I'm from that from the

539
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:20,060
industrial hemp farming act that started

540
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:24,259
in 2013 I can't say that I think that

541
00:22:20,059 --> 00:22:27,289
you know as word as word as we're ending

542
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:30,319
and an eighth decade old oversight of

543
00:22:27,289 --> 00:22:32,059
the federal government by this and the

544
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:35,119
concerns that have had their fingers on

545
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:40,250
this pie so that would that be FDA or

546
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:43,519
DEA you know these you know these these

547
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:46,190
old regulators die hard and I and I

548
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:48,170
think that I'm gonna I'm somewhat

549
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:49,789
speculative but you know the FDA has

550
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:53,210
always had authority over labeling and

551
00:22:49,789 --> 00:22:54,980
claims and I think they will continue to

552
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:57,170
to do that to the extent that we're

553
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:59,870
going to be in the supplement or food

554
00:22:57,170 --> 00:23:01,970
additive space even though we're deep

555
00:22:59,869 --> 00:23:04,369
even though that we are going to be d

556
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:06,259
scheduled on an agricultural crop you

557
00:23:04,369 --> 00:23:09,309
know I think they're the this is just a

558
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:13,039
matter of a time frame of how we kind of

559
00:23:09,309 --> 00:23:15,470
we lessen that oversight and and and and

560
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:17,450
get to a you know kind of you know a

561
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:18,740
less relaxed atmosphere and I don't

562
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:20,360
really relaxed in the sense that we want

563
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:24,440
to put anything out bad I just mean that

564
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:27,439
that the the a and I think and I think

565
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:29,840
we need to look at the the nuance and

566
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:32,840
the rhetoric that comes from their from

567
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:34,279
their statements their their their

568
00:23:32,839 --> 00:23:37,339
statement kept that which came out the

569
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:38,809
day after you know I think was you know

570
00:23:37,339 --> 00:23:40,339
when I look at it I think it's you know

571
00:23:38,809 --> 00:23:43,009
I think they had to do what they had to

572
00:23:40,339 --> 00:23:45,409
do they they still have their their

573
00:23:43,009 --> 00:23:48,049
framework and what they think they need

574
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:50,509
to do and and again this policy journey

575
00:23:48,049 --> 00:23:53,480
isn't done we're gonna have some we'll

576
00:23:50,509 --> 00:23:56,000
have some clean up language I think we

577
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:59,299
may you know over time see things like

578
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,849
increases in the THC we know that a year

579
00:23:59,299 --> 00:24:04,039
ago congressman Bob Goodlatte who was

580
00:24:01,849 --> 00:24:07,069
the chair of the House Judiciary was

581
00:24:04,039 --> 00:24:11,089
open to moving that up to a to a point

582
00:24:07,069 --> 00:24:14,649
six you know so I think III don't get

583
00:24:11,089 --> 00:24:17,149
too tangled up and in some of this I

584
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:19,280
watch a lot of social media feeds and I

585
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:21,290
generally don't engage because I think

586
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:22,700
there is a lot of you know Osteria

587
00:24:21,289 --> 00:24:25,430
there's a lot of it goes from hysteria

588
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:26,870
to concern to well this is you know for

589
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:29,000
n for my role which

590
00:24:26,869 --> 00:24:31,549
generally been policy you know I think

591
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,640
these these things are it's just not one

592
00:24:31,549 --> 00:24:37,549
giant step and you fix everything will

593
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:39,790
continue to tweak and and and make it

594
00:24:37,549 --> 00:24:43,669
better for the industry and I I'm not a

595
00:24:39,789 --> 00:24:46,759
I'm not really a conspiracy theory guy

596
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:49,190
on what's going on here but maybe they

597
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:51,109
exist I don't know I I don't you know

598
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:52,640
that's not my world and I don't and I

599
00:24:51,109 --> 00:24:55,699
don't really kind of fall into that camp

600
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,530
I think that we're demonstrating that

601
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:59,450
this is going to be a you know a serious

602
00:24:57,529 --> 00:25:01,789
robust industry with a lot of

603
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:03,410
opportunity and I and and the and if

604
00:25:01,789 --> 00:25:05,480
there's anything politicians understand

605
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:07,670
is you know the job creation and the

606
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:09,890
things that all the things that are good

607
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:12,769
about this industry and so it's our job

608
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:14,929
as advocates to continue to push for you

609
00:25:12,769 --> 00:25:17,000
know better and better language and

610
00:25:14,929 --> 00:25:18,950
environments and it's and it's a the

611
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,720
regulator's job to to take is that

612
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:23,058
generally take it as conservative

613
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,799
approach as they can what's a with with

614
00:25:23,058 --> 00:25:27,379
the with the regulations they've been

615
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:30,200
handed so in somewhere in the middle of

616
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:32,120
all that we we find a way to all coexist

617
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:35,330
and I think that's you know that's

618
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:37,489
that's my net native my opinion and and

619
00:25:35,329 --> 00:25:41,240
not shared by everyone but that's but

620
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:43,160
it's but it's mine so you're in Iowa

621
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:45,589
like you said which is a state that is

622
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:47,808
not legalized yet what are you seeing

623
00:25:45,589 --> 00:25:49,159
from farmers they're like you know crop

624
00:25:47,808 --> 00:25:51,139
farmers that have been growing other

625
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:56,050
vegetables and other crops is they're

626
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:59,030
becoming sort of this acceptance of of

627
00:25:56,049 --> 00:26:00,799
hemp as a possibility are people getting

628
00:25:59,029 --> 00:26:04,519
excited about it is there's still a lot

629
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:06,460
of negativity and and and things like

630
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:10,670
that around the crop what are you seeing

631
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:12,920
well I see oh and I see and hear a lot

632
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:17,110
of enthusiasm for that I think again at

633
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:19,970
just the this general disconnect between

634
00:26:17,109 --> 00:26:22,428
policymakers and you know farmers and

635
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:23,839
and rural advocates and those knows on

636
00:26:22,429 --> 00:26:25,940
the ground

637
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:29,359
mostly rooted in you know again

638
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:31,460
decades-old myths and lies and and

639
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:33,799
constructs that that made no sense at

640
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:37,309
all so I I think his general enthusiasm

641
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:39,319
and but but in and then I was case you

642
00:26:37,309 --> 00:26:40,819
know they're very corn centric there's a

643
00:26:39,319 --> 00:26:43,908
lot of genetics companies and

644
00:26:40,819 --> 00:26:45,950
chemical companies here most of this is

645
00:26:43,909 --> 00:26:48,590
all you know built upon that that house

646
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:51,710
of cards which we call the you know the

647
00:26:48,589 --> 00:26:53,418
farm bill the and and you know

648
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:56,389
everything that that props that system

649
00:26:53,419 --> 00:26:58,070
up so there's there's infrastructure and

650
00:26:56,388 --> 00:27:00,439
history here and the legacy to what

651
00:26:58,069 --> 00:27:02,569
Iowans many Iowans think they are and

652
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:05,990
then you have a very I think a strong

653
00:27:02,569 --> 00:27:07,759
and growing group out there that know

654
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:09,200
that we need you know we need a third

655
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:12,798
way we need up we need a third

656
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:14,750
illegitimate third crop to do a lot of

657
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:17,960
things whether it's clean up soil

658
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:20,359
cleaning up the environment and creating

659
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:23,179
new jobs for rural Iowa and rural

660
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:24,199
America ok that brought up an

661
00:27:23,179 --> 00:27:26,389
interesting question because you

662
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:31,129
mentioned remediation when we're talking

663
00:27:26,388 --> 00:27:34,099
about hemp right now how do you how are

664
00:27:31,128 --> 00:27:35,509
you defining that versus say a lot of

665
00:27:34,099 --> 00:27:38,449
what people are talking about around

666
00:27:35,509 --> 00:27:39,860
CBDs so I realized that it seems that a

667
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:41,480
lot of the cultivation that people are

668
00:27:39,859 --> 00:27:43,189
most excited about right now is not from

669
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:45,200
like a textile or a more traditional

670
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:47,990
industrial hemp perspective but really

671
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:50,659
for the the CBD possibilities what are

672
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:52,009
how are you defining these terms and how

673
00:27:50,659 --> 00:27:53,269
do you think they're relevant in terms

674
00:27:52,009 --> 00:27:56,360
of how people are looking to grow the

675
00:27:53,269 --> 00:27:58,159
plant well I'd say in the regenerative

676
00:27:56,359 --> 00:28:01,969
space that is that is that is most

677
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:04,309
definitely going to be in the

678
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:07,490
traditional growth not the not the CBD

679
00:28:04,308 --> 00:28:09,259
space so I think we have in one side we

680
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:11,808
have on the CB side you know health and

681
00:28:09,259 --> 00:28:14,569
wellness and and and and you know grow

682
00:28:11,808 --> 00:28:16,220
naturally and job creation doing what

683
00:28:14,569 --> 00:28:19,908
we're doing then then over on the other

684
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:23,110
side of the ledger with more traditional

685
00:28:19,909 --> 00:28:25,070
grows is where we're going to see the

686
00:28:23,109 --> 00:28:28,278
you know I think the practice of

687
00:28:25,069 --> 00:28:30,859
regenerative soil and and and so our

688
00:28:28,278 --> 00:28:33,099
remediation and and then the things that

689
00:28:30,859 --> 00:28:37,278
that plant does best when it's planted

690
00:28:33,099 --> 00:28:39,079
you in the more traditional terms sir

691
00:28:37,278 --> 00:28:42,440
you seeing is maybe becoming part of a

692
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:44,658
more conventional crop cycle for Iowans

693
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:47,179
is a way of remediating the soil then is

694
00:28:44,659 --> 00:28:48,860
that that's how we you know I think

695
00:28:47,179 --> 00:28:51,169
it'll be both because I think that the

696
00:28:48,859 --> 00:28:53,628
magic of this plant is that it it

697
00:28:51,169 --> 00:28:54,470
presides it you know it provides a space

698
00:28:53,628 --> 00:28:56,359
for

699
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:58,610
for everyone whether you're a small Iowa

700
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:59,898
farmer who wouldn't be surrounded by

701
00:28:58,609 --> 00:29:02,990
traditional crops of wanting to

702
00:28:59,898 --> 00:29:04,699
incorporate you know some a CBD Grove or

703
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:06,740
a young one of your children wanted to

704
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:07,788
return you're a young person coming back

705
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:10,159
wanting to come back to the rural

706
00:29:07,788 --> 00:29:11,179
landscape you're gonna have I think the

707
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:14,659
end and you're willing to put in that

708
00:29:11,179 --> 00:29:18,139
work in that time you know I the the CBD

709
00:29:14,659 --> 00:29:20,990
space you know allows that opportunity

710
00:29:18,138 --> 00:29:22,579
to come to fruition if you're a more

711
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:24,378
traditional AIA one if you're a corn and

712
00:29:22,579 --> 00:29:26,569
soybean farmer you're looking for a

713
00:29:24,378 --> 00:29:29,439
rotation maybe your your buffer areas

714
00:29:26,569 --> 00:29:31,970
would be better suited to a hemp crop

715
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,590
from from a water quality and soil

716
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:35,929
quality perspective you'll do that now

717
00:29:33,589 --> 00:29:37,730
again we're going to get back into you

718
00:29:35,929 --> 00:29:42,830
know that this these spacing issues and

719
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:46,339
and in the pollination challenges with

720
00:29:42,829 --> 00:29:47,808
that but but we're gonna have both so if

721
00:29:46,339 --> 00:29:50,269
you could wave a magic wand and create

722
00:29:47,808 --> 00:29:51,950
whatever policy you wanted around hemp

723
00:29:50,269 --> 00:29:54,128
and cannabis how would you set up a

724
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:57,558
state like Iowa

725
00:29:54,128 --> 00:30:00,319
well I think that we may see and it may

726
00:29:57,558 --> 00:30:02,509
be useful if we get it down to a more

727
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:05,269
local level or from a county perspective

728
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:06,829
you know now that we've we've ended the

729
00:30:05,269 --> 00:30:08,990
prohibition of the federal level we have

730
00:30:06,829 --> 00:30:10,369
statewide regulations but I think

731
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:12,859
ultimately this is going to have to come

732
00:30:10,369 --> 00:30:16,609
down to some some County involvement

733
00:30:12,859 --> 00:30:18,288
where we we're where we map our they

734
00:30:16,609 --> 00:30:19,398
there's going to have to be I think

735
00:30:18,288 --> 00:30:22,519
there's gonna have to be a lot of work

736
00:30:19,398 --> 00:30:24,128
on the county level on on how these

737
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:27,230
worlds are going to live together

738
00:30:24,128 --> 00:30:31,000
I don't see any way of getting around

739
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:33,528
that because in in as in my you know my

740
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,878
my earlier description of you know small

741
00:30:33,528 --> 00:30:36,619
farmers coming back there's a lot of

742
00:30:34,878 --> 00:30:39,048
small you know small farms here in Iowa

743
00:30:36,619 --> 00:30:42,918
are trying to hang on did it over

744
00:30:39,048 --> 00:30:44,569
Minnesota and Wisconsin they where I've

745
00:30:42,919 --> 00:30:46,309
spend a lot of time with the last couple

746
00:30:44,569 --> 00:30:48,798
of weeks there's small farmers wanted to

747
00:30:46,308 --> 00:30:50,378
get into this space and and and and

748
00:30:48,798 --> 00:30:53,329
maybe we're gonna have regions where

749
00:30:50,378 --> 00:30:55,009
where the counties will permit one but

750
00:30:53,329 --> 00:30:56,329
not the other or they give priority to

751
00:30:55,009 --> 00:30:58,490
one over the other so the permitting

752
00:30:56,329 --> 00:31:02,898
process has a you know it has a priority

753
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:03,919
chain though and but I just don't know

754
00:31:02,898 --> 00:31:06,979
how we're gonna get around not doing

755
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:08,270
that frankly so you think this crop

756
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:09,950
could be a savior for a

757
00:31:08,269 --> 00:31:12,889
of struggling farmers on the

758
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:15,410
agricultural side or at least it might

759
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:18,980
have that potential oh I absolutely do I

760
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:21,080
mean I I've seen it in Colorado you know

761
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:25,970
this is this is attracting young people

762
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:28,189
back to these small farms and towns that

763
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:31,160
I'd frankly you know these young people

764
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:32,480
and and are very excited and they're

765
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:34,308
excited about the scrub now they're not

766
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:37,429
going to come back to these small towns

767
00:31:34,308 --> 00:31:39,230
to grow corn or soybeans or you know

768
00:31:37,429 --> 00:31:43,070
those kind of things but there's this

769
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:46,279
plan just opens up a whole new range of

770
00:31:43,069 --> 00:31:47,869
opportunities for that to happen and I

771
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:49,670
can tell you I've spent a lot of again

772
00:31:47,869 --> 00:31:51,949
going back to Minnesota and Wisconsin

773
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:53,900
the last couple of weeks you know these

774
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:56,630
these small dairy farms that are just

775
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:58,450
you know just dying on the vine if

776
00:31:56,630 --> 00:32:00,980
they're not dead already as a dairy farm

777
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:04,009
you know they have land they have barns

778
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:05,539
they have ways to you know get back in

779
00:32:04,009 --> 00:32:07,150
the game and stay on the farm and that's

780
00:32:05,539 --> 00:32:10,399
you know that's really excited me my

781
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:12,800
maternal grandfather was a small dairy

782
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,910
farmer in Minnesota he lived in a county

783
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:16,369
that was one of the largest milk

784
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:19,250
producing counties in Minnesota you know

785
00:32:16,369 --> 00:32:21,619
40 years ago there's there's almost no

786
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:24,619
dairies left today but the whole you

787
00:32:21,619 --> 00:32:26,599
know the rich land the barns these it's

788
00:32:24,619 --> 00:32:28,459
the descendants who want to come back

789
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:31,519
that's the that's a real thing

790
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:33,769
and so I'm really I for me I'm really

791
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:35,329
excited about that you know that kind of

792
00:32:33,769 --> 00:32:36,710
opportunity I'm also excited about the

793
00:32:35,329 --> 00:32:38,779
regenerative nature and getting a

794
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:40,880
legitimate third crop in that in a real

795
00:32:38,779 --> 00:32:46,039
rotation for the corn and soybean

796
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:48,650
farmers but for me what hits home the

797
00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:50,750
closest is this opportunity for the

798
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:53,690
smaller farms to you have something

799
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:55,549
that's going to let them be viable well

800
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:57,620
this could be a big economic boon for

801
00:32:55,549 --> 00:32:59,359
the state as well I feel like especially

802
00:32:57,619 --> 00:33:02,000
those states that are more agrarian and

803
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:03,229
have struggled you know that sort of it

804
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,740
seems like you know the center of the

805
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:09,740
United States there you see sea hemp is

806
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:11,420
maybe being that possible crop

807
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:15,679
especially if we if we eventually move

808
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:17,180
to some intrastate eat you know commerce

809
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:19,130
on this

810
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:22,370
I do I do I'm more convinced than ever

811
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:25,580
now that that is that is that this

812
00:33:22,369 --> 00:33:30,019
that's this is the real deal for the for

813
00:33:25,579 --> 00:33:32,899
that for those communities Michael when

814
00:33:30,019 --> 00:33:35,029
we're looking at the the regulations

815
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:36,860
around the THC percentage do you think

816
00:33:35,029 --> 00:33:39,470
that will get to a point where they'll

817
00:33:36,859 --> 00:33:42,529
be some rounding on the THC percentage

818
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:47,960
or is 0.31 going to be counted the same

819
00:33:42,529 --> 00:33:50,109
as point or are you know 10 you know

820
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:52,789
like dude right there's very like the

821
00:33:50,109 --> 00:33:55,599
cultivars for CBD hemp and I did seven

822
00:33:52,789 --> 00:33:59,149
acres this last season but they're

823
00:33:55,599 --> 00:34:00,439
they're not super stable you can have

824
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:02,390
very you know a lot of them have best

825
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:05,269
back crossed and do cannabis strains to

826
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:08,898
get certain term profiles or structure

827
00:34:05,269 --> 00:34:09,980
and my question is how are they how

828
00:34:08,898 --> 00:34:12,339
we're going to be looking at this at the

829
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:14,840
future because then once you extract the

830
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:16,909
CBD you're going to be left with a

831
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:19,610
concentration that's above that limit of

832
00:34:16,909 --> 00:34:20,628
THC that's to be destroyed so how are

833
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:22,820
they looking at this and where do you

834
00:34:20,628 --> 00:34:25,059
think the future of how they're going to

835
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:30,110
treat the THC percentage in the plant

836
00:34:25,059 --> 00:34:32,719
well I we are going to have to have this

837
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:36,500
conversation both of the federal level

838
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:39,109
and we're and as we see how the the feds

839
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:41,599
put their standards in place maybe we'll

840
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:43,190
get a little flavor of where we're USDA

841
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:46,519
is going to come from I think it's a

842
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:48,470
state level for instance in Colorado you

843
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:50,119
know I do think we're going to we're

844
00:34:48,469 --> 00:34:52,908
gonna have it we have to and I think we

845
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:55,579
have the political will to set some kind

846
00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:58,070
of research you know research category

847
00:34:55,579 --> 00:34:59,630
in place it goes from let's say 0.32 one

848
00:34:58,070 --> 00:35:02,330
I'm just sorting out some maybe point

849
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:07,099
eight or it may be something other other

850
00:35:02,329 --> 00:35:08,809
than that but I think in our case I'm

851
00:35:07,099 --> 00:35:10,429
going to use in use Colorado's case we

852
00:35:08,809 --> 00:35:12,980
have a legislature and a governor and a

853
00:35:10,429 --> 00:35:16,279
university system who wants our farmers

854
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:18,230
to flourish and understand that we're

855
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:20,450
early on in this game you're you know

856
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:22,610
not everything stable and and there's

857
00:35:20,449 --> 00:35:25,159
there's no reason with the technology

858
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:27,620
and the science week we have and access

859
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:29,358
to that that's something that's point

860
00:35:27,619 --> 00:35:30,980
three one should be destroyed and

861
00:35:29,358 --> 00:35:33,679
considered you know marijuana

862
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:36,230
just a ludicrous so I think we're gonna

863
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:38,000
I'm gonna guess that in this next year I

864
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:39,559
think Colorado is going to be one of

865
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,108
them there may be others that they're

866
00:35:39,559 --> 00:35:44,358
gonna step out and say okay we're going

867
00:35:42,108 --> 00:35:47,420
to you know we're gonna we're gonna put

868
00:35:44,358 --> 00:35:49,460
a buffer here and demonstrate it and

869
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:50,869
again then then and then probably have

870
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:53,210
to go back from a policy perspective

871
00:35:50,869 --> 00:35:55,280
back to a federal level to the federal

872
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:56,630
level and and do some tweaking again

873
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:59,210
that's what I kind of refer to earlier

874
00:35:56,630 --> 00:36:00,710
these these policy changes or you know

875
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:01,820
they're just not a one and done we're

876
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:04,849
gonna you know this is going to be a

877
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:06,680
constant modification or at least it's

878
00:36:04,849 --> 00:36:09,049
gonna be a modification for for a period

879
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:10,730
of time as this industry grows because

880
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:12,440
as we know I'd you know what we want to

881
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:14,990
get back to science-based arguments I

882
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:18,170
have been in private meetings with DEA

883
00:36:14,989 --> 00:36:20,149
concerns who would say privately that

884
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:21,800
they think the standard ought to be 1%

885
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:23,570
now they're not going to say that

886
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:27,400
publicly that's against you know that

887
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:30,350
that's in the face of the scheduling

888
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:31,608
parameters and and and whatever but

889
00:36:30,349 --> 00:36:33,559
they're forced to regulate but they

890
00:36:31,608 --> 00:36:35,299
would tell you that you know that they

891
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:36,529
think just and we know that there's

892
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:38,480
nothing there's no science behind two

893
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:41,660
point three right so I think our next

894
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:44,240
battle is is going to be proving that

895
00:36:41,659 --> 00:36:45,889
you know proving that out and and in

896
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:50,839
putting something in place that's that

897
00:36:45,889 --> 00:36:55,118
can be from a scientific perspective

898
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:57,650
perspective would be be put in place and

899
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:59,990
with that also relate to other

900
00:36:57,650 --> 00:37:02,630
cannabinoids that are in the plants that

901
00:36:59,989 --> 00:37:04,459
are not considered Schedule one but may

902
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:09,769
have a medical value because there's a

903
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:12,349
lot in the hemp and cannabis emo bars

904
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:14,840
that have more value that we haven't

905
00:37:12,349 --> 00:37:16,279
even discovered yet and have there even

906
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:18,140
been a conversation on that or has it

907
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:20,450
just been a conversation around THC and

908
00:37:18,139 --> 00:37:24,679
CBD which in my opinion is kind of

909
00:37:20,449 --> 00:37:26,779
limited right well keep in mind you know

910
00:37:24,679 --> 00:37:29,809
Abe language does you say you know all

911
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:31,940
extracts you know from that plant so and

912
00:37:29,809 --> 00:37:34,579
into more to your point to your question

913
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:36,820
dad was know that the only conversations

914
00:37:34,579 --> 00:37:41,210
are really around you know THC and just

915
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:43,880
the general CBD discussion but nothing

916
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:44,539
you know we have not drilled down beyond

917
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:47,660
that

918
00:37:44,539 --> 00:37:49,820
you know in Washington well the other

919
00:37:47,659 --> 00:37:52,069
thing I heard I got to hear Ron Ronald

920
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:54,230
Turco from Purdue speak and I'm hoping

921
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:55,609
to get him on the show too and one of

922
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:58,608
the things he mentioned is a lot of it

923
00:37:55,608 --> 00:38:00,259
was around timing of harvest when when

924
00:37:58,608 --> 00:38:03,139
you harvest the plant really determines

925
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:06,170
that THC content and plants that you

926
00:38:03,139 --> 00:38:09,920
know may fail or may not fail was really

927
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:11,480
related just to timing agreed again

928
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,700
another one of those you know that

929
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:16,099
you're kind of that going back to you

930
00:38:13,699 --> 00:38:18,919
know making those you know those

931
00:38:16,099 --> 00:38:21,440
science-based arguments like he made you

932
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:23,269
know to regulators and and again you

933
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:26,539
know I think we're you know we're so

934
00:38:23,269 --> 00:38:30,170
early in this game I mean if you really

935
00:38:26,539 --> 00:38:34,519
think back we we took on you know eight

936
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:36,650
decades of lies and myths and and and

937
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:38,989
turned it on its head now how often do

938
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:41,150
we see that happen you know in our

939
00:38:38,989 --> 00:38:44,750
federal government from you know from

940
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:47,269
policy so you know again and again going

941
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:50,809
back to that exuberance or irrational

942
00:38:47,269 --> 00:38:52,820
exuberance I think what we what we where

943
00:38:50,809 --> 00:38:54,739
we've gotten to is monumental I think we

944
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:57,289
still have a lot of work to go you know

945
00:38:54,739 --> 00:39:02,329
a long way to go yet and getting this

946
00:38:57,289 --> 00:39:03,559
right and good and so we can't rest on

947
00:39:02,329 --> 00:39:05,389
our laurels we've got a you know

948
00:39:03,559 --> 00:39:06,679
bringing at ease these things out test

949
00:39:05,389 --> 00:39:09,139
some of the state levels we have an

950
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:12,829
argument in Congress for you know for

951
00:39:09,139 --> 00:39:14,059
making tweaks and changes and and we

952
00:39:12,829 --> 00:39:15,409
certainly have near the activists in

953
00:39:14,059 --> 00:39:18,409
this community or passionate and I think

954
00:39:15,409 --> 00:39:20,989
we if we can if we can not if we can

955
00:39:18,409 --> 00:39:24,049
even if we can not mire ourselves and

956
00:39:20,989 --> 00:39:26,799
infighting and and you know and focus on

957
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:30,019
kind of what's next

958
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:31,519
will will be a lot better off for and

959
00:39:30,019 --> 00:39:33,500
then there will be a lot of what's next

960
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:38,449
is we've got a lot of those we're going

961
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:41,059
to deal with so Michael when I talk to

962
00:39:38,449 --> 00:39:44,089
other individuals that are getting into

963
00:39:41,059 --> 00:39:48,349
the space or investors a lot of what I

964
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:51,769
hear is that they're looking at

965
00:39:48,349 --> 00:39:54,199
international supply of hemp biomass and

966
00:39:51,769 --> 00:39:56,389
derivatives of him and that that's going

967
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:57,869
to be where the market that the market

968
00:39:56,389 --> 00:39:59,099
isn't going to really land and I'm

969
00:39:57,869 --> 00:40:01,380
Erica and I don't really believe that

970
00:39:59,099 --> 00:40:03,539
personally I think that there's a unique

971
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:05,760
environment here that are going to be

972
00:40:03,539 --> 00:40:07,110
specialized but I'm hearing that you

973
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,510
know there's a bit it seems like the

974
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:12,780
International hemp market has a good

975
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:14,430
head start on American Progress and the

976
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:17,910
question of you how do we balance those

977
00:40:14,429 --> 00:40:20,909
imports with our our own growth and how

978
00:40:17,909 --> 00:40:23,969
do we help educate people on the value

979
00:40:20,909 --> 00:40:25,920
and the timeline essentially it's what

980
00:40:23,969 --> 00:40:31,099
it does there appears to be a timeline

981
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:34,769
on the market in a sense as you know I

982
00:40:31,099 --> 00:40:37,110
threw it through my glasses and and in

983
00:40:34,769 --> 00:40:39,239
my view if we are going to have some

984
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:40,620
imports we see a lot of that happening

985
00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:42,000
and whether it's important to biomass

986
00:40:40,619 --> 00:40:43,859
with those imports of Canadian money

987
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,780
coming into the country to you know to

988
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:47,579
build this industry what Americans are

989
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:49,380
really good at is when you put a good

990
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:50,909
policy in place and turn them loose and

991
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:53,579
the world knows this

992
00:40:50,909 --> 00:40:57,690
you know we innovate quickly we you know

993
00:40:53,579 --> 00:41:01,170
we do good big things fast and so you

994
00:40:57,690 --> 00:41:02,369
know I'm I think we'll have two phases

995
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:04,050
here we're going to see some of this

996
00:41:02,369 --> 00:41:05,639
international we're gonna see the

997
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:08,250
importing we're gonna so we're gonna see

998
00:41:05,639 --> 00:41:10,679
a lot of positioning by folks who want

999
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:12,360
to you know claim that X is going to

1000
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:14,759
happen I don't believe that I believe in

1001
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:16,289
kind of an American you know ingenuity

1002
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:19,590
and what we're gonna do what we could do

1003
00:41:16,289 --> 00:41:21,570
here and I think we are we are going to

1004
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:24,539
quickly catch up with the world and then

1005
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:28,289
and then then be a leader beyond that

1006
00:41:24,539 --> 00:41:31,110
point in time part of part of what I

1007
00:41:28,289 --> 00:41:33,029
think is going to help us become that is

1008
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:35,309
on the genetic development and

1009
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:37,260
innovation around the cannabis genome

1010
00:41:35,309 --> 00:41:38,969
and the research that that a lot of

1011
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:42,960
cannabis companies are beginning to do

1012
00:41:38,969 --> 00:41:45,209
and how that will carry into him so with

1013
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:48,179
all that in mind do you is there a clear

1014
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:50,659
path for hemp seed USDA certification at

1015
00:41:48,179 --> 00:41:55,460
the moment or is that still ambiguous

1016
00:41:50,659 --> 00:41:59,670
it's still ambiguous yeah it's ambiguous

1017
00:41:55,460 --> 00:42:01,559
okay so when I look at the some of the

1018
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:03,960
regulations in California because

1019
00:42:01,559 --> 00:42:05,610
California has not issued farm IDs yet

1020
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:08,119
but they're allowing it so it's this

1021
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:11,180
weird kind of Wild West cowboy gray area

1022
00:42:08,119 --> 00:42:15,380
but what they require is

1023
00:42:11,179 --> 00:42:17,569
a type of seed certification and they

1024
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:20,269
call it like foundational generational

1025
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:22,309
and there's another term that that's

1026
00:42:20,269 --> 00:42:24,469
escaping me right now so if you're a

1027
00:42:22,309 --> 00:42:26,389
hemp farmer in California and you're

1028
00:42:24,469 --> 00:42:29,149
required to start with some kind of

1029
00:42:26,389 --> 00:42:31,039
level of certified hemp seed would that

1030
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:33,860
mean that you would have to purchase the

1031
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:34,909
seed out of the country like for you

1032
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:36,980
know with some other international

1033
00:42:34,909 --> 00:42:38,599
certified seed stock or is that

1034
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:41,360
something that we can create under a

1035
00:42:38,599 --> 00:42:44,539
research program with the right research

1036
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:46,130
institution well I think that they're

1037
00:42:44,539 --> 00:42:47,900
gonna have to get the oscar sort of the

1038
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:49,220
international certifications probably

1039
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:53,420
enough to kind of like California is

1040
00:42:49,219 --> 00:42:56,119
just you know but when I talk to folks

1041
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:59,450
when you look at the mess in California

1042
00:42:56,119 --> 00:43:01,880
and them and the the Keystone Cops and

1043
00:42:59,449 --> 00:43:07,759
in Hawaii on this thing you just think

1044
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:11,780
really I we are in 2019 right yeah well

1045
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:14,240
some of us aren't yet but but so so I

1046
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:18,650
think that's yeah I I think California's

1047
00:43:14,239 --> 00:43:20,209
you know well I'm gonna welcome

1048
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:23,119
California to the family when they get

1049
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:24,079
their act together got here to your

1050
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:25,519
point I think they're gonna they're

1051
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:27,110
gonna have just some kind of

1052
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:31,579
international certification of course

1053
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:33,860
the I believe I haven't stayed you know

1054
00:43:31,579 --> 00:43:35,809
was like really close to the rollout of

1055
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:38,870
the of the you know they're down in the

1056
00:43:35,809 --> 00:43:40,940
weeds but I do believe that there's a a

1057
00:43:38,869 --> 00:43:43,389
pretty significant influence from the

1058
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:48,170
canadian seed market in that in that

1059
00:43:43,389 --> 00:43:51,289
california framework so guess we'll see

1060
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:52,010
how that plays so with that in mind what

1061
00:43:51,289 --> 00:43:54,079
i've seen

1062
00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:56,570
so the hemp the hemp cultivars that i

1063
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:59,559
was able to purchase you know i really

1064
00:43:56,570 --> 00:44:02,480
look at is a low THC cannabis cultivar

1065
00:43:59,559 --> 00:44:05,059
those were created under a research

1066
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:07,760
program and certified under the purchase

1067
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:10,509
of another industrial hemp seed and it's

1068
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:14,060
just been a little unclear on how

1069
00:44:10,510 --> 00:44:17,720
there's a highway or a path for these

1070
00:44:14,059 --> 00:44:20,239
new cultivars to emerge where they can

1071
00:44:17,719 --> 00:44:22,669
be considered hemp or is it just being

1072
00:44:20,239 --> 00:44:25,109
measured on THC or is there going to be

1073
00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:26,059
some is this is still muddy and i'm

1074
00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:28,680
and questions that can't be answered

1075
00:44:26,059 --> 00:44:30,360
yeah I think for me that you're probably

1076
00:44:28,679 --> 00:44:32,460
asking the question that I can't answer

1077
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:34,500
I think that you know is yet to be seen

1078
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:39,059
and yeah yet to be seen how that plays

1079
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:40,760
out so I I wish I could I wish I had a

1080
00:44:39,059 --> 00:44:44,639
good answer for that Ted but I don't

1081
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:46,440
okay so and then the final thing I just

1082
00:44:44,639 --> 00:44:49,109
wanted to say is I wanted to thank you

1083
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:50,730
personally for being a part of this

1084
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:53,610
movement and doing the work that you've

1085
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:55,469
done it's opened up a considerable

1086
00:44:53,610 --> 00:44:56,910
amount of doors for a lot of people you

1087
00:44:55,469 --> 00:44:59,339
probably don't know and a lot of people

1088
00:44:56,909 --> 00:45:01,649
you know and I see that this opportunity

1089
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:04,950
is saving a lot of struggling cannabis

1090
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:07,579
cannabis farmers as well and I'm seeing

1091
00:45:04,949 --> 00:45:09,989
a lot of pivots from cannabis into him

1092
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:12,630
because some of the understanding and

1093
00:45:09,989 --> 00:45:14,519
experience will apply especially when

1094
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:16,740
cultivating the higher CBD I just wanted

1095
00:45:14,519 --> 00:45:19,079
to thank you for all that work well I

1096
00:45:16,739 --> 00:45:20,750
thank you and I'd be remiss if I didn't

1097
00:45:19,079 --> 00:45:23,130
mention that you know I've had the

1098
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:25,019
govern the blessing I'm doing the Willie

1099
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:27,450
Nelson family for a little over 15 years

1100
00:45:25,019 --> 00:45:30,389
and one of my first conversations with

1101
00:45:27,449 --> 00:45:32,939
Willie back in the day when and early on

1102
00:45:30,389 --> 00:45:35,369
who this and he said that you know we

1103
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:36,720
will start saving the small American

1104
00:45:35,369 --> 00:45:39,000
farmer the day that they can start

1105
00:45:36,719 --> 00:45:41,369
growing cannabis on their farms and I

1106
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:44,699
got you know he was he was right it just

1107
00:45:41,369 --> 00:45:47,009
took us a long time to get here but at

1108
00:45:44,699 --> 00:45:49,949
least we're here we got a place to start

1109
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:53,880
from now I did have one last question

1110
00:45:49,949 --> 00:45:57,269
for you Michael I was wondering if so if

1111
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:59,849
I'm if I'm a person a grower or a farmer

1112
00:45:57,269 --> 00:46:02,219
that wants to get into hemp do you have

1113
00:45:59,849 --> 00:46:05,400
a sort of a pathway or any

1114
00:46:02,219 --> 00:46:06,869
recommendations for someone he wants to

1115
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:09,869
start exploring that as a potential

1116
00:46:06,869 --> 00:46:13,170
field well the best place to start you

1117
00:46:09,869 --> 00:46:15,210
know is at least I know in Colorado and

1118
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:17,519
many other states are putting together

1119
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:18,929
some really good information on their

1120
00:46:17,519 --> 00:46:22,530
son or State Department of Agriculture

1121
00:46:18,929 --> 00:46:24,029
websites so you know that's always a I'd

1122
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:25,680
say that's always a good place to start

1123
00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:27,540
there your regulators or you're gonna

1124
00:46:25,679 --> 00:46:30,629
have to you know go through them all

1125
00:46:27,539 --> 00:46:32,989
roads go through them and so I know

1126
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:35,579
Minnesota's you know putting together

1127
00:46:32,989 --> 00:46:37,289
you know has a nice place Colorado does

1128
00:46:35,579 --> 00:46:38,730
as well you some of the other national

1129
00:46:37,289 --> 00:46:42,029
organizations or soup

1130
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:45,780
great resources you know bode hemp and

1131
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:49,160
and the HIA I've got some great

1132
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:52,410
resources on on their web pages as well

1133
00:46:49,159 --> 00:46:53,730
so I think I you know kind of focus on

1134
00:46:52,409 --> 00:46:57,389
both and get to know your know your

1135
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:58,590
regulator and and then and then then

1136
00:46:57,389 --> 00:47:00,900
move into some of those those

1137
00:46:58,590 --> 00:47:02,550
organizations and and and join the

1138
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:04,230
organization and and you know help

1139
00:47:02,550 --> 00:47:08,490
