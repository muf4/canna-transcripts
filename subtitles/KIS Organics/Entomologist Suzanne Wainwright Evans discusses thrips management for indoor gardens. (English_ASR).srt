1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,600
for what you were dealing with I'm going

2
00:00:01,639 --> 00:00:06,599
to guess without seeing it was probably

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:09,320
onion thrips onion thrips biology is

4
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:12,039
very similar to Western flour the adult

5
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,759
flies in female she inserts her egg into

6
00:00:12,039 --> 00:00:16,160
the plant tissue it's in there a couple

7
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,118
days it hatches out starts cruising

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,118
around they have asymmetrical mouth

9
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:22,399
Parts they kind of more I didn't to use

10
00:00:20,118 --> 00:00:26,160
the word Rass but they kind of like

11
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:27,598
damage the cell surface there um and

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,278
that's why you get

13
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,480
that white silverish kind kind of color

14
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:34,359
to them because they're removing the

15
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:36,279
chlorophyll and if you look they're

16
00:00:34,359 --> 00:00:39,320
through when they're in their early in

17
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:41,840
Stars basically toddlers And even

18
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:43,600
teenagers they're they're kind of

19
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,480
yellowish clear but you can see the

20
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,760
green chlorophyll from the plant in

21
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:49,959
their in their gut and you know they

22
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:51,599
poop it out this kind of greenish color

23
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:54,039
from the chlorophyll but they're going

24
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,800
to cruise around and feed and this is

25
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:58,239
kind of and it it you know I always hate

26
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:00,558
to say things because people take it

27
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:03,439
like oh my God that's it's black and

28
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:05,158
white but no it's not but generally

29
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:07,879
onion thrips tend to feed more on

30
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:10,359
foliage Western flour thrips yes they

31
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:12,359
can feed on foliage but generally they

32
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:15,959
are more of a flower problem because

33
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:18,280
they really like pollen and so Western

34
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:22,719
Flower thrips are what we see a lot in

35
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:24,960
pansies and we see them in patunas and

36
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:27,319
we see them you know in lies because

37
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:30,959
they have a lot of pollen onion thrips

38
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:33,039
tend to be more Fage feeder and so when

39
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:37,519
you're growing cannabis guess what you

40
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:39,840
don't have present pollen so um and and

41
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:42,039
I think people because they they don't

42
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,200
do their due diligence and take the time

43
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,479
to ID which I don't expect Growers to be

44
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,320
able to tell species of thrips apart you

45
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:50,759
know that's my job that's extensions

46
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:53,879
jobs you know people that that can do

47
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:57,000
that stuff um but people guess and they

48
00:01:53,879 --> 00:02:00,078
do the matching photos online and you

49
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,519
cannot just match photos of what Western

50
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:03,199
Flower thrips and onion thrips

51
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:04,718
necessarily for ID from a distance you

52
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,359
have to look at the length of the hair

53
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:08,719
on the prot nooms you have to count in

54
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:12,919
tenel segments you really have to get in

55
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:15,159
there but but but but the good thing is

56
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:17,079
generally for onion thrips and Western

57
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:18,959
Flower thrips the management is

58
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:20,599
basically the same because the biology

59
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,560
is the same you know they're they're

60
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:25,518
young they're eating on the plants then

61
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,400
they drop to the soil to pupate and then

62
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:30,039
the adults emerge back up where it gets

63
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,200
sticky is when you're dealing things

64
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:34,120
with like Ayo thrips who do not drop to

65
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:36,560
the soil to pupate it's also a much

66
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:38,759
larger thrips the predatory mites can't

67
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,400
take out Ayo thrips so you generally

68
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:42,799
have to spray for oino thrips but when

69
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,879
it comes to onion and Western

70
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:48,080
flour the the BIOS work really well the

71
00:02:45,878 --> 00:02:50,399
predatory mites and all of that when it

72
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,560
gets into chemicals um Western Flower

73
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,120
thrips have more resistance issues than

74
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,598
onion thrips um but that's not something

75
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,280
canos people necessarily have to worry

76
00:02:56,598 --> 00:03:01,759
about because those kinds of pesticides

77
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,759
you're not going to be using anyhow

78
00:03:02,598 --> 00:03:09,518
so how do you feel about the SF nematode

79
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:14,080
sski approach following up you know a

80
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:16,120
couple days after a a couple suffoil

81
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:20,280
applications so you can spr would you

82
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:21,959
critique my yeah so um suff oil is fine

83
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,000
once suff oil is dry you can reuze your

84
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:24,878
predatory mites but if you're going to

85
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,560
do like you know two or three sprays of

86
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:28,079
suffoil x two to three days apart yes

87
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:32,080
that's smart to wait to release the

88
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,799
predatory M from an economic standpoint

89
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,400
I generally go with cucumeris more

90
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:40,200
because it's a lot less expensive and it

91
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:43,480
works just as well um in cannabis on the

92
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:47,839
thrips as sworski does sworski tends to

93
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:49,679
be you know a little more expensive um

94
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,560
so but no I think that's that's a

95
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,959
perfectly fine program and using you

96
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:57,280
know your sticky cards uh you know to

97
00:03:53,959 --> 00:04:00,079
monitor I think is a very you know good

98
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,598
good tool for that so yeah I'll give you

99
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:03,200
I'll give you a that so one thing you

100
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:06,719
mentioned was how they eat the

101
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:09,438
chlorophyll mhm so one of the ways I

102
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:11,239
just Scouting For thrips when you see

103
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:14,039
that like I always called it like the

104
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:15,878
shiny leaf surface yeah is how I see it

105
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:18,759
like it just has a different gloss to

106
00:04:15,878 --> 00:04:21,918
the leaf where the damage is is that

107
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:23,800
unique to thrips because I to me thrips

108
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:25,120
damage looks very specific compared the

109
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,960
other things and one of the things I

110
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,439
look for is that shininess along with

111
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:32,918
where damage is lace bugs can give you

112
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:34,639
that kind of look to um now lace bugs

113
00:04:32,918 --> 00:04:36,918
aren't a big problem in cannabis but it

114
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,600
has lace bugs have been reported in

115
00:04:36,918 --> 00:04:42,359
cannabis but it's not a huge economic

116
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:47,520
issue I mean it's hard to ever say

117
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:49,560
always but generally also um you know

118
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:52,839
spidermite damage sometimes can look a

119
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:55,879
little similar um but they don't have

120
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:58,879
that silverness but I don't always see

121
00:04:55,879 --> 00:05:03,000
that silverness with thrips damage but

122
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:03,000
you do see it that's good to know
