1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:05,758
you you only really need a couple of

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:08,919
nematodes to get in to overwhelm its

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:11,559
immune system um nematodes also carry a

4
00:00:08,919 --> 00:00:13,919
bacteria and uh in the case of Steiner

5
00:00:11,558 --> 00:00:15,439
nemma they regurgitate that bacteria and

6
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:18,920
it's actually the bacteria that does the

7
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:20,679
killing of the insect it it it it um

8
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:24,400
multiplies and then the nematodes are

9
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:24,399
actually eating the bacteria
