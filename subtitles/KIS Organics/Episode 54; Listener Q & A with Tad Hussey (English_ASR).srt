00:00:16,609 --> 00:00:20,279
welcome to the cannabis cultivation and

3
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,830
science podcast

4
00:00:20,278 --> 00:00:25,170
I'm your host tad hussy of KISS organics

5
00:00:22,829 --> 00:00:26,579
this is the podcast where we discussed

6
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,769
the cutting edge of growing from a

7
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:30,389
science-based perspective and drawn top

8
00:00:28,768 --> 00:00:31,799
experts from around the industry to

9
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,170
share their wisdom and knowledge

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,820
now before diving into the podcast I

11
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:37,890
wanted to fill you in on some changes

12
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,119
happening with our company earlier in

13
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,980
the year we received an anonymous

14
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:42,808
complaint regarding some structures on

15
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:44,699
the property after meeting with the

16
00:00:42,808 --> 00:00:46,320
county regarding these structures some

17
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,420
other zoning issues came to light that

18
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,100
require us to remove a large amount of

19
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,649
our storage and covered spaces on the

20
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,390
farm due to this change we are closing

21
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:57,299
down our seven acre farm as a retail

22
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:59,429
location the feed store edible nursery

23
00:00:57,299 --> 00:01:01,140
you pick and garden center are going

24
00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:03,869
away and we are rehoming all of our

25
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,489
animals we will continue to have the

26
00:01:03,869 --> 00:01:07,679
outdoor preschool on the property and

27
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:09,750
kiss' organics will carry on as an

28
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,479
online supplier of soil amendments soil

29
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:14,760
and supplies while it may seem like a

30
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:16,679
setback I'm excited for the opportunity

31
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,810
to refocus the business and have more

32
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,790
time to spend on the podcast soil

33
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:23,728
science and working with CAI Zen on the

34
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:25,170
consulting side maintaining seven acres

35
00:01:23,728 --> 00:01:27,269
and having so many branches to the

36
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:29,670
business is a lot of fun but it's also

37
00:01:27,269 --> 00:01:31,769
stressful and challenging with my first

38
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:34,769
child arriving in November I know I will

39
00:01:31,769 --> 00:01:37,649
have my hands full anyway anyway onto

40
00:01:34,769 --> 00:01:40,170
the podcast this week's podcast is a bit

41
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:42,780
different from my usual podcast i sat

42
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:44,159
down with Johnse a dedicated cannabis

43
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,989
grower and all around cannabis

44
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,060
enthusiasts who interviewed me on a

45
00:01:45,989 --> 00:01:51,478
variety of topics ranging from soil

46
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:53,460
compost tea microbes growing philosophy

47
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:55,379
and much more the goal of this podcast

48
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:56,908
was to answer some listener questions

49
00:01:55,379 --> 00:01:59,099
and just offer a different perspective

50
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:01,409
on some topics we've already covered in

51
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:03,179
past episodes I met Jon through our

52
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:04,320
patreon hangouts and it's been a lot of

53
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,149
fun hearing about his growing

54
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:08,198
experiences as well through the process

55
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:11,139
here's our interview together

56
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:13,219
[Music]

57
00:02:11,139 --> 00:02:16,129
hey John thanks for coming on the show

58
00:02:13,219 --> 00:02:19,069
today thanks for having me Jan yeah I

59
00:02:16,129 --> 00:02:20,329
know this was gonna be a question answer

60
00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:21,680
well you were gonna ask me some

61
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:23,690
questions but let's give lists there's a

62
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,950
little background about you before we

63
00:02:23,689 --> 00:02:29,300
get too far into it

64
00:02:24,949 --> 00:02:32,810
sure so I'm from Michigan um I grew my

65
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:35,510
first plants indoors in 1999 with very

66
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:38,439
little success but enjoyed the process

67
00:02:35,509 --> 00:02:41,659
enough to continue to learn about it and

68
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:44,780
from there I had done various gorilla

69
00:02:41,659 --> 00:02:49,219
grows outdoors on and off with also

70
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:52,640
varying success until 2008 when the

71
00:02:49,219 --> 00:02:55,340
Michigan voters passed the Michigan

72
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:57,109
Medical Marijuana Act that's what I

73
00:02:55,340 --> 00:03:01,280
became a caregiver and started growing

74
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:03,320
indoors again so I started using a peat

75
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:07,129
based medium who assaults fertilizers

76
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:08,299
and had pretty good success but you that

77
00:03:07,129 --> 00:03:11,210
I could probably do a little bit better

78
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:13,340
so continued my research and came across

79
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:16,010
a YouTube video of guy growing in deep

80
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:18,080
water culture and was very impressed

81
00:03:16,009 --> 00:03:21,919
with his results so I gave it a try

82
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:25,040
myself and after the first run I was

83
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:27,319
very happy the yields had improved the

84
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:29,689
appearance of the buds was nice the buds

85
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:33,349
got bigger quality seemed about the same

86
00:03:29,689 --> 00:03:35,840
as it was in the heat with salt so I

87
00:03:33,349 --> 00:03:38,989
stuck with it and had very good results

88
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:42,439
for many years until one ear like a

89
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:44,090
horrible case of root rot and tried

90
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:46,400
everything to stop there's different

91
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:49,069
products methods and nothing seemed to

92
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,990
work so I was in a panic

93
00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:53,359
but luckily right around that time a

94
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:55,909
friend had told me about your podcast

95
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:59,540
so after binging just about every

96
00:03:55,909 --> 00:04:02,680
episode I felt confident enough to start

97
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:06,699
my own organic living so grow so I

98
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:09,920
looked up a super soil recipe online and

99
00:04:06,699 --> 00:04:12,349
the first time I used it I was sold it

100
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:15,319
was awesome the quality of the product

101
00:04:12,349 --> 00:04:18,709
had gone way up the yields were just

102
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:22,730
about the same it was easy way easier to

103
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:24,439
do and it was cheaper so I

104
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:26,390
see a reason not to continue doing it

105
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:29,360
and I've been reusing my soil now for

106
00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:30,829
two years and have been great results

107
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,670
still tweaking a couple things here

108
00:04:30,829 --> 00:04:37,729
there but I am pretty happy with the

109
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:39,500
results so far and I'm not to say that

110
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:41,960
you can't grow great cannabis using

111
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:46,430
other methods but something that's this

112
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:48,939
easy to do affordable and natural is the

113
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:51,319
way for me and that's right Matt now

114
00:04:48,939 --> 00:04:53,149
very cool that's so good to hear I look

115
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:54,949
I actually I really like it because I

116
00:04:53,149 --> 00:04:56,329
beginning emails from people that said

117
00:04:54,949 --> 00:04:57,979
you know this is something I've been

118
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:59,810
wanting to try out and then the podcast

119
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:02,350
sort of just gave me that little boost

120
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:05,449
of confidence to really dive into it and

121
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:07,879
yeah that's that's awesome I love

122
00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:10,279
hearing that so thank you and for doing

123
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:12,769
what you do to encourage people to grow

124
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:14,119
this map it cuz it's great well cool I

125
00:05:12,769 --> 00:05:16,759
know you've and I know you've collected

126
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:19,550
a bunch of questions here from from

127
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:22,279
listeners on both the the patreon site

128
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:24,470
and then also through Instagram and I've

129
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:26,119
sent you and you've kind of compiled a

130
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:27,560
list I look forward to kind of answering

131
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,750
some of those and maybe filling in some

132
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,370
of the gaps that that were left with the

133
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:33,889
different interviews with with podcast

134
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:36,290
guess so I'll let you take it away from

135
00:05:33,889 --> 00:05:39,379
here absolutely okay we're going to

136
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:41,090
start with soils so question one what

137
00:05:39,379 --> 00:05:42,680
would be a good starting point for

138
00:05:41,089 --> 00:05:44,959
growers who want to start going fully

139
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,459
organic are there products methods or

140
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:48,169
Bruce that the average grower can

141
00:05:46,459 --> 00:05:49,699
purchase or make without an advanced

142
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:52,129
understanding of soil science or

143
00:05:49,699 --> 00:05:52,939
microbiology yeah this is a this is a

144
00:05:52,129 --> 00:05:56,540
great question

145
00:05:52,939 --> 00:05:57,949
and without getting too technical I want

146
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:01,010
to say first off you kind of have to

147
00:05:57,949 --> 00:06:02,689
identify how you how you define the word

148
00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:05,149
organic because there are certain

149
00:06:02,689 --> 00:06:08,089
products that are allowed in organic

150
00:06:05,149 --> 00:06:10,279
production that may or may not fit with

151
00:06:08,089 --> 00:06:12,439
your own moral code or ethics around

152
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:14,719
that word so certain things like fish

153
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:16,579
hydrolysate for example is stabilized

154
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:21,200
with phosphoric acid which is man-made

155
00:06:16,579 --> 00:06:23,959
or seaweed extract powder is stabilized

156
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:26,269
with potassium hydroxide and those are

157
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:28,699
allowed for use in organic production so

158
00:06:26,269 --> 00:06:32,629
like I was just visiting a facility who

159
00:06:28,699 --> 00:06:36,288
was using potassium hydroxide as a pH a

160
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:39,338
pH up or sorry pH pH up

161
00:06:36,288 --> 00:06:42,558
so I get those confused sometimes and

162
00:06:39,338 --> 00:06:46,430
they're like well so in theory we could

163
00:06:42,559 --> 00:06:48,020
use seaweed extract powder to raise the

164
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:49,009
pH because that's approved but I

165
00:06:48,019 --> 00:06:50,658
couldn't use put that potassium

166
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:53,598
hydroxide is so it's all a little bit

167
00:06:50,658 --> 00:06:55,579
silly what I would say though is kind of

168
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:57,800
do your research on products if you are

169
00:06:55,579 --> 00:06:59,508
going to use products but if you want to

170
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,460
be organic the best thing you can do is

171
00:06:59,509 --> 00:07:03,830
just get started and plant some plants

172
00:07:01,459 --> 00:07:06,378
in the ground don't overthink it

173
00:07:03,829 --> 00:07:10,188
don't overcomplicate it there's a

174
00:07:06,379 --> 00:07:12,860
million recipes out there just pick one

175
00:07:10,189 --> 00:07:14,718
and get started and the you know I've

176
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:17,059
I've killed so many plants over the

177
00:07:14,718 --> 00:07:19,158
years that's really how you learn don't

178
00:07:17,059 --> 00:07:22,520
don't be afraid to try new things and

179
00:07:19,158 --> 00:07:26,240
just just give it a shot I I would say

180
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:28,068
put plants in soil though don't don't

181
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,509
don't go with containers if you can help

182
00:07:28,069 --> 00:07:31,459
it if you're in a situation where you

183
00:07:29,509 --> 00:07:33,499
can plant a plant in the ground outside

184
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:36,949
that's where I would probably recommend

185
00:07:33,499 --> 00:07:40,219
people starting awesome cool actually um

186
00:07:36,949 --> 00:07:41,899
on that note is there a reason to use

187
00:07:40,218 --> 00:07:43,550
raised beds outdoors as opposed to

188
00:07:41,899 --> 00:07:45,468
digging a hole in the ground filling it

189
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:50,120
with organic living soil and planting

190
00:07:45,468 --> 00:07:51,588
straight yes so this is a question I've

191
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,240
heard quite a bit and I'm a big

192
00:07:51,588 --> 00:07:55,009
proponent of planting in the ground and

193
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,478
we're talking about outdoors and whether

194
00:07:55,009 --> 00:07:58,848
that's directly in the ground or in a

195
00:07:56,478 --> 00:08:02,478
raised bed just giving the plant as much

196
00:07:58,848 --> 00:08:04,069
root space as possible because the one

197
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:06,109
thing you want to consider with all

198
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:07,729
plants and in all growing situations is

199
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:10,098
you have to figure out what the limiting

200
00:08:07,728 --> 00:08:13,430
factor of growth is so is it is it

201
00:08:10,098 --> 00:08:16,308
nutrients is it sunlight is it you're

202
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:19,519
watering there's so many different

203
00:08:16,309 --> 00:08:21,559
things that can cause or stress a plant

204
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:22,939
out and so determining what that is and

205
00:08:21,559 --> 00:08:24,319
then fixing that and kind of working

206
00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:27,588
your way backwards sort of like a

207
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:29,269
priority list it is really important so

208
00:08:27,588 --> 00:08:31,459
when we talk about planting in ground

209
00:08:29,269 --> 00:08:34,759
versus in beds the things I look at

210
00:08:31,459 --> 00:08:37,549
there are what's your floodplain like

211
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:39,649
how where's your water table at if it's

212
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:40,728
very high then you may need to do raised

213
00:08:39,649 --> 00:08:43,038
beds

214
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:45,050
what sort of burrowing creatures are you

215
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:47,360
dealing with in your soil if you're

216
00:08:45,049 --> 00:08:49,259
gonna have Gophers or something moles

217
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,759
that's going to be digging up

218
00:08:49,259 --> 00:08:52,500
around those roots and causing

219
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:54,179
disturbance then you may want to put

220
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,909
something down underneath and then put

221
00:08:54,179 --> 00:08:59,549
in a raised bed what is the quality of

222
00:08:56,909 --> 00:09:01,469
your soil if your soil is it's just pure

223
00:08:59,549 --> 00:09:04,139
clay or pure sand it's gonna be really

224
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:07,019
tough to grow in it but again that

225
00:09:04,139 --> 00:09:09,000
there's no real reason not to go in soil

226
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:11,069
versus beds in the situation like that

227
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,590
really my big ones are water table

228
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:15,750
burrowing creatures and then the other

229
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:19,139
ones would be you know excessive heavy

230
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:22,379
metals or some sort of toxicity that may

231
00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:24,179
have been caused by by the previous

232
00:09:22,379 --> 00:09:26,490
owners of your land or some sort of land

233
00:09:24,179 --> 00:09:29,909
management issue where I don't know was

234
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:31,080
there a gasoline stored right above

235
00:09:29,909 --> 00:09:32,429
where you're trying to grow your plants

236
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,230
now well you're gonna want to get that

237
00:09:32,429 --> 00:09:37,859
tested and make sure that that land is

238
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:40,350
clean because cannabis especially is

239
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:42,300
very good at accumulating nutrients and

240
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:44,070
heavy metals into its leaf tissue

241
00:09:42,299 --> 00:09:46,319
there's plenty of research out there

242
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:48,390
that supports that so we want to be

243
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,280
really careful what were what we're

244
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:52,889
planting into but all that being said

245
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:55,230
nine times out of ten just put it in the

246
00:09:52,889 --> 00:09:58,889
ground awesome that makes a lot of sense

247
00:09:55,230 --> 00:10:00,420
cool so um when growing in containers is

248
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:02,129
there a way to recycle soil

249
00:10:00,419 --> 00:10:03,899
Andrea meant between cycles while

250
00:10:02,129 --> 00:10:06,450
keeping soil disturbance to a minimum

251
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:08,939
such as with no job yeah this gets a

252
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:11,190
little tricky so when we're talking

253
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:14,460
about living soils and reusing soils

254
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:16,680
there's a couple things to consider one

255
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:18,750
is the amount the volume of soil so how

256
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:20,429
much nutrients and how much biology can

257
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:23,879
really get going in a small container

258
00:10:20,429 --> 00:10:25,769
you know with our soils I recommend at

259
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:28,230
least a seven to ten gallon container

260
00:10:25,769 --> 00:10:30,329
for a full cycle plant now with all Auto

261
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:32,190
flowers that are you know smaller

262
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:34,440
genetics you could probably get away

263
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:37,260
with you know a five gallon possibly

264
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:38,880
even smaller I know Tim Wilson who I've

265
00:10:37,259 --> 00:10:42,120
had on the podcast he's one of my first

266
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:45,120
guests he was back in the 70s growing in

267
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:48,029
very very small containers of almost

268
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,320
pure earthworm castings in his setup and

269
00:10:48,029 --> 00:10:52,709
he claims to have had really good

270
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:53,820
success with that for me I like to have

271
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:55,080
a little bit larger container because

272
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,410
we're putting a lot of nutrients in

273
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:58,320
there

274
00:10:55,409 --> 00:11:00,269
and when we talk about reusing that now

275
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,550
let's say let's just use a seven gallon

276
00:11:00,269 --> 00:11:03,328
container as an example when we go to

277
00:11:02,549 --> 00:11:05,248
reuse that

278
00:11:03,328 --> 00:11:06,958
soyal the process is a bit more

279
00:11:05,249 --> 00:11:08,339
complicated because that there's not

280
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:11,099
going to be a lot of soil left by the

281
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:13,589
time we remove the plant and what soil

282
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:15,480
is left is gonna be much more depleted

283
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:18,179
to where you're gonna have to amend if

284
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,558
you want to go water only which is

285
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:20,548
really challenging to do with a small

286
00:11:19,558 --> 00:11:21,958
container you're not gonna be able to

287
00:11:20,548 --> 00:11:24,360
get all those nutrients back into the

288
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:26,698
pot if you do add that many nutrients

289
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,289
what's gonna happen is that soil is

290
00:11:26,698 --> 00:11:29,849
gonna thermally compost again you've

291
00:11:28,289 --> 00:11:31,860
essentially just added all this food

292
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:33,629
that's going to feed the biology that's

293
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:37,428
in the soil mostly the the bacteria in

294
00:11:33,629 --> 00:11:39,298
archaea and it's going to create this

295
00:11:37,428 --> 00:11:42,269
exothermic reaction where it's gonna

296
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:43,649
heat up the container itself and plant

297
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:44,789
roots aren't going to like that so you

298
00:11:43,649 --> 00:11:47,100
actually have to wait for that whole

299
00:11:44,789 --> 00:11:49,019
process to occur so what some people

300
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,159
have done is they'll run two soils so

301
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:51,839
they'll have one soil in their

302
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:53,458
containers the other soil will be

303
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,989
sitting and they'll reinvent and then

304
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:57,508
they'll flip it back in for the next

305
00:11:54,989 --> 00:11:59,970
cycle to me that's still a lot of labour

306
00:11:57,509 --> 00:12:02,188
which is why I really like beds so the

307
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:03,809
advantage of a bed over a container is

308
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:06,528
you can have multiple plants in a bed

309
00:12:03,808 --> 00:12:10,350
and if you go on our website you can see

310
00:12:06,528 --> 00:12:12,869
we just did a study with with gold leaf

311
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:14,220
guard ins Ben Higgins did this and you

312
00:12:12,869 --> 00:12:16,678
can hear about it in my interview with

313
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:19,110
him a couple podcasts ago and what he

314
00:12:16,678 --> 00:12:21,539
talks about is how planting where you

315
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:23,759
have communal communal beds so more than

316
00:12:21,539 --> 00:12:27,208
one plant per bed we actually get better

317
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:29,639
yield and better results than plants

318
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:32,729
that are you know isolated and planted

319
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:35,039
by themselves so you get that benefit

320
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:38,850
and then also each plant has access to

321
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:41,188
more soil per plant even though in

322
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:42,749
containers for example in this in this

323
00:12:41,188 --> 00:12:45,808
trial that we did each plant had more

324
00:12:42,749 --> 00:12:47,489
soil all to itself than in the total

325
00:12:45,808 --> 00:12:50,308
amount per bed but it actually worked

326
00:12:47,489 --> 00:12:51,959
out to where the plants able to push its

327
00:12:50,308 --> 00:12:54,600
roots out further because it's not

328
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:56,539
limited by a container so root space is

329
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,470
not a limiting factor of growth and

330
00:12:56,539 --> 00:13:00,808
these plants are able to communicate

331
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:03,798
there's a lot of really interesting

332
00:13:00,808 --> 00:13:06,838
research around around there on that and

333
00:13:03,798 --> 00:13:10,019
that soil in that bed is actually going

334
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:11,759
to be less depleted when you go after

335
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:14,399
harvest and so you can amend it at a

336
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:16,649
lighter rate and so what people like

337
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,039
gold leaf or doing and Justin who I had

338
00:13:16,649 --> 00:13:19,230
on the

339
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:21,539
cast with legit they're just reading

340
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:24,750
right back into the bed lightly telling

341
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:26,759
it in and then replanting you know 24 to

342
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:28,230
36 hours later because they just as a

343
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:30,899
commercial facility they can't afford to

344
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:32,610
have downtime what are you doing with

345
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:35,159
your beds John how are you reading them

346
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:38,449
well actually I'm growing in 50 bill in

347
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:41,969
fabric pots and when the cycle is done

348
00:13:38,448 --> 00:13:45,528
I'll just pull the the main stem out and

349
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:48,930
throw the soil ball back into a pile

350
00:13:45,528 --> 00:13:52,769
chop it up admire iam end mints water it

351
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:54,689
down and then let it sit for you know

352
00:13:52,769 --> 00:13:57,149
until I need to reuse it again and right

353
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:59,850
now I'm on a perpetual harvest so a once

354
00:13:57,149 --> 00:14:02,028
a week I'm doing this um but the soil

355
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:03,930
actually ends up sitting for two weeks

356
00:14:02,028 --> 00:14:05,730
is interesting you mentioned the

357
00:14:03,929 --> 00:14:08,458
thermophilic because I guess the other

358
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:09,810
day I was checking on the soil and it is

359
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:12,689
happened to touch some of it and I

360
00:14:09,809 --> 00:14:15,388
noticed it got hot so I sat there with

361
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:17,550
my iron thermometer and it was it was

362
00:14:15,389 --> 00:14:19,680
only 85 degrees but you know the ambient

363
00:14:17,549 --> 00:14:22,049
temperature was only 72 so it was

364
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:23,219
literally getting warmer than the air

365
00:14:22,049 --> 00:14:25,919
around it which I thought was

366
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:29,850
interesting which I had never really

367
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:32,309
noticed before so what I guess but that

368
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:34,230
being said I am I'm killing it up I'm

369
00:14:32,309 --> 00:14:36,328
I'm mixing it all up together really

370
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:38,360
good so all the amendments get in there

371
00:14:36,328 --> 00:14:40,789
is there a disadvantage to that

372
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:44,399
obviously you did this funny you just

373
00:14:40,789 --> 00:14:46,948
cited right there shows that ideally if

374
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:51,269
you can't have beds that's the way to go

375
00:14:46,948 --> 00:14:55,439
but for those that for whatever reason

376
00:14:51,269 --> 00:14:58,379
can't have a bed they'd have to use pots

377
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:01,319
is is a real disadvantage to breaking up

378
00:14:58,379 --> 00:15:02,879
the soil like that and remaining no I

379
00:15:01,318 --> 00:15:04,948
mean I've heard of people doing it so

380
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:07,528
many different ways there's people that

381
00:15:04,948 --> 00:15:09,120
are topdressing those nutrients and so

382
00:15:07,528 --> 00:15:10,379
rather than putting all the nutrients in

383
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,730
right at the beginning of the cycle you

384
00:15:10,379 --> 00:15:14,370
could talk dress with them which I

385
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:17,639
actually think based on what I'm seeing

386
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:19,110
it's probably better but it is more

387
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:21,990
labour and I think it's a little

388
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:23,278
trickier to it's a little trickier to do

389
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:25,528
but if we want to talk about like

390
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:28,259
optimal plant health I think regular

391
00:15:25,528 --> 00:15:30,789
feeding of nutrients whether we're

392
00:15:28,259 --> 00:15:33,610
talking synthetic or

393
00:15:30,789 --> 00:15:38,169
Organic I think is better for a plant

394
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:40,300
but it creates more work and also a lot

395
00:15:38,169 --> 00:15:41,709
more challenges I think a lot of people

396
00:15:40,299 --> 00:15:44,859
are still massively over applying

397
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:47,230
phosphorus we talked about that I'm

398
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:48,730
seeing it with nitrogen even that's

399
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:50,350
that's another one especially with

400
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:51,970
living soils you don't see so much or

401
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:53,590
hear about on the hydro side but you do

402
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:55,960
see it I think quite a bit with organics

403
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:57,940
but what I want to touch on is is this

404
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:59,530
idea that you talked about about the

405
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:01,540
soil getting hot so I think it's

406
00:15:59,529 --> 00:16:04,049
important people think about that

407
00:16:01,539 --> 00:16:07,240
because when we're talking nutrients

408
00:16:04,049 --> 00:16:10,359
organic nutrients or when we're

409
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:12,190
reinventing our soil what we're doing is

410
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,379
we're feeding all these all the

411
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:16,630
microorganisms you know primarily like I

412
00:16:14,379 --> 00:16:19,389
said that the bacteria and archaea and

413
00:16:16,629 --> 00:16:23,230
when we do that they're going to be more

414
00:16:19,389 --> 00:16:25,480
efficient at accessing that those

415
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:28,420
nutrients especially nitrogen then your

416
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:29,620
your plant is so we have to be careful

417
00:16:28,419 --> 00:16:33,610
with how we're doing that so if we were

418
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:35,740
to put too many nutrients in let's say

419
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:39,220
we have a pot with a plant in it and we

420
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:41,259
add a bunch of fish meal so that

421
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:43,570
bacteria is gonna be more efficient at

422
00:16:41,259 --> 00:16:45,789
accessing the nitrogen in the fish meal

423
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:47,560
then the plant is and so it's going to

424
00:16:45,789 --> 00:16:48,819
they're gonna start reproducing because

425
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:51,099
it has all this new food they're gonna

426
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:53,560
go crazy and it's going to not only just

427
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:56,440
heat up the soil potentially but it's

428
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:58,539
also going to be better at accessing the

429
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:00,390
available nutrients in that soil to

430
00:16:58,539 --> 00:17:02,679
where you may see a plant deficiency

431
00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:05,589
along with all the other stress that

432
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:10,419
you're causing from the the heat of the

433
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:13,149
bacteria reproducing so rapidly so it's

434
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:14,710
important to not when you're when you're

435
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:16,030
amending soils it's not important not to

436
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:17,680
add too much so that you have an issue

437
00:17:16,029 --> 00:17:19,509
like that and it's important to be aware

438
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:21,310
of when you are reinventing in that soil

439
00:17:19,509 --> 00:17:23,890
is sitting that you let it cool back

440
00:17:21,309 --> 00:17:25,659
down to ambient air temperature to know

441
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:27,790
that it's sort of stabilized and has

442
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:30,400
good nutrient cycling going on before

443
00:17:27,789 --> 00:17:33,339
you put a plant into it if you're in a

444
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,740
hurry you know getting the soil out of a

445
00:17:33,339 --> 00:17:37,629
big pile and into pots will slow this

446
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:40,000
process down dramatically so like for

447
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:41,950
example sometimes we've shipped soil and

448
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,710
even after letting it sit two to three

449
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:44,950
weeks just the process of begging it you

450
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:47,350
know

451
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:48,700
from a pile into the totes and then

452
00:17:47,349 --> 00:17:52,000
sending it you know across the country

453
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:53,680
or you know on a semi-truck all that

454
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,539
jostling and the reintroduction of

455
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:58,150
oxygen can cause that so they heat up

456
00:17:55,539 --> 00:17:59,859
again a little bit and when it does what

457
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:01,870
we want to do I tell people is you know

458
00:17:59,859 --> 00:18:04,089
let it let it cook a little bit longer

459
00:18:01,869 --> 00:18:07,689
is we like to say in the cabins industry

460
00:18:04,089 --> 00:18:10,329
or get it into those pots you know

461
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:12,549
maintain the moisture content and then

462
00:18:10,329 --> 00:18:13,629
let it sit and then give it a couple

463
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:15,250
days in and then they'll probably be

464
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:17,110
fine to plant into you but before you do

465
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:20,890
you got to reach down into there make

466
00:18:17,109 --> 00:18:22,629
sure it's cooled off and not gonna not

467
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:24,640
going to overheat so that's sort of some

468
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:26,740
some questions I get quite a bit that

469
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,500
it's kind of good to clarify so I

470
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:33,009
appreciate that so if you were to just

471
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:35,289
say water seaport some cool water sixty

472
00:18:33,009 --> 00:18:36,400
degree water in to that pot that had

473
00:18:35,289 --> 00:18:39,220
been filled with the soil that is

474
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:41,769
currently cooking and I says no lower

475
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:44,110
the temperature temporarily will just go

476
00:18:41,769 --> 00:18:46,539
back up as soon as the bacteria gets to

477
00:18:44,109 --> 00:18:49,779
work yeah yeah you're not really solving

478
00:18:46,539 --> 00:18:51,970
the problem with that yeah you are gonna

479
00:18:49,779 --> 00:18:53,559
lower the temperature temporarily but

480
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:56,230
really what has to happen is that

481
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:59,139
bacteria has to have the time to work

482
00:18:56,230 --> 00:19:03,099
through those nutrients and slow down

483
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:06,220
that biological process of consuming

484
00:19:03,099 --> 00:19:07,659
them in cycling them so really it's a

485
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:11,019
little bit more of a waiting game or

486
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:13,090
removing the thermal mass so from a

487
00:19:11,019 --> 00:19:15,190
composting perspective you kind of need

488
00:19:13,089 --> 00:19:19,230
like a through a three by three by three

489
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:21,250
foot pile to really allow it to heat up

490
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:22,569
you know it's not going to heat up if

491
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:25,990
it's you just have a small amount even

492
00:19:22,569 --> 00:19:29,259
if you add more nutrients to that just

493
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:31,779
in general as a composting rule so if we

494
00:19:29,259 --> 00:19:34,299
can get the soil out into pots typically

495
00:19:31,779 --> 00:19:36,609
that that introduction of oxygen the

496
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:38,799
movement of it slows that process down

497
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:42,609
and so it just it seems to work pretty

498
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:44,470
well but if you have a compost

499
00:19:42,609 --> 00:19:47,229
thermometer which is a great tool for I

500
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:48,730
think a lot of growers to have what you

501
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:50,620
can do with that is you can check the

502
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:52,240
the soil temperature and make sure it's

503
00:19:50,619 --> 00:19:55,449
not any warmer than your ambient air

504
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:57,819
temperature and then if you are cooking

505
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:59,170
soil you want to stay in that range of

506
00:19:57,819 --> 00:20:01,329
sort of a hundred and three

507
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:03,519
thirty-one degrees Fahrenheit Fahrenheit

508
00:20:01,329 --> 00:20:05,829
to 160 degrees that's where we thermally

509
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:07,569
compost material and if you can stay

510
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:09,189
within that range you're gonna kill off

511
00:20:07,569 --> 00:20:11,769
any pathogens in the soil

512
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:14,019
you're gonna kill off any you know

513
00:20:11,769 --> 00:20:17,230
insects weed seeds things like that but

514
00:20:14,019 --> 00:20:18,849
you will maintain your aerobic

515
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:20,620
microorganisms a lot of the good guys

516
00:20:18,849 --> 00:20:22,689
will still survive that process if you

517
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:25,869
stay under 160 which is interesting

518
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:28,269
because when I barbecuing or things like

519
00:20:25,869 --> 00:20:29,739
that you know they give you temperatures

520
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:31,839
that you need to hit it's the same thing

521
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:34,599
you know how hot do I have to heat up a

522
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:36,789
piece of meat in order to kill off any

523
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:39,099
bacteria in it that may be harmful to me

524
00:20:36,789 --> 00:20:40,720
without overcooking it you know so it's

525
00:20:39,099 --> 00:20:42,459
it's the exact same thing it's kind of

526
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,400
interesting oh that makes sense

527
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:48,220
cool I actually kind of kind of on that

528
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:50,470
note is it possible to add too much Rhea

529
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:51,850
meant when reusing soil is there any

530
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:54,730
particular ingredients that we should be

531
00:20:51,849 --> 00:20:57,159
using the caution like for the kids

532
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:59,769
nutrient experts yes that's a great

533
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:03,700
question so the things to be careful of

534
00:20:59,769 --> 00:21:09,960
are phosphorus so things like fish bone

535
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:12,370
meal guano's I I was just talking with a

536
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:14,500
manufacturer their day about bat guano's

537
00:21:12,369 --> 00:21:16,419
and he was saying about the process you

538
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:18,789
know that he's seen in the Philippines

539
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:20,470
where there you know how its harvested I

540
00:21:18,789 --> 00:21:22,450
think from a sustainability perspective

541
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:24,819
there's a lot of better sources than

542
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:28,269
fossil that for phosphorous than bat

543
00:21:24,819 --> 00:21:30,189
guano plus potential for contamination

544
00:21:28,269 --> 00:21:32,470
you know just with the way they're

545
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:35,500
sourcing it and the fact that it's a

546
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:36,850
manure based compost so I really I

547
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:39,220
really like to watch my phosphorus

548
00:21:36,849 --> 00:21:41,109
levels that's that's a big one the other

549
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:44,440
one I think that's really important to

550
00:21:41,109 --> 00:21:46,329
take a look at is what sorts of heavy

551
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,799
metals are we bringing into our soils

552
00:21:46,329 --> 00:21:50,919
this is one that I've been looking into

553
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:53,529
a lot more carefully lately and I've

554
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:55,570
really started to move away from soft

555
00:21:53,529 --> 00:21:58,299
rock phosphate or any rock phosphates

556
00:21:55,569 --> 00:22:00,519
for that reason especially because of

557
00:21:58,299 --> 00:22:04,029
the cadmium contacted content and rock

558
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:06,879
phosphate other things like manure

559
00:22:04,029 --> 00:22:08,769
sources you hear about supposedly

560
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,870
chicken manure is supposed to be a lot

561
00:22:08,769 --> 00:22:12,579
higher in arsenic I've seen some chicken

562
00:22:10,869 --> 00:22:15,398
manure compost and the arsenic

563
00:22:12,579 --> 00:22:17,408
levels were actually quite good but that

564
00:22:15,398 --> 00:22:19,028
is something I've heard traditionally so

565
00:22:17,409 --> 00:22:20,620
knowing your inputs I think is really

566
00:22:19,028 --> 00:22:24,308
important to eliminate things like

567
00:22:20,619 --> 00:22:25,629
sodium excessive amounts of phosphorus I

568
00:22:24,308 --> 00:22:27,579
mean yes your plant needs some of that

569
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:29,440
but not very much and then watching our

570
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:31,148
heavy metals so that's another thing

571
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,740
going too heavy with rock dust is going

572
00:22:31,148 --> 00:22:36,278
to increase our heavy metal load without

573
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:37,390
giving us a lot more trace minerals

574
00:22:36,278 --> 00:22:40,000
because you know your planet only needs

575
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:41,799
so much of those so those are the sort

576
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,440
of the starting points for me when I

577
00:22:41,798 --> 00:22:46,028
start looking at inputs is finding out

578
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:48,700
the source of them making sure they're

579
00:22:46,028 --> 00:22:50,319
as clean as possible and knowing yeah if

580
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,819
I had rock dust I'm in picking up these

581
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:53,168
trace minerals but I'm also gonna get a

582
00:22:51,819 --> 00:22:55,500
little bit of arsenic a little bit of

583
00:22:53,169 --> 00:22:57,970
cadmium a little bit of chromium

584
00:22:55,500 --> 00:23:00,970
potentially things that I want to keep

585
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:01,899
it very low levels because like I said

586
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:04,298
there's research that shows that

587
00:23:01,898 --> 00:23:06,398
cannabis will take those up do you

588
00:23:04,298 --> 00:23:08,138
happen to know it is helps not a bio

589
00:23:06,398 --> 00:23:09,689
accumulator of heavy metals is it

590
00:23:08,138 --> 00:23:12,250
because I know it's a very common

591
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:14,288
amendment to a soil bit because I use it

592
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:16,028
myself a lot and there's mostly a lot of

593
00:23:14,288 --> 00:23:17,619
stuff in the ocean that you might wanna

594
00:23:16,028 --> 00:23:20,619
keep an eye out is you know anything

595
00:23:17,619 --> 00:23:23,079
about that yeah I have a good spec sheet

596
00:23:20,619 --> 00:23:24,308
on kelp meal here let me see if I can

597
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:27,189
pull it up really quickly while I'm

598
00:23:24,308 --> 00:23:30,398
chatting with you but yes I there is

599
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:33,538
quite a bit in kelp let me look at the

600
00:23:30,398 --> 00:23:35,859
sheet real quick it's just loading but I

601
00:23:33,538 --> 00:23:37,000
would still be careful any time we're

602
00:23:35,859 --> 00:23:38,678
talking about these products that have a

603
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,740
lot of trace elements I think you have

604
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:43,269
the potential for four things so you

605
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:47,138
come in there that you may not want as

606
00:23:43,269 --> 00:23:49,690
high of levels of so I'm looking at this

607
00:23:47,138 --> 00:23:51,759
analysis here and it doesn't look like

608
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:53,230
they show it on this analysis but that

609
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:54,220
doesn't mean it's on there so that's the

610
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:56,679
other thing to think about when you're

611
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:58,450
looking at a label or a spec sheet if it

612
00:23:56,679 --> 00:24:00,038
doesn't have arsenic listed on there is

613
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:01,360
that because they didn't test for it or

614
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:04,148
because they didn't choose to list it

615
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:07,569
because it's not a necessary plant

616
00:24:04,148 --> 00:24:09,638
nutrient alright those are those are

617
00:24:07,569 --> 00:24:11,470
just things to be aware of so I I don't

618
00:24:09,638 --> 00:24:13,689
know off the top of my head the other

619
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:14,679
one I see a fair bit of is aluminum

620
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:16,210
that's the other one you want to watch

621
00:24:14,679 --> 00:24:19,419
that I forgot to mention before though

622
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:22,419
so what are some common sources of

623
00:24:19,419 --> 00:24:23,559
alumina I am it's in a is it azomite is

624
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:25,310
that the one that contains a lot of

625
00:24:23,558 --> 00:24:28,399
aluminum yes

626
00:24:25,309 --> 00:24:30,829
azomite is aluminosilicate i believe

627
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,750
though the last time i looked at it as

628
00:24:30,829 --> 00:24:34,250
in my test soap for years I was I was

629
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:36,200
always told that asthma was really high

630
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:37,880
in aluminum but then the last test I

631
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:41,150
looked at I don't remember seeing it

632
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:43,520
being excessively high relative to other

633
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:44,630
rock dusts but I need to go back and

634
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:46,609
take a look at that that's a great

635
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:48,650
question but anyone could go on there

636
00:24:46,609 --> 00:24:49,159
and look at an analysis of azomite on

637
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:51,650
line

638
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:53,090
I'm just can't pull it up really quickly

639
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:56,000
in the podcast but that would be a good

640
00:24:53,089 --> 00:24:57,139
way to check yourself and and you should

641
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,819
check that with all your amendments and

642
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:00,230
make sure you know I know what our

643
00:24:58,819 --> 00:25:03,379
levels are with the amendments that

644
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:05,089
we're using in our soils but if you're

645
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:08,690
mixing your own soil it's a really good

646
00:25:05,089 --> 00:25:10,069
idea to to track that down sure oh that

647
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:11,960
brings you to the next question

648
00:25:10,069 --> 00:25:13,849
are there any soil tested companies that

649
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:15,950
you would recommend anything nation or

650
00:25:13,849 --> 00:25:18,799
world wide as you trust or is that more

651
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:21,140
of a local thing great question so some

652
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:23,450
of it is it's better to work with a

653
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:26,150
local lab because they're able to give

654
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:28,279
you the data information pretty quickly

655
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:30,019
it's easier to work send in samples

656
00:25:28,279 --> 00:25:31,970
usually they'll have an agronomist there

657
00:25:30,019 --> 00:25:35,809
they can they can help you out the

658
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:37,900
problem I see with cannabis is one a lot

659
00:25:35,809 --> 00:25:40,190
of agronomists don't understand it

660
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:42,050
there's just not they're not making the

661
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:44,090
best crop recommendations from some of

662
00:25:42,049 --> 00:25:46,819
the recommendations that I've seen they

663
00:25:44,089 --> 00:25:49,579
just default to Tomatoes which isn't is

664
00:25:46,819 --> 00:25:51,700
is close but it's not the same the other

665
00:25:49,579 --> 00:25:53,750
challenge I see with it is that

666
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:55,670
sometimes the labs can be very

667
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:58,880
inconsistent like this facility that I

668
00:25:55,670 --> 00:26:02,779
visited earlier in the week the the lab

669
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:05,990
had sent them totally wrong numbers they

670
00:26:02,779 --> 00:26:08,599
day and they just said oh oops weed that

671
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:11,240
was a different customers test and you

672
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:13,009
know he's trying to do crop analysis off

673
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:15,019
of this and making changes on a on a

674
00:26:13,009 --> 00:26:17,990
harvest it's worth you know potentially

675
00:26:15,019 --> 00:26:19,730
millions of dollars I would have been so

676
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:22,099
pissed off like if you've got to have

677
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:24,890
consistent results and for me when I get

678
00:26:22,099 --> 00:26:26,629
sent lab tests from other labs that I

679
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:29,180
haven't worked with it gets challenging

680
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:30,770
for me because they all do so I have to

681
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:32,660
find out you know what sort of tests are

682
00:26:30,769 --> 00:26:35,650
they doing how are they performing the

683
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:38,180
tests what's the methodology look like

684
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:39,048
what do these tests look like relative

685
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:41,749
to the

686
00:26:39,048 --> 00:26:43,278
and I'm familiar with so if you take the

687
00:26:41,749 --> 00:26:44,569
same sample and send it to different

688
00:26:43,278 --> 00:26:45,829
labs you're gonna get two different

689
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:47,749
results there's going to be variability

690
00:26:45,829 --> 00:26:49,878
and sometimes it's quite high so you

691
00:26:47,749 --> 00:26:51,889
kind of have to get you kinda have to

692
00:26:49,878 --> 00:26:54,288
pick a lab stick with it feel good about

693
00:26:51,888 --> 00:26:56,418
it them in terms of the way that they're

694
00:26:54,288 --> 00:26:59,839
doing the process and then base your

695
00:26:56,419 --> 00:27:01,940
analysis on that otherwise it gets way

696
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:03,439
too confusing and then I would add to

697
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:07,249
that so the lab that we've been using is

698
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:09,080
Logan labs just because that's where I

699
00:27:07,249 --> 00:27:10,700
started when I first started with you

700
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:12,678
know Steve Solomon and the intelligent

701
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:13,999
gardener back in the day so that's

702
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:15,619
that's who I've been working with and

703
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:18,528
those tests I can look at really quickly

704
00:27:15,618 --> 00:27:21,168
and make really fast actionable

705
00:27:18,528 --> 00:27:23,778
decisions which I really like if you do

706
00:27:21,169 --> 00:27:25,788
do that in terms of the Logan test you

707
00:27:23,778 --> 00:27:28,220
want to get the standard plus the extras

708
00:27:25,788 --> 00:27:29,868
and then the saturated pace so the

709
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:31,909
standard test is a male like three test

710
00:27:29,868 --> 00:27:34,418
it tells you all of what's in the soil

711
00:27:31,909 --> 00:27:37,309
more or less it's an acid extraction

712
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:38,690
they're not perfect so that's one thing

713
00:27:37,308 --> 00:27:40,368
I want to emphasize I know I've said

714
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:42,859
another podcast like don't get hung up

715
00:27:40,368 --> 00:27:44,720
on a soil test you're not growing a soil

716
00:27:42,858 --> 00:27:46,819
test you're growing a plant and if that

717
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:49,308
plant looks great and everything is good

718
00:27:46,819 --> 00:27:50,808
don't freak out and if you ever get a

719
00:27:49,308 --> 00:27:52,819
test back that doesn't look right have

720
00:27:50,808 --> 00:27:54,470
them retested or send in another sample

721
00:27:52,819 --> 00:27:56,329
because you never know like you might

722
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:58,730
have just gotten a little too much fish

723
00:27:56,329 --> 00:28:00,378
bone meal in that particular sample that

724
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:03,440
you took in it threw off all your tests

725
00:28:00,378 --> 00:28:06,678
so keep in mind this it's just it's just

726
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,940
another tool the the may like three

727
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:10,369
tests the standard test will tell you

728
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:13,070
all of what's in the soil the other test

729
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:14,388
the saturate paste is designed and again

730
00:28:13,069 --> 00:28:15,648
they're not perfect but it's designed to

731
00:28:14,388 --> 00:28:18,048
tell you sort of like what's available

732
00:28:15,648 --> 00:28:19,819
to the plant right now so if I see just

733
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:21,499
a saturated paste test that doesn't

734
00:28:19,819 --> 00:28:22,960
really tell me what's coming down the

735
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:25,429
line in terms of nutrient availability

736
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,169
so if I'm adding nutrients I'm it's a

737
00:28:25,429 --> 00:28:29,389
little bit of a guessing game whereas

738
00:28:27,169 --> 00:28:31,009
the first test only tells me what's

739
00:28:29,388 --> 00:28:32,839
available to the plant right now or

740
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:33,858
what's of what's all is in the soil it

741
00:28:32,839 --> 00:28:35,628
doesn't tell me what's currently

742
00:28:33,858 --> 00:28:38,089
available so if I just put in a bunch of

743
00:28:35,628 --> 00:28:39,439
you know let's say rock dust that may

744
00:28:38,089 --> 00:28:43,788
not be available to the plant for a

745
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:45,649
while and so we may not see on the

746
00:28:43,788 --> 00:28:47,210
saturated paste test the same levels of

747
00:28:45,648 --> 00:28:48,918
nutrient availability that we would on

748
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:50,829
the mail like three tests that's why

749
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:53,650
people are using both those tests

750
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:55,809
I see but see you would rather stick

751
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:57,700
with one company and then get second

752
00:28:55,809 --> 00:28:58,690
opinion for example and go with because

753
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:01,269
he said they'd be different from

754
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:03,009
different labs would you why wouldn't

755
00:29:01,269 --> 00:29:04,629
you just send up to two different labs

756
00:29:03,009 --> 00:29:07,660
and then compare the results and then

757
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:09,730
kind of take it from there or does it

758
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:11,980
make sense yeah I get what you're saying

759
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:13,720
so you're asking why wouldn't we take

760
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:15,759
the same sample and send it to two labs

761
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:17,769
and then Jesse about what kind of the

762
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:18,940
differences in the results well the

763
00:29:17,769 --> 00:29:20,139
reason you wouldn't do that in my

764
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:23,200
opinion is just because it's expensive

765
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:25,480
because I've we've done that a different

766
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,769
facility that I visited last week did

767
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:28,420
that as well and they said the same

768
00:29:26,769 --> 00:29:30,910
thing like man these tests are so

769
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:33,039
different and so how do you know which

770
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:35,800
test is more accurate you don't really

771
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:39,940
you kind of got to just pick a lab you

772
00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:42,490
feel good about and then really just use

773
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:44,890
those results as guidelines so if I get

774
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:47,289
a test back and it says the pH is seven

775
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:49,450
point three the plants look great I'm

776
00:29:47,289 --> 00:29:51,519
not gonna freak out I'm gonna say okay

777
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:52,870
maybe the pH and the rhizosphere is a

778
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:55,389
little bit lower maybe it's closer to

779
00:29:52,869 --> 00:29:57,399
seven and so what I'm gonna do is try

780
00:29:55,390 --> 00:30:01,300
and mitigate things you know alkalinity

781
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:03,340
down the road but I'm not going to you

782
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:05,200
know make any drastic changes provided

783
00:30:03,339 --> 00:30:06,429
my plants look good so I use that soil

784
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,580
test to kind of point out anything that

785
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:11,350
just looks really wacky so if I start

786
00:30:09,579 --> 00:30:12,699
seeing that over time my calcium is

787
00:30:11,349 --> 00:30:14,619
getting too high and I'm starting to see

788
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:17,710
less availability of magnesium and

789
00:30:14,619 --> 00:30:19,779
potassium then I know ok no more calcium

790
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:21,519
inputs even if the plants look good

791
00:30:19,779 --> 00:30:24,730
let's start upping some of these other

792
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:26,410
cations as a way of improving the soil

793
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:29,950
over time without making any like

794
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:31,810
drastic changes ok it makes sense and

795
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:33,700
since you mention pH approach me to the

796
00:30:31,809 --> 00:30:35,649
next question do you have two pH your

797
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:39,220
water when growing in the water only

798
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:43,269
organic living soil good question I like

799
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:45,220
to still pH my water if the if the pH

800
00:30:43,269 --> 00:30:48,129
range is really far off you know if

801
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:50,799
you're already 65 does let's say 7/2

802
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:53,080
range I wouldn't worry about it I would

803
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:54,700
probably just use that water but I

804
00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:57,059
always like to get a water test and I

805
00:30:54,700 --> 00:31:00,730
like to know what's in my water so I can

806
00:30:57,059 --> 00:31:03,609
manage my soil fertility based around

807
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:04,360
what is coming in with my water source

808
00:31:03,609 --> 00:31:05,740
and I think that

809
00:31:04,359 --> 00:31:08,289
something a lot of people fail to do

810
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:09,548
that's important especially if you're a

811
00:31:08,289 --> 00:31:11,019
commercial facility like that's

812
00:31:09,548 --> 00:31:13,089
something you need to spend money on is

813
00:31:11,019 --> 00:31:14,769
is getting these sorts of tests down so

814
00:31:13,089 --> 00:31:17,199
you know all of your inputs into your

815
00:31:14,769 --> 00:31:20,109
soil and into your plant so that's where

816
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:23,798
I would start when we talk about pH -

817
00:31:20,109 --> 00:31:25,629
like every time I bring it up you'll see

818
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:28,298
arguments online and people are like I

819
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:29,980
never pH I don't worry about pH you know

820
00:31:28,298 --> 00:31:31,599
I threw away my pH pen you don't have to

821
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:34,360
deal with pH when you're talking about

822
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:36,159
living soils and frankly it's just not

823
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:38,139
true if we want to talk about optimal

824
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:41,169
plant health and optimal plant growth pH

825
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:44,350
plays a huge role in fact my interview

826
00:31:41,169 --> 00:31:46,960
with Colin Bell who is the founder of

827
00:31:44,349 --> 00:31:48,730
mammoth microbes and mammoth pee I'm not

828
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,350
sure which podcast is gonna air first I

829
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:53,110
have a feeling hisses so this is gonna

830
00:31:50,349 --> 00:31:55,509
be a little bit outdated but one thing

831
00:31:53,109 --> 00:32:00,759
he talks about was the research that he

832
00:31:55,509 --> 00:32:03,429
did relating to pH and microbial

833
00:32:00,759 --> 00:32:04,869
concentration in microbial growth so

834
00:32:03,429 --> 00:32:07,660
when we talk about functional groups of

835
00:32:04,869 --> 00:32:09,099
microbes pH plays a huge role in terms

836
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:13,570
of determining what microbes are gonna

837
00:32:09,099 --> 00:32:17,289
be most active and and and thrive as

838
00:32:13,569 --> 00:32:19,029
much so if we can create pH ranges that

839
00:32:17,289 --> 00:32:21,668
are optimal for the functional groups of

840
00:32:19,029 --> 00:32:24,190
microbes that help plant growth it's

841
00:32:21,669 --> 00:32:26,950
it's only going to help our plants so it

842
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:29,110
does it definitely does play a role all

843
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:31,390
that being said the reason I think

844
00:32:29,109 --> 00:32:33,250
people are successful with throwing away

845
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:36,299
their pH meter and honestly I don't have

846
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:39,669
one or use one I'll just get a soil test

847
00:32:36,298 --> 00:32:43,150
what I find with that is just soil in

848
00:32:39,669 --> 00:32:45,220
general especially microbially active

849
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:48,580
soils like these living soils they're

850
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:50,558
better at buffering pH than a hydro

851
00:32:48,579 --> 00:32:52,449
system so you know a hydro system if

852
00:32:50,558 --> 00:32:54,250
your pH goes off you're you're screwed

853
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:56,048
your plants you're gonna see it right

854
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:58,000
away whereas with these living soil

855
00:32:56,048 --> 00:33:01,660
systems the plants able to control that

856
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,429
that area much better based on the

857
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:04,890
microbes that selects for with the X

858
00:33:03,429 --> 00:33:07,450
States it's putting out into the soil

859
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:09,309
okay cool man I love that you brought up

860
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:10,660
mammoths because that translates

861
00:33:09,308 --> 00:33:13,359
perfectly to the next question that I

862
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:15,279
had for you so um it's better come very

863
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:16,899
popular lately that is mammoths teen I

864
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:17,298
actually started using myself and had

865
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:19,278
great

866
00:33:17,298 --> 00:33:21,829
results in the first ride but after I

867
00:33:19,278 --> 00:33:24,679
remembered as usual using the regular

868
00:33:21,829 --> 00:33:27,048
RIA Mendez I started noticing what I

869
00:33:24,679 --> 00:33:28,999
thought was a phosphorus deficiency so I

870
00:33:27,048 --> 00:33:30,288
was guessing that the phosphorus fixing

871
00:33:28,999 --> 00:33:32,360
microbes are using up the available

872
00:33:30,288 --> 00:33:34,460
phosphorus from the re amendment faster

873
00:33:32,359 --> 00:33:36,378
than before I started using my in the

874
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:37,548
right path here is it okay to just add

875
00:33:36,378 --> 00:33:40,189
more of phosphorous containing

876
00:33:37,548 --> 00:33:41,898
amendments every run possibly what I

877
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:44,989
would probably recommend is is get that

878
00:33:41,898 --> 00:33:46,488
$30.00 soil test from Logan labs that's

879
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:48,619
going to be way cheaper than buying more

880
00:33:46,489 --> 00:33:50,028
mammoth pee just to start out and also

881
00:33:48,618 --> 00:33:51,858
it's going to give you a good idea of

882
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:54,230
what your phosphorus levels are now

883
00:33:51,858 --> 00:33:56,118
ideally you'd get that complete test and

884
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:57,950
get the the may like three the standard

885
00:33:56,118 --> 00:34:01,579
test and the saturated pay so you can

886
00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:03,319
see not only what phosphorus you have in

887
00:34:01,579 --> 00:34:04,878
the soil but also what it's saying is

888
00:34:03,319 --> 00:34:06,378
available to the plant and keep in mind

889
00:34:04,878 --> 00:34:08,210
that that test doesn't take into account

890
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:12,289
these microbial interactions that you're

891
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:14,059
getting from mammoth pee so okay if you

892
00:34:12,289 --> 00:34:15,858
have low phosphorus then yes that's

893
00:34:14,059 --> 00:34:17,869
what's going on is definitely what your

894
00:34:15,858 --> 00:34:19,969
what you think the other thing that I

895
00:34:17,869 --> 00:34:21,470
talked to Colin about that we don't

896
00:34:19,969 --> 00:34:23,689
really know is what sort of microbial

897
00:34:21,469 --> 00:34:25,878
persistence are we getting how well are

898
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:28,730
these microbes surviving you know in

899
00:34:25,878 --> 00:34:31,519
between cycles are they thriving or you

900
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:32,898
know as as we re amend that soil or are

901
00:34:31,519 --> 00:34:36,710
we killing a lot of them off to where we

902
00:34:32,898 --> 00:34:38,239
need to reapply microbial products you

903
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:41,269
know more consistently like every two

904
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:43,729
weeks every month something like that so

905
00:34:41,269 --> 00:34:46,668
it could be a variety of things but I

906
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:48,530
will say you know I was I was skeptical

907
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:50,868
of mammoth pee there's so many microbial

908
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:53,480
products on the market and frankly I

909
00:34:50,869 --> 00:34:56,480
come in was sort of a skeptic sceptical

910
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:58,219
I like why would I why would I want to

911
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,719
buy these products because one of the

912
00:34:58,219 --> 00:35:02,419
things that Colin talks about to that I

913
00:34:59,719 --> 00:35:06,139
think is really important is it's not

914
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:08,838
about any single microbe or any you know

915
00:35:06,139 --> 00:35:11,719
particular species of or strain of

916
00:35:08,838 --> 00:35:13,548
bacteria that you're using if we're

917
00:35:11,719 --> 00:35:14,689
talking about pest control that's a

918
00:35:13,548 --> 00:35:16,429
different subject but if we're talking

919
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:18,740
about fertility and nutrient cycling

920
00:35:16,429 --> 00:35:20,598
it's really this idea of a consortium

921
00:35:18,739 --> 00:35:21,979
all these microbes work together in

922
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:25,760
fascinating ways that we don't even

923
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:28,369
begin to comprehend and so we can't just

924
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:30,690
take out and say okay this particular

925
00:35:28,369 --> 00:35:33,990
strain of Trichoderma has the

926
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:37,579
you know has this effect but it you know

927
00:35:33,989 --> 00:35:40,379
by itself in situ and that it will

928
00:35:37,579 --> 00:35:42,869
translate when we talk about you know a

929
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:45,088
complex a complex rhizosphere

930
00:35:42,869 --> 00:35:46,730
into plant growth so one of the things I

931
00:35:45,088 --> 00:35:50,400
like about mammoth P is they found that

932
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:53,730
when they took the five I think there's

933
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:56,400
five strains of bacteria in their in

934
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:59,789
their mix when they took one of them out

935
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:01,260
and tried it they got some plant growth

936
00:35:59,789 --> 00:36:03,539
but not a lot and then when they added

937
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:05,160
another one the same sort of thing but

938
00:36:03,539 --> 00:36:07,139
when they got all five together the sum

939
00:36:05,159 --> 00:36:09,420
was greater than the parts so it is this

940
00:36:07,139 --> 00:36:13,409
idea that they work together to create

941
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:14,880
sort of this this synergy and that's

942
00:36:13,409 --> 00:36:16,440
sort of what's going on in our soils too

943
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:19,260
so I think that's an important factor to

944
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:21,329
consider I don't know what was going on

945
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:22,980
with your mammoth P I will say like I

946
00:36:21,329 --> 00:36:25,560
said I was highly skeptical of mammoth B

947
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:27,630
but more and more facilities that I've

948
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:29,489
been working with it are using it even

949
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:32,608
with living healthy living soils are

950
00:36:29,489 --> 00:36:35,189
seeing really good results so I can't

951
00:36:32,608 --> 00:36:38,009
you know I I can't argue with the

952
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:40,588
science of it if I'm seeing you know

953
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:43,680
what weights going up 19 percent at gold

954
00:36:40,588 --> 00:36:45,960
leaf and you know they're doing very

955
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:47,299
good job of keeping controls to make

956
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:50,220
sure that there's not some other

957
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:51,359
confounding factor in there I think I

958
00:36:50,219 --> 00:36:54,480
really do think there's something to it

959
00:36:51,358 --> 00:36:56,460
I was very impressed with my first run

960
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,559
obviously you know keeping the controls

961
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:00,809
is a little bit more challenging for me

962
00:36:58,559 --> 00:37:02,969
but it was one of the only things I

963
00:37:00,809 --> 00:37:05,219
changed and my goodness it was it was

964
00:37:02,969 --> 00:37:08,159
impressive it's the real deal but uh

965
00:37:05,219 --> 00:37:09,959
that's interesting though so cool cool

966
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:13,078
alright so I have another question

967
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:15,210
related to microbes so what are your

968
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:18,180
compost tea recipes and what stages are

969
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:20,220
growth you use that so first off I'd

970
00:37:18,179 --> 00:37:22,108
refer people to our blog page on kiss

971
00:37:20,219 --> 00:37:25,828
organics com I've put together a

972
00:37:22,108 --> 00:37:28,318
document called compost tea guide it's

973
00:37:25,829 --> 00:37:30,359
free to download it's like 18 pages and

974
00:37:28,318 --> 00:37:31,829
I tried to fit as much information as I

975
00:37:30,358 --> 00:37:33,659
could in there and there's also some

976
00:37:31,829 --> 00:37:34,700
great recipes in there so people can go

977
00:37:33,659 --> 00:37:36,649
on there

978
00:37:34,699 --> 00:37:39,139
and download that for free and see some

979
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:42,950
recipes and and really dive into compost

980
00:37:39,139 --> 00:37:45,769
tea so in terms of recipes though I like

981
00:37:42,949 --> 00:37:48,049
to keep them simple so high quality

982
00:37:45,769 --> 00:37:50,000
compost source is really important you

983
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:51,170
you really have just a few things you

984
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,820
have to focus on we're talking about

985
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:55,130
aerated compost tea you have to have a

986
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:57,019
brewer that provides good levels of

987
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:58,940
oxygen doesn't have any dead zones and

988
00:37:57,019 --> 00:38:03,108
can maintain your dissolved oxygen

989
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:04,820
levels above 6 ppm for the entire brew

990
00:38:03,108 --> 00:38:07,219
that's that's the goal of your brewer

991
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:09,820
and then you have to have good inputs so

992
00:38:07,219 --> 00:38:12,379
we have to make sure that we're adding

993
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:14,420
we're adding a good source of microbes

994
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:16,760
that's your compost source that's clean

995
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:18,500
so we're not adding in you know things

996
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:20,930
that could potentially grow pathogens

997
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:22,940
and disease causing organisms someone

998
00:38:20,929 --> 00:38:24,649
asked me the other day about you know

999
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:26,300
the risks associated with compost tea

1000
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:27,470
and and we're talking about that I'm

1001
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:29,810
like well if you're grabbing a handful

1002
00:38:27,469 --> 00:38:31,159
of soil outside and it may have you know

1003
00:38:29,809 --> 00:38:33,078
potentially you're in an area that could

1004
00:38:31,159 --> 00:38:34,519
have root-knot nematodes yes you could

1005
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:37,369
be introducing something to your soil

1006
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:39,380
that could be really really bad if

1007
00:38:37,369 --> 00:38:40,970
you're using a something that's gone

1008
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:43,460
through the thermal composting process

1009
00:38:40,969 --> 00:38:46,848
then that's much less likely to be a

1010
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:48,289
less likely to be a concern so that's

1011
00:38:46,849 --> 00:38:50,450
your biology side and then you're just

1012
00:38:48,289 --> 00:38:53,150
adding a food source for that biology so

1013
00:38:50,449 --> 00:38:55,009
how do we feed those microbes and the

1014
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:57,588
easiest way on sulfur blackstrap

1015
00:38:55,010 --> 00:39:00,230
molasses a little bit of organic alfalfa

1016
00:38:57,588 --> 00:39:03,349
meal from my microscope work that's what

1017
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:05,838
I find works really really well we have

1018
00:39:03,349 --> 00:39:07,579
a product called microbe catalyst

1019
00:39:05,838 --> 00:39:09,559
because one of the things that Colin and

1020
00:39:07,579 --> 00:39:12,380
I talked about in the mammoth pee

1021
00:39:09,559 --> 00:39:13,909
podcast is how different functional

1022
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:15,710
groups of microorganisms respond

1023
00:39:13,909 --> 00:39:17,838
differently to different food sources so

1024
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:20,000
the the microbe catalyst that we carry

1025
00:39:17,838 --> 00:39:22,369
it's just a dry granule and dissolves in

1026
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,900
water it's a little more diversified in

1027
00:39:22,369 --> 00:39:26,050
terms of the amount of ingredients in it

1028
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:30,349
so we're hopeful that we'll get more

1029
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:32,030
diversified compost tea okay you can't

1030
00:39:30,349 --> 00:39:33,619
tell that qualitatively looking under

1031
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:34,910
the microscope and frankly I need to do

1032
00:39:33,619 --> 00:39:38,000
more trials but there's a lot of

1033
00:39:34,909 --> 00:39:39,949
challenges around trying and testing

1034
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,568
compost tea because every batch you make

1035
00:39:39,949 --> 00:39:43,699
is going to be different no matter what

1036
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:46,369
you try there's just too much going on

1037
00:39:43,699 --> 00:39:48,439
there and too much variability sure okay

1038
00:39:46,369 --> 00:39:51,050
makes it so you talk a little bit

1039
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:52,789
about fungal dominant teas yeah this is

1040
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:54,530
a question I get a lot or I see a lot

1041
00:39:52,789 --> 00:39:56,960
online too like how do I make a

1042
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:58,940
bacterial dominant T or a fungal

1043
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:01,670
dominant T and people feel like they

1044
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:04,970
want bacteria for veg or fungal e

1045
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:07,940
dominant these different things and and

1046
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:09,828
frankly I think to me I think that's the

1047
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:12,108
wrong approach so when we're making

1048
00:40:09,829 --> 00:40:16,039
compost tea the whole reason we're

1049
00:40:12,108 --> 00:40:18,828
making it is to add increase our

1050
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:21,920
nutrient cycling so what we want is a

1051
00:40:18,829 --> 00:40:24,410
bunch of microbes that are cycling

1052
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:26,690
nutrients with good diversity in biomass

1053
00:40:24,409 --> 00:40:27,828
in our tea brew and then really we're

1054
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:29,568
gonna let we're gonna let the

1055
00:40:27,829 --> 00:40:32,269
environment and the plant sort it out

1056
00:40:29,568 --> 00:40:34,009
from there so I look at it a shotgun

1057
00:40:32,269 --> 00:40:36,190
approach if I can make a balanced tea

1058
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:38,960
that has good levels of micro of

1059
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:41,240
microorganisms and good diversity then

1060
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:42,588
and we put that out onto the soil then

1061
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:44,389
the plants really going to select for

1062
00:40:42,588 --> 00:40:45,858
what it wants in the rhizosphere it's

1063
00:40:44,389 --> 00:40:48,049
gonna be putting out exudates that are

1064
00:40:45,858 --> 00:40:50,389
gonna feed specific microorganisms that

1065
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:51,980
are gonna either improve the pH or

1066
00:40:50,389 --> 00:40:54,469
increase the availability of whatever

1067
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:55,730
nutrients it's lacking or wants and so

1068
00:40:54,469 --> 00:41:00,199
we're not really in control of that

1069
00:40:55,730 --> 00:41:02,449
process now if we talk about fungal the

1070
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:04,219
bacterial ratios which is something that

1071
00:41:02,449 --> 00:41:06,529
I know the soil food web people get

1072
00:41:04,219 --> 00:41:09,848
pretty pretty far into down the rabbit

1073
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:13,730
hole yes it's true when we talk about

1074
00:41:09,849 --> 00:41:15,380
old-growth forests versus undisturbed or

1075
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:17,088
when we talk about old-growth forests

1076
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:20,059
versus Prairie lands they have very

1077
00:41:17,088 --> 00:41:22,369
different levels of fungal activity and

1078
00:41:20,059 --> 00:41:24,828
fungal growth and biomass relative to

1079
00:41:22,369 --> 00:41:29,240
bacteria but when we're talking about

1080
00:41:24,829 --> 00:41:33,079
growing in container media or growing

1081
00:41:29,239 --> 00:41:35,479
cannabis in you know in as an

1082
00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:38,030
agricultural crop it's a very different

1083
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:39,500
situation and I think what we want to do

1084
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:41,930
there is just put out all the microbes

1085
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:45,349
we can and really let the plants control

1086
00:41:41,929 --> 00:41:47,509
that process so if you make compost tea

1087
00:41:45,349 --> 00:41:50,329
correctly you'll have good levels of

1088
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:53,300
fungal activity and there's always going

1089
00:41:50,329 --> 00:41:55,220
to be bacteria in your tea and you can

1090
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:56,750
adjust all of this based on your brew

1091
00:41:55,219 --> 00:41:58,818
length so that's the other thing people

1092
00:41:56,750 --> 00:42:01,429
talk about bacterial foods versus fungal

1093
00:41:58,818 --> 00:42:02,009
foods really the easiest way to adjust

1094
00:42:01,429 --> 00:42:04,259
your

1095
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:06,089
the amount of bacteria and funguses just

1096
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:08,730
to adjust to the length of time you're

1097
00:42:06,088 --> 00:42:12,570
brewing so when you first brew that's

1098
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:13,949
first let's say 8 to 16 hours and again

1099
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:16,309
these are these are gonna vary every

1100
00:42:13,949 --> 00:42:19,348
brew and also based on your environment

1101
00:42:16,309 --> 00:42:21,659
air temperature elevation water source

1102
00:42:19,349 --> 00:42:24,660
all these things are gonna have slight

1103
00:42:21,659 --> 00:42:27,299
views so this is a very general thing

1104
00:42:24,659 --> 00:42:29,098
I'm saying here but 8 to 12 hours or 8

1105
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:31,859
to 16 hours a lot of bacteria is gonna

1106
00:42:29,099 --> 00:42:34,380
grow and then sort of that let's say 16

1107
00:42:31,858 --> 00:42:35,549
to 18 to 24 hours is when the the fungus

1108
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:37,559
will start to grow and then when we

1109
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:41,880
start talking about going 36 hours or

1110
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:43,380
longer 36 to 48 hours we're gonna have a

1111
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:46,440
lot more flageolets and things like that

1112
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:48,210
taking off and then over time we're

1113
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:49,409
gonna we're just losing diversity at

1114
00:42:48,210 --> 00:42:52,470
that point so I don't like to brew

1115
00:42:49,409 --> 00:42:53,969
beyond 36 hours because we're gonna keep

1116
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:56,250
you know certain microbes are gonna be

1117
00:42:53,969 --> 00:42:58,769
more efficient at consuming the

1118
00:42:56,250 --> 00:43:01,320
nutrients or each other you know other

1119
00:42:58,769 --> 00:43:04,829
microbes in that tea so Oh after 36

1120
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:06,539
hours diversity drops quite a bit so if

1121
00:43:04,829 --> 00:43:08,818
people want to start playing around with

1122
00:43:06,539 --> 00:43:10,469
that you know do a brew in 24 hours do

1123
00:43:08,818 --> 00:43:12,529
your next beer at 36 hours you don't

1124
00:43:10,469 --> 00:43:15,088
have to change your inputs necessarily

1125
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:17,970
okay but in the name of diversity still

1126
00:43:15,088 --> 00:43:20,369
want that 8 to 16 hour brew for the

1127
00:43:17,969 --> 00:43:22,049
bacteria as well well you're gonna have

1128
00:43:20,369 --> 00:43:24,650
the bacteria the bacteria is gonna keep

1129
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:27,150
growing so I don't worry about getting

1130
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:28,650
you're gonna have bacteria in teas no

1131
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:31,260
matter what so even if we talk about

1132
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:32,880
like a fungal dominant II they're still

1133
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:34,410
gonna be a lot of bacteria that's the

1134
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:36,599
thing it's not like a one or the other

1135
00:43:34,409 --> 00:43:37,980
sort of thing whereas it's just not

1136
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:42,030
gonna have the fungal content that you

1137
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:45,750
made but the flagellants bacteria or am

1138
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:48,180
i wrong no you're right they do so your

1139
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:49,650
bacterial levels will fluctuate but that

1140
00:43:48,179 --> 00:43:51,659
does the flageolets are gonna take a

1141
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:53,910
little longer to get going so at 24

1142
00:43:51,659 --> 00:43:55,799
hours 36 hours you still have a quite a

1143
00:43:53,909 --> 00:43:58,500
bit of bacteria if you want a tea that's

1144
00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:01,440
just going to be mostly bacteria you

1145
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:04,260
know use a sugar source use your compost

1146
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:07,889
and apply it it you know let's say 18 to

1147
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:10,560
20 hours okay awesome

1148
00:44:07,889 --> 00:44:12,299
so um kind of on that note is you're a

1149
00:44:10,559 --> 00:44:15,358
brand a compost tea sprayer that you'd

1150
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:16,048
recommend oh that's a tough question

1151
00:44:15,358 --> 00:44:18,150
I

1152
00:44:16,048 --> 00:44:19,978
haven't looked into it recently you know

1153
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:24,179
we have a commercial sprayer that we use

1154
00:44:19,978 --> 00:44:29,159
that I tested with a microscope myself

1155
00:44:24,179 --> 00:44:30,900
but what I would say is there are there

1156
00:44:29,159 --> 00:44:32,368
are companies out there doing that DRAM

1157
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:35,969
is the first one that pops to mind

1158
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:37,259
that's DRA mm I've had there there

1159
00:44:35,969 --> 00:44:40,650
heading one of their head guys Kurt

1160
00:44:37,259 --> 00:44:42,389
Becker on the podcast they're great they

1161
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:43,709
I'm sure they have a sprayer if you

1162
00:44:42,389 --> 00:44:45,058
can't afford one of their sprayers

1163
00:44:43,708 --> 00:44:46,858
because they are gonna be more expensive

1164
00:44:45,059 --> 00:44:50,400
you know let's say you just had a small

1165
00:44:46,858 --> 00:44:53,548
home grill go with a pump sprayer over

1166
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:56,099
an electric sprayer even just something

1167
00:44:53,548 --> 00:44:58,199
like a sump pump with your finger over

1168
00:44:56,099 --> 00:45:01,769
the end of a hose is a better option

1169
00:44:58,199 --> 00:45:03,539
than a lot of these other sprayers don't

1170
00:45:01,768 --> 00:45:05,968
put compost tea in those little tiny

1171
00:45:03,539 --> 00:45:07,619
spray bottles that you squeeze with your

1172
00:45:05,969 --> 00:45:10,108
finger you know they can have a trigger

1173
00:45:07,619 --> 00:45:12,749
on them and they may hold like a let's

1174
00:45:10,108 --> 00:45:14,969
say a quart of water those will kill

1175
00:45:12,748 --> 00:45:18,899
your microbes don't put compost tea in

1176
00:45:14,969 --> 00:45:21,659
an atomizer as long as you keep in mind

1177
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:24,568
it's a living organism and we want to we

1178
00:45:21,659 --> 00:45:27,328
want to apply a high volume at lower

1179
00:45:24,568 --> 00:45:29,159
pressure at lower pressure then you

1180
00:45:27,329 --> 00:45:31,199
should be okay so larger drop droplet

1181
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:33,989
size is better than a smaller droplet

1182
00:45:31,199 --> 00:45:35,639
size for example you know arcing motion

1183
00:45:33,989 --> 00:45:37,318
with the application rather than

1184
00:45:35,639 --> 00:45:39,629
slamming the microorganisms at high

1185
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:41,188
pressure into a you know into a leaf

1186
00:45:39,630 --> 00:45:44,579
surface or into the ground is going to

1187
00:45:41,188 --> 00:45:47,248
be better what I usually do with my

1188
00:45:44,579 --> 00:45:49,199
applications if it's not on scale is

1189
00:45:47,248 --> 00:45:50,368
just go around with a little bit of you

1190
00:45:49,199 --> 00:45:52,949
know go around with a cup and just give

1191
00:45:50,369 --> 00:45:54,358
each plant the pint or two of of compost

1192
00:45:52,949 --> 00:45:57,568
tea as I'm watering and I don't worry

1193
00:45:54,358 --> 00:45:59,068
about over applying it because it's just

1194
00:45:57,568 --> 00:46:02,038
beneficial microbes so that's not an

1195
00:45:59,068 --> 00:46:04,349
issue so if you are lucky enough to have

1196
00:46:02,039 --> 00:46:06,390
a microscope at home is it possible to

1197
00:46:04,349 --> 00:46:08,309
use whatever you spray you have sprayed

1198
00:46:06,389 --> 00:46:10,828
onto a slide look at it in the

1199
00:46:08,309 --> 00:46:12,839
microscope and tell if bacteria is still

1200
00:46:10,829 --> 00:46:14,160
alive Oh totally

1201
00:46:12,838 --> 00:46:16,558
yeah if you have a microscope that's

1202
00:46:14,159 --> 00:46:19,170
really that's the best way to do it I

1203
00:46:16,559 --> 00:46:20,969
would spray it into like a bucket from a

1204
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:22,318
little further away and then collect it

1205
00:46:20,969 --> 00:46:24,269
out of there making sure that you know

1206
00:46:22,318 --> 00:46:26,909
you clean the bucket ahead of time but

1207
00:46:24,268 --> 00:46:28,379
that way you want to you want to apply

1208
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:29,460
it like how you'd be applying it when

1209
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:30,720
you applied it to your Lisa

1210
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:33,750
so you'd want to stand a little further

1211
00:46:30,719 --> 00:46:35,759
back you know and apply it that way and

1212
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:37,550
try it both through the spare check it

1213
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:40,530
through the sprayer before the sprayer

1214
00:46:37,550 --> 00:46:42,030
since you brought up microscopes I know

1215
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:43,500
this isn't gonna apply to everyone but I

1216
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:45,569
want to give a calf you quick little

1217
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:46,920
pointers from Tim Wilson that he shared

1218
00:46:45,568 --> 00:46:49,679
with me back in the day that were really

1219
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:52,500
useful so when I started experimenting

1220
00:46:49,679 --> 00:46:55,078
with compost tea and using a microscope

1221
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:57,449
in terms of microscope recommendations I

1222
00:46:55,079 --> 00:47:00,750
have a guide that Tim Wilson put

1223
00:46:57,449 --> 00:47:03,509
together it's on gardening with microbes

1224
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:05,639
calm or microbe organics calm both have

1225
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:07,950
that guide available he put together a

1226
00:47:05,639 --> 00:47:11,279
really good description on there and

1227
00:47:07,949 --> 00:47:12,960
then what what he taught me is if I want

1228
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:16,260
to test out a compost or I want to test

1229
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:19,530
out how a compost responds to a food

1230
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:21,450
source it's very tedious to make up you

1231
00:47:19,530 --> 00:47:23,010
know a compost tea brew every single

1232
00:47:21,449 --> 00:47:24,808
time I want to do this you know that's a

1233
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:28,290
lot of brews or a lot of Brewers it gets

1234
00:47:24,809 --> 00:47:30,720
really expensive so what what we do is

1235
00:47:28,289 --> 00:47:35,130
we take I use a container that holds

1236
00:47:30,719 --> 00:47:36,298
about a cup of water and has a lid he I

1237
00:47:35,130 --> 00:47:38,130
mean you could do it in something even

1238
00:47:36,298 --> 00:47:40,190
smaller and then I figure out the ratios

1239
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:44,640
that I'm gonna be using in my brewer I

1240
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:47,548
add those amount into my container and

1241
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:49,440
that allows me to make up like let's

1242
00:47:47,548 --> 00:47:51,239
just call it a mini compost tea now

1243
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:53,789
obviously I can't aerate that very well

1244
00:47:51,239 --> 00:47:55,529
so what you'll do is you take it and you

1245
00:47:53,789 --> 00:47:57,480
shake it really really well for like

1246
00:47:55,530 --> 00:47:59,730
over a minute just get it as much oxygen

1247
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:02,400
there as possible and then take the lid

1248
00:47:59,730 --> 00:48:04,920
off and leave it out and then I'll come

1249
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:06,450
back by periodically every few hours and

1250
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:07,710
give it another put the lid back on give

1251
00:48:06,449 --> 00:48:12,058
another good shake take the lid off

1252
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:15,510
again and by doing that it simulates

1253
00:48:12,059 --> 00:48:18,089
enough of an oxygen response or keeps

1254
00:48:15,510 --> 00:48:20,040
enough oxygen in the in the water to

1255
00:48:18,088 --> 00:48:22,650
allow us to get a kind of an idea of

1256
00:48:20,039 --> 00:48:26,489
what the compost tea would look like and

1257
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:28,858
so I'll set up like you know 12 or 15

1258
00:48:26,489 --> 00:48:31,318
different things you know testing it

1259
00:48:28,858 --> 00:48:34,769
this if I want to test a compost I'll do

1260
00:48:31,318 --> 00:48:36,358
this compost plus distilled water then I

1261
00:48:34,769 --> 00:48:37,949
always use distilled water because it's

1262
00:48:36,358 --> 00:48:40,318
just going to be the cleanest water

1263
00:48:37,949 --> 00:48:41,759
possible and I'm not so I know I'm not

1264
00:48:40,318 --> 00:48:43,199
contaminating with other microbes and

1265
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:46,109
I'm not using water that canes

1266
00:48:43,199 --> 00:48:48,838
that's gonna kill microbes and then I'll

1267
00:48:46,108 --> 00:48:52,170
say this compost + molasses this compost

1268
00:48:48,838 --> 00:48:54,269
+ alfalfa meal this compost + our

1269
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:55,889
microbe catalyst and then I can be

1270
00:48:54,269 --> 00:48:58,800
surprised when you look under the tea at

1271
00:48:55,889 --> 00:49:02,608
you know 12 hours 18 hours 24 hours how

1272
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:05,700
much those teas very is shockingly

1273
00:49:02,608 --> 00:49:06,838
dramatic it's pretty cool and that's

1274
00:49:05,699 --> 00:49:08,549
where you can start trying out different

1275
00:49:06,838 --> 00:49:10,078
iterations and then once you have a good

1276
00:49:08,550 --> 00:49:12,240
idea of what direction you want to go if

1277
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:14,640
you're like okay wow you know like for

1278
00:49:12,239 --> 00:49:17,549
me and we noticed this using five

1279
00:49:14,639 --> 00:49:19,789
different hemic acids we saw microbial

1280
00:49:17,550 --> 00:49:21,990
suppression so it actually we got less

1281
00:49:19,789 --> 00:49:24,719
microbial growth than we did over just

1282
00:49:21,989 --> 00:49:26,909
compost and water and so when we did

1283
00:49:24,719 --> 00:49:28,559
that we said okay wow so let's test this

1284
00:49:26,909 --> 00:49:31,139
out so then we started doing you know

1285
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:34,289
full-size brews with Hema Casas and

1286
00:49:31,139 --> 00:49:36,719
found that we it actually supported that

1287
00:49:34,289 --> 00:49:38,190
at that result so this is sort of way to

1288
00:49:36,719 --> 00:49:40,409
test things out without having to make

1289
00:49:38,190 --> 00:49:41,820
up you know all these different compost

1290
00:49:40,409 --> 00:49:43,739
tea brews or if you have a large Brewer

1291
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:44,609
that's you know 100 gallons you don't

1292
00:49:43,739 --> 00:49:46,049
want to have to brew up a hundred

1293
00:49:44,608 --> 00:49:47,549
gallons of tea every time you want to

1294
00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:50,670
try something out that just doesn't it's

1295
00:49:47,550 --> 00:49:51,119
just not cost-effective okay yeah that

1296
00:49:50,670 --> 00:49:53,579
makes sense

1297
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:58,050
so really the takeaway is the diversity

1298
00:49:53,579 --> 00:50:00,060
of microbes right yes that's that's the

1299
00:49:58,050 --> 00:50:03,750
big takeaway when we talk about soil

1300
00:50:00,059 --> 00:50:06,650
health is diversity and we see it in

1301
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:08,789
nature everywhere it's not just in soils

1302
00:50:06,650 --> 00:50:09,930
everything is help is healthier with

1303
00:50:08,789 --> 00:50:12,000
diversity when we talk about our own

1304
00:50:09,929 --> 00:50:13,949
food and diets they always talk about

1305
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:17,219
diversity you know it's it's so

1306
00:50:13,949 --> 00:50:19,710
important to every ecosystem in all of

1307
00:50:17,219 --> 00:50:21,799
ecology it's not shocking that we need

1308
00:50:19,710 --> 00:50:24,329
to support that in our soils as well

1309
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:26,130
awesome cool well I want to shift gears

1310
00:50:24,329 --> 00:50:29,430
a little bit away from microbes right

1311
00:50:26,130 --> 00:50:31,289
now I have a question here have you have

1312
00:50:29,429 --> 00:50:33,358
any have you read any scientific studies

1313
00:50:31,289 --> 00:50:35,730
or very discussion about the intentional

1314
00:50:33,358 --> 00:50:38,460
stress in your plants yeah this is a

1315
00:50:35,730 --> 00:50:40,079
good one um I've talked about it a

1316
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:41,280
little bit in past podcast but I like

1317
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:42,990
that someone asked this question on

1318
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:44,579
Instagram because it's something that I

1319
00:50:42,989 --> 00:50:48,149
hear quite a bit around cannabis it's a

1320
00:50:44,579 --> 00:50:49,829
really really interesting topic what I

1321
00:50:48,150 --> 00:50:51,650
would say is this so yes there is

1322
00:50:49,829 --> 00:50:53,670
research out there that shows that

1323
00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:55,759
stressing a plan is going to cause it to

1324
00:50:53,670 --> 00:50:57,168
put more energy into

1325
00:50:55,759 --> 00:50:59,869
you know certain things that we wanted

1326
00:50:57,168 --> 00:51:02,568
to produce like fruit or it's you know

1327
00:50:59,869 --> 00:51:04,608
in this case it's flower it thinks so it

1328
00:51:02,568 --> 00:51:05,778
thinks it's dying you know our slow Lisa

1329
00:51:04,608 --> 00:51:07,699
messing and it's going to put more

1330
00:51:05,778 --> 00:51:09,469
energy into those things or the things

1331
00:51:07,699 --> 00:51:11,509
that help protect the plants defense

1332
00:51:09,469 --> 00:51:13,789
mechanisms which in this case is the

1333
00:51:11,509 --> 00:51:15,588
trichomes and you hear these stories

1334
00:51:13,789 --> 00:51:17,778
it's so funny as a grill every grower

1335
00:51:15,588 --> 00:51:19,728
knows that we're like oh man I had this

1336
00:51:17,778 --> 00:51:23,119
plant it looked terrible I threw it out

1337
00:51:19,728 --> 00:51:25,308
in the compost pile or I just that

1338
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:28,969
something went wrong this grow cycle and

1339
00:51:25,309 --> 00:51:30,380
all my plants freaked out and yield went

1340
00:51:28,969 --> 00:51:31,608
down but oh my gosh

1341
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:33,829
this is the best bud I've ever grown

1342
00:51:31,608 --> 00:51:36,139
this stuff just finished so good you

1343
00:51:33,829 --> 00:51:37,548
know such a common story right and

1344
00:51:36,139 --> 00:51:39,469
that's where we're talking about that

1345
00:51:37,548 --> 00:51:43,699
plant stress creating a response that's

1346
00:51:39,469 --> 00:51:45,769
positive but all that being said I just

1347
00:51:43,699 --> 00:51:49,519
can't get behind us stressing our plants

1348
00:51:45,768 --> 00:51:51,558
because one I think the most important

1349
00:51:49,518 --> 00:51:54,379
thing to keep in mind is pretty much

1350
00:51:51,559 --> 00:51:56,809
every grow I've ever been to already has

1351
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:58,189
plant stress going on at some level

1352
00:51:56,809 --> 00:51:59,809
there's already there's so much going on

1353
00:51:58,188 --> 00:52:02,598
which is so hard to maintain maintain

1354
00:51:59,809 --> 00:52:03,528
the optimal conditions that I think most

1355
00:52:02,599 --> 00:52:06,949
plants are going to be stressed

1356
00:52:03,528 --> 00:52:08,809
naturally so that's something to factor

1357
00:52:06,949 --> 00:52:10,989
in secondly we don't really know at what

1358
00:52:08,809 --> 00:52:14,569
stage a plant growth or at what point

1359
00:52:10,989 --> 00:52:17,449
with what genetics this these stressors

1360
00:52:14,568 --> 00:52:18,708
are going to be most beneficial so you

1361
00:52:17,449 --> 00:52:21,739
know I know people will drop

1362
00:52:18,708 --> 00:52:24,048
temperatures people will water with cold

1363
00:52:21,739 --> 00:52:26,539
water or stop watering or stop adding

1364
00:52:24,048 --> 00:52:28,969
nutrients and everyone claims different

1365
00:52:26,539 --> 00:52:30,709
results the research just hasn't been

1366
00:52:28,969 --> 00:52:33,229
there yet in my opinion to really say

1367
00:52:30,708 --> 00:52:35,388
that one method is is the way to go so

1368
00:52:33,228 --> 00:52:36,648
at this point I just I try to eliminate

1369
00:52:35,389 --> 00:52:38,539
plant stress as much as possible

1370
00:52:36,648 --> 00:52:41,449
realizing fully that it's still going to

1371
00:52:38,539 --> 00:52:44,479
occur and until we can find more

1372
00:52:41,449 --> 00:52:45,679
research on it specifically for cannabis

1373
00:52:44,478 --> 00:52:49,518
because there already is this research

1374
00:52:45,679 --> 00:52:50,929
around other crops I've seen I think

1375
00:52:49,518 --> 00:52:52,248
I've talked about this too but it was

1376
00:52:50,929 --> 00:52:54,769
really interesting I read a study about

1377
00:52:52,248 --> 00:52:56,238
how and I believe it was Italy with

1378
00:52:54,768 --> 00:52:59,358
their Tomatoes they would flood their

1379
00:52:56,239 --> 00:53:01,909
fields with salt water and that salinity

1380
00:52:59,358 --> 00:53:05,028
would stress the tomatoes and create a

1381
00:53:01,909 --> 00:53:06,949
much more flavorful higher an

1382
00:53:05,028 --> 00:53:09,199
antioxidant tomato and they had the

1383
00:53:06,949 --> 00:53:09,700
timing of this all down so it's really

1384
00:53:09,199 --> 00:53:12,460
interesting

1385
00:53:09,699 --> 00:53:14,349
but do we know where that that point or

1386
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:16,389
how that exists with cannabis at this

1387
00:53:14,349 --> 00:53:19,059
point in time I would say no more

1388
00:53:16,389 --> 00:53:22,719
research is needed yes sure definitely

1389
00:53:19,059 --> 00:53:24,369
ha ha nice cool all right so you can

1390
00:53:22,719 --> 00:53:26,379
repeat a lot of really cool people over

1391
00:53:24,369 --> 00:53:28,179
the years on your podcast which of the

1392
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:31,300
creative methods have you incorporated

1393
00:53:28,179 --> 00:53:34,599
into your own home garden yeah you know

1394
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:36,490
I've I've been really fortunate that

1395
00:53:34,599 --> 00:53:38,409
I've gotten I've gotten to interview

1396
00:53:36,489 --> 00:53:40,209
some really really intelligent people

1397
00:53:38,409 --> 00:53:43,569
and that have done some really

1398
00:53:40,210 --> 00:53:45,690
incredible work for me in terms of what

1399
00:53:43,570 --> 00:53:48,490
if when we talk about my own home garden

1400
00:53:45,690 --> 00:53:49,480
the things that I've incorporated on my

1401
00:53:48,489 --> 00:53:51,969
farm

1402
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:53,469
were the stuff from Steve Solomon in the

1403
00:53:51,969 --> 00:53:55,809
intelligent gardener so I started

1404
00:53:53,469 --> 00:53:59,500
experimenting more with soil testing

1405
00:53:55,809 --> 00:54:02,769
Andrea mending to to start balancing out

1406
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:04,449
these nutrients before you know I was

1407
00:54:02,769 --> 00:54:07,300
just sort of in that soil food web cam

1408
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:08,889
food web camp where we would just add we

1409
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:10,539
would just focus on biology this idea

1410
00:54:08,889 --> 00:54:12,549
that if you got the biology right that

1411
00:54:10,539 --> 00:54:14,259
all the nutrients would come into play

1412
00:54:12,550 --> 00:54:15,610
and the plant would handle it and you

1413
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:17,410
wouldn't have to worry about it and I

1414
00:54:15,610 --> 00:54:19,050
just I just don't I just don't buy into

1415
00:54:17,409 --> 00:54:21,549
that anymore

1416
00:54:19,050 --> 00:54:23,340
you know when we start talking as I've

1417
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:26,250
gotten to meet a lot of soil scientists

1418
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:28,930
and people that are really active in

1419
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:30,099
ecology and things like that it just

1420
00:54:28,929 --> 00:54:32,049
doesn't add up

1421
00:54:30,099 --> 00:54:35,650
you know the research supports the idea

1422
00:54:32,050 --> 00:54:39,580
that if we can create if we can add

1423
00:54:35,650 --> 00:54:41,889
nutrients to fix whatever limiting

1424
00:54:39,579 --> 00:54:43,900
factor of growth there is then we're

1425
00:54:41,889 --> 00:54:45,730
gonna have a healthier plant and not all

1426
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:47,619
soils contain the same levels of every

1427
00:54:45,730 --> 00:54:50,889
nutrient I mean it's pretty it's it's

1428
00:54:47,619 --> 00:54:52,569
pretty obvious stuff so we want to make

1429
00:54:50,889 --> 00:54:54,940
sure that we're getting the plants the

1430
00:54:52,570 --> 00:54:55,900
nutrients it needs and making putting

1431
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:57,700
them in a form that's gonna be

1432
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:59,889
accessible to the plants so it can be as

1433
00:54:57,699 --> 00:55:01,839
healthy as possible so the stuff from

1434
00:54:59,889 --> 00:55:04,299
Steve Steve Solomon I don't totally

1435
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:06,280
agree with all of his targets when it

1436
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:08,980
comes to cannabis I think it's a good

1437
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:12,370
starting point and I think people can

1438
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:14,740
get too caught up with soil tests so I

1439
00:55:12,369 --> 00:55:17,259
don't want to say you know go too far

1440
00:55:14,739 --> 00:55:19,269
down any one path but I do think that a

1441
00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:22,030
lot of what he says I love the

1442
00:55:19,269 --> 00:55:23,349
introduction chapter introduction

1443
00:55:22,030 --> 00:55:25,360
introduction to his book if you

1444
00:55:23,349 --> 00:55:26,799
read nothing else in the intelligent

1445
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:28,210
gardener or the numbers are too much

1446
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:30,940
just read his introduction because it

1447
00:55:28,210 --> 00:55:32,349
starts making you think about nutrients

1448
00:55:30,940 --> 00:55:35,889
and soil testing in a way that I think

1449
00:55:32,349 --> 00:55:38,349
is really powerful I do I do really

1450
00:55:35,889 --> 00:55:42,069
appreciate the work that dr. Ingham did

1451
00:55:38,349 --> 00:55:45,549
in bringing attention to soil microbes

1452
00:55:42,070 --> 00:55:47,920
in the soil food web I think that that

1453
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:49,300
has a lot of value and that's sort of

1454
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:51,460
like I said where I started my path

1455
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:53,860
because of my father and his compost tea

1456
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:56,440
business so I'm indebted to her for that

1457
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:59,650
I don't I don't agree with everything

1458
00:55:56,440 --> 00:56:01,720
that she says regarding bacterial or

1459
00:55:59,650 --> 00:56:04,059
fungal ratios and the stuff around

1460
00:56:01,719 --> 00:56:05,500
nutrients but again there's a lot of

1461
00:56:04,059 --> 00:56:07,420
ways to grow a plant and I don't want to

1462
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:09,760
you know I don't want to come a come

1463
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:12,099
across too harsh when we're talking

1464
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:15,640
about all of these different sort of

1465
00:56:12,099 --> 00:56:17,679
ideologies around growing one thing I've

1466
00:56:15,639 --> 00:56:20,109
had conversations off-air with people

1467
00:56:17,679 --> 00:56:23,730
about is when I think I think when you

1468
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:27,940
get too into any one of these paths

1469
00:56:23,730 --> 00:56:30,429
whether it's you know KNF for probiotic

1470
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:34,179
farming or ba dynamics or soil food web

1471
00:56:30,429 --> 00:56:35,199
or nutrient dense farming or natural

1472
00:56:34,179 --> 00:56:36,460
farming you know there's all these

1473
00:56:35,199 --> 00:56:38,949
different groups that are all slightly

1474
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:40,659
different there all of those are on the

1475
00:56:38,949 --> 00:56:43,359
organic side too which is awesome

1476
00:56:40,659 --> 00:56:45,809
but they almost start to feel a little

1477
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:48,490
more like a religion then like a

1478
00:56:45,809 --> 00:56:52,299
methodology and I think that's where I

1479
00:56:48,489 --> 00:56:54,250
sort of I think that's sort of where I

1480
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:57,310
separate because I don't think you need

1481
00:56:54,250 --> 00:57:00,340
to bury a cow horn on a full moon to

1482
00:56:57,309 --> 00:57:02,349
grow a healthy plant necessarily you

1483
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:03,820
know and that's not to say that's a bad

1484
00:57:02,349 --> 00:57:06,099
practice like if people want to go on

1485
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:07,720
doing that fine you know but like for me

1486
00:57:06,099 --> 00:57:09,549
I'll take bit I kind of take bits and

1487
00:57:07,719 --> 00:57:11,619
pieces from all of these guys and then

1488
00:57:09,550 --> 00:57:15,190
figure out what fits was sort of not

1489
00:57:11,619 --> 00:57:16,869
only just my my growing methodology but

1490
00:57:15,190 --> 00:57:18,909
also just sort of my like moral and

1491
00:57:16,869 --> 00:57:22,420
ethical code and what feels right for me

1492
00:57:18,909 --> 00:57:25,059
in my soil like some people it's really

1493
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:27,099
important to them to you know plant with

1494
00:57:25,059 --> 00:57:28,360
the moon and that's great I'd have no

1495
00:57:27,099 --> 00:57:30,839
issues of that I don't want to say it's

1496
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:33,940
good or bad what I would love to do is

1497
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:35,680
try it out run a study see do I get

1498
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:36,820
better results you know all other

1499
00:57:35,679 --> 00:57:39,629
variables being the

1500
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:44,080
if I plant when the moon is at a certain

1501
00:57:39,630 --> 00:57:45,400
certain stage in its cycle so my thing

1502
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:47,049
is let's let's take a critical eye to

1503
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:48,880
all of these approaches and then try and

1504
00:57:47,050 --> 00:57:50,970
figure out what aspects of them or what

1505
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:55,210
really makes them successful its kind of

1506
00:57:50,969 --> 00:57:56,769
focus on that part of it so for me

1507
00:57:55,210 --> 00:57:58,420
Steve Solomon I know I'm getting off

1508
00:57:56,769 --> 00:57:59,380
topic here but Steve Solomon was really

1509
00:57:58,420 --> 00:58:01,329
big

1510
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:03,670
I think Jeff Jeff's book teeming with

1511
00:58:01,329 --> 00:58:06,579
microbes is a really good starting point

1512
00:58:03,670 --> 00:58:08,320
for learning about microbes oh yeah and

1513
00:58:06,579 --> 00:58:11,099
so he kind of got me thinking about that

1514
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:13,990
I think the one he's had the biggest

1515
00:58:11,099 --> 00:58:17,230
impact on me just off the top of my head

1516
00:58:13,989 --> 00:58:21,179
cuz I don't know I may I may think of

1517
00:58:17,230 --> 00:58:23,980
others down the road would probably be

1518
00:58:21,179 --> 00:58:26,980
Suzanne Wainwright Evans so this idea of

1519
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:27,940
entomology and bio controls was just a

1520
00:58:26,980 --> 00:58:30,099
whole new world to me

1521
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:31,900
and it really got me thinking more about

1522
00:58:30,099 --> 00:58:34,690
insects in the insect world and that's

1523
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:36,430
been really fun getting a dino light and

1524
00:58:34,690 --> 00:58:40,389
starting to look at insects has been

1525
00:58:36,429 --> 00:58:42,819
just a blast I think Nelson Linsley is

1526
00:58:40,389 --> 00:58:46,269
probably the podcast that most opened my

1527
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:49,690
mind to different ideas in this idea of

1528
00:58:46,269 --> 00:58:51,489
sort of a hybrid approach using you know

1529
00:58:49,690 --> 00:58:53,260
ionic nutrients in a more sustainable

1530
00:58:51,489 --> 00:58:55,419
method which I thought was really

1531
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:57,400
interesting you know giant Palmer is a

1532
00:58:55,420 --> 00:59:00,579
great friend of mine so having him on

1533
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:01,900
was was a lot of fun and and him and I

1534
00:59:00,579 --> 00:59:04,630
have worked together for years on

1535
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:08,260
research side of things so that was

1536
00:59:04,630 --> 00:59:10,480
great and then I think what I think

1537
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:12,940
probably the most useful like the most

1538
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:14,679
powerful podcast I did might go to dr.

1539
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:17,050
Allison justice and some of the research

1540
00:59:14,679 --> 00:59:19,419
she shared that they've done I thought

1541
00:59:17,050 --> 00:59:24,100
that was pretty amazing if I had to pick

1542
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:25,599
like a best of podcast but yeah you know

1543
00:59:24,099 --> 00:59:27,880
I learned something from every guest and

1544
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:29,769
it's so much fun so that's I think

1545
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:31,900
that's the coolest thing is I'm always

1546
00:59:29,769 --> 00:59:34,329
learning and I hope that never changes

1547
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:36,700
right and as we all should and I think

1548
00:59:34,329 --> 00:59:39,549
it's great advice to compile bits and

1549
00:59:36,699 --> 00:59:42,399
pieces from all different aspects of

1550
00:59:39,550 --> 00:59:43,840
your education to get a method that

1551
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:46,450
works for you you know everybody's

1552
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:48,610
different and you know there's more than

1553
00:59:46,449 --> 00:59:50,289
one way to do things and that's that's

1554
00:59:48,610 --> 00:59:52,870
an awesome stuff that I love it

1555
00:59:50,289 --> 00:59:53,969
sweet so I got one last question here

1556
00:59:52,869 --> 00:59:56,589
and it's it's a doozy

1557
00:59:53,969 --> 00:59:58,719
so what challenges have you faced

1558
00:59:56,590 --> 01:00:00,579
running an independent nursery in an age

1559
00:59:58,719 --> 01:00:03,099
when they are rapidly disappearing

1560
01:00:00,579 --> 01:00:04,989
how do you stay independent yet relevant

1561
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:06,819
in an increasingly commodified

1562
01:00:04,989 --> 01:00:09,250
marketplace while still paying the bills

1563
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:11,500
what books are you reading that relate

1564
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:12,849
to your working professional growth okay

1565
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:14,409
let me come back to the book question

1566
01:00:12,849 --> 01:00:16,150
cuz I that's probably the one I'm the

1567
01:00:14,409 --> 01:00:17,710
most excited about right now talking

1568
01:00:16,150 --> 01:00:20,530
about I know we talked about that pre

1569
01:00:17,710 --> 01:00:23,320
podcast but we sure let me focus on the

1570
01:00:20,530 --> 01:00:24,640
first one so you asked could you repeat

1571
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:27,519
the first part of that question that was

1572
01:00:24,639 --> 01:00:29,469
yes sorry alright so um what challenges

1573
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:31,269
have you faced running an independent

1574
01:00:29,469 --> 01:00:36,429
nursery and engage when they are roughly

1575
01:00:31,269 --> 01:00:40,659
just spirit okay so when I started kis

1576
01:00:36,429 --> 01:00:42,519
organics and set up kis farm I was

1577
01:00:40,659 --> 01:00:46,420
getting really into Victory Gardens and

1578
01:00:42,519 --> 01:00:49,570
there was no there was no feed store in

1579
01:00:46,420 --> 01:00:52,780
Redmond so to be fair that you know we

1580
01:00:49,570 --> 01:00:54,700
had the compost tea business I'd started

1581
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:57,400
mixing soils just to experiment from my

1582
01:00:54,699 --> 01:01:00,129
own growing purposes but I hadn't really

1583
01:00:57,400 --> 01:01:01,720
dived into it that far and we got this

1584
01:01:00,130 --> 01:01:03,519
seven acre property back that was

1585
01:01:01,719 --> 01:01:04,899
beautiful you know my parents had had a

1586
01:01:03,519 --> 01:01:08,079
nursery on there before there was a

1587
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:09,250
nursery on there currently and I wanted

1588
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:11,909
to do something differently well

1589
01:01:09,250 --> 01:01:15,820
different with it I was getting into

1590
01:01:11,909 --> 01:01:17,559
chickens and free-range animals for for

1591
01:01:15,820 --> 01:01:20,740
growing your own your own food and I

1592
01:01:17,559 --> 01:01:22,750
thought urban farming was the future so

1593
01:01:20,739 --> 01:01:25,329
I kind of tailored the business around

1594
01:01:22,750 --> 01:01:27,489
that I didn't I wasn't very strong you

1595
01:01:25,329 --> 01:01:29,139
know I'm my mother made me do a business

1596
01:01:27,489 --> 01:01:31,179
plan back in the day because it was

1597
01:01:29,139 --> 01:01:33,519
their land and they were helping with

1598
01:01:31,179 --> 01:01:35,529
some investment money which I looking

1599
01:01:33,519 --> 01:01:37,869
back now I hated it but I think that was

1600
01:01:35,530 --> 01:01:40,510
really important I wasn't strong on the

1601
01:01:37,869 --> 01:01:42,880
business side at all I should have done

1602
01:01:40,510 --> 01:01:44,440
more research into how much money you

1603
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:48,519
actually get for lugging around a

1604
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:50,710
50-pound bag of chicken feed it's really

1605
01:01:48,519 --> 01:01:54,969
it's really a tough business so I think

1606
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:57,789
having looking back I wish I had been a

1607
01:01:54,969 --> 01:01:59,739
little less idealistic and a little more

1608
01:01:57,789 --> 01:02:02,170
pragmatic and done some more research so

1609
01:01:59,739 --> 01:02:03,509
I think I had a good idea but I didn't

1610
01:02:02,170 --> 01:02:05,579
really know

1611
01:02:03,510 --> 01:02:07,560
where that idea would take me so I also

1612
01:02:05,579 --> 01:02:10,380
thought you know there's all these cool

1613
01:02:07,559 --> 01:02:12,360
edibles out there I should offer unique

1614
01:02:10,380 --> 01:02:13,349
edibles and be an edible nursery no one

1615
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:15,840
else is doing this

1616
01:02:13,349 --> 01:02:18,000
this urban for the food thing is the

1617
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:19,320
future and so I just went with it and so

1618
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,000
we got all these we would spend all this

1619
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:24,809
money and got all these really cool

1620
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:29,190
edible plants really really cool plants

1621
01:02:24,809 --> 01:02:32,099
and frankly nobody cared so I was like

1622
01:02:29,190 --> 01:02:33,570
why did I do this you know and it takes

1623
01:02:32,099 --> 01:02:36,150
time too for things to catch on and

1624
01:02:33,570 --> 01:02:38,190
things to build and I didn't I think I

1625
01:02:36,150 --> 01:02:40,380
over diversified our business so we had

1626
01:02:38,190 --> 01:02:43,889
all these animals we had a preschool on

1627
01:02:40,380 --> 01:02:46,050
the property we have you know chickens

1628
01:02:43,889 --> 01:02:48,239
running around and ducks and goats and

1629
01:02:46,050 --> 01:02:50,789
pigs and we had we had this edible

1630
01:02:48,239 --> 01:02:53,729
nursery and we were trying to keep all

1631
01:02:50,789 --> 01:02:56,340
these plants alive and healthy and I was

1632
01:02:53,730 --> 01:02:58,740
expecting a staff to be able to know

1633
01:02:56,340 --> 01:03:02,190
about picking pigs and chickens and

1634
01:02:58,739 --> 01:03:04,289
ducks and you know gummy berries and

1635
01:03:02,190 --> 01:03:07,530
elderberries and apples and it was just

1636
01:03:04,289 --> 01:03:09,949
it was a lot and it was also too much -

1637
01:03:07,530 --> 01:03:11,940
for me trying to manage and run all this

1638
01:03:09,949 --> 01:03:13,710
one of the first things I learned is

1639
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:17,159
like I'm not a great manager or leader

1640
01:03:13,710 --> 01:03:19,019
of other people I'm very good at self

1641
01:03:17,159 --> 01:03:21,389
motivating and I think I can come up

1642
01:03:19,019 --> 01:03:23,849
with some good ideas but at the end of

1643
01:03:21,389 --> 01:03:25,500
the day like trying to trying to manage

1644
01:03:23,849 --> 01:03:29,460
this huge thing was really really

1645
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:32,699
challenging so looking back if I I think

1646
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:34,019
as if I looked at this business over

1647
01:03:32,699 --> 01:03:35,609
again I never would have done the

1648
01:03:34,019 --> 01:03:38,009
nursery because I just didn't have the

1649
01:03:35,610 --> 01:03:39,690
right staff in place to keep everything

1650
01:03:38,010 --> 01:03:41,340
healthy and alive because you really

1651
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:43,650
have to have a lot of plant knowledge to

1652
01:03:41,340 --> 01:03:45,180
have someone scouting and really

1653
01:03:43,650 --> 01:03:47,550
maintaining that and I couldn't give it

1654
01:03:45,179 --> 01:03:49,679
the energy that I needed because I was

1655
01:03:47,550 --> 01:03:51,690
too busy dealing with something else all

1656
01:03:49,679 --> 01:03:53,369
the time you know so we had we had a

1657
01:03:51,690 --> 01:03:55,829
whole greenhouse we plant out every year

1658
01:03:53,369 --> 01:03:57,299
and we we would we would do an okay job

1659
01:03:55,829 --> 01:03:58,590
but we could never keep up with weeding

1660
01:03:57,300 --> 01:04:00,990
because we didn't have enough staff and

1661
01:03:58,590 --> 01:04:03,180
then we'd have this whole nursery that

1662
01:04:00,989 --> 01:04:04,889
always looked okay but we weren't able

1663
01:04:03,179 --> 01:04:07,139
to always you know our irrigation would

1664
01:04:04,889 --> 01:04:08,969
break or we wouldn't we wouldn't catch

1665
01:04:07,139 --> 01:04:11,849
it you know a pest coming onto the

1666
01:04:08,969 --> 01:04:13,559
property fast enough little things like

1667
01:04:11,849 --> 01:04:15,150
that or our chickens would get feather

1668
01:04:13,559 --> 01:04:17,130
lice so there was always something

1669
01:04:15,150 --> 01:04:20,220
happening and so it always

1670
01:04:17,130 --> 01:04:21,630
like a crisis you know starting at

1671
01:04:20,219 --> 01:04:25,348
business is by far the hardest thing

1672
01:04:21,630 --> 01:04:28,289
I've ever done and it's uh I have

1673
01:04:25,349 --> 01:04:29,700
memories of you know working until 6:00

1674
01:04:28,289 --> 01:04:31,528
in the morning and the roosters crowing

1675
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:35,308
behind me and I'm still making up tea

1676
01:04:31,528 --> 01:04:36,630
brew kits in the garage or sleeping you

1677
01:04:35,309 --> 01:04:38,339
know in a tent on the back of the

1678
01:04:36,630 --> 01:04:39,838
property because I didn't want to take

1679
01:04:38,338 --> 01:04:41,849
the 15 minutes it would take me to

1680
01:04:39,838 --> 01:04:42,960
commute home and go in my own bed and

1681
01:04:41,849 --> 01:04:47,548
then go back to work the next morning

1682
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:49,199
you know so it was a lot and looking

1683
01:04:47,548 --> 01:04:51,268
back at it I don't regret a single

1684
01:04:49,199 --> 01:04:53,460
minute I think I wouldn't be the person

1685
01:04:51,268 --> 01:04:55,828
I am and I don't think I would have the

1686
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:58,409
business that I have if I hadn't done

1687
01:04:55,829 --> 01:05:01,200
those things but I think I could have

1688
01:04:58,409 --> 01:05:04,649
been a lot smarter about it and I think

1689
01:05:01,199 --> 01:05:07,919
that I could have set myself up to be a

1690
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:09,690
lot more successful had I had I been

1691
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:11,670
more strategic like put in a lot more

1692
01:05:09,690 --> 01:05:13,920
time on the planning side and less time

1693
01:05:11,670 --> 01:05:14,400
just trying to put out fires if that

1694
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:17,639
makes sense

1695
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:20,309
you asked about books right oh yeah yes

1696
01:05:17,639 --> 01:05:21,480
sorry the second part of that was um so

1697
01:05:20,309 --> 01:05:23,460
yeah well what books have you been

1698
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:27,088
reading that relate to your working

1699
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:28,650
professional growth yeah this one this

1700
01:05:27,088 --> 01:05:31,278
is probably the question that's most I'm

1701
01:05:28,650 --> 01:05:35,519
most passionate about right now because

1702
01:05:31,278 --> 01:05:37,079
my my values and things have stayed

1703
01:05:35,518 --> 01:05:38,639
fairly much the same throughout this

1704
01:05:37,079 --> 01:05:40,230
whole process like it was always really

1705
01:05:38,639 --> 01:05:43,108
important to me with our business that

1706
01:05:40,230 --> 01:05:45,088
we had we were an educational center

1707
01:05:43,108 --> 01:05:46,710
that all came from my parents mostly my

1708
01:05:45,088 --> 01:05:48,268
father he's just so passionate about

1709
01:05:46,710 --> 01:05:50,940
organics he's passionate about the

1710
01:05:48,268 --> 01:05:53,518
environment he's a big hippie and he

1711
01:05:50,940 --> 01:05:56,220
always will be and I love him for it you

1712
01:05:53,518 --> 01:05:59,068
know and he really shared this this

1713
01:05:56,219 --> 01:06:01,709
enjoyment of nature with me and so the

1714
01:05:59,068 --> 01:06:03,150
the ability to allow children and the

1715
01:06:01,710 --> 01:06:07,170
public to interact with these animals

1716
01:06:03,150 --> 01:06:09,720
and eat this healthy food and see this

1717
01:06:07,170 --> 01:06:12,470
growing process it's been invaluable

1718
01:06:09,719 --> 01:06:16,500
like I I don't regret that for a moment

1719
01:06:12,469 --> 01:06:18,389
and I think that you know the one key

1720
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:20,009
thing I would tell people is like stick

1721
01:06:18,389 --> 01:06:24,088
to your values that's the most important

1722
01:06:20,009 --> 01:06:26,338
thing like even though the farm itself

1723
01:06:24,088 --> 01:06:30,119
has not been particularly successful

1724
01:06:26,338 --> 01:06:30,989
relative to kiss organics it's been like

1725
01:06:30,119 --> 01:06:33,390
emotionally in

1726
01:06:30,989 --> 01:06:34,949
like spiritually valuable - not to the

1727
01:06:33,389 --> 01:06:37,409
community and to myself and to the

1728
01:06:34,949 --> 01:06:39,509
employees so that's all been really

1729
01:06:37,409 --> 01:06:41,159
really powerful and one of the things

1730
01:06:39,510 --> 01:06:43,020
some of the things I've learned over the

1731
01:06:41,159 --> 01:06:44,399
years now since then in running a

1732
01:06:43,019 --> 01:06:46,110
business is a lot of the books I've been

1733
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:48,630
reading so I want to give credit to my

1734
01:06:46,110 --> 01:06:50,910
wife because she is a marketing whiz and

1735
01:06:48,630 --> 01:06:52,590
she made me realize that like it's not

1736
01:06:50,909 --> 01:06:54,000
about having the best product and in

1737
01:06:52,590 --> 01:06:55,530
this case I'd say it's not about having

1738
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,179
the best cannabis you could be the best

1739
01:06:55,530 --> 01:07:00,030
grower in the world but if no one knows

1740
01:06:57,179 --> 01:07:02,118
about what you're growing you're not

1741
01:07:00,030 --> 01:07:06,540
gonna ever you're not gonna ever sell it

1742
01:07:02,119 --> 01:07:09,450
and so I I never I was always like

1743
01:07:06,539 --> 01:07:10,619
marketing advertising big deal I don't I

1744
01:07:09,449 --> 01:07:12,480
don't need to worry about that I don't

1745
01:07:10,619 --> 01:07:14,610
care about that I'm just gonna focus on

1746
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:17,809
what I'm good at and what I'm passionate

1747
01:07:14,610 --> 01:07:20,940
about which wasn't those things and I

1748
01:07:17,809 --> 01:07:22,829
regret that and for anyone starting a

1749
01:07:20,940 --> 01:07:24,570
cannabis business out nowadays that's

1750
01:07:22,829 --> 01:07:26,429
listening to this get your marketing

1751
01:07:24,570 --> 01:07:27,869
advertising going as soon as possible

1752
01:07:26,429 --> 01:07:30,929
that's the best piece of advice I can

1753
01:07:27,869 --> 01:07:34,010
get you build a brand and so like this

1754
01:07:30,929 --> 01:07:37,429
podcast was my way of doing that and

1755
01:07:34,010 --> 01:07:39,630
it's been such a wonderful experience so

1756
01:07:37,429 --> 01:07:41,489
I've learned that marketing in

1757
01:07:39,630 --> 01:07:42,900
advertising doesn't have to be a

1758
01:07:41,489 --> 01:07:45,000
negative thing it doesn't have to be a

1759
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:46,829
drag it doesn't have to be gimmicky I

1760
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:48,869
think if you can if you can find your

1761
01:07:46,829 --> 01:07:51,299
message and make it real that's really

1762
01:07:48,869 --> 01:07:54,320
really powerful and some of the latest

1763
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:56,820
things on the marketing advertising

1764
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:58,920
piece that the two books that I really

1765
01:07:56,820 --> 01:08:00,630
enjoyed was contagious by Jonah Berger

1766
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:03,119
and you can go on YouTube and look him

1767
01:08:00,630 --> 01:08:04,920
up he's got a lot of talks so

1768
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:07,170
interesting we talk about science and

1769
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:08,820
what makes ideas

1770
01:08:07,170 --> 01:08:12,420
what makes ideas stick and what makes

1771
01:08:08,820 --> 01:08:14,130
ideas take off I love his books and made

1772
01:08:12,420 --> 01:08:16,230
the stick by chip Heath is another one

1773
01:08:14,130 --> 01:08:19,020
along those lines you know you can get a

1774
01:08:16,229 --> 01:08:20,759
lot of good gems out of that but then

1775
01:08:19,020 --> 01:08:23,549
when we talk about like books that have

1776
01:08:20,759 --> 01:08:26,220
changed the way I run my business on the

1777
01:08:23,548 --> 01:08:27,420
business side there's a really really

1778
01:08:26,220 --> 01:08:29,640
good book called never split the

1779
01:08:27,420 --> 01:08:31,949
difference by Chris Foss I think

1780
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:33,359
everyone should read it saved me twelve

1781
01:08:31,949 --> 01:08:35,670
hundred dollars within the first week of

1782
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:38,460
reading it it's the it's a good book

1783
01:08:35,670 --> 01:08:41,338
about a guy who was like a he was a

1784
01:08:38,460 --> 01:08:43,279
terrorist negotiation expert like the

1785
01:08:41,338 --> 01:08:44,988
head of it for the FBI

1786
01:08:43,279 --> 01:08:47,299
and so he talks about all these all of

1787
01:08:44,988 --> 01:08:51,709
his experiences from you know talking

1788
01:08:47,298 --> 01:08:53,538
people out of you know talking people

1789
01:08:51,710 --> 01:08:56,059
off the edge edge of a building to

1790
01:08:53,538 --> 01:08:57,710
buying a car and he just made me

1791
01:08:56,059 --> 01:08:58,338
realized that like everything in life is

1792
01:08:57,710 --> 01:09:02,569
negotiable

1793
01:08:58,338 --> 01:09:05,088
and it or is a negotiation and the book

1794
01:09:02,569 --> 01:09:07,159
is hilarious and so powerful everyone

1795
01:09:05,088 --> 01:09:09,109
should read it the book I'm reading

1796
01:09:07,158 --> 01:09:11,808
right now is called the 80/20 principle

1797
01:09:09,109 --> 01:09:13,789
and I think that's another book that's a

1798
01:09:11,809 --> 01:09:16,239
must read I learned about it from the

1799
01:09:13,788 --> 01:09:18,469
4-hour workweek with Timothy Ferriss and

1800
01:09:16,238 --> 01:09:19,669
I don't want to say that you should

1801
01:09:18,469 --> 01:09:21,948
necessarily read the Timothy Ferriss

1802
01:09:19,670 --> 01:09:24,949
book because it's he's a lot as you and

1803
01:09:21,948 --> 01:09:26,598
I were talking about for sure so I don't

1804
01:09:24,948 --> 01:09:27,678
want to I don't want to necessarily say

1805
01:09:26,599 --> 01:09:29,538
that that's the book to read but the

1806
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:32,509
80/20 principle is fascinating it's this

1807
01:09:29,538 --> 01:09:34,908
idea that like 80% of your energy goes

1808
01:09:32,509 --> 01:09:36,380
into 20% of the things you're doing and

1809
01:09:34,908 --> 01:09:40,460
it doesn't have to equal 100 but this is

1810
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:42,828
just rough things or 80% of your revenue

1811
01:09:40,460 --> 01:09:45,439
comes from 20% of your clientele so why

1812
01:09:42,828 --> 01:09:48,519
not put your energy into that 20% or

1813
01:09:45,439 --> 01:09:52,638
what I would say is like probably like

1814
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:55,219
50 percent of my time goes to 5% of my

1815
01:09:52,639 --> 01:09:57,529
clients some people just require a lot

1816
01:09:55,219 --> 01:09:58,819
more hand-holding through this process

1817
01:09:57,529 --> 01:10:00,319
or they have complaints about your

1818
01:09:58,819 --> 01:10:01,368
products or they have all these

1819
01:10:00,319 --> 01:10:03,229
questions you're just constantly

1820
01:10:01,368 --> 01:10:05,899
spending time like pointing them to

1821
01:10:03,229 --> 01:10:09,078
links on the website you know or and

1822
01:10:05,899 --> 01:10:10,939
more information and what I'm learning

1823
01:10:09,078 --> 01:10:12,710
is like why are my putting all my energy

1824
01:10:10,939 --> 01:10:14,118
into those people when I can be putting

1825
01:10:12,710 --> 01:10:15,770
my energy into the part of the business

1826
01:10:14,118 --> 01:10:17,238
that's more important to me that I'm

1827
01:10:15,770 --> 01:10:19,579
more passionate about and that's more

1828
01:10:17,238 --> 01:10:21,169
profitable so that's a great book and

1829
01:10:19,578 --> 01:10:23,479
you can apply it to your life like if

1830
01:10:21,170 --> 01:10:25,279
you know 80% your happiness is coming

1831
01:10:23,479 --> 01:10:27,678
from the 10% of the time you're spent

1832
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:29,899
hiking how do you how do you change your

1833
01:10:27,679 --> 01:10:31,099
life to spend that time you know

1834
01:10:29,899 --> 01:10:32,359
increasing the amount of time that

1835
01:10:31,099 --> 01:10:32,960
you're doing doing the things that make

1836
01:10:32,359 --> 01:10:35,779
you happy

1837
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:38,149
like that nice so that's a great book

1838
01:10:35,779 --> 01:10:41,300
but it's all based for him in an economy

1839
01:10:38,149 --> 01:10:43,429
perspective so so that's fun too and

1840
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:44,869
then the last one I have to mention this

1841
01:10:43,429 --> 01:10:46,279
sort of a guy who's kind of become a

1842
01:10:44,868 --> 01:10:49,808
personal hero of mine over the last

1843
01:10:46,279 --> 01:10:52,429
couple years his name is Jesse it's leur

1844
01:10:49,809 --> 01:10:54,769
he's him and his wife are a lot of fun

1845
01:10:52,429 --> 01:10:57,079
to follow on Instagram she's the founder

1846
01:10:54,769 --> 01:10:58,640
of Spanx

1847
01:10:57,079 --> 01:11:00,890
which is so she's like a

1848
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:02,480
multi-millionaire in her own right but

1849
01:11:00,890 --> 01:11:06,680
he wrote a book called living with a

1850
01:11:02,479 --> 01:11:08,419
seal and this book is just it's one of

1851
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:10,400
the best books I've ever have ever read

1852
01:11:08,420 --> 01:11:13,100
it's so great it's hilarious and

1853
01:11:10,399 --> 01:11:15,879
powerful and he's also written a second

1854
01:11:13,100 --> 01:11:18,110
book called living with a monk and I

1855
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:20,119
can't recommend those books enough in

1856
01:11:18,109 --> 01:11:21,799
fact if I had to pick one book to tell

1857
01:11:20,119 --> 01:11:23,779
someone to read it be it'd be that book

1858
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:26,960
living with a seal by Jessie its lair

1859
01:11:23,779 --> 01:11:32,000
because it's just it's awesome it's this

1860
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:33,590
idea that we have the mental power to to

1861
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:35,239
really do whatever you want and do one

1862
01:11:33,590 --> 01:11:38,869
big thing every year you know there's no

1863
01:11:35,239 --> 01:11:40,219
reason we get stuck in these ruts where

1864
01:11:38,869 --> 01:11:42,140
we just go through life and do the same

1865
01:11:40,220 --> 01:11:44,900
thing over and over again and he really

1866
01:11:42,140 --> 01:11:47,240
challenges that in a way that I think is

1867
01:11:44,899 --> 01:11:49,009
really special so I'm now looking at my

1868
01:11:47,239 --> 01:11:51,769
life differently and thinking about how

1869
01:11:49,010 --> 01:11:53,600
do I you know what's really important to

1870
01:11:51,770 --> 01:11:55,940
me not just with my business but with my

1871
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:58,700
personal life and how do I value or take

1872
01:11:55,939 --> 01:12:00,500
the things that I value and really focus

1873
01:11:58,699 --> 01:12:02,989
on them and and the biggest thing is I'm

1874
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:04,189
getting older I'm I'm 42 I know a lot of

1875
01:12:02,989 --> 01:12:06,289
the growers and people that listen this

1876
01:12:04,189 --> 01:12:08,179
show are younger than me I think about I

1877
01:12:06,289 --> 01:12:10,460
think about my time like where do I want

1878
01:12:08,180 --> 01:12:11,390
to be spending my time is it you know

1879
01:12:10,460 --> 01:12:13,340
sitting in front of the computer

1880
01:12:11,390 --> 01:12:15,619
answering emails which is an important

1881
01:12:13,340 --> 01:12:18,800
reality of my job or is it spending time
