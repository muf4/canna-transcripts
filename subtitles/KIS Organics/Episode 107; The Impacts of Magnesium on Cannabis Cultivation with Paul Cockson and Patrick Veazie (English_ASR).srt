research and general Diagnostics was

58
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:10,439
super excited to talk to them about some

59
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,479
of their latest published research on

60
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:14,479
cannabis and hemp now on to the show

61
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:19,219
all right hey guys thanks for coming on

62

you're currently up to and uh then we'll

68
00:02:29,818 --> 00:02:32,780
dive into these papers

69
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,180
uh Paul you want to start us off

70
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,980
sure yeah

71
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:46,199
um I'm Paul coxon um I'm currently a PhD

72
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:48,659
student at University of Kentucky

73
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:51,000
um I got involved pretty early on with

74
00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:53,639
Dr Brian whipker at NC State

75
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,159
um doing hemp research cannabis research

76
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:58,919
um and ever since then it's kind of been

77
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:01,318
a fun Wild Ride of just exploring uh

78
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:04,139
this Avenue and that Avenue but most of

79
00:03:01,318 --> 00:03:06,598
our work uh coming out of there the

80
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:09,238
Patrick myself and Dr Whitaker did was

81
00:03:06,598 --> 00:03:12,899
related to fertility and mineral

82
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:14,878
nutrition of cannabis so but currently

83
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:17,039
I'm at University of Kentucky and we're

84
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:20,098
exploring germination and establishment

85
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:22,439
with some Industrial Hemp so a little

86
00:03:20,098 --> 00:03:24,060
bit more of the Grain and fiber side

87
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:26,878
and you Patrick

88
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:28,620
yeah and I'm Patrick veezy I'm a first

89
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:30,959
year Master's student at NC State

90
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:33,180
working under Dr Brian whipker and

91
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,340
worked under Paul as an undergrad

92
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:37,140
most of my research is focused on

93
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,420
Mineral fertility of different crops

94
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:42,779
including cannabis now moving a little

95
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:45,539
bit more into the substrate realm of CBD

96
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:47,878
hemp and other crops as well awesome

97
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:50,400
well I appreciate you guys coming on the

98
00:03:47,878 --> 00:03:53,399
show and the the main purpose of the

99
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,219
show today was to talk about this paper

100
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:58,379
that you were both authors on that uh

101
00:03:56,219 --> 00:04:00,959
that Patrick did a lot of research on

102
00:03:58,378 --> 00:04:04,318
here it's entitled magnesium's impact on

103
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:06,180
Cannabis sativa is it baox is that the

104
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:08,699
name of the cultivar or how do you

105
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:11,340
pronounce that uh bayox

106
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:13,619
bayox okay and silver haze growth and

107
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,840
cannabinoid production awesome but

108
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:18,358
before we dive into that paper there was

109
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,340
a question I got an email from a

110
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:23,339
listener that I thought was interesting

111
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:25,439
and I kind of wanted to talk to you guys

112
00:04:23,339 --> 00:04:28,500
about it and just kind of expound on

113
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:31,800
that so the the email is sent the the

114
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:34,139
gist of the email was why don't

115
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:37,319
researchers partner with Farmers or

116
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:39,720
Growers that know how to grow plants to

117
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:42,659
get you know really healthy happy plants

118
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:44,460
for these trials and I think this was in

119
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:46,259
relation Paul to one of the papers you

120
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:49,319
did and the plants in the paper not

121
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:50,580
looking quite so hot so can you kind of

122
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:51,240
explain

123
00:04:50,579 --> 00:04:52,740
um

124
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,918
just a little bit more around that

125
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:57,540
process and and yeah just yeah I'll just

126
00:04:55,918 --> 00:04:59,219
leave it with that and take it out take

127
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,840
it away

128
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:02,699
yeah for sure

129
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:05,219
um well first off I'm actually really

130
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:07,800
excited that people are commenting and

131
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:10,740
uh you know challenging and and giving

132
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,060
feedback because it's it's important in

133
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,860
this industry that we're all

134
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:15,180
communicating together and sometimes

135
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,680
that means

136
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:19,019
um asking those hard questions or

137
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:21,478
expressing some uh frustration in

138
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:23,879
constructive ways but um I guess I'll

139
00:05:21,478 --> 00:05:26,339
kind of answer that twofold the first

140
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:28,560
part is um actually the very first paper

141
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:31,500
that we did on the survey with Hunter

142
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,780
Landis we partnered with a local grower

143
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,579
that was where we started with our

144
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:37,559
foundation so

145
00:05:35,579 --> 00:05:40,079
um given that Dr Brian whipper has an

146
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,579
extension appointment we really do value

147
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:44,519
and try and partner with Growers

148
00:05:41,579 --> 00:05:46,740
whenever possible but the challenge

149
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:48,478
sometimes is especially with larger

150
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:51,478
grants you're often required to partner

151
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:53,819
with Growers but this industry at least

152
00:05:51,478 --> 00:05:55,560
on the scientific side is so new and

153
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:57,360
we're still breaking into it that a lot

154
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:00,478
of those Federal funding and larger

155
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,699
grants are just now starting to roll out

156
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:04,620
and so most of us were having to do solo

157
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:06,960
work I'm trying to kind of figure some

158
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,699
stuff out on a smaller scale which

159
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:12,180
sometimes makes it difficult to involve

160
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:14,639
Growers but definitely moving forward um

161
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:17,100
we're all in this together and we only

162
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,720
get better together so uh yeah

163
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,500
definitely Partnerships are the way to

164
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,660
go

165
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,579
because you know we're scientists we're

166
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:25,680
really good at science but sometimes you

167
00:06:23,579 --> 00:06:27,240
know we're still doing it well also I I

168
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,579
want to touch on the fact that the point

169
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:33,060
of research is not just for research

170
00:06:29,579 --> 00:06:36,000
itself but actually to further

171
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:37,620
knowledge for Growers and farmers in the

172
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,939
agricultural sector so that you know we

173
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,500
can grow better plants so we can better

174
00:06:38,939 --> 00:06:42,000
understand that process so you're not

175
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:44,399
doing science in a vacuum but you're

176
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,240
doing it hopefully with the goal of

177
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:47,239
impacting Growers

178
00:06:48,779 --> 00:06:53,818
yeah and that's a really good point um I

179
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,339
always laugh because Brian uh Dr whipker

180
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:58,080
he has a saying um he does a lot of

181
00:06:56,339 --> 00:07:00,538
nutrient deficiency work and he always

182
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:03,060
says his motto is we kill plants so you

183
00:07:00,538 --> 00:07:04,978
don't have to and uh you know I think

184
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:07,680
sometimes you know we as scientists

185
00:07:04,978 --> 00:07:09,240
we're we're almost looking to fail or

186
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,100
we're looking for that failure point

187
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:13,139
because we're trying to fail and figure

188
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:15,600
out you know what's wrong so that we can

189
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:18,538
inform the The Growers in the industry

190
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:20,160
and what not to do and the other thing

191
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:22,439
is just a little bit about the the

192
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,000
scientific process itself

193
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:25,860
um you know when you're designing an

194
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,220
experiment you have a very specific

195
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:31,620
question in mind and so you're kind of

196
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:33,240
streamlining all of your variables and

197
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:35,038
you're trying to eliminate anything that

198
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,978
can impact that question so that you get

199
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:39,779
kind of a pure answer at the end and so

200
00:07:37,978 --> 00:07:42,060
if something goes wrong in the middle of

201
00:07:39,779 --> 00:07:43,739
an experiment sometimes you can't fix it

202
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:45,660
because if you do try and fix it you

203
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:47,579
don't know if maybe what you did to try

204
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:49,919
and fix and auto correct your trajectory

205
00:07:47,579 --> 00:07:52,560
impacted the results or if it was truly

206
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:54,180
your experiment and so you know early on

207
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,699
when we were still kind of trying to

208
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:58,319
dial in with the phosphorus work our

209
00:07:56,699 --> 00:08:00,180
plants didn't look too hot but we knew

210
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,860
that we couldn't correct that because we

211
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:05,400
were very specifically trying to study

212
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:07,199
phosphorus and uh when we came to this

213
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:10,918
next round of experiments that Patrick

214
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:14,280
headed up with the Magnesium work we we

215
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:15,598
definitely changed a few things here and

216
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:18,538
there especially with the fertility

217
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:20,939
regime um then it really showed through

218
00:08:18,538 --> 00:08:22,740
in this experiment that we also learned

219
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:24,839
from our mistakes yes so so once you

220
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:28,139
have your methodology in place here in

221
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:29,519
your hypothesis you really can't make a

222
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:30,660
lot of changes at that point you're kind

223
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:32,960
of committed is that essentially what

224
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,960
you're saying

225
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:36,778
oh and Patrick you had something you

226
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,520
want to add to that

227
00:08:36,778 --> 00:08:41,038
yeah so

228
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:42,899
we did experience some magnesium

229
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:45,299
problems in Paul's study

230
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:46,799
but kind of looking at that we saw the

231
00:08:45,299 --> 00:08:48,120
problem and while we couldn't correct it

232
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:50,059
for that that's kind of what

233
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,799
springboarded us into this next project

234
00:08:50,059 --> 00:08:54,659
is that all of our work kind of built

235
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:57,299
off what we had done and the problems we

236
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:59,100
had seen so even though once we were

237
00:08:57,299 --> 00:09:01,079
committed to only playing around with

238
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,220
the phosphorus rate and that first

239
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:05,040
experiment

240
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:06,899
we adjusted and actually sprung board us

241
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:10,439
into this completely other direction for

242
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:14,399
a new experiment to look at magnesium

243
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:15,660
so while problems do occur early on as

244
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,759
we've gone through this line of

245
00:09:15,659 --> 00:09:19,919
experiments the plans have looked better

246
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:22,620
because we've made these minor changes

247
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:25,319
all the way along and we kind of

248
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:26,639
document that with our research

249
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,379
that makes a lot of sense and I

250
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:29,338
appreciate you guys explaining that and

251
00:09:28,379 --> 00:09:31,559
uh

252
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:33,180
it is great to hear that research is

253
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:35,039
partnering with

254
00:09:33,179 --> 00:09:37,259
Growers and farmers and that's the main

255
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:40,559
purpose of it one other aspect to that

256
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:44,278
though too as as someone who works with

257
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:47,039
a number of cannabis facilities

258
00:09:44,278 --> 00:09:48,720
they're not really set up to do research

259
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:50,699
in a lot of ways because you can't set

260
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,959
up a protocol that you know won't give

261
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:56,820
you the highest economic uh gain so you

262
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:58,079
can't you can't set an experiment where

263
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,459
you know you're going to lose some

264
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,500
plants or your plants are going to yield

265
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:02,639
lower because at the end of the day your

266
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,759
bottom line is what's keeping you in

267
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:08,220
business so that's where you know having

268
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:10,679
another location working with

269
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:12,060
researchers and giving input is really

270
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:13,979
important because you just can't do it

271
00:10:12,059 --> 00:10:16,619
in a working facility

272
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:18,420
so I just want to add that to that but

273
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,860
let's let's just dive into this this

274
00:10:18,419 --> 00:10:20,879
magnesium paper

275
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,740
um

276
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:24,778
Patrick uh do you want to go ahead and

277
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:27,600
just uh explain a little bit of what the

278
00:10:24,778 --> 00:10:29,639
goals of the paper were and you know

279
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:33,720
start taking us through it

280
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:35,819
yeah so this magnesium paper really

281
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,440
started off as a problem that we were

282
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:39,600
seeing with our plants and a lot of

283
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,180
other growers in the southeast

284
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,278
so magnesium

285
00:10:42,179 --> 00:10:47,159
you can get a lot of it from your water

286
00:10:44,278 --> 00:10:48,838
supply if you're on a well where your

287
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:50,699
ground water contains a lot of magnesium

288
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:52,920
this is pretty common in the Upper

289
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:55,259
Midwest where a lot of their parent

290
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:57,539
materials contain the Magnesium so it

291
00:10:55,259 --> 00:10:59,519
winds up in their water however here in

292
00:10:57,539 --> 00:11:00,659
the Southeast especially North and South

293
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,399
Carolina

294
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:03,600
we were seeing a lot of magnesium

295
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,278
problems because our water really

296
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,700
doesn't contain any

297
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:11,700
so like with Paul's research

298
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:14,420
when we're mixing our fertilizers if you

299
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:17,759
use a Triple Tin it doesn't contain

300
00:11:14,419 --> 00:11:20,939
magnesium and sulfur uh

301
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:22,319
so moving along into that we'd we saw a

302
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:25,019
lot of Growers have this magnesium

303
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,160
deficiency going on especially late in

304
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:28,679
the bud set

305
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:30,899
so we wanted to determine if we can find

306
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:32,578
that magnesium fertility rate that

307
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:34,440
Growers can Target

308
00:11:32,578 --> 00:11:36,000
in order to not have that magnesium

309
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,440
deficiency especially later in the

310
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,778
production cycle

311
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,760
so moving along with that we set up this

312
00:11:39,778 --> 00:11:43,980
experiment where we looked at six

313
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:46,980
different magnesium fertility rates

314
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:49,519
of zero

315
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,519
see

316
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:54,480
zero twelve and a half twenty five fifty

317
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:56,219
seventy five and a hundred part per

318
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,500
million magnesium

319
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:00,959
and we held them constant throughout the

320
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,578
entire experiment and we looked at the

321
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:05,219
uptake in the plant growth at three

322
00:12:02,578 --> 00:12:07,019
different stages a vegetative stage

323
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:09,300
pre-flower where we're only a couple

324
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:11,459
weeks in a Bud set and then at the end

325
00:12:09,299 --> 00:12:13,620
of flowering of so 12 weeks of total

326
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:16,799
growth or eight weeks of reproductive

327
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:18,600
and just looked at you know how much

328
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:20,219
magnesium was the plant taking up and

329
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,200
what the impacts on the growth in

330
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:24,120
cannabinoids were

331
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:27,259
so that was kind of the Baseline for the

332
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,259
study and why we did it

333
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:34,679
now you you guys what was your um what

334
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,720
was your media for this because I when I

335
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:40,078
think of magnesium I typically see it

336
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:42,420
coming in a lot with compost

337
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:45,299
um so it's part of my media already in

338
00:12:42,419 --> 00:12:48,360
in many cases I tend to never have to

339
00:12:45,299 --> 00:12:50,039
add magnesium even though it's not in my

340
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:53,459
water just because we get it when we mix

341
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:56,639
soils but if you're growing

342
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:58,319
you know purely using mineral salts I

343
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,180
could see where that could be a little

344
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,740
more challenging what were you guys

345
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:04,679
doing in this case

346
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:08,220
so for this one we utilized the 70 30

347
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:10,919
peat perlite volume to volume substrate

348
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:13,139
so and we custom Blended that so we know

349
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:15,120
it didn't have a pre-plant charge

350
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:17,220
so this rate that we're sort of

351
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,459
recommending as your baseline or

352
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:22,259
Cornerstone to modify from there

353
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:25,138
this is with nothing coming in in the

354
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:26,539
soil as well as everything is supplied

355
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:29,100
through liquid feed

356
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:32,699
so like you're saying a lot of it can

357
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:35,820
come in with your substrate your water

358
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:37,980
or many other things here's just what we

359
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:40,800
were looking to recommend is what should

360
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:43,740
your Cornerstone bead kind of look at to

361
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:45,120
avoid the deficiency and then you know

362
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:47,339
if it is coming in a lot in your

363
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:51,980
substrate or in your water you can kind

364
00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:51,980
of take that away from the rate

365
00:13:52,259 --> 00:13:58,379
so uh and your decision to keep

366
00:13:55,159 --> 00:14:00,000
magnesium the same throughout the cycle

367
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:02,939
in terms of how much you were feeding

368
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:06,379
what went into that

369
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:06,380
sort of sort of that conversation

370
00:14:06,419 --> 00:14:11,278
so looking to keep it constant versus

371
00:14:09,059 --> 00:14:13,859
altering it it's

372
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:15,778
mainly that magnesium's a mobile element

373
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:17,820
so if the plant needs it it'll be able

374
00:14:15,778 --> 00:14:20,519
to translocate it so we wanted to see

375
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:22,620
just by giving a constant feed

376
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:25,620
you know will the plant take it from the

377
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:28,679
lower leaves whatever it's not in

378
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:30,899
reproductive and move it to the new and

379
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:32,819
developing foliage or into the buds when

380
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:34,200
it's developing we didn't really want to

381
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:36,839
alter it we wanted to kind of see if you

382
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:39,480
held it exactly constant throughout how

383
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:41,519
the plants new sinks and sources were

384
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:44,100
really going to influence

385
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,899
how much was needed

386
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:48,420
okay now before we go into the results

387
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:50,220
can you uh could one of you guys give me

388
00:14:48,419 --> 00:14:51,958
a little overview on magnesium I feel

389
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:54,180
like maybe we should we should have

390
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:56,819
backed up and started there uh in terms

391
00:14:54,179 --> 00:15:00,120
of how how it works in the plant and

392
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:01,860
what a deficiency may look like

393
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:04,039
um relative to other nutrients and if

394
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:06,839
there's any antagonistic

395
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:10,639
relationships with other nutrients like

396
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:10,639
the on the motors chart for example

397
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:18,419
so magnesium deficiency which we have a

398
00:15:16,379 --> 00:15:21,419
pretty good photo of

399
00:15:18,419 --> 00:15:23,458
um in the article it initially will

400
00:15:21,419 --> 00:15:25,740
appear on that lower one third of the

401
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:28,799
plant the oldest leaves

402
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:33,240
and then it'll start as this intervenal

403
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:34,620
fold uh intervenal chlorosis and it

404
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,360
starts right in the center of the leaf

405
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:40,560
and kind of spreads outward to the edge

406
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:42,600
of the leaflet and then as the uh

407
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:44,219
deficiency becomes more severe it

408
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,680
spreads into that middle portion of the

409
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:48,600
plant and then we saw in many severe

410
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:49,638
cases it can be throughout the entire

411
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:52,920
plant

412
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:55,139
now once that intravenal chlorosis has

413
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:57,179
really developed we begin to start to

414
00:15:55,139 --> 00:15:59,519
see necrosis forming and then leaves

415
00:15:57,179 --> 00:16:03,059
dying and falling from the plant

416
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:05,879
so it is also Mobile in the plant

417
00:16:03,059 --> 00:16:07,679
so once it starts in that lower one

418
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:10,019
third of the plant the plant's actually

419
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:12,419
taking the new the Magnesium that was in

420
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:13,980
those lower leaves and translocating it

421
00:16:12,419 --> 00:16:15,539
to the upper portions of the plant to

422
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:18,000
meet the new developing needs of the

423
00:16:15,539 --> 00:16:20,578
plant so especially when we put that

424
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,078
plant to flower and reproductive it's

425
00:16:20,578 --> 00:16:23,638
going to take all those nutrients that

426
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:25,379
is stored in the bottom it's going to

427
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:28,560
shift them up to the buds

428
00:16:25,379 --> 00:16:30,240
so it's kind of essentially a magnesium

429
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:31,259
piggy bank in that lower one-third of

430
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,579
the plant where it's going to kind of

431
00:16:31,259 --> 00:16:34,319
hold it

432
00:16:32,578 --> 00:16:35,638
and then once it's needed for that bud

433
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,959
production it's going to move it to the

434
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:38,759
upper portion

435
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:41,338
and that's kind of one thing we wanted

436
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:43,500
to look at is how much is needed to not

437
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:45,959
see that translocation

438
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:49,559
and keep it constant throughout

439
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:51,239
but just because your lower leaves are

440
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:52,799
efficient that doesn't mean your upper

441
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:54,600
leaves are deficient because it's moving

442
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:57,838
it throughout so that's why it will

443
00:16:54,600 --> 00:17:00,320
initially appear first in the lower area

444
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:03,600
and then in terms of antagon

445
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:07,220
antagonistic effects with other elements

446
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:10,199
magnesium is antagonized by

447
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:13,679
potassium and calcium

448
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:16,860
however it's synergistic or we see an

449
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:18,660
increase in uptake when phosphorus is

450
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:23,279
high or nitrogen

451
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:25,740
so uh really looking at your nnp to see

452
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:28,078
if we really increase that nitrogen rate

453
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:30,058
or really increase that phosphorus rate

454
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:32,339
you will see an increase in that

455
00:17:30,058 --> 00:17:35,279
magnesium uptake

456
00:17:32,339 --> 00:17:39,538
um so for what we looked at here

457
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:43,678
we had 150 Park million in uh constant

458
00:17:39,538 --> 00:17:46,679
feed so if we did increase this uh to

459
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:49,019
you know 250 300 Park million in but

460
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:50,519
like we have seen some Growers do you

461
00:17:49,019 --> 00:17:52,980
may need to alter the rate that we do

462
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:55,079
provide uh because when you increase

463
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:58,940
those two elements you're going to see

464
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:58,939
an increase in magnesium uptake as well

465
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:08,099
yeah and I'll just jump in here real

466
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:10,019
quick and and provide a few comments so

467
00:18:08,099 --> 00:18:11,939
um the the figures that we have in this

468
00:18:10,019 --> 00:18:15,298
paper that Patrick were referring to

469
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:17,820
that's figure three and figure four for

470
00:18:15,298 --> 00:18:20,700
kind of the initial deficiency stages

471
00:18:17,819 --> 00:18:23,099
for magnesium and then kind of the

472
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:24,660
advanced with figure four and another

473
00:18:23,099 --> 00:18:27,418
figure I'd like to highlight is sticker

474
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:29,340
six where we're looking at 25 per

475
00:18:27,419 --> 00:18:31,440
million magnesium

476
00:18:29,339 --> 00:18:34,079
um so it's a composite photo with both

477
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:37,440
nayox and severe Haze showing kind of

478
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:40,139
that uh the Tran reallocation

479
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,820
that Patrick was just talking about and

480
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:43,740
essentially it's pulling it out of those

481
00:18:41,819 --> 00:18:45,839
older leaves and funnily and into the

482
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:48,839
new reproductive I think

483
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:52,079
um but uh as Patrick said

484
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:53,639
um phosphorus magnesium is synergistic

485
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:55,699
with phosphorus and if you actually look

486
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:58,980
at the fertility rates that we utilize

487
00:18:55,700 --> 00:19:00,538
we had 30 parts per million phosphorus

488
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:02,819
and if you'll kind of cast your mind

489
00:19:00,538 --> 00:19:04,140
back to the the previous episode that we

490
00:19:02,819 --> 00:19:05,700
had where you know we were kind of

491
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:09,780
recommending you know start at around

492
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:11,960
the 15 parts per million rate given we

493
00:19:09,779 --> 00:19:14,700
were going so high with the magnesium

494
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:17,220
and given that initially on the

495
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:19,019
phosphorus study we saw some magnesium

496
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:21,000
deficiency that's kind of what sparked

497
00:19:19,019 --> 00:19:22,740
the the interest that Patrick had in the

498
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,839
study so we increased that phosphorus

499
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:26,519
because of the synergism with the

500
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:29,699
Magnesium knowing that we would probably

501
00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:31,859
have an effect there but as far as the

502
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:33,660
importance of magnesium

503
00:19:31,859 --> 00:19:36,178
um in plants so in the chlorophyll

504
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:38,400
molecule it kind of uh sits in in the

505
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:39,840
middle of this ring and it's important

506
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,759
in a chlorophyll production and

507
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:44,939
chlorophyll health so it's directly

508
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:46,980
correlated to photosynthetic health and

509
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:49,140
we all know that you know the healthier

510
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:51,120
the photosynthetic Machinery the more

511
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:53,820
photosynthes and the healthier your

512
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:56,519
plant will be and the more resources it

513
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:58,399
will have to funnel into those buds or

514
00:19:56,519 --> 00:20:01,139
those you know seeds

515
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:03,720
come the induction of the critical photo

516
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:05,360
period so magnesium is definitely

517
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,579
extremely important

518
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:10,199
element

519
00:20:07,579 --> 00:20:12,359
given its its role in photosynthesis

520
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:15,840
that's that's great I really appreciate

521
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:18,899
you guys explaining that can we dive in

522
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:21,119
now to sort of what your your findings

523
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:25,160
were on this and I'll I'll link to this

524
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:28,079
paper and these these diagrams

525
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:29,940
or figures on the on the podcast page

526
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:32,579
itself so people can go back and look at

527
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:37,019
these as well

528
00:20:32,579 --> 00:20:39,298
yeah so our findings uh

529
00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:41,339
for this study was

530
00:20:39,298 --> 00:20:42,900
we noticed that

531
00:20:41,339 --> 00:20:47,459
it was slightly different for both

532
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:49,200
cultivars so uh first

533
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:52,740
bayox

534
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:55,080
we didn't see some of the magnesium

535
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:58,558
deficiency at some of the same rates

536
00:20:55,079 --> 00:21:02,359
that we did for savier haze

537
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:06,779
so we actually saw more of an impact on

538
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:10,379
savior Haze plants compared to bayox

539
00:21:06,779 --> 00:21:12,960
when we had that low magnesium fertility

540
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:15,240
uh savier Haze is a bit more of a bushy

541
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,558
grower and a lot more aggressive grower

542
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,660
than baox

543
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:20,700
so what we did notice is that there's a

544
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:22,919
big colesfar dependency here

545
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:26,038
so when we we're going to make this

546
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:27,480
right recommendation of 50 to 75 part

547
00:21:26,038 --> 00:21:29,640
per million mg

548
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:31,740
however one of our big things that we do

549
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:34,320
want to highlight is a takeaway

550
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:37,620
is that this can kind of serve as a

551
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:38,879
Cornerstone for a grower however it is

552
00:21:37,619 --> 00:21:42,359
not

553
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:45,120
exactly the recipe for a grower so while

554
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:47,038
we can say it's in this range one of the

555
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:48,899
big things I do want to highlight before

556
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:51,179
getting too deep into this

557
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:53,220
is that this will vary based on what

558
00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:55,200
Coles fire you're looking at if you have

559
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:57,659
a very aggressive grower you may need to

560
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:01,259
look at a slightly higher rate compared

561
00:21:57,659 --> 00:22:02,640
to a smaller plant or if you're keeping

562
00:22:01,259 --> 00:22:06,058
them smaller

563
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:08,940
and additionally

564
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:11,339
um magnesium had a negative impact on

565
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:13,919
plant growth at the lowest two rates of

566
00:22:11,339 --> 00:22:16,079
zero and twelve and a half per million

567
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,700
and that's when we're seeing the plant

568
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:20,298
being deficient

569
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:23,159
in the Magnesium uptake

570
00:22:20,298 --> 00:22:26,639
in terms of once we start to move up the

571
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:28,919
ladder 25 to 50. it was also very

572
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:32,159
dependent upon what stage and growth we

573
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:35,900
were at at four weeks of growth

574
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:38,820
25 and 50 for baox were fairly similar

575
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:40,400
however as we begin to move

576
00:22:38,819 --> 00:22:43,980
into

577
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:46,500
the later weeks we begin to see that

578
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:49,380
difference grow much more in terms of

579
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:51,058
overall plant growth metrics so later

580
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:53,520
into the production cycle and that plant

581
00:22:51,058 --> 00:22:56,359
needed more magnesium it really turned

582
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:59,700
into 50 to 75 produced

583
00:22:56,359 --> 00:23:01,918
better growing plants and more yield

584
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:04,620
another thing to really highlight is

585
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:07,919
that we looked at this range of rates of

586
00:23:04,619 --> 00:23:09,658
six of them now at the lower rates of 0

587
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:12,960
to 12 and a half

588
00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:15,419
we completely expected to see a decrease

589
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,279
in plant growth but one of the other

590
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:18,900
things I want to highlight is when we go

591
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:21,418
to the far end of things

592
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:22,919
so if you supply a plant with too many

593
00:23:21,419 --> 00:23:25,080
nutrients

594
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:28,140
you will actually decrease your plant's

595
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:31,379
growth and here we really saw that for

596
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:34,440
both cultivars starting even initially

597
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:36,539
at eight weeks of plant growth for bayox

598
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:38,038
plants that received a hundred par per

599
00:23:36,538 --> 00:23:40,379
million phosphorus

600
00:23:38,038 --> 00:23:43,079
showed significantly less growth

601
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:46,620
compared to those that received 50 to 75

602
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:50,819
and we saw the same yield as plants that

603
00:23:46,619 --> 00:23:54,418
received Zero part per million magnesium

604
00:23:50,819 --> 00:23:56,158
so it's really finding that key balance

605
00:23:54,419 --> 00:23:58,500
for a grower you don't want to over

606
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,820
Supply your plants with magnesium but

607
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,900
you definitely don't want to undersupply

608
00:23:59,819 --> 00:24:02,519
them as well

609
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:04,798
so that's kind of where we get these

610
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:08,519
rates as the Cornerstone of 50 to 75

611
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:09,859
part million mg

612
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:12,298
and really

613
00:24:09,859 --> 00:24:12,839
looking at

614
00:24:12,298 --> 00:24:15,658
um

615
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:18,240
the finals growth stage

616
00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:21,120
we saw that there wasn't a real big

617
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:23,279
difference in budweight overall

618
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:25,678
so it's

619
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:28,558
um for bayox there was no differences at

620
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:31,019
all and when we look at magnesium plants

621
00:24:28,558 --> 00:24:33,480
that received zero or a hundred parts

622
00:24:31,019 --> 00:24:35,579
per million mg exhibited significantly

623
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:37,259
less Bud weight overall

624
00:24:35,579 --> 00:24:39,599
compared to plants that were in that 50

625
00:24:37,259 --> 00:24:41,879
to 75 Park billion mg

626
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:44,519
so your magnesium rate can directly

627
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:48,960
impact your yield and even if you're not

628
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:52,740
seeing magnesium deficiency

629
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:55,620
we you will see a decrease in Bud

630
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:58,558
production because of a over

631
00:24:55,619 --> 00:25:00,658
accumulation of magnesium in your plant

632
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:01,980
so that's kind of the really big things

633
00:25:00,659 --> 00:25:05,100
we want to highlight from the plant

634
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:08,339
growth perspective now one of the main

635
00:25:05,099 --> 00:25:10,158
ways that a grower can determine uh

636
00:25:08,339 --> 00:25:12,240
magnesium

637
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,400
concentration in a plant is through Leaf

638
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:18,240
tissue analysis

639
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:21,419
and one of the things we saw is that

640
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:23,759
as you begin to give the plant more and

641
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:26,460
more magnesium it's definitely going to

642
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:28,019
take that magnesium up looking at all of

643
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:29,759
the different nutrient analysis that we

644
00:25:28,019 --> 00:25:33,119
did on both cultivars

645
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:35,519
and both cultivars uptook magnesium in a

646
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:37,079
linear fashion so the more you gave it

647
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:40,079
the more it took up

648
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:42,658
now granted we also saw that decrease in

649
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:44,819
Bud production so kind of one of the key

650
00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:48,799
things to highlight is that a greater

651
00:25:44,819 --> 00:25:51,960
magnesium concentration does not mean

652
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:53,839
better healthier plants we're kind of

653
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:59,700
looking at a sweet spot here of about

654
00:25:53,839 --> 00:26:00,899
1.15 to 1.3 or a percent magnesium in

655
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:05,278
the leaves

656
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:07,320
uh was kind of that 50 to 75 part per

657
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:08,579
million what it turns into concentration

658
00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:11,399
in the plant

659
00:26:08,579 --> 00:26:13,798
so we didn't see an actual plateau

660
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:16,980
that linear increase continued all the

661
00:26:13,798 --> 00:26:19,759
way up to 100 PPM and G and maybe if we

662
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:23,579
increase the rate further you know to

663
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:26,400
150 200 par per million magnesium

664
00:26:23,579 --> 00:26:28,619
we may see an actual Plateau occur where

665
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:32,820
the plant just won't take any more up

666
00:26:28,619 --> 00:26:35,278
however up to 100 PPM and G which is not

667
00:26:32,819 --> 00:26:37,558
hard to obtain we did see an overall

668
00:26:35,278 --> 00:26:40,619
Plateau or we did not see a plateau and

669
00:26:37,558 --> 00:26:43,619
uptake but we see a plateau in growth so

670
00:26:40,619 --> 00:26:46,019
looking at those uh if you do conduct

671
00:26:43,619 --> 00:26:48,178
nutrient analysis making sure you look

672
00:26:46,019 --> 00:26:50,639
at those values and understand that more

673
00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:53,778
is not better is a key thing to kind of

674
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,778
take away from this piece of work

675
00:26:56,839 --> 00:27:03,000
if I can add something real quick to

676
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:05,640
that um just one click clarification for

677
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:08,220
bayox regardless of the Magnesium

678
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:11,159
concentration we didn't see much

679
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:13,980
differences in the bud weight but for

680
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:16,140
severe Haze we did and those differences

681
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:19,038
were seen at the 50 parts per million

682
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:21,778
rate compared to the zero

683
00:27:19,038 --> 00:27:24,240
but then once we got up to those higher

684
00:27:21,778 --> 00:27:26,839
concentrations like Patrick said we did

685
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:29,278
see a decrease in that total Bud weight

686
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:33,058
so again just kind of

687
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:36,179
to kind of I guess uh parrot something

688
00:27:33,058 --> 00:27:38,278
that Patrick said earlier it really when

689
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:39,659
when looking at this research and trying

690
00:27:38,278 --> 00:27:41,460
to figure out what what does this mean

691
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:42,299
for my operation what does this mean for

692
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:45,000
me

693
00:27:42,298 --> 00:27:47,158
um recognizing that there will be Cult

694
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,259
of Articles of our variety or variety

695
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:51,900
differences that you're seeing and so

696
00:27:49,259 --> 00:27:54,179
using this as kind of a starting point

697
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:56,519
and a guideline to conduct your own

698
00:27:54,179 --> 00:27:58,640
research in your own facility because a

699
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:01,500
lot of you know other abiotic factors

700
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:04,200
what type of Lights you're using how

701
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:06,359
often you're irrigating your vapor

702
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,798
pressure deficit will impact you know

703
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:09,979
how those plants are taking up and

704
00:28:07,798 --> 00:28:13,940
utilizing the nutrients as well

705
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:16,500
so just wanted to you know

706
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:19,440
reiterate what Patrick is yeah just so I

707
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:21,839
understand it too you said that with

708
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,159
bayox you didn't see a difference in Bud

709
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:24,839
weight but then when you got to the

710
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:27,360
higher

711
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:30,359
higher concentrations you did

712
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:32,939
so did you or did you not see difference

713
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:35,038
in overall yield I guess or are you

714
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:37,558
talking about the actual buds size and

715
00:28:35,038 --> 00:28:41,599
weight just comparing a like a single

716
00:28:37,558 --> 00:28:41,599
bud but that was my confusion in that

717
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,220
yeah yeah so um if you look at table 10

718
00:28:45,659 --> 00:28:48,960
and table 11

719
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:50,460
um from the paper you can see that total

720
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,659
Bud weight

721
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:54,298
um there

722
00:28:51,659 --> 00:28:55,799
um so we took a sub sample composite if

723
00:28:54,298 --> 00:28:58,379
that's if I'm remembering correctly

724
00:28:55,798 --> 00:29:01,679
Patrick or did you uh this is

725
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:05,100
all of the buds on the plant and looking

726
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:07,440
at uh table tin which is bayox

727
00:29:05,099 --> 00:29:09,298
for any of the examined magnesium

728
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,720
fertility rates we don't see a

729
00:29:09,298 --> 00:29:16,379
difference however savior Haze

730
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:19,500
we do see a difference between that 50

731
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:22,559
or we see a decrease in total Bud weight

732
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:25,980
produced by those that were zero uh part

733
00:29:22,558 --> 00:29:27,599
per million mg and 50 and then we also

734
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:29,940
see a decrease on the other end of the

735
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:32,099
spectrum so plants that received 100

736
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:34,798
part per million mg produced

737
00:29:32,099 --> 00:29:37,259
significantly less total Bud weight

738
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:38,099
compared to those that receive 50.

739
00:29:37,259 --> 00:29:41,398
um

740
00:29:38,099 --> 00:29:43,939
so that really ties in that cultivar

741
00:29:41,398 --> 00:29:45,959
difference between

742
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:48,720
cultivars will react differently

743
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:51,360
different differently based upon the

744
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:54,298
Magnesium fertility rate so in some you

745
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:58,699
may see a significant decrease in but

746
00:29:54,298 --> 00:29:58,700
production in others you may not

747
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:05,460
so

748
00:30:01,798 --> 00:30:08,940
to kind of summarize Tad in one cultivar

749
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:11,340
we saw no differences regardless of

750
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:13,558
which magnesium rate we're seeing in

751
00:30:11,339 --> 00:30:15,959
total budweight so no correlation

752
00:30:13,558 --> 00:30:18,119
between Bud weight and magnesium however

753
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:20,759
in the other cultivar we saw that we had

754
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:23,219
lower Bud weights at those lower

755
00:30:20,759 --> 00:30:26,700
concentrations and it increased up to

756
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:28,980
that 50 parts per million magnesium and

757
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:32,159
then it then decreased when we got to

758
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:33,778
that 100 to be less okay so as the big

759
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:35,700
takeaway is that genetics can play a

760
00:30:33,778 --> 00:30:38,759
huge role in magnesium uptake because we

761
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:41,278
have such diversity in genetics and

762
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:41,879
and what people are growing perfect

763
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:45,298
um

764
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:48,480
some of the other I guess big points

765
00:30:45,298 --> 00:30:50,639
that you would you would highlight

766
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,740
um are

767
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,500
uh sorry I have to go back now and

768
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:55,859
recollect my thoughts um

769
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:57,058
[Music]

770
00:30:55,859 --> 00:30:58,740
actually I'm going to come back to that

771
00:30:57,058 --> 00:31:00,538
so the first the thing I want to touch

772
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:03,179
on was lighting because you mentioned

773
00:31:00,538 --> 00:31:04,859
lighting um

774
00:31:03,179 --> 00:31:06,778
you were growing in a greenhouse in this

775
00:31:04,859 --> 00:31:09,479
case right and you mentioned magnesium's

776
00:31:06,778 --> 00:31:13,679
role in photosynthetic um

777
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:15,659
activity do you think if you had pushed

778
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:18,179
uh your

779
00:31:15,659 --> 00:31:21,059
your you know your pdfd levels higher or

780
00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:23,940
more consistently across like like say

781
00:31:21,058 --> 00:31:25,639
with an indoor indoor facility you know

782
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:29,220
it

783
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:31,440
1200 ppfd or somewhere around there you

784
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:32,700
would have seen increased magnesium well

785
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,558
I guess you you couldn't see increased

786
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:35,880
magnesium uptake do you think you would

787
00:31:34,558 --> 00:31:36,599
have seen

788
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,220
um

789
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:41,219
you know deficiencies or maybe have

790
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:42,058
needed more magnesium

791
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:44,519
um

792
00:31:42,058 --> 00:31:49,038
in those instances relative to what you

793
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:49,038
actually saw in in this study

794
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:57,360
I think by pushing the plant by

795
00:31:54,898 --> 00:32:00,178
increasing you know ppfd

796
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:04,619
to once you're pushing that plant to get

797
00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:06,899
bigger faster comparatively to uh we

798
00:32:04,619 --> 00:32:10,619
were growing with natural DLI with night

799
00:32:06,898 --> 00:32:13,379
Interruption and this started off in

800
00:32:10,619 --> 00:32:17,398
uh early spring and transitioned into

801
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:19,860
later in the spring closer to mid-april

802
00:32:17,398 --> 00:32:23,099
so we weren't in you know what we'd

803
00:32:19,859 --> 00:32:23,939
consider the maximum ppfd or DLI for the

804
00:32:23,099 --> 00:32:26,699
year

805
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:28,320
so by adding more lights and other

806
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:30,960
things and you're really pushing that

807
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:34,200
plant pushing the photosynthesis

808
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:36,620
increasing mass flow of other nutrients

809
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:39,000
I think you would have needed a slightly

810
00:32:36,619 --> 00:32:40,500
increased magnesium fertility rate to

811
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,079
help compensate for that plant growth

812
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:45,659
that you're really pushing

813
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:48,538
um additionally when you're really

814
00:32:45,659 --> 00:32:50,039
if you're increasing the photosynthesis

815
00:32:48,538 --> 00:32:51,778
and transpiration and everything else

816
00:32:50,038 --> 00:32:54,538
magnesium is going to get drawn up more

817
00:32:51,778 --> 00:32:56,700
because the plant's utilizing more water

818
00:32:54,538 --> 00:32:59,099
so you could potentially need to

819
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:01,679
increase uh your magnesium fertility

820
00:32:59,099 --> 00:33:03,319
rate as well to compensate for that

821
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:07,380
increase in plant growth

822
00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:09,240
or vice versa if you're going to try and

823
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:11,820
slow the plants down

824
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:15,179
and not need to irrigate nearly as much

825
00:33:11,819 --> 00:33:15,178
between intervals

826
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:19,860
then you could potentially lower this

827
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:21,240
magnesium fertility rate as well but

828
00:33:19,859 --> 00:33:24,139
definitely lighting if you're going to

829
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:26,640
push the plants potentially looking at

830
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:28,679
tinkering with this Cornerstone that

831
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:31,820
we're kind of providing you may need to

832
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:35,538
up increase it depending upon

833
00:33:31,819 --> 00:33:35,538
your setup as well

834
00:33:35,579 --> 00:33:39,359
great and did you see

835
00:33:38,579 --> 00:33:43,619
um

836
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:46,019
did you see diff can't calcium or

837
00:33:43,619 --> 00:33:50,459
potassium deficiencies as you increase

838
00:33:46,019 --> 00:33:52,259
magnesium up to that 100 PPM level on

839
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:54,620
visually with the plant or with tissue

840
00:33:52,259 --> 00:33:54,619
analysis

841
00:33:55,140 --> 00:34:01,200
um neither visually nor uh so Paul did

842
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:03,419
the original Cornerstone that y'all

843
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,759
highlighted of nutrient values for

844
00:34:03,419 --> 00:34:09,720
cannabis deficiencies

845
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:13,260
and we were only playing around with

846
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:14,819
um about 100 Park million mg so we

847
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:18,179
really didn't see that much of a

848
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:21,240
difference compared to our 150 Park

849
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:23,099
million in modified Covenant solution I

850
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:27,239
think if we really would have started to

851
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:28,859
increase the Magnesium you know 150 200

852
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:31,500
we could have started to see a little

853
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:33,960
bit more of that interaction

854
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:37,739
um you do slightly see some of that

855
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:40,440
interaction playing out in savier Haze

856
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:41,638
but we don't see nearly two deficient

857
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,440
levels

858
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:45,059
um but there is just a little bit of

859
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:48,000
that interaction occurring where you see

860
00:34:45,059 --> 00:34:51,000
as we go up in magnesium you see

861
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,378
slightly lower calcium levels in some of

862
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,440
them

863
00:34:52,378 --> 00:34:58,019
okay okay so uh the high level things

864
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:59,639
just getting back to that are that it's

865
00:34:58,019 --> 00:35:02,400
really important to have sufficiency in

866
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:04,559
magnesium but it's uh you can't you

867
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:07,039
can't have a luxury amount that has

868
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:09,960
antagonistic effects so there is a limit

869
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:12,659
to how much magnesium you want in your

870
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:15,659
media or being uptaken by the plants

871
00:35:12,659 --> 00:35:17,399
it's going to be affected by all your

872
00:35:15,659 --> 00:35:19,259
abiotic conditions your environments

873
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:20,760
watering habits

874
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:21,900
all of those things it's a mobile

875
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:23,520
nutrient

876
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:25,619
and

877
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:26,820
um genetics plays a big role are there

878
00:35:25,619 --> 00:35:27,720
any other high-level things that I

879
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:30,359
missed

880
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:32,578
and kind of recapping some of this in 50

881
00:35:30,358 --> 00:35:35,699
to 75 PPM was The Sweet Spot in the

882
00:35:32,579 --> 00:35:38,240
study for these genetics uh based off

883
00:35:35,699 --> 00:35:38,239
what you saw

884
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:41,820
uh yeah

885
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:43,500
um that's all correct the other high

886
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:45,359
level thing that

887
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:48,719
we kind of wanted to point out is we

888
00:35:45,358 --> 00:35:50,940
didn't see a any influence on

889
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:52,919
cannabinoids

890
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:55,858
um so

891
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:57,900
from our current understanding is

892
00:35:55,858 --> 00:35:59,279
at these levels we weren't seeing that

893
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:01,440
interaction with the cannabinoid

894
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,960
production pathway

895
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:06,358
um now potentially if you

896
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:08,639
are running a different system or or

897
00:36:06,358 --> 00:36:11,299
running different genetics as well you

898
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:13,559
may start to see a difference

899
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:15,720
however we did not see a difference

900
00:36:13,559 --> 00:36:18,019
based upon the Magnesium rate for our

901
00:36:15,719 --> 00:36:19,858
setup

902
00:36:18,019 --> 00:36:21,420
now as

903
00:36:19,858 --> 00:36:25,559
go ahead Paul

904
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:27,960
oh How can I jump in here

905
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:30,358
um so if you look at tables 14 and 15

906
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:33,358
from the paper it kind of highlights

907
00:36:30,358 --> 00:36:35,519
what Patrick was saying here and what we

908
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:37,739
essentially did is we kind of reiterated

909
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:39,780
this point that genetics plays a huge

910
00:36:37,739 --> 00:36:41,639
part because you can see that you know

911
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:43,880
while magnesium didn't necessarily

912
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:47,400
impact the cannabinoids

913
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:50,160
and we did have quite Stark differences

914
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:52,460
between the two cultivars and the type

915
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:55,139
of cannabinoids that they were producing

916
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:57,838
across the acidic pools as well as the

917
00:36:55,139 --> 00:36:59,639
decarboxylated pools so again just kind

918
00:36:57,838 --> 00:37:02,279
of driving home the point that you know

919
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:04,319
this is a starting point and based on

920
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:05,519
your genetics and your environment you

921
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,079
know you can kind of use this as a

922
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:08,940
guiding star but you'll have to make

923
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:11,160
some fine tune adjustments and find out

924
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:14,220
what works for you and your operation so

925
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:15,719
yeah so as someone who works with what

926
00:37:14,219 --> 00:37:18,059
people are calling living soil these

927
00:37:15,719 --> 00:37:21,199
days which so essentially soilless media

928
00:37:18,059 --> 00:37:23,420
with compost organic

929
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:27,118
inputs

930
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:28,680
where the nutrients or fertilizer that

931
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:31,140
we're adding is not immediately

932
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:32,879
available to the plant like like it is

933
00:37:31,139 --> 00:37:36,000
in in the

934
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:38,160
in in this study that you're running I

935
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,239
tend to aim for lower levels of

936
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:43,259
magnesium

937
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:45,419
on my soil tests because I know that it

938
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:48,900
can tighten the soil

939
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:51,260
it raises your pH pretty dramatically

940
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,838
relative to other cations and

941
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,380
[Music]

942
00:37:51,838 --> 00:37:55,320
um

943
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:57,960
it's harder to flesh out relative to

944
00:37:55,320 --> 00:38:00,240
some of the other cations so for me I

945
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:02,820
aim low and then

946
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:06,059
um as an organic grower I use magnesium

947
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:09,059
sulfate Epsom salt as a way of of sort

948
00:38:06,059 --> 00:38:12,179
of feeding magnesium as needed but

949
00:38:09,059 --> 00:38:14,519
typically I'll wait until I get a you

950
00:38:12,179 --> 00:38:17,399
know some sort of visual

951
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:19,199
clue of a deficiency but one thing that

952
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:21,599
your research is showing and correct me

953
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:24,960
on anything I've said so far if if I if

954
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:28,200
I misspeak in your eyes um

955
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:29,820
you're saying that potentially just by

956
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:32,098
waiting for that visual deficiency on

957
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:34,859
magnesium I may be

958
00:38:32,099 --> 00:38:35,880
possibly impacting overall plant health

959
00:38:34,858 --> 00:38:38,900
or yield

960
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,900
is that is that correct

961
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:43,260
because you found differences based off

962
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:45,059
of

963
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:46,619
um doing your Leaf tissue analysis that

964
00:38:45,059 --> 00:38:49,679
showed

965
00:38:46,619 --> 00:38:53,460
essentially a decrease in yield

966
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:55,019
um prior to visual plant deficiency is

967
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:58,019
that

968
00:38:55,019 --> 00:38:59,639
is that a Pharisee

969
00:38:58,019 --> 00:39:00,300
yes

970
00:38:59,639 --> 00:39:02,400
um

971
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:06,560
all that you're saying with

972
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:10,019
in a living soil system magnesium

973
00:39:06,559 --> 00:39:13,679
can be very problematic both with ph

974
00:39:10,019 --> 00:39:14,940
locking up the soil and everything else

975
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:16,199
um

976
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:19,220
but

977
00:39:16,199 --> 00:39:21,960
you're also kind of holding it there

978
00:39:19,219 --> 00:39:24,239
to kind of it's already incorporated

979
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:26,880
into your soil

980
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:28,338
um from what we're kind of viewing is we

981
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:31,440
did see

982
00:39:28,338 --> 00:39:33,179
decreases when we didn't add any

983
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:36,059
supplement because we did a constant

984
00:39:33,179 --> 00:39:38,578
feed so

985
00:39:36,059 --> 00:39:40,980
I can't answer that if

986
00:39:38,579 --> 00:39:44,579
you're making an adjustment as you see a

987
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:46,740
visual deficiency if you're negating the

988
00:39:44,579 --> 00:39:48,060
deficiency with your supplement of Epsom

989
00:39:46,739 --> 00:39:49,259
salt

990
00:39:48,059 --> 00:39:51,179
um

991
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:52,920
we're kind of only saying that if you

992
00:39:51,179 --> 00:39:54,358
see the efficiency and you don't

993
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:57,480
supplement

994
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:59,880
uh you will see a decrease for the two

995
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:02,699
cultivars we looked at but we can't

996
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:04,858
necessarily make a statement if if you

997
00:40:02,699 --> 00:40:05,939
see the deficiency and you make an

998
00:40:04,858 --> 00:40:09,119
adjustment

999
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:11,338
the lease will still look deficient but

1000
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:13,619
that new growth is likely going to take

1001
00:40:11,338 --> 00:40:15,239
it up so I assume you're negating it to

1002
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:17,940
a certain point but I can't necessarily

1003
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:21,059
say that you are going to see that

1004
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:23,880
deficiency if you add later because it's

1005
00:40:21,059 --> 00:40:27,000
a mobile nutrient those lower leaves are

1006
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:29,760
potentially nutrient sinks at that point

1007
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,460
um especially in an indoor facility

1008
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,480
where they're getting a lot less light

1009
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:36,019
so you're saying it may not be as

1010
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:36,019
impactful

1011
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:41,460
yeah the the plant's not gonna go back

1012
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,679
and prioritize those lower leaves uh

1013
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:45,358
it's even if you add Epsom salts those

1014
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:47,699
leaves will still look deficient and

1015
00:40:45,358 --> 00:40:50,159
show the deficiency symptoms but the

1016
00:40:47,699 --> 00:40:52,679
additional magnesium sulfate you applied

1017
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:56,039
will be prioritized to your new growth

1018
00:40:52,679 --> 00:40:58,500
which would be your uh your bud or your

1019
00:40:56,039 --> 00:41:02,300
new developing shoe tip which is your

1020
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:02,300
economic portion of the plant

1021
00:41:02,519 --> 00:41:08,280
go ahead Paul

1022
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:11,338
and oh oh I'll jump in real quick if I

1023
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:13,800
can here and kind of highlight something

1024
00:41:11,338 --> 00:41:15,779
um that this paper shows

1025
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:17,760
um and and kind of going back to the

1026
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:20,339
figure that I referenced before where we

1027
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:22,619
had the two mature plants I had 25 parts

1028
00:41:20,338 --> 00:41:24,299
per million magnesium that we're showing

1029
00:41:22,619 --> 00:41:26,220
those deficiencies I think it's

1030
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:27,900
important when you see a nutrient

1031
00:41:26,219 --> 00:41:29,759
deficiency a lot of times you tend to

1032
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:31,200
freak out you know it's like oh no

1033
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,780
something doesn't look right my plant

1034
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:36,480
isn't totally beautiful and you know it

1035
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:38,280
doesn't look right well understanding

1036
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,500
the life cycle of the plant and when

1037
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:42,540
that deficiency may start naturally

1038
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:44,880
occurring because of that reallocation

1039
00:41:42,539 --> 00:41:47,159
can also kind of help you because you

1040
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:49,320
know if you're within the sweet spot for

1041
00:41:47,159 --> 00:41:52,078
your operation you've done your research

1042
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:53,940
and you've looked at your 50 parts per

1043
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:55,619
million but you know that with your

1044
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:58,320
genetics and your setup you're gonna see

1045
00:41:55,619 --> 00:42:01,559
some magnesium deficiency about four

1046
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:04,320
weeks in to um you know bud set

1047
00:42:01,559 --> 00:42:06,059
it may be okay because that plant is

1048
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:08,099
just reallocating and so if you're

1049
00:42:06,059 --> 00:42:09,900
trying to correct that at that point you

1050
00:42:08,099 --> 00:42:11,460
may be throwing money away because if

1051
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:13,139
you know that the final product you're

1052
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:15,659
getting even though you're seeing that

1053
00:42:13,139 --> 00:42:18,480
magnesium deficiency in those leaves

1054
00:42:15,659 --> 00:42:20,940
because it's relocating you don't want

1055
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,920
to put more money into the system

1056
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:25,679
when you know that your cannabinoids and

1057
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:28,380
your bud is still going to be good at

1058
00:42:25,679 --> 00:42:30,000
the end of the season there for you so

1059
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:33,000
you know it's kind of like the the

1060
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,980
classic you're driving by a cornfield in

1061
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,139
the fall and plants look like crap

1062
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:39,179
because they're dying and finessing but

1063
00:42:37,139 --> 00:42:40,920
that's actually a good thing because the

1064
00:42:39,179 --> 00:42:43,618
plant has taken up all these resources

1065
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:46,380
and it's reallocating it to the sink and

1066
00:42:43,619 --> 00:42:47,760
you actually want to see you know that

1067
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:49,500
reallocation because it means that

1068
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,780
you've actually done your job you've

1069
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:53,099
dialed in your precise nutrients and

1070
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:56,400
you're reallocating what you've already

1071
00:42:53,099 --> 00:42:58,500
given yeah that's a good point you both

1072
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,300
brought up and and Patrick especially I

1073
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:02,579
want to highlight something you said for

1074
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:05,339
folks and that's that um

1075
00:43:02,579 --> 00:43:08,160
it's important to know if a nutrient is

1076
00:43:05,338 --> 00:43:09,179
mobile or in Mobile and if a nutrient is

1077
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:11,759
mobile

1078
00:43:09,179 --> 00:43:14,578
then we're really focused on that new

1079
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:18,660
growth the upper the upper portion of

1080
00:43:14,579 --> 00:43:20,220
the plant and not only are those leaves

1081
00:43:18,659 --> 00:43:23,818
you know down at the bottom not ever

1082
00:43:20,219 --> 00:43:26,279
going to look good again but uh that's

1083
00:43:23,818 --> 00:43:29,460
okay and that doesn't mean that we're

1084
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:32,040
necessarily going to impact

1085
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:34,619
our overall plant health or the economic

1086
00:43:32,039 --> 00:43:35,639
value of that plant so

1087
00:43:34,619 --> 00:43:37,380
um it's something we take for granted

1088
00:43:35,639 --> 00:43:38,759
because people do you know like like you

1089
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:41,280
said Paul people freak out when their

1090
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:42,240
plant uh starts to show any issues at

1091
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:45,000
all

1092
00:43:42,239 --> 00:43:46,379
it's so funny because I'll have people

1093
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,818
and they'll be like oh my plants

1094
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:49,019
finished so well they looked great and

1095
00:43:47,818 --> 00:43:51,420
then they send me the photos and I'm

1096
00:43:49,019 --> 00:43:53,099
like oh my gosh like how did this plant

1097
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:54,539
even survive

1098
00:43:53,099 --> 00:43:56,280
um it looks terrible and then other

1099
00:43:54,539 --> 00:43:57,659
people are like oh man I had a terrible

1100
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:59,519
run and then they send me these plants

1101
00:43:57,659 --> 00:44:01,078
and I'm like dude you crushed it like

1102
00:43:59,519 --> 00:44:03,300
these look great like I would have been

1103
00:44:01,079 --> 00:44:04,920
very very happy with these results so a

1104
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:08,579
lot of it is subjective in that regard

1105
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:10,318
but I do think that we can um

1106
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:13,079
uh we we do need to look at Mobile

1107
00:44:10,318 --> 00:44:15,239
versus immobile nutrients and also just

1108
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:18,359
understand that that these are living

1109
00:44:15,239 --> 00:44:19,559
organisms they're not designed to look

1110
00:44:18,358 --> 00:44:21,719
like

1111
00:44:19,559 --> 00:44:23,400
um what you see on social media all the

1112
00:44:21,719 --> 00:44:26,039
time across your entire facility and all

1113
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:28,260
your plants so that's a that's a very

1114
00:44:26,039 --> 00:44:30,440
good point to make

1115
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:30,440
um

1116
00:44:30,659 --> 00:44:34,618
what else did we want to talk about in

1117
00:44:32,219 --> 00:44:36,358
regards to magnesium did you guys have

1118
00:44:34,619 --> 00:44:37,858
other things to highlight I probably

1119
00:44:36,358 --> 00:44:39,659
have a couple more questions but I want

1120
00:44:37,858 --> 00:44:41,159
to just kind of open the floor here and

1121
00:44:39,659 --> 00:44:41,940
see

1122
00:44:41,159 --> 00:44:44,159
um

1123
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:47,639
what your thoughts were

1124
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:49,739
yeah it's uh one of the big things is

1125
00:44:47,639 --> 00:44:52,559
kind of something we took away from this

1126
00:44:49,739 --> 00:44:54,479
was making sure what your magnesium

1127
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:55,980
levels in your soil are to start off

1128
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:57,719
with

1129
00:44:55,980 --> 00:45:00,240
um we've looked at a handful of

1130
00:44:57,719 --> 00:45:04,399
commercial substrates and some come in

1131
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:07,799
with a major pre-planned charge

1132
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:09,599
in very high magnesium at that so

1133
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:12,839
understanding what's coming in in your

1134
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:14,940
substrate and Then followed up by what's

1135
00:45:12,838 --> 00:45:18,420
in your water if you're on City Water

1136
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:20,579
this may not be a concern for you if

1137
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:22,139
you're on well water this you may

1138
00:45:20,579 --> 00:45:25,019
already have a significant amount of

1139
00:45:22,139 --> 00:45:27,239
magnesium in your water source

1140
00:45:25,019 --> 00:45:29,400
um so as we start to play around with

1141
00:45:27,239 --> 00:45:31,618
you know what magnesium rate works for

1142
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:34,200
your operation it's kind of taking all

1143
00:45:31,619 --> 00:45:37,260
of these factors into effect and both

1144
00:45:34,199 --> 00:45:39,719
looking at your substrate before you uh

1145
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:42,839
utilize that in your operation as well

1146
00:45:39,719 --> 00:45:45,480
as water quality those impact a wide

1147
00:45:42,838 --> 00:45:49,019
array of nutrients just not magnesium

1148
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:50,338
but magnesium is heavily impacted by

1149
00:45:49,019 --> 00:45:52,500
those two it's kind of what we've seen

1150
00:45:50,338 --> 00:45:54,358
that's one of the most common nutrients

1151
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:56,179
that come in in people's water and

1152
00:45:54,358 --> 00:45:59,519
substrates

1153
00:45:56,179 --> 00:46:02,279
that's a good point I wanted to add to

1154
00:45:59,519 --> 00:46:04,800
that in the sense that um

1155
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:08,040
I think everyone should test their water

1156
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:09,839
everyone should test their soil and

1157
00:46:08,039 --> 00:46:12,539
don't assume that the test that you

1158
00:46:09,838 --> 00:46:17,639
receive from the Municipal Water company

1159
00:46:12,539 --> 00:46:20,099
from the commercial soil producer is

1160
00:46:17,639 --> 00:46:22,139
always accurate especially because most

1161
00:46:20,099 --> 00:46:24,480
of these potting soils like ours used a

1162
00:46:22,139 --> 00:46:26,400
fraction of compost and that compost as

1163
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:28,920
much as we want it to be consistent it's

1164
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:30,838
there's always room for variability and

1165
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:33,539
that can lead to

1166
00:46:30,838 --> 00:46:35,039
uh you know your overall potting soil

1167
00:46:33,539 --> 00:46:36,239
having variability so it's just

1168
00:46:35,039 --> 00:46:38,099
something that people need to be aware

1169
00:46:36,239 --> 00:46:40,139
of and account for

1170
00:46:38,099 --> 00:46:41,760
um interestingly enough so I'm on a

1171
00:46:40,139 --> 00:46:43,440
municipal water system in this house

1172
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:46,380
that I moved into

1173
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:49,139
here in Washington state and I reached

1174
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:51,358
out to the water provider and what they

1175
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:53,098
do is they Source from a number of Wells

1176
00:46:51,358 --> 00:46:56,039
to get a more consistent water supply

1177
00:46:53,099 --> 00:46:58,619
they only test for heavy metals so when

1178
00:46:56,039 --> 00:47:00,059
I asked them you know from a gardening

1179
00:46:58,619 --> 00:47:02,940
perspective like what kind of cations

1180
00:47:00,059 --> 00:47:05,000
are coming in in my water they they said

1181
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:08,159
that those are all considered secondary

1182
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,659
elements in in their eyes or variables

1183
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:12,118
and they don't even test for it so I had

1184
00:47:09,659 --> 00:47:13,799
to send in my own test to find out uh

1185
00:47:12,119 --> 00:47:15,720
you know what levels of calcium and

1186
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:17,900
magnesium and sodium were in my water

1187
00:47:15,719 --> 00:47:20,699
which is as you know very important

1188
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:22,619
because we see we tend to see at least

1189
00:47:20,699 --> 00:47:25,259
the water test I see the biggest issues

1190
00:47:22,619 --> 00:47:27,980
I see are usually heavy metals and

1191
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:30,359
salinity so sodium

1192
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:32,818
I haven't seen super high magnesium

1193
00:47:30,358 --> 00:47:34,619
water but that's just I think the areas

1194
00:47:32,818 --> 00:47:36,960
of the country that I've happened to

1195
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:38,519
work with but it's it's absolutely a

1196
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:40,380
concern so

1197
00:47:38,519 --> 00:47:43,338
um Paul you're nodding your head too do

1198
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:43,338
you want to add anything to that

1199
00:47:44,358 --> 00:47:48,960
oh no I'm just saying if you want to see

1200
00:47:46,619 --> 00:47:51,059
some high calcium and magnesium come on

1201
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:53,699
over to Kentucky I'll show you some some

1202
00:47:51,059 --> 00:47:55,679
test results so with that Limestone base

1203
00:47:53,699 --> 00:47:58,799
but yeah no you're absolutely spot on

1204
00:47:55,679 --> 00:48:01,500
it's not something that Municipal uh

1205
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:04,800
water facilities will often test and

1206
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:06,358
also it can vary so for example here in

1207
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:09,000
Kentucky

1208
00:48:06,358 --> 00:48:11,639
um you're just based on where your water

1209
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:14,219
is coming from and you know the the flow

1210
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:16,920
of the groundwater itself you can have

1211
00:48:14,219 --> 00:48:19,679
variability over you know weeks or

1212
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:21,180
months so you know you may dial in and

1213
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:22,739
then test your water three months later

1214
00:48:21,179 --> 00:48:25,019
and your calcium and your magnesium

1215
00:48:22,739 --> 00:48:27,598
could be completely different and so

1216
00:48:25,019 --> 00:48:31,739
that can impact your acidification so

1217
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:33,599
yeah test early test often yeah and for

1218
00:48:31,739 --> 00:48:37,679
those of you that are in

1219
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:41,160
uh the soilless potting soils or living

1220
00:48:37,679 --> 00:48:44,179
soils they're making your own soil I

1221
00:48:41,159 --> 00:48:46,618
tend to not even add a magnesium

1222
00:48:44,179 --> 00:48:49,679
input like I don't I don't like to

1223
00:48:46,619 --> 00:48:50,599
necessarily use Dolomite lime I don't

1224
00:48:49,679 --> 00:48:53,460
use

1225
00:48:50,599 --> 00:48:56,039
silpo mag kmeg whatever you can call it

1226
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:57,780
there's a lot of um inputs I mean you'll

1227
00:48:56,039 --> 00:49:00,259
get a little bit of magnesium from a lot

1228
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:03,119
of different organic soil amendments

1229
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:05,520
already and just with the compost

1230
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:07,740
fraction you probably have some level of

1231
00:49:05,519 --> 00:49:10,679
magnesium sufficiency just based on this

1232
00:49:07,739 --> 00:49:13,139
the number of soil tests I've seen

1233
00:49:10,679 --> 00:49:17,159
and again since it's it's probably the

1234
00:49:13,139 --> 00:49:20,460
easiest organic supplement to add you

1235
00:49:17,159 --> 00:49:22,980
know since we do have access to uh

1236
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:25,500
magnesium sulfate or Epsom salt it's

1237
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:27,358
just it's soluble it's it's just it's

1238
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:29,159
really easy so I it's something that I

1239
00:49:27,358 --> 00:49:31,980
feel like I can always add to my soil

1240
00:49:29,159 --> 00:49:33,838
but like it's much harder to subtract so

1241
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:35,699
I just want to throw that out as sort of

1242
00:49:33,838 --> 00:49:37,559
an ovary for people that are like myself

1243
00:49:35,699 --> 00:49:39,179
you know more on the organic living soil

1244
00:49:37,559 --> 00:49:41,099
side of things

1245
00:49:39,179 --> 00:49:42,239
good

1246
00:49:41,099 --> 00:49:44,338
um

1247
00:49:42,239 --> 00:49:45,899
well guys uh

1248
00:49:44,338 --> 00:49:48,960
I feel like we've really covered

1249
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:49,740
magnesium quite a bit

1250
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:51,300
um

1251
00:49:49,739 --> 00:49:53,818
do you have anything else to add on

1252
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:56,220
magnesium or do you have any future uh

1253
00:49:53,818 --> 00:49:57,719
research that you're excited about right

1254
00:49:56,219 --> 00:49:58,980
now that you're working on or what are

1255
00:49:57,719 --> 00:50:03,019
even just your future plans

1256
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:03,019
professionally for for both of you guys

1257
00:50:04,619 --> 00:50:09,838
um Patrick you want to start us off yeah

1258
00:50:07,858 --> 00:50:14,159
I'll lead into it

1259
00:50:09,838 --> 00:50:15,599
um you know him hemp work wise uh been

1260
00:50:14,159 --> 00:50:16,739
playing around with some other nutrient

1261
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:19,200
work

1262
00:50:16,739 --> 00:50:23,219
um looking at micronutrient uptake

1263
00:50:19,199 --> 00:50:25,739
looking at some amendments to soilless

1264
00:50:23,219 --> 00:50:27,539
substrates and then playing around with

1265
00:50:25,739 --> 00:50:30,719
some different Aggregates and looking at

1266
00:50:27,539 --> 00:50:32,579
substrate ratios is kind of the

1267
00:50:30,719 --> 00:50:36,118
direction that I'm playing around with

1268
00:50:32,579 --> 00:50:38,039
right this moment and that's been it's

1269
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:41,119
been very interesting uh hopefully

1270
00:50:38,039 --> 00:50:44,039
looking to build off that more in 2023

1271
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:46,200
and take that for research we've done

1272
00:50:44,039 --> 00:50:47,039
and take it to the next level

1273
00:50:46,199 --> 00:50:50,460
um

1274
00:50:47,039 --> 00:50:52,259
but then it's just all been soilless

1275
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:54,539
media looking at different blends for me

1276
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:57,720
uh starting to move more

1277
00:50:54,539 --> 00:50:59,519
into uh how to make good soilless

1278
00:50:57,719 --> 00:51:01,078
substrate and look at how to be more

1279
00:50:59,519 --> 00:51:02,699
renewable with it

1280
00:51:01,079 --> 00:51:05,099
um is kind of the direction that I've

1281
00:51:02,699 --> 00:51:07,439
been heading for the 2023

1282
00:51:05,099 --> 00:51:10,260
um and then I know Paul's been looking

1283
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:13,200
at a lot of different him things as well

1284
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:14,900
well uh before we we go over to Paul

1285
00:51:13,199 --> 00:51:18,299
um Patrick if you ever want to look into

1286
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:20,700
uh living soils and reamending the soils

1287
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:23,700
and treating them like an agricultural

1288
00:51:20,699 --> 00:51:25,858
commodity from a state of sustainability

1289
00:51:23,699 --> 00:51:28,799
perspective I think it's it's really

1290
00:51:25,858 --> 00:51:30,299
exciting from a science perspective I

1291
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:31,920
think it's really interesting but it's a

1292
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:34,559
little bit more challenging especially

1293
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:35,639
on the IPM side as I'm sure you guys

1294
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:38,460
know

1295
00:51:35,639 --> 00:51:39,900
um I want to ask you what substrates uh

1296
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:41,039
you're experimenting with right now

1297
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:43,858
because from a sustainability

1298
00:51:41,039 --> 00:51:46,199
perspective I would love to eventually

1299
00:51:43,858 --> 00:51:49,199
move away from coca-core and peat moss

1300
00:51:46,199 --> 00:51:50,879
as sort of the dominant media options in

1301
00:51:49,199 --> 00:51:53,939
our industry

1302
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:55,640
at least on the organic side obviously

1303
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:59,039
rockwool is

1304
00:51:55,639 --> 00:52:00,598
horrible environmentally

1305
00:51:59,039 --> 00:52:03,000
is there anything there because I've

1306
00:52:00,599 --> 00:52:04,680
looked into a few different Medias uh

1307
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,239
option or substrate options and I

1308
00:52:04,679 --> 00:52:08,578
haven't found anything

1309
00:52:06,239 --> 00:52:10,799
that will perform anywhere near the

1310
00:52:08,579 --> 00:52:13,400
levels of what I can get from from peat

1311
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:13,400
moss right now

1312
00:52:13,559 --> 00:52:17,579
I'm still using peat moss as my base

1313
00:52:16,739 --> 00:52:19,500
um

1314
00:52:17,579 --> 00:52:22,619
an individual you may want to look into

1315
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:25,079
his research be Dr Brian Jackson with NC

1316
00:52:22,619 --> 00:52:26,300
State he's done a lot of work with wood

1317
00:52:25,079 --> 00:52:29,940
fiber

1318
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:31,400
so just looking at using pine trees to

1319
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:34,079
completely replace

1320
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:36,660
p and all the other Aggregates and they

1321
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:39,240
have looked at a lot of different peat

1322
00:52:36,659 --> 00:52:40,199
Blends and other wood Blends

1323
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:43,019
um

1324
00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:45,239
in order to try and dial that in he has

1325
00:52:43,019 --> 00:52:46,858
done some work with him Paul could

1326
00:52:45,239 --> 00:52:50,039
probably make a little bit better

1327
00:52:46,858 --> 00:52:52,619
comment on his hemp work

1328
00:52:50,039 --> 00:52:54,239
um but he does a lot of wood fibers and

1329
00:52:52,619 --> 00:52:56,160
alternative substrate to completely

1330
00:52:54,239 --> 00:52:58,500
replace Pete

1331
00:52:56,159 --> 00:53:00,358
um but that's

1332
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:02,338
probably the most prominent one that

1333
00:53:00,358 --> 00:53:04,078
I've heard of completely alternative to

1334
00:53:02,338 --> 00:53:06,539
Corn Pete

1335
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:11,940
I I've looked into that a bit I've been

1336
00:53:06,539 --> 00:53:15,058
a bit stymied either on uh price or on

1337
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:16,619
I get I guess growth metrics but I I

1338
00:53:15,059 --> 00:53:18,359
haven't given a pope I I feel like

1339
00:53:16,619 --> 00:53:20,640
there's something there's something

1340
00:53:18,358 --> 00:53:22,019
there but

1341
00:53:20,639 --> 00:53:23,699
um yeah I would love to I would love to

1342
00:53:22,019 --> 00:53:25,500
talk to him down the road I think you

1343
00:53:23,699 --> 00:53:27,000
guys in did an introduction so I need to

1344
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:28,679
follow up on those emails and see if I

1345
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,838
can keep pestering them to get him on

1346
00:53:28,679 --> 00:53:34,818
the podcast

1347
00:53:30,838 --> 00:53:34,818
yeah uh how about you Paul

1348
00:53:36,539 --> 00:53:42,480
well I'll go into my future here in just

1349
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:45,960
a sec I wanted to make one comment that

1350
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:48,358
um I think part of the reason why

1351
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:50,338
um coca-core and Pete has become a bit

1352
00:53:48,358 --> 00:53:52,199
of an issue

1353
00:53:50,338 --> 00:53:54,480
um is kind of the

1354
00:53:52,199 --> 00:53:56,699
The General

1355
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:59,280
a general theme in agriculture is we

1356
00:53:56,699 --> 00:54:01,199
tend to find one thing that works and we

1357
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:04,260
tend to just use it use it use it use it

1358
00:54:01,199 --> 00:54:06,118
and use it and if you look at um true

1359
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:08,280
sustainability you know like a

1360
00:54:06,119 --> 00:54:10,318
diversified Network it's kind of like a

1361
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:12,540
good Investment Portfolio you want to

1362
00:54:10,318 --> 00:54:15,599
have a diversified portfolio you want to

1363
00:54:12,539 --> 00:54:19,259
have a diverse product and diverse

1364
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:21,119
products that you can build into the

1365
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:22,740
system and and that goes with pretty

1366
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:26,460
much anything you know fertilizers

1367
00:54:22,739 --> 00:54:28,379
substrates Etc and I think that really

1368
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:30,480
where a lot of the future research is

1369
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:32,338
going to have value is finding those

1370
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:34,619
things that won't completely replace

1371
00:54:32,338 --> 00:54:37,380
something but are going to help move us

1372
00:54:34,619 --> 00:54:39,900
towards a diversified portfolio so that

1373
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:42,480
we start alleviating stress and start

1374
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:45,000
moving these industries to be more of a

1375
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:48,000
sustainable consumption

1376
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:49,920
um you know and obviously moving more

1377
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,440
and more towards as sustainable as we

1378
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:54,300
can get but just wanted to add that as

1379
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:58,139
well so you're saying even if we just

1380
00:54:54,300 --> 00:55:00,780
added 20 wood fiber to our

1381
00:54:58,139 --> 00:55:02,639
our substrate recipe that's going to

1382
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:05,339
have a dramatic impact

1383
00:55:02,639 --> 00:55:06,900
um in a beneficial way towards our

1384
00:55:05,338 --> 00:55:10,880
overall sustainability even if we're not

1385
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:10,880
completely replacing Peter core

1386
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:20,460
I'm not a substrate specialist so I mean

1387
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:22,019
I'll let Jackson come on here I'll let

1388
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:23,818
Jackson come on here and answer that

1389
00:55:22,019 --> 00:55:25,318
question but yes theoretically from a

1390
00:55:23,818 --> 00:55:28,019
conceptual thing if you're even

1391
00:55:25,318 --> 00:55:30,838
replacing just 20 that's 20 before

1392
00:55:28,019 --> 00:55:33,179
that's that's fair you scientists are so

1393
00:55:30,838 --> 00:55:35,358
so good about not speaking out of your

1394
00:55:33,179 --> 00:55:35,358
lane

1395
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:44,460
yeah yeah well that's that's why Jackson

1396
00:55:41,219 --> 00:55:45,539
has so much value so what what's in the

1397
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:47,519
future for you

1398
00:55:45,539 --> 00:55:50,058
um are you getting close to uh to

1399
00:55:47,519 --> 00:55:50,059
graduating

1400
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:58,260
yeah so right now I'm slated to graduate

1401
00:55:54,358 --> 00:55:59,699
fall of 2024 or spring of 2025.

1402
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:03,240
um obviously in the research world

1403
00:55:59,699 --> 00:56:04,919
nothing is ever a hardcore perfect set

1404
00:56:03,239 --> 00:56:06,598
um timeline you know you could have a

1405
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:08,039
bad ear you could have a crop failure

1406
00:56:06,599 --> 00:56:09,599
especially when you're doing field level

1407
00:56:08,039 --> 00:56:12,239
stuff

1408
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:14,240
um but as far as uh for me you know like

1409
00:56:12,239 --> 00:56:17,759
I said focusing more on germination

1410
00:56:14,239 --> 00:56:19,199
establishment rhizosphere metrics so

1411
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:21,720
right now really what we're doing

1412
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:23,639
heavily is looking at roots and trying

1413
00:56:21,719 --> 00:56:25,139
to image those roots and figure out how

1414
00:56:23,639 --> 00:56:27,239
root phenotypes and how they're actually

1415
00:56:25,139 --> 00:56:29,098
growing to help us with the rhizosphere

1416
00:56:27,239 --> 00:56:31,799
management

1417
00:56:29,099 --> 00:56:33,059
um but um as far as what I want to do

1418
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:35,339
for the future

1419
00:56:33,059 --> 00:56:37,920
um you know I I love research I've

1420
00:56:35,338 --> 00:56:39,719
always been insatiably curious

1421
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:41,159
um you know and I love being able to

1422
00:56:39,719 --> 00:56:42,838
take that research and not just have it

1423
00:56:41,159 --> 00:56:45,118
be some sort of

1424
00:56:42,838 --> 00:56:46,558
data that sits there but actually

1425
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:48,838
turning it into a meaningful and

1426
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:50,099
applicable story for people

1427
00:56:48,838 --> 00:56:52,858
um and one that's actually going to help

1428
00:56:50,099 --> 00:56:54,660
the industry and Growers so for for my

1429
00:56:52,858 --> 00:56:56,519
future I don't know if that's industry I

1430
00:56:54,659 --> 00:56:58,980
don't know if Academia but I know that

1431
00:56:56,519 --> 00:57:00,659
definitely that that Outreach

1432
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:02,760
um with with Growers and with the

1433
00:57:00,659 --> 00:57:05,159
industry and and specifically research

1434
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:07,260
and development would definitely be an

1435
00:57:05,159 --> 00:57:08,578
Avenue that I'm that's the exciting

1436
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:10,079
thing about this crop right and I think

1437
00:57:08,579 --> 00:57:11,220
that's the reason all of us are here is

1438
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:13,318
because

1439
00:57:11,219 --> 00:57:17,399
we feel like there's so much more to

1440
00:57:13,318 --> 00:57:18,659
learn and we don't have all the answers

1441
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:20,760
um like I think corn would be really

1442
00:57:18,659 --> 00:57:22,799
boring now like the research has been

1443
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:26,660
done like we're on a new frontier here

1444
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:26,660
and I think that's so exciting

1445
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:32,400
um

1446
00:57:28,619 --> 00:57:34,140
yeah well and Grain and fiber too I mean

1447
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:36,780
I know that you know that's not your

1448
00:57:34,139 --> 00:57:39,000
your focus necessarily here Tad but like

1449
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:40,980
you know don't don't underestimate the

1450
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:43,380
value that those could have as a

1451
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:46,199
launched commodity

1452
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:49,858
um as well and again it will just add

1453
00:57:46,199 --> 00:57:53,058
more research dollars and more value to

1454
00:57:49,858 --> 00:57:54,838
this industry in in all of its avenues

1455
00:57:53,059 --> 00:57:56,940
that would be an interesting topic

1456
00:57:54,838 --> 00:58:00,480
because I don't really know a lot about

1457
00:57:56,940 --> 00:58:02,760
the fiber side of things it just hasn't

1458
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:05,880
been a focus and I'd be curious to know

1459
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:07,619
where what opportunities exist in that

1460
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:09,780
industry as infrastructure for

1461
00:58:07,619 --> 00:58:12,559
processing the fiber grows as demand for

1462
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:12,559
the fiber grows

1463
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:16,260
yeah I think that would be I think that

1464
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:20,540
would be really interesting

1465
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:20,540
so maybe that's a future podcast topic

1466
00:58:21,179 --> 00:58:25,259
uh all right so last question before we

1467
00:58:23,159 --> 00:58:26,879
sign off have you guys done any work

1468
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:29,400
with biostimulants so looking

1469
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:35,119
specifically at microbes and their role

1470
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:35,119
in uh nutrient uptake in the rhizosphere

1471
00:58:35,159 --> 00:58:39,899
um is that something either of you have

1472
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:41,940
a an interest in or have done any

1473
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:44,519
research on

1474
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:46,139
or see future research

1475
00:58:44,519 --> 00:58:48,780
so

1476
00:58:46,139 --> 00:58:50,400
as as far as the work that was done at

1477
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:53,660
NC State

1478
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:56,700
um there there we did not look into

1479
00:58:53,659 --> 00:59:00,298
biostimulants or bio additives

1480
00:58:56,699 --> 00:59:02,699
um um so that was some research that um

1481
00:59:00,298 --> 00:59:04,019
a few a few companies that expressed

1482
00:59:02,699 --> 00:59:06,179
interest in

1483
00:59:04,019 --> 00:59:08,699
um but it just you know sometimes the

1484
00:59:06,179 --> 00:59:12,239
Stars don't align as far as the the

1485
00:59:08,699 --> 00:59:13,379
funding or follow through so you know

1486
00:59:12,239 --> 00:59:16,139
it's just

1487
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:18,298
it it's definitely an area that needs to

1488
00:59:16,139 --> 00:59:21,019
be studied there's a wealth of knowledge

1489
00:59:18,298 --> 00:59:24,420
out there that shows just how much value

1490
00:59:21,019 --> 00:59:26,818
these these microbial communities can

1491
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:29,760
have not only to the plant but also to

1492
00:59:26,818 --> 00:59:32,699
the network to you know the the

1493
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:34,440
rhizosphere to you know nutrient cycling

1494
00:59:32,699 --> 00:59:36,598
nutrient availability and everything

1495
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:39,659
something that you know you live and

1496
00:59:36,599 --> 00:59:41,220
breathe Tad with you and your company

1497
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:45,058
and the excellent work that you guys do

1498
00:59:41,219 --> 00:59:47,159
but uh who knows maybe uh future I I

1499
00:59:45,059 --> 00:59:49,740
believe it's the future of agriculture

1500
00:59:47,159 --> 00:59:53,399
in a lot of ways as we hit Peak

1501
00:59:49,739 --> 00:59:56,098
phosphorus as we see limitations in

1502
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:58,500
supplies we need to figure out ways to

1503
00:59:56,099 --> 01:00:00,660
better utilize the nutrients and

1504
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:03,239
elements that are available and that's

1505
01:00:00,659 --> 01:00:06,239
where I think you know these microbes

1506
01:00:03,239 --> 01:00:08,639
are so complex it's really daunting to

1507
01:00:06,239 --> 01:00:10,500
try and study it because they have a

1508
01:00:08,639 --> 01:00:12,779
synergistic effect you can't just

1509
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:14,039
isolate one and expect to understand it

1510
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:17,160
fully and

1511
01:00:14,039 --> 01:00:19,920
it's a bit of a

1512
01:00:17,159 --> 01:00:21,598
yeah it's it kind of hurts my brain to

1513
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:24,838
think about it or even begin to try and

1514
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:26,760
construct a a reasonable research study

1515
01:00:24,838 --> 01:00:28,199
around it but I do think there's

1516
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:30,000
something there even if we can't fully

1517
01:00:28,199 --> 01:00:31,980
understand it at this point

1518
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:34,039
so

1519
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:34,039
yeah

1520
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:37,619
yeah I couldn't agree more well uh I

1521
01:00:36,298 --> 01:00:39,719
just want to thank both of you for your

1522
01:00:37,619 --> 01:00:42,000
time today for sharing your research for

1523
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:44,639
doing this research and the impact it

1524
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,440
has and benefits for Growers you know

1525
01:00:44,639 --> 01:00:48,298
like myself that are always interested

1526
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:51,838
in learning more so I hope we can stay

1527
01:00:48,298 --> 01:00:53,338
in touch and continue to to share this

1528
01:00:51,838 --> 01:00:56,179
information so Growers can do a better

1529
01:00:53,338 --> 01:00:56,179
job in their Gardens

1530
