effort to unravel the complexities of

18
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:57,878
cannabis soil and crop nutrition along

19
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:59,600
with his work on soilless media he also

20

just give a quick background about

47
00:01:57,879 --> 00:02:01,319
yourself here and then we'll Dive Right

48
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:05,359
In

49
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:08,959
sure my name is Bryant Mason and I am a

50
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:11,639
certified crop advisor I work

51
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:14,280
with many different Growers across

52
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:18,238
various crop types primarily cannabis

53
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:22,280
but also tree fruit Diversified

54
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:24,519
vegetables um any high value crop um

55
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:29,159
more and more cut

56
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:32,680
flowers and I've had my own business for

57
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:35,560
five or six years and before that um I

58
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:37,400
was doing a lot of Consulting under

59
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:40,920
other people's businesses and I've been

60
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:44,480
a grower I also have uh my own Farm it's

61
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:47,839
an 11 Acre Farm in western Colorado um

62
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:50,000
my I have dozens of different crops

63
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,878
vegetables and diversified fruit but my

64
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,919
primary cash crop is Peaches and I do a

65
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:58,359
lot of experimentation in my Orchard so

66
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:01,878
I specialize in nutrient management and

67
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:06,319
more specifically um I just do organic

68
00:03:01,878 --> 00:03:09,359
nutrient management so I am

69
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:11,359
constantly working with Growers and and

70
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,519
exploring and learning about uh

71
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,480
nutrition so I'm sure we'll talk about

72
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,920
some of that today and we can just go

73
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:20,439
from

74
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:22,439
there great yeah I mean I know that one

75
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:24,120
of the first things uh that you want to

76
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:26,479
talk about were some of these specific

77
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,319
minerals um so let's just let's just

78
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:30,479
Dive Right In with that and kind of just

79
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:33,238
share what's been on your brain lately

80
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:38,280
yeah sure so I I would say in 2023 there

81
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:40,319
were three nutrients that I kept

82
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:43,318
thinking about and coming back to in

83
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:44,878
various um situations I was working with

84
00:03:43,318 --> 00:03:47,839
Growers and actually in my own peach

85
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:51,560
orchard the first what is calcium I

86
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,719
think calcium has always been a very

87
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,000
interesting nutrient for me I've always

88
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:59,120
been drawn to

89
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,318
calcium um one of my general beliefs is

90
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,759
that it's been

91
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:06,158
calcium has been

92
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:09,519
fairly um deprioritized in agriculture

93
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:12,000
for the value that it provides to to

94
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:15,199
plant health and yield and so uh I'm

95
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,798
always thinking about calcium

96
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:19,759
and there's one thing there there's a

97
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:21,319
there's essentially three things that I

98
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,800
think the Cannabis Community has

99
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:26,319
generally accepted around calcium it's

100
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:29,199
the use of lime and gypsum in relatively

101
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:30,680
High quantities to to push calcium up in

102
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:34,680
soil

103
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:36,400
um the use of calcium foliar and we can

104
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,800
talk about that and then the final thing

105
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:41,359
is just proper irrigation and watering

106
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,560
technique to really make sure that the

107
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,919
transpiration stream is moving calcium

108
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,959
into the parts of the plant that it's

109
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:50,359
needed but I had a

110
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:52,959
conversation with I've had multiple

111
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:54,639
conversations um with apple Growers and

112
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:57,560
I think there's one thing that's missing

113
00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:00,038
in the Cannabis Community conversation

114
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:02,800
around calcium that I wanted to share

115
00:05:00,038 --> 00:05:05,038
and just to take a step back the reason

116
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,800
Apple Growers know more about calcium

117
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:11,038
than any other group of growers in my

118
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:13,280
opinion is because um Apple Growers

119
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:14,599
suffer from a disorder called bitter pit

120
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:18,159
so I don't know if you know this but in

121
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:21,080
your home state um specifically Eastern

122
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,919
Washington 90%

123
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:27,839
of the organic apples are grown in

124
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:29,719
Eastern Washington and a lot of those

125
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:31,159
apples are honey crisp because people

126
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,800
love honey crisp a little too sweet for

127
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:36,319
my liking but it's a good crunchy apple

128
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,160
and it it is very susceptible to Bitter

129
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:40,960
pit with which is actually a calcium

130
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:45,080
disorder and these Growers make a lot of

131
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:47,638
money on selling um honey crisp apples

132
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:50,159
but sometimes they can only sell half of

133
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:52,439
the apples that they harvest because in

134
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,240
storage they they get this bitter pit

135
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:57,120
this calcium Disorder so they have

136
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:00,800
figured out how to go from let's say 50%

137
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,439
packout to 95% pack out and I I've

138
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:07,400
spoken to these Growers at length about

139
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:10,519
how they do that and number one a pretty

140
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:12,519
basic yearly application of one ton per

141
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:14,758
acre of gypsum banded in the rows of the

142
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:16,519
trees so again I think cannabis Growers

143
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:19,199
are already applying gypsum I recommend

144
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:21,359
it in I would say moderate doses in the

145
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:24,319
majority of my recommendations I'm not

146
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:28,000
alone I think you know you you use

147
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:30,439
gypsum everyone seems to use gypsum um

148
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,598
gypsum can be applied at way higher

149
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:35,399
quantities and the reason for this is

150
00:06:32,598 --> 00:06:39,639
because the solubility of gypsum is is

151
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:41,679
relatively low and so anything um it has

152
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:43,280
a low salt index so all ferti

153
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,079
fertilizers have a salt index and

154
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:47,799
gypsums is relatively low because the

155
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:50,560
solubility is relatively low so if you

156
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:53,038
apply excess gypsum let's say four tons

157
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:56,280
per acre or in the case of a Pete based

158
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:58,800
media like 25 pounds per yard or even

159
00:06:56,279 --> 00:07:00,839
Growers do more sometimes it just sits

160
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,720
as calcium sulfate it doesn't dissolve

161
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:04,598
any further into the into the solution

162
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,080
so it doesn't create too much salt

163
00:07:04,598 --> 00:07:10,120
stress obviously gypsum will increase

164
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:11,839
the EC of the soil but not um

165
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:14,519
excessively where it'll burn the plant

166
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:17,560
or create excessive osmotic

167
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:21,198
stress okay so gypsum is number one the

168
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:24,839
second thing that they do is they are

169
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,840
constantly thinking about soil moisture

170
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:28,719
and

171
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:32,519
weighing consistent soil moisture versus

172
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:35,440
dryback because like cannabis production

173
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:39,038
there are reasons to dry back fruit

174
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:41,319
trees at critical times to do different

175
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:43,839
things for fruit development and so

176
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:45,720
they're constantly aware that when they

177
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:47,478
dry back their soil they're going to

178
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,159
reduce calcium uptake so they would

179
00:07:47,478 --> 00:07:51,158
never dry back their soil at a critical

180
00:07:49,158 --> 00:07:53,719
point when they want calcium uptake

181
00:07:51,158 --> 00:07:55,598
during cell division so that's I think

182
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,440
we sort of understand that the third

183
00:07:55,598 --> 00:08:00,079
thing is foliar and this this is where

184
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:03,399
it gets a little more interesting

185
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:05,120
according to the guys I've talked to who

186
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:08,318
have essentially eliminated bitter pit

187
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,519
in apples they don't think a few foliar

188
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:13,720
do

189
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:17,038
anything but they are dead set on foler

190
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:19,319
spraying to get that extra 10% of

191
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:22,279
calcium into the plant and they do folur

192
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:23,598
every 48 hours during cell division so

193
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:25,519
they don't think just doing a couple

194
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:28,439
folur is going to do is going to

195
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:30,719
influence calcium very much and so

196
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:33,240
instead they double or triple down on

197
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,240
calcium folur and during the cell

198
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:38,320
division period of of Apple development

199
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,560
they're often applying a foler every 48

200
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,039
hours which

201
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:45,159
is is pretty

202
00:08:42,038 --> 00:08:46,879
intense from a management standpoint

203
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:52,399
yeah I would think I I immediately think

204
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:54,559
of issues with uh labor humidity um

205
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,039
product costs I mean there's a ton of

206
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:58,719
things that pop up yeah let's talk about

207
00:08:56,039 --> 00:09:00,360
that so let's let's group labor and

208
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,160
product cost into the same category

209
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:06,200
because it's it's they're both dollars

210
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:08,559
and when you grow a high value crop the

211
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:10,680
difference between 50% packout and 100%

212
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:12,879
packout in honey crisp apples is like on

213
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:15,958
a thousand acres is millions of dollarss

214
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:19,000
so they pay for it um he believes this

215
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:21,119
is what's he the the guy Steve and I

216
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,159
spoke to believe he still thinks that

217
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,759
let's just say 90% of the calcium is

218
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:29,159
taken up by the soil but just that extra

219
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:31,200
10% INF foler is giving him that

220
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:33,639
increase in bitter pit enough to pay for

221
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,480
all the labor all the diesel I mean

222
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:38,480
these this is hundreds if not yeah

223
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,839
hundreds of Acres so he they can justify

224
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,480
it and I think there are certain

225
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,839
instances in any high value crop where

226
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,200
you can justify it but it's excessive

227
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:48,720
what's interesting to me is I've always

228
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:51,480
had this sort of internal bias that I

229
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,200
I'm I'm all about the soil and so I do

230
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,959
folur I always have but I'm I'm I'm sort

231
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:58,160
of a constant skeptic about how much is

232
00:09:55,958 --> 00:10:02,039
making it into the plant um so that was

233
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:04,719
sort of validating to here H okay the

234
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:07,519
fourth thing and this is what I think is

235
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:10,360
most interesting and most missed in the

236
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:14,679
Cannabis conversation is the number of

237
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:17,879
new shoots and the rate of Chute growth

238
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:21,879
is massively important for the use of

239
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:24,838
calcium so any any growing Chute

240
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:26,000
requires a tremendous amount of calcium

241
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:30,000
and

242
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,919
so in apple production are preventing

243
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,039
terminal growth and they're actually

244
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:39,199
summer pruning usually in like May to

245
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:41,679
prevent too many growing shoots because

246
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:45,240
when you have too many growing shoots

247
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:47,319
you're it's a it's an enormous calcium

248
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,200
requirement for the plant and I saw that

249
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:53,240
in my Orchard there was a pest that

250
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:55,759
essentially ate the top of every um

251
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:58,680
shoot I sprayed just a couple days too

252
00:10:55,759 --> 00:11:02,319
late and so what happened is it

253
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:03,799
essentially topped my my plant imagine

254
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,320
topping a cannabis plant well I did that

255
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:07,559
to every shoot on my tree which then

256
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:09,200
turned into four new shoots so I

257
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:12,638
quadrupled the number of new growing

258
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:14,639
shoots on my trees and that I'm fairly

259
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:16,519
confident created a Calcium deficiency

260
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:18,278
so this is a very long- winded way to

261
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:20,399
summarize what I've been thinking about

262
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:23,320
with calcium but I think cannabis

263
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:25,879
Growers need to think about the number

264
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:28,560
of of

265
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:29,879
um the number of shots that are actively

266
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:32,799
growing the rate at which they're

267
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:34,639
growing because the the there's a

268
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:36,359
there's a piece of calcium I have never

269
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:38,720
been able to figure out which is often

270
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:41,079
times I'll see sufficient calcium on a

271
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:44,639
paast tests let's just say 150 to 200

272
00:11:41,078 --> 00:11:47,000
parts per million I'll see 80% base

273
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:51,120
saturation which I don't put much weight

274
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,919
on but I know a lot of Growers do so by

275
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,320
those two metrics calcium is sufficient

276
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:58,240
in the soil the grower is doing calcium

277
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:00,040
folur and their VPD is good and their

278
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,879
soil moisture is relatively good maybe

279
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:04,519
they're even using blue mats and

280
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:06,320
measuring it and so but then I get

281
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:07,919
tissue test results back and the calcium

282
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,440
is still at let's say three and a half

283
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:12,120
or 4% and the other thing I'll add is

284
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,880
there's not an excess of magnesium or

285
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:17,600
pottassium that antagonize calcium

286
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:20,519
uptake and the only other thing in that

287
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,759
grand picture of calcium is the number

288
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:25,000
of growing choots and the rate of

289
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:27,078
growth so I'm just going to stop there

290
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,879
and throw that out there for for

291
00:12:27,078 --> 00:12:34,078
listeners to kind of chew on over the

292
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:34,078
next several months or the next growing

293
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:40,399
cycle I have some many thoughts and

294
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:43,039
questions yeah so I mean that would be

295
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:45,720
one reason it'd be more advantageous to

296
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:48,078
grow more plants to create a canopy

297
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:50,320
versus a single plant just for the

298
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:52,879
ability of the plant to move calcium

299
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,240
effectively to all the shoots that are

300
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:59,480
creating the

301
00:12:54,240 --> 00:13:02,519
canopy um but uh getting back to the

302
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:05,560
calcium example when I think of

303
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:08,320
calcium um one of the things I think

304
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:12,078
about is evapo transpiration because

305
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:13,920
calcium moves through the xylem and I

306
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:15,559
always I always confuse the too but I

307
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:17,838
think I got it right this time because

308
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:21,000
it moves through the xylm it it's very

309
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:22,839
linked to transpiration reach which then

310
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,278
moves me over to thinking about

311
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:28,160
environment and

312
00:13:24,278 --> 00:13:30,519
VPD um so when I think about calcium

313
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:32,759
movement in the plant or out to the leaf

314
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:34,759
surface that's where my brain goes first

315
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:37,039
is moisture levels in the soil and

316
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:39,039
environment um around the plant now I

317
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:42,879
don't know how you would manipulate that

318
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:43,879
in um an apple orchard but I wonder

319
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:46,759
about

320
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:49,039
like is that I mean should that be the

321
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:50,360
first way we approach calcium because

322
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:51,639
when I listen to this podcast I'm

323
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,120
wondering if people are going to think

324
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:57,039
oh this I just need to be spraying

325
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:58,799
calcium like crazy onto my plant and it

326
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:01,078
sounds to me like like the way you're

327
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:03,078
describing it that is the last 10% like

328
00:14:01,078 --> 00:14:05,278
there's all these other things that need

329
00:14:03,078 --> 00:14:09,120
to be in place first yeah I want to

330
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:11,958
reiterate that I think that folur are at

331
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:14,320
best 10% this is I I don't have any uh

332
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:17,078
hard evidence for this this is just my

333
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:19,440
intuition but no I think I think folur

334
00:14:17,078 --> 00:14:22,278
are the last thing to think about um

335
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,440
okay I think I think what you're saying

336
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:28,000
is more accurate because another another

337
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:29,279
anecdote is the um tomato Growers who

338
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,958
experience

339
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:34,320
Blossom endrot another calcium disorder

340
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:37,078
it's often inconsistent soil moisture

341
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,360
where the dry backs are too big and

342
00:14:37,078 --> 00:14:40,958
calcium uptake

343
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:43,680
stops so I I agree with you but I think

344
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:46,159
once you cover soil moisture and VPD

345
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:48,919
there's very few other toggles that we

346
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:51,360
have to increase transpiration I mean um

347
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:52,519
air flow I suppose like but I think

348
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,399
that's similar

349
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:57,720
to yeah air flow over the leaf surface I

350
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:59,799
think would be a right thing to look at

351
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:02,240
there but so airflow over the leaf

352
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:04,879
surface VPD and soil moisture I don't

353
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,799
know what else we can

354
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:08,879
manipulate I think that's it but I

355
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:11,359
wonder if you're spraying calcium every

356
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:13,600
48 hours are you creating pathogen

357
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,959
pressure or is the well so in indoor

358
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,639
cannabis production I that's not

359
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:19,359
something I would recommend that's just

360
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:21,278
an anecdote from the Apple industry um

361
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,519
yeah yeah I mean for the Apple industry

362
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:24,759
though I would think You' just be open

363
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:26,720
yourself up to a variety of different

364
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:30,000
well so the beauty of Eastern Washington

365
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,399
as you know those Cascade Mountains wild

366
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,278
you you're probably it's probably

367
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:35,879
raining outside right now for you um

368
00:15:34,278 --> 00:15:38,600
Eastern Washington's different though

369
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:42,639
it's a very B dry it's bone dry so when

370
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:45,199
you foler it it the I one of the primary

371
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,759
reasons there's all all the apples are

372
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:49,039
produced over there is the dry climate

373
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:50,879
reduces disease pressure it's way easier

374
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:52,480
to be an organic grower in Eastern

375
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:54,278
Washington than it is to grow apples in

376
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,759
Michigan or New York or really anywhere

377
00:15:54,278 --> 00:15:58,360
else it's part of the reason I like

378
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,959
Western Colorado the air is just bone

379
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:02,720
dry

380
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:05,838
so there's probably lower Spore pressure

381
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:08,399
uh way lower yeah yeah the VPD is not

382
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:10,279
balanced necessarily in these dry I mean

383
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,679
in these outdoor dry environments it's

384
00:16:10,278 --> 00:16:16,480
it's it's too dry the humidity is just

385
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:18,198
too low um for for optimal VPD but what

386
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,800
that means is very low disease pressure

387
00:16:18,198 --> 00:16:23,399
so there's a trade-off

388
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:25,919
there yeah so you

389
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:28,039
um you talk about all

390
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:30,159
these you talked about cell division

391
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:32,360
let's start there actually so you said

392
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:33,838
when the plants at uh levels where it's

393
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:36,240
doing its highest cell division we can

394
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:38,680
Target dryb backs and things like that

395
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:41,879
do we really know in

396
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:43,838
cannabis when those moments are that

397
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:48,039
that we that we should be triggering

398
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:50,600
dryb backs or considering them so the

399
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:52,599
cell division is for the Apple

400
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:56,360
production it's cell division of the

401
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:59,319
fruit which is you know a 30-day period

402
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:01,519
after pollination and so that's when

403
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:03,799
they're doing so they they've identified

404
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:07,359
a what they would call a critical point

405
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:09,599
in the in the fruit life cycle where

406
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:11,318
they do the fers every 48 hours it's not

407
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,558
all season it's like for two to four

408
00:17:11,318 --> 00:17:15,838
weeks after

409
00:17:12,558 --> 00:17:17,678
pollination I do not think that there's

410
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:20,279
a critical growth period that's been

411
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:23,600
identified in cannabis production when

412
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:25,078
calcium is needed the most and in fact

413
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:29,079
it seems to me like it's needed

414
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:30,798
throughout the entire growth cycle so

415
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:32,879
again there's just a difference there

416
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:35,839
it's not an apple it's a cannabis plant

417
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:39,520
so I generally believe that it's

418
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:41,558
especially needed in veg I think it's

419
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:44,759
critically important

420
00:17:41,558 --> 00:17:46,918
to maximize calcium uptake in Veg it's

421
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:51,558
hard to overdo it in organic production

422
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:54,320
i' I've never seen it overdone um and so

423
00:17:51,558 --> 00:17:56,000
I think the reason that that it's that

424
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:57,839
it's so important in veg is not because

425
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,400
it's a critical point of influence it's

426
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:02,119
just because you can't get it back once

427
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,919
you're at week four of flour you're not

428
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:06,918
going to you're not going to catch up if

429
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:09,799
your calcium uptake wasn't high enough

430
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:12,759
and what I've sort of seen through years

431
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:14,679
of working with cannabis Growers is the

432
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:16,879
highest yielding plants have to have

433
00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:20,640
enough calcium going into

434
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:23,320
flour and I also believe that the lowest

435
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,759
disease pressure and just the the the

436
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:28,759
best Vigor and general plant health

437
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:30,919
comes from sufficient calcium levels so

438
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:32,798
the reason I like focusing on veg is

439
00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:35,559
because you don't you don't want to play

440
00:18:32,798 --> 00:18:37,599
catchup with calcium like you mentioned

441
00:18:35,558 --> 00:18:39,558
it's movement is in the the

442
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:43,519
transpiration stream the water going up

443
00:18:39,558 --> 00:18:45,720
through the xylem and so um you just you

444
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:49,440
just want to maintain that that stream

445
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:52,159
of calcium throughout the entire cycle

446
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,519
the entire life of the

447
00:18:52,159 --> 00:18:57,080
plant so let's let's talk about this

448
00:18:54,519 --> 00:19:02,319
from sort of a

449
00:18:57,079 --> 00:19:05,839
um uh I guess a more like applied uh

450
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:07,879
real world usage example so great you

451
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:09,839
know you've talked about gypsum and I'm

452
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,280
going to say things here that a lot of

453
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:12,359
Growers already know but I just want to

454
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:15,079
make sure we're not miss anything you

455
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:19,000
know gypsum calcium sulfate it's not

456
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:20,720
really going to impact the pH um the you

457
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,720
really can't overdo sulfur from what

458
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:26,079
I've seen so it's a really great form of

459
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:28,720
calcium and there's a lot of different

460
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:30,119
ways to get gypsum um you do want to

461
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,240
watch heavy metals because they will

462
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:35,399
vary across gypsum sources and the

463
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:38,279
smaller the particulate the more soluble

464
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,720
it is uh the more available it's going

465
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:41,119
to be the plant because it has a larger

466
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,200
surface area and that goes for all

467
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:44,639
amendments um anything else really

468
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,640
quickly want about calcium before we

469
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,799
talk a little bit about some of these

470
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:50,600
other limes and other

471
00:19:47,798 --> 00:19:51,798
options um well yeah I was going to say

472
00:19:50,599 --> 00:19:53,158
we last tonight but we'll talk about

473
00:19:51,798 --> 00:19:54,960
that the only other thing I'd say just

474
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:57,720
in that in the particle size

475
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,840
conversation is um I think it's a really

476
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:04,159
good technique to diversify the particle

477
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:06,399
size of the gypsum so

478
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:09,039
which so yeah let's just say you're

479
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:11,200
doing a pre-plant Amendment usually I'd

480
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:13,839
recommend a powdered

481
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:16,640
gypsum often a solution grade gypsum

482
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:18,558
partially because you can also feed that

483
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,440
or top dress it in the middle of the

484
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:22,798
cycle so it's just nice to have one

485
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:24,120
gypsum product on hand and use it as a

486
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:26,679
pre-plant Amendment and also in the

487
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:28,719
middle of the round but there is a

488
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:30,840
technique to use a granular gypson which

489
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,440
might you know just release a little bit

490
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:34,158
slower technically it's not a slow

491
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:36,320
releasing fertilizer and in theory if

492
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:38,679
you Dro a granular gypsum in water it

493
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:40,839
should dissolve into its

494
00:20:38,679 --> 00:20:43,679
constituent particles that are just the

495
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:47,240
same size as the solution grade but um

496
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:49,200
in in practice it it does take a little

497
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:51,839
bit more time so it it acts sort of as a

498
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,480
slow release fertilizer um that's one

499
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:55,879
technique especially if you're running a

500
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:58,919
lot of water through your soil like if

501
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:01,440
you are watering to run off um which I'd

502
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:03,280
say most living soil Growers aren't but

503
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,759
if that's the case you are going to be

504
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:07,599
flushing some of that solution grade

505
00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:09,519
gypsum out of your system constantly so

506
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,759
uh having granular gypsum might help and

507
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:13,079
the only other thing I mentioned is

508
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:15,919
sulfur from Gypsum I don't think can be

509
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:16,879
excessive but sulfur from let's say a

510
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:19,240
more

511
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,600
soluble uh product like potassium

512
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:23,159
sulfate I do think can be excessive like

513
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:25,000
if I dissolve pottassium sulfate in

514
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:25,960
water and do a past test on it I I'll

515
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,319
see like

516
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:30,558
420 parts per million of sulfur which I

517
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:32,759
think is too high but from Gypsum

518
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:35,359
specifically I don't think uh excess

519
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:36,879
sulfur is an issue that brought up a

520
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:38,879
good point so when we're talking about

521
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,640
runoff I do think when we're a lot of

522
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,600
even living soil Growers when we're in

523
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:46,480
containers at the you know smaller

524
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:49,038
stages of growth it's it's impossible

525
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,919
not to have runoff so we are leeching at

526
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:53,079
some point so that's where I think maybe

527
00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:54,640
in veg having some granular gypsum in

528
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:55,720
there might be a useful way to just make

529
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,240
sure that it's breaking down a little

530
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,960
bit slower than the powder gypsum I

531
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:00,120
think that's an interesting

532
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,720
point that you brought yeah just it's

533
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:06,479
just Less Mobile in those little pellets

534
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:08,640
in regards to sulfur though so I've

535
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:11,400
always thought of sulfur I mean critical

536
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:14,600
for for turpine development um a lot of

537
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:17,320
different plant processes but

538
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:20,319
um not really something that I've seen

539
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:22,879
like a a sulfur toxicity in cannabis per

540
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:25,798
se but really the risk is just osmotic

541
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:28,400
shock the or you know osmotic pressure

542
00:22:25,798 --> 00:22:29,359
in the soil due to Salt stress so all of

543
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,759
these things that we're talking about

544
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:34,439
are quotee unquote salts and the more of

545
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:37,119
them that are in the soil uh the higher

546
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:39,038
the salt level of the soil is um is

547
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:40,479
there other things like you mentioned

548
00:22:39,038 --> 00:22:42,879
the issue of it with like potassium

549
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:45,278
sulfate what is it about the sulfur and

550
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:47,720
potassium sulfate versus gypsum that you

551
00:22:45,278 --> 00:22:51,919
see you know causing more

552
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:55,000
issues so the the only difference is the

553
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:56,679
if the if you drop potassium sulfate in

554
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
or in the soil solution if you apply to

555
00:22:56,679 --> 00:23:02,759
the soil and you water it it'll dissolve

556
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,278
up to over 400 grams per gallon of water

557
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:06,240
compared to gypsum which is only like

558
00:23:04,278 --> 00:23:08,359
eight or nine grams per gallon of water

559
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,919
so the solubility of that potassium

560
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:12,479
sulfate molecule is just so much higher

561
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:14,960
than the calcium sulfate molecule that

562
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,640
it'll release more ions into the

563
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:20,360
solution the the sulfur is the same I

564
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:22,440
mean it's the it's the same thing um but

565
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:25,439
you just get such a higher concentration

566
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:27,120
of it that the EC the soluble salts the

567
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,558
osmotic stress those are all somewhat

568
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:31,199
synonymous

569
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:33,918
that's just way way higher um with a

570
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:37,038
with a fertilizer that's more

571
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:38,679
soluble okay that makes sense yeah but

572
00:23:37,038 --> 00:23:40,480
but in general from if if we're just

573
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:42,120
focusing on gypsum no I don't think I

574
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,440
mean that your soil solution will go to

575
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:48,000
maybe 100 or 120 PPM of of soluble

576
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:50,440
sulfur and that's almost never an issue

577
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:54,159
I think I you will see the sulfur on a

578
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:55,960
tissue test be it toward the high end of

579
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:57,919
the sufficiency range or even out of the

580
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:59,319
sufficiency range but I don't think

581
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:03,120
think there's any issue with that

582
00:23:59,319 --> 00:24:06,480
there's no antagonisms with other annion

583
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:10,439
um you know I guess we're getting into

584
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:12,558
more of the realm of anecdotes here but

585
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:15,278
some Growers well there's two there's

586
00:24:12,558 --> 00:24:17,558
two things that I've heard from Growers

587
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:20,640
one of them is a myth in my opinion and

588
00:24:17,558 --> 00:24:23,639
that's that sulfur levels like that are

589
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,840
uh kill soil biology and I just don't

590
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:29,278
think there's any evidence of that I

591
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:33,199
mean soil soil microbes need sulfur

592
00:24:29,278 --> 00:24:35,880
um and there are certain populations or

593
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,640
certain species that actually prefer

594
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:40,120
high sulfur environments you may you'll

595
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:42,520
see a shift in the in the population

596
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:46,079
profile like you will with any

597
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:48,359
management action that you take um but

598
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:50,278
it definitely doesn't kill microbes I

599
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:52,199
think that comes from the idea that

600
00:24:50,278 --> 00:24:54,319
there are a lot of fungicides in organic

601
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,798
production that contains sulfur so

602
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:57,759
something called the Bordeaux mixture or

603
00:24:55,798 --> 00:24:59,918
lime sulfur like it's a it's a great

604
00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:03,079
fungicide when topically applied to the

605
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:05,520
leaves but it's in a totally different

606
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:09,158
it's completely different chemistry in

607
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:12,398
those products versus sulfur in the soil

608
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:15,679
um and at 100 PPM it's not toxic it's

609
00:25:12,398 --> 00:25:17,199
not costic it's not I don't understand

610
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:21,038
the functional mechanism in which it

611
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:23,480
would kill microbes and uh I you still

612
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:25,240
see microbial action I don't have a

613
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:29,038
microscope I don't use a microscope but

614
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:31,319
you the microbes are clearly thriving

615
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:33,319
based on a number of other metrics when

616
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:35,200
you use a lot of gypson so I do not

617
00:25:33,319 --> 00:25:38,879
believe that the other thing is smoke

618
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:42,080
quality um you know people have told me

619
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:44,240
that um you know there's this ash color

620
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:46,000
debate I think Brandon when you had

621
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:49,839
Brandon on I think he addressed this

622
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,720
very well but I I and I I did go down

623
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:54,798
this rabbit hole for a while like is

624
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:59,679
sulfur affecting Ash color

625
00:25:54,798 --> 00:25:59,679
and my conclusion is

626
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:06,120
is I'm not 100% confident with the ash

627
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:09,079
color debate but I'm pretty confident

628
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:11,038
that it doesn't um so I wouldn't call

629
00:26:09,079 --> 00:26:13,079
that a myth because I'm not in I I I

630
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:15,519
still think I'm still unclear on the

631
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:18,079
mineral the the contribution of minerals

632
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:20,720
to Ash color but I can very confidently

633
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:24,240
say that the primary determinant of Ash

634
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:26,798
color is in is incomplete combustion of

635
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,919
or of carbon-based molecules of organic

636
00:26:26,798 --> 00:26:30,278
compounds and this is what Brandon

637
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:32,759
addressed really well so that's that's

638
00:26:30,278 --> 00:26:34,519
the number one thing and I think it's it

639
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:37,079
it's very likely that that's the only

640
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:38,519
thing um but Growers have come to me a

641
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:40,398
lot with say look at my sulfur this is

642
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:41,599
going to affect my my ash color and I

643
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:44,199
don't think that's

644
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:48,678
accurate

645
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:51,880
H I have nothing to add to that yeah so

646
00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:54,679
uh okay I feel like we covered gypsum um

647
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:56,840
obviously there's other forms of calcium

648
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:59,679
that we can we can get into the plant or

649
00:26:56,839 --> 00:27:02,839
into the soil or foler um do you want to

650
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:04,360
talk a little bit about uh lime Dolomite

651
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:05,798
and then mastan night I think are the

652
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:07,278
big three let me just pitch I don't want

653
00:27:05,798 --> 00:27:08,879
to talk about lime or Dolomite but I

654
00:27:07,278 --> 00:27:12,839
want to pitch W last

655
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:15,120
Tonite as for two reasons one is it's

656
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:16,720
the least expensive source of silica and

657
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:18,398
I think most cannabis Growers understand

658
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,919
that silica can be highly beneficial for

659
00:27:18,398 --> 00:27:23,839
a number of reasons and there aren't a

660
00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:25,720
lot of organic options and the options

661
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:27,079
tend to be expensive except willaston

662
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,839
night well laston night is very

663
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:31,038
inexpensive expensive and it's a great

664
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:33,119
way if your pH is just a little bit low

665
00:27:31,038 --> 00:27:34,720
to increase the ph and provide a bunch

666
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:40,119
of really inexpensive silica to your

667
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:41,960
soil plant available um it also has a

668
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:44,518
slower I think what's called a

669
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:46,558
disillusion rate than lime so there's if

670
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:48,519
you have downward pressure on your soil

671
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:51,200
PH from your water or from Pete

672
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:53,960
mineralizing or from organic acids or

673
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:56,519
whatever once that acidity eats through

674
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:58,640
lime if lime is the

675
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:01,679
only pH

676
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:04,360
buffering uh molecule in the soil it you

677
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:07,919
can get a very sharp decline a very a

678
00:28:04,359 --> 00:28:10,398
very sharp and fast rapid rate of pH

679
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:12,559
drop in your soil things like oyster

680
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:13,959
shell and will last tonight have a bit

681
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:15,960
more buffering capacity it's a bit

682
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:20,038
slower so you're not going to see as as

683
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:21,278
aggressive of a of a pH drop um so I

684
00:28:20,038 --> 00:28:23,519
mean if you're checking your pH if

685
00:28:21,278 --> 00:28:25,519
you're soil testing it doesn't really

686
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:27,720
matter you can just keep adding lime but

687
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:29,759
I thought I like w asite because it's it

688
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:32,798
in theory is that that drop isn't going

689
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:37,679
to happen as as fast once the acidity

690
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:40,319
neutralizes all those um alkaline

691
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:43,038
molecules that answers a puzzle for me

692
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:45,759
because I've seen soil tests where they

693
00:28:43,038 --> 00:28:48,480
test you know beginning cycle mid cycle

694
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:50,599
and the pH you know being logarithmic I

695
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:53,599
wouldn't have expected it to drop as

696
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:56,119
quickly as it did given can drop like a

697
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:58,000
rock yeah what they've told me and

698
00:28:56,119 --> 00:29:00,079
that's always puzzled me on I've seen it

699
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,240
a few times now so you're saying that's

700
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:05,798
all due to them the the microbes or the

701
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:07,599
plant utilizing the alkalinity of the

702
00:29:05,798 --> 00:29:09,200
lime and then there's just nothing yeah

703
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:10,759
so once it chews through all that lime

704
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,360
it's it's sort of like if you dump

705
00:29:10,759 --> 00:29:15,240
vinegar on

706
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:16,918
Lime you know it fizzes and Bubbles and

707
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:18,640
does the little volcano thing well

708
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:20,600
eventually you know if you keep pouring

709
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,440
vinegar on it it eats through all that

710
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:25,359
lime and it stops bubbling like the lime

711
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:28,080
doesn't it it it neutralizes all of it

712
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:30,079
and it it there's nothing left to buffer

713
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:32,359
the soil now compost helps and other

714
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:35,798
things help because they're also have

715
00:29:32,359 --> 00:29:37,639
buffering capacity so in a in a you know

716
00:29:35,798 --> 00:29:38,960
I wouldn't expect to see that pH drop in

717
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:42,720
your soil for example because there's

718
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:46,720
just a lot of um organic compounds in

719
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:48,600
there but eventually it could happen um

720
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:54,079
it'd be more I would expect it more in

721
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:57,879
like a like closer to just a a

722
00:29:54,079 --> 00:30:01,079
non compost-based media like a Coco

723
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:03,159
perlite mix with Dolomite or whatever

724
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:05,398
yeah like a Prix for sure in a promix I

725
00:30:03,159 --> 00:30:07,278
think you can see a sharp drop um so

726
00:30:05,398 --> 00:30:09,798
there is more I do I do agree there's

727
00:30:07,278 --> 00:30:12,398
more buffering capacity in living soils

728
00:30:09,798 --> 00:30:15,158
um but I disagree that you don't have to

729
00:30:12,398 --> 00:30:16,839
worry about pH in living soils I think I

730
00:30:15,159 --> 00:30:19,399
think you oh let's talk about it let's

731
00:30:16,839 --> 00:30:24,119
dive into that because I love this topic

732
00:30:19,398 --> 00:30:25,879
um I I think that's so critical so yeah

733
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:27,719
and I know we've talked about this and I

734
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:30,000
want to hear your Spiel cuz my big thing

735
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:32,278
is yes living soil has buffering

736
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,519
capacity microbes are amazing people and

737
00:30:32,278 --> 00:30:37,079
that's what people rely on but if we can

738
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:39,240
get pH into an optimal range so the

739
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:41,240
plant isn't putting you know wasting

740
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:43,359
photosynthetic energy that's creating on

741
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:45,278
just getting getting the nutrients that

742
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:49,199
wants out of the soil like why wouldn't

743
00:30:45,278 --> 00:30:53,038
we adjust the pH like I I've never to

744
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:55,880
people who say to for people who say pH

745
00:30:53,038 --> 00:30:59,679
doesn't matter in a living soil okay I

746
00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:02,080
dare you to run your soil at

747
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:04,440
5.0 in a living soil and see what

748
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:07,720
happens I mean it's just not it's not

749
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:11,000
good plant Health plant Health declines

750
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:14,200
quickly at really low phes I've seen it

751
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,558
so many times um now here's the here's

752
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,278
the argument you hear really though

753
00:31:15,558 --> 00:31:19,398
Briant and this is and and I know you'll

754
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:23,519
be able to speak to this it's like I've

755
00:31:19,398 --> 00:31:26,439
never phed my soil my but my water is 85

756
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:27,880
or my water is eight or I use rainwater

757
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:29,798
well

758
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:31,600
yeah my second point to to what I was is

759
00:31:29,798 --> 00:31:33,918
going to say to the we run your soil at

760
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:36,599
5.0 well that's kind of hard to create a

761
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:39,159
5.0 PH soil in a living soil because

762
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:40,759
there's we put so much into these soils

763
00:31:39,159 --> 00:31:43,360
and most of these things we put in

764
00:31:40,759 --> 00:31:45,679
specifically compost um but also all the

765
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:48,839
organic amendments soft rock phosphate

766
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:50,159
crustation meal lime massin all of those

767
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:52,398
things are putting upward pressure on

768
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:55,320
the phach so usually after you mix a

769
00:31:52,398 --> 00:31:58,398
soil blend it's going to land you know

770
00:31:55,319 --> 00:32:02,319
in a higher pH range not always but

771
00:31:58,398 --> 00:32:03,839
often um so so then a grower runs their

772
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:05,439
soil they have great success and they

773
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:07,038
say I've never phed my soil well it

774
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,480
started with a good pH it started with a

775
00:32:07,038 --> 00:32:11,720
high pH and you you continue adding

776
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:15,399
amendments and composts that put upward

777
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:17,720
pressure on the ph and or water in in

778
00:32:15,398 --> 00:32:19,239
your example so maybe you have a high pH

779
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:21,600
water that's putting constant upward

780
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:22,720
pressure on your on your media pH and so

781
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:24,719
you yeah you don't have to worry about

782
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:27,839
it but that's not be that's not I I

783
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:30,159
think the the mistake people make is is

784
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:32,638
creating a universal statement like you

785
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:37,120
don't have to worry about pH because

786
00:32:32,638 --> 00:32:40,398
it's a living soil that is inaccurate

787
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:42,518
technically that's just not a it's it's

788
00:32:40,398 --> 00:32:44,798
it's it'd be more accurate to say a lot

789
00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:47,120
of living soils or a lot of PE based

790
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:49,638
Medias you don't have to worry about pH

791
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:51,359
but to say because it's a living soil or

792
00:32:49,638 --> 00:32:54,000
all living soils you don't have to worry

793
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:56,038
about it is is not true and I've seen so

794
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,240
many soil tests and I've seen so many

795
00:32:56,038 --> 00:33:00,638
issues that I can I'm just 100%

796
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:03,399
confident with

797
00:33:00,638 --> 00:33:06,240
that yeah so I the point I was getting

798
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:08,638
as like um I more probably more like I

799
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:11,798
don't have to pH my water

800
00:33:08,638 --> 00:33:15,959
because I have a living soil and my

801
00:33:11,798 --> 00:33:19,240
water is an eight but I think you know

802
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:21,558
why that might be okay

803
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:23,480
um do you want to just touch on that I

804
00:33:21,558 --> 00:33:24,638
mean this we're getting off topic but

805
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:26,679
but this is great I think it's

806
00:33:24,638 --> 00:33:31,000
interesting and sorry I interrupted you

807
00:33:26,679 --> 00:33:33,360
I just was eager no no please jump in um

808
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,798
so with it when it comes to phing water

809
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:36,439
same thing to say you don't have to pH

810
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:37,638
water with a living soil is not

811
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:40,200
sometimes it's accurate sometimes it's

812
00:33:37,638 --> 00:33:42,319
not so what's confusing about water is

813
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:46,558
you can have a water with a pH of let's

814
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:49,720
say 7.5 that doesn't need to be

815
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:52,359
phed you can have a water with a pH of a

816
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:55,240
different water with a pH of 7.5 that I

817
00:33:52,359 --> 00:34:00,359
would argue should be

818
00:33:55,240 --> 00:34:03,839
phed and so what why that's confusing is

819
00:34:00,359 --> 00:34:06,519
because um I always stumble on

820
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:09,878
explaining this there

821
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:13,679
are it depends on the

822
00:34:09,878 --> 00:34:16,559
the total um

823
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:18,838
molecules in that water that are that

824
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:23,119
measured best by a term called

825
00:34:18,838 --> 00:34:25,799
alkalinity which is not pH it's how much

826
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:27,480
acid would it require to lower the pH of

827
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:31,159
that water

828
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:33,559
and so in water number one it may have

829
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:36,679
an alkalinity of 50 PPM and it just

830
00:34:33,559 --> 00:34:39,918
takes a tiny little drop of citric acid

831
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:42,200
and the pH drops like a rock the same

832
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:46,679
water with a pH water number two with

833
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:50,158
the same pH of 75 it might take a lot of

834
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:52,200
acid to drop the pH because the the

835
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:54,800
there's just way more hydroxides or

836
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:57,598
bicarbonate in water number two so water

837
00:34:54,800 --> 00:35:00,440
number one the the soil will buffer that

838
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:02,720
pH it the the the water is going to

839
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:04,200
reflect the soil PH very quickly because

840
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:07,519
there's just not a lot of alkaline

841
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:10,039
molecules in that water water number

842
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:14,320
two requires so

843
00:35:10,039 --> 00:35:16,599
much acid to neutralize those alkaline

844
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:18,240
molecules that when it hits the water

845
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:20,160
the the soil solution is going to

846
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:21,679
reflect the water PH it's not going to

847
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:24,199
the soil is not going to buffer that

848
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:26,319
very well so that's what's confusing is

849
00:35:24,199 --> 00:35:29,239
people take the pH of their water and

850
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:31,480
they think that either need to to pH it

851
00:35:29,239 --> 00:35:34,559
or they don't need to pH it but but you

852
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:36,199
actually don't know just based on the pH

853
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:38,639
you have to get a water test and look at

854
00:35:36,199 --> 00:35:41,559
the alkalinity and I usually think when

855
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:43,879
the alkalinity is over 120 PPM that's a

856
00:35:41,559 --> 00:35:45,639
good time to consider pH in your water

857
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:47,200
if you're trying to optimize if you're

858
00:35:45,639 --> 00:35:49,838
trying to grow a perfectly healthy crop

859
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:52,118
you don't need to but if you want to

860
00:35:49,838 --> 00:35:54,279
optimize I think you should once it gets

861
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:55,880
up to let's say 180 I think it's

862
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:57,480
critical I think over time if you're

863
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:59,559
running your soil over and over again

864
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:02,358
you're living soil over let's say 10

865
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:02,358
Rounds you're going to see

866
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:07,800
issues yeah you you said it perfectly

867
00:36:06,318 --> 00:36:09,400
and I think that's the thing that we see

868
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,880
in forums is where people are like oh

869
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:13,280
you know throw away your pH pen I don't

870
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,760
need it anymore because I switch to

871
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,480
living soil I just want people to pump

872
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:19,880
the brakes a little little bit and say

873
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:22,519
okay I may not need it quite as much

874
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:25,400
because yes the microbes in the soil

875
00:36:22,519 --> 00:36:26,920
will help buffer the pH all the organic

876
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:29,160
amendments that we're adding to compost

877
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:33,280
all of this creates a a very complex

878
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:35,920
Solution that's better at buffering but

879
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,599
there are circumstances and you see them

880
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,920
I see them because we see soil tests

881
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:42,359
from all over the country um even

882
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:44,720
internationally sometimes and things

883
00:36:42,358 --> 00:36:48,920
don't you know not everyone has access

884
00:36:44,719 --> 00:36:51,559
to clean water exactly yeah if you I

885
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:54,559
would love to send that grower a 275

886
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:57,400
gallon tote of well water from Arizona

887
00:36:54,559 --> 00:37:01,000
with 100 parts per million of sodium and

888
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:03,119
350 PPM of alkalinity and a pH of 8.4

889
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,318
it's it's that's a that's a different

890
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:09,079
situation um and obviously that's an

891
00:37:05,318 --> 00:37:11,679
extreme example but see universals are

892
00:37:09,079 --> 00:37:15,079
dangerous yeah I go to Oklahoma in my

893
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:16,440
brain but uh anywhere arid anywhere Aid

894
00:37:15,079 --> 00:37:18,318
when you drill a well in an aid

895
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:22,920
environment you're G to get something

896
00:37:18,318 --> 00:37:25,920
weird yeah now the reverse can be true

897
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:27,920
with in a in usually in a wet

898
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,200
environment

899
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:32,639
sometimes you can have super acidic

900
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:36,118
water much more rare in my opinion but

901
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:39,078
you could have acidic water the solution

902
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:41,039
to that's way easier you can just lme

903
00:37:39,079 --> 00:37:41,960
your soil or maybe W last night or

904
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:45,599
oyster

905
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:48,519
shell you can push the soil PH a little

906
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:50,680
higher than you would normally and then

907
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:53,960
that acidic water combines with the high

908
00:37:50,679 --> 00:37:58,000
pH um soil and it creates a nice soil

909
00:37:53,960 --> 00:38:00,280
solution pH um so you don't necessarily

910
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:03,800
I mean or you could ph up your water but

911
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:05,280
that that term pH Up usually implies

912
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,599
that you're going to add a liquid

913
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:10,720
bottled

914
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:13,240
potassium carbonate potassium

915
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:14,639
hydroxide sometimes not organic and it's

916
00:38:13,239 --> 00:38:17,639
just and then you're just putting

917
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:19,759
potassium in your system to increase the

918
00:38:17,639 --> 00:38:22,879
pH it's far better in my opinion because

919
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:26,800
I'm I'm way more interested in pushing

920
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:29,440
calcium is to just add a a alkaline

921
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:32,560
calcium soil amendment and and buffer

922
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:35,159
the pH through the soil and not ph up

923
00:38:32,559 --> 00:38:38,960
your water with some liquid

924
00:38:35,159 --> 00:38:41,399
bottle so you talk about W asite and

925
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:43,838
oyster shell together they're obviously

926
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:47,079
quite different oyster shell being

927
00:38:43,838 --> 00:38:49,639
primarily Cal calcium carbonate and O in

928
00:38:47,079 --> 00:38:51,280
well last night being calcium silicate

929
00:38:49,639 --> 00:38:53,078
um one thing I want to point out is

930
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:56,800
calcium silicate doesn't move the pH

931
00:38:53,079 --> 00:38:59,318
needle as quickly as lime will and it's

932
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:01,240
not as effective per unit of of of

933
00:38:59,318 --> 00:39:03,960
amendment either like lime will increase

934
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:05,598
the pH more every cup of lime will

935
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:07,039
increase it more than a couple of last

936
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:08,720
night sorry I interrupted again keep

937
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:09,800
going yeah no that's great yeah so it's

938
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:13,000
it doesn't move the needles quickly so

939
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:15,400
if you need to raise your pH quickly uh

940
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:18,599
between Cycles then you want to consider

941
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:21,880
consider lime or oyster shell though

942
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:25,160
I've always considered oyster shell and

943
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:28,240
Lime In My Head the same thing because

944
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:30,318
they're both 90 9% calcium carbonate or

945
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:31,799
whatever yeah with the oyster shell

946
00:39:30,318 --> 00:39:34,199
maybe having a little more impurities

947
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:36,920
and then I've just looked at it by in in

948
00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:38,480
regards to particle size so it's

949
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:42,200
interesting to me that you're

950
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:44,318
differentiating oyster shell from lime

951
00:39:42,199 --> 00:39:46,598
no I think I think you're right I think

952
00:39:44,318 --> 00:39:48,358
I I when you say that I think I actually

953
00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:50,000
think you're right and I I agree I think

954
00:39:48,358 --> 00:39:53,000
it's just that oyster shell is more

955
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:55,400
coarse so maybe that's not the right way

956
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,800
to frame it I think that the the rate is

957
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:59,800
still slower for sure but it's probably

958
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:04,119
due to particle size like you said the

959
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:05,839
coarseness of the the material um

960
00:40:04,119 --> 00:40:07,838
although it's an interesting point I I'd

961
00:40:05,838 --> 00:40:09,159
have to think about that more but I

962
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:10,920
think you're right and say same with

963
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:12,519
aragonite people always mention

964
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:15,440
aragonite to me and I looked it up and

965
00:40:12,519 --> 00:40:17,119
it's just calcium carbonate so I I do I

966
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,480
do agree that those three products

967
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:20,400
should probably just be clustered in the

968
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:23,800
same category because they're all

969
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:27,838
calcium carbonate when vassin is is a

970
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:29,760
completely different molecule so hm okay

971
00:40:27,838 --> 00:40:32,400
yeah one thing speaking of calcium that

972
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:35,040
I thought was interesting is relating to

973
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:37,519
eggshells and the use use of crushed

974
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:41,599
eggshells I wasn't aware of how

975
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:43,800
unavailable that calcium was due to

976
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:45,880
something that the chicken coats it with

977
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:48,920
that makes it less it just doesn't break

978
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:52,240
down very quickly even when you crush it

979
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:54,519
more um have you read anything about

980
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:57,799
that I haven't read anything about it

981
00:40:54,519 --> 00:41:03,199
but I have some experience with with um

982
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:05,400
some it's a very common jadam input and

983
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:08,919
um in jadam you

984
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:10,639
take apple cider vinegar 10 parts apple

985
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:11,960
cider vinegar one part eggshells you

986
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:13,400
crush the eggshells up you leave them in

987
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:15,199
the jar of apple ceter vinegar for

988
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:17,280
months and months and months and I've

989
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:19,960
seen tests on that I've gotten really

990
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:24,200
into testing all these different knf and

991
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:26,838
jadam inputs and um unfortunately that

992
00:41:24,199 --> 00:41:30,358
the it's called WCA the the calcium

993
00:41:26,838 --> 00:41:32,719
levels that I've seen were super low but

994
00:41:30,358 --> 00:41:36,480
I'm still struggling with this WCA test

995
00:41:32,719 --> 00:41:39,239
to know the dilution of the WCA to water

996
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:41,519
but even at the recommended dilution

997
00:41:39,239 --> 00:41:44,959
rate um which is I think a teaspoon per

998
00:41:41,519 --> 00:41:47,440
gallon of water the the ppms were too

999
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:49,400
low in my opinion way too low so even

1000
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:52,200
after sitting in apple cider vinegar for

1001
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:54,358
months and months and months very little

1002
00:41:52,199 --> 00:41:57,118
calcium was liberated from those

1003
00:41:54,358 --> 00:42:00,279
eggshells or or or there just weren't

1004
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:03,838
enough eggshells and I'm not a huge I

1005
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:07,440
mean right next to the WCA

1006
00:42:03,838 --> 00:42:11,199
uh uh recipe in the jadam book is quick

1007
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:13,358
lime or no sorry quick oyster shell WCA

1008
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:16,118
I'm way more interested in that and the

1009
00:42:13,358 --> 00:42:18,400
results I've seen is that the the parts

1010
00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:21,079
per million of calcium are far higher

1011
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:24,000
from vinegar and oyster shell flow than

1012
00:42:21,079 --> 00:42:26,280
it is from eggshells so no I don't I

1013
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,280
don't promote or really I'm not really

1014
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:31,599
drawn to using eggshells at all a

1015
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:32,920
because it seems totally insoluble and B

1016
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:35,440
because it just doesn't seem like they

1017
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:37,440
contribute that much calcium um compared

1018
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:39,639
to these other things we're talking

1019
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:41,200
about yeah they've done some DEC

1020
00:42:39,639 --> 00:42:43,598
composition studies on it and they just

1021
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:44,759
found it doesn't break down as quickly

1022
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:46,079
as you would think it's not a period of

1023
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:47,960
weeks to months it's like a period of

1024
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:49,760
years in a lot of cases in terms of that

1025
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:50,800
calcium being liberated I have to go

1026
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,400
back and read more but I thought that

1027
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,720
was interesting well and especially I

1028
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,358
mean that's an apple cider vinegar

1029
00:42:53,719 --> 00:42:58,679
imagine in a in a in a compost or a soil

1030
00:42:56,358 --> 00:43:00,519
where the pH is seven it's where they

1031
00:42:58,679 --> 00:43:02,480
they tested it in soil yeah oh yeah

1032
00:43:00,519 --> 00:43:04,800
it'll take dead it'll take yeah it's

1033
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:10,599
like yeah it'll take decades I mean the

1034
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:13,680
solubility of oyster shell and soft rock

1035
00:43:10,599 --> 00:43:15,640
phosphate and a lot of these a lot of

1036
00:43:13,679 --> 00:43:17,440
these products that need microbial

1037
00:43:15,639 --> 00:43:19,879
decomposition and weathering which is

1038
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:21,800
non non-microbial sometimes the

1039
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:24,200
difference there is wild when it comes

1040
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:25,880
to pH pH is a way bigger driver of

1041
00:43:24,199 --> 00:43:29,039
decomposition of those types of things

1042
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:30,760
than microbial activity oftentimes so I

1043
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:32,679
don't recommend softrock phosphate when

1044
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:36,040
the soil pH is high because it'll take

1045
00:43:32,679 --> 00:43:39,679
so long um to actually release compared

1046
00:43:36,039 --> 00:43:42,558
to when the pH is 5.5 it's it's a it's a

1047
00:43:39,679 --> 00:43:44,719
wild difference in the

1048
00:43:42,559 --> 00:43:47,400
rate I want to point out that oyster

1049
00:43:44,719 --> 00:43:50,318
shell flour is typically a mind product

1050
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:52,039
too people in their brains think oh I

1051
00:43:50,318 --> 00:43:53,480
want to get oyster shell flour because

1052
00:43:52,039 --> 00:43:56,400
it's more sustainable or it's more

1053
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:57,960
organic um than lime but but really

1054
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,720
they're both mined products one's just

1055
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:02,358
being mined from old Marine deposits and

1056
00:43:59,719 --> 00:44:06,399
the other's being mined from you know a

1057
00:44:02,358 --> 00:44:08,519
lime deposit so um I didn't know that

1058
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:10,200
yeah yeah so sometimes I think the way

1059
00:44:08,519 --> 00:44:11,880
we think about trying to be more

1060
00:44:10,199 --> 00:44:13,799
sustainable or more organic or avoid

1061
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:18,680
things for whatever ethical reasons it's

1062
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:21,160
a little more complicated um we realize

1063
00:44:18,679 --> 00:44:24,279
always so anything else on calcium

1064
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:26,598
before we move on to another another uh

1065
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:28,680
topic no I I

1066
00:44:26,599 --> 00:44:31,359
nothing on my

1067
00:44:28,679 --> 00:44:33,118
