responsible practices within the

43
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:40,859
Cannabis industry now on to the show

44
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,540
all right well let's uh let's talk cover

45
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:44,819
crops you brought him up

46
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:48,200
um you're a big proponent there's very

47
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:50,819
few commercial facilities that I see

48
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,920
successfully running cover crops indoors

49
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:54,779
and showing it online

50
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,879
um I have a lot of guys I've worked with

51
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,659
that have tried it and failed

52
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:59,879
um

53
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:01,560
I'm not a huge proponent of cover crops

54
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:03,780
indoors not because I don't think they

55
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,340
have some benefits but for me the cons

56
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,140
outweigh the pros but let's talk about

57
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,580
what those pros and cons are and why it

58
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:12,000
works so well for you and your facility

59
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:14,340
so I'll let you start yeah um first off

60
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,560
uh if you plan on using cover crops

61
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:18,360
listen to everything Tad says uh because

62
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,120
if you don't you're gonna make him right

63
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,160
okay because everything he says has a p

64
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,159
has a point he's not he's not making

65
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:27,598
stuff up it's not it's a very um you

66
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:29,340
walk a thin line when rubbing cover

67
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:31,738
crops and doors and cover crops in

68
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,939
general I'm going plants in general

69
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:34,378
um so I think there's definitely some

70
00:02:32,939 --> 00:02:36,239
people who kind of overdo it they have

71
00:02:34,378 --> 00:02:38,039
too much fun with it and they create

72
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,439
more work and responsibility than it is

73
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:42,840
intended uh so like we've run a very

74
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:44,280
basic cover crop um and I do mix it up

75
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,280
from time to time based off of what

76
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:49,259
we're facing both indoors and Outdoors

77
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,300
um but for the most part I see the

78
00:02:49,259 --> 00:02:52,199
benefit of it uh it's against it's not a

79
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,099
perfect

80
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:54,479
um process

81
00:02:53,098 --> 00:02:57,179
um but you know nothing in farming is

82
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:59,219
perfect uh the benefits that we find

83
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:01,439
from it and I feel like it creates a

84
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:03,300
shelter this living mulch crisis shelter

85
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:04,979
over my soil that keeps my soil

86
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,780
organisms where they're supposed to be

87
00:03:04,979 --> 00:03:08,818
in the soil and keep things from just

88
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,500
blowing up all over my plants I really

89
00:03:08,818 --> 00:03:12,238
do that's a huge component in the cover

90
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,818
crop obviously

91
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,680
um we spend a lot of money on light you

92
00:03:14,818 --> 00:03:18,719
know so in early in days my cannabis

93
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,459
plants aren't catching all that light if

94
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:22,199
I let it hit that soil I'm just wasting

95
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:23,939
energy so I like the idea of you know

96
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:25,378
cover crops and catching that light and

97
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:27,658
photosynthesizing and turning into

98
00:03:25,378 --> 00:03:29,818
energy that my soil and plants can use

99
00:03:27,658 --> 00:03:30,900
further at a further date

100
00:03:29,818 --> 00:03:32,399
um so I think a little bit efficiency

101
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,239
there is a juice worth the squeeze I

102
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,920
don't know

103
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:37,200
um but uh

104
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:38,939
for the most part is it's just one thing

105
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:41,158
I use I've used a part of my IPM program

106
00:03:38,939 --> 00:03:42,900
so I'll plan specific cover crops to

107
00:03:41,158 --> 00:03:44,818
attract pests I'll plant cover crops to

108
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,739
a Repel pest like we had a rat issue

109
00:03:44,818 --> 00:03:48,359
real bad one time you're the rat or like

110
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:49,980
two years ago

111
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,739
um yeah the year they're bad and it hit

112
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:54,780
this whole town hardcore uh and got some

113
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:57,539
rats and I'm starting to noticing some

114
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,919
um um Predator packs would get destroyed

115
00:03:57,539 --> 00:04:00,780
um we get eaten

116
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:03,298
um so we quickly started doing some

117
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:05,158
research and in my mind the way it works

118
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:06,959
what's the natural predator for cat for

119
00:04:05,158 --> 00:04:08,340
a rats so we got a cat and put it to the

120
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,920
cat next door

121
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:13,319
um got some uh in our warehouse and then

122
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:16,019
uh we probably mince in our bed so I I

123
00:04:13,318 --> 00:04:18,238
blew out my whole beds with mints

124
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:19,739
um and the Rats never came back uh never

125
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,179
seen after men's took over our beds

126
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:22,379
we've never seen a single rat in this

127
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:24,840
facility

128
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:26,459
um but then I let the mint get too far

129
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:28,859
um didn't cool them in time and that

130
00:04:26,459 --> 00:04:30,418
shit's super invasive uh and you had to

131
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:32,400
pull a bunch of mint out so now I had to

132
00:04:30,418 --> 00:04:34,680
learn how to better manage that mint it

133
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:36,839
was good for one thing but the double-ed

134
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,699
sword it turned around and it kind of

135
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:40,439
bit me in the butt on the other side so

136
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:42,000
um if you are going to use a can a cover

137
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:45,120
crops I recommend

138
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,040
picking with like one basic variety with

139
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,840
like a dicondra start with that that's

140
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,919
your blanket cover crop it doesn't

141
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:51,599
really serve a whole lot of purposes

142
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:53,039
other than just covering the soil all

143
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,439
right and then I started to add other

144
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,000
little things have a reason for it uh

145
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:59,100
and then have a place for it like you

146
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,300
can't judge a face by how well it climb

147
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,259
the tree

148
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,639
um because you have it in the wrong

149
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,900
place put it in the water then see how

150
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,300
well it swims then make your judgment

151
00:05:03,899 --> 00:05:07,859
you know um so I feel like if you have a

152
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,900
purpose for these cover crop or these

153
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:11,040
companion plants and you put them in the

154
00:05:09,899 --> 00:05:12,599
right place

155
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,460
um then they can add value to the system

156
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,680
but if you're just going in there and

157
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:18,779
throwing seeds doing the little salt

158
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,459
dusting uh and just having this

159
00:05:18,779 --> 00:05:22,739
beautiful Lush cover crops and flowers

160
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:24,599
everywhere yeah it looks good for IG

161
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:26,220
don't get me wrong some of my most high

162
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,240
tracks and pictures are ones of miracles

163
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:29,580
in it

164
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,379
um but in the day you're you're creating

165
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:33,418
more work than you want the whole idea

166
00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:35,279
of creating these systems is to create

167
00:05:33,418 --> 00:05:36,839
systems that manage themselves like

168
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:38,459
that's why I love worms because if I

169
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:40,679
were to pay somebody to do a worms job

170
00:05:38,459 --> 00:05:41,879
they wouldn't do it as good and costs a

171
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,220
whole lot more money

172
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:46,139
um so finding these systems that are

173
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:48,960
easy to manage that make life easier not

174
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:51,720
harder um it's a fine line um and we

175
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:53,819
walk it every single day

176
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,979
yeah and some of the other benefits that

177
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:58,199
you you I don't know if you touched on

178
00:05:55,978 --> 00:06:01,740
were what sort of water management

179
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:03,660
um it's going to keep that uh initial

180
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:07,860
level of the soil the first couple

181
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:10,259
inches a lot a lot more moist and by

182
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:11,520
keeping active plants in there and Roots

183
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:13,439
you're gonna you're probably getting

184
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:15,000
better nutrient cycling in that soil

185
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:16,740
before the cannabis plant really has a

186
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,319
chance to take off

187
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:22,139
um so those are some more

188
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:23,459
yeah Pros pros of cover crops I would

189
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:25,079
say I look at it as like diversity thing

190
00:06:23,459 --> 00:06:25,978
if you want more diversity diversity is

191
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:27,478
good

192
00:06:25,978 --> 00:06:29,038
um it helps to have more diverse cover

193
00:06:27,478 --> 00:06:31,079
crop or more diverse plants in the

194
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:32,839
system that doesn't attract and grow

195
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:35,758
different you know microbial communities

196
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:38,099
so I I try to have you know as many as I

197
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,960
can afford to take care of uh plants in

198
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:42,720
the system like right now we're gearing

199
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:44,099
up to to do our Marigold runs again to

200
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,380
get some flowering plants in the rooms

201
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:48,180
again in springtime every year I cut

202
00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:50,279
back and I just run at that Conjuring

203
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:51,959
wood chips minimize any potential risk

204
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:53,818
from the outside and then anything I do

205
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:55,019
with more of a trap pant so it's a trap

206
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:56,400
plant so I'll put them in the Trap plant

207
00:06:55,019 --> 00:06:58,019
in the corner of the room

208
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:00,659
um for my cover crop or for my companion

209
00:06:58,019 --> 00:07:03,839
plant that that cycle

210
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:06,000
um but yeah it's uh I think as long as

211
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:07,379
you're mulching I I'm just proponent of

212
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,538
mulching uh I think we're okay whether

213
00:07:07,379 --> 00:07:11,639
it's living mulch or or you know brown

214
00:07:09,538 --> 00:07:13,139
mulch whatever the case may be um I'm

215
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,759
just a huge proponent for covering your

216
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:16,918
soil in general

217
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:19,259
um but yeah obviously I'm a cover crop

218
00:07:16,918 --> 00:07:21,538
guy and to be clear the first time I saw

219
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:22,979
cover cops was uh my buddy Brad Thurman

220
00:07:21,538 --> 00:07:25,560
showed me Matt Davenport's Instagram

221
00:07:22,978 --> 00:07:27,180
like eight years ago and uh he has some

222
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:29,098
clovers in the bottom of his pots and I

223
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:32,038
thought it was the stupidest thing I've

224
00:07:29,098 --> 00:07:33,659
ever seen and I'll never forget this

225
00:07:32,038 --> 00:07:35,399
lazy dudes not even pulling weeds like

226
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:37,560
this is so lazy it's stealing nutrients

227
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:39,478
like all these things went off and here

228
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,220
I am eight years later kind of known for

229
00:07:39,478 --> 00:07:43,379
it so it's kind of funny

230
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:45,479
that is funny I see the first time I

231
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:48,120
thought I saw it I was like oh that's so

232
00:07:45,478 --> 00:07:49,918
cool what a great idea

233
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,959
um and then I kind of backed off and

234
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:53,879
changed my mind over time so it's we've

235
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:55,439
went opposite directions

236
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:57,000
um well I think you covered the reasons

237
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:58,199
folks would choose to use cover crops

238
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,279
really well

239
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:01,020
um

240
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:04,739
I want to give my thoughts but before I

241
00:08:01,019 --> 00:08:06,359
do uh what what cover crops will you not

242
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:08,280
use you mentioned some that you really

243
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,199
like but what would you just never use

244
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:12,659
as a cover crop besides mint

245
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:14,038
would not I use mint um I just I'll just

246
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:16,259
make sure I call it at the end of every

247
00:08:14,038 --> 00:08:18,360
cycle I won't let it grow so wild

248
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:19,560
um so the demand I still think mint has

249
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,000
a value in the system especially if

250
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,139
you're an area where there's rats or

251
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
things like that it could definitely

252
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:25,500
help out um just don't let it grow wild

253
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,019
you definitely want to chop and drop it

254
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:29,579
pull it back hold it as much as possible

255
00:08:28,019 --> 00:08:31,378
um one cover crop that I won't use

256
00:08:29,579 --> 00:08:32,699
indoors all right yeah we'll use this

257
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:34,320
out I'm about to use it Outdoors don't

258
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:36,658
use it indoors ever again

259
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,000
um it's Clover uh I think it's too much

260
00:08:36,658 --> 00:08:40,559
risk versus reward I think there's a lot

261
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,879
easier ways to get nitrogen back into

262
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,559
the system

263
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:45,419
um than attracting pests and disease

264
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:46,799
like uh like Clover does anytime I've

265
00:08:45,419 --> 00:08:49,019
ever had past outbreak

266
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:50,519
um it fed off the Clover heavily

267
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:52,440
um so we eventually called all the

268
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:54,000
Clover from all of our soils

269
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,800
um placed here with dichondra nothing

270
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,019
really likes psychonja I mean May

271
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:59,338
Ling Grande conjure a little bit but

272
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:00,839
nothing's going out of their way for

273
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:02,220
decondra

274
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:04,140
um so that's kind of been like the

275
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:05,820
ground cover that we we choose to use um

276
00:09:04,139 --> 00:09:06,838
Clover is done though

277
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:09,300
um

278
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:11,279
anything I wouldn't use oh crawling

279
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:12,539
stuff uh anything that's going to crawl

280
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:14,220
to plants

281
00:09:12,539 --> 00:09:16,319
um obviously like it's when you're

282
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:19,080
growing 500 plants you can't afford to

283
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,360
be you know pulling you know beanstalks

284
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,740
and and all these little vets and all

285
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,220
these little crazy things out of your

286
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:28,200
cannabis canopy so use things that are

287
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:29,519
definitely low laying cover crops for

288
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,360
sure

289
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,519
um

290
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:35,060
other than that I mean again time and

291
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:35,060
place for everything

292
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,539
and I will say like

293
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:41,759
I think you brought up another good

294
00:09:39,539 --> 00:09:44,039
point and that is that you know use your

295
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:45,480
cover crop with a purpose

296
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:48,778
um all cover crops have different

297
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:50,759
purposes whether that's to break up the

298
00:09:48,778 --> 00:09:53,879
soil better

299
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:56,580
um or to add nitrogen or to create more

300
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:57,899
organic matter you're going to grow a

301
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,820
different cover crop for that there's no

302
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:02,159
perfect cover crop and a lot of people

303
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:04,500
will run like multi multi-species cover

304
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:05,819
crops outdoors and I love cover crops

305
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:08,159
outdoors I think they make a ton of

306
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:10,019
sense the reasons and all this reasons

307
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:12,000
why I don't like cover crops indoors so

308
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:13,440
much and then you know Growers can make

309
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,240
their own decisions based on their own

310
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,440
facility and I don't just because

311
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,700
someone used cover crops I don't think

312
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,260
they're a bad grower that they're making

313
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:21,300
a bad decision I just think people need

314
00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:24,600
to be educated on why they do what they

315
00:10:21,299 --> 00:10:27,299
do so for me with cover crops it's it's

316
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,040
another crop that you have to manage and

317
00:10:27,299 --> 00:10:30,299
in a commercial facility that can be

318
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:31,919
problematic because you already have

319
00:10:30,299 --> 00:10:33,419
your hands full a lot of times managing

320
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:34,860
your cannabis plant your cash crop

321
00:10:33,419 --> 00:10:37,620
that's what's bringing in your revenue

322
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:38,300
and you're in business in addition to

323
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:42,959
that

324
00:10:38,299 --> 00:10:45,299
uh I really like to mix my nutrients

325
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:46,979
into the soil to get it back into the

326
00:10:45,299 --> 00:10:49,799
rhizosphere as fast as possible because

327
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:51,899
we're cropping five Cycles uh a year

328
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:54,059
we're going a little faster

329
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:55,860
um than than what you're doing at Green

330
00:10:54,059 --> 00:10:57,958
life and so

331
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:59,339
um we want to get those nutrients right

332
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:00,778
into the rhizosphere where the plant can

333
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:02,760
happen and I like a little bit of

334
00:11:00,778 --> 00:11:04,980
disturbance in my soil you mentioned

335
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:06,838
this whole idea of of cannabis being a

336
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,980
little more bacterial I don't have a

337
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:10,380
problem with a little bit of soil

338
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:11,579
disturbance I'm not tilling my beds keep

339
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:13,200
in mind you know we're not using a

340
00:11:11,578 --> 00:11:15,000
mechanical tiller we're just digging in

341
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,860
some nutrients and I think that's a very

342
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,899
different process that people don't

343
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:21,240
consider when they talk about you know

344
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:25,139
tilling versus no-till we're not tilling

345
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:28,919
indoors I think that cannabis

346
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:32,100
uh agriculture in general is artificial

347
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:35,219
we're selecting for a crop here so the

348
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:38,700
diversity that we have in you know a

349
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:40,079
given indoor space is not or even

350
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,640
Outdoors is not going to be anywhere

351
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:43,799
near the diversity that we see in a

352
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:45,958
healthy forest ecosystem or a prairie

353
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:48,539
land or something like that so

354
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:50,699
um I I like to pull what practices we

355
00:11:48,539 --> 00:11:51,958
can from nature I think Mother Nature is

356
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,459
amazing and we want to use those

357
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:57,119
practices but we want to use them

358
00:11:53,458 --> 00:12:01,078
strategically I'm not creating flood

359
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:03,600
events you know or doing you know it's

360
00:12:01,078 --> 00:12:05,039
blasting my plants with wind because a

361
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,079
tornado may occur in nature you know

362
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:09,299
these sorts of things so I just want to

363
00:12:07,078 --> 00:12:11,099
be aware that like what we're doing is

364
00:12:09,299 --> 00:12:12,719
artificial

365
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:15,540
um and we're doing it in the sense of

366
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:18,420
trying to create the best yields and the

367
00:12:15,539 --> 00:12:19,679
best uh plants that we can not just

368
00:12:18,419 --> 00:12:20,819
because of the business because we're

369
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:22,500
but also because we're growing this

370
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:24,778
plant because we love it and you know

371
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,399
it's medicine for a lot of people and

372
00:12:24,778 --> 00:12:28,620
then the last point that I have around

373
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:31,078
cover crops for me is

374
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:33,419
we're growing this indoors in controlled

375
00:12:31,078 --> 00:12:35,099
environment agriculture we can control

376
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:37,439
the environment so that's one more

377
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:39,000
variable that we have to add to this and

378
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,140
there's already so many variables in

379
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,980
cultivation

380
00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:43,319
um

381
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:45,120
I don't like the risk of the pest

382
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:47,100
pressures that it may bring in you know

383
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,440
you mentioned Clover crops my my brain

384
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:51,659
or cover crops with Clover my brain

385
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,959
immediately goes to thrips

386
00:12:51,659 --> 00:12:56,519
um like I I don't like the risk of

387
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:58,138
having that and then

388
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:01,560
um oh I thought of one other point so

389
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:04,799
last thing is hop late and viroid

390
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:09,599
I like to now pull Roots because we know

391
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:11,699
that hop latent is uh in higher viroid

392
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,500
levels are in the root system than in

393
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:15,360
the leaf tissue and we can test for that

394
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:17,458
better by testing Roots so I want to

395
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,639
pull the roots to lower the viral load

396
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:22,138
in my soil because at the end of the day

397
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,879
I'm not ready to throw this whole living

398
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:24,959
soil methodology out just because we

399
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:26,820
have

400
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:28,799
you know hop late and viroid now in our

401
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:30,360
in in most facilities and it's such a

402
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:32,458
problem in our industry so

403
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,320
all right what are your thoughts all

404
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:35,819
right well first we jump to the The Hop

405
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,620
Layton thing before I wasn't ready for

406
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,760
that one uh let's back up a little bit

407
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:40,860
though so I can tackle that one too

408
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:42,600
though um to your point though yeah if

409
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:44,639
you're trying to use cover crops the

410
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,778
whole idea is like you said we have a

411
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,639
whole lot to manage we're trying to

412
00:13:45,778 --> 00:13:48,778
manage a cash crop you have to be in

413
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:49,980
order to be your agenda if you have to

414
00:13:48,778 --> 00:13:52,799
be sustainable

415
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:54,778
um and run a good business so there is a

416
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:57,000
fine line like I said you have to walk

417
00:13:54,778 --> 00:13:59,338
um in my situation I'm literally setting

418
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,200
up the easiest self-managing cover

419
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:02,940
cropping systems a possible like when I

420
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,800
do put a banker plant or a trap plant

421
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:06,420
I'm not planting it throughout my whole

422
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:07,500
facility I'm finding in very specific

423
00:14:06,419 --> 00:14:08,819
areas

424
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,500
um like at the end the corners of our

425
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:12,899
beds while playing like marigolds so if

426
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:14,339
you look at old GOP photos start to look

427
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:16,259
at where some of our marigolds are some

428
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:18,120
of our more campaign not cover crops

429
00:14:16,259 --> 00:14:19,139
where companion plants are placed um

430
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,578
they're then placed in a high traffic

431
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:21,659
area where it's easy for us to manage

432
00:14:20,578 --> 00:14:22,979
them where it's easy for us to see if

433
00:14:21,659 --> 00:14:25,259
there's a problem or not

434
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:26,879
um so we try to minimize um the workload

435
00:14:25,259 --> 00:14:28,379
at 100 because

436
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:30,179
um there's a lot going on especially

437
00:14:28,379 --> 00:14:32,820
with the the whole regulated side of

438
00:14:30,179 --> 00:14:34,199
things things to manage not just the

439
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,820
whole health of the cash cop we have all

440
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,259
these crazy things going on so you

441
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,399
definitely want to simplify take the

442
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:40,078
best of what we could what we can learn

443
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,339
from nature and apply it

444
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:43,620
um I go a little bit further with it

445
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:45,899
than some do no doubt uh but it's it's

446
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:48,060
not to say that uh I'm just going

447
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:49,759
willy-nilly I'm not just getting lucky

448
00:14:48,059 --> 00:14:52,018
um everything that we do has a sop

449
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:53,939
designed around it

450
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:55,919
um and we manage these things very very

451
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:57,480
thoroughly and precisely I see a lot of

452
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:59,578
people doing things that I was doing

453
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,019
eight years ago but just going crazy

454
00:14:59,578 --> 00:15:02,159
with their cover crops and like I'm

455
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:03,778
stoked for them they're having fun

456
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:04,799
they're learning or at least I hope

457
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:05,820
they're learning and they're paying

458
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:07,620
attention

459
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:10,440
um but I expect to see you know the

460
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:12,120
those people in years to come sharpen

461
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,500
their sticks a little bit and minimize

462
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,940
some of those potential risks like you

463
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,679
talked about

464
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:18,540
um I can't remember some of the other

465
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:21,299
points now because I'm I'm stuck on on

466
00:15:18,539 --> 00:15:24,599
the uh Hop Latin viroid

467
00:15:21,299 --> 00:15:26,458
um part of it now uh but you you I threw

468
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,740
a lot at you all your points are good

469
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:31,138
though invalidated points

470
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:32,220
um but yeah I just just I just seem a

471
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:33,419
little bit differently as far as some of

472
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:36,360
the solutions to them goes and how to

473
00:15:33,419 --> 00:15:37,500
use them but as far as the the hob Latin

474
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,278
viroid

475
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,839
um

476
00:15:38,278 --> 00:15:42,659
so

477
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:44,160
when we first opened up um we had a

478
00:15:42,659 --> 00:15:45,419
correct me from wrong but I think back

479
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:47,399
in the day everybody was referring to

480
00:15:45,419 --> 00:15:49,620
him as dads like I think pipsweed uh was

481
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:51,179
a dude online and we called them Duds uh

482
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:53,220
we call them over here at GOP we called

483
00:15:51,179 --> 00:15:54,719
them uh shiners um back to that pure

484
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:58,079
Sunshine strain

485
00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:00,240
um so uh in in medicinal geonomics

486
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:02,939
um so back in the day pure Sunshine

487
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,459
um had a hotline real bad

488
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:08,100
um uh every single time I planted a bed

489
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:09,958
it would dud out like 50 60 of that bed

490
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,519
would dead out I didn't think it was a

491
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:14,219
virus because I didn't see it spreading

492
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,539
to other plants so for like two years I

493
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:17,220
I thought I thought it was like a

494
00:16:15,539 --> 00:16:18,899
mutation I thought that back in the day

495
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:20,220
it was was it mutation it was a viroid

496
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:22,139
there was all these topic or all these

497
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:24,420
conversations going on um and I was on

498
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:27,299
team mutation based off of what I was

499
00:16:24,419 --> 00:16:29,099
seeing on on my commercial bro uh I

500
00:16:27,299 --> 00:16:30,599
thought it was if it was a virus it

501
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,620
would spread like wildfire throughout

502
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,778
the whole room

503
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:35,519
um and I just wasn't seeing that

504
00:16:33,778 --> 00:16:36,899
um we eventually pulled the pure

505
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,220
Sunshine because of that we couldn't

506
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:39,720
grow it no more it was just too much of

507
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,860
a pain in the ass

508
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,500
um

509
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:45,839
and uh be honest I don't see it anymore

510
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:48,539
I I used to see the occasional dutting

511
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:50,759
plant we see the occasional sick plant

512
00:16:48,539 --> 00:16:52,019
um and and and I just don't see it in

513
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:53,339
the morning and in the living organic

514
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:55,980
system and I leave roots in the system

515
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:57,540
and as far as root balls go um yeah you

516
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:59,820
have a great Point

517
00:16:57,539 --> 00:17:01,259
um but early on we would Harvest our

518
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:03,420
root balls

519
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:04,860
um to make room for the next pot and

520
00:17:03,419 --> 00:17:06,359
what we found out that we were doing is

521
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:08,159
we were harvesting the majority of the

522
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:10,078
life that we just grew

523
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,000
um the worms the bacteria the fungi

524
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:14,159
those are all nesting right there

525
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,539
feeding off those exudates so every time

526
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,058
you remove that root ball we just kind

527
00:17:15,539 --> 00:17:19,859
of took two steps back we said one foot

528
00:17:18,058 --> 00:17:22,078
step four or two steps back

529
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:25,139
um it got to a bad tour our our worms

530
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:26,519
population our beds was almost none um

531
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,780
just harvesting the root balls over and

532
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:29,099
over again

533
00:17:27,779 --> 00:17:31,259
um so that's when we started designing

534
00:17:29,099 --> 00:17:33,539
our grid technique where we planted here

535
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:35,640
one cycle the next cycle we plant right

536
00:17:33,539 --> 00:17:37,259
next to it allowing this root ball to

537
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,340
break down then all the biology do its

538
00:17:37,259 --> 00:17:41,339
thing

539
00:17:38,339 --> 00:17:42,899
um and again uh I I don't have I don't

540
00:17:41,339 --> 00:17:44,339
have dating plants I haven't seen a

541
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,440
dating plant since I got rid of pure

542
00:17:44,339 --> 00:17:48,538
Sunshine now that's not to say that this

543
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,340
virus isn't real I just believe that hey

544
00:17:48,538 --> 00:17:52,200
it's it's always been there I think

545
00:17:50,339 --> 00:17:54,058
certain plants are gonna you know hold

546
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,798
certain viral loads more than others or

547
00:17:54,058 --> 00:17:57,720
they're more susceptible

548
00:17:55,798 --> 00:17:59,220
um but if I had it my way every plant in

549
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,058
my facility

550
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:03,000
um

551
00:18:00,058 --> 00:18:04,918
what would be I want to say my meal but

552
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,440
would would have a little would be had

553
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:08,400
to be able to tolerate this virus

554
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,440
um that way I might have to worry about

555
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,780
it because I've seen people that tissue

556
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:14,340
culture 100 to their propagation method

557
00:18:12,779 --> 00:18:16,379
is through tissue culture because it's

558
00:18:14,339 --> 00:18:18,538
virus uh I feel like

559
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:20,100
that's a bit Overkill uh I I've

560
00:18:18,538 --> 00:18:21,900
literally walked in some of the most

561
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:24,359
highest state-of-the-art facilities with

562
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:27,600
100 teaching culture propagation process

563
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:29,459
and and sealed rooms this and sealed

564
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:31,740
rooms that and then they're showing this

565
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:33,298
whole tissue culture um set up and then

566
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:34,679
I go to one of their flowering rooms and

567
00:18:33,298 --> 00:18:37,139
it looks like a powdered donut factory

568
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:38,700
because their facility has powdery milk

569
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:40,559
there's not their plants

570
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:42,000
um and things of that nature so I feel

571
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:43,918
like it

572
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,019
viruses are real they're definitely out

573
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:48,538
there not to belittle that

574
00:18:46,019 --> 00:18:49,918
um I I think it's a bit of a of a scare

575
00:18:48,538 --> 00:18:52,079
tactic though just from a commercial

576
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,820
perspective I just don't see it as much

577
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:55,558
as I used to when I got rid of the

578
00:18:53,819 --> 00:18:58,379
strains I contained it or that that that

579
00:18:55,558 --> 00:19:00,359
showed it nowadays I

580
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:02,580
it's not even really a topic here at GOP

581
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:04,500
we don't see it no more

582
00:19:02,579 --> 00:19:07,439
I mean there is there is research to

583
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:09,900
show that certain genetics are going to

584
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:13,200
not express it as much

585
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:14,460
um based on the work by Dr punja um my

586
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,679
next podcast it's actually gonna come

587
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:19,500
out before this one will be all on Hop

588
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:20,759
late and viroid uh so I learned a lot on

589
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,319
that too

590
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:25,140
um the dining thing I think is

591
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:27,119
interesting because uh like from working

592
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:29,280
closely with my buddy Justin at Mako

593
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:32,759
farms and he absolutely has it because

594
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:34,980
we've tested for it there um he finds it

595
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:37,500
he can keep the plants healthy and not

596
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:39,960
stressed he doesn't see that expression

597
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:42,240
of of dating or the viroid itself so

598
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:45,120
like you I think if we can keep a plant

599
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,620
healthy and reduce stress we're not

600
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:49,079
going to see that expression of it

601
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:50,819
because it is a latent viroid and that

602
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:54,480
helps a lot so coming in with clean

603
00:19:50,819 --> 00:19:56,038
plants even if your bed is

604
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,599
um you know you had plants with roots

605
00:19:56,038 --> 00:19:58,140
that had the viroid

606
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:01,199
um

607
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:03,120
you're still able he he crops huge huge

608
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,759
yields and pulls a ton of biomass and I

609
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:06,599
know you do too so I know it is possible

610
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:08,819
um

611
00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:10,139
one other reason I like to pull Roots

612
00:20:08,819 --> 00:20:12,119
because you mentioned the worms thing

613
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:14,400
and the bacterian fungi and I think

614
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:15,899
that's that's interesting um

615
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,519
one of the reasons I like to pull Roots

616
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:19,798
is because of heavy metals as well so

617
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:22,019
lowering viral load removing heavy

618
00:20:19,798 --> 00:20:26,160
metals from the system through through

619
00:20:22,019 --> 00:20:28,079
biomass again I think is important if if

620
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:30,600
that's an issue for for a lot of

621
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:32,038
facilities and then for us with the

622
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:35,159
worms what we see is we see a lot of our

623
00:20:32,038 --> 00:20:38,160
worms coming up on the blue soak tape or

624
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:41,100
where the irrigation systems are so I

625
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:42,360
wonder if because of your watering and

626
00:20:41,099 --> 00:20:43,439
um well I guess you're watering the

627
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:45,298
whole bed because you have cover crops

628
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,160
in there my thought was maybe a lot of

629
00:20:45,298 --> 00:20:48,839
your worm populations are going to be

630
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:50,640
more concentrated in the root ball

631
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:54,298
versus what we're seeing and being more

632
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:56,820
along where the irrigation lines are run

633
00:20:54,298 --> 00:21:00,058
because I haven't noticed a large change

634
00:20:56,819 --> 00:21:02,220
in worm populations based off of

635
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:04,678
how long but you were probably shaking

636
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:07,380
the The Roots back into the bed

637
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:09,960
or the downstairs yeah yeah so so when

638
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:11,580
we Harvest typically we you know you you

639
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,620
get the plant out and then you shake off

640
00:21:11,579 --> 00:21:15,359
the soil and then you take the you know

641
00:21:13,619 --> 00:21:17,219
so we're not getting all the root hairs

642
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:18,538
and everything out of the bed it's a

643
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:21,900
pretty quick

644
00:21:18,538 --> 00:21:23,940
simple process that makes sense uh yeah

645
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:26,519
ours is a little bit different but real

646
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:28,140
quick back to the the virus too um it's

647
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:30,058
all about setting the stage too so I

648
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:32,038
think if you you know people always ask

649
00:21:30,058 --> 00:21:34,859
oh you you have all these bacteria and

650
00:21:32,038 --> 00:21:36,900
fungi and how are they not how do these

651
00:21:34,859 --> 00:21:38,879
bad ones not take over how do you not

652
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:40,259
get but try this how do you not get hot

653
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,059
black how do you not get all these

654
00:21:40,259 --> 00:21:43,619
things because I'm not setting the stage

655
00:21:42,058 --> 00:21:45,720
for those things that we try to you know

656
00:21:43,619 --> 00:21:47,939
maintain a healthy aerobic environment

657
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:50,400
full of diversity

658
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:51,960
um of beneficial organisms but you know

659
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,360
typically you have to set the stage like

660
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:56,400
similar to the whole don't judge a fish

661
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:57,779
by how well it climbs a tree

662
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,700
um if I keep that fish in the water it's

663
00:21:57,779 --> 00:22:01,200
gonna be great you know if I keep that

664
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:03,480
cat out of the water in the tree it's

665
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,460
gonna do great uh so just setting the

666
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,599
stage for for for whatever it is that

667
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:08,279
you're trying to do for the proper

668
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:09,599
outcome I think is key

669
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:11,099
um so good air circulation good

670
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:13,439
filtration

671
00:22:11,099 --> 00:22:15,899
um good healthy aerobic soil good good

672
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,400
um good compost all these things good

673
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:19,980
practices are going to help set the

674
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:21,659
stage for success uh where if you're

675
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:23,579
willy-nillian going in there you know

676
00:22:21,659 --> 00:22:24,600
hand watering without a meter

677
00:22:23,579 --> 00:22:26,279
um you're not following the schedule

678
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:28,619
you're doing all these crazy cool kid

679
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:29,940
techniques you see on the Instagram

680
00:22:28,619 --> 00:22:31,279
um what are you setting the stage for

681
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:33,720
you know

682
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:34,918
yeah and you've brought up your Sops

683
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:37,079
multiple times

684
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:39,780
um I did a recent podcast with Cassandra

685
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:42,839
maffey just talking about Sops I don't

686
00:22:39,779 --> 00:22:45,240
think people give enough credit to how

687
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:46,918
important Sops are and following them

688
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,940
because

689
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:49,679
um

690
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:51,298
that's I think that's what makes uh

691
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:53,519
separates kind of like a good grower

692
00:22:51,298 --> 00:22:55,918
from a great grower or a bad grower from

693
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:57,960
a good grower is having Sops and

694
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:00,840
following them

695
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:02,759
yeah no it's definitely key um like I

696
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:05,639
don't grow for the most part I don't

697
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:08,400
grow cannabis anymore I grow employees

698
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:09,179
um and and they they follow Sops that I

699
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,860
wrote

700
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:12,298
um and it's in this clutch that way if

701
00:23:10,859 --> 00:23:13,678
something goes wrong we can look back to

702
00:23:12,298 --> 00:23:15,839
hey what did you do did you follow the

703
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:17,159
SOP oh you didn't okay well that's the

704
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:18,899
problem and we can always kind of find

705
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:20,220
the problem that way and work towards a

706
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:21,720
solution

707
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:24,058
um but then also estate Regulators

708
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:25,679
they're then ask for Sops like when one

709
00:23:24,058 --> 00:23:27,779
state regulars come in and especially

710
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,640
that they've only seen clean sterile

711
00:23:27,779 --> 00:23:32,158
grows and they start seeing all those

712
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:34,380
crazy cover crops in in in in beneficial

713
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,900
insects heavywear they're going to want

714
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:38,340
to see Sops that show that you're in

715
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:40,140
control of these things that you're in

716
00:23:38,339 --> 00:23:41,399
control of these processes

717
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:43,860
um otherwise it doesn't mean everything

718
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:46,740
a passing disease and shut you down so

719
00:23:43,859 --> 00:23:49,619
uh Sops are definitely the way to go

720
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:52,440
um yeah 100 but I hate it I hate writing

721
00:23:49,619 --> 00:23:54,178
them uh my wife is uh is really big on

722
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:56,220
Sops he just raised her hands shout out

723
00:23:54,179 --> 00:23:59,280
to kuanine uh that's kind of her

724
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:01,079
strength uh is is the the whole she

725
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:03,178
takes my craziness and it makes it legal

726
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:04,439
basically she put basically fits into

727
00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:06,059
regulation

728
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,159
yeah let's give a shout out to your wife

729
00:24:06,058 --> 00:24:09,658
because uh I know she does a lot behind

730
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,039
the scenes I know you're the face of glp

731
00:24:09,659 --> 00:24:12,840
but I know that she's really the heart

732
00:24:11,038 --> 00:24:14,339
of it too and uh I don't think she gets

733
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:16,740
enough credit for everything she does

734
00:24:14,339 --> 00:24:18,899
She lays well she she stays out of the

735
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:20,700
Limelight dude but she's definitely

736
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:22,500
um I basically built her business

737
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:24,000
basically I built the business for her

738
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:27,298
to run

739
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,519
awesome awesome all right so uh I feel

740
00:24:27,298 --> 00:24:31,259
like we covered a lot in this podcast

741
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:34,079
um one thing that we absolutely need to

742
00:24:31,259 --> 00:24:36,839
talk about though before signing off is

743
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:38,339
um bottomless pots and this Tech this

744
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:40,319
Tech that you came up with

745
00:24:38,339 --> 00:24:41,759
um I think it's really interesting why

746
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:43,500
don't you share sort of your your

747
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:46,440
thought process and then how it's been

748
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:48,179
working in reality yeah so uh you know

749
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:51,000
when we first uh started GOP um we were

750
00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:53,038
digging um half gallon gallon pots um

751
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,319
into our soil so we dig out the soil we

752
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:56,700
took out we didn't go into a bin uh we

753
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:58,980
put a pot in there that's what we took

754
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:01,080
out we're then going to the next cycle

755
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:03,120
um of the edge uh and that was our whole

756
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:04,379
process for a long time and and then we

757
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:05,759
just that's when we started harvesting

758
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,840
our worms and things like that by taking

759
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:08,158
out the old Brews that's when we

760
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:09,959
designed the root system I'm sorry a

761
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:12,059
grid pattern to where you plant here one

762
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:13,319
cycle plant here the next cycle so

763
00:25:12,058 --> 00:25:14,759
you're just constantly switching grids

764
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:16,079
each cycle

765
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:17,220
um but we were still digging holes

766
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:19,199
there's still quite a bit of soil

767
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:21,960
disturbance I'm trying to stay true to

768
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,279
the whole um no-till uh or no sole

769
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:25,798
disturbance

770
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:27,720
um scheme of things uh it just never

771
00:25:25,798 --> 00:25:29,158
kind of felt right uh it just felt like

772
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:31,919
we're kind of I don't know taking a step

773
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:34,679
back every time uh and then one day I uh

774
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:36,659
I had a seed plant and it's a small pot

775
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:38,580
and I was supposed to transplant it got

776
00:25:36,659 --> 00:25:40,080
busy forgot to transplant it I sat down

777
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:42,720
on the mother bed never got around to it

778
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:44,579
it came back like a week later and this

779
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,860
plant it was totally stressed out and

780
00:25:44,579 --> 00:25:49,199
yeah following a week later was just

781
00:25:46,859 --> 00:25:51,359
completely blown up re-greened super

782
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,460
healthy I want to grab it to move it and

783
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:54,899
it was it was stuck to the bed and and I

784
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:56,278
was like man this is kind of kind of

785
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:58,259
like the old rock wool they said the

786
00:25:56,278 --> 00:26:00,240
Little Rock Wall on the big rock wool um

787
00:25:58,259 --> 00:26:01,798
kind of technique and my gears just

788
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,900
started rolling just thinking about all

789
00:26:01,798 --> 00:26:05,700
the labor we can save um if we not to

790
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:08,038
dig holes and the mess that we wouldn't

791
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:10,140
have to make if we got to dig holes and

792
00:26:08,038 --> 00:26:12,839
uh so I just took a I think it was 12

793
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:14,759
pots um I cut the bottoms off plastic

794
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:17,639
pots set them on a saucer fill them with

795
00:26:14,759 --> 00:26:19,798
soil put some clowns into it I let the

796
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:21,960
root ball develop at the bottom um so it

797
00:26:19,798 --> 00:26:23,278
kind of held also at the bottom and then

798
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:25,500
we're just able to Simply pick them up

799
00:26:23,278 --> 00:26:27,960
and then set them on top of the beds not

800
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:29,519
dig a single Hole uh and then the plants

801
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:31,980
would just continue growing downward the

802
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:33,658
original going downward into the beds

803
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:36,000
um now when we first did this it was all

804
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:37,440
I was thinking was reducing labor was

805
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,079
the main goal

806
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:42,058
oh and we achieved that we it turned uh

807
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:43,259
what took us a day and a half turned

808
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:45,000
into a half day

809
00:26:43,259 --> 00:26:46,319
um I have two female Growers that run my

810
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,819
entire facility

811
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:49,200
um it took them a half day to place we

812
00:26:47,819 --> 00:26:50,879
call placing a room

813
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,159
um we don't plant we place

814
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:55,200
um so anyways we started with a small

815
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:56,580
bed here and there I'm doing it I I

816
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,900
didn't show it at first because I was

817
00:26:56,579 --> 00:27:00,480
too embarrassed too for a long time I

818
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:01,740
had to make sure it works because nobody

819
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,298
nobody was doing this at the time you

820
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:05,159
know I want to put my foot in my mouth

821
00:27:03,298 --> 00:27:06,240
um so I actually did it for about a year

822
00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:07,799
or so

823
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,778
um and then people started seeing

824
00:27:07,798 --> 00:27:11,158
pictures of the of the bed in the corner

825
00:27:09,778 --> 00:27:12,359
we started asking questions what's going

826
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:13,860
on over there

827
00:27:12,359 --> 00:27:15,899
um and then we did the whole Grassroots

828
00:27:13,859 --> 00:27:17,699
I reached out to Tyler from Grassroots I

829
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:19,919
had to make a fabric version of the pot

830
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:21,360
without a bottom on it and those guys

831
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:22,620
are awesome by the way whatever you need

832
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:25,379
those guys are willing to do they're

833
00:27:22,619 --> 00:27:26,879
pretty pretty cool and very versatile

834
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:28,500
um anyways so we ran with the bottomless

835
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,539
pod technique and just kind of designed

836
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,980
the whole system off it and uh what we

837
00:27:30,538 --> 00:27:34,200
kind of learned was yes it's a

838
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:35,278
drastically save the amount of Labor and

839
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,140
the amount of mess you make the amount

840
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:39,599
of soil disturbance all those things are

841
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:41,580
definitely then cut back on it but then

842
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:44,879
to our surprise is we got faster better

843
00:27:41,579 --> 00:27:47,220
growth rates we managed to reduce the

844
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,900
amount of transplant shock uh the plants

845
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:51,419
to seem to just take off faster and

846
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:54,000
healthier so in my system we can't

847
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:55,860
really shed time off of it but I get 4.3

848
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,798
Cycles a year just to be clear on that

849
00:27:55,859 --> 00:28:00,359
so I get I get uh I get 13 harvests a

850
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:02,158
year is what I get

851
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:03,719
um but uh we can't really afford to save

852
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:06,480
time the way my systems work I have

853
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:08,100
seasons Set uh and and my Seasons don't

854
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,058
wait for plants my plans don't wait for

855
00:28:08,099 --> 00:28:10,678
the season

856
00:28:09,058 --> 00:28:12,298
um it's just it's A Clockwork I've been

857
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:13,620
running the same schedule for eight and

858
00:28:12,298 --> 00:28:14,940
a half years now without missing a

859
00:28:13,619 --> 00:28:15,658
single beat

860
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:18,360
um

861
00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:19,500
uh uh I forgot my I forgot what I was

862
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:20,278
saying with that

863
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,720
um

864
00:28:20,278 --> 00:28:24,480
yeah my bad where were we at about that

865
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:27,900
sorry uh no you you covered a lot of it

866
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:29,640
um I guess what so the originally

867
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:32,700
started as like a labor saving thing and

868
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:34,559
then it became an actual like better not

869
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:37,019
only was it saving labor but it was also

870
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:38,700
uh yeah why was that giving you better

871
00:28:37,019 --> 00:28:40,918
yields yeah I couldn't save time because

872
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:43,019
of our schedule but what I did was in

873
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:45,778
the same amount of time I had allocated

874
00:28:43,019 --> 00:28:47,400
to grow my plants and veg my plants I

875
00:28:45,778 --> 00:28:49,679
was able to grow my plants twice as big

876
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:51,538
so it didn't save me time in it because

877
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:54,360
again we're kind of set on a schedule

878
00:28:51,538 --> 00:28:56,158
but it did get more out of the time so

879
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:58,379
our plans just went to flower much

880
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:00,600
bigger much healthier and we've seen a

881
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:01,679
huge increase in yields by doing it over

882
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:03,178
time

883
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:05,159
um the only place I would say it might

884
00:29:03,179 --> 00:29:07,559
not work one if you're a home Gardener

885
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:09,299
and you got a small sale maybe a ceiling

886
00:29:07,558 --> 00:29:11,038
height is an issue

887
00:29:09,298 --> 00:29:12,720
um maybe it's not the best technique for

888
00:29:11,038 --> 00:29:14,099
you but if you're a large-scale

889
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,319
commercial grower you're planting you

890
00:29:14,099 --> 00:29:18,480
know thousands of plants a month and you

891
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:21,599
have high Bay ceilings I definitely

892
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:23,640
think it's a technique worth trying uh

893
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:25,980
try it on one bed first or try it on one

894
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:27,899
pot first see if you like it I think

895
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:31,140
you'd be surprised on how easy and how

896
00:29:27,898 --> 00:29:32,819
just simple the whole thing works

897
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:34,140
yeah it's definitely something I want to

898
00:29:32,819 --> 00:29:37,319
play around with I think it's a really

899
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:40,200
interesting concept and very like very

900
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:41,639
ingenious so yeah hats off to you on

901
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,080
that I think it's very cool

902
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:45,960
um

903
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:47,939
one question I had is what lessons have

904
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:49,500
you learned in terms of like

905
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:51,720
like tips and pointers for people who

906
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:53,940
want to try it out like uh is there a

907
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:55,079
certain size pot that you think works

908
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:57,120
best

909
00:29:55,079 --> 00:29:58,500
um I I don't know any watering

910
00:29:57,119 --> 00:30:00,959
differences

911
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:02,339
um yeah I mean I would say uh make sure

912
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,019
you clear the soil off you don't want to

913
00:30:02,339 --> 00:30:05,398
be setting it on like uh if you if

914
00:30:04,019 --> 00:30:07,079
you're running a living mulch or any

915
00:30:05,398 --> 00:30:08,519
type of mulch you don't want to set it

916
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:10,740
on top of your mold testers this doesn't

917
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:12,359
cause decomposing the root Zone like

918
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:14,759
rotting and stuff like that you want to

919
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:16,259
avoid so make sure you clear you get a

920
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:17,460
nice little access point to the soil

921
00:30:16,259 --> 00:30:20,519
straight into the soil when you set it

922
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:22,440
down I recommend watering the pots

923
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:24,480
directly

924
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:27,058
um at least a couple times a week for

925
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,200
the first like you know two week and a

926
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:30,240
half two weeks

927
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:32,278
um give the the the plants time for

928
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,960
their roots to grow into the beds

929
00:30:32,278 --> 00:30:35,759
um so because yeah I think quite enough

930
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:37,679
capillary reaction to to water up

931
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:38,700
through those pots from the bed so I'm

932
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,200
going to want to water them directly

933
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:42,120
once the roots get into the bed you're

934
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:44,399
fine you can kind of ignore the pots and

935
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:46,798
just focus on the bit at that point

936
00:30:44,398 --> 00:30:48,719
um other than that yeah it's it's pretty

937
00:30:46,798 --> 00:30:50,038
self-explanatory I do the video on my

938
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,620
Instagram

939
00:30:50,038 --> 00:30:54,599
um that kind of explained it and people

940
00:30:52,619 --> 00:30:56,459
ask me all the time and it looks like I

941
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:58,379
don't answer but all I do is I tag them

942
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:59,519
in the original video

943
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:01,500
um so that I don't have to explain the

944
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:03,658
whole thing so feel free to ask me

945
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:05,278
online anytime I'm just gonna go and tag

946
00:31:03,659 --> 00:31:07,260
you in the original video and you can

947
00:31:05,278 --> 00:31:09,179
watch it it's about 10 minutes long and

948
00:31:07,259 --> 00:31:10,558
it gives a whole detailed breakdown on

949
00:31:09,179 --> 00:31:11,580
on what I've learned and not much has

950
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:12,898
changed

951
00:31:11,579 --> 00:31:14,639
um since I made that video and I don't

952
00:31:12,898 --> 00:31:16,619
think anything's really changed

953
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,820
um since the making of that video

954
00:31:16,619 --> 00:31:20,639
um yeah it's still running it very

955
00:31:17,819 --> 00:31:23,099
strong now uh our state Regulators hated

956
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:25,799
the idea of bottomless pause and fought

957
00:31:23,099 --> 00:31:28,079
me insanely hard on the idea for

958
00:31:25,798 --> 00:31:30,298
absolutely no reason

959
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:32,339
um and uh what's that

960
00:31:30,298 --> 00:31:34,918
yeah they actually even call Tyler and

961
00:31:32,339 --> 00:31:36,000
they had all kinds of weird like that

962
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:38,520
was crazy

963
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,579
um but it's now it's a it's a validated

964
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:43,319
technique that you can use in Nevada

965
00:31:41,579 --> 00:31:45,798
um that they aren't arguing anymore so

966
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:45,798
that's kind of cool

967
00:31:45,898 --> 00:31:51,719
that's so they wanted to talk to the

968
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:53,519
manufacturer of the pots about yeah they

969
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:55,440
they that's crazy you gotta understand

970
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:57,298
these Regulators they come in they walk

971
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,620
a thousand grows and they're all you

972
00:31:57,298 --> 00:32:00,778
know sterile

973
00:31:58,619 --> 00:32:03,298
um you know chemical facilities and they

974
00:32:00,778 --> 00:32:05,278
walk into GOP and they're just like what

975
00:32:03,298 --> 00:32:07,200
is this place no way any of this is

976
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:09,538
legal uh so there's always this huge

977
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,159
learning curve that we have to

978
00:32:09,538 --> 00:32:13,319
um walk them through and this last year

979
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:16,080
this new Regulators of the CCB in Nevada

980
00:32:13,319 --> 00:32:18,000
have been extremely difficult

981
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:20,759
um and we've spent a lot of time

982
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,480
educating them on just Organics in

983
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:23,460
general

984
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:25,620
um for everybody's sake because a lot of

985
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:26,640
these regulating bodies are gonna take

986
00:32:25,619 --> 00:32:28,619
the same

987
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,120
um regulations and just kind of repeat

988
00:32:28,619 --> 00:32:32,699
them over and over again until we get to

989
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:34,259
Federal legalization so if once stays

990
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:36,600
successful in something then the other

991
00:32:34,259 --> 00:32:38,940
say system repeat it similar to disaster

992
00:32:36,599 --> 00:32:41,158
you need to knit this in the ass before

993
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:43,500
um Camp becomes pretty legal because

994
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:44,159
then we get to able to change anything

995
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,859
um

996
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:49,799
but for the most part uh yeah bottomless

997
00:32:46,859 --> 00:32:51,479
pause for the win for sure

998
00:32:49,798 --> 00:32:53,639
yeah you know it's funny because people

999
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:56,460
see us online and sort of you know I

1000
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:57,960
guess we have personas or you know we

1001
00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:00,120
share what what we do and what we

1002
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,840
believe and people think that we're

1003
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:02,459
um

1004
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:04,199
you know we don't agree on a lot of

1005
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:06,659
stuff or that we're like opposed to each

1006
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:08,340
other but in reality like at the end of

1007
00:33:06,659 --> 00:33:10,380
the day like we're all trying to promote

1008
00:33:08,339 --> 00:33:13,379
regenerative practices sustainable

1009
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:16,440
agriculture organic cultivation we're

1010
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:18,059
all on the same side and uh I love being

1011
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,558
able to have these conversations because

1012
00:33:18,058 --> 00:33:21,538
one of the things I I struggle with

1013
00:33:19,558 --> 00:33:23,639
online and it's really discouraging and

1014
00:33:21,538 --> 00:33:25,379
I bet you see this too is like anyone

1015
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:27,000
can leave a comment on your video anyone

1016
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:28,620
can make a comment on social media and

1017
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,119
they can be they can be jerks they can

1018
00:33:28,619 --> 00:33:32,158
say whatever they want and be critical

1019
00:33:30,119 --> 00:33:33,538
and like this is your life this is your

1020
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:35,159
career this is what feeds your family

1021
00:33:33,538 --> 00:33:37,440
and you put a lot of your passion into

1022
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:40,799
it and it can be really discouraging

1023
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:43,679
um so like and it's hard to have a civil

1024
00:33:40,798 --> 00:33:45,058
conversation you know personal attacks

1025
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:47,340
come into play other things that aren't

1026
00:33:45,058 --> 00:33:49,139
related to the topic and I found that

1027
00:33:47,339 --> 00:33:51,298
people like yourself that I can have a

1028
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:53,278
conversation with and stay on topic even

1029
00:33:51,298 --> 00:33:55,440
if we you know have slight differences

1030
00:33:53,278 --> 00:33:57,599
in opinion that level of respect goes a

1031
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,798
long way so thank you all right I

1032
00:33:57,599 --> 00:34:00,599
appreciate you man there's not too many

1033
00:33:58,798 --> 00:34:02,700
people's opinion I appreciate or respect

1034
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:03,898
more than yours that's why I started off

1035
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:06,240
saying this like

1036
00:34:03,898 --> 00:34:08,279
if people don't listen to you and and

1037
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:10,139
and consider what you're saying they're

1038
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:12,300
only going to prove you right as far as

1039
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:13,740
no cover crops and things of that nature

1040
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:15,300
you have to listen to everything you say

1041
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:17,039
everything you've ever said whether I

1042
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:18,720
disagree with it or not I had to take

1043
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:20,820
into consideration earlier and it kind

1044
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:23,779
of pushed me to either you know level up

1045
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:26,039
or or even change some things you know

1046
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:27,780
awesome man will you you challenged me

1047
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:29,398
too and uh if people like this podcast

1048
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:31,080
we'll have to follow up with other

1049
00:34:29,398 --> 00:34:33,358
topics and other conversations because

1050
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:35,819
uh I think I think it's a lot of fun and

1051
00:34:33,358 --> 00:34:37,980
I enjoy the chat so thanks again for

1052
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:39,179
your time uh I got one question for you

1053
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:41,219
before we go because you mentioned

1054
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:42,418
something oh earlier before I get to

1055
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:43,739
other department you can cut this out

1056
00:34:42,418 --> 00:34:45,539
later if you want

1057
00:34:43,739 --> 00:34:47,398
um we mentioned um uh I saw a video

1058
00:34:45,539 --> 00:34:49,559
earlier you're talking about teas and

1059
00:34:47,398 --> 00:34:51,118
you had mentioned a manure team

1060
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:52,799
um that people do and how it could have

1061
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:54,179
certain contaminants

1062
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,139
um and I just want to be real I just

1063
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:56,398
want to say something some people real

1064
00:34:55,139 --> 00:34:58,680
quick I know we don't like talking

1065
00:34:56,398 --> 00:34:59,880
regulations and things like that but in

1066
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:00,960
the last two years I've learned some

1067
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,220
really important things first of all

1068
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,780
food wave community that you all need to

1069
00:35:02,219 --> 00:35:05,759
take into consideration

1070
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:08,160
um and there's certain um guidelines in

1071
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,500
in the in regulations that we have to

1072
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:11,819
follow that no one is

1073
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:13,619
um so when the state tried to shut me

1074
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:15,420
down one of the things that they quoted

1075
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:17,700
me on was I think it was a they was it

1076
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:19,500
NOP water guideline quality

1077
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:21,719
was it MLP right

1078
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:23,460
so it was an NLP water quality

1079
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:25,319
guidelines um saying you have to have

1080
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:29,400
below a certain amount of like E coli

1081
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:31,859
and this other type of bacteria so in

1082
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:34,559
order for you to do a compost tea you

1083
00:35:31,858 --> 00:35:38,039
have to have a uh you have to have a

1084
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:39,719
thermophil or a a validated method of

1085
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:42,358
composting so you have to use like a

1086
00:35:39,719 --> 00:35:44,098
thermophilic compost so that that could

1087
00:35:42,358 --> 00:35:46,559
be a problem for a lot of knif guys use

1088
00:35:44,099 --> 00:35:48,240
their imos and and things like that not

1089
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:50,039
to say that there's an issue with those

1090
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:52,618
techniques but I'm saying if they're not

1091
00:35:50,039 --> 00:35:53,519
validated by the USDA or NLP

1092
00:35:52,619 --> 00:35:55,858
um you're not going to be able to use

1093
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:57,358
them much longer okay now once you get a

1094
00:35:55,858 --> 00:35:58,679
validated method like thermophilic

1095
00:35:57,358 --> 00:36:00,719
compost and you end up with a good high

1096
00:35:58,679 --> 00:36:02,219
quality compost then you make a tea brew

1097
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:04,618
and you have to make two separate tea

1098
00:36:02,219 --> 00:36:07,319
Brews with the same recipe and again

1099
00:36:04,619 --> 00:36:09,180
both tested by a third-party lab to show

1100
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:11,820
that they're below a certain amount of

1101
00:36:09,179 --> 00:36:14,639
of uh of E coli in a camera where the

1102
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:16,920
other bacteria is until you do that you

1103
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:18,598
cannot legally use a compost tea now

1104
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:20,940
extracts without Brewing you can use

1105
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:23,280
without limitation uh if you're using a

1106
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:25,500
thermosilla compost but teas you have to

1107
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:27,780
get tested by a third party

1108
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:29,219
um just throw that out there guys uh it

1109
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:31,380
sucks I did it

1110
00:36:29,219 --> 00:36:33,239
um and it's a yearly thing

1111
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:34,920
is that in the that's in the state of

1112
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:37,379
Nevada then yeah but it's it's actually

1113
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:38,820
it's actually an NLP um type USDA water

1114
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:40,740
guideline thing so it's actually a

1115
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:43,019
national restriction that the state of

1116
00:36:40,739 --> 00:36:44,699
Nevada found and just tried to hold me

1117
00:36:43,019 --> 00:36:46,259
to we we looked for months before we

1118
00:36:44,699 --> 00:36:48,118
even found out how to use Chris Von Hook

1119
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:49,619
from clean Green certified to actually

1120
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:51,539
find the regulation they were speaking

1121
00:36:49,619 --> 00:36:53,640
of because they misquoted the number and

1122
00:36:51,539 --> 00:36:55,619
just sent us on this Rat Race

1123
00:36:53,639 --> 00:36:57,779
um so people just got to realize that uh

1124
00:36:55,619 --> 00:36:59,220
like the Dr Lane mingum I kind of hinted

1125
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:00,540
at it earlier

1126
00:36:59,219 --> 00:37:02,699
um there's a lot of things she does like

1127
00:37:00,539 --> 00:37:04,500
with counting um you know in science and

1128
00:37:02,699 --> 00:37:06,000
a lot of these um these Regulators if

1129
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:07,800
you can't count it it's not science it's

1130
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,239
Bro Science and you're done

1131
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,740
um so that's why a lot of those crazy

1132
00:37:09,239 --> 00:37:13,019
things I don't really

1133
00:37:10,739 --> 00:37:13,799
sign up for it so much or uh subscribe

1134
00:37:13,019 --> 00:37:15,480
to

1135
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,760
um they do they do kind of make sense um

1136
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:20,219
under the right you know perspective uh

1137
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:22,440
on the under the the realm of Regulation

1138
00:37:20,219 --> 00:37:24,179
I guess uh so just be careful if you're

1139
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:26,099
out there if you're using these validate

1140
00:37:24,179 --> 00:37:27,598
techniques you're trying to write Sops

1141
00:37:26,099 --> 00:37:30,059
um based off of

1142
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:32,160
um something you did in your home bro uh

1143
00:37:30,059 --> 00:37:34,320
just just take a look to look take a

1144
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:36,659
time to look into USDA and I'm not a fan

1145
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:38,579
of USDA um regulations or any

1146
00:37:36,659 --> 00:37:40,139
regulations for that matter

1147
00:37:38,579 --> 00:37:42,359
um but it's worth looking into before

1148
00:37:40,139 --> 00:37:45,118
designing an entire system

1149
00:37:42,358 --> 00:37:47,819
um around practices that may not be you

1150
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:49,858
know allowed

1151
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:51,539
yeah I mean there are NLP guidelines

1152
00:37:49,858 --> 00:37:53,519
that actually I don't know if they've

1153
00:37:51,539 --> 00:37:55,380
tried to apply these to you but um I

1154
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:57,059
think it's 60 days before Harvest you

1155
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:58,559
can't apply a compost tea and that's

1156
00:37:57,059 --> 00:38:00,779
just a standard NOP guideline yeah

1157
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:01,500
that's been around for decades

1158
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:03,920
um

1159
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:07,079
uh just to prevent E coli salmonella

1160
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:08,940
contamination on leafy greens and things

1161
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:10,680
like that yeah and I think that's again

1162
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:12,240
it's a compost tea regulation and I

1163
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:15,059
think that's also if you're using manure

1164
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:16,618
in your compost or or animal byproducts

1165
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:18,420
I think is when that one comes into play

1166
00:38:16,619 --> 00:38:20,220
if I'm not mistaken the exact uh

1167
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:22,019
verbiage in that one um but yeah no

1168
00:38:20,219 --> 00:38:23,939
there's a hundred percent little little

1169
00:38:22,019 --> 00:38:25,019
little tricks like that you have to be

1170
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:28,019
aware of

1171
00:38:25,019 --> 00:38:29,460
um again like if this is a cash crop so

1172
00:38:28,019 --> 00:38:32,460
people it's becoming more and more

1173
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:34,559
popular in in it More Money More

1174
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:36,900
Problems for the organic grower I'll

1175
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:38,338
tell you that for sure so it just helps

1176
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,900
to be aware of these things

1177
00:38:38,338 --> 00:38:41,219
um for sure I recommend people getting

1178
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:43,680
online just kind of looking at UST

1179
00:38:41,219 --> 00:38:45,539
regulations and kind of applying that to

1180
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:48,299
their facility as much as possible just

1181
00:38:45,539 --> 00:38:49,920
for the long-term success of their

1182
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:52,440
facility of their business it's

1183
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:54,358
definitely worth looking at

1184
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:56,338
yeah I think the regulatory side is

1185
00:38:54,358 --> 00:38:57,960
important I think the the actual risk

1186
00:38:56,338 --> 00:39:00,358
associated with compost tees is

1187
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:02,699
significantly lower

1188
00:39:00,358 --> 00:39:03,960
um than is stated by a lot of people and

1189
00:39:02,699 --> 00:39:06,000
that's you know this idea that people

1190
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:08,099
need to move to a compost extract

1191
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,780
um from a regulatory reason I I think

1192
00:39:08,099 --> 00:39:12,240
that can make a lot of sense but aerated

1193
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:14,519
compost D's in general have so much more

1194
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:16,139
microbial activity in nutrient cycling

1195
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:19,559
that I think they have a lot of benefit

1196
00:39:16,139 --> 00:39:21,480
when you use the right compost that's

1197
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:22,739
really the key to it and you know a

1198
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:25,320
brewer that's going to create the

1199
00:39:22,739 --> 00:39:26,939
optimal you know dissolved oxygen levels

1200
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:29,640
that you need but

1201
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:31,559
um yeah my dad did testing with Elaine

1202
00:39:29,639 --> 00:39:34,019
you know decades ago where they

1203
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:35,940
intentionally introduced E coli and it

1204
00:39:34,019 --> 00:39:37,739
was you know the kiss Brewer that they

1205
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:39,599
used and found that the E coli did

1206
00:39:37,739 --> 00:39:42,059
couldn't survive in in some of these

1207
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:44,280
highly aerobic conditions so

1208
00:39:42,059 --> 00:39:45,719
uh you know I'm like I said I think I

1209
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:47,160
think the risk is overstated but it's

1210
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:49,078
absolutely there

1211
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:51,299
um a lot of the failures I hear for

1212
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:53,640
people failing for E coli in agriculture

1213
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:55,859
were actually from like having cows

1214
00:39:53,639 --> 00:39:57,539
Upstream that were crapping in the water

1215
00:39:55,858 --> 00:39:59,098
and then that irrigation water gets

1216
00:39:57,539 --> 00:40:00,719
pumped onto the leaves of the plants and

1217
00:39:59,099 --> 00:40:03,059
then and then the plants get you know

1218
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:04,858
the lettuce and stuff gets hit so

1219
00:40:03,059 --> 00:40:07,199
yeah manures are definitely something

1220
00:40:04,858 --> 00:40:09,358
that that people need to be careful with

1221
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:11,039
and yeah I think there's probably do

1222
00:40:09,358 --> 00:40:14,098
some more posts on on compost tea

1223
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:15,838
because uh yeah so I mean it's an

1224
00:40:14,099 --> 00:40:17,519
interesting topic and I love compost

1225
00:40:15,838 --> 00:40:18,838
teas I think less is more as far as

1226
00:40:17,519 --> 00:40:20,280
their food source I think it's a lot of

1227
00:40:18,838 --> 00:40:22,320
problem people have is they over feed

1228
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:23,940
their compost teas it goes anaerobic

1229
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:25,559
before they can get back and then now

1230
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:27,300
they're just kind of watering you know

1231
00:40:25,559 --> 00:40:28,440
some ciliate poop soup kind of thing

1232
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,880
going on

1233
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:32,099
um I think that's the main thing is like

1234
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:34,380
on Commercial scale extract teas are

1235
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:36,838
harder to mess up uh where I could brew

1236
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:39,480
a bad team have to double down the drain

1237
00:40:36,838 --> 00:40:41,460
um so I my my garden my Growers are all

1238
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:42,838
certified on the Elaine system so they

1239
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:44,159
know how to use a microscope and Tech

1240
00:40:42,838 --> 00:40:46,199
teas

1241
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:47,578
um as far as like human pathogens we've

1242
00:40:46,199 --> 00:40:49,439
never had an issue with human pathogens

1243
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:51,300
and teas it's always just been with the

1244
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:53,519
wrong organisms as far as like ciliates

1245
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:56,220
uh that have been the the the main game

1246
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:58,139
changer for a good team versus a bad tea

1247
00:40:56,219 --> 00:41:01,019
um just it's not very efficient nutrient

1248
00:40:58,139 --> 00:41:03,239
cyclers uh in the in the long run

1249
00:41:01,019 --> 00:41:05,699
um but yeah it's compost tea for for

1250
00:41:03,239 --> 00:41:08,039
foliers extracts for drenches that's

1251
00:41:05,699 --> 00:41:09,719
kind of our our routine

1252
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:11,579
yeah and I don't think people realize

1253
00:41:09,719 --> 00:41:13,980
just how much fertility they're bringing

1254
00:41:11,579 --> 00:41:16,380
in sometimes with these compost teas

1255
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:19,320
um they're probably getting nitrates uh

1256
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:20,579
as well as other minerals and so we've

1257
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:22,380
seen people that are like we didn't do

1258
00:41:20,579 --> 00:41:24,359
anything this cycle but compost teas and

1259
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:26,099
their soil tests show an increase in

1260
00:41:24,358 --> 00:41:28,380
fertility at the end of the cycle

1261
00:41:26,099 --> 00:41:31,680
sometimes with nitrogen being like way

1262
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:32,820
too high so it is something that I want

1263
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:34,799
to mention for folks that are

1264
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:37,920
considering you know some of these knf

1265
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:39,960
options some of the the compost teas

1266
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:42,180
whether it's an extract or an aerated

1267
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:44,220
compost tea you are bringing in

1268
00:41:42,179 --> 00:41:46,139
nutrients and those can impact your

1269
00:41:44,219 --> 00:41:47,399
plant For Better or For Worse a lot of

1270
00:41:46,139 --> 00:41:49,858
times it's for the better but it's

1271
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:51,119
something to be aware of yeah 100 same

1272
00:41:49,858 --> 00:41:52,139
thing with the cover crops and you know

1273
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:54,358
if you're chopping and dropping your

1274
00:41:52,139 --> 00:41:55,139
cover crops you know seven weeks in the

1275
00:41:54,358 --> 00:41:56,598
flour

1276
00:41:55,139 --> 00:41:58,858
um you then create some microbial

1277
00:41:56,599 --> 00:42:00,539
explosion in your soil some nutrient

1278
00:41:58,858 --> 00:42:02,460
cycling is going to take place um it

1279
00:42:00,539 --> 00:42:03,719
might be counter unproductive to what

1280
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:06,480
you're trying to achieve as far as

1281
00:42:03,719 --> 00:42:08,399
growing a good taste in plants so uh

1282
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:10,320
yeah 100

1283
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:12,838
yeah well I've heard I haven't I've

1284
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:15,539
never tried uh glp flour but everyone

1285
00:42:12,838 --> 00:42:17,940
I've talked to that has tried it says

1286
00:42:15,539 --> 00:42:20,279
that it is it's top shelf and it's great

1287
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:22,019
stuff so uh yeah hats off to you and

1288
