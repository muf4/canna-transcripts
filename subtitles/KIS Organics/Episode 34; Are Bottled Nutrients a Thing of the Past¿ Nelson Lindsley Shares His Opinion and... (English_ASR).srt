science podcast

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,149
I'm your host tad hussy of KISS organics

5
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:26,070
this is the podcast where we discussed

6
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:28,079
the cutting edge of organic growing from

7
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:30,179
a science-based perspective and drawn

8
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:32,070
top experts from around the industry to

9
00:00:30,178 --> 00:00:34,229
share their wisdom and knowledge our

10
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:36,000
guest today is Nelson Lindsley of poetry

11
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:38,789
of plants you can check him out on

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,590
instagram under poetry of plants Nelson

13
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:42,359
has been cultivating cannabis for over a

14
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,850
decade and working in the industry for

15
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:46,859
over two decades over the last three

16
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,399
years he has consulted on cultivation

17
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:52,259
sites in Washington Oregon Colorado

18
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:53,820
Pennsylvania and California Nelson has

19
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:55,920
been on the podcast before it is a

20
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,210
popular guest I wanted to get him back

21
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,309
on here to talk about an upcoming

22
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,870
project we are working on as well as

23
00:00:59,308 --> 00:01:02,729
cover a range of topics ranging from

24
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:05,609
bottled nutrients so I'm excited to have

25
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:07,590
you back on the show to talk about well

26
00:01:05,609 --> 00:01:09,450
a few different things so let's start

27
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:11,909
off telling listeners a little bit about

28
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:14,070
our new project sure can you can you

29
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:16,979
tell them about the dope history podcast

30
00:01:14,069 --> 00:01:20,250
and what that really is all about yeah I

31
00:01:16,978 --> 00:01:23,280
can the dope history podcast is going to

32
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:26,040
be a collection of narratives from

33
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:29,700
individuals that have been in the

34
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:32,700
cannabis community in cannabis world for

35
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:35,150
the last what 30 40 years all inclusive

36
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:37,680
so what we're doing is highlighting

37
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:39,960
particular journeys and narratives of

38
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:44,520
individuals that have built the

39
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:47,399
foundation for the cannabis market that

40
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:49,349
we have today so Nelson I will be

41
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:51,930
co-hosting this it's gonna be called the

42
00:01:49,349 --> 00:01:53,879
dope history podcast you can go to dope

43
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:56,729
history com2 check it out and I'll have

44
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:58,679
all the information coming out on with

45
00:01:56,728 --> 00:02:00,899
links on the podcast page for this

46
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,219
podcast but this is purely a labor of

47
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:04,900
love it's something that we're both

48
00:02:02,218 --> 00:02:06,939
really excited about doing together as

49
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:09,909
project just to share some of these

50
00:02:06,939 --> 00:02:11,560
really really amazing stories so our

51
00:02:09,909 --> 00:02:13,449
hope is people while they're you know

52
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,280
working in their room or sitting back

53
00:02:13,449 --> 00:02:16,869
having a joint they can just hear some

54
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,129
of the history around this plant and

55
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,840
some of the things that people have gone

56
00:02:18,129 --> 00:02:22,269
through to get us to where we are today

57
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,430
great story like if there was a campfire

58
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:28,870
it would be perfect but we can't do that

59
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:29,170
digitally right yeah for sure there you

60
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,789
go

61
00:02:29,169 --> 00:02:35,409
so just something something to chill

62
00:02:30,789 --> 00:02:36,939
listen to and kind of understand what

63
00:02:35,409 --> 00:02:40,000
we've gone through with this plant and

64
00:02:36,939 --> 00:02:42,819
our culture and and some of the laws and

65
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,419
the way you know some people have given

66
00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:49,750
up so much or gained so much by

67
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:51,069
cultivating or transporting or being

68
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:53,409
related to this plant somehow

69
00:02:51,069 --> 00:02:56,199
spiritually connected yeah I mean we

70
00:02:53,409 --> 00:02:59,250
have stories on there from my guys that

71
00:02:56,199 --> 00:03:02,439
were kicking it in the 70s and 80s and

72
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:07,300
some pretty amazing stories a lot of the

73
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:09,430
history of you know the psychedelic

74
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,180
movement even you know and and where all

75
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:13,680
that came from

76
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:15,489
on earth it's pretty wild awesome well

77
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,349
let's not give it all away

78
00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:20,259
so all right they're gonna have to check

79
00:03:17,349 --> 00:03:21,759
out the podcast so let's get into this

80
00:03:20,259 --> 00:03:24,370
podcast though I'm excited to have you

81
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:26,439
back John and thanks for having me I was

82
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:28,360
trying to think of topics cuz you and I

83
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:30,370
have conversations all the time and they

84
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,840
just ramble on and they all seem pretty

85
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:33,580
interesting to me but I was trying to

86
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,719
think what what could we focus on today

87
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:40,120
and one question I wanted to ask you was

88
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:42,849
do you think bottled nutrients are still

89
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,769
relevant today are they something you

90
00:03:42,849 --> 00:03:48,849
know within the cannabis industry that

91
00:03:44,769 --> 00:03:50,830
are maybe a sort of a dinosaur and in

92
00:03:48,849 --> 00:03:52,780
some respects or do you think that

93
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:57,670
they're improving and really are the

94
00:03:52,780 --> 00:04:00,849
future of cannabis cultivation so you

95
00:03:57,669 --> 00:04:05,259
the I'm gonna throw a curveball and I'm

96
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:07,329
gonna say mmm maybe maybe not and I'm

97
00:04:05,259 --> 00:04:08,289
gonna say that because number one I'm

98
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:10,480
not a chemist

99
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:14,439
number two I'm learning more about the

100
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:16,608
formulations and what I'm so if we're

101
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:18,439
talking about

102
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:20,388
we'll talk about the synthetic type

103
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:23,209
fertilizers right because it's - it's

104
00:04:20,389 --> 00:04:27,530
almost two different worlds for organic

105
00:04:23,209 --> 00:04:29,418
inputs you know what would you can local

106
00:04:27,529 --> 00:04:32,269
side note is the fish hydrolysis

107
00:04:29,418 --> 00:04:34,818
considered a bottled nutrient I don't

108
00:04:32,269 --> 00:04:36,378
know that's a good question I write it's

109
00:04:34,819 --> 00:04:39,620
not it's not a big not buying a brand

110
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:42,229
though you're buying a product so I

111
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:44,870
would say no that would be like saying

112
00:04:42,228 --> 00:04:47,839
you know ammonium nitrate is a bottle of

113
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:51,259
nutrient well I think we're talking

114
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:52,810
about a delivery system right is it and

115
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:55,490
if we're talking about a delivery system

116
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:58,250
we're saying a bottled nutrient is the

117
00:04:55,490 --> 00:05:00,379
fertilizer mix with water and so we're

118
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:02,089
we've credits you know a lot of people

119
00:05:00,379 --> 00:05:04,279
well we've talked about it you know

120
00:05:02,089 --> 00:05:08,598
buying water shipping water doesn't make

121
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:11,089
a lot of sense you know economically or

122
00:05:08,598 --> 00:05:13,579
operationally but what I've learned is

123
00:05:11,089 --> 00:05:17,049
that it's with synthetic nutrients if

124
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:20,598
you are gonna be super anal and exact

125
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:22,579
about your percentages sometimes you

126
00:05:20,598 --> 00:05:24,468
have to have it pre-mixed by an actual

127
00:05:22,579 --> 00:05:27,519
chemist to get it a hundred percent

128
00:05:24,468 --> 00:05:29,478
accurate is that needed for production

129
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:31,908
not really

130
00:05:29,478 --> 00:05:33,800
I don't think so some people some people

131
00:05:31,908 --> 00:05:36,918
think so some people want it to be

132
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:39,620
perfect and what I've learned when

133
00:05:36,918 --> 00:05:42,139
you're scooping out your water-soluble

134
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:44,509
blends bag of fertilizer is that every

135
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:48,829
single one of those minerals has its own

136
00:05:44,509 --> 00:05:52,639
specific weight and how that bag of

137
00:05:48,829 --> 00:05:54,579
fertilizer is mixed up and then when

138
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,939
you're scooping it into your reservoir

139
00:05:54,579 --> 00:06:00,439
you may or may not be getting the actual

140
00:05:57,939 --> 00:06:02,360
correct combination of minerals that you

141
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:05,180
think you are based on how you're

142
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:07,250
scooping and how you're measuring so

143
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:09,560
that's where the little caveat to all of

144
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:12,769
it is so if it's being blended for you

145
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:15,019
beforehand you know exactly how much

146
00:06:12,769 --> 00:06:17,028
calcium how much magnesium how much iron

147
00:06:15,019 --> 00:06:19,639
and that's all done by weight by the

148
00:06:17,028 --> 00:06:23,360
chemist into the bottle nutrient now I

149
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:25,639
do not think that most bottled

150
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:29,598
fertilizer companies cannabis fertilizer

151
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:30,480
companies are I mean I might get in

152
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:32,279
trouble for saying this but

153
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:37,050
don't think that they're really going to

154
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:39,689
that level of detail when they're making

155
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:41,610
their fertilizers just because I've run

156
00:06:39,689 --> 00:06:42,930
tests on it and I've you know I'm not

157
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:45,660
gonna name any names and we talked about

158
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:47,519
this before but I've seen wide variety

159
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:49,170
wide ranges of differences in the

160
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:52,349
minimum and maximum of the fertilizer

161
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:54,449
levels so are those products those

162
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:57,540
perfected bottled nutrient products out

163
00:06:54,449 --> 00:06:58,800
there I don't know I haven't really seen

164
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:01,080
it I know that there's some companies

165
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:04,259
that are working on getting better at

166
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:07,490
that but for right now I would still

167
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:09,810
lean more towards the water soluble

168
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:12,120
fertilizers although there are some

169
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:14,220
associates of mine who are having their

170
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:19,340
fertilizers mixed by some specialists

171
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:22,770
and are working on creating you know the

172
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:27,329
perfect cannabis fertilizer whatever

173
00:07:22,769 --> 00:07:31,589
that is so is our bottled nutrients dead

174
00:07:27,329 --> 00:07:33,750
I think in this current iteration yes I

175
00:07:31,589 --> 00:07:36,239
think there's room for something else to

176
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:39,120
come out of it but I don't know if it's

177
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,639
going to make sense at scale does that

178
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,319
answer your question yeah it was a bit

179
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:45,750
of a loaded question I'll be honest I

180
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:48,060
mean I've been a pretty loud critic of

181
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:50,910
bottled nutrients in general for quite a

182
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:53,879
while now trying to get growers to just

183
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:56,189
read the label and then look at the

184
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:59,370
ingredients and sort of formulate their

185
00:07:56,189 --> 00:08:02,519
own now that being said when we talk

186
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:05,269
about synthetic nutrients and some of

187
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:08,490
the aspects yes we do need to

188
00:08:05,269 --> 00:08:10,560
continually feed the plant nutrients we

189
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:13,110
can't expect all of our nutrients to be

190
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:16,439
in the media and you know even as

191
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:19,080
someone who sells living soils and water

192
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:20,939
only soils I do think there is benefit

193
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:22,589
to continual feeding I think that the

194
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:24,060
plant will actually thrive and do a

195
00:08:22,589 --> 00:08:25,409
little bit better if you are able to

196
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:28,410
give it a little bit of nutrients

197
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:31,080
throughout the cycle but that being said

198
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:33,450
I think we give bottled nutrient

199
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:36,720
companies way too much credit in terms

200
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:41,490
of you know quota QC and quality control

201
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:43,410
and the innovation that went into the

202
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:44,340
products that they're creating I think a

203
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:46,110
lot more money

204
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:48,030
time probably went into their branding

205
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:51,560
than it did in to the actual formulation

206
00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:54,439
of the product in a lot of cases I agree

207
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:57,839
well can I want to say one thing about

208
00:08:54,440 --> 00:09:00,120
just a little side note so I've got I've

209
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:02,519
I finally had the opportunity now that I

210
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:07,799
moved out of LA to grow some plants

211
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:11,789
outside and I for my indoor plants I

212
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:15,629
still use the synthetic blend and and I

213
00:09:11,789 --> 00:09:17,490
add my organics in but outside I do not

214
00:09:15,629 --> 00:09:19,470
use any bottled nutrients at all anymore

215
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:22,259
I just I've used some of your soil which

216
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:25,259
has been fantastic and I'll make a

217
00:09:22,259 --> 00:09:28,740
mended soil and I just feed of water and

218
00:09:25,259 --> 00:09:31,169
I have gotten to the point where it's so

219
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:33,210
much easier just to do it that way and

220
00:09:31,169 --> 00:09:36,360
the product that comes out and the

221
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:38,970
health of the planet is better than

222
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:42,360
ninety percent of anything that I grow

223
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:44,220
indoors and there's so very little that

224
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,320
I have to do I just have to you know

225
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:49,410
have a nice soil blend that has the

226
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,540
right proper fertility and you know I

227
00:09:49,409 --> 00:09:53,639
talked to coot the other day and dude

228
00:09:51,539 --> 00:09:55,980
turned me on to a couple little things I

229
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:58,350
can add into the soil and it's just been

230
00:09:55,980 --> 00:10:01,350
amazing to see what you can do without

231
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:03,690
having to go to a synthetic fertilizer

232
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:06,659
and I would more you know say that I'm

233
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:12,210
I'm moving into this place where the all

234
00:10:06,659 --> 00:10:14,909
natural Sun grown there's just a joy to

235
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:17,310
it where you know I don't have to be

236
00:10:14,909 --> 00:10:19,860
screwing around pH meters EC meters and

237
00:10:17,309 --> 00:10:23,759
all of that and it's it's just easier

238
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:25,820
and I have less problems why is that

239
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:28,529
different under the Sun in the light

240
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:29,850
indoor light artificial light I think it

241
00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:33,179
has to do with power of the way this

242
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:34,440
this planet was was built just a little

243
00:10:33,179 --> 00:10:35,609
side note on that because I don't think

244
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,830
we've talked about the fact that I've

245
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:39,570
been moving away

246
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:41,310
you know I am almost looking at indoor

247
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:43,080
cultivation now I mean there's a lot of

248
00:10:41,309 --> 00:10:44,849
indoor cultivation but a moment was

249
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:48,259
looking at an indoor cultivation is more

250
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:50,610
of an RD space and less of a space for

251
00:10:48,259 --> 00:10:53,000
commercial production just because how

252
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:55,019
much easier it is to be growing outside

253
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,710
well that makes sense where you're

254
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:59,840
located down in California but up here

255
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:01,550
Washington especially in Western

256
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:03,470
Washington near Seattle we just don't

257
00:11:01,549 --> 00:11:05,389
have the weather it's really you're

258
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:07,120
rolling the dice as to whether or not

259
00:11:05,389 --> 00:11:09,799
your plants will actually finish

260
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:13,610
depending on how the weather is come

261
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:16,699
October so maybe you know maybe moving

262
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:21,710
towards you know Auto flowers is a

263
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:23,180
solution to some of that but yeah I hear

264
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:25,550
what you're saying I mean outdoor is

265
00:11:23,179 --> 00:11:26,989
great it does bring up other challenges

266
00:11:25,549 --> 00:11:29,179
like the weather and you don't have the

267
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:32,360
same levels of control but you do get

268
00:11:29,179 --> 00:11:35,449
all the benefit of unlimited root space

269
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:37,000
and beneficial and predatory insects

270
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:39,710
just naturalizing in your environment

271
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,740
there's in sunlight like there's a ton

272
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:45,050
of benefits to it for sure I'm still I'm

273
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:45,710
still putting the plants in pots I mean

274
00:11:45,049 --> 00:11:48,979
forgive me

275
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:52,280
so I'm still making my own soil you know

276
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:54,860
working on the you know I've got some

277
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:57,740
hemp plants in the ground and that's

278
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:59,240
been going well but I still like I still

279
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:00,950
am leaning towards growing cannabis and

280
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:03,019
pots so I can control the amount of

281
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:06,020
amendments that are actually in the

282
00:12:03,019 --> 00:12:08,000
substrate oh man see I'm I'm the total

283
00:12:06,019 --> 00:12:12,319
opposite I will put a plant in the

284
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,879
ground 99% of the time the only times I

285
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:17,000
don't recommend going into the ground

286
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:18,409
are if you have really bad moles and

287
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,350
foals or things that are gonna eat the

288
00:12:18,409 --> 00:12:23,629
roots and kill your plant that way or if

289
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:26,470
you're in a floodplain where your water

290
00:12:23,629 --> 00:12:28,970
table is so high that it's an issue but

291
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:30,980
from coming from a nursery background

292
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:33,680
growing up on a plant nursery with my

293
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:35,420
parents you take two plants and you put

294
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:37,989
one plant in a container and you put one

295
00:12:35,419 --> 00:12:42,529
plant in the ground even if the ground

296
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:44,330
soil is somewhat subpar that that plant

297
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:46,789
in the ground is gonna outperform the

298
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:49,490
plant in the container 99% of the time

299
00:12:46,789 --> 00:12:51,740
it's amazing for some of the reasons I

300
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:54,440
just listed you know I would love to see

301
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:55,820
you do an experiment take two plants you

302
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,920
know you don't even have to do a soil

303
00:12:55,820 --> 00:13:00,560
test of your soil I mean I don't know a

304
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:02,089
lot about your soil but my guess is if

305
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:04,639
you put one in the ground and put that

306
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:07,100
same you know it's another clone in good

307
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,480
soil shoot put it in our soil and run

308
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:11,710
them side by side and see how it

309
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:16,180
compares yeah I mean

310
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:16,180
that makes all the sense in the world

311
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:20,870
and not just what that just has to do

312
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:22,909
with the amount that the roots can grow

313
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:25,490
right there's no limit limiting factor

314
00:13:22,909 --> 00:13:26,929
yeah root space isn't like you said

315
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:30,129
isn't a limiting factor

316
00:13:26,929 --> 00:13:32,569
inaudible environment yeah the the soil

317
00:13:30,129 --> 00:13:35,330
typically has you know pretty good

318
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:37,990
microbial life you're gonna have it's

319
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:40,540
gonna have more soil structure and

320
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:44,149
there's just there's a lot we don't know

321
00:13:40,539 --> 00:13:47,059
honestly going on there too but in

322
00:13:44,149 --> 00:13:49,250
general you know like I have mulberry

323
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:51,259
trees at my farm and I have some in

324
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:53,330
containers that have you know been root

325
00:13:51,259 --> 00:13:55,159
BAM now that are probably 2 feet tall

326
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:58,070
and I have the same mulberry tree in the

327
00:13:55,159 --> 00:14:00,740
chicken yard that is now 15 feet tall

328
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:03,950
and part of that is because we have it

329
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:06,409
up potted our mulberries appropriately

330
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:07,910
to get them to the size they want but a

331
00:14:06,409 --> 00:14:09,829
lot of it too is once we put that plant

332
00:14:07,909 --> 00:14:11,629
in the ground and just it just took off

333
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:14,060
and waterings another thing there too

334
00:14:11,629 --> 00:14:15,470
because when you're in the ground you

335
00:14:14,059 --> 00:14:19,009
don't you don't need to water as much

336
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:21,080
you sort of have a natural mulch the

337
00:14:19,009 --> 00:14:22,490
plants able to pull up water out of the

338
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:24,379
soil a lot more efficiently than they

339
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:27,110
can out of container so a lot of

340
00:14:24,379 --> 00:14:30,169
benefits even an even a clone because

341
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:32,000
the clone is lacking a taproot well yeah

342
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:33,829
all everything I'm saying is under the

343
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,799
caveat that once once the plant is

344
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:37,730
established understood yeah that's

345
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:41,000
that's a good point

346
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:43,220
now since we're talking about sort of

347
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,899
random things I kind of wanted to change

348
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:47,540
directions one of the things that you

349
00:14:44,899 --> 00:14:51,740
posted on your Instagram a while back

350
00:14:47,539 --> 00:14:53,990
related to flushing and yeah and organic

351
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:55,940
plants do you want to kind of summarize

352
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:57,919
how that discussion went and sort of

353
00:14:55,940 --> 00:15:00,250
what what your thoughts on it because I

354
00:14:57,919 --> 00:15:05,779
think we have a similar view I mean it's

355
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:09,019
yeah I just you know all everyone's been

356
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:13,879
flushing cannabis that I know for the

357
00:15:09,019 --> 00:15:18,789
last seven to 14 days of the life of the

358
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:21,799
plant so prior to harvest practices to

359
00:15:18,789 --> 00:15:23,269
deprive the plan of nutrients and just

360
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:26,389
give it water

361
00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:30,079
and the thought behind that was that it

362
00:15:26,389 --> 00:15:33,740
created a better quality product because

363
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:37,220
you were flushing out the nutrients out

364
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:39,980
of the plant and I here you know I'll go

365
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:42,500
online and I see a lot of people talking

366
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:43,940
about that and it just didn't make it

367
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:46,759
didn't make sense like I didn't

368
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:49,640
understand how you could how pouring

369
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:53,360
water into the plant would remove the

370
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:56,299
nutrients it with that mode of action so

371
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:59,659
the way that it was being described and

372
00:15:56,299 --> 00:16:03,349
talked about seemed to be incorrect to

373
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:04,909
me and so I put a couple posts up

374
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:07,700
actually was a repost for another guy

375
00:16:04,909 --> 00:16:10,939
that had a very excellent description of

376
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:12,440
what actually was going on and I

377
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:14,060
suggested that we stop calling it

378
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:16,610
flushing the plan started calling it

379
00:16:14,059 --> 00:16:20,419
starving the plant and that's you know

380
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:22,220
removing the fertilizer you know then

381
00:16:20,419 --> 00:16:24,169
you've got various things that happen

382
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:27,050
and the plant starts using its stores of

383
00:16:24,169 --> 00:16:28,879
energy and you know you start getting

384
00:16:27,049 --> 00:16:30,949
nutrient deficiencies essentially is

385
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:33,110
what it is what it really looks like and

386
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:34,910
in that deficiency there's I think

387
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:37,909
there's a stress response that happens

388
00:16:34,909 --> 00:16:40,730
that may increase the cannabinoid

389
00:16:37,909 --> 00:16:43,339
content and terpene content as a defense

390
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:45,769
mechanism or as the death throes of the

391
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:47,750
plant as it's realizing it's not getting

392
00:16:45,769 --> 00:16:50,120
anymore food it's you know kind of ended

393
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:52,370
at the end of its reproductive cycle and

394
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:54,740
that's what's actually creating the

395
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:59,330
increase in quality a lot of people talk

396
00:16:54,740 --> 00:17:01,159
about it having a taste you know that if

397
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:05,059
you don't flush that you're gonna get a

398
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:08,180
poor poor tasting product on the smoke

399
00:17:05,059 --> 00:17:10,039
and I don't know if that's the direct

400
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:12,380
result of it either people discuss about

401
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:13,909
chlorophyll like you're flushing out the

402
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:16,220
chlorophyll that doesn't make sense to

403
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:18,950
me and it just seemed like there was a

404
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:20,660
scientific brat an unscientific practice

405
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:24,740
being put into place and being claimed

406
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:26,330
as a scientific practice do I understand

407
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:28,370
everything that's going on when we flush

408
00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:31,939
the plant at this moment no I'm still

409
00:17:28,369 --> 00:17:35,719
learning and figuring all that out as I

410
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:37,130
you know go talk to other you know PhDs

411
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,809
and people that know a lot more about

412
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:40,670
culture than I do and I talked to them

413
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:42,829
about this flushing the plant thing they

414
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:44,120
just kind of chuckled and laugh and say

415
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:46,210
what are you talking about they've never

416
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:48,799
even heard of that before

417
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:50,720
and I don't have to explain to them

418
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:53,960
what's going on and and then they have

419
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,430
to decipher what I what the common

420
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,860
understanding of it is to what's

421
00:17:55,430 --> 00:18:01,460
actually happening and there hasn't been

422
00:17:57,859 --> 00:18:03,829
a ton of research done on flushing the

423
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:05,360
plant just because there aren't a lot of

424
00:18:03,829 --> 00:18:07,399
other industries that do that there

425
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:09,500
aren't a lot of agricultural crops where

426
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:11,870
they're actually flushing the plant now

427
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:14,410
one thing I will say on that is cannabis

428
00:18:11,869 --> 00:18:19,909
is an amazing bio accumulator of

429
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:22,850
chemicals and minerals so perhaps giving

430
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:24,470
it that water allows the can of cannabis

431
00:18:22,849 --> 00:18:26,179
plant to release something that they

432
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:28,240
viable accumulated that could affect the

433
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:31,789
quality that would be the only thing

434
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:33,140
that I could think of that would that

435
00:18:31,789 --> 00:18:36,950
would support this quote unquote

436
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:41,480
flushing terminology so here's my take

437
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:42,319
on it now one thing especially in you

438
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:45,829
know when you're growing in mineral

439
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:48,859
salts is you can have a buildup of salt

440
00:18:45,829 --> 00:18:52,129
content in your media and you can also

441
00:18:48,859 --> 00:18:54,409
have excess nitrates in your media and I

442
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:56,360
think that by removing those by flushing

443
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:58,880
the plant or you know removing them out

444
00:18:56,359 --> 00:19:01,369
of the media by adding excessive water

445
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,830
you can improve the quality of your

446
00:19:01,369 --> 00:19:06,169
final product so I think there's a few

447
00:19:03,829 --> 00:19:08,210
things going on now in organic soil you

448
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:10,130
don't have a bunch of ionic nutrients

449
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:12,440
just hanging out in the media and you

450
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:14,570
typically don't have a buildup of salt

451
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:17,799
content so it doesn't really make sense

452
00:19:14,569 --> 00:19:20,480
to flush your plant for the same reasons

453
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:24,710
there's no there's no excess nitrates to

454
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:26,420
remove but that being said does as you

455
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:28,160
said you know starving or stressing your

456
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:29,300
plant create a stress response that

457
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:34,340
somehow we're going to improve the

458
00:19:29,299 --> 00:19:37,009
quality of the final bud well maybe but

459
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:38,659
I you know I've seen a lot of great

460
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:41,089
organic growers that don't flush their

461
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:42,980
plants that have produced really really

462
00:19:41,089 --> 00:19:44,359
good high-quality you know what I would

463
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:48,620
consider top-shelf cannabis and

464
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:50,629
top-shelf flowers so I to me of what

465
00:19:48,619 --> 00:19:51,179
flushing is a bit of a myth now if we

466
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:54,210
want to

467
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:58,980
are looking at creating stress responses

468
00:19:54,210 --> 00:20:01,799
in cannabis plants at various stages of

469
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:04,259
growth and how that may affect you know

470
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:06,599
cannabinoid levels or turkey and content

471
00:20:04,259 --> 00:20:09,180
in the plant itself I think that is

472
00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:11,189
something that we can study using

473
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:13,170
science and research but I don't think

474
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:14,789
that flushing is really the right like

475
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:17,670
you said the right terminology or really

476
00:20:14,789 --> 00:20:20,369
what's what we what we want to do with a

477
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:22,050
plant I would challenge people to go

478
00:20:20,369 --> 00:20:24,059
ahead and if you are growing an organic

479
00:20:22,049 --> 00:20:27,299
soil go ahead and try flushing one plant

480
00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:29,490
and see compare the final the final

481
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:32,669
flower and I don't think you'll see an

482
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:34,410
improvement personally but that's that's

483
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:36,630
my take how do you flush your own

484
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:39,540
organic and organic I mean you're not

485
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:41,040
really when you're feeding are you

486
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:43,649
talking about feeding the plant organic

487
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:45,569
inputs through a solution or any

488
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:49,470
organics because when I have an organic

489
00:20:45,569 --> 00:20:51,179
soil I'm very rarely feeding it you know

490
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:52,980
any kind of fertilizers a solution all

491
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:55,289
of its kind of art either mixed into the

492
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:56,880
soil or top trust so how do you how

493
00:20:55,289 --> 00:20:58,200
would you flush or that's what I don't

494
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,170
understand how would you flush an

495
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:03,690
organic plant and I can get that if you

496
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:05,759
have like a pretty fairly inert low ecc

497
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:07,440
substrate and then you're trying to

498
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:08,759
flush out or purge those nitrates I

499
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,160
still don't understand how that affects

500
00:21:08,759 --> 00:21:13,680
the taste I don't understand how that

501
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:15,390
works when people make those claims but

502
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:17,940
how would you flush an organic plant

503
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:21,830
well so here's the argument as I

504
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:25,650
understand it so if you want to take a

505
00:21:21,829 --> 00:21:27,869
media soilless media that is potentially

506
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:30,390
high in nitrates and you remove those

507
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:32,639
nitrates by adding a lot of water that

508
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:35,130
plant is going to have less nitrogen to

509
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,600
take up therefore it's going to have

510
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:39,740
less chlorophyll production and

511
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:42,659
therefore it's gonna have less green

512
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:44,849
less green in its leaves and potentially

513
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:46,740
maybe have less chlorophyll overall when

514
00:21:44,849 --> 00:21:49,500
you smoke it I guess that would be my

515
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:51,089
take on that from an organic soil

516
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:54,420
perspective you're right you're there's

517
00:21:51,089 --> 00:21:57,089
amendments being added or ingredients in

518
00:21:54,420 --> 00:22:00,210
terms of nitrogen that's not in a plant

519
00:21:57,089 --> 00:22:02,369
available form and so that has to be

520
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:04,170
processed by the microbiology and the

521
00:22:02,369 --> 00:22:08,339
soil into

522
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:10,320
nitrate or into ammonium but essentially

523
00:22:08,339 --> 00:22:12,299
that may be what some of that may be

524
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:15,990
washed out through a flushing process

525
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:17,819
but it's it's not at excessive levels in

526
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:20,069
general now from a farming perspective

527
00:22:17,819 --> 00:22:21,450
and agriculturally you always add

528
00:22:20,069 --> 00:22:23,039
nitrogen in the spring because of the

529
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:24,900
heavy rains that you get will flush it

530
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:27,029
out of your system so they don't even

531
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:28,680
test for nitrogen and a lot of times on

532
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:30,389
the soil tests because they just assume

533
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:33,180
that your soil is going to be deficient

534
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:35,100
now that's when we start when we're

535
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:37,560
talking about agricultural land now we

536
00:22:35,099 --> 00:22:40,230
talked about soilless media indoors when

537
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:43,259
we're not getting that excessive water

538
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:45,390
addition we could have a lot of we could

539
00:22:43,259 --> 00:22:49,049
potentially have too much nitrogen or

540
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:52,080
too many nitrogen amendments so there is

541
00:22:49,049 --> 00:22:53,490
a balance there I guess but it's not

542
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:56,579
something that I think you're correcting

543
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:57,839
with the last week or 14 days of your

544
00:22:56,579 --> 00:22:59,639
plant's life it's something that you

545
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:02,789
need to be managing throughout the

546
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:06,509
entire grow cycle as you sort of balance

547
00:23:02,789 --> 00:23:09,960
and manage your soil yeah I'll I'll use

548
00:23:06,509 --> 00:23:11,879
flushing if my if let's say I have too

549
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:16,230
much of a dry down period on my medium

550
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:19,230
the EC is gonna climb and that mine

551
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:21,299
might not be suitable for bird whatever

552
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:23,009
stage of growth the plants in so

553
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:24,720
there'll be times if I made a boo-boo or

554
00:23:23,009 --> 00:23:28,799
I made a mistake and I've got to correct

555
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:30,799
that and I use flushing to you know

556
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:34,169
clean out the medium and kind of reset

557
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:36,269
the medium for proper plant growth but

558
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:37,800
I'll still flush with a small amount of

559
00:23:36,269 --> 00:23:39,000
fertilizer because I'm not trying to

560
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:42,149
starve the plant in the middle of its

561
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,640
cycle just to kind of get it back into

562
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:47,940
balance so well I will use that practice

563
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:50,280
but at the end I you know at the end of

564
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:52,289
the cycle I've mean I've done I've done

565
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:54,059
it where I flushed it 14 I've flushed I

566
00:23:52,289 --> 00:23:55,440
flushed a lot you know thinking that

567
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:56,909
this is what you're supposed to do and

568
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,880
that this is gonna create quality flower

569
00:23:56,910 --> 00:24:02,279
and about two years ago I started to

570
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:04,440
slowly bring down the amount of days

571
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:05,819
that I would give it water because and I

572
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,980
might you know what I'm gonna cut this

573
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:09,509
down when it's ready and I'm not gonna

574
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:12,539
starve it until I think it's ready

575
00:24:09,509 --> 00:24:14,099
and I'm at a point now where I'll give

576
00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:16,440
it water for two or three days and cut

577
00:24:14,099 --> 00:24:17,649
it down and and I don't notice and no

578
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,900
one else who uses the

579
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:23,970
flower notices that it tastes funny or

580
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:26,860
has too much of you know some residual

581
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:28,480
something or other in it and I think

582
00:24:26,859 --> 00:24:31,089
that the taste issue has more do

583
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:34,720
properly drying the product and allowing

584
00:24:31,089 --> 00:24:36,519
it to cure is what I you know in in the

585
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,319
ash burning you know a lot of people say

586
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:41,529
well the ash is burning black that means

587
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:43,929
it wasn't flushed well I don't that

588
00:24:41,529 --> 00:24:46,839
doesn't make any sense to me if the ash

589
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:49,600
is burning black it's either too too wet

590
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:51,939
or there's some other chemical that was

591
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:55,809
sprayed on it that's my thought on it

592
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:58,360
what do you think I am NOT a cannabis

593
00:24:55,809 --> 00:25:00,759
consumption expert so I'm gonna not

594
00:24:58,359 --> 00:25:02,559
weigh in on that one okay got it

595
00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:04,900
have you heard have you heard that

596
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:06,490
conversation before I have I have but I

597
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:09,009
don't have enough experience honestly

598
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:10,660
like I know coot for example will tell

599
00:25:09,009 --> 00:25:13,000
you that anything that was grown with

600
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:15,370
chemicals to him tastes like a burned up

601
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,859
rubber tire and he can just tell right

602
00:25:15,369 --> 00:25:20,289
away if it was grown using mineral salts

603
00:25:17,859 --> 00:25:22,990
I don't claim to have any level of

604
00:25:20,289 --> 00:25:25,720
sophistication around well frankly

605
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:27,579
anything wine or cannabis as much as I

606
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:30,940
wish I had a better palate I just I

607
00:25:27,579 --> 00:25:32,859
really don't so I'm gonna stay out of

608
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:34,750
that one but one thing I did want to

609
00:25:32,859 --> 00:25:37,269
bring up relating to flushing before we

610
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:39,700
move on to the next topic is some of the

611
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:42,279
concerns around it too so when we stress

612
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:43,960
our plant we may get a good stress

613
00:25:42,279 --> 00:25:46,839
response but we're also opening it up to

614
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:48,940
more pest pressure we're increasing the

615
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:50,769
humidity in our rooms potentially which

616
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:53,350
can lead to more chanting you know more

617
00:25:50,769 --> 00:25:57,309
opportunity for certain fungal pathogens

618
00:25:53,349 --> 00:25:59,230
like botrytis or powdery mildew so these

619
00:25:57,309 --> 00:26:01,899
are some of the dangers I guess or

620
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:04,000
concerns around excessive watering or

621
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:08,080
any sort of any sort of practice that's

622
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,660
gonna create a stress response yeah I

623
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:13,179
wouldn't I wouldn't say that you would

624
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:14,040
be watering more often if you were

625
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:18,279
flushing

626
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:22,539
you don't want to you know drown the

627
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:24,759
roots right so III don't think that your

628
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:27,519
your latent load which is the amount of

629
00:26:24,759 --> 00:26:29,250
water that's in the air or the

630
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:31,579
transpiration the water that's being

631
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:33,019
transpired by the plant should go

632
00:26:31,579 --> 00:26:35,569
whether you're flushing or giving it

633
00:26:33,019 --> 00:26:39,200
just a regular solution for the last two

634
00:26:35,569 --> 00:26:40,939
weeks I would say that the any stress

635
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,850
response at the end of a cycle if you

636
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:46,820
have an unstable genetic it could cause

637
00:26:43,849 --> 00:26:48,798
the plant to hermaphrodite which is what

638
00:26:46,819 --> 00:26:50,628
I see often is is flushing the plant

639
00:26:48,798 --> 00:26:54,710
caused the plant to hermaphrodite I

640
00:26:50,628 --> 00:26:57,109
don't know Minoo that I we have a lot of

641
00:26:54,710 --> 00:27:02,889
unstable genetics on the market right

642
00:26:57,109 --> 00:27:07,928
now and you know one one faux-pas can

643
00:27:02,888 --> 00:27:10,638
create banana pollen sacks you know so I

644
00:27:07,929 --> 00:27:14,109
I would yeah would suggest everyone do a

645
00:27:10,638 --> 00:27:16,668
trial like you said but with whatever

646
00:27:14,108 --> 00:27:19,398
methodology they're using try flushing

647
00:27:16,669 --> 00:27:21,739
in in on one or two plants and try not

648
00:27:19,398 --> 00:27:25,028
watching on one or two plants and really

649
00:27:21,739 --> 00:27:28,940
give it a fair you know blind taste test

650
00:27:25,028 --> 00:27:31,159
or an analysis so one thing that you

651
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:34,038
mentioned a little bit ago we're talking

652
00:27:31,159 --> 00:27:36,440
about outdoor plants was not using your

653
00:27:34,038 --> 00:27:38,989
EC or pH meter anymore on your outdoor

654
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:42,440
plants and there's a reach recent

655
00:27:38,989 --> 00:27:45,499
discussion online about whether or not

656
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:48,139
you need to ever pH your water if you're

657
00:27:45,499 --> 00:27:51,679
growing organically or with organic soil

658
00:27:48,138 --> 00:27:54,138
and I have a pretty strong opinion on

659
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:56,298
this but I was gonna let you go first

660
00:27:54,138 --> 00:27:59,209
if there's any you have any thoughts on

661
00:27:56,298 --> 00:28:01,548
the subject or I'm happy to chime in and

662
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:02,720
start the discussion yeah I think the

663
00:28:01,548 --> 00:28:05,388
first thing you need to do is check your

664
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:07,489
before your feeding your plants any of

665
00:28:05,388 --> 00:28:09,319
your water you need to check you know

666
00:28:07,489 --> 00:28:12,440
get a water test done and make sure that

667
00:28:09,319 --> 00:28:14,450
it's suitable for plant health you know

668
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:18,980
I lived in LA for a while and sometimes

669
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:21,230
the pH was all over the map and not

670
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:23,569
within that suitable for growth range

671
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:26,298
which you know from how I understand it

672
00:28:23,569 --> 00:28:29,569
is somewhere between you know five five

673
00:28:26,298 --> 00:28:32,470
and seven five so if it's around there I

674
00:28:29,569 --> 00:28:35,329
don't know if it's that important

675
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:39,679
because the soil will do a lot of the pH

676
00:28:35,329 --> 00:28:42,138
buffering for you so you know indoors

677
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:44,149
it's a little bit more it's a little

678
00:28:42,138 --> 00:28:45,148
trickier when you're especially when

679
00:28:44,148 --> 00:28:47,189
you're dealing with

680
00:28:45,148 --> 00:28:48,838
Media and that's where you do have to

681
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:49,950
pay attention to it but for a and I

682
00:28:48,838 --> 00:28:51,960
don't know how you feel about it so we

683
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:54,509
haven't talked about this but I've been

684
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:56,969
having great results after checking my

685
00:28:54,509 --> 00:28:59,190
water it's around six eight to seven - I

686
00:28:56,969 --> 00:29:01,019
know where it comes out and I haven't

687
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:03,570
really made any pH adjustments and I

688
00:29:01,019 --> 00:29:05,308
don't notice any nutrient deficiencies

689
00:29:03,569 --> 00:29:07,558
in the plant but I haven't gotten this

690
00:29:05,308 --> 00:29:09,450
leaf tissue test done on my own my

691
00:29:07,558 --> 00:29:11,700
outdoor plants so I'm just basing it off

692
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:13,710
of what I can see well you have pretty

693
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:16,889
perfect water I mean that to me

694
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:19,649
six-eight is is pretty pretty good yeah

695
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:23,548
yeah and what I was hearing is people

696
00:29:19,648 --> 00:29:25,258
have water as high as 8 or 81 and to me

697
00:29:23,548 --> 00:29:26,700
you know people are saying no don't

698
00:29:25,259 --> 00:29:28,889
worry about pH in your water you don't

699
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:31,669
need to do it no matter what the soil

700
00:29:28,888 --> 00:29:34,408
contains sufficient if it has good

701
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:36,778
microorganism levels and diversity it

702
00:29:34,409 --> 00:29:40,799
will buffer the pH for the plant in the

703
00:29:36,778 --> 00:29:44,460
rhizosphere which is correct

704
00:29:40,798 --> 00:29:47,128
like you said soil does have much higher

705
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:49,019
buffering capacity but I don't think it

706
00:29:47,128 --> 00:29:51,238
if we want to talk about optimal plant

707
00:29:49,019 --> 00:29:53,909
health and plant growth we want water to

708
00:29:51,239 --> 00:29:56,369
we want to be watering with things that

709
00:29:53,909 --> 00:29:57,659
are within optimal pH ranges - I don't

710
00:29:56,368 --> 00:29:59,878
think we get it throw the pH pen

711
00:29:57,659 --> 00:30:02,009
completely out the window we need to

712
00:29:59,878 --> 00:30:05,878
still know what we're starting with and

713
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:07,409
that's something that well we were

714
00:30:05,878 --> 00:30:08,699
getting into an argument with with these

715
00:30:07,409 --> 00:30:11,609
guys because they didn't we didn't agree

716
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:14,819
so since this is my podcast I get to

717
00:30:11,608 --> 00:30:16,528
share my opinion which is we do need to

718
00:30:14,819 --> 00:30:18,239
know what the pH of our water so you

719
00:30:16,528 --> 00:30:20,548
always need to start off knowing you

720
00:30:18,239 --> 00:30:23,098
know what's in your media what's in your

721
00:30:20,548 --> 00:30:24,808
water because you can't develop a

722
00:30:23,098 --> 00:30:26,838
fertilizer schedule or in a fertigation

723
00:30:24,808 --> 00:30:29,190
program until you know those two things

724
00:30:26,838 --> 00:30:30,418
because you just don't know what you're

725
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:31,739
starting with and I think that's so

726
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:33,450
important it's something that Travis

727
00:30:31,739 --> 00:30:35,519
Higginbotham mentioned in the last in

728
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:37,109
his podcast that I just released and

729
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:41,308
it's something that I think everyone

730
00:30:37,108 --> 00:30:42,658
needs to think about so I own I own a

731
00:30:41,308 --> 00:30:43,588
percent agree with you on that I mean

732
00:30:42,659 --> 00:30:46,169
you need to know what your starting

733
00:30:43,588 --> 00:30:49,408
inputs are otherwise if you have an

734
00:30:46,169 --> 00:30:51,570
issue or you have a problem with the

735
00:30:49,409 --> 00:30:53,609
plant health and you you didn't collect

736
00:30:51,569 --> 00:30:54,808
all the information for everything that

737
00:30:53,608 --> 00:30:55,949
you're putting into the plant

738
00:30:54,808 --> 00:30:58,588
you're not going to know how to address

739
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:59,130
the problem and again you know like you

740
00:30:58,588 --> 00:31:01,529
said there's

741
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:06,020
arranged for growth that that's pH

742
00:31:01,529 --> 00:31:08,759
that's humidity that's temperature right

743
00:31:06,019 --> 00:31:10,230
photo period you know I think that's a

744
00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:12,150
did I miss any I mean that's pretty much

745
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:14,610
right around work we need to pay

746
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:18,240
attention to this kind and you know

747
00:31:14,609 --> 00:31:19,949
fertility so or soil fertility so if you

748
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,950
don't know what you've got going on

749
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:24,450
there then you're flying blind so yeah a

750
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:26,190
hundred percent of grief but well if the

751
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:28,830
if the water coming out of the tap is in

752
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:31,470
the suitable range and you're doing you

753
00:31:28,829 --> 00:31:33,210
know some kind of you know infrequent or

754
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:34,589
frequent weekly testing or daily testing

755
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:36,840
to make sure it's if you're like on a

756
00:31:34,589 --> 00:31:38,369
well it shouldn't slide too much but I

757
00:31:36,839 --> 00:31:42,389
will say one thing if you're on a well

758
00:31:38,369 --> 00:31:44,579
and I've seen this a lot if you are on a

759
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:46,710
knew if let's say you let's use a

760
00:31:44,579 --> 00:31:48,869
hypothetical situation that I've seen if

761
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:50,850
you buy a property and you're gonna got

762
00:31:48,869 --> 00:31:52,649
your cannabis cultivation license and

763
00:31:50,849 --> 00:31:54,959
you're gonna start growing and you get a

764
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:56,730
water test on the well and it looks

765
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,170
great but you haven't really hit that

766
00:31:56,730 --> 00:32:00,150
well yet you haven't really started

767
00:31:58,170 --> 00:32:02,009
pumping water out of that well make sure

768
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:03,950
you're doing frequent tests on that well

769
00:32:02,009 --> 00:32:06,000
because what I see from a lot of well

770
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:07,860
from a lot of wells all around the

771
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,720
country is that after that well starts

772
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:11,459
to get you start pulling water out of

773
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:14,519
that well start using it

774
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:16,410
it'll you'll start seeing iron filling

775
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:18,599
up in the filters and I'm seeing across

776
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:20,580
the way and people just keep going ahead

777
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:22,379
they have got their D chlorinator

778
00:32:20,579 --> 00:32:25,799
sediment filter which is doing nothing

779
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:27,300
and they get these high super high

780
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:28,529
levels of ferrous iron and then they go

781
00:32:27,299 --> 00:32:30,480
back to their water test and they did

782
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:31,410
before they actually started using the

783
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,160
well and they're like well my water

784
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:34,800
looks fine

785
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:38,070
well you need to be doing frequent water

786
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:40,710
tests from your well water or municipal

787
00:32:38,069 --> 00:32:43,109
water to understand what's going on you

788
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:45,990
can't just do one water test and expect

789
00:32:43,109 --> 00:32:48,299
that you're gonna be golden and I see

790
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:50,309
that tad I see that all the time and

791
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:52,019
then they have plant problems and then I

792
00:32:50,309 --> 00:32:55,829
go check the filters and the filters are

793
00:32:52,019 --> 00:32:58,519
orange with like ferrous iron and clay

794
00:32:55,829 --> 00:33:01,799
covered all of them and I'm like guys

795
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:03,240
but what's going on here where's the

796
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:05,039
water test when was the last time you

797
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:06,779
had a water test and like oh we had a

798
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:08,159
water test a year ago here it is I'm

799
00:33:06,779 --> 00:33:09,539
like well that's not what your actual

800
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:11,880
water is anymore

801
00:33:09,539 --> 00:33:13,798
and there's a great guy I'm gonna give

802
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:18,990
him a plug and hopefully he doesn't kill

803
00:33:13,798 --> 00:33:23,548
me for this but Dan David Berlin over at

804
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:26,759
hyper logic is one of the best you know

805
00:33:23,548 --> 00:33:28,710
water purification water masters who I

806
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:31,319
will I send pictures of these filters

807
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:33,029
all all the time to Eman you know we've

808
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:36,509
kind of kind of like oh here we go again

809
00:33:33,029 --> 00:33:38,339
you know tell them to get a current

810
00:33:36,509 --> 00:33:40,519
water test so I just wanted to put that

811
00:33:38,339 --> 00:33:43,230
out there that's very important to be

812
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:44,808
constantly testing your water as you're

813
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:47,308
using that water source

814
00:33:44,808 --> 00:33:48,779
yeah farmers from an agricultural

815
00:33:47,308 --> 00:33:51,210
perspective will know that their water

816
00:33:48,779 --> 00:33:53,160
is going to change throughout the season

817
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:55,319
and so they they make adjustments

818
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:57,690
accordingly and you know for some of the

819
00:33:55,319 --> 00:33:59,668
reasons you mentioned and just some of

820
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:02,039
the seasonal changes with excessive

821
00:33:59,669 --> 00:34:03,540
rains you know bringing down things out

822
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:07,440
of the mountains and stuff like that and

823
00:34:03,539 --> 00:34:10,108
erosion so good point good point so

824
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,550
let's get into we haven't even talked

825
00:34:10,108 --> 00:34:13,139
about some of the stuff that I really

826
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:16,440
want to talk about which was this new

827
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:18,649
trial that you're setting up yeah let's

828
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:21,000
talk a little bit about that some of the

829
00:34:18,648 --> 00:34:21,719
some of your findings the reasons why

830
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,269
you did it

831
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:26,009
let's talk about some of the aspects of

832
00:34:24,269 --> 00:34:28,519
your trial in terms of controlling for a

833
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:33,750
variable that may not be perfect yeah

834
00:34:28,519 --> 00:34:35,820
yeah so I started working with LED

835
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:38,070
lighting what was it you know three or

836
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:42,359
four years ago now and I worked with a

837
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:43,679
lot of the initial kind of subpar LED

838
00:34:42,358 --> 00:34:45,960
fixtures that were out there and then

839
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:47,429
fluence came around and you know had

840
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:49,079
some good results with it but also had

841
00:34:47,429 --> 00:34:51,840
some challenges like everybody else did

842
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:53,639
in making the transition and now we're

843
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:56,280
kind you know none of you know fluence

844
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:57,630
really was the trendsetter and turning

845
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:00,900
the you know making the paradigm shift

846
00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:04,108
to some extent on you know really

847
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:06,990
looking at LED lighting as a excellent

848
00:35:04,108 --> 00:35:09,630
choice or solution for indoor controlled

849
00:35:06,989 --> 00:35:10,919
environment lighting now you've got a

850
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:13,858
lot of other companies that have jumped

851
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:15,389
on the bandwagon you have a whole market

852
00:35:13,858 --> 00:35:18,569
I mean you go to some of these trade

853
00:35:15,389 --> 00:35:20,909
shows and it's like a city of LED

854
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:22,650
lighting and I've you know I've been

855
00:35:20,909 --> 00:35:23,440
primarily working with the fluence

856
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:25,869
lighting

857
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,550
and seeing some started seeing some

858
00:35:25,869 --> 00:35:29,710
interesting results and different kinds

859
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:32,980
of results from other lighting companies

860
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:35,470
that were developing different ways of

861
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:39,519
delivering the photons whether that may

862
00:35:35,469 --> 00:35:42,189
be spectrum or footprint or you know

863
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:45,099
additional features so I reached out

864
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:49,150
about six months ago to other lighting

865
00:35:45,099 --> 00:35:51,190
companies that had I had seen some

866
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:52,838
interesting results from or I had heard

867
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:55,210
from other consultants or other growers

868
00:35:52,838 --> 00:35:57,578
that they were having that they were

869
00:35:55,210 --> 00:36:01,510
having you know good results from and

870
00:35:57,579 --> 00:36:05,050
are happy with the fixtures and I wanted

871
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:07,839
to you know kind of do a an imperfect

872
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:09,400
trial and see if any of these other

873
00:36:07,838 --> 00:36:11,710
lighting companies be willing to kind of

874
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:13,599
go up against what my standard has been

875
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:19,510
which has been in Spider x+ primarily

876
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:21,190
and also for me to see whether we know

877
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:23,380
where we're we're out on the market of

878
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:24,909
LED lighting and where they're certain

879
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:26,740
company is doing better things and other

880
00:36:24,909 --> 00:36:29,889
companies and hopefully putting this out

881
00:36:26,739 --> 00:36:31,929
publicly will improve everyone's product

882
00:36:29,889 --> 00:36:37,409
that they're putting out and provide

883
00:36:31,929 --> 00:36:40,210
data to the consumer and also perhaps

884
00:36:37,409 --> 00:36:42,670
look at I mean so the way that I have

885
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:45,639
the the trial set up it's a fairly small

886
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:49,750
little lab space and so I've got kind of

887
00:36:45,639 --> 00:36:51,519
a canopy of lighting above with LED

888
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:52,960
lighting get fairly close to the canopy

889
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:56,409
so even though there's going to be some

890
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:58,539
bleed over into the other light areas

891
00:36:56,409 --> 00:37:00,909
we'll still get a good idea because I'll

892
00:36:58,539 --> 00:37:02,829
be able to put fixtures fairly close six

893
00:37:00,909 --> 00:37:05,170
to twelve inches away from the light

894
00:37:02,829 --> 00:37:07,869
canopy some of that bleed over though

895
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:09,550
for me is interesting because the

896
00:37:07,869 --> 00:37:11,559
fixtures have different color

897
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:13,750
temperatures or different spectrums and

898
00:37:11,559 --> 00:37:15,880
there might be something interesting to

899
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:17,260
happen and that bleed over so I'll be

900
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:18,789
reading the color temperature of the

901
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:22,300
canopy in these certain areas and

902
00:37:18,789 --> 00:37:24,519
collecting data on you know the

903
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:27,609
differences around the canopy that's

904
00:37:24,519 --> 00:37:29,409
underneath these lights one of you know

905
00:37:27,608 --> 00:37:33,818
there's a so right now I've got the

906
00:37:29,409 --> 00:37:37,509
Spyder X plus Spectre and the BIOS

907
00:37:33,818 --> 00:37:39,460
lighting the gi2

908
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:41,260
and then to Vipers cuz I always have

909
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:43,480
people asking me what's better the viper

910
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:46,869
or the spider I tell them it has nothing

911
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:48,490
to do with the the using the spider or

912
00:37:46,869 --> 00:37:51,369
the Viper has more to do with your

913
00:37:48,489 --> 00:37:53,858
layout and your design than anything

914
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:57,490
else I like the Viper X plus a lot

915
00:37:53,858 --> 00:38:02,108
because it's it's a single bar that's

916
00:37:57,489 --> 00:38:05,679
fat and covers like mmm like a 4 by 3

917
00:38:02,108 --> 00:38:07,210
foot footprint fairly well and there's a

918
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:09,279
lot that you can do around that light

919
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:11,139
whereas a spider kind of takes up all of

920
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:13,900
the space above the light and I see a

921
00:38:11,139 --> 00:38:16,329
lot of these companies modeling their

922
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:18,760
fixtures off of that architecture

923
00:38:16,329 --> 00:38:20,619
lighting architecture and I don't know

924
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:23,470
if that's the best lighting architecture

925
00:38:20,619 --> 00:38:25,210
for indoor cultivation because a lot of

926
00:38:23,469 --> 00:38:27,069
times people are just designing these

927
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:28,559
lights thinking about the light canopy

928
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:31,210
but they're not thinking about

929
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:33,659
everything else that's involved in an

930
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:36,730
indoor growth space which is environment

931
00:38:33,659 --> 00:38:39,819
least surface temperature the way that

932
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:41,590
the air is moving how the lights can

933
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:42,789
work with the environmental equipment a

934
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:44,650
lot of people are just kind of thinking

935
00:38:42,789 --> 00:38:46,920
like we need to get this amount of PP FP

936
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:49,420
over this amount of square footage and

937
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:51,250
to some extent that can be great but

938
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:53,950
I've we're seeing a lot more of these

939
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:56,409
vertical moving systems or these

940
00:38:53,949 --> 00:38:57,909
vertical rack systems that move and they

941
00:38:56,409 --> 00:38:59,618
open up and you have one aisle

942
00:38:57,909 --> 00:39:01,960
so it's modeling out of a roll-top bench

943
00:38:59,619 --> 00:39:03,340
but just going up vertically so when you

944
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:05,050
start cramming all these lights and

945
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:06,550
plants together into this home position

946
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:08,530
where you've got rows and rows of these

947
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:10,960
plants and there's not a lot of air

948
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:13,690
movement people have been having a lot

949
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:16,179
of challenges with that so looking at

950
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:17,380
how now the lights being these lights

951
00:39:16,179 --> 00:39:18,909
like the spider X plus is being

952
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:22,119
repurposed for these vertical moving

953
00:39:18,909 --> 00:39:25,358
systems I'm also thinking about how the

954
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:30,250
architecture of the light can fit that

955
00:39:25,358 --> 00:39:31,929
model to allow for more space or for the

956
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:33,760
environment and environmental control

957
00:39:31,929 --> 00:39:35,919
which has been a serious challenge for a

958
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:38,619
lot of the people that are using these

959
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:41,010
LED vertical moving rack systems now the

960
00:39:38,619 --> 00:39:45,130
other thing that I've been looking at is

961
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:47,290
that I have noticed that certain

962
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:50,369
varietals under the fluence lighting

963
00:39:47,289 --> 00:39:52,230
will that spectrum

964
00:39:50,369 --> 00:39:54,989
or whatever reason they'll just get what

965
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:57,420
I call tired after a specific amount of

966
00:39:54,989 --> 00:40:01,349
light or duration of light even at the

967
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:04,710
lower ppfd so let's say between 200 and

968
00:40:01,349 --> 00:40:07,199
300 ppfd in veg after 16 hours of light

969
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:09,300
the plants you know a lot and I've seen

970
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:11,099
this in multiple grows and I you know it

971
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:12,450
could be something else but it's can you

972
00:40:11,099 --> 00:40:14,610
know I haven't collected enough data on

973
00:40:12,449 --> 00:40:16,859
everything but I have seen consistency

974
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:18,660
with that with other individuals online

975
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:20,760
where the plans just certain plants

976
00:40:18,659 --> 00:40:22,710
certain variety and they start to droop

977
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:24,390
like they've had enough and it's time to

978
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:26,519
turn off and it's time to go to sleep I

979
00:40:24,389 --> 00:40:29,940
never saw that really under

980
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:32,849
high-pressure sodium lighting or ceramic

981
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:34,110
metal high light lighting I have seen

982
00:40:32,849 --> 00:40:35,670
that from the get-go with the fluence

983
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:36,809
lighting I'm had to make adjustments and

984
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:39,720
then certain things became more

985
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:43,489
important like vapor pressure deficit

986
00:40:39,719 --> 00:40:46,079
and V PDV pressure differential and then

987
00:40:43,489 --> 00:40:49,349
adjusting the intensity of the lighting

988
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:51,840
and really having to work very hard on

989
00:40:49,349 --> 00:40:54,420
keeping the plants healthy so the

990
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:58,260
photosynthesis continues transpiration

991
00:40:54,420 --> 00:41:00,900
continues now I I think that that has

992
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:03,090
something to do with the spectrum of the

993
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:04,289
light and the color temperature and I

994
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:06,000
think there might be a little bit too

995
00:41:04,289 --> 00:41:06,900
much of something and not enough

996
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,510
something else

997
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:10,769
so part of what I've what I've done is

998
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:14,490
I've looked at other lighting companies

999
00:41:10,769 --> 00:41:16,079
that have different spectrums and tried

1000
00:41:14,489 --> 00:41:17,869
to compare to see if it's something with

1001
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:20,130
with the lighting now I will say that

1002
00:41:17,869 --> 00:41:22,380
you know right now I'm using the bios

1003
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:26,010
the bios light in the trial so it's it's

1004
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:29,730
really the spectre light is pretty close

1005
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:32,670
to the fluence light as far as spectrum

1006
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:35,309
and design it's a little egregious to

1007
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:36,930
some extent how close it is the BIOS

1008
00:41:35,309 --> 00:41:40,949
lighting is kind of its own beast it's

1009
00:41:36,929 --> 00:41:43,169
been it was developed by you know a NASA

1010
00:41:40,949 --> 00:41:45,329
scientist which is kind of cool because

1011
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:46,050
I'm all about space travel and s and all

1012
00:41:45,329 --> 00:41:50,730
these kinds of things

1013
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:52,289
sidenote and i have been vegging i have

1014
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:54,480
plants vegging under the bios lighting

1015
00:41:52,289 --> 00:41:56,489
and plants the same gelato strain

1016
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:58,740
vegging under the fluence lighting and I

1017
00:41:56,489 --> 00:42:01,079
have noticed off the bat right now that

1018
00:41:58,739 --> 00:42:02,279
the color temple ants are enjoying the

1019
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:03,750
color temperature a little bit better in

1020
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:05,330
the vegetative state

1021
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:07,829
the BIOS lighting at the same ppfd

1022
00:42:05,329 --> 00:42:10,349
without getting that tiredness now I

1023
00:42:07,829 --> 00:42:15,000
don't know if that makes the BIOS

1024
00:42:10,349 --> 00:42:17,219
lighting spectrum better for vegetative

1025
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,199
oh and whether that's gonna carry over

1026
00:42:17,219 --> 00:42:21,959
and I'm gonna see a benefit in Flour

1027
00:42:19,199 --> 00:42:24,569
because I've had fantastic results with

1028
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:27,869
the Spyder X plus and flower but it does

1029
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:30,510
it does make it a little bit easier for

1030
00:42:27,869 --> 00:42:31,679
me when I'm when I'm not having to deal

1031
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:33,720
with the plants getting stressed out

1032
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:36,750
from having too much maybe it's too much

1033
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:40,019
red I don't know so you know those are

1034
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:41,969
my early findings right now and you know

1035
00:42:40,019 --> 00:42:44,940
I'm gonna be making some more videos on

1036
00:42:41,969 --> 00:42:47,549
that and posting that up on Instagram

1037
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:51,450
and on YouTube and I will say one thing

1038
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:56,820
that BIOS light is really heavy it is I

1039
00:42:51,449 --> 00:42:59,250
think it's like 40 or 50 pounds and that

1040
00:42:56,820 --> 00:43:01,590
is not that is not a one-man job hanging

1041
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:05,670
that light whereas the spider I can hang

1042
00:43:01,590 --> 00:43:07,559
that light one-man job on that the BIOS

1043
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:09,420
light you're definitely need the GI to

1044
00:43:07,559 --> 00:43:11,400
at least you're gonna need two people to

1045
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:13,980
hang that light just a warning

1046
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:16,740
I was surprised on our IV it is and the

1047
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:19,320
so I like the spectrum on the BIOS light

1048
00:43:16,739 --> 00:43:24,329
but it's heavy and it doesn't have the

1049
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:25,800
same radiant cooling design that the

1050
00:43:24,329 --> 00:43:28,980
fluence light has so the top of the

1051
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:32,070
fixture gets very hot like 140 150

1052
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:33,539
degrees so just keep all that in mind so

1053
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:36,320
there's positives and negatives to both

1054
00:43:33,539 --> 00:43:38,849
fixtures so far from what I found

1055
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:41,430
okay so a couple of thoughts here you

1056
00:43:38,849 --> 00:43:46,369
talked about that one could you say that

1057
00:43:41,429 --> 00:43:48,509
maybe the fluence light has a

1058
00:43:46,369 --> 00:43:53,039
potentially better spectrum in the sense

1059
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:55,110
that you could shorten your your photo

1060
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:58,230
period because the the plants reaching

1061
00:43:55,110 --> 00:43:59,789
it's it's DLI or the amount of light

1062
00:43:58,230 --> 00:44:02,610
that the plant can take up in a given

1063
00:43:59,789 --> 00:44:04,980
photo period sooner so maybe you could

1064
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:07,559
take an hour off of your vegetative

1065
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:12,300
period and still get the same growth

1066
00:44:07,559 --> 00:44:15,029
rates I yeah I like to veg under fluence

1067
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:16,330
lighting for 16 hours of light in 18

1068
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:20,650
hours

1069
00:44:16,329 --> 00:44:23,110
of darkness so yeah that is a benefit I

1070
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:25,720
don't know if it I don't know if it's

1071
00:44:23,110 --> 00:44:27,490
comparable if it that creates more

1072
00:44:25,719 --> 00:44:29,709
growth or not but you're not running the

1073
00:44:27,489 --> 00:44:31,919
lights for two additional hours I have

1074
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:34,150
I've told that to a lot of people and

1075
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:35,889
that a vast that have asked me about

1076
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:38,289
I've seen this tiredness thing as well

1077
00:44:35,889 --> 00:44:41,079
and I said well switch to 18 you know 16

1078
00:44:38,289 --> 00:44:42,670
hours of light and 88 hours of darkness

1079
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:43,840
and a lot of people are hesitant to do

1080
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:46,570
that because it's been kind of the

1081
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:48,460
standard to veg for either 18 6 or 24

1082
00:44:46,570 --> 00:44:50,500
hours but I'd say if you're using the

1083
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:51,730
fluence light tribe edging for 16 hours

1084
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:53,619
that was actually their initial

1085
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:56,469
recommendation when they first put out

1086
00:44:53,619 --> 00:44:57,670
the light and it a lot of people weren't

1087
00:44:56,469 --> 00:44:59,459
willing to do that because they were

1088
00:44:57,670 --> 00:45:02,019
afraid that the plants were gonna flower

1089
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:04,480
yeah you're getting closer to that full

1090
00:45:02,019 --> 00:45:05,800
photo periodic response I'm really

1091
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:08,050
excited to hear what Travis Higginbotham

1092
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:10,480
comes up with over the next year as he

1093
00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:12,820
gets sort of more entrenched and

1094
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:16,599
experienced in his position he was our

1095
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:18,070
last podcast interview and I really like

1096
00:45:16,599 --> 00:45:19,960
what his knowledge and what he had to

1097
00:45:18,070 --> 00:45:21,160
say so off to follow up with him again

1098
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:22,720
on that one

1099
00:45:21,159 --> 00:45:24,549
so that was one thought that my other

1100
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:27,309
thought is if a light is getting really

1101
00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:30,550
hot doesn't that mean that in a sense

1102
00:45:27,309 --> 00:45:33,400
it's less efficient at converting energy

1103
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:34,870
into photons and I'm not I'm not

1104
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:36,190
criticizing this light it's just

1105
00:45:34,869 --> 00:45:38,079
something just I'm just talking out loud

1106
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:43,889
about I don't know a lot about lighting

1107
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:46,029
so yeah yeah so wattage no so no matter

1108
00:45:43,889 --> 00:45:48,879
wat ajiz going to create a specific

1109
00:45:46,030 --> 00:45:52,540
amount of BTUs alright so if you have

1110
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:54,610
600 watts you're gonna have 600 watts of

1111
00:45:52,539 --> 00:45:57,190
heat alright in that heat

1112
00:45:54,610 --> 00:46:02,170
I think it's the you know for every watt

1113
00:45:57,190 --> 00:46:04,570
you multiply that times 3.41 BTU or 3.14

1114
00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:06,190
BTU forgive me if I get the before and

1115
00:46:04,570 --> 00:46:08,230
the one mixed up and then that's what

1116
00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:10,720
that's how you figure out how much heat

1117
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:13,990
which is which the engineers call

1118
00:46:10,719 --> 00:46:15,339
sensible load is going into the room for

1119
00:46:13,989 --> 00:46:16,989
the fixture so it doesn't you know that

1120
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:18,880
has to do with any electronic device

1121
00:46:16,989 --> 00:46:21,879
right any electronic device any any

1122
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:23,470
device that's powered is you know that

1123
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:25,150
amount of wattage is going to it it's

1124
00:46:23,469 --> 00:46:27,309
going to create that amount of heat and

1125
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:28,570
now when we this is something like

1126
00:46:27,309 --> 00:46:30,159
people get confused about so just

1127
00:46:28,570 --> 00:46:33,278
because you're running

1128
00:46:30,159 --> 00:46:35,739
an LED doesn't mean that you know so

1129
00:46:33,278 --> 00:46:38,349
let's say you have 600 watts of LED

1130
00:46:35,739 --> 00:46:40,479
lighting and then you have 600 watts of

1131
00:46:38,349 --> 00:46:42,579
high-pressure sodium lighting they're

1132
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:45,099
gonna produce the same amount of heat

1133
00:46:42,579 --> 00:46:47,230
all right the difference is that from

1134
00:46:45,099 --> 00:46:49,599
the 600 watt high-pressure sodium light

1135
00:46:47,230 --> 00:46:54,278
you're only getting let's say 400 or 500

1136
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:55,630
ppfd so 400 or 500 you know the amount

1137
00:46:54,278 --> 00:46:57,759
of photons that are being produced

1138
00:46:55,630 --> 00:47:00,400
that's usable for the plant it's like

1139
00:46:57,759 --> 00:47:01,539
400 or 500 whereas with the LED that's

1140
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:04,630
the same amount of wattage you're

1141
00:47:01,539 --> 00:47:06,278
getting a thousand or 1100 so it's

1142
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:08,789
producing the same amount of heat but

1143
00:47:06,278 --> 00:47:11,048
more usable light does that make sense

1144
00:47:08,789 --> 00:47:13,059
yeah so in theory you could use less

1145
00:47:11,048 --> 00:47:16,119
lights which would in which would also

1146
00:47:13,059 --> 00:47:19,150
lower the amount of heat being created

1147
00:47:16,119 --> 00:47:21,490
in a given room and get and get the same

1148
00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:22,210
amount of ppfd for as of the 600 watt of

1149
00:47:21,489 --> 00:47:25,149
high-pressure sodium

1150
00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:26,889
correct now why is there so much heat

1151
00:47:25,150 --> 00:47:28,778
coming off of the BIOS light that has to

1152
00:47:26,889 --> 00:47:30,219
do with the architecture and has to do

1153
00:47:28,778 --> 00:47:33,789
with the way that they heat that the

1154
00:47:30,219 --> 00:47:36,009
light is the light is designed to handle

1155
00:47:33,789 --> 00:47:38,740
the diffusion of that heat all right now

1156
00:47:36,009 --> 00:47:41,588
BIOS it seems like BIOS has opted to go

1157
00:47:38,739 --> 00:47:44,739
with more of a waterproof kind of very

1158
00:47:41,588 --> 00:47:46,719
heavy duty design which I can understand

1159
00:47:44,739 --> 00:47:48,879
why they would do that whereas you know

1160
00:47:46,719 --> 00:47:51,219
they have you know four big chunky bars

1161
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:52,539
you know and it's in a series and then

1162
00:47:51,219 --> 00:47:55,868
you look at the fluence light and

1163
00:47:52,539 --> 00:47:59,819
they've got eight bars and the fluence

1164
00:47:55,869 --> 00:48:02,289
light has these fins that you would see

1165
00:47:59,818 --> 00:48:05,528
there you know the radiant cooling fin

1166
00:48:02,289 --> 00:48:07,269
so it spreads the surface area to allow

1167
00:48:05,528 --> 00:48:08,559
for better heat diffusion of the

1168
00:48:07,268 --> 00:48:09,909
fixtures so there's more surface area

1169
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:13,839
there it's the same thing you'd see

1170
00:48:09,909 --> 00:48:15,848
unlike I'm on one of your ballast or any

1171
00:48:13,838 --> 00:48:17,259
kind of power source or there's a lot of

1172
00:48:15,849 --> 00:48:18,579
wattage going into something or a lot of

1173
00:48:17,259 --> 00:48:20,679
energy going in something they they

1174
00:48:18,579 --> 00:48:22,869
create those fins you see it in computer

1175
00:48:20,679 --> 00:48:25,929
equipment as well and that allows for

1176
00:48:22,869 --> 00:48:28,720
greater air movement over the surface of

1177
00:48:25,929 --> 00:48:31,028
the equipment to allow for better air to

1178
00:48:28,719 --> 00:48:34,149
you know heat dispersion in diffusion so

1179
00:48:31,028 --> 00:48:35,230
when you're when you're measuring you

1180
00:48:34,150 --> 00:48:36,548
you know you get your little laser

1181
00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:40,119
thermometer and measure the fluence

1182
00:48:36,548 --> 00:48:42,038
light it does a very good job dispersing

1183
00:48:40,119 --> 00:48:44,019
that heat into the environment so as

1184
00:48:42,039 --> 00:48:46,300
long you know what I think about is

1185
00:48:44,019 --> 00:48:48,309
being able to control the room

1186
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:50,019
environment and if I have just ambient

1187
00:48:48,309 --> 00:48:52,570
heating it's being dispersed I mean that

1188
00:48:50,019 --> 00:48:54,280
eat is now being spread around the

1189
00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:55,869
volume of the room so it's easier to

1190
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:59,380
manage it's easier for the equipment to

1191
00:48:55,869 --> 00:49:00,910
you know cool that room whereas if you

1192
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:02,800
have hot spots which is what we're

1193
00:49:00,909 --> 00:49:05,199
trying to stay away from in cultivation

1194
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:07,630
where we have these pockets of heat

1195
00:49:05,199 --> 00:49:09,250
pockets of humidity pockets of coldness

1196
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:11,800
we don't want that we want it to be

1197
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:13,960
consistent so that's the only thing that

1198
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:16,030
you know like oh you know that and

1199
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:19,530
that's that's one of the positives of

1200
00:49:16,030 --> 00:49:23,050
having an LED fixture is you get that

1201
00:49:19,530 --> 00:49:24,400
you can you can you're looking when you

1202
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:26,230
look at your ambient temperature you're

1203
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:27,910
really kind of seeing you know what's

1204
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:28,780
close to what your canopy temperature is

1205
00:49:27,909 --> 00:49:31,569
and then when you have a high pressure

1206
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:33,550
sodium like it's going to be very very

1207
00:49:31,570 --> 00:49:34,900
hot under the bulb because that's where

1208
00:49:33,550 --> 00:49:36,940
a lot of that heat is coming from

1209
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:39,338
and we'll say the BIOS light the heat is

1210
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:43,809
being thrown up to the top of the

1211
00:49:39,338 --> 00:49:46,900
fixture and when you're below the LED

1212
00:49:43,809 --> 00:49:49,269
diodes it's not anywhere near as hot but

1213
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:51,160
you still have that hot spot above the

1214
00:49:49,269 --> 00:49:53,108
light so if you've got really tall

1215
00:49:51,159 --> 00:49:55,420
ceilings not a big deal but in this lab

1216
00:49:53,108 --> 00:49:57,670
I don't have tall ceilings and I'd say

1217
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:59,409
that you know the fixture was heating up

1218
00:49:57,670 --> 00:50:00,750
the ceiling which was about a foot and a

1219
00:49:59,409 --> 00:50:04,059
half away

1220
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:06,159
you know I'll you know was 20 degrees

1221
00:50:04,059 --> 00:50:07,329
higher than I was getting under the

1222
00:50:06,159 --> 00:50:09,489
fluence light so fluence has done a

1223
00:50:07,329 --> 00:50:13,529
really good job in figuring out how to

1224
00:50:09,489 --> 00:50:15,879
disperse that heat and you know that's

1225
00:50:13,530 --> 00:50:17,830
it's kind of my little analysis and all

1226
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:19,510
that well I'm excited to hear your

1227
00:50:17,829 --> 00:50:21,519
results that's really cool what you're

1228
00:50:19,510 --> 00:50:25,599
doing thanks man me too

1229
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:29,199
I'm super grateful for all the lighting

1230
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:32,619
companies that have been open to doing

1231
00:50:29,199 --> 00:50:34,480
this because I know that you know

1232
00:50:32,619 --> 00:50:35,920
everyone everyone wants you they don't

1233
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:37,059
want anything I'm not I'm not trying to

1234
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:38,230
do any damage to any of these companies

1235
00:50:37,059 --> 00:50:40,960
at all it's really just trying to be a

1236
00:50:38,230 --> 00:50:42,519
give a fair test so we can look at

1237
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:44,650
what's positive and then all those

1238
00:50:42,519 --> 00:50:46,179
companies can kind of come back and use

1239
00:50:44,650 --> 00:50:47,289
that data to improve what they're doing

1240
00:50:46,179 --> 00:50:49,929
because they're all doing something

1241
00:50:47,289 --> 00:50:53,409
that's fantastic and unique and exciting

1242
00:50:49,929 --> 00:50:55,569
and it's it's all this is just going to

1243
00:50:53,409 --> 00:50:56,289
lead to more efficient cultivation

1244
00:50:55,570 --> 00:51:01,210
methodology

1245
00:50:56,289 --> 00:51:02,650
and I'm all for that so the last thing I

1246
00:51:01,210 --> 00:51:06,280
wanted to talk to you about was sort of

1247
00:51:02,650 --> 00:51:09,670
your experiences with the different you

1248
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:11,200
know facilities and grow operations that

1249
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:13,360
you've been doing consulting on what are

1250
00:51:11,199 --> 00:51:20,019
you seeing out there in California right

1251
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:20,769
now I am seeing a lot of fat if that

1252
00:51:20,019 --> 00:51:24,969
makes sense

1253
00:51:20,769 --> 00:51:28,570
so seeing a lot of waste I'm seeing a

1254
00:51:24,969 --> 00:51:31,509
lot of a lot of cultivators and farms

1255
00:51:28,570 --> 00:51:38,789
struggling to make the transition over

1256
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:41,170
into a commercial business framework and

1257
00:51:38,789 --> 00:51:43,630
not having a lot of time to do that

1258
00:51:41,170 --> 00:51:46,389
because things are moving lightning fast

1259
00:51:43,630 --> 00:51:51,369
and it's chaotic and it's very very

1260
00:51:46,389 --> 00:51:55,539
difficult and what worked for the last

1261
00:51:51,369 --> 00:51:57,369
10 to 15 years doesn't really work

1262
00:51:55,539 --> 00:52:01,480
anymore because the margins have gone

1263
00:51:57,369 --> 00:52:03,909
down and I remember a few years ago

1264
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:05,380
listening to Bob Hoffman who's one of

1265
00:52:03,909 --> 00:52:08,469
the largest basil growers in the United

1266
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:10,090
States talked to a bunch of cannabis

1267
00:52:08,469 --> 00:52:12,639
growers and he said hey guys guess what

1268
00:52:10,090 --> 00:52:15,130
your margins they're great now they're

1269
00:52:12,639 --> 00:52:17,139
not gonna last forever enjoy it while

1270
00:52:15,130 --> 00:52:19,780
you can because it's gonna go away

1271
00:52:17,139 --> 00:52:21,670
sooner than you think and that's what

1272
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:25,380
I'm seeing happen right now but people

1273
00:52:21,670 --> 00:52:28,690
are still cultivating and growing

1274
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:34,110
cannabis there the cost to produce a

1275
00:52:28,690 --> 00:52:37,599
pound is still above $500 on average and

1276
00:52:34,110 --> 00:52:39,670
we have an oversupply in California much

1277
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:40,690
like what's going on in Washington

1278
00:52:39,670 --> 00:52:43,690
Oregon

1279
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:47,980
even though Washington and Oregon have a

1280
00:52:43,690 --> 00:52:51,250
much further developed recreational

1281
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:52,690
market than California does but people

1282
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:55,780
forgot that California has been

1283
00:52:52,690 --> 00:52:58,599
producing a lot of weed for a really

1284
00:52:55,780 --> 00:53:03,580
long time and now all those people are

1285
00:52:58,599 --> 00:53:06,969
having to pay taxes and you know there's

1286
00:53:03,579 --> 00:53:09,318
a lot of taxes probably too many taxes

1287
00:53:06,969 --> 00:53:11,689
and they

1288
00:53:09,318 --> 00:53:13,670
haven't really figured out how to reduce

1289
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:16,039
their cost of production I would say

1290
00:53:13,670 --> 00:53:18,349
that some people have started to you and

1291
00:53:16,039 --> 00:53:22,660
it's beginning to happen but they have

1292
00:53:18,349 --> 00:53:26,088
to do it faster and they have to take I

1293
00:53:22,659 --> 00:53:28,458
you know take a cue from large-scale

1294
00:53:26,088 --> 00:53:30,139
agriculture to some extent if they're

1295
00:53:28,458 --> 00:53:32,629
trying to do these massive farms and

1296
00:53:30,139 --> 00:53:35,868
really try and reduce costs so I see a

1297
00:53:32,630 --> 00:53:39,829
lot of waste I see a lot of money being

1298
00:53:35,869 --> 00:53:45,019
spent on things that aren't maybe needed

1299
00:53:39,829 --> 00:53:47,798
and improper planning to understand what

1300
00:53:45,018 --> 00:53:50,808
you guys are gonna need on the OP X

1301
00:53:47,798 --> 00:53:52,759
moving into these grows they're kind of

1302
00:53:50,809 --> 00:53:53,869
going about it the way that they've been

1303
00:53:52,759 --> 00:53:55,429
going about it for the last ten years

1304
00:53:53,869 --> 00:53:58,430
and a lot of people are failing a lot of

1305
00:53:55,429 --> 00:53:59,838
people are hurting because of it so what

1306
00:53:58,429 --> 00:54:03,498
what do you see is a viable solution

1307
00:53:59,838 --> 00:54:05,119
like if you were starting a grow or

1308
00:54:03,498 --> 00:54:07,509
helping someone that was starting a

1309
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:09,739
grill how do you go about analyzing

1310
00:54:07,509 --> 00:54:15,079
efficiency and and finding ways to

1311
00:54:09,739 --> 00:54:18,829
improve that well what I recommend

1312
00:54:15,079 --> 00:54:21,829
everybody begin with is a quote unquote

1313
00:54:18,829 --> 00:54:24,318
plant program so what I'll see happen a

1314
00:54:21,829 --> 00:54:26,059
lot of times is people will start out

1315
00:54:24,318 --> 00:54:28,969
with a rough idea of what they want to

1316
00:54:26,059 --> 00:54:32,569
do in their space and then they will lay

1317
00:54:28,969 --> 00:54:35,179
on top of that space a thought that they

1318
00:54:32,568 --> 00:54:37,608
can do more than is actually possible so

1319
00:54:35,179 --> 00:54:39,379
every space that you're working in you

1320
00:54:37,608 --> 00:54:41,588
know whether it's outdoors whether it's

1321
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:43,640
a greenhouse or whether it's an indoor

1322
00:54:41,588 --> 00:54:45,728
cultivation space it's gonna have a

1323
00:54:43,639 --> 00:54:48,440
limitation on how much can be produced

1324
00:54:45,728 --> 00:54:52,759
cramming more into that space is

1325
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:54,528
actually going to reduce the output than

1326
00:54:52,759 --> 00:54:58,088
if you met then it than if you were to

1327
00:54:54,528 --> 00:55:01,818
meet the space with where it's maybe

1328
00:54:58,088 --> 00:55:03,679
operationally tuned so one of the first

1329
00:55:01,818 --> 00:55:06,798
things I like to do is sit down and look

1330
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:09,078
at the space and create a layout and a

1331
00:55:06,798 --> 00:55:12,829
floor plan for where every plant is

1332
00:55:09,079 --> 00:55:15,890
going to go and then base expectations

1333
00:55:12,829 --> 00:55:18,979
on what's going to be produced on what

1334
00:55:15,889 --> 00:55:21,048
the space can actually handle so once

1335
00:55:18,978 --> 00:55:22,969
we've established that floor plan now

1336
00:55:21,048 --> 00:55:25,280
this is assuming that you have

1337
00:55:22,969 --> 00:55:29,419
your areas or rooms already kind of

1338
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:32,540
mapped out then after that then we look

1339
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:34,849
at what the current equipment is in the

1340
00:55:32,539 --> 00:55:36,380
facility or the Specht we talk about

1341
00:55:34,849 --> 00:55:37,759
what we're gonna spec for the equipment

1342
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:39,170
but a lot of times I'm coming in and

1343
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:41,180
doing audits on facilities that were

1344
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:43,220
already built and they were poorly

1345
00:55:41,179 --> 00:55:46,279
planned from the get-go

1346
00:55:43,219 --> 00:55:48,259
for whatever reason so what we we have a

1347
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:50,360
lot of times reduce people's

1348
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:52,730
expectations and what they can pull out

1349
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:54,470
of the space by looking at what the

1350
00:55:52,730 --> 00:55:57,920
space can actually handle so we'll go

1351
00:55:54,469 --> 00:56:02,239
from plant count to what our equipment

1352
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:04,610
sizing is and then we'll figure out you

1353
00:56:02,239 --> 00:56:08,479
know the optimum amount of plants that

1354
00:56:04,610 --> 00:56:09,860
can be in each room based on keeping in

1355
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:11,780
a controlled environment based on what

1356
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:15,380
the equipment can handle and then we'll

1357
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:17,690
come up with a flow for where the plants

1358
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:19,309
begin you know in the facility whether

1359
00:56:17,690 --> 00:56:21,409
they're starting as a clone or a seed

1360
00:56:19,309 --> 00:56:24,820
and where they're going to end and we

1361
00:56:21,409 --> 00:56:30,259
map out every part of that process and

1362
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:34,460
then essentially run a digital form of

1363
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:39,260
the operation to give that client or

1364
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:44,780
give the farmer an idea of the path of

1365
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:46,520
his grow room and every every expandable

1366
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:50,390
every supply that's needed to get that

1367
00:56:46,519 --> 00:56:51,920
plan from point A to point Z a lot of

1368
00:56:50,389 --> 00:56:55,960
times people are just kind of winging it

1369
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:58,700
and what happens when you wing it is you

1370
00:56:55,960 --> 00:57:02,510
waste a lot of time a lot of money and a

1371
00:56:58,699 --> 00:57:04,399
lot of labor so the first thing to do is

1372
00:57:02,510 --> 00:57:07,910
come up with a plan an operational plan

1373
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:09,889
in a plant program and have you know

1374
00:57:07,909 --> 00:57:11,239
manage your expectations of what you're

1375
00:57:09,889 --> 00:57:13,489
gonna actually produce out of the space

1376
00:57:11,239 --> 00:57:16,189
you know whether your nursery or whether

1377
00:57:13,489 --> 00:57:18,319
you're producing for flour there's gonna

1378
00:57:16,190 --> 00:57:21,230
be a limit you can't you know if you

1379
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:23,539
have enough space for 10,000 clones or

1380
00:57:21,230 --> 00:57:25,099
5,000 clones to be produced per month

1381
00:57:23,539 --> 00:57:27,320
that's all you're gonna get you're not

1382
00:57:25,099 --> 00:57:29,420
going to get any more than that unless

1383
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:32,269
you expand your space in an intelligent

1384
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:33,460
way so that's a lot of a lot of what

1385
00:57:32,269 --> 00:57:36,190
I've been doing now is looking at that

1386
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:38,530
analyzing why there are fail points

1387
00:57:36,190 --> 00:57:41,079
and offering people solutions and a lot

1388
00:57:38,530 --> 00:57:43,300
of that has to do with reducing what

1389
00:57:41,079 --> 00:57:44,859
they're trying to do within the

1390
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:48,609
limitations about getting real within

1391
00:57:44,858 --> 00:57:50,529
with the limitations of your farm so

1392
00:57:48,608 --> 00:57:53,108
what you're describing is very similar

1393
00:57:50,530 --> 00:57:54,670
to what Ben Hartman was talking about

1394
00:57:53,108 --> 00:57:59,139
around lean farming or lean

1395
00:57:54,670 --> 00:58:01,059
manufacturing in terms of setting up and

1396
00:57:59,139 --> 00:58:05,588
really understanding workflows

1397
00:58:01,059 --> 00:58:09,639
is that correct yes yeah his book is

1398
00:58:05,588 --> 00:58:11,170
awesome and I bugged you for a while

1399
00:58:09,639 --> 00:58:14,108
there I was like you need to read this

1400
00:58:11,170 --> 00:58:17,800
book yeah so know that I was doing I was

1401
00:58:14,108 --> 00:58:21,909
I would say that I've worked with some

1402
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:24,329
engineering companies on the

1403
00:58:21,909 --> 00:58:27,789
pre-production that's involved in

1404
00:58:24,329 --> 00:58:31,050
planning out these gardens but after

1405
00:58:27,789 --> 00:58:34,179
reading that book it really helped me

1406
00:58:31,050 --> 00:58:35,859
turn it into something tangible after

1407
00:58:34,179 --> 00:58:37,690
the plan was finished and also

1408
00:58:35,858 --> 00:58:41,108
understanding how to really think about

1409
00:58:37,690 --> 00:58:42,250
how you plan your garden you know a lot

1410
00:58:41,108 --> 00:58:43,900
of people are just starting with like an

1411
00:58:42,250 --> 00:58:45,730
empty rectangle and they're trying to

1412
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:48,639
fill it in with as many plants and as

1413
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:50,858
much canopy as possible also you know

1414
00:58:48,639 --> 00:58:52,179
just because you have a twenty thousand

1415
00:58:50,858 --> 00:58:53,380
square foot building doesn't mean you're

1416
00:58:52,179 --> 00:58:55,358
gonna get a ten thousand square-foot

1417
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:58,358
canopy out of that there's a lot of

1418
00:58:55,358 --> 00:59:00,098
space needed for the actual operations

1419
00:58:58,358 --> 00:59:04,318
plant movement all these kinds of things

1420
00:59:00,099 --> 00:59:06,309
so a lot of for the first three years of

1421
00:59:04,318 --> 00:59:07,960
you know doing some of this facility

1422
00:59:06,309 --> 00:59:08,980
design I'd work with the owner of the

1423
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:10,119
building and they'd be like we got a

1424
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:12,309
twenty thousand square foot building

1425
00:59:10,119 --> 00:59:13,990
let's put a 20,000 square foot canopy in

1426
00:59:12,309 --> 00:59:15,940
the building and it's like where are you

1427
00:59:13,989 --> 00:59:17,729
gonna take a [ __ ] you know it's like

1428
00:59:15,940 --> 00:59:20,980
people aren't even thinking about that

1429
00:59:17,730 --> 00:59:22,539
so yeah that book was a huge influence

1430
00:59:20,980 --> 00:59:26,079
on how all these things kind of work

1431
00:59:22,539 --> 00:59:29,199
together and the lean farm man that's it

1432
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:30,400
so you know amen thank you for turning

1433
00:59:29,199 --> 00:59:32,439
me on to that book and thank you for

1434
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:35,380
that podcast great podcast well I think

1435
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:37,650
people just needed time to spend time

1436
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:40,030
planning time spent planning is not time

1437
00:59:37,650 --> 00:59:43,030
wasted in fact it's probably the most

1438
00:59:40,030 --> 00:59:46,390
efficient thing you can do and I'm a

1439
00:59:43,030 --> 00:59:49,930
culprit of this even now I don't have as

1440
00:59:46,389 --> 00:59:51,818
much sop or standard operating procedure

1441
00:59:49,929 --> 00:59:53,529
established as I should because

1442
00:59:51,818 --> 00:59:54,940
realistically when you're running a

1443
00:59:53,530 --> 00:59:57,430
business or running an operation like

1444
00:59:54,940 --> 00:59:59,619
this you need everything to be

1445
00:59:57,429 --> 01:00:01,779
standardized as much as possible so the

1446
00:59:59,619 --> 01:00:03,700
employees know have expect know what

1447
01:00:01,780 --> 01:00:05,980
their expectations are and at the same

1448
01:00:03,699 --> 01:00:08,679
time have a resource that they can go to

1449
01:00:05,980 --> 01:00:10,809
to understand what they should be doing

1450
01:00:08,679 --> 01:00:11,769
and why they're doing it too and that's

1451
01:00:10,809 --> 01:00:14,410
something that you should have already

1452
01:00:11,769 --> 01:00:16,119
thought about hopefully in a perfect

1453
01:00:14,409 --> 01:00:17,858
world before starting your business but

1454
01:00:16,119 --> 01:00:19,930
that's not what happened in my case not

1455
01:00:17,858 --> 01:00:24,130
even close but we're working towards

1456
01:00:19,929 --> 01:00:25,509
that you know yeah a lot of I think

1457
01:00:24,130 --> 01:00:27,550
that's the kid I think that's the case

1458
01:00:25,510 --> 01:00:29,410
with most people also the other thing is

1459
01:00:27,550 --> 01:00:31,450
a lot of times people write an SOP and

1460
01:00:29,409 --> 01:00:33,429
they spend a lot of time and money doing

1461
01:00:31,449 --> 01:00:34,659
that and then they get their garden belt

1462
01:00:33,429 --> 01:00:37,299
and then no one follows it

1463
01:00:34,659 --> 01:00:39,848
so the spxl has to make sense and it has

1464
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:42,430
to be applied to what's actually going

1465
01:00:39,849 --> 01:00:45,130
on I see that all the time I'll see like

1466
01:00:42,429 --> 01:00:46,838
a manual that manual just gets dust that

1467
01:00:45,130 --> 01:00:49,210
are all over it no one's actually going

1468
01:00:46,838 --> 01:00:50,529
and using it and you've got operators

1469
01:00:49,210 --> 01:00:51,818
that coming in and kind of doing their

1470
01:00:50,530 --> 01:00:55,510
own thing and setting their whole rules

1471
01:00:51,818 --> 01:00:57,818
and and that might be that's a kind of

1472
01:00:55,510 --> 01:01:02,170
interesting thought twos like the SOP

1473
01:00:57,818 --> 01:01:05,139
manual the best way to be creating best

1474
01:01:02,170 --> 01:01:09,400
practices I think that SOP manual is

1475
01:01:05,139 --> 01:01:12,068
there to kind of be the backbone the the

1476
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:13,450
history of how the building's gonna be

1477
01:01:12,068 --> 01:01:15,489
operated but then what gets put into

1478
01:01:13,449 --> 01:01:18,759
practice in the business should be

1479
01:01:15,489 --> 01:01:23,439
simplified we've even talked about you

1480
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:26,470
know having there be a you know I pad in

1481
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:29,019
the room that has just the videos on the

1482
01:01:26,469 --> 01:01:30,399
iPad for every part of the process for

1483
01:01:29,019 --> 01:01:32,068
someone to reference because so many

1484
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:34,869
people are learning things off of

1485
01:01:32,068 --> 01:01:37,088
YouTube and online streaming services

1486
01:01:34,869 --> 01:01:39,068
maybe our SOPs should be geared towards

1487
01:01:37,088 --> 01:01:42,308
how people are actually learning these

1488
01:01:39,068 --> 01:01:43,779
days less people are you know learning

1489
01:01:42,309 --> 01:01:45,160
and my I mean I could be wrong but I

1490
01:01:43,780 --> 01:01:48,390
think most people OTT of people are

1491
01:01:45,159 --> 01:01:51,578
learning through online services and

1492
01:01:48,389 --> 01:01:53,019
podcasts like this one and YouTube and

1493
01:01:51,579 --> 01:01:55,839
you need to learn something quick it's a

1494
01:01:53,019 --> 01:01:56,949
lot easier to have it shown to you then

1495
01:01:55,838 --> 01:01:58,509
have to go through and read the

1496
01:01:56,949 --> 01:02:00,429
directions and hope that you're reading

1497
01:01:58,510 --> 01:02:03,549
it correctly and then translating it and

1498
01:02:00,429 --> 01:02:03,940
to reality so maybe we need to be

1499
01:02:03,548 --> 01:02:06,219
looking

1500
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:07,809
and how we structure our SPS depending

1501
01:02:06,219 --> 01:02:11,009
upon what we're writing as a before of

1502
01:02:07,809 --> 01:02:14,170
course but maybe there's a better way of

1503
01:02:11,010 --> 01:02:16,330
having these best practices displayed

1504
01:02:14,170 --> 01:02:17,800
for the staff so that's something that

1505
01:02:16,329 --> 01:02:20,920
I've been kind of playing around with

1506
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:25,090
maybe perhaps turning poetry of plants

1507
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:26,800
in into an instructional company where

1508
01:02:25,090 --> 01:02:29,250
there's videos online to show every part

1509
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:31,890
of these processes for different steps

1510
01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:35,260
it's something that might be interesting

1511
01:02:31,889 --> 01:02:37,449
that's funny cuz for me I tend to move I

1512
01:02:35,260 --> 01:02:39,940
tend to not like videos as much I like

1513
01:02:37,449 --> 01:02:41,379
hearing things you know obviously with

1514
01:02:39,940 --> 01:02:43,990
having a podcast that's something I

1515
01:02:41,380 --> 01:02:46,329
enjoy but I love to read and I love to

1516
01:02:43,989 --> 01:02:49,049
read things and see them visually that

1517
01:02:46,329 --> 01:02:51,309
way but if it's something complicated

1518
01:02:49,050 --> 01:02:53,620
you know like putting together furniture

1519
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:56,320
it would be a great example having a

1520
01:02:53,619 --> 01:02:58,900
visual guide like a video like you said

1521
01:02:56,320 --> 01:03:00,700
is it's pretty handy you know or maybe

1522
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:02,380
it's like mixing up fertilizer that's

1523
01:03:00,699 --> 01:03:04,119
something that is pretty easy to screw

1524
01:03:02,380 --> 01:03:06,550
up off of a set of written instructions

1525
01:03:04,119 --> 01:03:08,710
so I I think that's a great idea

1526
01:03:06,550 --> 01:03:10,810
I do like that yeah and yeah every

1527
01:03:08,710 --> 01:03:14,110
everyone learns different too right so

1528
01:03:10,809 --> 01:03:17,079
some people are better at reading and or

1529
01:03:14,110 --> 01:03:18,640
listening or watching I mean so maybe

1530
01:03:17,079 --> 01:03:21,250
you have to have a combination of all

1531
01:03:18,639 --> 01:03:23,440
three you know to really have it make

1532
01:03:21,250 --> 01:03:28,059
sense and the staff can access it based

1533
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:31,329
on how they prefer to learn you know

1534
01:03:28,059 --> 01:03:33,519
make it easy for them yeah that gets a

1535
01:03:31,329 --> 01:03:35,619
little controversial in terms of what

1536
01:03:33,519 --> 01:03:37,929
they've come up with in in education

1537
01:03:35,619 --> 01:03:39,460
around research and learning but we

1538
01:03:37,929 --> 01:03:40,509
don't need to get into that that was

1539
01:03:39,460 --> 01:03:42,639
sort of something that I did with my

1540
01:03:40,510 --> 01:03:45,010
master's degree but oh really

1541
01:03:42,639 --> 01:03:48,789
yeah I want to get into that can you

1542
01:03:45,010 --> 01:03:51,460
briefly touch well the basics would be

1543
01:03:48,789 --> 01:03:53,079
that you know this idea of sensory

1544
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:54,400
learning that some people are auditory

1545
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:56,799
learners or some people are visual

1546
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:58,450
learners they found when they actually

1547
01:03:56,800 --> 01:04:01,870
did a lot of research on it it didn't

1548
01:03:58,449 --> 01:04:04,929
really play out quite as well as people

1549
01:04:01,869 --> 01:04:06,849
thought so there is something to have to

1550
01:04:04,929 --> 01:04:09,219
having different modalities of teaching

1551
01:04:06,849 --> 01:04:13,269
in terms of the way you explain or teach

1552
01:04:09,219 --> 01:04:15,069
a subject but no one no one is a single

1553
01:04:13,269 --> 01:04:16,179
modality in the way that they learn they

1554
01:04:15,070 --> 01:04:18,130
don't just learn

1555
01:04:16,179 --> 01:04:19,868
from an auditory perspective or from a

1556
01:04:18,130 --> 01:04:25,480
visual perspective or from a sensory

1557
01:04:19,869 --> 01:04:27,220
perspective so it's it's a little it

1558
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:29,139
gets a little more complicated than that

1559
01:04:27,219 --> 01:04:33,038
I guess but it is interesting and I do

1560
01:04:29,139 --> 01:04:36,548
see you know younger generations being

1561
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:38,589
much more focused or more interested in

1562
01:04:36,548 --> 01:04:41,409
watching videos and learning from videos

1563
01:04:38,588 --> 01:04:45,338
than prior generations like like myself

1564
01:04:41,409 --> 01:04:49,179
I guess well I you know my IVA I have a

1565
01:04:45,338 --> 01:04:51,670
nine-year-old son and we you know we do

1566
01:04:49,179 --> 01:04:53,828
a lot of Legos and if you look at the

1567
01:04:51,670 --> 01:04:56,289
Lego instruction manual it's like step

1568
01:04:53,829 --> 01:04:58,450
by step with the picture and with the

1569
01:04:56,289 --> 01:05:00,869
direction of how this is getting put

1570
01:04:58,449 --> 01:05:02,828
together even something I mean and

1571
01:05:00,869 --> 01:05:04,930
anybody can figure out how to put

1572
01:05:02,829 --> 01:05:06,430
together a Lego for the most part so

1573
01:05:04,929 --> 01:05:08,078
maybe there's a combination of those

1574
01:05:06,429 --> 01:05:09,909
things like we were talking about just

1575
01:05:08,079 --> 01:05:11,500
something where people actually can

1576
01:05:09,909 --> 01:05:13,389
access the best practices and the

1577
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:15,309
standards and and they know what the

1578
01:05:13,389 --> 01:05:18,338
standards are because a lot of times

1579
01:05:15,309 --> 01:05:20,528
we're walking on the facility and it

1580
01:05:18,338 --> 01:05:22,659
people don't know and they just end up

1581
01:05:20,528 --> 01:05:24,969
you know they get shown it once or twice

1582
01:05:22,659 --> 01:05:29,649
and then they end up creating their own

1583
01:05:24,969 --> 01:05:32,618
method and dad you know maybe that could

1584
01:05:29,650 --> 01:05:34,680
be a better method or maybe not but

1585
01:05:32,619 --> 01:05:36,970
that's something for the operation

1586
01:05:34,679 --> 01:05:41,108
manager and the operational management

1587
01:05:36,969 --> 01:05:42,848
to decide not a new hire so I just see

1588
01:05:41,108 --> 01:05:44,019
these kinds of things where it's you

1589
01:05:42,849 --> 01:05:46,778
know back to what we were talking about

1590
01:05:44,019 --> 01:05:49,059
as far as lowering the operational costs

1591
01:05:46,778 --> 01:05:53,909
improving quality blowing the cost of

1592
01:05:49,059 --> 01:05:55,930
production and really taking a cue from

1593
01:05:53,909 --> 01:05:57,250
other companies that have been

1594
01:05:55,929 --> 01:05:59,108
successful and that's what I would

1595
01:05:57,250 --> 01:06:02,380
recommend if you're a cannabis

1596
01:05:59,108 --> 01:06:04,298
cultivator well you know a lot of people

1597
01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:07,480
are touring a lot of canvas farms it's

1598
01:06:04,298 --> 01:06:10,028
not the place to find the best

1599
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:14,409
information on agricultural best

1600
01:06:10,028 --> 01:06:16,480
practices like go to a real farm go to

1601
01:06:14,409 --> 01:06:17,769
you know now I wouldn't say cannabis is

1602
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:21,818
not real farm but go to an agricultural

1603
01:06:17,769 --> 01:06:23,829
farm or produce farm that's dialed in

1604
01:06:21,818 --> 01:06:25,239
that's successful see if you can get a

1605
01:06:23,829 --> 01:06:26,528
tour of their facility and see how

1606
01:06:25,239 --> 01:06:27,848
they're doing their processes because

1607
01:06:26,528 --> 01:06:29,318
those are the processes that are going

1608
01:06:27,849 --> 01:06:29,980
to be applied to cannabis in the future

1609
01:06:29,318 --> 01:06:33,639
matters

1610
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:35,740
ooh yeah I see a lot of reluctance from

1611
01:06:33,639 --> 01:06:37,539
people saying that you know the

1612
01:06:35,739 --> 01:06:39,839
horticultural world or the agricultural

1613
01:06:37,539 --> 01:06:42,550
world doesn't understand cannabis and

1614
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:44,500
has frankly been a little bit arrogant

1615
01:06:42,550 --> 01:06:47,200
towards cannabis because it has been a

1616
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:50,019
black market crop in a plant to grow for

1617
01:06:47,199 --> 01:06:52,059
so long but at the end of the day

1618
01:06:50,019 --> 01:06:54,759
there's so much more research in science

1619
01:06:52,059 --> 01:06:58,000
that's that we have this existing body

1620
01:06:54,760 --> 01:07:00,250
of work to pull from if we look at

1621
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:02,320
what's going on you know in commercial

1622
01:07:00,250 --> 01:07:05,289
greenhouses and what's going on on

1623
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:07,119
commercial farms and how they're

1624
01:07:05,289 --> 01:07:09,699
establishing workflows and how they're

1625
01:07:07,119 --> 01:07:11,769
processing plants yes cannabis is a

1626
01:07:09,699 --> 01:07:13,569
special plant in a lot of ways but I

1627
01:07:11,769 --> 01:07:15,730
think in the way that we cultivate it in

1628
01:07:13,570 --> 01:07:18,059
most cases I mean there's some things

1629
01:07:15,730 --> 01:07:20,409
around photoperiod and such and in

1630
01:07:18,059 --> 01:07:22,329
nutrients but overall it's it's another

1631
01:07:20,409 --> 01:07:25,599
plant and I think people get too caught

1632
01:07:22,329 --> 01:07:28,779
up in sort of this spirituality around

1633
01:07:25,599 --> 01:07:31,089
the plant that they don't that they they

1634
01:07:28,780 --> 01:07:32,650
aren't willing to embrace some of the

1635
01:07:31,090 --> 01:07:35,910
knowledge that's already out there or go

1636
01:07:32,650 --> 01:07:40,900
in search of it when when they could

1637
01:07:35,909 --> 01:07:42,819
yeah I I think that's I think that's

1638
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:45,550
because they're afraid that's what I

1639
01:07:42,820 --> 01:07:47,890
think I think it's scary because it's

1640
01:07:45,550 --> 01:07:50,440
not where it's moving into being and

1641
01:07:47,889 --> 01:07:53,079
becoming an actual business and less of

1642
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:55,780
a lifestyle and that's a lot of people

1643
01:07:53,079 --> 01:07:59,289
don't want to let that go and I get it I

1644
01:07:55,780 --> 01:08:01,450
understand that but and and maybe that

1645
01:07:59,289 --> 01:08:04,300
might be true big AG doesn't know how to

1646
01:08:01,449 --> 01:08:07,329
grow cannabis yet I I would say they'll

1647
01:08:04,300 --> 01:08:08,800
figure it out at some point and maybe

1648
01:08:07,329 --> 01:08:10,509
they won't figure it out to the point

1649
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:14,140
that you know how to take away the

1650
01:08:10,510 --> 01:08:15,970
experience and the artisanship that

1651
01:08:14,139 --> 01:08:17,680
these cannabis farmers have developed

1652
01:08:15,969 --> 01:08:21,670
because they absolutely have I mean I

1653
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:23,560
haven't seen too many people coming from

1654
01:08:21,670 --> 01:08:25,420
big AG that can grow the same level of

1655
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:26,950
flower that people that have been

1656
01:08:25,420 --> 01:08:29,020
cultivating and working with the plant

1657
01:08:26,949 --> 01:08:32,528
for 20 years because it is it does

1658
01:08:29,020 --> 01:08:34,210
become like playing an instrument right

1659
01:08:32,529 --> 01:08:36,640
you you're doing it for so long you

1660
01:08:34,210 --> 01:08:39,369
develop six sons you develop a skill set

1661
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:42,460
around it but that's great now let's

1662
01:08:39,369 --> 01:08:43,750
figure out how that artisanship that you

1663
01:08:42,460 --> 01:08:45,819
amazing cannabis cultivate

1664
01:08:43,750 --> 01:08:49,539
have developed in the last 10 years 20

1665
01:08:45,819 --> 01:08:54,009
years 30 years can now be applied within

1666
01:08:49,539 --> 01:08:55,539
the agricultural format so go meet those

1667
01:08:54,009 --> 01:08:58,810
people become friends with them see if

1668
01:08:55,539 --> 01:09:00,489
you can you know in you know bring them

1669
01:08:58,810 --> 01:09:02,890
information they don't know about so

1670
01:09:00,489 --> 01:09:04,989
they will be open to show you guys what

1671
01:09:02,890 --> 01:09:07,119
they're doing and how they're able to

1672
01:09:04,989 --> 01:09:09,250
reduce their costs cuz you're not gonna

1673
01:09:07,119 --> 01:09:11,710
have an opportunity to cultivate

1674
01:09:09,250 --> 01:09:13,060
cannabis if you're still spending six

1675
01:09:11,710 --> 01:09:14,980
hundred seven hundred dollars to produce

1676
01:09:13,060 --> 01:09:17,819
a pound I mean you won't be able to

1677
01:09:14,979 --> 01:09:22,269
survive so we have to just let those

1678
01:09:17,819 --> 01:09:23,830
take off the armor you know let's have

1679
01:09:22,270 --> 01:09:26,620
an open conversation about this being a

1680
01:09:23,829 --> 01:09:28,239
plant the stigma is going away and let's

1681
01:09:26,619 --> 01:09:29,588
figure out a better way of cultivating

1682
01:09:28,239 --> 01:09:30,670
it so the people that I've been working

1683
01:09:29,588 --> 01:09:32,859
with the plant developing the

1684
01:09:30,670 --> 01:09:34,569
artisanship that make it so special can

1685
01:09:32,859 --> 01:09:36,370
stay in the game and that's really what

1686
01:09:34,569 --> 01:09:39,100
I try and help people out with and I'm

1687
01:09:36,369 --> 01:09:43,588
learning how to do that everyday and I'm

1688
01:09:39,100 --> 01:09:47,560
learning from the PhD greenhouse manager

1689
01:09:43,588 --> 01:09:50,519
that grows you know microgreens and I'm

1690
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:53,520
learning that from the humble farmer

1691
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:55,210
that's using KNF living soil

1692
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:57,040
methodologies I mean there's something

1693
01:09:55,210 --> 01:10:00,010
about you to learn from all those people

1694
01:09:57,039 --> 01:10:02,979
and and then you just work on merging

1695
01:10:00,010 --> 01:10:05,199
those worlds finding the similarities of

1696
01:10:02,979 --> 01:10:07,599
where they all can meet and improve

1697
01:10:05,199 --> 01:10:10,840
there's no ceiling to how we can improve

1698
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:12,220
how we cultivate plants at this point

1699
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:14,920
like I don't see the ceiling I think

1700
01:10:12,220 --> 01:10:16,420
there's so much more to what so that's

1701
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:20,380
the real challenge that is how do we

1702
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:23,590
scale these methods or how do we scale

1703
01:10:20,380 --> 01:10:27,730
an artisan farmer in order to stay

1704
01:10:23,590 --> 01:10:31,600
relevant as this industry blows up that

1705
01:10:27,729 --> 01:10:35,439
is a great question and I would go I I'm

1706
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:38,260
gonna reference a lot of what been

1707
01:10:35,439 --> 01:10:41,519
talked about in lean farm is we have to

1708
01:10:38,260 --> 01:10:45,460
scale the cannabis farm we have to know

1709
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:50,260
what the consumer wants to buy right so

1710
01:10:45,460 --> 01:10:52,119
scaling is gonna be partly connected to

1711
01:10:50,260 --> 01:10:54,760
what we're growing and what we're

1712
01:10:52,119 --> 01:10:56,529
growing it for and I don't think we

1713
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:57,519
really know what that is yet I think

1714
01:10:56,529 --> 01:11:00,518
that's being developed

1715
01:10:57,519 --> 01:11:04,989
and why I'm saying that is I'm seeing

1716
01:11:00,519 --> 01:11:06,309
that flowers becoming less valuable on

1717
01:11:04,988 --> 01:11:09,459
the market than all the derivatives

1718
01:11:06,309 --> 01:11:13,809
right so seeing a lot of eight pens a

1719
01:11:09,460 --> 01:11:17,019
lot of you know hash and derivatives and

1720
01:11:13,809 --> 01:11:20,019
variations of hash becoming more popular

1721
01:11:17,019 --> 01:11:21,969
and more convenient for consumption than

1722
01:11:20,019 --> 01:11:25,179
having a jar of flour

1723
01:11:21,969 --> 01:11:27,670
I love cannabis flower it's always

1724
01:11:25,179 --> 01:11:30,340
number one for me I mean I've it's

1725
01:11:27,670 --> 01:11:31,748
something that I love the experience of

1726
01:11:30,340 --> 01:11:33,578
the flower love looking at the flower I

1727
01:11:31,748 --> 01:11:34,920
love smelling the flower but a lot of

1728
01:11:33,578 --> 01:11:36,939
the new people that are coming online

1729
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:40,929
they don't want to go around smelling

1730
01:11:36,939 --> 01:11:43,618
like a flower and also they maybe prefer

1731
01:11:40,929 --> 01:11:47,170
the different delivery methods so

1732
01:11:43,618 --> 01:11:49,359
thinking about that and we have to think

1733
01:11:47,170 --> 01:11:52,118
like well what is the percentage of the

1734
01:11:49,359 --> 01:11:54,279
flower gonna be look what is the retail

1735
01:11:52,118 --> 01:11:57,819
sales a flower going to be as we move

1736
01:11:54,279 --> 01:11:59,349
forward is it gonna be 70% 80% of what

1737
01:11:57,819 --> 01:12:01,210
it's kind of been or is it gonna be more

1738
01:11:59,349 --> 01:12:03,340
like five to ten percent of the market

1739
01:12:01,210 --> 01:12:04,960
so if it ends up going to where I think

1740
01:12:03,340 --> 01:12:06,639
it's going to go it's gonna be a much

1741
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:08,439
smaller margin on the market and we're

1742
01:12:06,639 --> 01:12:11,139
gonna be moving towards these

1743
01:12:08,439 --> 01:12:13,149
derivatives then it doesn't and it

1744
01:12:11,139 --> 01:12:15,190
doesn't matter as much I hate to say it

1745
01:12:13,149 --> 01:12:16,689
but doesn't matter as much is if you're

1746
01:12:15,189 --> 01:12:19,359
producing like these really crazy

1747
01:12:16,689 --> 01:12:21,788
looking flowers so if that's the case

1748
01:12:19,359 --> 01:12:23,408
then you know because those crazy

1749
01:12:21,788 --> 01:12:25,719
looking flowers those amazing beautiful

1750
01:12:23,408 --> 01:12:27,279
flowers take a lot of energy a lot of

1751
01:12:25,719 --> 01:12:28,989
time and a lot of money to produce and

1752
01:12:27,279 --> 01:12:31,238
if people aren't willing to pay a fair

1753
01:12:28,988 --> 01:12:33,189
market price for them and they're not

1754
01:12:31,238 --> 01:12:35,498
gonna be around and that's kind of you

1755
01:12:33,189 --> 01:12:39,879
know what I see if it takes if it costs

1756
01:12:35,498 --> 01:12:44,170
$600 to produce a triple a beautiful top

1757
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:49,900
shelf pound of the most highest level

1758
01:12:44,170 --> 01:12:51,578
flower and you can only sell it for $700

1759
01:12:49,899 --> 01:12:54,578
just like the cost of producing it or

1760
01:12:51,578 --> 01:12:56,139
$800 then it then that flower is gonna

1761
01:12:54,578 --> 01:13:00,908
go away until it can command a higher

1762
01:12:56,139 --> 01:13:03,550
value and what we're gonna see is large

1763
01:13:00,908 --> 01:13:06,189
scale or large scale operations where

1764
01:13:03,550 --> 01:13:07,748
it's not as the focus isn't necessarily

1765
01:13:06,189 --> 01:13:09,248
on the aesthetic of the flower it's

1766
01:13:07,748 --> 01:13:11,500
going to be more on the chemical

1767
01:13:09,248 --> 01:13:14,409
concentrations that can be

1768
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:18,250
produced and how much of it can be

1769
01:13:14,409 --> 01:13:20,738
produced so answering your question if

1770
01:13:18,250 --> 01:13:22,539
we're looking at a derivative market and

1771
01:13:20,738 --> 01:13:24,519
we're producing candidates for a

1772
01:13:22,539 --> 01:13:27,189
derivative market why are we applying

1773
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:29,920
the same methodologies and costly

1774
01:13:27,189 --> 01:13:31,779
methodologies of producing very very

1775
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:34,329
high quality or close to the high

1776
01:13:31,779 --> 01:13:35,889
quality flour if it's just going to be

1777
01:13:34,329 --> 01:13:37,840
turning your derivative in the first

1778
01:13:35,890 --> 01:13:40,119
place so a lot of people haven't thought

1779
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:41,949
about that in my in my opinion my humble

1780
01:13:40,119 --> 01:13:43,630
opinion they've designed these massive

1781
01:13:41,949 --> 01:13:47,738
facilities have cost a lot of money and

1782
01:13:43,630 --> 01:13:49,090
then over half or 70% of all of what

1783
01:13:47,738 --> 01:13:51,759
they're producing is being turned into

1784
01:13:49,090 --> 01:13:54,460
some kind of derivative so if you are

1785
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:56,590
planning your cannabis business and you

1786
01:13:54,460 --> 01:13:57,010
want to grow flour god bless you I love

1787
01:13:56,590 --> 01:13:59,170
it

1788
01:13:57,010 --> 01:14:00,489
keep it going if you have a brand behind

1789
01:13:59,170 --> 01:14:02,469
you even better you'll probably be

1790
01:14:00,488 --> 01:14:05,169
successful more successful about it your

1791
01:14:02,469 --> 01:14:07,149
brand has any kind of market share but

1792
01:14:05,170 --> 01:14:09,340
if you're just getting into this really

1793
01:14:07,149 --> 01:14:11,500
think about what percentage of your

1794
01:14:09,340 --> 01:14:14,020
sales are going to be flower sales and

1795
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:15,609
if you come in same conclusion that I am

1796
01:14:14,020 --> 01:14:18,250
which is that it's going to be lower

1797
01:14:15,609 --> 01:14:20,289
than all the derivatives then build a

1798
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:23,890
facility out with economies of scale in

1799
01:14:20,289 --> 01:14:25,930
place and focus on producing biomass

1800
01:14:23,890 --> 01:14:28,719
that can be turned into derivatives

1801
01:14:25,930 --> 01:14:31,420
which requires a lot less input and

1802
01:14:28,719 --> 01:14:34,359
energy than it does if you're growing

1803
01:14:31,420 --> 01:14:36,850
four flower kind of roundabout answer

1804
01:14:34,359 --> 01:14:38,109
but does that make sense yeah we're

1805
01:14:36,850 --> 01:14:41,200
definitely seeing that here in

1806
01:14:38,109 --> 01:14:43,539
Washington people moving towards more

1807
01:14:41,199 --> 01:14:45,909
concentrates and moving away from flower

1808
01:14:43,539 --> 01:14:48,969
in a lot of ways which I agree with you

1809
01:14:45,909 --> 01:14:50,769
is a little bit unfortunate but it is

1810
01:14:48,969 --> 01:14:53,170
the reality of where the industry is you

1811
01:14:50,770 --> 01:14:55,570
know now you can get cannabis sugar and

1812
01:14:53,170 --> 01:14:57,489
canvas gummies and cannabis chocolate

1813
01:14:55,569 --> 01:14:59,529
and pretty much any of them you know I

1814
01:14:57,488 --> 01:15:02,019
and you have no idea what that plant

1815
01:14:59,529 --> 01:15:03,399
looked like no you have no idea what the

1816
01:15:02,020 --> 01:15:06,010
plant look like you don't know what it

1817
01:15:03,399 --> 01:15:08,500
was grown grown with you don't know the

1818
01:15:06,010 --> 01:15:10,980
quality of the flower all you really are

1819
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:15,039
getting are these constituent

1820
01:15:10,979 --> 01:15:17,709
cannabinoids essentially so yep who

1821
01:15:15,039 --> 01:15:20,859
knows and that's a little scary to me in

1822
01:15:17,710 --> 01:15:22,210
a lot of ways just because you look

1823
01:15:20,859 --> 01:15:22,929
we've already talked about this we don't

1824
01:15:22,210 --> 01:15:24,699
know about

1825
01:15:22,930 --> 01:15:26,890
you know pesticides we don't know about

1826
01:15:24,699 --> 01:15:28,479
heavy metals yes there's some testing

1827
01:15:26,890 --> 01:15:32,170
going on around it but the regulations

1828
01:15:28,479 --> 01:15:35,379
have not cut up with the with the laws

1829
01:15:32,170 --> 01:15:36,850
in a lot of ways so I guess we're just

1830
01:15:35,380 --> 01:15:39,970
gonna have to wait and see how it all

1831
01:15:36,850 --> 01:15:42,340
pans out but there are people still

1832
01:15:39,970 --> 01:15:45,850
growing high quality flour out there you

1833
01:15:42,340 --> 01:15:48,880
know I know quite a few but it is it is

1834
01:15:45,850 --> 01:15:52,030
getting tougher and tougher so the

1835
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:55,180
market is changing yeah and I don't want

1836
01:15:52,029 --> 01:15:57,369
those people to I'm saying this not

1837
01:15:55,180 --> 01:15:59,800
because I like the reality of it it's

1838
01:15:57,369 --> 01:16:03,250
just the reality of it and there are

1839
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:05,140
some amazing cultivators that I'm hoping

1840
01:16:03,250 --> 01:16:07,300
it will swing back the other way

1841
01:16:05,140 --> 01:16:08,560
and then we'll you know at some point

1842
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:09,070
when everything's kind of calmed down a

1843
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:10,630
bit

1844
01:16:09,069 --> 01:16:13,139
there's gonna be a clearly defined

1845
01:16:10,630 --> 01:16:17,230
market for boutique really high-quality

1846
01:16:13,140 --> 01:16:19,300
anibus flour but please if you grow

1847
01:16:17,229 --> 01:16:21,609
really really really awesome epic flour

1848
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:23,829
you are valuable and you're important

1849
01:16:21,609 --> 01:16:25,869
and you're special and that's that's an

1850
01:16:23,829 --> 01:16:28,510
art form in a craft you use your head

1851
01:16:25,869 --> 01:16:30,130
though make smart business decisions so

1852
01:16:28,510 --> 01:16:32,470
five to ten years from now you can

1853
01:16:30,130 --> 01:16:34,779
continue to grow that flower and that

1854
01:16:32,470 --> 01:16:38,199
might mean you have to be a little bit

1855
01:16:34,779 --> 01:16:39,729
nimble on what you want it you know with

1856
01:16:38,199 --> 01:16:41,590
where your direction where your

1857
01:16:39,729 --> 01:16:44,439
trajectory is out with where it should

1858
01:16:41,590 --> 01:16:46,300
be to survive because this is survival

1859
01:16:44,439 --> 01:16:48,339
mode for most cannabis companies right

1860
01:16:46,300 --> 01:16:50,440
now unless you've got hundreds of

1861
01:16:48,340 --> 01:16:52,930
millions of dollars behind you and and

1862
01:16:50,439 --> 01:16:54,519
you can afford the crazy burn rate so

1863
01:16:52,930 --> 01:16:56,409
please if you are one of these craft

1864
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:57,850
growers and I see you all I see these

1865
01:16:56,409 --> 01:16:59,829
flowers all the time and I love it I

1866
01:16:57,850 --> 01:17:02,280
don't want to see them disappear figure

1867
01:16:59,829 --> 01:17:05,619
out how to survive think about a

1868
01:17:02,279 --> 01:17:07,809
longer-term plan and thinking about you

1869
01:17:05,619 --> 01:17:10,000
know what you might have to pivot and

1870
01:17:07,810 --> 01:17:11,920
grow lower quality product that's gonna

1871
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:14,289
go to derivatives just to be able to

1872
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:16,630
keep the business open that is not

1873
01:17:14,289 --> 01:17:18,250
anything you should really stress out

1874
01:17:16,630 --> 01:17:20,230
about you should just be like okay this

1875
01:17:18,250 --> 01:17:21,640
is what I have to do right now trust

1876
01:17:20,229 --> 01:17:24,969
that it's going to come back around the

1877
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:26,890
artisanship will survive but that's only

1878
01:17:24,970 --> 01:17:28,780
gonna survive if the art that the

1879
01:17:26,890 --> 01:17:30,220
artists continue to produce if they all

1880
01:17:28,779 --> 01:17:32,590
get out of the game because it's too

1881
01:17:30,220 --> 01:17:35,530
tough then what are we gonna be left

1882
01:17:32,590 --> 01:17:36,730
with so please you know make smart

1883
01:17:35,529 --> 01:17:38,769
business decisions be okay

1884
01:17:36,729 --> 01:17:40,809
hey with yourself no one's gonna judge

1885
01:17:38,770 --> 01:17:42,430
you if you've got a grow flower for

1886
01:17:40,810 --> 01:17:44,830
derivatives for whatever reason just

1887
01:17:42,430 --> 01:17:47,050
keep going please stick around because

1888
01:17:44,829 --> 01:17:49,689
the art that you've brought to the

1889
01:17:47,050 --> 01:17:51,550
Kansas community is so important and it

1890
01:17:49,689 --> 01:17:53,589
would hurt if all of those people

1891
01:17:51,550 --> 01:17:56,350
disappeared and we just had you know

1892
01:17:53,590 --> 01:17:59,199
massive hedge funds growing and you know

1893
01:17:56,350 --> 01:18:01,270
mid grade product and that was all that

1894
01:17:59,199 --> 01:18:04,000
was available that would I mean that's a

1895
01:18:01,270 --> 01:18:06,489
possibility that's definitely a

1896
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:07,689
possibility and it could be like you

1897
01:18:06,488 --> 01:18:11,109
know the beer industry where it took

1898
01:18:07,689 --> 01:18:14,529
like 30 40 years for craft beer to come

1899
01:18:11,109 --> 01:18:16,149
out to come back into the fold and I

1900
01:18:14,529 --> 01:18:18,729
would just say let's be smart about it

1901
01:18:16,149 --> 01:18:20,738
to keep to keep the artisan growers

1902
01:18:18,729 --> 01:18:23,738
around I think it's really important

1903
01:18:20,738 --> 01:18:27,339
well I know this podcast is cannabis

1904
01:18:23,738 --> 01:18:29,049
cultivation in science but I almost want

1905
01:18:27,340 --> 01:18:31,210
to have someone on to talk about

1906
01:18:29,050 --> 01:18:33,400
marketing and branding because you

1907
01:18:31,210 --> 01:18:35,649
should I want people to survive these

1908
01:18:33,399 --> 01:18:37,420
like artisan growers like you mentioned

1909
01:18:35,649 --> 01:18:39,339
the only ones I know of that are really

1910
01:18:37,420 --> 01:18:42,100
thriving right now or succeeding are the

1911
01:18:39,340 --> 01:18:43,569
ones that have really really strong

1912
01:18:42,100 --> 01:18:46,690
marketing branding and so they've

1913
01:18:43,569 --> 01:18:50,649
captured you know a certain demographic

1914
01:18:46,689 --> 01:18:52,000
of their of their community that is firm

1915
01:18:50,649 --> 01:18:53,170
believers in what they're doing and

1916
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:55,810
they've been able to share the message

1917
01:18:53,170 --> 01:18:59,050
of how they're cultivating with a larger

1918
01:18:55,810 --> 01:19:01,450
audience and unfortunately that's so

1919
01:18:59,050 --> 01:19:03,279
important for companies nowadays and

1920
01:19:01,449 --> 01:19:05,289
it's something that I've had to learn

1921
01:19:03,279 --> 01:19:07,269
the hard way myself with my business I

1922
01:19:05,289 --> 01:19:10,180
was spending way too much time arguing

1923
01:19:07,270 --> 01:19:11,650
obscure scientific references with other

1924
01:19:10,180 --> 01:19:14,200
people online when I should have been

1925
01:19:11,649 --> 01:19:15,699
marketing my business I would be a much

1926
01:19:14,199 --> 01:19:17,769
more successful businessman right now

1927
01:19:15,699 --> 01:19:20,260
and part of starting this podcast was a

1928
01:19:17,770 --> 01:19:23,080
way for me to get some of my message but

1929
01:19:20,260 --> 01:19:24,760
also a greater message of what you know

1930
01:19:23,079 --> 01:19:26,500
the philosophy of people that I believed

1931
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:27,940
in or had access to you out to other

1932
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:29,560
growers so they won't make the same

1933
01:19:27,939 --> 01:19:32,829
mistake with their businesses that I did

1934
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:35,500
so yeah you know learn learn from my

1935
01:19:32,829 --> 01:19:38,470
mistakes too in that regard and really

1936
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:39,970
invest in that as much as much as I hate

1937
01:19:38,470 --> 01:19:41,860
marketing and branding and I have to be

1938
01:19:39,970 --> 01:19:44,619
careful because my fiancee is a

1939
01:19:41,859 --> 01:19:48,039
marketing director here I don't think

1940
01:19:44,619 --> 01:19:49,390
she listens to all my podcasts but it's

1941
01:19:48,039 --> 01:19:49,979
not something that I'm terribly

1942
01:19:49,390 --> 01:19:53,070
passionate

1943
01:19:49,979 --> 01:19:54,630
and you really have to find someone that

1944
01:19:53,069 --> 01:19:56,038
is that's really gonna take your

1945
01:19:54,630 --> 01:19:57,599
business to the next level if you want

1946
01:19:56,038 --> 01:19:59,639
to be successful because there's so many

1947
01:19:57,599 --> 01:20:02,760
aspects around social media now we're a

1948
01:19:59,639 --> 01:20:05,159
global economy and it's so important

1949
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:06,958
that we reach out beyond just our local

1950
01:20:05,158 --> 01:20:08,279
area and people really find out what

1951
01:20:06,958 --> 01:20:10,139
we're what you're doing so even if

1952
01:20:08,279 --> 01:20:12,268
you're limited to a particular state

1953
01:20:10,139 --> 01:20:14,458
with your cultivation getting your

1954
01:20:12,269 --> 01:20:16,050
message out there too is wide of an

1955
01:20:14,458 --> 01:20:19,130
audience as possible is only going to

1956
01:20:16,050 --> 01:20:20,820
help you be more successful absolutely

1957
01:20:19,130 --> 01:20:23,340
absolutely

1958
01:20:20,819 --> 01:20:25,558
and just that not to that's a skill

1959
01:20:23,340 --> 01:20:28,679
that's another skill set and not and

1960
01:20:25,559 --> 01:20:30,360
that's that the thing is sometimes the

1961
01:20:28,679 --> 01:20:33,059
some of the best growers in the world

1962
01:20:30,359 --> 01:20:37,018
they don't know how to do that you know

1963
01:20:33,059 --> 01:20:40,190
and it's it's gonna be a challenge and

1964
01:20:37,019 --> 01:20:44,070
you know maybe there's some kind of a

1965
01:20:40,189 --> 01:20:46,529
boutique grower farm management company

1966
01:20:44,069 --> 01:20:52,590
that could emerge out of all this that

1967
01:20:46,529 --> 01:20:55,679
could help organize organize and create

1968
01:20:52,590 --> 01:20:57,090
a channel or a free way for a lot of

1969
01:20:55,679 --> 01:21:00,479
these boutique growers that just want to

1970
01:20:57,090 --> 01:21:02,309
grow so they can continue to be

1971
01:21:00,479 --> 01:21:04,170
supported successful as long as it was

1972
01:21:02,309 --> 01:21:07,800
done in an ethical way in a responsible

1973
01:21:04,170 --> 01:21:09,599
way and it wasn't some crazy you know

1974
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:10,920
we're gonna control and own everything

1975
01:21:09,599 --> 01:21:12,420
that you're doing kind of thing is I

1976
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:15,449
think it's important that people still

1977
01:21:12,420 --> 01:21:17,940
feel the sense of freedom that they had

1978
01:21:15,448 --> 01:21:19,589
when they were cultivating and in the

1979
01:21:17,939 --> 01:21:23,879
black market I mean there was a freeing

1980
01:21:19,590 --> 01:21:25,380
it was a free feeling to be in there and

1981
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:27,090
not not that I was all a good thing

1982
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:28,109
right like get people spraying a bunch

1983
01:21:27,090 --> 01:21:30,119
of crap and all the plants and

1984
01:21:28,109 --> 01:21:32,429
everything but being in that space where

1985
01:21:30,118 --> 01:21:35,969
you're kind of outside of society and

1986
01:21:32,429 --> 01:21:38,340
you're creating you got like wings that

1987
01:21:35,969 --> 01:21:40,760
that are so large no one can see and

1988
01:21:38,340 --> 01:21:44,219
there's something about that that is

1989
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:46,949
inspiring and then once you get put into

1990
01:21:44,219 --> 01:21:49,109
the system and the structure and you've

1991
01:21:46,948 --> 01:21:52,228
got all these boxes you have to check

1992
01:21:49,109 --> 01:21:54,179
off it can limit that creative

1993
01:21:52,229 --> 01:21:55,889
experience well maybe there's a way of

1994
01:21:54,179 --> 01:21:58,498
still creating that creative experience

1995
01:21:55,889 --> 01:22:01,380
inside of the structure maybe something

1996
01:21:58,498 --> 01:22:03,840
that can be discussed at a further date

1997
01:22:01,380 --> 01:22:05,550
and you know I mean you can kind of

1998
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:08,569
you have some other industries but it's

1999
01:22:05,550 --> 01:22:11,610
hard yeah I know for me with my business

2000
01:22:08,569 --> 01:22:14,130
trying to hire outside help with

2001
01:22:11,609 --> 01:22:16,859
marketing became really really expensive

2002
01:22:14,130 --> 01:22:19,109
and really challenging and I wasted you

2003
01:22:16,859 --> 01:22:20,698
know thousands of dollars on this in

2004
01:22:19,109 --> 01:22:22,559
terms of getting hiring the wrong people

2005
01:22:20,698 --> 01:22:24,569
are not getting what I thought I was

2006
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:27,270
getting out of it or investing in

2007
01:22:24,569 --> 01:22:29,399
avenues that were just not you know

2008
01:22:27,270 --> 01:22:32,310
we're not productive so putting money

2009
01:22:29,399 --> 01:22:35,368
into you know maybe ads wasn't the right

2010
01:22:32,310 --> 01:22:37,590
wasn't the right revenue source or for

2011
01:22:35,368 --> 01:22:38,939
my business and these are all trial and

2012
01:22:37,590 --> 01:22:40,590
error things and it's really really

2013
01:22:38,939 --> 01:22:43,979
tough for a grower especially someone

2014
01:22:40,590 --> 01:22:45,900
without a marketing background to figure

2015
01:22:43,979 --> 01:22:47,939
all of that out and get into the

2016
01:22:45,899 --> 01:22:49,079
industry and figure out whether they

2017
01:22:47,939 --> 01:22:51,269
should be putting their money into

2018
01:22:49,079 --> 01:22:53,368
marketing so that it's the most

2019
01:22:51,270 --> 01:22:55,679
effective and a lot of that's data

2020
01:22:53,368 --> 01:22:57,598
analysis and requires having a lot more

2021
01:22:55,679 --> 01:22:59,699
information than the average grower is

2022
01:22:57,599 --> 01:23:02,429
gonna have you know we're fairly

2023
01:22:59,698 --> 01:23:03,658
insulated in what we do so there's a lot

2024
01:23:02,429 --> 01:23:05,969
of challenges around marketing and

2025
01:23:03,658 --> 01:23:08,429
branding and maybe I will have to have

2026
01:23:05,969 --> 01:23:10,289
someone on to kind of talk about that if

2027
01:23:08,429 --> 01:23:13,500
there's an interest if there's an

2028
01:23:10,289 --> 01:23:14,399
interest please people reach out shoot

2029
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:15,899
me an email let me know if you're

2030
01:23:14,399 --> 01:23:17,908
interested in me talking about that with

2031
01:23:15,899 --> 01:23:19,348
someone but I know we have a lot of

2032
01:23:17,908 --> 01:23:21,269
other people that are just cultivating

2033
01:23:19,349 --> 01:23:23,279
for themselves or on a medical level

2034
01:23:21,270 --> 01:23:27,020
where they don't really need or want

2035
01:23:23,279 --> 01:23:29,099
that information to so uh yeah I think

2036
01:23:27,020 --> 01:23:30,929
there's a good friend of mine who always

2037
01:23:29,099 --> 01:23:33,270
said that everyone in the cannabis

2038
01:23:30,929 --> 01:23:35,760
business you know up until recently has

2039
01:23:33,270 --> 01:23:38,190
been doing business but they haven't

2040
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:40,110
been in business and now we have to be

2041
01:23:38,189 --> 01:23:42,779
in business we can't just be doing

2042
01:23:40,109 --> 01:23:45,509
business so all that I think all that

2043
01:23:42,779 --> 01:23:47,880
information and coaching on that and is

2044
01:23:45,510 --> 01:23:51,179
really important and how it applies to

2045
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:54,750
the cannabis world and how it's being

2046
01:23:51,179 --> 01:23:56,850
shaped you'll be great

2047
