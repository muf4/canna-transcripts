where we discuss The Cutting Edge of

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,820
growing from a science-based perspective

9
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,320
and drawn top experts from around the

10
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,539
industry to share their wisdom and

11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,399
knowledge this week's topic is a bit

12
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:37,200
technical but important for Growers to

13
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:39,359
consider whether you have two plants or

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,280
two thousand my guest this week is

experience with creating and utilizing

17
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,940
standard operating procedures or Sops in

18
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,219
your garden Cassandra is a legacy

19
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:52,378
cannabis cultivator who specializes in

20
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:54,539
commercial scale organic living soil

21
00:00:52,378 --> 00:00:56,698
cultivation she honed her cultivation

22
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:58,558
skills in the early 2000s in Northern

23
00:00:56,698 --> 00:01:00,780
California's Emerald Triangle then

24
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,759
relocated to Colorado to co-found one of

25
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:05,640
Boulder's first licensed dispensaries in

26
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:07,500
2009. since then she has helped clients

27
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,599
across the country establish successful

28
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,519
commercial scale living soil cannabis

medical recreational and celebrity

31
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,920
Brands Cassandra's passion for

32
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,780
sustainability and quality has won

33
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,180
numerous cannabis cups and accolades for

34
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:23,099
her teams and Cassandra was named one of

35

the top 50 women in cannabis by High

36
00:01:23,099 --> 00:01:28,259
Times magazine in 2019. Cassandra was

37
00:01:26,099 --> 00:01:30,780
kind enough to share a sample sop as an

38
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:32,879
example on our podcast page now on to

39
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,739
the show

40
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:36,000
hey Cassandra thanks for coming on the

41
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:38,759
show today

42

00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:42,780
yeah I'm really excited to have you uh

44
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:45,299
can you tell me a little bit about

45
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,280
yourself to share with listeners please

46
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:50,700
please sure yeah I started out as a

47
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:53,099
cultivator in the year 2000 I moved down

48
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:55,520
Humboldt County and there I learned

49
00:01:53,099 --> 00:01:57,978
outdoor cultivation indoor cultivation

50
00:01:55,519 --> 00:02:00,599
eventually I moved to Colorado

51
00:01:57,978 --> 00:02:03,239
to found one of the first vertically

52
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:05,578
integrated licensed cannabis

53
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:08,459
dispensaries there and I've been working

54
00:02:05,578 --> 00:02:11,519
in the industry ever since

55
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:14,280
awesome awesome and you and I have had a

56
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:17,360
lot of uh really enjoyable conversations

57
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:20,580
off air about a variety of topics

58
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:23,280
and one of the things that we talked

59
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:26,879
about that we thought would be would be

60
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,959
a good podcast topic was Sops

61
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:29,459
um

62
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:31,378
there's something that I think are

63
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:34,378
really challenging for a lot of

64
00:02:31,378 --> 00:02:37,679
facilities and Commercial Growers even

65
00:02:34,378 --> 00:02:40,439
having Sops as a home grower I think or

66
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,519
tent grower could be beneficial

67
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:43,739
um

68
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,420
how do you approach something like that

69
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:46,700
can be they can be really daunting for a

70
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:50,039
lot of people

71
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:52,859
yeah I mean so you know so you're

72
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:55,079
absolutely correct that Growers no

73
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:57,480
matter if you were growing in a closet

74
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:01,200
or you're operating a 50 000 square foot

75
00:02:57,479 --> 00:03:04,199
facility just wrapping your head around

76
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:07,259
the processes and the materials that you

77
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:09,238
need for every single cycle

78
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:12,299
um is it's just really hap it's really

79
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:14,519
helpful to just get organized it means

80
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:16,200
you know what the tasks are going to be

81
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:17,640
ahead of you

82
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:19,619
um you know what materials you're gonna

83
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:20,939
need and so you're not in the middle of

84
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,158
trying to do something and you're like

85
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:25,800
oh crap I have to go to the store or

86
00:03:23,158 --> 00:03:27,539
order this thing so you can feel really

87
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:30,300
prepared

88
00:03:27,539 --> 00:03:33,239
um and you know and then another piece

89
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:36,719
to it also is that if you don't really

90
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:40,580
get that basic foundational

91
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:43,439
uh calendar and those processes

92
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:45,659
organized then it's really hard to know

93
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:48,780
when you innovate

94
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:51,479
what whether like what it was that

95
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:53,818
worked for you or didn't work for you

96
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:57,539
um and so you know I think it's really

97
00:03:53,818 --> 00:03:59,818
good to start with a calendar so just

98
00:03:57,539 --> 00:04:02,598
wrap if you if you look at it like your

99
00:03:59,818 --> 00:04:05,000
Sops your standard operating procedures

100
00:04:02,598 --> 00:04:09,000
are a being

101
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:12,239
the calendar is sort of your skeleton so

102
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,060
you want to know exactly how long it

103
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:18,199
takes you to root clones or to germinate

104
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:20,939
seeds and then you want to know okay

105
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:24,600
like I actually break down veg into

106
00:04:20,939 --> 00:04:26,699
three phases and I know exactly how long

107
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,500
those are and I have different things

108
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:31,080
that I'm going to do the plants during

109
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:33,000
that period of time

110
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:35,758
um you know and then I also break flour

111
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,860
down into three separate Cycles or three

112
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,379
three phases

113
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:43,680
um and then I want to know well how long

114
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:45,719
does it take me to harvest how long does

115
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,720
it take me to dry

116
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:51,540
um and then you know what does trimming

117
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:54,540
look like and then how long do I need to

118
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:57,300
cure so you know all in all that gives

119
00:04:54,540 --> 00:05:00,500
you like a great skeleton to start

120
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,500
filling in details

121
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:06,540
Yeah you sort of piqued my interest

122
00:05:03,899 --> 00:05:08,519
um what how do you break down veg and

123
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:10,800
flour into three sections and what are

124
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:13,560
those three sections

125
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,560
and they don't have very uh special

126
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,959
names but okay so you know so in veg I

127
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:22,439
mean there's there's actually four

128
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:25,258
um because I've got my rooting phase

129
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:26,579
um my bed's phase one veg phase two veg

130
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:29,038
phase three

131
00:05:26,579 --> 00:05:31,978
and I like to veg for about eight weeks

132
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:33,538
so I do a really long veg compared to

133
00:05:31,978 --> 00:05:34,620
many people

134
00:05:33,538 --> 00:05:37,500
yeah

135
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:40,680
but in that process

136
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:43,259
um you know veg phase one those are like

137
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,720
little little baby seedlings or little

138
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:48,240
baby baby clones and so they've just

139
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,800
been transplanted I really need to make

140
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,939
sure that they're not getting over

141
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,500
watered

142
00:05:50,939 --> 00:05:54,779
right

143
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:58,019
um they really you know they don't need

144
00:05:54,779 --> 00:06:00,659
any additional nutrients maybe you know

145
00:05:58,019 --> 00:06:03,120
they they do need to be really carefully

146
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:05,280
inspected for pests

147
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,418
um you know there's some basic pruning

148
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:08,159
and training

149
00:06:06,418 --> 00:06:09,478
um practices that you can do at that

150
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,400
point

151
00:06:09,478 --> 00:06:13,258
um veg phase two is like really really

152
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:15,000
vigorous growth

153
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:17,038
um I need to make sure that during that

154
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,860
period of time if I'm gonna send my

155
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:22,019
plants into flowers I need to make sure

156
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:25,500
that they're totally healthy and pissed

157
00:06:22,019 --> 00:06:28,379
free in that veg phase too

158
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:30,959
because you know as we all know if you

159
00:06:28,379 --> 00:06:32,339
send sick plants into flower you're

160
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:33,899
never going to have a great result with

161
00:06:32,339 --> 00:06:36,239
that

162
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:38,818
um so you know so that really really

163
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:42,660
focuses on like that's where the bulk of

164
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:44,939
the IPM happens for me is that veg phase

165
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:47,460
two and then veg phase three we're

166
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:50,219
resolving anything that might happen in

167
00:06:47,459 --> 00:06:54,120
veg phase two and doing a lot of pruning

168
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:56,819
and training to prepare for transplant

169
00:06:54,120 --> 00:07:00,240
so that makes sense yeah

170
00:06:56,819 --> 00:07:03,060
yeah and you know I I mean breaking it

171
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,699
down into like what you're focusing on

172
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:07,680
in each of those phases I think just

173
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:09,360
makes it easier to know what to

174
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,160
prioritize because because those Growers

175
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,840
like we have a million things that we're

176
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,939
thinking about a million things that we

177
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:18,239
want to do and if you're like right my

178
00:07:14,939 --> 00:07:19,680
goal during this phase of growth is

179
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,918
IPM

180
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:25,379
like that's what you're gonna prioritize

181
00:07:22,918 --> 00:07:27,359
like every single day so

182
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:30,120
so that's why I find it helpful and then

183
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,939
you know flower phase one again I need

184
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:36,538
to do any additional pruning during that

185
00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:39,360
phase before pistols emerge

186
00:07:36,538 --> 00:07:43,199
um and and so I'm making sure that my

187
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,520
canopies you know I grow in giant raised

188
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,800
soil beds

189
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:48,719
um like even a lot of your listeners and

190
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,360
so I need to make sure that that entire

191
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:54,840
canopy is prepared to be productive and

192
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,400
filled out and even during the veg phase

193
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:57,119
one

194
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:00,060
um

195
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:03,360
and then veg phase two we're just making

196
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:05,339
sure or excuse me flower phase two

197
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,740
um you know again that's a really really

198
00:08:05,339 --> 00:08:10,198
vigorous growth and so I'm looking for

199
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:12,840
plant Health cues making sure that

200
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:15,538
there's enough nutrition available to my

201
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:16,918
plants again checking for pests and just

202
00:08:15,538 --> 00:08:19,259
making sure that everything's really

203
00:08:16,918 --> 00:08:22,079
clean and healthy and then that flower

204
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:24,720
phase three is when we're getting ready

205
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:26,818
for the end you know that phase you

206
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,620
really really want to check for

207
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:30,960
um you know particularly if you're

208
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:34,019
growing a greenhouse botrytis or

209
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:36,299
Outdoors checking for botritis checking

210
00:08:34,019 --> 00:08:38,399
for any clues that

211
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:40,259
your plants might need to come down a

212
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:44,839
little early or might be going a little

213
00:08:40,259 --> 00:08:44,838
bit later so um so that's kind of how

214
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,300
that makes sense I can see that

215
00:08:48,659 --> 00:08:54,419
um and so I guess it's not so much about

216
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:57,179
how long each phase is but just having

217
00:08:54,419 --> 00:09:00,778
something in your head that syncs up

218
00:08:57,179 --> 00:09:02,338
with your cultivation schedule

219
00:09:00,778 --> 00:09:04,320
um because like you said not everyone

220
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:06,060
veggies for eight weeks for example but

221
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,700
you could do the exact same thing on a

222
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:11,039
shorter timeline I would assume and get

223
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:12,180
similar results

224
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:14,639
um

225
00:09:12,179 --> 00:09:17,639
provided that works so

226
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:19,139
as you're creating your sop so I

227
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:20,399
sorry I'm all over the place here a

228
00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:22,139
little bit but

229
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,820
um I I think about the fact like when I

230
00:09:22,139 --> 00:09:26,519
walk into a facility it's very easy to

231
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:28,080
get distracted and so if you don't have

232
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:31,019
a list of things that you need to

233
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:33,720
accomplish that day or that week it'd be

234
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:34,320
very easy to forget to do it

235
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,759
um

236
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:41,580
how do you go about sort of

237
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:44,039
prioritizing those things on your sop as

238
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:46,560
you're as you're building it out

239
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:49,019
what's sort of your framework for that

240
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:52,018
so the framework

241
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:55,320
um I I don't know if if you're familiar

242
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:58,200
with Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of me

243
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:00,778
it's applied to humans

244
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:04,500
apply it to any living organism at all

245
00:10:00,778 --> 00:10:07,139
and so you know obviously

246
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:10,019
that food Water Shelter

247
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:11,879
or environmental stability you know for

248
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:13,799
your plants is going to be the most

249
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:17,299
important thing

250
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:20,519
um I think superseding anything else

251
00:10:17,299 --> 00:10:21,659
it's helpful to begin with a daily walk

252
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:24,419
through

253
00:10:21,659 --> 00:10:27,778
and you're looking for you know number

254
00:10:24,419 --> 00:10:30,000
one is there anything that's come up

255
00:10:27,778 --> 00:10:33,299
and in cultivation like automated

256
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,958
watering systems break all the time

257
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:37,879
um you know uh I mean air conditioning

258
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:40,559
units

259
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:42,958
dehumidifiers all these things are like

260
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:45,179
constantly breaking for us because we

261
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:47,578
use them so so hard

262
00:10:45,179 --> 00:10:49,979
cultivation so

263
00:10:47,578 --> 00:10:51,599
um each day needs to begin with a daily

264
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:53,399
walk through

265
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,420
and then you're just determining okay

266
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:56,759
like

267
00:10:54,419 --> 00:11:01,439
do my plants have enough food and water

268
00:10:56,759 --> 00:11:01,980
and is or the environmental conditions

269
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,680
um

270
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:05,339
acceptable for for

271
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:07,319
me

272
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:10,320
um those things obviously need to be

273
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:13,500
addressed first and foremost

274
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,899
um beyond that I do have like I flesh

275
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:18,720
out the calendar so

276
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:21,059
I actually you know I give to my grow

277
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:24,180
team like a harvest batch notebook which

278
00:11:21,059 --> 00:11:26,819
fills in every single day like

279
00:11:24,179 --> 00:11:29,099
okay so if we're going to be hand

280
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:32,278
watering you know there are these three

281
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:34,560
days that those you know

282
00:11:32,278 --> 00:11:37,679
that that Growers are scheduled to water

283
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:40,559
however they know that if the soil is

284
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:44,039
too wet you need to push it to the next

285
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:46,259
day we have these floating tasks that

286
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:48,899
you know are those Basics from you know

287
00:11:46,259 --> 00:11:52,620
again it's really just providing you

288
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:53,339
know food water filter for our plants

289
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:56,759
um

290
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:59,220
and then if an emergency comes up and we

291
00:11:56,759 --> 00:12:01,559
'd shift around a day or two

292
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:02,820
um there are other things where we know

293
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:03,479
that

294
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,640
um

295
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:08,100
you know we don't want to be doing a lot

296
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:11,278
of pruning like in the middle of flower

297
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:13,139
for instance like I've seen that really

298
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:16,700
stress plants out

299
00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:19,199
um you know overall lower productivity

300
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:21,300
lower yields

301
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,019
um you know hermaphrodites in the worst

302
00:12:21,299 --> 00:12:25,019
case

303
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:28,078
so I want to make sure that that all

304
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:30,720
that is done before

305
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:33,539
um really you know day 21 is like the

306
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:37,259
last day of flower that that would allow

307
00:12:33,539 --> 00:12:39,480
any significant printing to be happening

308
00:12:37,259 --> 00:12:41,338
um and so that's again on the calendar

309
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,778
and it's good to think about those

310
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:46,440
things I mean so if you break it into

311
00:12:42,778 --> 00:12:49,078
chunks you know okay so you know from a

312
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:51,600
Seedling or a rooted clone you're going

313
00:12:49,078 --> 00:12:53,939
to need to transplant it by this day

314
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,379
if you don't the roots are going to

315
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:57,060
start you know especially with clones

316
00:12:55,379 --> 00:12:59,399
they're going to start tangling and

317
00:12:57,059 --> 00:13:01,679
braiding with one another and that

318
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:03,419
causes all kinds of problems later on so

319
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:06,239
you just put it in your calendar okay

320
00:13:03,419 --> 00:13:10,259
okay so and in an ideal situation

321
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:15,299
I would be transplanting a clone you

322
00:13:10,259 --> 00:13:17,458
know between the 10th and the 12th day

323
00:13:15,299 --> 00:13:19,620
and so you know that's on your calendar

324
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:22,319
whether it's printed calendar or dry

325
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:24,360
erase or on your phone or whatever it's

326
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,639
there ahead of time so you know the week

327
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:28,560
before that you're prepared with all of

328
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,000
your materials and and you kind of wrap

329
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:33,419
your head around okay well what are the

330
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,399
things that I need I need so many you

331
00:13:33,419 --> 00:13:38,179
know eye transplant directly into three

332
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:41,339
gallon pots in bed and then they go into

333
00:13:38,179 --> 00:13:44,458
the raised beds and flower

334
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:47,700
and so I know I need x amount of three

335
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:50,099
gallon pots I need this much soil it's

336
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:52,139
calculated how much soil is going to be

337
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:53,459
in each pot

338
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:55,320
um and this is what I'm going to be

339
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:57,599
watering in with this is the tea that I

340
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:00,480
brew and this is what I'll be watering

341
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:03,000
watering so on the day of you know in

342
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,220
that 10 to 12th day I have all the

343
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,799
materials right there

344
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:10,019
and I know what to do and I and I've got

345
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:12,659
folks helping me then I can say you know

346
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:15,179
everybody's trained in the same sop so

347
00:14:12,659 --> 00:14:17,399
we talk about it go over it for you know

348
00:14:15,179 --> 00:14:19,199
just a couple minutes

349
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:21,480
um make sure that whoever's working with

350
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:23,759
you is empowered to know exactly what

351
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,980
that process is and then we can all just

352
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:29,000
like work together bust it out

353
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:29,000
no stress

354
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:33,359
so

355
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:36,419
so what I'm hearing is you're you're

356
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:39,480
kind of using a calendar system

357
00:14:36,419 --> 00:14:41,458
uh with important dates on the calendar

358
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:44,519
but then it sounds like you're also

359
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:46,939
referencing some sort of document that

360
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:49,919
has maybe more details in it or

361
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:52,639
step-by-step instructions on some of

362
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:55,500
these you know essential tasks like

363
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:58,980
transplanting watering

364
00:14:55,500 --> 00:15:02,698
scouting things like that

365
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:06,600
correct yeah so I mean so every single

366
00:15:02,698 --> 00:15:10,799
process every single task that we do in

367
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:13,980
the garden should have its own sop

368
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:17,338
um and then you can compile that into

369
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:20,459
your sop manual that has I mean my sap

370
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:23,279
manual will have like over 350 different

371
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:25,078
singular Sops

372
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:27,778
um and obviously that's not something

373
00:15:25,078 --> 00:15:29,719
that that most Growers will ever even

374
00:15:27,778 --> 00:15:33,899
need to do like that level of

375
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:36,839
specificity but if you start doing this

376
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:38,399
for a really long time or or leading a

377
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:40,860
pretty large team you want to make sure

378
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:43,620
that that all of that knowledge is is

379
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:46,379
just in one place so if I'm gonna draft

380
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:47,879
a singular sop let's say for

381
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:49,679
transplanting

382
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:50,759
the first thing that I'm going to have

383
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:53,039
on there

384
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:55,259
would be

385
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:57,360
um when it needs to happen

386
00:15:55,259 --> 00:15:59,458
so that time when I'm saying okay with

387
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:04,560
the Clone I need to make sure that that

388
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:05,638
is you know between they 10 12.

389
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:08,638
um

390
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:11,698
and these are the materials that I need

391
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:13,198
so I list all of the materials that are

392
00:16:11,698 --> 00:16:16,198
needed

393
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:18,299
um also I mean things like specifying

394
00:16:16,198 --> 00:16:21,719
okay so if you're going to be

395
00:16:18,299 --> 00:16:23,639
transplanting clones I specify that that

396
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:26,040
hose needs to be clean

397
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:28,860
you know I mean that's like one of those

398
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:30,899
things where if someone was just reading

399
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:33,600
your sop

400
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:35,639
um what if they take a filthy garden

401
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,699
hose that's been outside

402
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:42,299
or you know something that just hasn't

403
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:45,419
been clean uh you know a bunch it's had

404
00:16:42,299 --> 00:16:49,620
some uh you know

405
00:16:45,419 --> 00:16:52,198
maybe old water from a nutrient feed and

406
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:55,679
a you know like who knows there's like

407
00:16:52,198 --> 00:16:57,539
some old kelp water stuck in that pose

408
00:16:55,679 --> 00:17:00,479
we could really mess things up if the

409
00:16:57,539 --> 00:17:03,179
hose isn't clean so all of your

410
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,818
materials and then specify like anything

411
00:17:03,179 --> 00:17:09,119
that you know might be special about

412
00:17:05,818 --> 00:17:12,779
that clean scissors are also a good one

413
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:15,958
not just any old grubby uh pair of

414
00:17:12,779 --> 00:17:19,500
scissors and then I go okay step one

415
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:22,740
unplug the cloner you know evaluate the

416
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:25,140
roots uh take an inventory of you know

417
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:27,599
how many plants you have

418
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:30,780
um then it goes into you know making

419
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:33,359
sure that the pots are labeled

420
00:17:30,779 --> 00:17:36,298
um this is how we prepare the soil this

421
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:38,339
is the inoculant that we use

422
00:17:36,298 --> 00:17:40,558
um and then going into every step of

423
00:17:38,339 --> 00:17:43,798
transplanting

424
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:47,819
um and so that could be just a single

425
00:17:43,798 --> 00:17:50,700
one-page document if you're not a person

426
00:17:47,819 --> 00:17:52,980
um I go into a deep dive to make sure

427
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:54,900
that if I was across the country someone

428
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:57,660
could read this and understand like

429
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:59,400
every little potential pitfall

430
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:01,860
that you could experience while

431
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:04,380
transplanting like you open up a bag of

432
00:18:01,859 --> 00:18:06,959
soil and it's hydrophobic that happens

433
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:10,200
sometimes well then you need to stop and

434
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:12,240
so I say okay stop at this phase

435
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:16,319
plug the cloner back in and this and

436
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:20,419
then go to this sop to um you know

437
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:20,418
rehydrate the soil and then return

438
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:26,159
so you yours are pretty extensive from

439
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,240
what I'm hearing

440
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,058
um

441
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:32,579
which may or may not be necessary

442
00:18:29,058 --> 00:18:34,319
depending on uh the type of grow that

443
00:18:32,579 --> 00:18:36,779
you have or the facility or your

444
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:40,678
personality but um it certainly doesn't

445
00:18:36,779 --> 00:18:42,960
hurt I I do think though that having a

446
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:45,059
system that's replicable like you're

447
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,400
saying so everyone what even if it's

448
00:18:45,058 --> 00:18:49,200
just you are transplant the same way and

449
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,880
thinking through that process you may

450
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,019
find you can cut steps out or there's

451
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,900
things that you were doing that you

452
00:18:52,019 --> 00:18:58,679
didn't need to do but also if you do it

453
00:18:54,900 --> 00:19:02,220
the same every time now you have an the

454
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:03,960
ability to compare data sets and say

455
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:06,120
okay well this cycle

456
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,440
I transplant this way well if the next

457
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:09,839
cycle you transplant a different way

458
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,880
it's really hard to know what kind of

459
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:14,459
differences in results what they're

460
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:16,799
related to I guess so I do really like

461
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:19,400
that aspect of of Sops I think that's

462
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:19,400
really important

463
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:24,839
yeah yeah exactly I mean and that's

464
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:25,798
um you know I'm sure that that's

465
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:29,759
something

466
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:32,279
also that your team experiences

467
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:36,660
when doing like any sort of crop

468
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:39,538
consultation with Growers is that um

469
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:42,298
you can help people who really know what

470
00:19:39,538 --> 00:19:44,339
their Baseline is

471
00:19:42,298 --> 00:19:46,440
um if you understand what all of their

472
00:19:44,339 --> 00:19:49,918
inputs are because they know what they

473
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:52,919
are they you know it's written down

474
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:56,038
to you then that makes it a lot easier

475
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:59,340
for you to say okay well I can see where

476
00:19:56,038 --> 00:20:02,819
you maybe went wrong here maybe this is

477
00:19:59,339 --> 00:20:05,699
why we're you know seeing a crazy amount

478
00:20:02,819 --> 00:20:08,639
of magnesium pop up

479
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:12,480
in your soil or whatever it is you know

480
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:17,520
or this is what seems like pH has just

481
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:19,140
you know uh plummeted and you know it

482
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:22,019
seems like gosh you've got a lot of

483
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:24,900
nitrogen in your soil so

484
00:20:22,019 --> 00:20:26,819
if you know what that Baseline is it

485
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:30,298
makes it a lot easier for people to help

486
00:20:26,819 --> 00:20:32,460
you when you run into trouble

487
00:20:30,298 --> 00:20:34,740
um no that's that's a really good point

488
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:35,660
yeah I love that because coming in from

489
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:39,058
the outside

490
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:41,640
mid-cycle and getting a list of

491
00:20:39,058 --> 00:20:44,220
everything that's been been added as an

492
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:46,980
input is really helpful in trying to

493
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:50,940
figure out what's going on

494
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:52,919
um so yeah absolutely I I 100 agree with

495
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:54,960
that

496
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:56,759
I mean and then there are you know some

497
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:00,000
additional things too that I think

498
00:20:56,759 --> 00:21:03,000
sometimes people forget

499
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:06,419
um you know they're that when you're

500
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:09,058
talking about ferments you know and

501
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:11,880
um you know I I think a lot of your

502
00:21:09,058 --> 00:21:14,160
listeners and and certainly you know you

503
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:18,120
and me might prefer

504
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:20,700
to have the bulk of nutrition be present

505
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:24,298
in the soil from the beginning

506
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:27,058
um but then when you get into adding uh

507
00:21:24,298 --> 00:21:30,418
you know liquid feeds whether that's I

508
00:21:27,058 --> 00:21:32,399
mean teas even dilute teas have like

509
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:35,400
substantial

510
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:37,320
you know nutritive content and and

511
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,700
oftentimes like if you've gathered a

512
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:40,259
bunch of plants

513
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:42,600
and your horsetail and you've got you

514
00:21:40,259 --> 00:21:45,119
know this and that and rose hips and

515
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:47,219
like you know whoever you know who knows

516
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:50,658
what else it can be really difficult

517
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:50,659
then to understand

518
00:21:51,058 --> 00:21:55,678
um

519
00:21:51,779 --> 00:21:57,658
okay so like how do we how do we move in

520
00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:00,000
the right direction if if you don't even

521
00:21:57,659 --> 00:22:02,340
know exactly what what has been in those

522
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,259
teas or those ferments you know as

523
00:22:02,339 --> 00:22:05,639
additional component

524
00:22:04,259 --> 00:22:09,658
um and I've noticed like when I've

525
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:12,600
worked with various teams they might

526
00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:16,500
give me their feed schedule

527
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:19,319
but it doesn't even include those teas

528
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:22,079
and so it's like an additional just wild

529
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:24,779
card that hasn't really been accounted

530
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:26,399
for the idea is that it's good for

531
00:22:24,779 --> 00:22:29,399
biology

532
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:32,100
but there's more to it than that so you

533
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:33,538
know and some people like in the case of

534
00:22:32,099 --> 00:22:36,779
um you know

535
00:22:33,538 --> 00:22:38,579
fpj or something like that maybe the

536
00:22:36,779 --> 00:22:41,038
Growers harvesting different input

537
00:22:38,579 --> 00:22:42,599
materials every single time with a

538
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:45,298
really varied results well it's going to

539
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:47,699
be difficult for me or for you your team

540
00:22:45,298 --> 00:22:50,579
to come in and say

541
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:52,980
okay I know how that affected everybody

542
00:22:50,579 --> 00:22:55,259
um you know and half the time we won't

543
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:57,900
if it isn't any Sops if it's not

544
00:22:55,259 --> 00:22:59,700
referenced directly it makes it even

545
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,960
harder

546
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:02,759
foreign

547
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,798
yeah I think you bring up a really

548
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:08,460
important point in the sense that these

549
00:23:04,798 --> 00:23:10,139
a lot of T's and ferments do bring in a

550
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:12,000
level of mineral nutrition that people

551
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:13,679
don't account for and so if we're

552
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,538
accounting for the total load of

553
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:17,460
nitrogen for example that we think a

554
00:23:15,538 --> 00:23:19,798
plant is going to need in its life cycle

555
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:21,419
and then you add a bunch of teas well

556
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:23,700
like you said that's going to drop the

557
00:23:21,419 --> 00:23:25,740
pH maybe outside of a range that we want

558
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:28,140
it's going to provide more nitrates than

559
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:30,599
we may want the plant to have at various

560
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:32,059
stages and could limit uptake of other

561
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:34,500
nutrients so

562
00:23:32,058 --> 00:23:36,538
all of these things have a place and I'm

563
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:39,000
not against them but it's important to

564
00:23:36,538 --> 00:23:40,679
account for them and you realize that as

565
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,779
you add more of these things you are

566
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:44,820
adding more variability and so when you

567
00:23:42,779 --> 00:23:47,759
do have a problem going back and looking

568
00:23:44,819 --> 00:23:49,319
at the 10 different T applications you

569
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:52,099
made it's really hard to determine what

570
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:54,418
was beneficial and what cause problems

571
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:56,639
so I always like to start from a

572
00:23:54,419 --> 00:23:57,960
baseline that's very simple you know as

573
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,759
little as possible sometimes I'm like

574
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,140
hey just just start with water get an

575
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:03,000
idea for how the soil is going to

576
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:05,340
perform and then

577
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,159
add from there you know one at a time

578
00:24:05,339 --> 00:24:09,779
and get an idea of if this thing if this

579
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,360
is beneficial or not and then figure out

580
00:24:09,779 --> 00:24:14,220
what the limiting factor of plant growth

581
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:16,558
it is that this is actually addressing

582
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:18,179
you know if you're adding calcium and

583
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:21,240
you already have sufficient calcium then

584
00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:23,820
it's not doing you any favors

585
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:26,339
so you really have to watch that

586
00:24:23,819 --> 00:24:29,519
yeah I mean and and I mean wouldn't it

587
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:31,558
be cool to start out with okay let's you

588
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:35,158
know you've you know even in a small

589
00:24:31,558 --> 00:24:37,678
like grow tent you could go ahead and do

590
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:40,260
a side by side essentially using like

591
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:43,500
two or three different Sops at the same

592
00:24:40,259 --> 00:24:47,519
time okay so you know I'm gonna have the

593
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:49,679
water only bed here and I'm going to you

594
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:52,279
know utilize

595
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:55,140
um you know these T's in the second one

596
00:24:52,279 --> 00:24:57,779
and you know and this and the third one

597
00:24:55,140 --> 00:25:00,840
and so you know I I love that idea of

598
00:24:57,779 --> 00:25:04,500
starting really simple and just adding

599
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:07,379
from that but I think you know it can be

600
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:10,919
so difficult if we don't write these

601
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:13,320
things down if we don't collect data you

602
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:15,538
know from every single thing we've done

603
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:18,359
through a harvest it's so hard to go

604
00:25:15,538 --> 00:25:20,640
back later and know what you did

605
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:24,240
it's really hard to keep track of that

606
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:26,038
even even if it's in a grow tent

607
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,538
absolutely I think it's important to

608
00:25:26,038 --> 00:25:30,058
keep track of

609
00:25:27,538 --> 00:25:32,579
um when you water if you're hand

610
00:25:30,058 --> 00:25:34,500
watering what those days are to track

611
00:25:32,579 --> 00:25:36,240
that and you may be surprised with how

612
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,619
that ends up if you're actually tracking

613
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,558
the plant you may be surprised with how

614
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:42,959
that correlates to your plant health I

615
00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:44,639
like to also track like you said every

616
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:48,840
application that you're making of any

617
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:51,600
microbial or nutrient or spray

618
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:54,000
um you know track when you prune track

619
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:55,798
your scouting and and keep track of any

620
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,359
insect pressures that you see because

621
00:25:55,798 --> 00:26:00,179
all of that information is really

622
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:01,979
helpful over time in figuring out what's

623
00:26:00,179 --> 00:26:03,360
going on and and how you can improve

624
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:05,759
things

625
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:08,459
absolutely I mean and it can be as

626
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:11,579
high-tech or as low-tech as you want you

627
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:14,100
know it for a bunch of years like a dry

628
00:26:11,579 --> 00:26:15,480
erase calendar was enough for me you

629
00:26:14,099 --> 00:26:17,639
know you can get those dry erase

630
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:20,278
calendars that are you know three or

631
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:23,220
four months long and then it's like okay

632
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:25,679
so at the beginning of my Harvest cycle

633
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:28,740
I'm like right so I'm cloning from you

634
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:30,659
know here to here and there's enough

635
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:33,058
room to just write like a couple little

636
00:26:30,659 --> 00:26:35,700
notes on that dry erase calendar about

637
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:38,819
what I actually did so in one color I've

638
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:40,798
got what I plan to do in another color

639
00:26:38,819 --> 00:26:43,019
you know I write down what I actually

640
00:26:40,798 --> 00:26:44,639
did and then at the end of the Harvest

641
00:26:43,019 --> 00:26:46,019
you can just take a picture with your

642
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,179
phone

643
00:26:46,019 --> 00:26:51,058
um so that would be like an ultra

644
00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:53,700
low-tech way of doing it but then if

645
00:26:51,058 --> 00:26:54,960
you've got a question like six months

646
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:56,940
later

647
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,400
then you can just like pull it up in

648
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:00,960
your phone and be like oh yeah that's

649
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:04,400
what I did and that's what worked or

650
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,400
that's what didn't work I think

651
00:27:05,579 --> 00:27:09,119
yeah there's a lot of tools out there

652
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,100
um

653
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:13,379
they're not all helpful or necessary

654
00:27:11,099 --> 00:27:15,719
it's really a balance I've found over

655
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:17,520
with with my business at kiss

656
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:19,919
um like we use slack and that works

657
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:21,658
really well for us but that doesn't it

658
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:23,159
it works well for day-to-day

659
00:27:21,659 --> 00:27:25,020
communication but it doesn't work well

660
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:27,419
for tracking things so if I need to

661
00:27:25,019 --> 00:27:28,379
follow up with someone uh two weeks from

662
00:27:27,419 --> 00:27:30,960
now

663
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:32,100
that's not a very good tool or if

664
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,079
there's something I want to look at and

665
00:27:32,099 --> 00:27:38,119
then come back to later it's not very

666
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:41,038
useful so we use a combination of slack

667
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:43,139
uh either a Google Calendar or Apple

668
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:44,700
calendar some sort of calendar where we

669
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:46,100
can put things on there that'll send us

670
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:48,720
alerts

671
00:27:46,099 --> 00:27:50,639
and then uh

672
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:53,460
I guess those are our main things and

673
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:56,940
then we have Sops as a separate document

674
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:59,038
that we keep and then if it were a grow

675
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:00,120
I would want another document to track

676
00:27:59,038 --> 00:28:01,679
all of the things that you're talking

677
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:03,178
about just putting putting it into a

678
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:05,038
database but I don't want to collect

679
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:07,919
data just for the sake of collecting

680
00:28:05,038 --> 00:28:11,038
data I want to have an idea prior to

681
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:12,480
starting any plans of what I'm going

682
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:15,179
what I want to collect data for like

683
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,558
what the goals are for that data so I

684
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:17,880
can make sure that it's usable and I'm

685
00:28:16,558 --> 00:28:19,139
not just wasting my time too

686
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:21,659
[Music]

687
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:26,460
yeah I mean and and perhaps you know

688
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:29,039
like a helpful way to do that is

689
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:31,440
um you know so you collect all this data

690
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:35,460
during the course of of a harvest bash

691
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:37,798
and then you want ultimately you know at

692
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:40,500
the end everybody's going to know okay

693
00:28:37,798 --> 00:28:42,599
this was my yield and this was the

694
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:45,720
overall quality and so those are two

695
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:46,980
like super super basic things that were

696
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:49,860
you know Growers are going to pay

697
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:52,740
attention to every single time

698
00:28:49,859 --> 00:28:55,199
um you know if you're a home grower you

699
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:57,480
don't necessarily have you know access

700
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,700
to potency testing or things like that

701
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:03,240
but obviously if you're a commercial

702
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:06,058
grower you will and so you know at the

703
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:08,339
end of of every Harvest I sit down with

704
00:29:06,058 --> 00:29:10,440
my team and I say you know we review

705
00:29:08,339 --> 00:29:12,599
that Harvest batch notebook so

706
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:14,820
everything every single thing we did and

707
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:16,678
then we say okay so we have been

708
00:29:14,819 --> 00:29:18,658
tracking the yields of all these

709
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:21,840
different strains so you know in any

710
00:29:18,659 --> 00:29:23,940
given facility and you know I work with

711
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:25,619
a number of different facilities but in

712
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:28,558
every single one where we're keeping

713
00:29:25,619 --> 00:29:31,319
data on you know this strain and what

714
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:34,019
its average yield is and so if I say you

715
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:37,759
know we'll shoot like our average yield

716
00:29:34,019 --> 00:29:41,940
like went down you know by

717
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:45,538
uh you know so many grams per square

718
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:47,700
foot this round like let's let's look at

719
00:29:45,538 --> 00:29:49,558
why and we could say oh well it's just

720
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:52,140
an environmental thing because we can

721
00:29:49,558 --> 00:29:54,058
see here okay the air conditioning broke

722
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:55,620
from you know this time to this time

723
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:57,000
plant Health stuff where it was

724
00:29:55,619 --> 00:30:00,119
documented

725
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:02,099
okay well that makes sense you know we

726
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:04,019
can evaluate some other things

727
00:30:02,099 --> 00:30:05,699
um but then we're also gonna to track

728
00:30:04,019 --> 00:30:07,679
soil tests

729
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:09,840
um I think it's really important

730
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:13,679
especially if you're reusing your media

731
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:16,798
to test you know I like to send in soil

732
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:19,440
tests at least like seven to ten days

733
00:30:16,798 --> 00:30:21,778
before Harvest so I kind of get this is

734
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:24,298
what the end of harvest looks like and

735
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:26,880
then once I've reamended

736
00:30:24,298 --> 00:30:29,460
um then I can also send at the beginning

737
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:31,559
of the next batch I can get a sense for

738
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:33,720
like okay I've reamended and this is

739
00:30:31,558 --> 00:30:36,298
what the soil test looks like

740
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:39,058
so comparing those and then if you're

741
00:30:36,298 --> 00:30:41,700
seeing like some sort of

742
00:30:39,058 --> 00:30:44,579
normal your soil test results that's

743
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:47,120
another I mean hopefully you can catch

744
00:30:44,579 --> 00:30:47,119
that before

745
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:52,620
but again you know if you see an anomaly

746
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:55,079
in your results

747
00:30:52,619 --> 00:30:58,759
then you can go ahead and look back

748
00:30:55,079 --> 00:30:58,759
through your data to understand why

749
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,740
that sounds great yeah so

750
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:06,659
um

751
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:10,558
maybe the next question I would have

752
00:31:06,659 --> 00:31:12,659
around Sops would be where do you where

753
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:14,759
do you start like if you didn't have if

754
00:31:12,659 --> 00:31:16,559
you had a blank page and you were

755
00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:19,558
thinking about starting this process

756
00:31:16,558 --> 00:31:22,139
where would you start

757
00:31:19,558 --> 00:31:25,200
definitely start with that calendar

758
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:27,538
so and then you need to to just mentally

759
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:30,058
walk yourself through

760
00:31:27,538 --> 00:31:32,940
every single thing that you do

761
00:31:30,058 --> 00:31:36,058
throughout the course of a harvest

762
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:38,940
um you know and and you can even start

763
00:31:36,058 --> 00:31:40,319
on the fly like as you're like okay so

764
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:42,960
you've never written anything down

765
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:45,418
before okay well with your next Harvest

766
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:47,880
batch start you know

767
00:31:45,419 --> 00:31:49,740
okay so today I'm cloning and these are

768
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:51,419
the things that I'm doing

769
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:54,359
and you just make sure that you write it

770
00:31:51,419 --> 00:31:58,020
down you know and then you know okay and

771
00:31:54,359 --> 00:32:01,379
it's Tuesday I walked through you know I

772
00:31:58,019 --> 00:32:05,220
evaluated the ph and the you know cloner

773
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:07,440
or I you know where I checked for roots

774
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:08,640
on the peat plug or you know whatever it

775
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,798
is

776
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,538
and so you're just you just write down

777
00:32:10,798 --> 00:32:15,359
what you do

778
00:32:12,538 --> 00:32:17,700
um and then it makes it you know really

779
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:19,740
easy for the next time to just look

780
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:20,940
through and be like okay so this is what

781
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:22,319
you know

782
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:24,298
this is what my schedule is going to

783
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:26,278
look like and then just every time you

784
00:32:24,298 --> 00:32:27,778
can like add a little bit of detail here

785
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:29,640
and there

786
00:32:27,778 --> 00:32:31,440
um something comes to mind it's you know

787
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:33,000
it's really easy to just add something

788
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,659
in

789
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,220
um

790
00:32:33,659 --> 00:32:37,260
you know again you can do something

791
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:39,480
really simple and just have it be on a

792
00:32:37,259 --> 00:32:42,179
dry erase calendar but you know I have a

793
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:45,599
Word document for mine

794
00:32:42,179 --> 00:32:47,159
um just because it makes it easy to you

795
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:48,298
know edit

796
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:51,899
um share

797
00:32:48,298 --> 00:32:53,879
uh and and uh you know just keeps it a

798
00:32:51,898 --> 00:32:56,759
little bit more organized you know and

799
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:58,620
I've got a a table of contents that I

800
00:32:56,759 --> 00:33:00,798
can just click through exactly what I

801
00:32:58,619 --> 00:33:00,798
need

802
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:07,440
yeah have you had a chance to read uh

803
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:10,259
the lean Farm by Ben Hartman or um any

804
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:13,440
of the lean manufacturing stuff with

805
00:33:10,259 --> 00:33:14,759
Toyota coming out of Japan I yeah I I

806
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,580
I've read

807
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:18,720
um you know the well I've read The Lean

808
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:22,500
Startup

809
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:24,659
um the the lean Farm uh is is on my my

810
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:27,599
list to read

811
00:33:24,659 --> 00:33:30,419
okay yeah that book was really great for

812
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:33,000
me because I was familiar with sort of

813
00:33:30,419 --> 00:33:34,620
lean principles but I couldn't figure

814
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,798
out how it really applied to cultivation

815
00:33:34,619 --> 00:33:40,798
and been applying it to a small Market

816
00:33:37,798 --> 00:33:43,139
Farm Really allowed it to click for me

817
00:33:40,798 --> 00:33:44,339
and I didn't interview with him years

818
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:46,320
ago now

819
00:33:44,339 --> 00:33:48,778
um and he's got a lot of resources out

820
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:51,058
there but the highlights for me that

821
00:33:48,778 --> 00:33:51,599
really stuck were

822
00:33:51,058 --> 00:33:55,859
um

823
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:57,719
thinking about efficiency so mapping how

824
00:33:55,859 --> 00:34:01,079
like for example if there's a task that

825
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:03,538
I'm doing uh let's say transplanting how

826
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:05,879
many steps am I taking you know moving

827
00:34:03,538 --> 00:34:07,859
throughout the facility to have to get

828
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:10,858
all the materials together you know is

829
00:34:07,859 --> 00:34:12,358
my is my soil in one place and the pots

830
00:34:10,858 --> 00:34:14,398
over here and I'm constantly having to

831
00:34:12,358 --> 00:34:16,679
take extra steps so they he makes like a

832
00:34:14,398 --> 00:34:18,179
spaghetti diagram of all of your all the

833
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:20,220
steps you take in a day kind of drawn

834
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:22,320
out to complete a task and I thought

835
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:24,898
that was really interesting

836
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,039
um another thing that he he looked at

837
00:34:24,898 --> 00:34:28,019
was

838
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:30,539
um

839
00:34:28,019 --> 00:34:33,179
oh how do we how do we take these

840
00:34:30,539 --> 00:34:35,820
principles and apply them

841
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:37,200
specifically to a farm thing so he has a

842
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:38,639
whole mobile stand that goes around with

843
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:39,838
him that has all the tools that he's

844
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:42,539
going to need to complete that task

845
00:34:39,838 --> 00:34:44,159
whether it's harvesting lettuce or

846
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:46,559
transplanting and so those those things

847
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:49,320
all stay together and then he has photos

848
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:51,719
up so you could walk into an area and

849
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:54,599
see a picture of what that area is

850
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:56,219
supposed to look like when it's clean so

851
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:58,380
that at the end of the day anyone who

852
00:34:56,219 --> 00:35:00,000
walks up could make that area look

853
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:01,140
exactly how it's supposed to and so

854
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,659
you're always starting from the same

855
00:35:01,139 --> 00:35:05,460
point too and those those key thing

856
00:35:03,659 --> 00:35:07,379
metrics were like really helpful for me

857
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:09,059
in thinking about how I might do a

858
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:12,420
better job of

859
00:35:09,059 --> 00:35:14,880
you know setting up processes and Sops

860
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:17,400
well and I think that also brings up a

861
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:19,880
really good point about that we'll be

862
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:24,539
more and more relevant the Cannabis is

863
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:27,119
GMP or good manufacturing practices or

864
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:29,219
good agricultural practices Gap

865
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:31,559
certification

866
00:35:29,219 --> 00:35:33,598
um where you don't double back so like

867
00:35:31,559 --> 00:35:36,059
it's an efficiency thing too but it's

868
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:39,359
also you know really important for Pest

869
00:35:36,059 --> 00:35:42,119
Management and reducing

870
00:35:39,358 --> 00:35:44,460
facilities is to make sure that your

871
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:46,619
processes you're not doubling back

872
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:49,320
constantly because not only does that

873
00:35:46,619 --> 00:35:52,140
waste your time and you know take more

874
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:54,420
effort but it also you know if you're in

875
00:35:52,139 --> 00:35:56,519
an area that has some sort of like

876
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:59,460
significant pest pressure and then

877
00:35:56,519 --> 00:36:02,099
you're moving into you know

878
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:03,900
and then back and then you know into

879
00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:06,000
your Nursery

880
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:08,160
um then you're basically spreading

881
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,679
contamination throughout your facility

882
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:13,559
so

883
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:15,358
absolutely we always want to start in

884
00:36:13,559 --> 00:36:17,880
our areas that need to stay the cleanest

885
00:36:15,358 --> 00:36:20,039
or that are our cleanest and end the day

886
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:21,420
in places that are the dirtiest or can

887
00:36:20,039 --> 00:36:22,858
afford to be

888
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,579
the dirtiest

889
00:36:22,858 --> 00:36:26,880
um

890
00:36:23,579 --> 00:36:30,240
meaning our mother plants and our veg

891
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:32,940
plants cloning those have to be pest

892
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:35,939
free there's just no way to have a good

893
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:37,440
facility otherwise and then moving

894
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:38,880
through the rest of the rest of the

895
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,920
place if you have if you know you have

896
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,539
thrips in room three that's the very

897
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:44,099
last place that you want to visit at the

898
00:36:42,539 --> 00:36:46,019
end of the day so you're not like you

899
00:36:44,099 --> 00:36:48,300
said doubling back

900
00:36:46,019 --> 00:36:52,380
um and and it's just very inefficient

901
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:54,240
like I I had a seven Acre Farm and I

902
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:55,680
would walk around that thing so much

903
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:56,459
because I'd get to the back and be like

904
00:36:55,679 --> 00:36:58,259
okay

905
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:59,760
I want to weed this area back here and I

906
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:01,380
get back there and be like oh shoot I

907
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,640
forgot my bucket now I gotta walk all

908
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:04,858
the way back up to the front I get back

909
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:07,379
up there and like oh I forgot my you

910
00:37:04,858 --> 00:37:09,480
know something and so I'm doing 10

911
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:11,940
minutes 15 minutes of walking just to

912
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:14,880
complete a silly task or start a task

913
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:16,920
that could have been really avoided and

914
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:19,440
I'll be honest like uh now I think about

915
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:21,480
it with everything I do even at home now

916
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,920
I'll be like okay and and this is fine

917
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:25,199
I'll be like

918
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:27,059
um all right my toilet paper I want to

919
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:30,118
keep near my toilet like I don't want it

920
00:37:27,059 --> 00:37:31,980
on the other side of of the space

921
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:33,780
because that's just inefficient so I can

922
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:36,119
take five steps to get that toilet paper

923
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:37,740
instead of you know 20 depending on

924
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:39,180
where it is in my house and like all of

925
00:37:37,739 --> 00:37:40,739
these things can just be made more

926
00:37:39,179 --> 00:37:42,899
efficient if we just take a moment to

927
00:37:40,739 --> 00:37:45,239
think about about them and I love that

928
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:48,920
but we both have toddlers so you know

929
00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:48,919
that toilet paper could be anywhere

930
00:37:49,139 --> 00:37:52,199
very true

931
00:37:50,699 --> 00:37:55,980
very true

932
00:37:52,199 --> 00:37:58,078
um yeah and you know and your life does

933
00:37:55,980 --> 00:38:00,059
not have to be hyper efficient but I do

934
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:02,880
think you know the things that we can do

935
00:38:00,059 --> 00:38:04,858
to make our cultivation facility

936
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:07,619
um more efficient it is

937
00:38:04,858 --> 00:38:09,299
is crucial especially when you have so

938
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:11,180
many different things going on all the

939
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:13,560
time throughout the day

940
00:38:11,179 --> 00:38:15,358
which is another reason why these Sops

941
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:17,099
are so important because you really do

942
00:38:15,358 --> 00:38:18,659
have to prioritize your time or the next

943
00:38:17,099 --> 00:38:20,880
thing you know you'll end up spending

944
00:38:18,659 --> 00:38:22,279
half the day doing something that wasn't

945
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:25,380
even on your list

946
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:26,579
and you don't have the ability so let's

947
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:28,260
say you're

948
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:29,640
let's say your air conditioner breaks

949
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:31,500
well now you're being pulled away from

950
00:38:29,639 --> 00:38:34,319
all the things that were on your mental

951
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:36,179
checklist of things to do if you have an

952
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:38,519
sop you can hand those off to someone

953
00:38:36,179 --> 00:38:40,379
else to complete your list so you can go

954
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:42,059
deal with the air conditioner and that's

955
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:43,320
just really common I feel like in

956
00:38:42,059 --> 00:38:45,960
commercial facilities you're always

957
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:48,420
putting out fires so the more

958
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:50,940
organization you have the better

959
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:53,700
yeah you know and and I think the beauty

960
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:56,159
about being able to hand off your Sops

961
00:38:53,699 --> 00:38:58,739
to someone too is that

962
00:38:56,159 --> 00:39:01,159
um it can also show your team that you

963
00:38:58,739 --> 00:39:01,159
trust them

964
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:08,460
um like so I saw so often

965
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:11,520
you know in the early days of uh

966
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:13,500
licensed commercial cultivation I

967
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:17,699
noticed that so many of my peers were

968
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:20,579
like jealously guarding their knowledge

969
00:39:17,699 --> 00:39:22,799
um and so they have these teams who you

970
00:39:20,579 --> 00:39:25,560
know maybe worshiped this like grower

971
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:27,140
like a guru they were so amazing you

972
00:39:25,559 --> 00:39:30,719
know but at the end of the day like

973
00:39:27,139 --> 00:39:33,000
these people weren't learning how to run

974
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:34,679
facilities themselves you know

975
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,800
ultimately they were going to be limited

976
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:39,179
by this teacher gatekeeper who was not

977
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,560
going to entrust them with key

978
00:39:39,179 --> 00:39:41,879
information

979
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:43,500
there's always going to be a little

980
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:45,539
secretive they could never really know

981
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:48,539
the secret sauce

982
00:39:45,539 --> 00:39:52,559
um you know and and think about what

983
00:39:48,539 --> 00:39:53,820
what kind of culture that creates in

984
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:55,078
your facility

985
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:55,680
you know

986
00:39:55,079 --> 00:39:57,720
um

987
00:39:55,679 --> 00:39:59,219
I know that traditionally you know a lot

988
00:39:57,719 --> 00:40:02,159
of teachers have really jealously

989
00:39:59,219 --> 00:40:04,078
guarded their knowledge but

990
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:07,199
um I know I've really enjoyed working

991
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:10,140
with my teams because you know as they

992
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:12,480
move up and they're able to take care of

993
00:40:10,139 --> 00:40:14,219
their own facility or let's say it means

994
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,920
that I get to step away and work on

995
00:40:14,219 --> 00:40:19,439
another project because this person over

996
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:22,260
here is now you know proficient enough

997
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:25,099
and skilled enough to take the simple

998
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:27,900
Foundation of Sops that that I created

999
00:40:25,099 --> 00:40:31,079
and then they can run their own garden

1000
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:32,460
over here you know and in many cases you

1001
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:35,280
know they can add a couple things that

1002
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:38,699
that make it their own but um I think

1003
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:40,980
having a culture of empowered people who

1004
00:40:38,699 --> 00:40:43,439
are actually able to help you when

1005
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:46,639
you're putting out fires or you know or

1006
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:50,280
just be able to you know as a teacher

1007
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:51,719
enjoy seeing people learning new things

1008
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:53,820
and

1009
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:56,879
um you know and maybe looking at an sop

1010
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:58,740
and being like hey could we maybe change

1011
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,838
this one thing I think it would be more

1012
00:40:58,739 --> 00:41:02,819
efficient to do this

1013
00:41:00,838 --> 00:41:04,619
you know and sometimes you'll be like no

1014
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:08,280
that won't work but other times you'll

1015
00:41:04,619 --> 00:41:09,960
be like yeah yeah that would you know it

1016
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:12,420
would be so much more efficient if we

1017
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:15,720
did it this way and so I think having

1018
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:17,400
extra pairs of eyes on your Sops can be

1019
00:41:15,719 --> 00:41:20,959
a really beautiful thing too and it's

1020
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:20,960
not something to be afraid of

1021
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:28,440
yeah I agree with that I will say that

1022
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:30,240
being a good grower does not necessarily

1023
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:33,059
mean that you're a good teacher or a

1024
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:34,979
good manager like I know one of my

1025
00:41:33,059 --> 00:41:36,719
limitations is I'm not good at managing

1026
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:39,599
large groups of people when we had the

1027
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:42,358
farm fully running with 20 25 people on

1028
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:43,800
staff that wasn't a skill set that I

1029
00:41:42,358 --> 00:41:44,400
really excelled at

1030
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,859
um

1031
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:48,720
and and so

1032
00:41:46,858 --> 00:41:51,420
yeah I don't want to say that All

1033
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:52,799
Growers don't jealously guard their Sops

1034
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:54,480
I think some Growers just aren't as

1035
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:57,000
organized and some Growers are just very

1036
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:58,139
intuitive and you know can walk into a

1037
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,519
room and see what needs to be done

1038
00:41:58,139 --> 00:42:01,199
because they have this mental checklist

1039
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:03,179
but they haven't taken the time to

1040
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:04,379
necessarily organize it or get it onto

1041
00:42:03,179 --> 00:42:06,059
paper

1042
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:08,280
um which is sort of what you're talking

1043
00:42:06,059 --> 00:42:12,420
about is if you have if you have that

1044
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:14,640
tool it's a very useful tool

1045
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:16,680
to be able to share with a team for for

1046
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:19,679
Growers that aren't you know head

1047
00:42:16,679 --> 00:42:21,419
Growers or running a facility

1048
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:24,118
and it is empowering to be able to share

1049
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:25,858
that totally well and and actually I

1050
00:42:24,119 --> 00:42:29,338
mean you know like

1051
00:42:25,858 --> 00:42:31,858
I'm old school and so in you know in the

1052
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:35,338
early days of cultivation

1053
00:42:31,858 --> 00:42:37,858
um what we had like Jorge Cervantes book

1054
00:42:35,338 --> 00:42:40,380
which was like the only piece of

1055
00:42:37,858 --> 00:42:42,239
information you know really had

1056
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:43,680
available to us and then you know okay

1057
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:46,139
we could

1058
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:49,440
um you know take information from

1059
00:42:46,139 --> 00:42:53,219
unrelated crops and integrate them into

1060
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:55,619
our cultivation system but you know no

1061
00:42:53,219 --> 00:42:57,539
one was there's there's no soil testing

1062
00:42:55,619 --> 00:43:00,059
happening

1063
00:42:57,539 --> 00:43:02,460
um you know they're you know we were

1064
00:43:00,059 --> 00:43:05,219
working blind and so a lot of it for me

1065
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:07,639
was intuitive for many many years and I

1066
00:43:05,219 --> 00:43:11,459
got along like that you know just great

1067
00:43:07,639 --> 00:43:12,480
until I had to lead a team and I think

1068
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:15,480
that

1069
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:17,699
um you know if I had one message to

1070
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:19,800
aspiring cultivators people who really

1071
00:43:17,699 --> 00:43:22,159
really want to do this

1072
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:26,160
as a career in which they can retire

1073
00:43:22,159 --> 00:43:28,199
you're going to need to be able to take

1074
00:43:26,159 --> 00:43:31,139
those you know take your your knowledge

1075
00:43:28,199 --> 00:43:33,659
your skill set and get it organized

1076
00:43:31,139 --> 00:43:35,400
enough that you can share with other

1077
00:43:33,659 --> 00:43:39,779
people

1078
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:42,960
um I do I guess caution cultivators once

1079
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:45,359
you if if you draft your Sops and then

1080
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:47,280
you're offered your dream job don't sign

1081
00:43:45,358 --> 00:43:50,940
away your IP

1082
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:51,660
to whatever company recruits you

1083
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:53,760
um

1084
00:43:51,659 --> 00:43:57,598
you can there are a bunch of ways in

1085
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:59,400
your contract that you can share that IP

1086
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:02,099
with them

1087
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:03,119
um you know you can usually get some

1088
00:44:02,099 --> 00:44:05,760
money

1089
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:07,400
front in your contract for supplying

1090
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:11,220
those Sops

1091
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:13,559
but don't uh don't give up your right to

1092
00:44:11,219 --> 00:44:16,439
use them in any way you want to in the

1093
00:44:13,559 --> 00:44:19,799
future that would be my one caution

1094
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:23,960
where in that particular case you should

1095
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:23,960
be careful of what you share with people

1096
00:44:25,318 --> 00:44:30,358
yeah two thoughts on that so one I

1097
00:44:27,838 --> 00:44:32,519
totally agree and I think that Sops have

1098
00:44:30,358 --> 00:44:34,739
value as in monetary value because

1099
00:44:32,519 --> 00:44:38,159
there's a lot of time and energy and

1100
00:44:34,739 --> 00:44:41,039
experience there's a lot of failures and

1101
00:44:38,159 --> 00:44:42,719
and wins that go into creating your Sops

1102
00:44:41,039 --> 00:44:45,559
for for anyone that's gone through that

1103
00:44:42,719 --> 00:44:48,239
process and that has value

1104
00:44:45,559 --> 00:44:51,000
whether whether it's yours or mine or

1105
00:44:48,239 --> 00:44:53,239
you know even if you're in a tent and so

1106
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:56,099
I think that's important to protect that

1107
00:44:53,239 --> 00:44:58,559
I will say though that

1108
00:44:56,099 --> 00:45:00,599
as a commercial facility if you're

1109
00:44:58,559 --> 00:45:03,179
looking for someone because you want

1110
00:45:00,599 --> 00:45:05,099
help with Sops you can't just go buy an

1111
00:45:03,179 --> 00:45:07,739
off-the-shelf sop and think it's going

1112
00:45:05,099 --> 00:45:09,660
to work perfectly in your facility there

1113
00:45:07,739 --> 00:45:12,118
there's so many intricacies to every

1114
00:45:09,659 --> 00:45:14,098
facility that makes them different that

1115
00:45:12,119 --> 00:45:16,380
I think some like broad Strokes

1116
00:45:14,099 --> 00:45:17,940
absolutely a lot of that stuff's going

1117
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:19,920
to be the same but but individually

1118
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:22,200
there's just too many little things that

1119
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:24,180
need to be kind of dialed in at your

1120
00:45:22,199 --> 00:45:25,980
facility

1121
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:29,519
I mean what do you think about that oh

1122
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:33,838
100 yeah I mean because for sure like

1123
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:38,519
the Sops that I use in I mean it's a

1124
00:45:33,838 --> 00:45:40,559
little bit more similar in like an

1125
00:45:38,519 --> 00:45:43,139
indoor facility to an indoor facility

1126
00:45:40,559 --> 00:45:45,659
but then indoor to Greenhouse is you

1127
00:45:43,139 --> 00:45:48,299
have to make a ton of adjustments but

1128
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:49,980
even if you're working in like a very

1129
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:54,300
similar

1130
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:56,940
um you know a similar facility to indoor

1131
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:58,920
facilities for instance the HVAC is

1132
00:45:56,940 --> 00:46:02,280
going to be different

1133
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:04,380
so you know in facility a let's say

1134
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:06,240
that's like some old ghetto

1135
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:09,420
infrastructure

1136
00:46:06,239 --> 00:46:11,519
and the Sops need to be built all the

1137
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:14,338
processes that we do are sort of

1138
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:17,420
compensating for that

1139
00:46:14,338 --> 00:46:21,000
um HVAC that could die at any moment

1140
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:23,639
whereas like okay facility B it's state

1141
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,679
of the art things you know it's just

1142
00:46:23,639 --> 00:46:27,420
been built out

1143
00:46:25,679 --> 00:46:30,419
um you know if you see as different

1144
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:33,240
lighting is different and they're gonna

1145
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:34,019
need to be a bunch of adjustments made

1146
00:46:33,239 --> 00:46:36,719
um

1147
00:46:34,019 --> 00:46:38,818
you know even so I think that there are

1148
00:46:36,719 --> 00:46:41,719
a number of things that can stay the

1149
00:46:38,818 --> 00:46:44,818
same but yeah it's it's it's it's it's

1150
00:46:41,719 --> 00:46:49,318
important never to fall asleep at the

1151
00:46:44,818 --> 00:46:52,679
wheel thinking you've got the SOP the

1152
00:46:49,318 --> 00:46:54,960
SOP manual uh to rule all others because

1153
00:46:52,679 --> 00:46:57,000
even if you get it really right in one

1154
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:59,880
system there's always something you can

1155
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:03,300
do better and I think you know again now

1156
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:05,940
that we have information or access to so

1157
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:07,980
much more data we can especially with

1158
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:09,659
living soil Growers we can hone our

1159
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:11,818
system better and better all the time

1160
00:47:09,659 --> 00:47:14,818
because I mean like I'm still learning

1161
00:47:11,818 --> 00:47:18,059
puns I've basically been running a

1162
00:47:14,818 --> 00:47:20,039
system that's it's very similar

1163
00:47:18,059 --> 00:47:23,039
for 20 years

1164
00:47:20,039 --> 00:47:24,900
but you know even so it's like I'm

1165
00:47:23,039 --> 00:47:26,519
learning more and more and more all the

1166
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:29,099
time and integrating that into the

1167
00:47:26,519 --> 00:47:31,818
system so it's really important not to

1168
00:47:29,099 --> 00:47:31,818
get complacent

1169
00:47:32,338 --> 00:47:36,299
oh absolutely I'm learning new things

1170
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:37,500
every day that's what I love about this

1171
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:40,680
industry

1172
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:41,579
um and I think it makes it makes me a

1173
00:47:40,679 --> 00:47:46,199
better

1174
00:47:41,579 --> 00:47:47,579
grower or cultivator over time as I as I

1175
00:47:46,199 --> 00:47:49,559
keep learning so your Sops are

1176
00:47:47,579 --> 00:47:50,880
constantly evolving document like you

1177
00:47:49,559 --> 00:47:53,039
said I think that's important for people

1178
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:54,660
to think about and then one other thing

1179
00:47:53,039 --> 00:47:56,699
that I think that we haven't touched on

1180
00:47:54,659 --> 00:47:58,980
that I think is important is having an

1181
00:47:56,699 --> 00:48:01,259
sop around every type of pest so once

1182
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:04,500
you've properly identified

1183
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:06,359
fungus gnats root aphids fusarium

1184
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:11,159
whatever it is that you're dealing with

1185
00:48:06,358 --> 00:48:15,000
having a a targeted Plan before

1186
00:48:11,159 --> 00:48:16,920
this happens is really really helpful so

1187
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:19,260
you're not just feeling not only just

1188
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:21,059
overwhelmed and behind the gun but you

1189
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:22,500
you have a plan moving forward that

1190
00:48:21,059 --> 00:48:24,599
you've already sort of established as a

1191
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:27,599
team or even just for yourself

1192
00:48:24,599 --> 00:48:32,099
yeah I mean you know and and even better

1193
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:33,720
is if you can provide visuals just like

1194
00:48:32,099 --> 00:48:35,880
you were talking it's like you know

1195
00:48:33,719 --> 00:48:39,480
providing a picture of a room that's

1196
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:41,760
clean I mean I think uh you know if if

1197
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:43,920
you can provide your team with a visual

1198
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:45,119
like this is what a fungus gnat looks

1199
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:47,220
like

1200
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:50,160
um you know I even had some pictures

1201
00:48:47,219 --> 00:48:53,219
it's like this is a fungus gnat it looks

1202
00:48:50,159 --> 00:48:54,659
like a you know it it if you're not

1203
00:48:53,219 --> 00:48:57,000
looking closely it can look like an

1204
00:48:54,659 --> 00:48:59,279
aphid here are the different pictures

1205
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:01,858
like here's you know how you can

1206
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:04,200
properly identify this

1207
00:49:01,858 --> 00:49:07,078
um and then yeah having an sop for like

1208
00:49:04,199 --> 00:49:10,919
okay so if any pest is found we're going

1209
00:49:07,079 --> 00:49:13,200
to like I call it you know Code Orange

1210
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:16,260
um anything arises it's like okay so

1211
00:49:13,199 --> 00:49:18,239
immediately we're gonna be more hygienic

1212
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:20,220
as we move throughout the facility we're

1213
00:49:18,239 --> 00:49:22,559
going to be suiting up we're gonna be

1214
00:49:20,219 --> 00:49:25,078
extra careful about our tools

1215
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:27,420
um things like that but then yeah having

1216
00:49:25,079 --> 00:49:30,539
having those Sops for every single test

1217
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:34,079
or pathogen that comes up is it's it

1218
00:49:30,539 --> 00:49:36,420
just makes it so much easier to respond

1219
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:38,579
and you know if you're catching this in

1220
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:41,220
like flower you only have so much time

1221
00:49:38,579 --> 00:49:43,380
to respond you know and and also there's

1222
00:49:41,219 --> 00:49:46,519
how you might respond and veg versus how

1223
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:46,519
you might respond in flower

1224
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:50,339
oh yeah very different you have very

1225
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:52,920
limited tools

1226
00:49:50,338 --> 00:49:55,318
by the time you get to you know flower

1227
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:56,818
or even your mid flower you're pretty

1228
00:49:55,318 --> 00:49:58,380
much done spraying at that point so

1229
00:49:56,818 --> 00:50:01,800
there's not a lot of things that you can

1230
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:04,140
use in Your Arsenal so keeping pest

1231
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:06,420
pressure low up until that point is is

1232
00:50:04,139 --> 00:50:09,960
crucial

1233
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:12,480
yeah I mean and and it's sort of a side

1234
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:14,818
note and not as related to

1235
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:17,338
um you know I actually put this in my

1236
00:50:14,818 --> 00:50:19,980
Sops for

1237
00:50:17,338 --> 00:50:21,858
um potential clients so they're building

1238
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:24,480
our facility

1239
00:50:21,858 --> 00:50:28,139
for clients guide them through that

1240
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:30,358
process and one of those components is I

1241
00:50:28,139 --> 00:50:32,059
highly recommend each if you could do it

1242
00:50:30,358 --> 00:50:35,460
each

1243
00:50:32,059 --> 00:50:39,119
flowering Harvest batch should be in its

1244
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:42,619
own room or Bay if at all possible

1245
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:45,358
because then if a pest arises in flower

1246
00:50:42,619 --> 00:50:47,280
yeah you shouldn't be spraying you just

1247
00:50:45,358 --> 00:50:49,380
you just shouldn't

1248
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:51,540
um you know regardless of whether you

1249
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:53,579
know a certain

1250
00:50:51,539 --> 00:50:56,639
pesticide or fungicide has been approved

1251
00:50:53,579 --> 00:50:57,900
for use or not there are just so many

1252
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:58,920
there's so many things that we don't

1253
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:02,338
know

1254
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:06,599
um and I'm not sure that I'm

1255
00:51:02,338 --> 00:51:10,078
um you know entirely confident in

1256
00:51:06,599 --> 00:51:13,318
um the safety of pesticides that are

1257
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:16,200
combusted and what those might do and

1258
00:51:13,318 --> 00:51:17,639
and how they've been evaluated so

1259
00:51:16,199 --> 00:51:20,098
um in any case I think you know best

1260
00:51:17,639 --> 00:51:22,980
practice Don't Spray and flower you know

1261
00:51:20,099 --> 00:51:24,838
certainly not when you have

1262
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:27,059
um you know significant Pistols that

1263
00:51:24,838 --> 00:51:29,578
have already emerged and then if a pest

1264
00:51:27,059 --> 00:51:30,300
rise it rises you can kind of write it

1265
00:51:29,579 --> 00:51:31,940
out

1266
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:34,260
in that case

1267
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:37,440
that's just going to be the very last

1268
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:39,599
room you go to and you might need to to

1269
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:42,179
actually just like harvest in the room

1270
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:44,700
and never you know never take that

1271
00:51:42,179 --> 00:51:46,879
material into your common trim space or

1272
00:51:44,699 --> 00:51:46,879
whatever

1273
00:51:47,519 --> 00:51:53,759
yeah good points good points

1274
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:55,318
well was there anything else around this

1275
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:57,960
topic that you wanted to share that I

1276
00:51:55,318 --> 00:51:59,460
didn't ask you about

1277
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:01,199
um

1278
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:02,338
you know I think

1279
00:52:01,199 --> 00:52:04,259
um

1280
00:52:02,338 --> 00:52:06,719
I think

1281
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:08,220
one of

1282
00:52:06,719 --> 00:52:11,459
um

1283
00:52:08,219 --> 00:52:13,259
the cautionary

1284
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:16,980
the cautionary

1285
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:19,680
um like pieces I have with Sops and like

1286
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:23,338
so on social media I see a lot of people

1287
00:52:19,679 --> 00:52:26,519
asking for an sop for blank

1288
00:52:23,338 --> 00:52:30,599
and just know that every single system

1289
00:52:26,519 --> 00:52:33,239
is going to be vastly different

1290
00:52:30,599 --> 00:52:36,838
um you know also to be really careful

1291
00:52:33,239 --> 00:52:39,479
because I've seen a number of

1292
00:52:36,838 --> 00:52:42,480
manufacturers

1293
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:45,599
put out information that

1294
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:49,380
um that isn't accurate and so you know

1295
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:50,760
even in the living soil Community

1296
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:53,640
um you know there are manufacturers

1297
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:56,880
they're probably really well-meaning

1298
00:52:53,639 --> 00:52:59,338
um but they might

1299
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:01,318
um suggest a feed that's really high in

1300
00:52:59,338 --> 00:53:03,358
Arsenic you and I have talked about this

1301
00:53:01,318 --> 00:53:07,279
offline it's like

1302
00:53:03,358 --> 00:53:09,239
there are some inputs out there even by

1303
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:12,059
companies that have like pretty

1304
00:53:09,239 --> 00:53:14,759
significant followings

1305
00:53:12,059 --> 00:53:16,380
um that may cause you to fail for heavy

1306
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:16,920
metals

1307
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:20,220
um

1308
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:23,220
and so don't just trust someone else's

1309
00:53:20,219 --> 00:53:24,838
process ever

1310
00:53:23,219 --> 00:53:26,818
um you know it's really really important

1311
00:53:24,838 --> 00:53:29,460
to evaluate whether it works for your

1312
00:53:26,818 --> 00:53:32,239
system and also just know there's like a

1313
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:35,639
lot of BS out there too that's just

1314
00:53:32,239 --> 00:53:38,399
it's just people you know generating

1315
00:53:35,639 --> 00:53:41,039
content to you know get more followers

1316
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:42,838
more likes and so I think you just need

1317
00:53:41,039 --> 00:53:44,940
to be really Savvy about that and again

1318
00:53:42,838 --> 00:53:48,299
you know even some of those people are

1319
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:51,300
like the cool kids in cannabis and

1320
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:54,059
um you know I think that even though a

1321
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:56,880
lot of uh more mature Growers will say

1322
00:53:54,059 --> 00:53:58,980
like you know I might see these things

1323
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:01,140
and I don't want to call somebody out on

1324
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:04,500
social media but know that there's like

1325
00:54:01,139 --> 00:54:07,500
a huge community of people with a lot

1326
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:10,920
more experience who see these comments

1327
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:12,719
and just sort of cringe because well I

1328
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:15,119
might not personally want to get into a

1329
00:54:12,719 --> 00:54:16,980
battle with somebody about you know this

1330
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:19,440
potentially risky practice that they're

1331
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:22,079
suggesting to Growers

1332
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:25,679
um I see it out there all the time so I

1333
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:27,000
just you know just just

1334
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:29,539
always

1335
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:32,099
keep

1336
00:54:29,539 --> 00:54:34,380
always be cautious about the information

1337
00:54:32,099 --> 00:54:36,539
that you see

1338
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:38,460
um you know that that

1339
00:54:36,539 --> 00:54:39,480
um you know that you see in social media

1340
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:41,338
or

1341
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:43,380
or on the Internet or even from like

1342
00:54:41,338 --> 00:54:45,599
reputable teachers

1343
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:48,440
um you know just just never stop asking

1344
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:50,818
questions and I think the most reputable

1345
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:53,960
folks to work with are people who will

1346
00:54:50,818 --> 00:54:53,960
encourage your questions

1347
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:58,139
yeah I think I think you said it well

1348
00:54:56,699 --> 00:54:59,639
it's a tough topic because you don't

1349
00:54:58,139 --> 00:55:00,539
want to be the bad guy

1350
00:54:59,639 --> 00:55:04,019
um

1351
00:55:00,539 --> 00:55:06,599
either at least not publicly

1352
00:55:04,019 --> 00:55:08,039
um yeah and I think also looking is is

1353
00:55:06,599 --> 00:55:09,780
the education that you're getting from

1354
00:55:08,039 --> 00:55:11,639
this company is it product based or is

1355
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:14,099
it educational that gives you the tools

1356
00:55:11,639 --> 00:55:16,139
to actually improve your growing process

1357
00:55:14,099 --> 00:55:17,579
without those products and and that's

1358
00:55:16,139 --> 00:55:19,799
something people I think can take a

1359
00:55:17,579 --> 00:55:23,099
little closer look at too

1360
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:25,019
um I just did a podcast with uh Michael

1361
00:55:23,099 --> 00:55:26,940
brownbridge from bioworks he's a

1362
00:55:25,019 --> 00:55:29,338
pathologist over there and they were

1363
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:32,400
looking at Bavaria from various

1364
00:55:29,338 --> 00:55:33,960
companies uh and some of these companies

1365
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:35,940
like one in particular in the living

1366
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:38,519
solo game is selling Bavaria where the

1367
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:40,980
Spore count is so low that it would be

1368
00:55:38,519 --> 00:55:42,719
impossible to get any efficacy but yet

1369
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:44,579
you know if you were to go online and

1370
00:55:42,719 --> 00:55:46,618
look at the reviews of the product and

1371
00:55:44,579 --> 00:55:49,260
and such you would think that it was

1372
00:55:46,619 --> 00:55:50,940
highly effective so you're right there's

1373
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:53,099
a big difference between marketing and

1374
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:56,338
sales and and what's

1375
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:58,619
actually works or what's actually best

1376
00:55:56,338 --> 00:55:59,880
practice and I think as an industry you

1377
00:55:58,619 --> 00:56:02,160
know I'd like to say we're going to get

1378
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:04,079
there but that's kind of dominated the

1379
00:56:02,159 --> 00:56:07,019
cannabis industry since the advanced

1380
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:10,140
nutrients days way back uh you know 20

1381
00:56:07,019 --> 00:56:12,780
20 30 years ago now so

1382
00:56:10,139 --> 00:56:15,480
um I think it'll always be there and I

1383
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:17,700
think folks just need to be really like

1384
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:19,740
you said Discerning and and think about

1385
00:56:17,699 --> 00:56:21,838
what they're hearing and question things

1386
00:56:19,739 --> 00:56:25,139
from everyone

1387
00:56:21,838 --> 00:56:28,259
yeah and you know and again like the the

1388
00:56:25,139 --> 00:56:30,179
more simple approach with really simple

1389
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:32,819
inputs like

1390
00:56:30,179 --> 00:56:35,159
it's been successful for Growers for a

1391
00:56:32,818 --> 00:56:38,579
really really long time and I have never

1392
00:56:35,159 --> 00:56:41,940
found like one particular commercial

1393
00:56:38,579 --> 00:56:46,200
product like formulated product that was

1394
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:48,720
like a silver bullet you know I've I've

1395
00:56:46,199 --> 00:56:51,480
never you know whether it's like a

1396
00:56:48,719 --> 00:56:53,459
microbial inoculant whether it's a

1397
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:58,260
pesticide or a fungicide or I don't care

1398
00:56:53,460 --> 00:57:01,199
what it is like I I really haven't found

1399
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:02,520
um anything that is as magical as

1400
00:57:01,199 --> 00:57:05,219
marketing

1401
00:57:02,519 --> 00:57:07,920
would have us believe or that works in

1402
00:57:05,219 --> 00:57:10,439
every single instance so you know I

1403
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:14,099
think I think the more you can focus on

1404
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:16,440
those core Sops those core really simple

1405
00:57:14,099 --> 00:57:17,880
inputs you can build a system that's

1406
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:19,559
really strong and then you can play with

1407
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:20,940
the products you know you don't have to

1408
00:57:19,559 --> 00:57:23,160
rely on them and you don't have to spend

1409
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:26,900
a million dollars on them you know you

1410
00:57:23,159 --> 00:57:26,899
can just see where whether they work

1411
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:32,940
yeah and speaking of what works like I

1412
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:34,318
get emails from people or photos and and

1413
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:36,480
they're they're crushing it right

1414
00:57:34,318 --> 00:57:39,119
they're real happy with their program

1415
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:40,920
um their Sops may not be the same as

1416
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:42,720
mine like they may be doing things that

1417
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:44,818
I don't necessarily choose to do like I

1418
00:57:42,719 --> 00:57:46,379
don't choose to cover crop indoors and I

1419
00:57:44,818 --> 00:57:47,639
have my reasons why but that's not to

1420
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:50,039
say there aren't people out there doing

1421
00:57:47,639 --> 00:57:51,539
it successfully

1422
00:57:50,039 --> 00:57:53,400
um and so at the end of the day if your

1423
00:57:51,539 --> 00:57:55,039
sop is working for you and you're happy

1424
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:57,960
with what you're spending on your crop

1425
00:57:55,039 --> 00:57:59,699
who am I to tell you otherwise I have a

1426
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:02,460
guy that sent me photos of his

1427
00:57:59,699 --> 00:58:04,318
greenhouse and he encourages weeds and

1428
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:06,838
he loves it and his plants look great

1429
00:58:04,318 --> 00:58:09,179
and you know for him that's an ecosystem

1430
00:58:06,838 --> 00:58:11,338
that's working really well

1431
00:58:09,179 --> 00:58:13,318
um is sort of in communion and

1432
00:58:11,338 --> 00:58:15,239
I was like great you know that's working

1433
00:58:13,318 --> 00:58:17,159
for you here's the reasons where I think

1434
00:58:15,239 --> 00:58:19,679
you could get into trouble but at the

1435
00:58:17,159 --> 00:58:22,019
end of the day it's just an opinion and

1436
00:58:19,679 --> 00:58:23,519
if you're growing happy healthy plants

1437
00:58:22,019 --> 00:58:25,559
that's that's what we're all going for

1438
00:58:23,519 --> 00:58:27,179
in the end so

1439
00:58:25,559 --> 00:58:28,559
um yeah I don't I don't want people to

1440
00:58:27,179 --> 00:58:30,598
get too caught up in like you said that

1441
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:32,160
there's this perfect sop for everyone or

1442
00:58:30,599 --> 00:58:34,440
the one person's right that person's

1443
00:58:32,159 --> 00:58:38,639
wrong it's like I think you can look at

1444
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:39,720
ways to to grow more cost effectively

1445
00:58:38,639 --> 00:58:41,578
um and that's something you could

1446
00:58:39,719 --> 00:58:43,379
explore even if you're growing great

1447
00:58:41,579 --> 00:58:44,519
plants that maybe that's the next step

1448
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:47,880
but

1449
00:58:44,519 --> 00:58:50,699
but yeah you know do what you want

1450
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:53,099
yeah I mean and and that's what you know

1451
00:58:50,699 --> 00:58:54,960
that's where the the art of growing

1452
00:58:53,099 --> 00:58:56,519
comes into play

1453
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:59,639
um you know I don't think there should

1454
00:58:56,519 --> 00:59:03,358
be any just you know single right way

1455
00:58:59,639 --> 00:59:05,519
um and I think if you also are enjoying

1456
00:59:03,358 --> 00:59:07,318
what you're doing if you're having fun

1457
00:59:05,519 --> 00:59:09,358
with it and you're passionate about it

1458
00:59:07,318 --> 00:59:11,460
you're gonna always put in the extra

1459
00:59:09,358 --> 00:59:12,900
effort to to make your plants healthy

1460
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:17,838
and I think that that's like a secret

1461
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:17,838
ingredient that that can't be overlooked

1462
00:59:18,420 --> 00:59:24,059
yeah I I agree I really appreciate you

1463
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:25,440
taking the time today to share some of

1464
00:59:24,059 --> 00:59:28,400
your thoughts around this and maybe we

1465
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:30,720
can connect again on other other topics

1466
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:31,980
uh from a grower perspective which is

1467
00:59:30,719 --> 00:59:33,959
what I think you really bring to the

1468
00:59:31,980 --> 00:59:36,059
table and I I love that

1469
