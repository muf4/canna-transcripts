organics this is the podcast where we

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,320
discuss

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,480
the cutting edge of growing from a

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,079
science-based perspective and drawn top

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,679
experts from around the industry to

10
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:34,079
share their wisdom and knowledge

11
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:35,920
my guest this week is rob nectal founder

12
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,600
of black swallow living soils

13
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,760
although rob's lifelong interest in

14
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,679
growing cannabis began in the late 60s

15
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:43,759
he has spent the past 45 years in a

16
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:46,000
completely unrelated industry designing

17
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:47,679
installing and marketing fireplaces

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,200
when the canadian government announced

19
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:51,519
approximately five years ago that they

20
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,079
would be legalizing cannabis production

21
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,480
rob his wife lou and son nathan decided

22
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,320
to start up black swallow living soil

23
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:59,919
nathan runs the day-to-day operations

24
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,759
with his team and rob along with his

25
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,600
wife continue to concentrate on further

26
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:05,280
building the black swallow brand

27
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,719
after meeting on a visit to goldleaf

28
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,640
gardens a few years ago

29
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:10,158
rob and nathan began to work on a couple

30
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,400
projects with kiss organics

31
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,760
and now blend the kiss mix based off of

32
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,000
my formulation

33
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,600
in a relatively short time black swallow

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,759
living soil has gained significant

35
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:21,280
recognition as a respected supplier of

36
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,560
organic soil amendments and growing

37
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,799
supplies in canada

38
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,000
which they ship coast to coast in this

39
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,600
podcast we discuss

40
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,118
exactly what goes into formulating a

41
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:31,039
soil mix as well as some of the

42
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:32,000
challenges we see on a daily basis in

43
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,960
this industry

44
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,959
now on to the show

45
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,719
hey rob thanks for coming on the show

46
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:42,478
today

47
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:45,039
great ted excited to be here yeah so you

48
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:46,000
are uh the owner of black swallow living

49
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,280
soils

50
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,200
up in canada can you talk to

51
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,640
listeners a little bit about yourself a

52
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,880
little bit about the history

53
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,159
of the company where you're located in

54
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:59,679
canada

55
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:04,320
some of those questions sure

56
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:07,600
um so located first in southern ontario

57
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:08,878
in brantford which is a

58
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:10,799
number of your listeners will know is

59
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:14,639
the home of wayne gretzky

60
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:19,599
um but also part of a of a

61
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:21,919
pretty serious agricultural area um

62
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:23,359
and black swallow came out of

63
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:26,000
conversations between

64
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,599
myself and my son nathan who runs the

65
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,800
business with me

66
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:33,359
and this is prior to

67
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,200
trudeau's announcement that canada was

68
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,480
going to be

69
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:44,399
embracing legalization and

70
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:44,399
we saw the opportunity to

71
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:48,560
get an amendment input supply company up

72
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,598
and running

73
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,199
and started to put the

74
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:55,119
program together at that point in time

75
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:58,799
and of course the first

76
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:02,400
bit was pretty lean but since that time

77
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,400
the business has grown considerably

78
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:07,598
so you started in 2015 you've had

79
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,560
uh you had some other experiences in

80
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:12,878
running businesses in other markets

81
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,400
um do you want to touch on on that a

82
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:17,598
little bit

83
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:21,039
yeah black swallow is really

84
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:23,919
our second business if you will

85
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:25,679
we have over 40 years experience in a

86
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:28,958
completely unrelated

87
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:32,159
industry um fireplace industry where we

88
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,759
we do some oem uh

89
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:35,359
manufacturing for some of the fireplace

90
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:38,639
manufacturers and whatnot

91
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,239
that also gave us um uh pretty good

92
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:41,119
experience in terms of moving products

93
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,439
around uh

94
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,640
well globally as well as north america

95
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:46,959
so that uh

96
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:49,439
that helped out when we wanted to get uh

97
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,360
black swallow up and running because

98
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:53,199
probably the single biggest challenge

99
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,560
that we faced initially was just trying

100
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:59,359
to find

101
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:00,560
the canadian sources for uh our products

102
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,640
pulling products out of the united

103
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,318
states just alone because of the

104
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:05,759
canadian dollar difference but also

105
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:08,238
because the border and

106
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:09,840
shipping and all this sort of thing is

107
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:13,438
is not ideal

108
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,280
we had to find canadian sourced products

109
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:18,000
and that took a tremendous amount of

110
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:21,759
time and energy in the initial

111
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,959
early stages but um our ability to move

112
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,520
products and know how to

113
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:27,439
how to do that uh certainly played to

114
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:30,639
our advantage in those days

115
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:32,160
and as well as on moving forward in

116
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,918
business

117
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,919
yeah i think that logistics thing is is

118
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:38,639
huge because it's something that

119
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:40,159
we still struggle with it's the biggest

120
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,680
headache that we have is dealing with

121
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,880
logistics especially right now with

122
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,639
kovic going on

123
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:46,000
but your ability to move things across

124
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,680
borders i think

125
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,759
is is a huge advantage for you guys in

126
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,840
your business one thing i want to touch

127
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,639
on is you offer a lot of the same

128
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:56,638
or similar types of organic amendments

129
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,360
as as what we carry here in the united

130
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,040
states

131
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,800
with kiss organics you're shipping them

132
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,520

133
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,879
you guys are also the distributors and

134

138
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:12,800

00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:21,600
and you also make soils which is one of

143
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:24,079
the reasons i wanted to have you on the

144
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:28,160
podcast today was to talk about soil

145
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:30,079
so uh you and i started working together

146
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,600
uh you know three or four years ago now

147
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:33,359
i met you when you guys came down you

148
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,479
toured gold leaf i had went to a few

149
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,639
other facilities

150
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:37,680
uh we got to have lunch it was it was a

151
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,120

uh to get to meet you guys in person uh

153
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,240
you take me through a little bit of your

154
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,120
soil

155
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,478
formulation process because uh you know

156
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,399
the main point of this podcast will be

157
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:52,240
to talk about soil formulation and then

158
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:52,638
the process you and i went to but let's

159
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,160
start

160
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,360
let's go a little bit before that

161
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,880
because i know you were making other

162
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,319
soils as well

163
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:01,918
uh can we start there yeah i mean that

164
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,400
uh that too was a

165
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:06,399
bloody nose experience you inevitably

166
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:07,679
run up against the wall a few times in

167
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:12,039
in terms of trying to

168
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,199
develop the the best recipe that you can

169
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:16,800
[Music]

170
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:21,038
so i mean

171
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:24,000
i had had decades of experience sort of

172
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:27,038
my own personal uh growing experience

173
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,038
thought that i understood

174
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,199
soils and plant needs and soil science

175
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:34,638
and very quickly realized that

176
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:38,080
what i knew was was miles away from

177
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:40,639
what current soil soil science uh

178
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:42,159
where it is today spent an awful lot of

179
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,759
time

180
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,600
reading and studying and taking courses

181
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:49,120
and whatnot

182
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:51,840
and started off with a formula that

183
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,840
would be or as frequently referred to as

184
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:57,679
a clackamas coot i mean

185
00:06:53,839 --> 00:07:00,560
clack came out with a a recipe that

186
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,800
had a lot of mileage and tried

187
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,399
variations on that theme and

188
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,840
and went through the process of doing

189
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:08,478
the soil analysis

190
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:08,959
from batch to batch and trying to gently

191
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:11,918
tweak

192
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:14,079
the uh recipe forward thought that we

193
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:16,879
had a reasonable product

194
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:17,439
did have a reasonable product but then

195
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:20,959
after

196
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:24,319
uh meeting yourself and being able to

197
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:25,198
talk to someone who who had considerably

198
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:29,759
greater

199
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:31,680
depth of experience with blending soils

200
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,800
learned quite a bit and you were quite

201
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,079
instrumental in

202
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:38,960
working with us to develop our version

203
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:40,000
of what we have called in recognition of

204
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:43,519
your input the

205
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,399
the kiss mix now when i say our version

206
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:46,240
that means

207
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:47,918
that we're i'm taking into consideration

208
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,319
the fact that our you know we have

209
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:51,839
considerable different geographical um

210
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:55,360
availability of products

211
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:58,478
um and uh it makes no sense trying to

212
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,919
to duplicate when uh certain products

213
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,439
that you would use in your mix are not

214
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:03,680
necessarily available here in southern

215
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:06,639
ontario and vice versa

216
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:10,000
so for instance rock dusts because of

217
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:12,000
the proximity to the canadian shield

218
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,918
we have some pretty interesting rock

219
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,038
dust in in ontario that

220
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:21,198
uh we had ready access to

221
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:22,959
whereas things like pumice which is

222
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,400
apparently quite readily available in

223
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:26,719
your backyard

224
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:28,000
um you know we we we have to bring that

225
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,840
in by the truckload either from the

226
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,120
states or from bc

227
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:36,559
so as a as a narration contribution um

228
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,320
it's it's what i refer to as sort of a

229
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:40,799
a luxury amendment because of the

230
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,879
shipping costs and whatnot and

231
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,559
it's just not practical to use something

232
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:46,399
like that and a standard mix

233
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:48,079
so we had to we had to work with pricing

234
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:51,759
and availability and

235
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,560
and um do the vetting of of the various

236
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:55,360
different uh

237
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:57,119
inputs that we have to ensure that uh we

238
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,480
got the best bang for the buck and uh

239
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,519
the current kiss mix is

240
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:04,959
is has been on the market now for

241
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:06,240
four years or so three to four years and

242
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:08,559
has

243
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,759
proven to be very successful for us it's

244
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:11,679
uh it's

245
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:13,838
it's been very quite a pleasure to work

246
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:15,679
with

247
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,959
yeah so so just going back i do want to

248
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:18,639
touch on uh

249
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:20,079
the coots mix i know a lot of people

250
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:21,278
have had really good success with it

251
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,480
there's certainly nothing

252
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:25,439
uh wrong with that recipe one thing i

253
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,600
would like to highlight

254
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,959
in regards to that is that ku kut

255
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,040
himself has always said you're not

256
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:33,039
growing in kutz mix if you're not using

257
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:34,559
his earthworm castings

258
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:36,639
which obviously are not available

259
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:38,719
commercially and that makes a big

260
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:41,919
difference too in terms of the overall

261
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,120
quality and finished product so

262
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:45,919
i just want to throw that out there for

263
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:48,399
folks and then also

264
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:49,919
that yeah we started talking about

265
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,799
formulation i know you were working with

266
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:53,199
another

267
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:54,879
agronomist there and had a mix but you

268
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,560
weren't completely

269
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:59,278
satisfied with it and then you and i

270
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:00,479
talked about collaborating on something

271
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:02,720
and this was you know three or four

272
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,079
years ago now and

273
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,000
i kind of wanted to talk about that

274
00:10:04,078 --> 00:10:08,000
process for people uh because there's a

275
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,159
lot of people that make their own soils

276
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,679
and i think understanding what we went

277
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:17,519
through to formulate this soil together

278
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:19,838
i think might be a useful exercise so

279
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:22,440
the first thing you mentioned was uh

280
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:25,360
sourcing products so looking at the

281
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:27,920
sustainability and availability

282
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,680
of these products which i think is is

283
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:32,799
really really important so

284
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:34,479
you know things like um

285
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:36,639
you know things like pumice that aren't

286
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,440
as locally available we had to say okay

287
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:39,600
well

288
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,680
what other products could we use in this

289
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,159
case uh we may want to use pumice but

290
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:44,078
it's not

291
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:45,199
it's not sustainable the cost of freight

292
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:48,479
is too high it's going to

293
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,600
raise the cost of the soil more than the

294
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,159
value

295
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,278
that the pumice was providing do you

296
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:54,639
want to kind of talk through some of the

297
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:55,919
inputs in that regard

298
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:57,679
you know you introduced me to some new

299
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:59,599
rock dust i never heard of that i had to

300
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:02,319
research

301
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,440
yeah what are your thoughts around that

302
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,320
yeah i mean that was

303
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,040
that was that was a a steep ladder to

304
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,160
climb

305
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:12,159
um we didn't

306
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:15,039
we didn't want to just buy from you know

307
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:16,958
where products were available through

308
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:19,439
some distributors we didn't want to just

309
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:20,879
buy from distributors i mean

310
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,800
to make black swallow work we knew that

311
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:24,159
we had to buy from the sources

312
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:25,919
the producers of these various

313
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:27,039
amendments wherever and whenever

314
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:29,278
possible

315
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:30,639
and that involved a fair amount of

316
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:32,159
vetting of

317
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:34,240
various different suppliers and i

318
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:35,679
actually traveled to a couple different

319
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,360
provinces on a number of different

320
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:40,159
occasions to

321
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,039
visit different facilities to see what

322
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:44,319
they had to offer

323
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:45,120
to be able to weigh one producer against

324
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,480
another

325
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,519
um it also meant uh taking samples of

326
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,440
these products and

327
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,278
and and having them lab tested and

328
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,399
whatnot in some cases to

329
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:57,200
test for heavy metals and and that sort

330
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,799
of thing

331
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:03,759
um i think one of the other

332
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:04,399
big challenges that that we were up

333
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:06,559
against

334
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,440
was um i know when we were out there on

335
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:10,799
the west coast

336
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:14,680
uh i was gobsmacked at the

337
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:18,078
difference in cultural awareness between

338
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:21,278
organic benefits

339
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:23,039
for lack of a better term

340
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:25,039
i remember going into a grocery store

341
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:26,319
i'm not too far from you

342
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:28,559

343
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,360
and where here in ontario you would have

344
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:30,559
a

345
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,839
you know regular grocery store you'd

346
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:32,879
have a small corner of the grocery store

347
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,440
that would be selling

348
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:36,879
organic food and whatnot it seemed to be

349
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,079
just the complete reverse that the

350
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:40,240
entire grocery store

351
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:41,599
was was filled with organic products

352
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,278
that was the norm and

353
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,079
it seemed as if there was a tiny corner

354
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:46,559
where regular non-organic foods were

355
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:48,159
sold

356
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:50,239
i know i'm exaggerating to some extent

357
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:53,759
but it just seemed to

358
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:57,278
be that obvious so i mean

359
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:57,759
even trying to find a quality supplier

360
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:00,159
of

361
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:01,360
uh you mentioned worm castings that uh

362
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:03,679
the clack produces and

363
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,039
he certainly is a master of worm casting

364
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:07,359
production

365
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:08,639
very very difficult in ontario there

366
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:12,079
really is only

367
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,560
um one uh casting supplier that can

368
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:15,278
produce

369
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:17,599
any sort of volume it's really done as a

370
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:19,360
byproduct or it had been done until

371
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,839
only very recently as a byproduct of

372
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:24,399
their bait worm industry

373
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,120
um they have since turned that around

374
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,360
and are

375
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,600
are committed now to uh to quality

376
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,200
casting uh production and are doing a

377
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,200
good job of it but

378
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,320
um there's only really one game in the

379
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,440
province

380
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,959
compost i i visited numerous different

381
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,399
farms and talked to numerous different

382
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:43,359
suppliers of compost

383
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:45,278
in an effort to track down as as high a

384
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:49,839
quality of compost as i knew

385
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:49,838
we wanted to have and should have

386
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:54,958
talking to suppliers of kelp products

387
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:57,360
talking to

388
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:58,399
some of the fish factories about their

389
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,360
their crab meal

390
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,078
supplies and whatnot it took a lot of

391
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,240
vetting and

392
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:05,599
a lot of research to get to the point

393
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,759
where we are

394
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:11,440
um and i'm kind of glad those days are

395
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:13,600
over

396
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,959
oh man i hear you i remember starting

397
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,920
kiss with the idea

398
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:19,838
because of well two things one i i

399
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:21,439
wanted to be able to make soil at home

400
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,720
and i wanted i didn't need a 50 pound

401
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,519
bag of

402
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,240
kelp meal or neem cake or whatever

403
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,399
particular

404
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,919
input it was i wanted like three pounds

405
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,120
because i was only growing a few plants

406
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:33,278
at the time

407
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,639
and and i saw this sort of like need in

408
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:35,919
the industry

409
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:37,680
at that point in time and now there's

410
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:38,559
multiple companies doing what we're

411
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:39,919
doing

412
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:41,838
and you're kind of doing that now up in

413
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:43,439
canada there aren't a lot of

414
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,680
amendment suppliers at the moment but

415
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,880
i'm sure there's more on their way

416
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:48,479
but it's a lot of work to get to

417
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:49,919
something like this up and running and

418
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,039
your logistics background

419
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:55,120
i think helped a lot you did touch

420
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:57,120
on a couple things that i wanted to talk

421
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,278
a little bit more in depth on

422
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,879
one of which was the sourcing of the

423
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:02,639
compost and

424
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:04,078
when it comes to formulating soils i

425
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,079
really think at least with

426
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:07,439
you know potting soils living soils

427
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:09,359
that's where you need to start

428
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,720
is with your compost or your worm

429
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,159
castings

430
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,759
because you're really formulating around

431
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:14,799
that that's the that's the product

432
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:16,559
that's going to determine

433
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:18,559
how much of these other inputs you're

434
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:20,719
going to put into the soil

435
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:22,799
so the highest quality source you can

436
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,160
get and afford i i recommend that to

437
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:26,399
people

438
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:28,399
as their starting point and you also

439
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,078
touched on heavy metals

440
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,320
one of the things that i asked you for

441
00:15:30,078 --> 00:15:33,919
was the heavy metal analysis of

442
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,480
all these products especially the

443
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:39,278
compost and the rock dusts

444
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,480
as anything mined as a potential source

445
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:41,838
of

446
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,519
heavy metals because you guys do heavy

447
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,120
metal testing up in canada just like we

448
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:48,879
do in most states

449
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:51,679
so yes yes yep no i mean

450
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:52,958
those are all those are all very very

451
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:57,278
real

452
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:58,958
concerns um again i know for a fact that

453
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:02,399
that heavy metal

454
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:05,119
uh awareness in your marketplace is is

455
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,919
is much more common than it is here um

456
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,839
in

457
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:09,360
large parts of canada but it's

458
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:10,800
inevitable that it's coming and we want

459
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,919
to be able to answer the questions when

460
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:13,838
they're asked of us and

461
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:15,519
you know i have already done the

462
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:18,130
homework to ensure that

463
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:20,000
we have no concerns there um

464
00:16:18,129 --> 00:16:23,120
[Music]

465
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,240
products that uh with compost

466
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:28,078
as you well know there are unfortunately

467
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,039
a lot of people who look at compost as

468
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:32,399
simply a

469
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:34,958
broken down organic material

470
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,078
others look at it strictly from its

471
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:39,119
ability to

472
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:39,599
to supplement the fertility needs of of

473
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,679
of the

474
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,278
of the crop and they they look at it

475
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:46,638
strictly from a

476
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:49,278
nutritional analysis point of view

477
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,320
but with the game that we're playing

478
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:53,039
here the it's

479
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,519
it's the biology contribution um as well

480
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:56,639
that is

481
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,919
if if not even more critical uh that

482
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,399
needs to be in place

483
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:01,120
and um that's a lot of boxes to have to

484
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,480
check off

485
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:06,480
when when when the industry is

486
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,160
is really only emerging we're still in

487
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,120
the in the very early game

488
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:13,038
here and uh we're working with a couple

489
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:14,000
of uh compost producers for instance

490
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:15,599
that uh

491
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,119
recognize this and and are working

492
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:19,438
really hard to get their uh their

493
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:22,000
product up and running

494
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,519
and have done a great job of moving

495
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,558
their game forward

496
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:29,918
um but it's a lot of

497
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:32,240
a lot of conversations along the way

498
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:33,919
yeah and in terms of you know actionable

499
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,000
information for users

500
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:38,720
uh when i started working with rob on

501
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,038
this you know having already formulated

502
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,000
the

503
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:43,119
the mix that we use here in the united

504
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,200
states

505
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:46,399
which took me oh probably five or six

506
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,038
years to really

507
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,559
nail down this process with rob took you

508
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:52,319
know two to three years

509
00:17:50,558 --> 00:17:53,839
i think we could have done it faster but

510
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:54,720
you know both running businesses and

511
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:57,359
everything else that

512
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,720
that takes time but there is a period of

513
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:00,639
time that goes into

514
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,839
researching and and going through this

515
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,160
and so

516
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:05,119
uh starting off with the base mix we

517
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,480
were looking at

518
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:11,279
peat moss per light only because of its

519
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,880
ability to source and cost versus other

520
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:15,119
aeration amendments

521
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,160
and then in this case three types of

522
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:18,719
compost you had

523
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,400
access to a nice fish compost a leaf

524
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,919
compost which i really like we don't

525
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,840
i don't have a good source of that here

526
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:26,320
in washington state

527
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:27,359
and then some worm castings so between

528
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:29,038
the peat

529
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:30,399
and the three compost sources that's

530
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:33,119
really where we're getting the

531
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,240
the biological aspect of our soil

532
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:35,678
because when i'm

533
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,960
when i'm thinking of formulating soils

534
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,600
i'm looking at three things i'm looking

535
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,720
at the

536
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:42,000
uh physical properties of the soil and

537
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,079
that's going to be how well does

538
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,919
it drain how well what's its cec how

539
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:49,599
well does it hold nutrients

540
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:53,280
what's its water saturation capacity

541
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:55,439
those sorts of aspects of of a of a mix

542
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:57,200
and then i want to think about the

543
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,400
biological aspects you know what kind of

544
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,440
microbiology we're going to have here

545
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,038
because that's what's going to cycle the

546
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,120
nutrients and that's where having a few

547
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:05,119
different diverse sources

548
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:06,719
is is going to help and then also

549
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:08,159
sources that are you know high in

550
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,679
microbiology because i think i had you

551
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,360
send me samples and i looked down at the

552
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:13,120
microscope i can't remember and then

553
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:14,639
you also had some that had some lab

554
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:18,000
testing so i was able to at least see

555
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:19,600
some numbers on on that side of things

556
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,599
and then ultimately the last sort of

557
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:24,639
pillar sort of the chemical properties

558
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:26,240
or the mineral content of there of these

559
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,679
different things so once i had all of

560
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,440
that then we could start thinking about

561
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,000
what other things we wanted to add into

562
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,840
the

563
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,440
into the soil mix yeah i mean

564
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:37,519
yeah you're absolutely right that that

565
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:40,240
structure is is probably

566
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:40,879
it probably is deservedly you know the

567
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,519
number one

568
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,559
position in in terms of that list of of

569
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:47,119
qualities you want to

570
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:48,240
you want to develop and and that

571
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:50,079
original

572
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,960
our original mixes that we started out

573
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:54,240
with um for aeration uh we were using

574
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,200
rice halls

575
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,319
and um thought that was a a pretty

576
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,038
reasonable

577
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:02,158
um aeration option for us and had the

578
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:04,319
benefits of the the

579
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:06,080
you know broken down into silica content

580
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:09,678
and whatnot

581
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:13,119
but we learned we learned after some

582
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:16,240
struggles that that rice halls

583
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:19,759
although not bad that it not

584
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,000
perfectly mixed into that mix it in then

585
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:22,319
you

586
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,720
it would tend to direct water into

587
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:26,720
certain channels within the soil itself

588
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:29,120
and it would leave some dry pockets and

589
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:32,000
and and that created some issues

590
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:32,558
so um it really was that trial and error

591
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,079
process

592
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:37,918
of having to look at

593
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:39,678
whatever we were attempting to do with

594
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:42,240
this object objective

595
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,880
lens as possible and in the end decided

596
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,720
that

597
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,240
perlite really was going to be the

598
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:49,440
superior aeration

599
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:52,640
uh offering uh given you know

600
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,600
the range of options before us um same

601
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,400
with the

602
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:57,038
uh compost uh we we've since that time

603
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,280
where

604
00:20:57,038 --> 00:21:01,119
we've now got an addition of a horse

605
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:04,319
compost to our mix that

606
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:06,399
i love the guy that

607
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:07,918
makes that compost that we discovered

608
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,360
not too long ago

609
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:13,440
just absolutely lives breathes and eats

610
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:14,558
compost making he was studying under

611
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,759
elaine ingham

612
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:21,599
12 14 years ago

613
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:23,200
and has has he makes a tremendous

614
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:24,719
product with all the inputs from his own

615
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,679
farm and whatnot

616
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:30,079
so it uh it really is a trial and error

617
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,759
process at that level

618
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:33,759
yeah i know a lot of people will go a

619
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:34,400
third a third a third so like a third

620
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:38,240
pete

621
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:41,600
a third compost and a third

622
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,079
aeration i tend to lean towards closer

623
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:45,119
to

624
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:48,240
20 on the compost and

625
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:50,000
i i still go about 33 34 of some sort of

626
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:53,038
aeration amendment

627
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,839
and then the rest of that is typically

628
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:58,400
peat moss in the mixes that i like and i

629
00:21:55,839 --> 00:22:01,119
like that mix for its ability to

630
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,679
retain water and and have good aeration

631
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:02,879
but

632
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,400
you know a lot of people i know

633
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,159
successfully grow with that third third

634
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,240
third ratio so

635
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,280
that's sort of your starting base mix

636
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,319
part and then

637
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:14,960
on top of that we start adding

638
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:15,599
you know these other amendments and i

639
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,319
remember

640
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:20,240
the first time i sent you a recipe you

641
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:21,038
were shocked because it was so much more

642
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,960
than

643
00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:24,640
anyone else had recommended putting into

644
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,840
a soil mix

645
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,559
can you talk about a little your

646
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:28,558
experience there

647
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:33,440
yeah it definitely was more than uh than

648
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,080
our recipes that we were using at the

649
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,240
time

650
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:42,558
um but uh we certainly gave it a try

651
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:45,359
and uh the proof was was there

652
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:48,480
so i think today our mix has 19

653
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:48,479
different amendments into it

654
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:54,000
it's uh we do go i think a little

655
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:56,000
heavier on the rock

656
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,839
dust contribution than you do again

657
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,359
because it is something that we have

658
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:01,678
ready access to

659
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:03,839
and the prices are reasonable and uh you

660
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:08,240
know so why not

661
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:12,639
um but the complexity of the product

662
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:16,079
i think just enhances its performance

663
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:18,480
the structure of the product is lovely i

664
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:21,599
mean we

665
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,038
most people who are who are jumping into

666
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:25,519
growing in soil for the first time

667
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:28,000
struggle a bit with being able to

668
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:29,839
to get their soil to the proper moisture

669
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,079
level

670
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:34,240
we add yucca to assist in that as a

671
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:36,639
surfactant

672
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,000
but it does take a little bit of work to

673
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,640
get the moisture levels

674
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,679
rehydrate the soil to to the ideal level

675
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,400
that

676
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:45,200
the grower wants to use but that is

677
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,440
simply uh

678
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,519
that just takes patience um you know

679
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,480
smaller doses of watering

680
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:54,558
with a bit of time in between to allow

681
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,960
it to get absorbed and then the next

682
00:23:54,558 --> 00:24:00,480
watering uh is is much more efficient in

683
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,480
terms of penetrating that material

684
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:04,399
but once you've gotten that

685
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,400
understanding of of

686
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,798
of how to maintain the moisture levels

687
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:11,679
that you feel your plants require

688
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:13,119
then it becomes a pretty uh painless

689
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,919
process especially if you're using

690
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:19,359
something like blue mats to help in that

691
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:20,480
that irrigation process

692
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:23,359
yeah you brought up a good point

693
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,960
regarding uh moisture content so

694
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:27,599
optimally with these soils we want to

695
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,519
keep the moisture fairly even in there

696
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:31,599
we want to avoid these wet dry cycles

697
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:35,278
and and peat moss is naturally

698
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:36,319
very hydrophobic so when you mix the

699
00:24:35,278 --> 00:24:37,599
soils

700
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:40,399
there on the facility can you talk a

701
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:41,759
little bit about that process in terms

702
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,240
of the

703
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:45,038
the watering component and sort of that

704
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,200
heating and

705
00:24:45,038 --> 00:24:48,558
cooling that almost thermal composting

706
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,038
process from all the nutrients that

707
00:24:48,558 --> 00:24:51,038
we're adding

708
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:57,120
um well i mean again that was that too

709
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:01,600
was its own steep learning curve

710
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:03,519
um we started off uh doing uh

711
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:05,918
about the soil mixer and started learn

712
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:08,639
how to add the materials to that soil

713
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:10,240
mixer itself which was very limiting in

714
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,278
terms of the quantities of materials

715
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,640
that we could uh

716
00:25:11,278 --> 00:25:17,679
produce at any particular time but

717
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:19,278
even handling the when you poured in

718
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:20,798
some of the dry ingredients and then

719
00:25:19,278 --> 00:25:22,480
when you added the compost and when you

720
00:25:20,798 --> 00:25:25,599
added everything else was

721
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:27,679
was was a problematic we

722
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:29,759
shut the machine down so many times and

723
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:33,120
had to take the material out because it

724
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:36,000
it balled up on us or or just

725
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:37,278
just slogged down the machine we've

726
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,038
since moved on from

727
00:25:37,278 --> 00:25:43,440
from a soil mixing system to our current

728
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:44,480
uh method of of blending the soils

729
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,679
together and that's

730
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:49,839
also allowed us to do a much larger

731
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:52,000
quantity at a single time

732
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:54,319
which has helped kept up with the demand

733
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,119
um i think that

734
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:59,759
here in ontario although we're on a

735
00:25:57,119 --> 00:26:01,678
similar sort of

736
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:02,879
level with yourselves latitudinally i

737
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:05,038
guess that is

738
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,000
um but i think our winters are a little

739
00:26:05,038 --> 00:26:08,240
more intense

740
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,919
and we have a big problem with with this

741
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,200
time of year in the freeze so we have to

742
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:13,520
make

743
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,120
as much soil as we possibly can in the

744
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:15,918
fall to guide us through the winter

745
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:18,079
because

746
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:20,960
everything freezes on us we don't have

747
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:24,240
enough indoor space to be able to

748
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:26,880
store vast quantities of soil

749
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,919
so all we make up all our soils we leave

750
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,559
it outside

751
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,360
leave it exposed to the elements tote it

752
00:26:30,558 --> 00:26:34,639
up

753
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:36,879
and find that we have to bring those

754
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,440
frozen totes in and thaw them out before

755
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,039
we can

756
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,200
start packaging up that material or

757
00:26:39,038 --> 00:26:43,440
shipping it out

758
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,640
so it was a bit of a juggle trying to

759
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,840
learn how to

760
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,480
manage the soil production as it was

761
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:52,480
increasing

762
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:54,798
relative to the time of year um

763
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,319
we managed to squeak by last year i

764
00:26:54,798 --> 00:26:58,960
think that we'll make it through this

765
00:26:56,319 --> 00:27:00,158
this winter here it hits spring uh

766
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:04,079
running

767
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:05,520
and uh we know that uh as soon as it

768
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:06,639
gets mild enough in the product side

769
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:09,599
that we'll be right back out there

770
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,600
mixing soil again

771
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:12,798
yeah one thing i want to highlight for

772
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:16,159
people making soils

773
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:18,558
themselves is that if you do add

774
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:21,520
a large amount of nutrients when mixing

775
00:27:18,558 --> 00:27:23,839
the soil or these these amendments that

776
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:25,278
the microbes in your soil are going to

777
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:27,439
start breaking them down

778
00:27:25,278 --> 00:27:29,038
the bacteria and archaea are going to

779
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:32,159
reproduce quite rapidly

780
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:35,038
causing the the soil to heat up

781
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:36,559
it's an exothermic reaction so uh you

782
00:27:35,038 --> 00:27:38,640
don't want to plant into it right away

783
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:39,759
they actually uh you want the nutrients

784
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,600
to begin cycling

785
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:42,798
and so you'll you'll go through this

786
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:44,639
period where

787
00:27:42,798 --> 00:27:46,639
you mix everything and two three days

788
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,159
later the soil starts to heat up you

789
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:51,278
want to keep that moisture content

790
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:55,840
ideal lots of access to oxygen

791
00:27:51,278 --> 00:27:57,519
if it gets above 131 degrees you'll kill

792
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:59,199
off any weed seeds that you had in the

793
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:01,359
mix oh this is this is fahrenheit i

794
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,038
realize i'm talking to a canadian

795
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:05,839
i don't know the conversion for that but

796
00:28:03,038 --> 00:28:07,519
um if you get above 131 fahrenheit

797
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:09,519
it'll kill off all the pathogens and

798
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:11,679
weed seeds in your mix

799
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:12,798
keep it below 160 to keep all the

800
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:14,240
beneficials alive

801
00:28:12,798 --> 00:28:16,639
and treat it like you would almost a

802
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,319
compost pile so you would turn it

803
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,840
it would heat up again and then over the

804
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:22,480
period of the next

805
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:24,079
you know week or so given enough access

806
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,919
to oxygen the right moisture that soil

807
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:27,759
will sort of stabilize back at ambient

808
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:30,559
air temperature and at that point

809
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:32,319
you're ready to plant and some people

810
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:33,278
try and skip this step or i've had guys

811
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:36,079
put their soil

812
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:37,599
into uh you know rubber made totes with

813
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:40,398
no holes and then it turns into this

814
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:44,398
like stinky smelly mess

815
00:28:40,398 --> 00:28:45,839
oh yeah so just uh

816
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:47,599
this is referred to as the cooking

817
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:48,720
process i think is the common term that

818
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:50,959
uh people

819
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,240
like to use and and it is you're

820
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,519
absolutely right it is an absolutely

821
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,038
critical step

822
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:56,798
um it is relative i think to the

823
00:28:55,038 --> 00:28:58,640
quantities that you're making i mean for

824
00:28:56,798 --> 00:29:00,960
a guy who's got

825
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,919
four or five gallon pots and he's mixing

826
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:05,440
together uh

827
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:07,120
20 gallons of soil

828
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,960
he's not going to get those that

829
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:10,319
temperature spike in the the steaming

830
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,798
pile that

831
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:14,558
a guy was making a couple yards or um

832
00:29:12,798 --> 00:29:15,200
you know a driveway full of soil is

833
00:29:14,558 --> 00:29:18,398
going to

834
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:22,558
is going to achieve that's really good

835
00:29:18,398 --> 00:29:23,839
i mean yeah you do have to factor um

836
00:29:22,558 --> 00:29:26,480
especially if you're going to be

837
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:29,918
planting directly into this material

838
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:31,360
with your clones it starts you do not

839
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:33,278
want to make the mistake of

840
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:34,798
having too hot of soil because the

841
00:29:33,278 --> 00:29:35,759
plants just won't survive in that you

842
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:38,319
want

843
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:39,200
plus as you stated you've got the

844
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:42,480
advantage of

845
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:44,880
that biology that has already

846
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,399
changed much of the nutrition the

847
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,000
available nutrition that's in locked

848
00:29:46,398 --> 00:29:50,639
into that soil mix

849
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,839
into a more plant-available bioavailable

850
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,520
form

851
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:56,240
and i think that's you know i was

852
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:58,319
reading uh an article that uh john kemp

853
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:00,079
had uh written once and he pointed out

854
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:01,519
that i mean that's really what happens

855
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:03,359
in our spring when we when

856
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:04,720
when the weather gets warm again and

857
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:06,240
things start growing and you get that

858
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:09,278
incredible flush

859
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,720
of uh green growth that that that we're

860
00:30:09,278 --> 00:30:12,558
all familiar with

861
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,640
um a large part of that is directly

862
00:30:12,558 --> 00:30:16,879
attributable to the fact that

863
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,640
that over the the depth of that winter

864
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,559
the the winter months

865
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,919
the biology has kept on working it's

866
00:30:20,558 --> 00:30:24,639
been it's been

867
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:26,480
making the transformation of the soil

868
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,559
into that bioavailable form that

869
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,240
as soon as it gets warm again and then

870
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:32,079
the seeds begin to sprout

871
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,679
that the plant can take this tremendous

872
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:36,158
advantage of and has

873
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:37,679
a great nutritional resources for that

874
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:39,278
for that spring flush

875
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,559
so that's what's happening in your soil

876
00:30:39,278 --> 00:30:40,880
as you're mixing it up too you're trying

877
00:30:40,558 --> 00:30:43,918
to

878
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:45,919
duplicate that of course yeah i think

879
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:49,120
recognizing temperature as a factor is

880
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:50,960
important too if it's really cold out

881
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:52,879
things are going to go slower than if

882
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,079
it's really hot um

883
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,360
you know they're not going to reproduce

884
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:55,918
as quickly so that's something to

885
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:58,798
consider

886
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:59,440
and then also you know in that smaller

887
00:30:58,798 --> 00:31:01,679
pot

888
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,919
let's say like you mentioned that in

889
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:05,679
that first situation

890
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:07,200
while it may not heat up it's still

891
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:08,559
going to take a little while to nutrient

892
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,558
cycle and so even

893
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:11,599
even after mixing i still like to wait a

894
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:13,759
week or so

895
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:14,959
even in the smaller containers before

896
00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:18,158
planting

897
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:20,720
and frankly you know seedlings

898
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:21,519
rooted clones don't need this that much

899
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,120
nutrition

900
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:25,839
initially when they're first getting

901
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:27,359
started so i i think people sometimes

902
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:29,199
overdo it right at the beginning

903
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:30,558
and and slowed things down a little bit

904
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,960
in terms of plant growth you can

905
00:31:30,558 --> 00:31:34,398
definitely use a lighter mix

906
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:37,120
until the plants really got some

907
00:31:34,398 --> 00:31:38,639
established roots

908
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:40,239
yeah people ask us if we've got a good

909
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,679
seed start mix and um

910
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,159
of course we just tell them no just take

911
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:45,360
a little you know take 50 of the kiss

912
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:48,159
mix and 50

913
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:49,439
peat and and dilute it accordingly uh

914
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:51,278
blend it together

915
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,640
and that gives you a pretty good balance

916
00:31:51,278 --> 00:31:54,640
for most seed starts because because

917
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,320
you're absolutely right they don't need

918
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:59,759
in fact a lot of a lot of nutrition at

919
00:31:56,319 --> 00:32:01,678
that front end can work negatively

920
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:02,879
so you do want to modify that to some

921
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:04,480
extent the other question that we get

922
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,919
asked a lot is uh

923
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,880
you know how to i'm not ready to use my

924
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:09,919
soil right away uh how do i store it and

925
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,320
people think that you know

926
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:13,919
if they have to leave the soil for

927
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:16,558
months at a time before they're going to

928
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:18,559
they're going to plant into it will they

929
00:32:16,558 --> 00:32:20,319
will they will the soil deteriorate will

930
00:32:18,558 --> 00:32:21,918
it lose its viability which of course it

931
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:24,480
does not do but

932
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:26,000
um just just simply storing the soil

933
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,120
people say was it okay we store it in

934
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,398
our basement or in our garage and

935
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:30,639
whatnot and

936
00:32:28,398 --> 00:32:32,319
and and we point out to them no i mean

937
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,840
which ideally what you want to do is

938
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:34,398
keep it outside keep it in the elements

939
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:35,678
keep it where

940
00:32:34,398 --> 00:32:37,038
at least it's going to get the moisture

941
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:38,000
from the rains and whatnot you don't

942
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:39,200
want it

943
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,720
someplace where it's underneath a

944
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,120
downspout sort of thing where it's

945
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,679
getting

946
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:45,599
all the nutrients flushed out of it but

947
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:47,679
the rain and the snow and whatnot is

948
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:48,798
is actually good for that soil it's not

949
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:52,720
going to be a negative

950
00:32:48,798 --> 00:32:54,558
impact on it yeah i always tell people

951
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,558
in terms of storage is to treat the soil

952
00:32:54,558 --> 00:32:57,839
like it has a plant in it all the time

953
00:32:56,558 --> 00:32:59,599
if you do that you're maintaining the

954
00:32:57,839 --> 00:33:02,240
moisture content where it needs to be

955
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:03,439
and that soil is going to stay more

956
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:07,038
fertile

957
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:09,120
i do warn people to avoid

958
00:33:07,038 --> 00:33:10,558
you know leaching of nutrients if they

959
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:13,038
want that soil to maintain the same

960
00:33:10,558 --> 00:33:14,398
fertility because certain things

961
00:33:13,038 --> 00:33:17,200
are going to leach out quicker than

962
00:33:14,398 --> 00:33:19,839
others nitrogen and potassium

963
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,558
are the two main ones sodium will leach

964
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:23,759
out which is

965
00:33:20,558 --> 00:33:25,519
a good thing in most cases

966
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:27,038
but that's why for example if you get a

967
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:28,000
standard soil test it's not going to

968
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:29,599
give you a night for

969
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,519
you know your field soil it's not going

970
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:33,278
to give you a nitrogen recommendation

971
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:34,880
on there because it's going to assume

972
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:35,919
that i mean especially here in the

973
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,919
pacific northwest

974
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:39,200
that rain has leached all the available

975
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:40,880
nitrogen

976
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,480
or nitrates out of the soil and you

977
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:45,919
really need to add those

978
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:47,679
in the spring so that's just one

979
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:49,120
caution i would have for people is if

980
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:49,759
you're going to store your soil and it

981
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:51,759
is getting

982
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:53,278
leached do plan on adding at least some

983
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:56,240
of those more mobile

984
00:33:53,278 --> 00:33:57,440
cations back into the soil prior to

985
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,159
planting

986
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,640
right right and you know i like to throw

987
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:03,440
you know

988
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:04,799
a compost tea or a handful of alfalfa

989
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:08,720
meal just something maybe

990
00:34:04,798 --> 00:34:08,719
a diluted molasses water

991
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:12,398
rinse just something to get the biology

992
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:13,838
up and active again

993
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:15,759
you know a week or two prior to i plan

994
00:34:13,838 --> 00:34:16,719
on using it but um

995
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,760
you're right the majority of the

996
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:21,598
nutrients are staying put

997
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:25,040
soil store is just fine it does great in

998
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:27,280
nature these microbes are very resilient

999
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:28,878
whether they insist or go dormant

1000
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,480
they're surviving the process too

1001
00:34:28,878 --> 00:34:32,799
you know they've adapted to a lot of the

1002
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:36,480
conditions that you described

1003
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:39,519
so yeah don't throw away your soil

1004
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:42,800
what about um in in in your market area

1005
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:43,759
um i've seen references to vegan only

1006
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:47,440
soil mixes

1007
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:49,119
where some people are quite concerned

1008
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,358
about

1009
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:52,800
ethically the the ethical versus the

1010
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:55,918
pragmatic

1011
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,800
amendment usage um so i mean obviously

1012
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:58,000
someone who is

1013
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,680
concerned about that sort of thing is

1014
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,119
going to be reluctant to perhaps use

1015
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:05,919
blood bone and

1016
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:05,920
feather meal and the soil mixes um

1017
00:35:07,358 --> 00:35:14,799
is that a a huge a a significant aspect

1018
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,800
of your market demand

1019
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:19,358
you know it hasn't been i am currently

1020
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:22,079
as of like last week

1021
00:35:19,358 --> 00:35:23,358
talking to one facility in oklahoma that

1022
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:26,480
wants to move

1023
00:35:23,358 --> 00:35:29,199
towards a veganic or vegan

1024
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,880
soil mix and i said that's absolutely

1025
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:31,358
something i'd be happy to help you with

1026
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:35,358
so we're

1027
00:35:31,358 --> 00:35:37,119
we're talking about that right now um

1028
00:35:35,358 --> 00:35:39,519
it is a thing there are a lot of people

1029
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:41,519
that believe in um

1030
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:43,039
in growing using vegan inputs and

1031
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:45,759
frankly i don't have

1032
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:47,599
um i don't have a strong opinion either

1033
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,359
way i'm not personally a vegan but i

1034
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:51,838
respect people that are

1035
00:35:49,358 --> 00:35:52,559
in that life choice um there's certain

1036
00:35:51,838 --> 00:35:54,719
things that

1037
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:56,639
are and are not allowed in vegan

1038
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:59,199
production and that list sometimes gets

1039
00:35:56,639 --> 00:35:59,199
a little

1040
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,960
a little a little murky in the sense

1041
00:36:01,358 --> 00:36:05,358
that

1042
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,320
some vegans are okay i think with the

1043
00:36:05,358 --> 00:36:10,159
use of uh

1044
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:11,359
insect poop um but other people are not

1045
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:13,759
earthworm casting

1046
00:36:11,358 --> 00:36:14,960
seemed to be okay it's you know again

1047
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:18,400
that's a

1048
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,920
that's a a manure product um

1049
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,920
if it were me where i would draw the

1050
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,400
line if i really wanted to take a stand

1051
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:26,159
on this

1052
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:27,680
i would look at our industrial

1053
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:29,598
food chain and say i don't want to use

1054
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:33,039
anything that comes from

1055
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:36,400
slaughterhouses or from um you know

1056
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:38,159
our fisheries uh that that that to me is

1057
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,838
a more sustainable approach

1058
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:41,759
to this but you could absolutely

1059
00:36:39,838 --> 00:36:43,279
formulate around

1060
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,920
these challenges it's just going to

1061
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,720
raise the cost in some cases because you

1062
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,880
still need

1063
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:50,319
all your major you know micro and macro

1064
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,838
nutrients the plant still needs these

1065
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,640
elements so where are you getting them

1066
00:36:51,838 --> 00:36:57,199
well

1067
00:36:52,639 --> 00:37:00,000
most vegan sources are quite low in

1068
00:36:57,199 --> 00:37:01,679
some of these specific things so they're

1069
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,800
a little harder to track down it's

1070
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:04,879
really easy to get

1071
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,160
nitrogen and phosphorus from some of

1072
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:09,599
these animal-based

1073
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:11,199
products well it is and and i and i'm

1074
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,880
again i don't want to be perceived

1075
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:13,519
making the argument one way or the other

1076
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,800
but i

1077
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:19,679
i also am aware that i mean

1078
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:21,359
if we can't use these waste products the

1079
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:22,078
bone meal the feather meal for instance

1080
00:37:21,358 --> 00:37:24,639
tremendous

1081
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:25,920
tremendous amount of of uh feather meal

1082
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:28,319
from the from the you know

1083
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,440
our poultry industries and and uh the

1084
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,920
blood meal and whatnot

1085
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:33,760
um then it i mean the only other real

1086
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,240
alternative is it just becomes landfill

1087
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,560
i guess

1088
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:37,439
at some level so if we can take those

1089
00:37:36,559 --> 00:37:39,440
products and

1090
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,679
and turn them into our soil let the

1091
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:45,280
biology work on them and and

1092
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:48,319
and transform them into vital plant

1093
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:49,760
growth uh substances then

1094
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:53,519
i think that needs to be factored into

1095
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:53,520
some of these discussions too at times

1096
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:58,000
yeah i mean technically uh vegans won't

1097
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,240
use honey

1098
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,760
in a lot of cases or consume honey

1099
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:04,479
because that's the

1100
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:05,599
manipulation or exploitation of

1101
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,440
honeybees

1102
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:09,519
um you know something that we formed a

1103
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:12,000
symbiotic relationship with

1104
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:13,358
one could argue in terms of species to

1105
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,519
species

1106
00:38:13,358 --> 00:38:19,838
so um you know it is what it is

1107
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:21,679
but um yep that is an interesting

1108
00:38:19,838 --> 00:38:23,519
question i do have a blog post that

1109
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:24,719
lists a bunch of vegan inputs for people

1110
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:26,480
that want to make

1111
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:28,319
a vegan soil that would be a good

1112
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:30,480
starting point on our blog page

1113
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:33,359
um and i'm working on a new mix right

1114
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:36,320
now here in the u.s that would be

1115
00:38:33,358 --> 00:38:38,239
more sustainable using uh you know i've

1116
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:41,440
cut out a lot of those major inputs

1117
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:42,000
um trying to trying to consider these

1118
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:46,320
things

1119
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:50,000
as uh as something for growers too so

1120
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:53,200
it's a good question yeah

1121
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,400
um well let's see here i'm looking

1122
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:54,799
through the list of questions that i

1123
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,838
have

1124
00:38:54,800 --> 00:39:00,320
from you that we've talked about already

1125
00:38:58,838 --> 00:39:02,639
um

1126
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,920
did you want to touch it all on this

1127
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:07,838
idea of

1128
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:11,519
um water only i know that's something

1129
00:39:07,838 --> 00:39:14,400
that you i think you get asked a lot

1130
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:14,800
do you consider the soils water only

1131
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,320
what

1132
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:20,320
how are growers using the soil mix

1133
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:22,559
in most of in most of the situations and

1134
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:29,280
the growers that you work with

1135
00:39:22,559 --> 00:39:32,159
well yeah water only is a term that um

1136
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,960
i get hung up on a little bit at times

1137
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:36,799
and yet i

1138
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:40,559
i use it all the time i mean water only

1139
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:43,599
implies that the soil has

1140
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:44,078
the ideal blend of all the various

1141
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:46,720
different

1142
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:47,280
nutrients that the plant is going to

1143
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:50,879
need

1144
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:54,079
from sprout to harvest

1145
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:56,079
in the balance and the ratios

1146
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:57,359
and the ideal balance ratios that it's

1147
00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:00,800
going to require

1148
00:39:57,358 --> 00:40:01,598
um irrelevant or completely independent

1149
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,079
of the genetic

1150
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:05,599
needs of that particular plant and and

1151
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:08,480
that that's a huge

1152
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:11,119
um demand to put up on any soil mix i

1153
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:15,358
mean it just it just won't do that

1154
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:17,680
water only i think comes into play

1155
00:40:15,358 --> 00:40:18,639
for people who are starting out on their

1156
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:21,598
their first

1157
00:40:18,639 --> 00:40:22,159
living soil journey um they can grow a

1158
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:25,920
very

1159
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:27,679
decent uh harvest by just simply

1160
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,838
maintaining the proper moisture level of

1161
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:31,358
their soil and and giving their plant

1162
00:40:29,838 --> 00:40:33,039
the water that it requires

1163
00:40:31,358 --> 00:40:35,598
and they'll they'll do very well with

1164
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:37,199
that but that also

1165
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,800
there are also plenty of growers who

1166
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:41,118
have gotten beyond that who

1167
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,880
are quite capable of that they

1168
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:44,000
understand perhaps the the particular

1169
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,680
genetics that they're growing and the

1170
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,519
nutritional demands that that

1171
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:49,358
that particular strain or variety might

1172
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:50,960
might

1173
00:40:49,358 --> 00:40:53,039
that might enhance its growth and

1174
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:56,240
they're capable of uh adding

1175
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:57,119
the extra teas the uh maybe top

1176
00:40:56,239 --> 00:40:58,719
dressings

1177
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:00,160
at the at the right stage of the plant

1178
00:40:58,719 --> 00:41:04,838
growth and that sort of thing

1179
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:09,039
to further tweak that that plant

1180
00:41:04,838 --> 00:41:11,519
expression so um

1181
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:12,559
i i just think that sometimes water only

1182
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:14,800
is is it's

1183
00:41:12,559 --> 00:41:17,039
it just needs it needs that extra

1184
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:20,318
context of of that term that

1185
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:22,079
that it it's great as a as a sort of an

1186
00:41:20,318 --> 00:41:24,400
overall approach

1187
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:25,760
but that's not to say that you can't

1188
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,838
move beyond that and

1189
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,520
and be more target specific in your in

1190
00:41:27,838 --> 00:41:30,078
your growing habits and that just comes

1191
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:34,559
from a

1192
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:36,160
experienced gardener's approach

1193
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:38,400
yeah i know when i first started with

1194
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:41,118
this what's now called living soils

1195
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,960
um i was going for something with the

1196
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:44,640
idea being that if you were a

1197
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,639
medical or cancer patient you could walk

1198
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:49,199
into a grow store and get a bag of soil

1199
00:41:46,639 --> 00:41:50,879
and walk out and just water your plants

1200
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:52,879
so it's really more about simplicity

1201
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,960
rather than

1202
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:57,119
maybe what's you know optimal and now

1203
00:41:54,960 --> 00:42:00,400
that we're talking about people using it

1204
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:03,519
in facilities commercially looking at

1205
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:06,720
more sophisticated ways i do think

1206
00:42:03,519 --> 00:42:08,639
small inputs that are targeted at stages

1207
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:10,078
of growth can increase your overall

1208
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:13,039
yield

1209
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:14,000
and fertility so i i would totally agree

1210
00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:16,000
with that but

1211
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,880
yeah for me water only started because

1212
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:22,239
of of sort of that

1213
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:25,200
that concept more so than than um

1214
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:25,679
necessarily maximizing yield or health

1215
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:28,000
right

1216
00:42:25,679 --> 00:42:28,799
right but but you can go water and still

1217
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,358
get a really

1218
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,000
a good look absolutely so that's not off

1219
00:42:31,358 --> 00:42:34,559
the table

1220
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,679
if that's the level of uh you know

1221
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:36,639
horticulture that you're comfortable

1222
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:38,318
with

1223
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:40,159
i mean we mentioned clax mix but there

1224
00:42:38,318 --> 00:42:42,480
are other mix there i mean you

1225
00:42:40,159 --> 00:42:44,399
google soil recipes and there are

1226
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:47,440
thousands of them on the internet just

1227
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,480
slight variations of similar themes but

1228
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,000
there i mean there are

1229
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,679
a number of recipes out there too that

1230
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,039
took sort of the opposite approach where

1231
00:42:51,679 --> 00:42:53,759
they tried to throw absolutely

1232
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:57,358
everything

1233
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:58,640
at their soil and it was sort of the

1234
00:42:57,358 --> 00:43:01,759
kitchen what i call the

1235
00:42:58,639 --> 00:43:03,838
kitchen sink approach and um

1236
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:05,920
but we spoke a moment ago about the

1237
00:43:03,838 --> 00:43:09,440
complexity of the of the kix

1238
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:12,559
kiss mix by comparison um

1239
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:15,760
but i think in the earlier days of soil

1240
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:17,920
recipes soil making

1241
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:19,280
they were trying to throw everything at

1242
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:22,159
that soil with

1243
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:23,359
the attitude that the more the better

1244
00:43:22,159 --> 00:43:25,039
and i think that you know

1245
00:43:23,358 --> 00:43:26,799
fortunately today we we've got an

1246
00:43:25,039 --> 00:43:28,239
understanding of where that happy medium

1247
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,920
space is where

1248
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:31,598
you do have some sort of disciplined

1249
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:33,519
approach to your nutritional profile

1250
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:37,359
that you're building in that soil

1251
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:39,199
and just letting that work its magic

1252
00:43:37,358 --> 00:43:41,279
yeah i want to caution folks in the idea

1253
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:42,639
that yes you can put a lot into the soil

1254
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:46,000
but it needs to be balanced

1255
00:43:42,639 --> 00:43:47,838
so and it needs to be balanced around

1256
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,519
your compost sources so

1257
00:43:47,838 --> 00:43:51,039
when you see these recipes online and

1258
00:43:49,519 --> 00:43:54,800
i've seen

1259
00:43:51,039 --> 00:43:56,559
thousands by now in all these forums

1260
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,400
what they're not taking into account is

1261
00:43:56,559 --> 00:43:59,199
that you're probably not using the exact

1262
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,760
same

1263
00:43:59,199 --> 00:44:03,358
compost sources and that really throws

1264
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,560
off the mix

1265
00:44:03,358 --> 00:44:06,480
because that's what you're formulating

1266
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:09,119
around and i think people need to be

1267
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:10,639
aware of that so it's not just about any

1268
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:12,318
recipe it's about it you know it needs

1269
00:44:10,639 --> 00:44:15,358
to be formulated around what you have

1270
00:44:12,318 --> 00:44:17,279
and what you're using on that end so

1271
00:44:15,358 --> 00:44:19,358
so there's that that i want to touch on

1272
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:22,240
but

1273
00:44:19,358 --> 00:44:23,679
i think in terms of complexity it's

1274
00:44:22,239 --> 00:44:24,959
really all about balance so

1275
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:28,078
one of the things we haven't talked

1276
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:30,318
about yet is when we first mix the soil

1277
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:31,200
you send off samples for lab testing we

1278
00:44:30,318 --> 00:44:34,000
got those back

1279
00:44:31,199 --> 00:44:35,358
and then we just started tweaking so i'd

1280
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,358
have you make some adjustments

1281
00:44:35,358 --> 00:44:39,358
you would take that mix mix it up again

1282
00:44:37,358 --> 00:44:41,759
send those off to the lab and it

1283
00:44:39,358 --> 00:44:43,838
it took quite a few tests before we got

1284
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:46,160
to a point where i was like hey

1285
00:44:43,838 --> 00:44:48,078
this this looks right now let's start

1286
00:44:46,159 --> 00:44:48,960
doing plant trials so the first thing is

1287
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:50,720
the mixing

1288
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:52,639
the next thing is the testing until you

1289
00:44:50,719 --> 00:44:55,358
feel like you've hit that balance

1290
00:44:52,639 --> 00:44:56,639
you like the numbers and then you get

1291
00:44:55,358 --> 00:44:59,279
into plant trials

1292
00:44:56,639 --> 00:44:59,920
um at that point so it was a process you

1293
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,800
know

1294
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:03,680
and it is it costs some money too to get

1295
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:06,560
you don't hit it

1296
00:45:03,679 --> 00:45:07,838
right off the bat you know i think with

1297
00:45:06,559 --> 00:45:09,679
some experience

1298
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:11,279
and having formulated a lot of soils it

1299
00:45:09,679 --> 00:45:12,159
allowed us to start a little bit closer

1300
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:14,880
maybe

1301
00:45:12,159 --> 00:45:15,759
to our goal but you know you're not

1302
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:18,318
going to nail it

1303
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:19,760
on your first mix absolutely not

1304
00:45:18,318 --> 00:45:22,000
absolutely not

1305
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:24,319
and of course i mean that that also you

1306
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:28,639
can point to the value of uh

1307
00:45:24,318 --> 00:45:30,800
for some of the larger uh producers of

1308
00:45:28,639 --> 00:45:32,719
sap testing and tissue testing that

1309
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:36,079
allows them to

1310
00:45:32,719 --> 00:45:38,799
still analyze the

1311
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:41,920
the fertility needs of their plants

1312
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,920
generally that tends to be

1313
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:50,240
well both indoors and and outdoor uh

1314
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:50,720
field growing products but um you you

1315
00:45:50,239 --> 00:45:52,639
just

1316
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:54,959
there are there are still tools that you

1317
00:45:52,639 --> 00:45:57,519
can move forward from even that point

1318
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:59,119
and and really dial in your plants

1319
00:45:57,519 --> 00:46:01,759
requirements if that's the path that you

1320
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:05,280
really want to go down

1321
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:07,440
yeah absolutely and when you mention um

1322
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:09,200
the the sap testing and thing or the

1323
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:12,000
sorry the tissue testing

1324
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:13,358
and things like that uh part of part of

1325
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,079
dialing that in allows us to add

1326
00:46:13,358 --> 00:46:16,719
nutrients

1327
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:18,079
you know mid-cycle and make improvements

1328
00:46:16,719 --> 00:46:20,879
but this is also

1329
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:22,640
uh our best guess for a variety of

1330
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:25,358
cultivars that all fall under the

1331
00:46:22,639 --> 00:46:26,480
you know the the classification of

1332
00:46:25,358 --> 00:46:29,679
cannabis so

1333
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:31,440
you know different strains or cultivars

1334
00:46:29,679 --> 00:46:33,118
are going to pull up nutrients at

1335
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,400
different rates and that's something

1336
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:37,039
that

1337
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:38,559
needs to be factored in as well you know

1338
00:46:37,039 --> 00:46:40,800
some call them heavy feeders

1339
00:46:38,559 --> 00:46:42,719
versus light feeders some people say

1340
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:45,359
some plants are more sensitive

1341
00:46:42,719 --> 00:46:46,719
but ultimately we have a pretty big

1342
00:46:45,358 --> 00:46:49,199
genetic variety

1343
00:46:46,719 --> 00:46:51,679
that falls under the canopy of cannabis

1344
00:46:49,199 --> 00:46:54,399
and so

1345
00:46:51,679 --> 00:46:54,960
no mix is going to be perfect for all of

1346
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,039
them

1347
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:59,199
uh and that's where you can sort of

1348
00:46:57,039 --> 00:47:00,880
start with a really good premium soil

1349
00:46:59,199 --> 00:47:02,399
and then sort of tweak it based on

1350
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:03,680
on the mix ears growing and then also

1351
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,960
realizing that they're going to pull

1352
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:07,598
different levels of nutrients

1353
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:09,280
out of each soil mix too so absolutely

1354
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:11,359
absolutely so when it comes time to

1355
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:12,720
you know in between cycles to re-amend

1356
00:47:11,358 --> 00:47:14,400
um you want to have a

1357
00:47:12,719 --> 00:47:16,399
you want to have a pretty uh good idea

1358
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:18,160
of what the proper approach to to

1359
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:20,079
rebalancing that soil again is going to

1360
00:47:18,159 --> 00:47:22,239
look like

1361
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:23,839
yeah and that's something else uh you

1362
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:24,318
know you and i have worked on a nutrient

1363
00:47:23,838 --> 00:47:26,480
pack

1364
00:47:24,318 --> 00:47:28,719
as well for canada too so that people

1365
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:30,639
can not only mix their own soil uh

1366
00:47:28,719 --> 00:47:32,799
if they're not able to have it shipped

1367
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:33,679
due to shipping cost for the you know

1368
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:36,480
the peat and the

1369
00:47:33,679 --> 00:47:38,000
perlite and all those things but also

1370
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,760
when they go to re-amend the soil

1371
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,039
this is sort of our best guess based on

1372
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:43,280
the average plant

1373
00:47:41,039 --> 00:47:44,558
but if you get a soil test you could

1374
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:47,440
custom

1375
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:48,400
or dial in that even further in a lot of

1376
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:51,119
cases

1377
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:51,519
yeah the re-amendment i mean the expanse

1378
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:53,838
of

1379
00:47:51,519 --> 00:47:55,599
of shipping soils across canada just you

1380
00:47:53,838 --> 00:47:58,078
know is hard to justify

1381
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:59,039
in some scenarios and the re-amendment

1382
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:01,599
pack

1383
00:47:59,039 --> 00:48:03,119
was a good solution to get the core

1384
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:03,760
materials out there and people let

1385
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:05,440
people

1386
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:07,119
you know use the compost and the peat

1387
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:08,800
and the and the pearlite or the

1388
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:10,640
the aeration ingredient that they can

1389
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:13,839
find in their own backyards

1390
00:48:10,639 --> 00:48:16,960
um but yeah that that

1391
00:48:13,838 --> 00:48:19,039
that creates a you know a pretty

1392
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:21,280
serious starting point but but then

1393
00:48:19,039 --> 00:48:23,679
doing further soil analysis and

1394
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:24,319
and trying to modify that mix according

1395
00:48:23,679 --> 00:48:27,279
to what that

1396
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:28,719
analysis tells you um out of a good lab

1397
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:30,400
where you're getting uh where you're

1398
00:48:28,719 --> 00:48:34,480
getting the proper results

1399
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:35,599
is is is very valuable

1400
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:37,039
yeah and you have to stay with the same

1401
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:38,640
lab because you can't really compare

1402
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:40,558
these test results across different labs

1403
00:48:38,639 --> 00:48:42,558
and make good decisions

1404
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:44,640
so we use logan i know they're really

1405
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:45,760
popular kind of most of the industry has

1406
00:48:44,639 --> 00:48:48,799
gone to them

1407
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:50,720
they got lucky in that regard but uh

1408
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:52,480
you know when i see a logan test now i

1409
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:54,558
could look at it really quickly and at a

1410
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:57,440
glance see what the limiting factor of

1411
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:58,559
growth is most likely in that soil mix

1412
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:01,519
and that's an advantage

1413
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:03,040
of using the same lab over and over

1414
00:49:01,519 --> 00:49:06,239
again

1415
00:49:03,039 --> 00:49:08,558
yes and so we you know

1416
00:49:06,239 --> 00:49:10,159
between you and i we kind of also had uh

1417
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:12,800
you look at anl labs

1418
00:49:10,159 --> 00:49:13,199
we tend to use a l labs here in ontario

1419
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:16,400
which

1420
00:49:13,199 --> 00:49:18,480
they have a western office as well too

1421
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:20,400
but it took a little bit of review on

1422
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:22,880
your part to compare that to your logan

1423
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:26,639
to a logan lab analysis just to

1424
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:28,640
calibrate the two so that you could

1425
00:49:26,639 --> 00:49:30,879
feel confident but confident about what

1426
00:49:28,639 --> 00:49:33,920
a labs results were telling you

1427
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:35,920
as we both know every lab result is

1428
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:37,358
every lab that you're using is going to

1429
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:39,519
provide

1430
00:49:37,358 --> 00:49:41,440
slightly different test results and and

1431
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:44,960
logan's has become sort of the

1432
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:47,838
standard go-to in the us up until

1433
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:48,960
just uh just the beginning of this year

1434
00:49:47,838 --> 00:49:51,440
we had no problem

1435
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:52,800
sending soil samples down to logan labs

1436
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:55,440
in ohio

1437
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:56,240
they had a on their website a pdf that

1438
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:58,079
allowed you

1439
00:49:56,239 --> 00:49:59,439
to print off the documents and and

1440
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:01,280
accompany your shipment and it went

1441
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:03,679
across no problem but

1442
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:04,720
um i was talking to them there a week a

1443
00:50:03,679 --> 00:50:08,078
week and a half ago and

1444
00:50:04,719 --> 00:50:09,759
apparently the department of agriculture

1445
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:12,079
has come out with uh completely

1446
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:13,920
different uh requirements for

1447
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:16,400
moving products across the border now

1448
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:18,079
and it's not anywhere near as easy as it

1449
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:19,599
used to be

1450
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:22,559
i wasn't aware of that that's good to

1451
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:24,720
know that's unfortunate

1452
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:26,000
well i mean ultimately it doesn't

1453
00:50:24,719 --> 00:50:27,759
there's nothing

1454
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,199
i guess special in the sense that there

1455
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:30,400
are a lot of labs running the same test

1456
00:50:29,199 --> 00:50:30,879
but you need to know what tests they're

1457
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,720
running

1458
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:34,880
um in the case of logan we're looking at

1459
00:50:32,719 --> 00:50:36,000
a malik 3 and a saturated paste

1460
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:37,920
and then you just need to make sure that

1461
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,599
it's a you're looking well you know

1462
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:41,119
understand the complexity of the

1463
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:42,640
particular

1464
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:44,000
methodology or soil test that they're

1465
00:50:42,639 --> 00:50:45,358
running and then you stay with the same

1466
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,719
one over and over again so you can

1467
00:50:45,358 --> 00:50:48,799
correlate results across

1468
00:50:46,719 --> 00:50:50,799
different samples yeah so that's the key

1469
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:54,318
point there it doesn't have to be logan

1470
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:55,599
consistency is is critical

1471
00:50:54,318 --> 00:50:58,159
yeah and then i know you and i are

1472
00:50:55,599 --> 00:51:02,400
talking uh you were able to

1473
00:50:58,159 --> 00:51:05,598
uh find a way to essentially prill

1474
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:07,119
material uh in terms of a nutrient pack

1475
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:10,640
which i was pretty excited

1476
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:11,920
to hear and i mean

1477
00:51:10,639 --> 00:51:15,199
i'm open to saying on air what we're

1478
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:18,559
working on right now in those regards

1479
00:51:15,199 --> 00:51:21,118
yeah the prilling is just

1480
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:23,920
it it's just a convenience factor for

1481
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:25,920
the end user plus it also

1482
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:27,358
greatly cuts down the dust that can come

1483
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,880
from just blending up a bunch of

1484
00:51:27,358 --> 00:51:29,679
different materials and throwing it into

1485
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,920
a bag

1486
00:51:29,679 --> 00:51:33,118
so prilling is just adding a lignin as a

1487
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:36,159
binder that uh

1488
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:38,960
turns it into a into a consistent uh

1489
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:39,598
texture and it makes handling the

1490
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:43,199
product

1491
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:45,440
uh very very uh safe and sensible

1492
00:51:43,199 --> 00:51:50,000
and uh that made a big difference in

1493
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:53,358
terms of our amendment product as we got

1494
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,358
our first prill batch back

1495
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:57,519
yeah i'm i'm wishing i could do that

1496
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:59,039
down here i haven't had a good source

1497
00:51:57,519 --> 00:52:00,960
that's wanted to work with me on that so

1498
00:51:59,039 --> 00:52:04,480
we're still doing a lot of this

1499
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:06,720
mixing uh by hand and it's not prilled

1500
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:08,318
but uh you and i are working right now

1501
00:52:06,719 --> 00:52:10,959
on a

1502
00:52:08,318 --> 00:52:12,400
grow and bloom formula that would be

1503
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:14,400
prilled in a fertilizer that would be

1504
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:15,519
able to be available both in the u.s and

1505
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,280
canada

1506
00:52:15,519 --> 00:52:20,000
the same product because i know your

1507
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:21,760
experience with logistics would allow

1508
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,679
us to get stuff down here so i'm really

1509
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:26,720
excited for that for people who don't

1510
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:28,480
want to necessarily

1511
00:52:26,719 --> 00:52:29,919
you know go with the soil or want to be

1512
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:31,519
able to add fertility throughout the

1513
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:34,079
growth cycle so

1514
00:52:31,519 --> 00:52:36,400
you know i'm looking at targeting uh

1515
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:38,720
certain ratios with certain amendments

1516
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:41,200
uh based on the sustainability of those

1517
00:52:38,719 --> 00:52:43,279
amendments and the mpk levels as well

1518
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:45,598
and and some of those things and i'm

1519
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:47,119
really excited to

1520
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:48,559
you know go through the same similar

1521
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:50,079
process we went with the soil it might

1522
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:50,480
take a little while but i know we'll get

1523
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:54,559
there

1524
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:56,639
and yeah i'm looking forward to that too

1525
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:58,960
yeah that's something that uh we get

1526
00:52:56,639 --> 00:53:00,400
asked for all the time

1527
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:02,159
and and i think that that comes out of

1528
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:03,920
some of the

1529
00:53:02,159 --> 00:53:06,078
the background of growers who are coming

1530
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:08,800
from a hydroponic uh

1531
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:10,480
past and um they're used to adding

1532
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:12,559
various different nutrients at different

1533
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:16,559
stages of growth and whatnot

1534
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:18,800
um and um so it's

1535
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:20,559
it's it's a product that the market

1536
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:24,400
certainly is used to using and

1537
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:25,760
and and is asking for um so to

1538
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:27,920
you know it'd be nice if we can develop

1539
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:29,520
our own that uh

1540
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:31,760
meets those needs in the same way that

1541
00:53:29,519 --> 00:53:34,400
the soil mix did

1542
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:35,599
yeah so uh one other thing i want to ask

1543
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:37,519
you is what

1544
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:39,440
you know as someone who who interacts

1545
00:53:37,519 --> 00:53:42,400
with a ton of growers

1546
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:44,079
on a daily basis what are the typical

1547
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:46,559
you know sorts of like

1548
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:47,920
questions that you get asked or problems

1549
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:52,000
that you find

1550
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:52,000
growers come across the most

1551
00:53:52,239 --> 00:53:56,000
i know that's a really really big

1552
00:53:54,838 --> 00:54:00,239
question

1553
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,800
yeah um we spend a tremendous amount of

1554
00:54:00,239 --> 00:54:04,078
time

1555
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:06,400
answering questions and uh educating

1556
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:08,079
um again again that that just points to

1557
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:09,760
the comments i made in our the earlier

1558
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:10,480
part of a conversation about kind of

1559
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:14,079
still it's an

1560
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:16,559
an emerging market as such and and

1561
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:18,160
there's such a hunger out there um on

1562
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:20,800
the part of growers for

1563
00:54:18,159 --> 00:54:22,159
more and more information once you start

1564
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,720
going down this rabbit hole i don't need

1565
00:54:22,159 --> 00:54:24,318
to tell you

1566
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:26,959
it gets pretty fascinating pretty

1567
00:54:24,318 --> 00:54:30,159
quickly and and people can be here

1568
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:32,079
all the time and with uh or emailing us

1569
00:54:30,159 --> 00:54:35,358
all the time with questions

1570
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:35,760
they're pretty s pretty broad ranging

1571
00:54:35,358 --> 00:54:39,838
and

1572
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:39,839
pretty standard um

1573
00:54:40,239 --> 00:54:43,838
i'd be hard-pressed to really

1574
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:48,318
pick a you know a question or two that

1575
00:54:46,798 --> 00:54:51,039
that stood out i

1576
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:52,798
i i just i you know i'd have to comment

1577
00:54:51,039 --> 00:54:54,798
that

1578
00:54:52,798 --> 00:54:57,119
the challenge probably the main

1579
00:54:54,798 --> 00:54:59,280
challenge that we face is is that

1580
00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:01,358
that that person who has had a a

1581
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:01,599
hydroponic background who who started

1582
00:55:01,358 --> 00:55:03,920
off

1583
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:05,920
using bottle nutrients in some fashion

1584
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:08,880
maybe a pro-mix

1585
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:09,440
medium that they were growing in and

1586
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:13,039
they

1587
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:16,159
they discover the

1588
00:55:13,039 --> 00:55:18,239
living soil option they they

1589
00:55:16,159 --> 00:55:19,199
hear about it from from a fellow grower

1590
00:55:18,239 --> 00:55:20,639
or a friend

1591
00:55:19,199 --> 00:55:22,879
or they read about it and they get all

1592
00:55:20,639 --> 00:55:24,639
excited about it and uh

1593
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:26,318
get this real passion for wanting to try

1594
00:55:24,639 --> 00:55:28,400
this out and and and

1595
00:55:26,318 --> 00:55:30,960
come in and you know get what they need

1596
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:33,599
to for the first girl and whatnot

1597
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:35,358
um and so they're they're they're

1598
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:37,280
they're leaping in with one foot

1599
00:55:35,358 --> 00:55:39,119
into the living soil end of the pool but

1600
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:41,920
they just can't seem to pull

1601
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:43,039
their hydroponic foot out of that end of

1602
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:46,720
the pool so

1603
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:48,558
they they hang on to understandings

1604
00:55:46,719 --> 00:55:50,000
and and belief systems that that were

1605
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:52,880
relevant for you for

1606
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:54,798
for using um a cocoa or a pro mix with

1607
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:57,119
with bottled nutrients and whatnot

1608
00:55:54,798 --> 00:55:59,039
um but they don't those those

1609
00:55:57,119 --> 00:56:01,358
assumptions don't necessarily carry over

1610
00:55:59,039 --> 00:56:03,599
to a living soil so just sort of

1611
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:05,519
pointing out to them why they don't need

1612
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:06,318
to worry about certain things anymore

1613
00:56:05,519 --> 00:56:08,960
and

1614
00:56:06,318 --> 00:56:09,599
and and why they they do need to you

1615
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:11,920
know

1616
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:14,240
consider other aspects the differences

1617
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:16,480
between a soil approach

1618
00:56:14,239 --> 00:56:17,759
that probably is the i'd have to say is

1619
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:20,000
the singular most

1620
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:22,559
uh challenging issue that we face on a

1621
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:25,039
day-to-day basis

1622
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:25,680
yeah i was thinking about it once i

1623
00:56:25,039 --> 00:56:28,318
asked you

1624
00:56:25,679 --> 00:56:28,719
myself and i think that the two biggest

1625
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:32,079
things

1626
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:33,439
i come across are the challenge of

1627
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:35,760
watering correctly

1628
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:37,200
i think that the watering relates so

1629
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:40,480
much to the health of the plant i've

1630
00:56:37,199 --> 00:56:42,159
talked about it with multiple guests

1631
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,679
specifically the one with don marshall

1632
00:56:42,159 --> 00:56:45,440
if you listen to that podcast i think

1633
00:56:43,679 --> 00:56:47,039
that one is just a gem when it comes to

1634
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:49,838
talking about watering

1635
00:56:47,039 --> 00:56:51,039
so i'd suggest that for people but the

1636
00:56:49,838 --> 00:56:54,480
other question

1637
00:56:51,039 --> 00:56:55,039
that um the other or the other challenge

1638
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:58,639
i find

1639
00:56:55,039 --> 00:57:00,960
is that people do too much

1640
00:56:58,639 --> 00:57:02,078
right off the gate so you know they may

1641
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:04,639
switch to

1642
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:05,680
a living soil and then they start doing

1643
00:57:04,639 --> 00:57:08,239
all these k

1644
00:57:05,679 --> 00:57:09,838
f inputs and yeah you know because the

1645
00:57:08,239 --> 00:57:12,159
buddy told them those were good

1646
00:57:09,838 --> 00:57:13,599
and then they start doing uh you know

1647
00:57:12,159 --> 00:57:14,719
add this product from here and that

1648
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:15,599
product from there and all these

1649
00:57:14,719 --> 00:57:17,439
different

1650
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:18,720
you know secret sauces and the next

1651
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:20,798
thing you know you have this like

1652
00:57:18,719 --> 00:57:24,078
conglomeration of inputs

1653
00:57:20,798 --> 00:57:25,358
to where it's hard to know what was good

1654
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:27,280
and what was bad

1655
00:57:25,358 --> 00:57:29,039
so i i and i don't want to discourage

1656
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:30,000
people from experimentation but i'd say

1657
00:57:29,039 --> 00:57:31,599
you know

1658
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,760
start slow you know maybe just start

1659
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:34,079
with water or or do a couple beds with

1660
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:35,839
just

1661
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:37,359
water so you can get a baseline for how

1662
00:57:35,838 --> 00:57:40,558
the soil performs

1663
00:57:37,358 --> 00:57:42,480
and then you know if you want to do uh

1664
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:43,760
you know some inputs or some teas or

1665
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:46,960
things

1666
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:50,400
do them on on half your plants or a

1667
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:51,440
portion of your of your facility that

1668
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:53,280
you're dedicating to r

1669
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:54,720
d but when you start doing everything

1670
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:57,040
all at once

1671
00:57:54,719 --> 00:57:59,199
it just gets it gets really chaotic and

1672
00:57:57,039 --> 00:58:01,759
and it makes it really hard to know

1673
00:57:59,199 --> 00:58:03,838
what's going on and then along those

1674
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:05,680
lines if you were to say have a crop

1675
00:58:03,838 --> 00:58:07,838
loss or fail for heavy metals

1676
00:58:05,679 --> 00:58:09,440
then you have the challenge of like that

1677
00:58:07,838 --> 00:58:12,159
many more

1678
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:13,760
issues and it's it's a nightmare trying

1679
00:58:12,159 --> 00:58:14,078
to narrow it down to what contributed to

1680
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:16,319
that

1681
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:18,240
is almost impossible i i couldn't agree

1682
00:58:16,318 --> 00:58:20,159
more with you on that point ted because

1683
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:21,679
just trying to you know again pointing

1684
00:58:20,159 --> 00:58:22,399
at that enthusiasm and the passion that

1685
00:58:21,679 --> 00:58:24,159
that

1686
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:25,440
that customers come in here with and

1687
00:58:24,159 --> 00:58:26,879
just trying to hold their feet on the

1688
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:28,798
ground sometimes

1689
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:30,559
is is a bit of a challenge because

1690
00:58:28,798 --> 00:58:31,838
you're right they they want to try

1691
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:34,240
everything they've read about

1692
00:58:31,838 --> 00:58:35,599
16 different items and they got you know

1693
00:58:34,239 --> 00:58:36,719
they got their budget and they're

1694
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:38,160
they're going to buy 12 of them and

1695
00:58:36,719 --> 00:58:38,879
throw them at the garden sort of thing

1696
00:58:38,159 --> 00:58:41,199
and i say well

1697
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:42,079
hang on a sec here i mean how are you

1698
00:58:41,199 --> 00:58:43,598
going to know

1699
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:45,760
which ones are really giving you the

1700
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:47,119
results or which ones are giving you the

1701
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:51,119
problems

1702
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:55,119
when you're throwing multiple

1703
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:56,798
options at your your plants i mean uh

1704
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:58,798
that's very sound advice start with

1705
00:58:56,798 --> 00:59:00,400
water only your first grow

1706
00:58:58,798 --> 00:59:02,000
add something maybe a little fish

1707
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:04,000
hydrolysate or whatever it is

1708
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,760
that you want to try but try that on

1709
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,880
your second grow and realize that the

1710
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:08,319
only way you're going to become an

1711
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:09,680
experienced gardener

1712
00:59:08,318 --> 00:59:11,838
the only way you're really going to

1713
00:59:09,679 --> 00:59:14,960
develop a set of gardening

1714
00:59:11,838 --> 00:59:18,558
skills is by making mistakes

1715
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:20,318
but also buying observing

1716
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:22,000
the impacts of these decisions that

1717
00:59:20,318 --> 00:59:24,798
you're making on your soils and

1718
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,679
and for your plants and and knowing that

1719
00:59:24,798 --> 00:59:27,599
that

1720
00:59:25,679 --> 00:59:29,118
it was this particular product that had

1721
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:31,039
this particular impact

1722
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:32,160
when i was using this particular set of

1723
00:59:31,039 --> 00:59:35,679
genetics

1724
00:59:32,159 --> 00:59:38,318
there's so many variables and

1725
00:59:35,679 --> 00:59:41,039
throwing throwing too much at the that

1726
00:59:38,318 --> 00:59:43,279
you grow at any particular time

1727
00:59:41,039 --> 00:59:45,599
is generally not going to have too much

1728
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:47,359
of a positive benefit

1729
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:49,359
yeah i'd say keep that money in your

1730
00:59:47,358 --> 00:59:51,519
pocket put it towards a

1731
00:59:49,358 --> 00:59:53,679
par meter a dyno light some of these

1732
00:59:51,519 --> 00:59:55,039
tools that may be really useful a blue

1733
00:59:53,679 --> 00:59:57,440
map moisture meter

1734
00:59:55,039 --> 00:59:58,798
or some other way of measuring your your

1735
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:00,000
moisture in your soil

1736
00:59:58,798 --> 01:00:02,159
things that you're going to use grow

1737
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,039
after grow that are going to make you a

1738
01:00:02,159 --> 01:00:04,719
better grower

1739
01:00:03,039 --> 01:00:06,719
but you do get this sort of mad

1740
01:00:04,719 --> 01:00:08,798
scientist mentality where more is better

1741
01:00:06,719 --> 01:00:11,759
and you want to start fiddling and

1742
01:00:08,798 --> 01:00:12,318
you read about on this forum of you know

1743
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:15,440
people

1744
01:00:12,318 --> 01:00:18,480
using this input and you know

1745
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:19,280
fermenting that product and it's it gets

1746
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:21,760
a little

1747
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:22,798
uh it gets a little out of control i

1748
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:25,280
would say yeah

1749
01:00:22,798 --> 01:00:27,199
yeah and just how fun is it i mean a lot

1750
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:30,240
of people are awfully driven by

1751
01:00:27,199 --> 01:00:32,000
growing the biggest dankest plant they

1752
01:00:30,239 --> 01:00:34,558
possibly can and that that's great that

1753
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:36,079
that's fun i mean

1754
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:37,839
you look at the pumpkin guys who are

1755
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:38,640
constantly competing against each other

1756
01:00:37,838 --> 01:00:42,078
for the

1757
01:00:38,639 --> 01:00:42,960
for the biggest bestest but um uh just

1758
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:44,880
have fun at it

1759
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:46,400
and uh and take the time to really

1760
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:46,960
really observe what's going on in your

1761
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:49,920
garden

1762
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:52,079
um i think that that's uh that's good

1763
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:53,760
advice for anybody

1764
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:55,280
definitely definitely spend a little

1765
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:57,760
extra time in the garden is

1766
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:59,040
is huge it's going to make the biggest

1767
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:00,480
difference overall on your plant's

1768
01:00:59,039 --> 01:01:02,558
health

1769
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:05,358
you did mention genetics i think that is

1770
01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:08,160
something that gets overlooked too

1771
01:01:05,358 --> 01:01:09,119
genetics are going to play one of the

1772
01:01:08,159 --> 01:01:12,159
biggest roles

1773
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:14,640
overall in getting you that you know

1774
01:01:12,159 --> 01:01:15,440
biggest highest thc or highest

1775
01:01:14,639 --> 01:01:18,798
cannabinoid

1776
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:21,200
plant so i i think that's something to

1777
01:01:18,798 --> 01:01:23,199
highlight as well for folks so

1778
01:01:21,199 --> 01:01:24,480
yeah i you know i really enjoyed our

1779
01:01:23,199 --> 01:01:26,159
conversation today rob is there anything

1780
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:29,280
you want to add before we uh

1781
01:01:26,159 --> 01:01:32,239
before we sign off no i think that

1782
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:33,839
that uh that was fun i i i the only

1783
01:01:32,239 --> 01:01:36,879
thing i'd like to add is that i have

1784
01:01:33,838 --> 01:01:39,519
a tremendous appreciation for all of the

1785
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:41,119
help and support that you've provided

1786
01:01:39,519 --> 01:01:43,119
over the short bit of time that we've

1787
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:45,119
known each other and uh and i'm looking

1788
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:47,200
forward to uh

1789
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:48,559
to the next stage because uh if there's

1790
01:01:47,199 --> 01:01:49,759
one thing about gardening you're never

1791
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:52,720
there you never reach

1792
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:53,200
you never reach the finish line it seems

1793
01:01:52,719 --> 01:01:56,318
to

1794
01:01:53,199 --> 01:01:57,439
move as far ahead as as as you make the

1795
01:01:56,318 --> 01:01:59,679
effort to approach it

1796
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:03,200
and and you're always learning it's a

1797
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:03,199
it's a really exciting time to be

1798
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:08,798
looking down that rabbit hole of soil

1799
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:10,798
science uh that with with with the

1800
01:02:08,798 --> 01:02:11,920
environmental challenges that we have in

1801
01:02:10,798 --> 01:02:14,159
our world today

1802
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:16,639
and and for food production and yet

1803
01:02:14,159 --> 01:02:20,798
still trying to mitigate the impact of

1804
01:02:16,639 --> 01:02:23,038
um of our environmental degradation

1805
01:02:20,798 --> 01:02:24,079
there's a lot of really encouraging

1806
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:27,520
science that is

1807
01:02:24,079 --> 01:02:29,680
is pointing to the values of our

1808
01:02:27,519 --> 01:02:30,798
our soils and our plant interactions

1809
01:02:29,679 --> 01:02:34,239
with them and

1810
01:02:30,798 --> 01:02:35,199
it's a way of exploring that is if

1811
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:38,000
nothing more than

1812
01:02:35,199 --> 01:02:39,038
within a you know a 16 square foot patch

1813
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:42,480
of your basement it

1814
01:02:39,039 --> 01:02:45,760
uh it uh it can be quite a rewarding

1815
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:47,760
approach yeah well i love what you guys

1816
