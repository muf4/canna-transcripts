1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:06,240
so what you've got Anatomy right here on

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:09,359
this apple if you can make anything

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:13,000
out is this is this is the buds scale

4
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:15,679
scars from last year so it has grown

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,439
this much all the way to the end this

6
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:21,960
year the farther it gets away from the

7
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,240
farther the apical marem gets away from

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,960
last year's growth last year's growth

9
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:29,559
starts to grow Spurs and that's how you

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,759
encourage Spurs on apple trees is

11
00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:34,640
letting the apical marasim get away get

12
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,480
farther away and so these are all fruit

13
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,480
Spurs right here right here and so this

14
00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:42,000
tree will grow fruit Spurs and so next

15
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:44,398
year this will have fruit on these spurs

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,079
because a Spur by definition is a

17
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,039
shorten compressed stem and it's really

18
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:51,920
built for fruit production and built for

19
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:54,760
fruit weight and the mistake people make

20
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,960
is they see this big Chute coming they

21
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:58,839
pit they cut it here by cutting it here

22
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,239
it removes the apical dominance and

23
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,399
these guys say oh look we're going to

24
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:04,118
sprout we're going to sprout we're going

25
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:06,960
to sprout well once it sprouts you don't

26
00:01:04,118 --> 00:01:10,118
get any Spurs so the way to encourage

27
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:13,000
spur production in fruit trees is to let

28
00:01:10,118 --> 00:01:15,438
it grow because once a Spur once it

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,040
forms a Spur it always has that spur so

30
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:19,199
now I could go back and I could cut it

31
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,680
to here and these spurs would not turn

32
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,200
into vegetative shoots they would stay a

33
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,880
spur and you would have spur growth

34
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,079
you'd have stocky growth and it would

35
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:30,118
support that and you get away from this

36
00:01:28,078 --> 00:01:31,959
type of growth see what should have have

37
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:34,280
happened here or what will happen here

38
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:36,759
eventually I should have thinned these

39
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:39,040
but also these will be cut back so that

40
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:41,478
this can be strong enough to hold all of

41
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:45,560
Weight like this and not let it continue

42
00:01:41,478 --> 00:01:45,560
to hang down like that
