organics this is the podcast where we

6
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:29,039
discuss the cutting edge of growing from

7
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:30,799
a science-based perspective

8
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,160
and drawn top experts from around the

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,119
industry to share their wisdom and

in this podcast i caught up with brian

12
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,640
anderson to talk about cultivation

13
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,320
through the eyes of an architect

14
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,000
how do we design our facilities to be

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,679
compliant with local laws

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,039
how can we be more efficient in our

17
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:46,719
designs and layouts

18
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,800
how does the methodology of different

19
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,359
grow styles impact your design

20
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:52,799
brian covers all this and much more

21
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:54,558

photo x this past year it's uh it's a

54
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:57,840
little crazy to think about

55
00:01:56,718 --> 00:01:59,519
how we used to get together for

56
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,040
conferences right now with this uh

57
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:03,280

00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,040
but uh i wanted to i want i really

59
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,439
enjoyed chatting with you and

60
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,280
i i wanted to talk to you about this

61
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:10,000
sort of architecture perspective that

62
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,800
you have

63
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,159
on cultivation can we start off just

64
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,120
giving listeners a little bit of your

65
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:20,560
background and talking about who you are

66
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,080
yeah sure so um i'm in arlington

67
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,598
massachusetts suburb of

68
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,760
cambridge in boston and we

69
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:29,598
so i'm a architect and principal of

70
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:32,719
anderson porter design we've been

71
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:35,598
been an architect for 26 years

72
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:36,000
and 20 of those years really as a

73
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:39,439
general

74
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,120
practitioner if you will and

75
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:44,159
it was sort of in that mix of projects

76
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:49,439
that we'd done

77
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:51,359
that things came together back in 2014

78
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:53,280
you know they say that luck is the

79
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,080
intersection of

80
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:59,199
preparedness and opportunity so um that

81
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,480
opportunity came for us in 2014 and the

82
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:02,799
preparedness was

83
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:04,719
just that very specific things in our

84
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:08,879
background as architects that we had

85
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:10,560
that we had done uh we had been um

86
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:12,239
you know we're in eastern massachusetts

87
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,840
and a lot of around us

88
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:18,080
is uh biotech biopharm uh and the like

89
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,519
and medical device manufacturing so

90
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,440
we have done a lot of work in medical

91
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,039
device manufacturing and those are clean

92
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:25,120
room environments

93
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:28,079
those are staff that wear tyvek suits

94
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,480
and hair nets and beard nets

95
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,360
so that really lined up in the cannabis

96
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:34,798
space

97
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,720
we had been the architects for the

98
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,519
federal reserve bank of boston

99
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:41,759
which is a pretty big role to play from

100
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,879
1999 to 2006

101
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:47,840
and so if you remember 2000 you know

102
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:48,959
september 11 2001 happened right in

103
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,080
there so we had a

104
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:54,799
very deep background in both physical

105
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:57,439
and electronic security as it relates to

106
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,560
facilities and so in 2014 a lot of folks

107
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:00,719
coming

108
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,000
to us had you know never spoken to the

109
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:03,519
chief of police before

110
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,759
let alone the fire marshal those have

111
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,599
been people traditionally to be avoided

112
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:09,518
uh we came along and we were somebody

113
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:12,719
who could speak to their language

114
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:16,239
um and we also spoke the language of

115
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:16,238
biopharm and clean rooms

116
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:22,240
and we had a background in retail

117
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:24,079
so we actually practice in a lot of

118
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,040
retail working cannabis as well

119
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:28,079
so since 2014 that has now taken off we

120
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,800
had our first

121
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:32,639
group here in massachusetts we now work

122
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,319
we opened up a virtual office

123
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,240
in in orange county fullerton california

124
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:40,959
this year in 2020

125
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,160
we do projects in central europe north

126
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:43,918
macedonia

127
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,439
uh as well as uh throughout the united

128
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:47,599
states

129
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:49,439
wow that's that's great and i i really

130
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,600
enjoyed chatting with you because

131
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:53,439
you had a totally different perspective

132
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,479
on cultivation than i did

133
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:59,040
my focus has always been on

134
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:00,959
you know primarily on soil soil biology

135
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,800
and and that aspect of cultivation but

136
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:07,439
you really came at it from sort of

137
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:10,400
a regulatory uh perspective a structural

138
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:10,959
and uh workflow perspective that i

139
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:13,679
thought was

140
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:14,959
it was sort of unique um can you talk a

141
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,038
little bit about sort of

142
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:18,879
what an architect's perspective is

143
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:20,959
regarding a facility

144
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:21,918
like what do you where do you start the

145
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:23,359
conversation

146
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:25,038
when you talk to a grower because as a

147
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,560
grower a lot of times you're coming from

148
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:28,879
a background like mine you don't really

149
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,800
think about these sorts of things in

150
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:33,519
detail

151
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,400
you know it's it's funny what i'll

152
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:35,198
answer it and

153
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:37,519
it's i think it's important to

154
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,680
understand that this is not necessarily

155
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:42,719
an architect's point of view

156
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,720
mine comes from in addition to what i

157
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,080
sort of described there quickly as my

158
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,600
background

159
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:51,839
when i talk to growers about how their

160
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,720
how to approach the grow it comes from a

161
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:57,038
knowledge

162
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:58,479
in lean manufacturing we do a lot in

163
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:02,000
in our work i didn't mention that

164
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:05,519
earlier but it influences how we look at

165
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,800
cultivation from a workflow and work

166
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:11,918
practice perspective um

167
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,439
as well as so in lean if you know lean

168
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:16,318
in manufacturing and lean

169
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:18,800
in enterprise i.e business it's about

170
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:22,400
organizing things to eliminate waste

171
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:24,639
and so we look at cultivation facilities

172
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:26,799
in in manufacturing facilities

173
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,000
uh for weed you know manufacturing is

174
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:33,199
anything from

175
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:36,240
pills to vape cartridges to to pre-rolls

176
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,120
as a if there's an efficient flow to the

177
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,240
work

178
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,280
and so we we line up the steps that you

179
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,519
take

180
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:45,599
uh by interviewing right so we interview

181
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:47,680
the grower to understand how they grow

182
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,599
what's important what soil media they

183
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,800
use cocoa versus

184
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:53,519
versus rock wool versus living soil and

185
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,560
then begin

186
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:59,758
to arrange this the spaces needed for

187
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,839
people to do work so everything from

188
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,439
you know let's arrange the shipping bay

189
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:05,359
and the receiving bank so that we have a

190
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:07,439
quarantine space

191
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,479
everybody today you know due to covid we

192
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:10,079
all sort of understand

193
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:11,598
quarantine in a new way and how

194
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:14,079
important that is

195
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:14,879
you don't want to bring in some

196
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:18,879
distributors

197
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:22,159
junk and you know beetle encased in a

198
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:24,639
wooden pallet into your into your grow

199
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,439
and so you know we we're so we're

200
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,478
thinking about

201
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:31,038
factors that are related to the grow

202
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:32,240
but that affect work and reflect affect

203
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:35,680
the health

204
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,519
and maintenance and safety ultimately

205
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,918
of how to protect how to protect the

206
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:43,038
plant so we're kind of weaving in

207
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:46,240
things that we learned from from lean

208
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:47,759
and efficiency in work process to the

209
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,519
physical things like

210
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,879
how to build a quarantine room so that

211
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:52,878
you can push things

212
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:55,360
effectively in from the shipping bay the

213
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,000
dirty side and pull things out from the

214
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,520
clean

215
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,360
let's say your harvest corridor is a

216
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:01,439
clean corridor where people are

217
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,879
observing you know good manufacturing

218
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,598
practices and good agricultural

219
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,680
practices

220
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:07,199
so they've already been through a uh a

221
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,120
you know the workforce comes in through

222
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,919
an air an air pressure zone or

223
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,840
you know an air lock and they may have

224
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:16,240
you know gowned up in a tyvek suit

225
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:17,279
and so that those two worlds kind of

226
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,240
don't overlap

227
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:21,839
that they're always separated that's one

228
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,840
way

229
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:26,000
that we look at breaking down the work

230
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:27,279
into its parts

231
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,680
yeah i'm really glad you brought up a

232
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:31,598
quarantine space that was something that

233
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,959
i was hoping you would address

234
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:35,038
i think it's one of those things that

235
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:37,199
sometimes gets overlooked in facilities

236
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:37,679
or when people try to adapt buildings

237
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,278
that weren't

238
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,559
originally designed i mean if you're

239
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:42,799
building from the ground up it's pretty

240
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:44,958
easy but if you're having to come into a

241
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:46,799
space that's already been

242
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:48,399
already been built that is a challenge

243
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:49,039
but i can't agree with you more that

244
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,919
that's such an

245
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:52,958
important aspect of it and then when you

246
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:55,599
talk about lean

247
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:56,239
um interestingly enough i've had a

248
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,159
gentleman

249
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,360
uh ben hartman on the podcast talking

250
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:02,399
about the lean farm

251
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,159
kind of looking at outdoor farming

252
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,600
uh from a lean perspective which was a

253
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:08,480
big

254
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,959
mental gap for me versus you know this

255
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,399
this

256
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:14,000
more facility-based manufacturing

257
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,519
perspective

258
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,278
and there's really a balance in there

259
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,399
but a lot of growers don't think about

260
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:20,480
the fact that uh

261
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,759
you know when you're growing by yourself

262
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,600
on a medical side with

263
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:26,799
25 lights maybe you and one other person

264
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,959
you don't really need to think about

265
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:30,559
your workflow as much but when you try

266
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:33,919
and expand that to 10

267
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:35,518
15 20 times that size workflow

268
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:37,120
the number of steps you take in the day

269
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,360
the number of

270
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,120
uh times you have to handle a particular

271
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,440
material that waste adds up

272
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,560
really really fast and takes up a lot of

273
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,279
time

274
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:49,119
oh yeah that's a really good point yep

275
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:51,200
yeah anybody's ever been a grunt

276
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,240
on a on a construction site or anybody

277
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,360
who's ever been a grunt

278
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:57,120
in a in a in a farming

279
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,039
environment knows that you know your

280
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,879
boss says pick that pile up

281
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:02,480
and move it over there and then after

282
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:03,519
lunch you're told pick that pile up and

283
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,519
move it over there

284
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,959
right and if you've ever been in that

285
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:10,000
situation that's

286
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:11,759
completely not lean right moving things

287
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,039
once knowing you know never setting

288
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:15,360
something down on the floor

289
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:17,360
is a really good thing to think about

290
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,360
wow right think about an organized

291
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,200
workspace where nothing ever gets set

292
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,519
down on the floor because that's just

293
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,200
time time to set it down time to move

294
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,799
around it pick it back up

295
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,040
if we can eliminate that think about how

296
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:30,559
many more transplants you could do right

297
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:32,159
how does it how much time does it take

298
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:34,239
to take a clipping

299
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:35,278
from a mom and put it into an easy clone

300
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,200
machine right how

301
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:38,639
how quickly can you do that and if

302
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,120
you're in if you're growing

303
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:41,838
25 plants it's no big deal you don't

304
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,799
think about it

305
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,680
but if you've got you know 100 000

306
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:47,679
plants

307
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:49,120
and you you just you know one crew just

308
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:50,879
broke down a room and harvested it and

309
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,639
your job is to populate it now in the

310
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:53,600
same day so time doesn't slip on the

311
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:55,759
schedule

312
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,159
how much time does it take to put you

313
00:10:55,759 --> 00:11:00,879
know 1500 clones in an easy cloner

314
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:02,319
and move the you know you know the ready

315
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:03,759
ones out

316
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:07,278
all that takes time and so you want to

317
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:09,838
eliminate wasted steps

318
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:11,360
yeah one of the uh examples that ben

319
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,279
gives when he gives this talk

320
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,639
to a smaller audience is he'll he'll

321
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:16,320
bring a bunch of envelopes

322
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:18,319
and he'll have people come up front and

323
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,480
he'll have one group

324
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,600
do the envelopes like putting a stamp on

325
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,399
them sealing them

326
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,000
putting the letter in uh yeah all all

327
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,440
without setting down the envelope go

328
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
through all the steps at once and then

329
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,279
the other group

330
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,720
will do the whole thing well they'll

331
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:32,399
they'll stuff the envelope and they'll

332
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,000
still stuff 50 envelopes and then

333
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,679
they'll go back and they'll

334
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,200
lick and close 50 envelopes and then

335
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:39,278
they'll add the stamp

336
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,278
and you would think that doing the same

337
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:43,278
motion over and over again

338
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:44,399
uh you know like the the second option

339
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:46,879
there of of doing

340
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,919
all 50 stuffing at once would be faster

341
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:49,360
but it's actually

342
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:51,519
takes so much longer because you're

343
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,759
having to retouch and set down

344
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,360
these envelopes so many times it's a

345
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:56,799
really cool thought experiment that you

346
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,120
anyone can try at home kind of thing

347
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:03,439
that's it's kind of fun

348
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:06,799
there are so many of those um um

349
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:08,320
in many ways we call them design games

350
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:10,479
they're they're they're sort of

351
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,760
interactive

352
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:16,240
games that use game theory to teach

353
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:17,120
fundamental lessons and so yeah i'm

354
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,480
involved

355
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,240
in doing a lot of those teaching

356
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,639
exercises for lean

357
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,720
we have one called the airplane game and

358
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,120
you have a team with legos to assemble

359
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,560
this

360
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,560
airplane you're told exactly how many

361
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:31,359
legos to use and

362
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:32,559
the rules set it up so that it's very

363
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,278
similar to the envelope

364
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:36,879
stuffing game which teaches that lesson

365
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:38,000
that the fewer times you pick something

366
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:39,759
up and put it down

367
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
and the better the communication amongst

368
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:43,679
the team that's doing something

369
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,200
you can eliminate enormous amounts of

370
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:46,958
time and it's not always

371
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,399
intuitive many many times it's

372
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:51,679
counterintuitive you don't think

373
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:53,839
you think right if you rely on your gut

374
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:55,359
we often get things wrong in terms of

375
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,959
thinking about what takes the most time

376
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,560
versus what would be a shorter way to do

377
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:00,078
it

378
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:01,599
yeah and when you say time we're not

379
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:04,000
talking about rushing or

380
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,278
moving faster necessarily than the other

381
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,958
group we're talking about just

382
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:08,639
moving more efficiently and i think

383
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:10,638
that's important it's not about

384
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,320
speeding up the employee it's just about

385
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,079
making the steps that they're having to

386
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:17,278
take

387
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:19,199
take less time that's right and that

388
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:19,759
comes up so in facility design around

389
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,040
around

390
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:23,039
you know grow facilities

391
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,839
breaking it down all the way to its

392
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,959
parts i know that

393
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,959
many people will

394
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:37,360
feel forced to accept

395
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,839
things that you may actually be able to

396
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,919
change

397
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:42,000
i mean those those could be things like

398
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:43,120
walls right many people don't think to

399
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,879
move the wall

400
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,320
right but when you think about the

401
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:48,240
amount of money that's being spent and

402
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,079
the amount of money at stake

403
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,278
moving and rearranging walls within a

404
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:53,278
building can

405
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:55,039
improve workflow right many times we

406
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:56,399
accept the way things are like well this

407
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:58,799
building only has

408
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,399
600 amps right i could really use 1200

409
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:02,879
amps but it only has 600 so i'm only

410
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,320
going to make my grow fit

411
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:06,240
uh many times those have to do with

412
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,600
money right all these everything's

413
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:11,120
impacted by money

414
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,519
but a lot of the work of architecture is

415
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,278
to

416
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,560
break down a lot of things that are

417
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:17,919
assumed

418
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:20,799
and um challenging those assumptions

419
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:21,838
so that we can change things and adapt

420
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:25,359
them so that

421
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:28,240
ultimately the finished product works in

422
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,519
the most effective and efficient manner

423
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,079
yeah someone asked so what are some of

424
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:35,039
the common pitfalls that you see

425
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:35,679
when uh coming onto a project like this

426
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:38,000
from a

427
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:39,519
from your perspective i mean you already

428
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,519
mentioned one of

429
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:43,039
as a grower feeling limited by the

430
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,799
structure in front of you that may

431
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:46,480
actually be adaptable

432
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:48,879
if you can kind of step out of that box

433
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:52,079
but what other things might you see

434
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:54,000
in terms of in terms of that perspective

435
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:55,519
um yeah you mentioned it earlier which

436
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,799
is this idea of

437
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,759
understanding regulations so as an

438
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:03,120
architect

439
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:05,439
we're trained to look at things from

440
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,480
the point of view of who's regulating it

441
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,800
right so

442
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,680
osha for example the occupational safety

443
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:11,759
and hazard

444
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:14,078
uh you know of workers protecting worker

445
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:16,559
safety so we look at osha we look at

446
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:18,078
building codes you know establishing how

447
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:18,559
to get out of a you know building the

448
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:21,838
most

449
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:24,000
quickly right so we look at um

450
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,440
in case of a fire so so we think we look

451
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,958
at things through the eyes of the fire

452
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,160
marshal or we look at things through the

453
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:30,479
eyes of a

454
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:31,600
of a of our state regulator like the

455
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,199
cannabis regulating

456
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,879
regulator in each state is going to want

457
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:37,120
to see certain things

458
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:38,720
and so we start from we start from that

459
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:43,039
because we know that that's an absolute

460
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:44,639
if we don't pass that that inspection

461
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:46,559
it was all for naught right so we have

462
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,159
to do that so we take those and we order

463
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:51,758
things around

464
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:54,319
life safety right and then health

465
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,120
so that has to do with choosing of wall

466
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,959
materials

467
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,399
so that they comply with you know being

468
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:00,479
able to be wiped down

469
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,480
we talk about aseptic conditions right

470
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,240
floor materials wall materials

471
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,560
ceilings making sure that we can put

472
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,799
ceilings in so that because if you know

473
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:11,198
how impossible it is to clean around

474
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:12,319
ductwork right so you don't want a messy

475
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:17,120
you know all that

476
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:20,480
duct and junk up above your plants um

477
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,360
and so what else if we think about it in

478
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,039
terms of you know where

479
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,959
sprinkler heads all that sort of stuff

480
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:27,120
right so how do we mix

481
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:29,518
the life safety from the systems to the

482
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:33,039
life safety from the building materials

483
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:36,159
um and then flow of work

484
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:38,879
uh you know ordering the the

485
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:40,559
group you know so ordering this the

486
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:41,439
number of rooms grow rooms how many

487
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:43,198
should there be

488
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,880
that's where we work very very closely

489
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:45,599
with growers to establish their grow

490
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:47,600
pattern

491
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,800
um because that has to do with the

492
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,120
fundamental units

493
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:51,919
of work how many you know how many clone

494
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,198
rooms

495
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:57,599
how many veg rooms how many mom rooms

496
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:59,120
um you know thinking about well is it is

497
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,879
it really just one or should we make it

498
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,720
two so what happens if something happens

499
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:04,400
to your mom's right and you need to

500
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,759
clean that room out what do you do when

501
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,120
you're cleaning out your mom room right

502
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:10,640
you need another one

503
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:12,479
for the overflow to

504
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,919
you know making sure that the bedroom is

505
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,759
is is sized

506
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,959
properly to handle the number of

507
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:20,879
throughput for your final flower count

508
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,120
to establishing exactly the right room

509
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,520
dimensions uh for the flower rooms you

510
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,438
know

511
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:26,639
how based on number of lights or based

512
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,759
on whether you're

513
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:31,759
using uh tiered you know pip

514
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:33,200
racked pip style you know movable

515
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,919
benches or whether you're using a flat

516
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,319
ggs

517
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:38,480
roll top all of those things have

518
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:40,480
dimensional requirements

519
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:43,440
right down to door sizes i don't know

520
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:47,120
what to say is the most

521
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:50,160
what comes into play the most common but

522
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:52,639
i don't know it's fun having

523
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,480
it's for me professionally it's very fun

524
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,200
having a certain set of skills that i

525
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,440
learned

526
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,440
as an architect and finding them really

527
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,120
really adaptable to

528
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,960
you know when talking to growers right

529
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:04,879
and and thinking about gee you know

530
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,640
let's make this door 42 inches wide

531
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,559
instead of 36 you know it would be

532
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,320
easier to get a cart through it

533
00:18:08,558 --> 00:18:12,480
and it's and the response is like oh

534
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:13,279
yeah you know like we can do that right

535
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,960
we don't have to

536
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:17,440
bang our knuckles on the door jams every

537
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,960
time we're pushing a cart throw

538
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,600
so it's sometimes it's really simple

539
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:24,640
things like that um

540
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:27,119
to where to put an rfid you know batch

541
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,160
reader or how to work with and how to

542
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:30,719
integrate

543
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:33,038
data collection so that a grow could you

544
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,038
know accelerate through

545
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:37,919
through big data essentially through

546
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:39,440
data collection and machine learning

547
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,360
you know everything from the tech side

548
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,919
to the sort of fundamental or you know

549
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:45,279
concrete side of how wide to make a door

550
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,520
um it's hard to say which

551
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:48,798
which which precedes the other but

552
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:51,038
putting them in all in order is a lot of

553
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:51,038
fun

554
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,798
yeah that's that's one thing we've

555
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,558
thought about with the type of

556
00:18:54,798 --> 00:18:58,160
growing that we do is have if you're

557
00:18:56,558 --> 00:18:59,678
growing in a bed

558
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,480
if you do need to remove a bed from a

559
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:04,400
room and it fits nicely on a pallet

560
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,400
how do do we have a door frame that

561
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,320
allows us to move the pallet

562
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,679
in and out with a pallet jack which is

563
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:11,119
saves a ton of time you don't want to

564
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,679
get to the door and then have to shovel

565
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:14,159
it

566
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:15,200
you know through that door space so

567
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,558
that's that's a really important

568
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,720
consideration

569
00:19:16,558 --> 00:19:20,319
are you are you finding though that

570
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,880
regulations always

571
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:25,200
line up with optimal cultivation

572
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,840
practices do you have any good example

573
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,120
of

574
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:31,918
a time when regulation kind of

575
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:33,918
limited the ability of a cultivation

576
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:36,960
facility or a grower to really

577
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,960
do what they want to do

578
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:41,918
i'll point to a recent one i think the

579
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:45,759
state of illinois has stepped in it

580
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:48,080
in a bad way when they outlawed

581
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:50,480
outdoor growing right the state of

582
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:54,000
illinois and their latest

583
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:55,599
issue has made it not possible for

584
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,079
farmers to grow cannabis

585
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:59,678
outdoor in the state of illinois think

586
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:01,599
about what that does from a

587
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:03,200
just from a carbon perspective right

588
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:04,558
that means that all cannabis grown in

589
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,038
the state of illinois has to be grown

590
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:07,599
indoor

591
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:10,400
under lights or in a closed greenhouse

592
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:10,399
with a mixed light

593
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,360
right it would be very efficient to grow

594
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:17,200
outdoors like soybean growers and corn

595
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:19,678
growers in illinois

596
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,400
aren't complaining about the dli and the

597
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,240
weather

598
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,519
they're doing just fine so why wouldn't

599
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,240
cannabis be allowed to grow

600
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:28,079
outdoors so i do think that state law

601
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,599
affects in a big way

602
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:31,599
what we do as an industry and what we're

603
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:33,439
able to do as an industry so

604
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:35,119
i'm gonna you know make an easy

605
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,480
prediction that a lot more carbon is

606
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:39,119
going to be consumed

607
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,679
in illinois with you know light fixtures

608
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:44,479
and construction and all the things

609
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,200
uh that you know if your grow plan is to

610
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,480
produce

611
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:51,038
you know um for a

612
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,558
broad spectrum distillate and you're

613
00:20:51,038 --> 00:20:54,400
gonna be you know extracting

614
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:57,200
everything then outdoor would be a you

615
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,759
know great way to do that and save

616
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:02,640
and save costs and save energy costs but

617
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:06,158
the state of illinois has outlawed that

618
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:08,400
that's one example um

619
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:10,640
another maybe that you know the the one

620
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,159
that gets a lot of press is that 36 watt

621
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,159
per square foot and that came out of the

622
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:16,400
massachusetts regulation so my home

623
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,400
state

624
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,480
and the jury's out as to whether it its

625
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,798
intent is clear

626
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,919
its intent was to limit high pressure

627
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:25,440
sodium lamps

628
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:27,120
right the use of high pressures it was

629
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:30,080
to limit the use of high pressure sodium

630
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:31,918
hbs double ended hps

631
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:33,199
and that you know puts a cramp in a lot

632
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:35,440
of people's

633
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:38,640
style that i mean if your knowledge base

634
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:41,279
entirely was based on growing under hps

635
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:44,960
then that requirement is going to seem

636
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:46,879
completely foreign um it

637
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,319
does allow for it it does not

638
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,960
technically disallow

639
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:53,200
high pressure sodium but if it spreads

640
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,038
the if it spreads the lights out too far

641
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,120
if a five and a half foot grid is just

642
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:58,640
not acceptable it has to be a you know

643
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:01,038
four by four and a half

644
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,919
that may exceed the the lighting power

645
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:03,519
density

646
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,520
um but there's other things that can be

647
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:06,319
done and there's there are ways in which

648
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:10,960
that

649
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:10,960
can be um utilized

650
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:14,558
but that all i don't know if you know

651
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:16,639
it's a deep deep rabbit hole to get into

652
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:17,359
is the differences between led and hps

653
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,400
but

654
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:23,279
um that's one area in which the law is

655
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:25,519
trying to mess around and has a lot of

656
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:27,839
growers twisted around the axle

657
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:30,000
yeah i think it's uh it also raises your

658
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:31,279
cost potentially too as traditionally

659
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,919
led lights are going to

660
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:35,119
be more expensive than that's right

661
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:37,679
double end hps and

662
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:39,599
there's such a range of quality in the

663
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:42,320
led market

664
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:44,079
right now it's gotten a lot better but i

665
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:46,240
i do know that people have made

666
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:47,359
poor lighting decisions for an entire

667
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,079
facility and

668
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:51,599
come to regret it which actually brings

669
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:53,678
me to another point that you brought up

670
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:57,199
in our in our email exchange

671
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:59,519
which was uh around the idea of growers

672
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,960
picking a path and sort of sticking to

673
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:04,480
it can you kind of

674
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:08,159
liberate elaborate on that um

675
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:11,279
and kind of what you meant yeah sure so

676
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:14,640
um yeah one role one role that i play

677
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:18,319
often with uh groups

678
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,880
um is trying to avoid uh going to trade

679
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:20,480
shows

680
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,000
and falling in love with the newest

681
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,319
shiniest object right

682
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,759
there's there are in the past six years

683
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:27,359
it seems like every three months a new

684
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:28,400
piece of equipment comes out comes to

685
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:31,839
market

686
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:34,000
and that can be really distracting

687
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:36,079
so the newest shiniest object you know

688
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,599
comes out of the trade show

689
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:41,119
and we have spent an inordinate amount

690
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:43,278
of time

691
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:44,479
researching that newest thing and really

692
00:23:43,278 --> 00:23:47,679
chasing it to ground

693
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:49,038
to find out only to find out it may not

694
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:51,840
even be ul listed

695
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:54,158
right or it doesn't have certain you

696
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:57,519
know it's not listed on the dli

697
00:23:54,159 --> 00:24:00,880
index of approved lighting or it's right

698
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:04,558
um that

699
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:06,960
following really um

700
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:08,000
how do i put this like sticking to

701
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,079
traditional grows

702
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,119
and not venturing out into new

703
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:14,639
technologies

704
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:18,000
is usually a wise decision right um

705
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:21,520
growing to getting to scale on

706
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,919
with with with um achievable

707
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:26,240
means is is important as opposed to

708
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:28,799
trusting in one piece of technology

709
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,278
uh as a as a as a as a solution i don't

710
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:31,519
know if that's

711
00:24:29,278 --> 00:24:33,679
quite answered your question yeah i get

712
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:36,240
i get what you're saying i mean

713
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:37,519
in my experience the cannabis industry

714
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,558
has some of the

715
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:43,918
uh some of the best

716
00:24:40,558 --> 00:24:45,359
uh marketers and uh

717
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,360
i guess i would almost say like snake

718
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:48,319
oil salesman when it comes to promoting

719
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:50,959
a product

720
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:51,839
uh yeah and and a lot of times you'll

721
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,240
find that these

722
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:56,079
products are unproven they don't have

723
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,278
the science to back them up and like you

724
00:24:56,079 --> 00:25:00,480
mentioned they may not even mate

725
00:24:57,278 --> 00:25:02,720
regulatory uh requirements and so

726
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,400
you will find a grower that will go and

727
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,600
that's building a facility we'll go and

728
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,679
see something

729
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:10,000
and we've been i don't know lights are

730
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:12,798
probably the easiest example of this

731
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,640
but uh the idea of scaling a facility

732
00:25:12,798 --> 00:25:16,000
and making such a large investment in an

733
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,960
unproven technology

734
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,558
is i think really really challenging

735
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,440
even when they give it to you at a

736
00:25:20,558 --> 00:25:24,879
discount which i see that happen quite a

737
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,480
bit with these facilities too is they're

738
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,240
like well this one company is going to

739
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,319
give me a pretty good deal on on these

740
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:33,359
lights or on this technology

741
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:34,000
i'm going to give it a shot uh it's it's

742
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:37,038
risky

743
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:40,159
like you said it's very risky

744
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:42,000
so one of those yeah so i've been there

745
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:43,760
are there's an there's a a

746
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,119
new game in town in the past couple of

747
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:48,319
years which is

748
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:49,359
um foreign investors who have set up

749
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:52,558
companies

750
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:54,240
in the u.s and the the hook

751
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:55,839
that you call it that the snake oil

752
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,519
salesman uses is oh we're going to

753
00:25:55,839 --> 00:25:59,599
finance this for you

754
00:25:57,519 --> 00:26:01,200
right because they know that getting

755
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:02,879
finance for this facility is the

756
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,240
is one of the main hurdles to getting

757
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,600
open and if

758
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,278
and if a salesman comes along and says

759
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:09,359
hey we've got this new technology

760
00:26:07,278 --> 00:26:12,319
and we're going to finance it for you it

761
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:14,879
becomes really easy trap to fall into

762
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:16,639
and that's a that's something to be to

763
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,400
be very wary of

764
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,159
um there are groups out there that are

765
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,480
making their products

766
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:25,278
seem like they've solved everything but

767
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:27,200
when you get under the hood you realize

768
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:28,798
oh you can never change out the lights

769
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,319
what if that light isn't really what you

770
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:32,000
want

771
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:34,000
can't change it right because it's part

772
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,759
of a part of a machine that you bought

773
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,240
that's you know designed to grow eat for

774
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:39,119
you

775
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,519
and it's all automated and it's all

776
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:42,079
built

777
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:43,519
into the box and you can't change it so

778
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:45,678
yeah there's a lot of

779
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:46,879
um there's a lot of things coming to

780
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:49,038
market that need to be

781
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,880
that need to be investigated so i yeah i

782
00:26:49,038 --> 00:26:53,599
repeat that don't

783
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:55,360
invest a massive amount of money and

784
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:58,639
hinge your success on an

785
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:59,359
unproven technology yeah now i do like

786
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,440
the idea

787
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:02,479
if there's room in the facility to have

788
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,120
sort of an r

789
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,880
d space that allows you to trial

790
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:07,599
different things that may or may not be

791
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,159
improvements

792
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:11,119
on your current facility structure i

793
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:13,200
don't know if that's something that

794
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:14,319
you're able to design into

795
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,038
many of the buildings that you're

796
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:20,000
working on i put that into the

797
00:27:17,038 --> 00:27:21,038
best in class category if we have space

798
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,240
if we have a

799
00:27:21,038 --> 00:27:25,919
a client with a grow team who

800
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,480
acknowledges the need for r

801
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:30,399
d that for me is are some of the are the

802
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,679
best facilities we've designed and i'll

803
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:34,959
tell you why

804
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:36,000
so um let's say that you've represented

805
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,399
to your investors

806
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,679
what your yield is going to be right

807
00:27:38,398 --> 00:27:40,798
based on the number of plants and the

808
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:42,559
strains

809
00:27:40,798 --> 00:27:45,278
and and all and your narratives your

810
00:27:42,558 --> 00:27:47,519
grow grow grow narratives

811
00:27:45,278 --> 00:27:48,319
if you then can have can afford the

812
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:51,440
space

813
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:53,759
to have two or three rooms set aside

814
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,440
you can call them r d rooms you're going

815
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:56,240
to do a couple of things for that grow

816
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,919
facility

817
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,759
you're going to give your grower and

818
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:00,720
your organization the ability to test

819
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:04,319
new strains

820
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:06,720
bring new products to market um

821
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:07,918
investigate and fool around in a in a

822
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,960
positive way

823
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:12,000
that's not detracting from your yields

824
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:16,000
that your that your

825
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,440
investors are counting on number two and

826
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,159
this is the the hidden

827
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,278
benefit of having an r d space is that

828
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:24,480
becomes

829
00:28:21,278 --> 00:28:26,319
a relief valve a kind of sacrificial

830
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,000
space if something goes wrong in your

831
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:30,798
general population

832
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,159
you could evacuate a room and move it

833
00:28:30,798 --> 00:28:34,639
into one of those r d

834
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,679
spaces sacrificing everything in there

835
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,720
right throwing that

836
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:41,200
out to save what is your

837
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,759
you know your core crop that that that

838
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,399
harvest

839
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:45,919
right that's a thing that that might not

840
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:47,599
be thought about in the first order but

841
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:48,880
it comes into play

842
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:51,359
more often than not right how many

843
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:53,840
people had something go wrong

844
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:55,439
but you've got nowhere to put it right

845
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:57,038
if you could if you could just empty out

846
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:00,399
that room and actually put it in

847
00:28:57,038 --> 00:29:02,798
a vacant room you'd save the crop

848
00:29:00,398 --> 00:29:03,918
and that's why i think having an r d

849
00:29:02,798 --> 00:29:04,960
space

850
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:07,759
even though you may not want to

851
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:10,840
sacrifice it in a pinch you could

852
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:12,158
and that's that's one of those hidden

853
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:13,678
benefits

854
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:15,200
yeah i know from working closely with

855
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:16,640
gold leaf they have

856
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,038
five or six flower rooms i can't

857
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:21,440
remember offhand and they're all

858
00:29:19,038 --> 00:29:22,960
essentially identical and while they

859
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,679
don't have a dedicated

860
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:28,079
uh r d space based on the limitations of

861
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:31,919
the facility and their production needs

862
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:34,720
they are able to do research in a given

863
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:36,960
in a given room every cycle looking at

864
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,558
ways of being innovative so

865
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,079
testing out a different irrigation

866
00:29:38,558 --> 00:29:41,759
system in this case looking at

867
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:43,839
blue mats versus the way they were hand

868
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:46,640
watering allowed them to see

869
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:49,359
an roi that their return on investment

870
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:51,520
by switching the whole facility over

871
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:53,199
was going to save them you know

872
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:55,038
thousands of dollars in labor

873
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,720
uh over the course of whatever given

874
00:29:55,038 --> 00:29:59,119
period they established is

875
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,880
for their roi or you know making a

876
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:01,839
lighting change in one room allows them

877
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,360
to decide

878
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:05,918
if that lighting change should be made

879
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:08,479
across the entire facility

880
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:09,360
without risking your entire crop and

881
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:13,120
without

882
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:15,439
risking you know too much of your

883
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:17,599
of your profits uh at the end of the day

884
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,480
to make a change and i love that idea

885
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:21,038
because

886
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:23,360
to commit fully to a new technology or a

887
00:30:21,038 --> 00:30:23,839
new innovation or even a new workflow i

888
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:27,278
think

889
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:29,119
is is risky without some research some

890
00:30:27,278 --> 00:30:30,640
actual data to back up and support what

891
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:33,038
you're doing

892
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,679
that's right that's right and that's you

893
00:30:33,038 --> 00:30:35,278
know i

894
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:38,159
from from a lighting perspective it's

895
00:30:35,278 --> 00:30:40,079
also important to to realize that

896
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:41,360
your mechanical systems that are

897
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:43,278
balancing your

898
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:44,719
relative humidity temperature and vapor

899
00:30:43,278 --> 00:30:46,798
pressure deficit

900
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,640
are really balanced based on the heat

901
00:30:46,798 --> 00:30:52,960
output and many of those

902
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:55,120
set points for hps don't work for led

903
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,679
so there has to be so whenever those

904
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:59,038
changes are made or if those changes are

905
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:00,720
anticipated

906
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:03,278
it must be understood that the set

907
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:05,919
points on the mechanical systems

908
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:07,599
have to be adapted otherwise the room is

909
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:10,080
going to behave entirely

910
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:12,240
the wrong way under the new light under

911
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:14,398
under a new light choice

912
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,880
sure now if if you're going from let's

913
00:31:14,398 --> 00:31:18,879
just say from double ended hbs to led

914
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:21,120
wouldn't you essentially have over built

915
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:23,840
your facility so your set points

916
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:24,719
would drop but you could still use the

917
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:26,879
equipment

918
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,240
that you had in place it's just more

919
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,799
than you would need i would i would

920
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,839
think or

921
00:31:28,798 --> 00:31:34,798
or do you have a different experience or

922
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:36,639
i'll just say that each case is unique

923
00:31:34,798 --> 00:31:38,398
in some ways you've over built

924
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,399
but in some ways it's an entirely new

925
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:41,678
animal it's not just that you're dialing

926
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:44,959
it back

927
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:47,038
it's that your your sensible loads and

928
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,720
your latent loads may have changed

929
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:50,240
dramatically and so when you think about

930
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,600
leaf temperature

931
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,278
right in those two different

932
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:55,599
environments you

933
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:56,880
really need to balance that with a um

934
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:59,119
and this is where i don't want to

935
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,080
overstep my professional limits i'm not

936
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:02,558
a professional engineer

937
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:04,720
i do know that leaf temperature and set

938
00:32:02,558 --> 00:32:05,678
points make a huge difference in in crop

939
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,519
performance

940
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:09,759
and that it's a delicate balance when

941
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:13,359
you're talking about the performance of

942
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:16,480
the systems that maintain that so

943
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:19,038
um it's not always as easy as just

944
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:21,038
resetting the the the automation system

945
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:22,640
or whatever's contr your controllers

946
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:23,839
that are controlling those the

947
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,480
temperature and relative humidity

948
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:26,558
sometimes it

949
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,720
needs to look at how well it's

950
00:32:26,558 --> 00:32:31,519
dehumidifying and testing that

951
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:33,919
to be assured that all the parts are

952
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:36,240
working together

953
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:38,000
now when you talk about changes in

954
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,200
technology like like lighting for

955
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,319
example

956
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,240
one of the other things that we

957
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:45,359
discussed with some of these new

958
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:47,599
uh styles of growing like what what

959
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:50,959
about a facility that wants to bring in

960
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:52,798
multi-tier racking into an existing room

961
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,880
or even a new facility what are some of

962
00:32:52,798 --> 00:32:58,480
the challenges associated

963
00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:01,600
with these types of cultivation

964
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:04,319
methods so cost

965
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:06,319
goes up enormously simply because a the

966
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:07,038
cost of multi-tier racking is much

967
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:10,798
greater than

968
00:33:07,038 --> 00:33:13,679
single tier benching but two

969
00:33:10,798 --> 00:33:15,038
the cost of air distribution goes up

970
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:16,880
right so if you think about

971
00:33:15,038 --> 00:33:18,960
a typical room with a single tier bench

972
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:21,679
you can drop air in

973
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:23,759
from your system at the top right and

974
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:26,320
circulate that around

975
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:26,798
and and recycle it back through the back

976
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:30,240
through the

977
00:33:26,798 --> 00:33:33,200
either rooftop unit or or however you're

978
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:35,120
handling your air your air handling unit

979
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:38,080
in a multi-tiered system now

980
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:38,959
you need to get air into that space

981
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:40,720
between racks

982
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,159
as well you can't just drop it in from

983
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:45,278
the from the from the top

984
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:46,960
and and hope to cool evenly and and and

985
00:33:45,278 --> 00:33:49,278
evenly distribute the air

986
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:51,278
throughout the over over all the plants

987
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:51,759
so that is one thing that drives up cost

988
00:33:51,278 --> 00:33:55,200
as well

989
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:56,960
so so cost is one big hurdle

990
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,798
but there are huge efficiencies that go

991
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,558
up um

992
00:33:58,798 --> 00:34:02,879
to growing right you can double your

993
00:34:00,558 --> 00:34:05,119
plant count or maybe 1.5 times your

994
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:07,278
plant count

995
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:08,878
and but you have differences in labor

996
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:12,398
right there's there's you know

997
00:34:08,878 --> 00:34:14,239
some adjustments that have to be done um

998
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:16,078
one thing we advise people to do if

999
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:19,598
they're thinking about doing

1000
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:21,359
two-tiered racking systems is to

1001
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:22,639
start out in half the rooms right if

1002
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:23,679
you're if you're going in a phased

1003
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:25,919
approach

1004
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:28,240
put always start out with the with the

1005
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:31,039
method that you're going to

1006
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:32,878
employ um in the future right in the

1007
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:34,320
future phases so instead of thinking

1008
00:34:32,878 --> 00:34:36,480
about just doing

1009
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:39,440
single tier racks as your phase one and

1010
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:41,599
then two tier racks is your phase two

1011
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,599
rather start out with half the number of

1012
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:44,639
rooms but do the two tiered racks and

1013
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:48,079
that way your

1014
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:49,919
your labor becomes familiar with the

1015
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:52,000
with the with the process and then when

1016
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:55,039
you increase to your phase two

1017
00:34:52,000 --> 00:35:03,838
um you're not have you don't have to

1018
00:34:55,039 --> 00:35:03,838
learn something new

1019
00:35:43,358 --> 00:35:47,838
i think that's true yeah fundamentally

1020
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:50,480
if you are constrained for space

1021
00:35:47,838 --> 00:35:51,759
uh and want to increase your yields uh

1022
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,920
the only way to go is up

1023
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:56,000
right to multi-tier things i think you

1024
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,880
probably understand that implicitly in

1025
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,960
the veg

1026
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:01,039
in the in the case of veg plants right i

1027
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,159
mean almost everybody tears their veg

1028
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:04,000
plants

1029
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:06,879
because that gives you more room for

1030
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:10,960
flower and so

1031
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:14,480
right that's the same thinking now

1032
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:15,760
we do it um in cases where we're

1033
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,240
retrofitting

1034
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:19,920
former use buildings uh we do a lot of

1035
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:22,159
work maybe half half of our work is

1036
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:25,280
retrofit versus new build

1037
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:27,440
and when

1038
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,960
you know when an existing building uh if

1039
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:31,760
you have space limitations

1040
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:33,679
but you don't have height limitations

1041
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,800
then going up is you know with a natural

1042
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:38,078
solution

1043
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:41,839
so you build you know you have

1044
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:41,839
higher yields per square foot

1045
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:45,599
i have not done a three-tier grow yet

1046
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,280
but we've done a lot of two-tiered grow

1047
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:50,480
on on tip rack pip style

1048
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:53,200
uh racking systems um

1049
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,400
and have you seen any of those in in

1050
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:56,078
flower rooms

1051
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,000
yeah i do see lot in veg i think it

1052
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:59,680
makes a lot of sense in veg

1053
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,599
when we talk about flower though have

1054
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:02,239
you seen this successful with anyone

1055
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:05,519
doing

1056
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:09,118
purely organic production

1057
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:12,159
in two tiers yes

1058
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:13,838
so i have not personally um

1059
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:15,279
you know i you know i work with uh with

1060
00:37:13,838 --> 00:37:18,000
mike zartarian who

1061
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:20,160
who you know uh and he's been my council

1062
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:23,519
on on a lot of things

1063
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:25,440
no-till soil and organic living soils um

1064
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:27,039
and what i've learned from him is that

1065
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:29,599
yeah it's just

1066
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:30,639
it's harder to manage because you if you

1067
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:33,838
ever have to change that

1068
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:36,400
out that's just the weight uh and

1069
00:37:33,838 --> 00:37:37,119
volume of soil on two levels is is a

1070
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,358
bear

1071
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:40,960
uh and that's been one of my main

1072
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:41,598
takeaways that just stuck with me right

1073
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,480
if

1074
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:45,760
um that it's just it's harder to it's

1075
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,880
harder to work with

1076
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:53,440
uh with organic and and living soil on

1077
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:54,800
on two levels so i i haven't done it

1078
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,559
okay i was just curious to be seen i

1079
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,200
know there's a few people doing it right

1080
00:37:56,559 --> 00:38:00,078
now

1081
00:37:57,199 --> 00:38:00,879
uh but it has yet to be really proven to

1082
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:02,640
me

1083
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,559
if there's an existing facility that's

1084
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:05,199
been running for a while on two tiers

1085
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:07,279
using

1086
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:08,719
organics or living soils please reach

1087
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,160
out to me and let me know whoever is

1088
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:11,598
listening to this

1089
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:14,000
but i do know some that are being set up

1090
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:15,760
right now that i'm following closely

1091
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,599
looking forward to see how they turn out

1092
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:20,160
and i hope to do some research with it

1093
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:20,800
either at gold leaf or my buddies at

1094
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:23,118
legit

1095
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:24,560
but we haven't gotten around to it yet

1096
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:26,800
cat i'll take that back

1097
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:28,559
mike and i are doing one currently it's

1098
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:32,000
in design it's a very very small grow

1099
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:35,679
maybe 930 square feet of of

1100
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:38,239
bench area in a 2 000 square foot garage

1101
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:39,199
this is a great great example and it is

1102
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:41,199
in fact

1103
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:42,319
my memory has been jogged i do in fact

1104
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:45,598
have one

1105
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:46,400
that is two-tiered uh organic soil uh is

1106
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,838
not yet built

1107
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,680
it's been designed but it's not yet been

1108
00:38:47,838 --> 00:38:51,838
built so we don't have data on it but uh

1109
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:54,239
we'll be happy to follow up with you

1110
00:38:51,838 --> 00:38:56,960
uh or get um and get after after his

1111
00:38:54,239 --> 00:39:00,399
first harvest to get some data on it

1112
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:04,320
yeah that would be great i'll uh see you

1113
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:05,200
yeah so uh take me through a little bit

1114
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:08,079
of the process

1115
00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:08,960
if someone is going into this as a

1116
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:11,039
grower or

1117
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,880
as an investor or as a grower trying to

1118
00:39:11,039 --> 00:39:15,199
set up a new facility

1119
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:17,599
uh they would want to talk to someone

1120
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:19,598
like you obviously but there's other

1121
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:22,079
key players in this in this planning

1122
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:23,599
process um who are who are those key

1123
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:25,359
players like who do you think should be

1124
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:25,680
involved if someone's really interested

1125
00:39:25,358 --> 00:39:30,159
in

1126
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:33,358
properly setting up a new grow facility

1127
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:34,000
so um yeah that's a really that's a good

1128
00:39:33,358 --> 00:39:36,159
approach and

1129
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,199
and or good question the way we approach

1130
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:41,679
that is that

1131
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:42,480
um in the 60s when i started this work

1132
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:45,919
um

1133
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:47,599
six years ago in 2014

1134
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,599
i didn't know what horticulture process

1135
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:49,920
engineering was um it was not you know

1136
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:52,559
in

1137
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:54,159
i don't know i don't think i coined that

1138
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:57,358
term but i certainly in by

1139
00:39:54,159 --> 00:40:00,960
by 2019 um

1140
00:39:57,358 --> 00:40:02,480
last year i i would i don't do any jobs

1141
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,838
without a hort process engineer and

1142
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,280
there are some great ones i mentioned

1143
00:40:03,838 --> 00:40:07,679
mike zartarian

1144
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,119
tony van ice there's another one there's

1145
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:09,679
some there's some great folks around the

1146
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:11,920
country

1147
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:13,919
who's who serve that role and so that's

1148
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,920
one of the primary things

1149
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:17,920
in the way we practice uh that's

1150
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:19,200
different so so

1151
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,720
first and foremost it's because i'm

1152
00:40:19,199 --> 00:40:21,598
humble i don't claim to know everything

1153
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:24,239
i'm not you know

1154
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:25,519
growing growing plants is is in my

1155
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:27,759
background i actually grew up on a

1156
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:29,280
christmas tree farm in connecticut

1157
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:31,599
so i have put things in the dirt and

1158
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:33,680
added salt and added lime and

1159
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:35,359
you know various nutrients but i don't

1160
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:38,239
claim to be an expert on on

1161
00:40:35,358 --> 00:40:41,519
on everything horticultural so bringing

1162
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:44,078
on that expertise to my team is step one

1163
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:45,838
understanding my customers kpis key

1164
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:50,160
performance indicators

1165
00:40:45,838 --> 00:40:50,159
is really step two because that is where

1166
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:53,439
the money comes from right is that it's

1167
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:55,680
that promise that we make to our

1168
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,159
investors that that allows us to operate

1169
00:40:55,679 --> 00:41:00,480
and so

1170
00:40:56,159 --> 00:41:02,879
understanding those kpis um is key so if

1171
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,760
if manufacturing is part of the is part

1172
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,680
of the plan

1173
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:08,560
uh then bringing in somebody with an

1174
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:10,559
expertise let's say it's ethanol

1175
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:12,480
and ethanol extraction and hat will

1176
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:16,000
bring in that person on our team

1177
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:17,838
um so excuse me so we have

1178
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,440
so getting the team i guess what i'm

1179
00:41:17,838 --> 00:41:22,480
underscoring here is getting the team

1180
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:24,400
right um from

1181
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,800
from the uh from the growers perspective

1182
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:29,599
and from the entrepreneur's perspective

1183
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,318
um it's well from the growers it's about

1184
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:32,800
horticulture

1185
00:41:30,318 --> 00:41:33,759
it's about process and flow from the

1186
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,000
entrepreneurs and

1187
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:37,680
you know from the c-suite the the ceo

1188
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,318
cfo coo

1189
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:41,440
uh it's about those kpis and managing

1190
00:41:40,318 --> 00:41:43,519
the entire process

1191
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:45,200
so we bring in so we look at the entire

1192
00:41:43,519 --> 00:41:46,239
process meaning there's a facility

1193
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:48,399
there's a whole building

1194
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:50,239
and it's made up of certain key key

1195
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:52,160
parts horticulture

1196
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:54,159
first and foremost second is

1197
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:56,239
manufacturing

1198
00:41:54,159 --> 00:41:57,279
uh and the third is is management of the

1199
00:41:56,239 --> 00:41:59,039
employees right

1200
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:00,319
understanding the employees have a break

1201
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:02,639
room and that they have

1202
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:03,440
the right you know bathroom and shower

1203
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:07,279
facilities

1204
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:09,519
and um so getting the team right is part

1205
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:12,800
of it um

1206
00:42:09,519 --> 00:42:15,679
there's a lot of players that help

1207
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:17,039
at the various stages so civil engineers

1208
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:19,679
that lay out parking

1209
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:21,440
and you know figure out the boundaries

1210
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:24,318
and the topography of the site and what

1211
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:24,318
can be put where

1212
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:29,279
and so we work very closely with civil

1213
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:31,598
engineers on every job that we do

1214
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:33,280
even if it's an existing building we

1215
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:33,838
still have a civil engineer who is the

1216
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,640
one who

1217
00:42:33,838 --> 00:42:38,159
who really interfaces with the town when

1218
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:41,358
it comes to getting permits

1219
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:43,838
uh at the early stages and

1220
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:45,440
um we work closely with legal counsel

1221
00:42:43,838 --> 00:42:46,799
from our with our customers

1222
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,720
understanding what their you know what

1223
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:51,680
their obligations are legally

1224
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:54,078
um what their license with their stage

1225
00:42:51,679 --> 00:42:55,919
they're in in the licensing process

1226
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:57,680
so that the work in planning for the

1227
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:00,240
facility lines up

1228
00:42:57,679 --> 00:43:00,879
neatly with uh with their licensing

1229
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:03,279
process

1230
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:04,880
and with their capital capital draws

1231
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,240
when you know when when their funding is

1232
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,519
available

1233
00:43:06,239 --> 00:43:09,358
because one of the hard things in

1234
00:43:07,519 --> 00:43:12,000
cannabis is everybody knows

1235
00:43:09,358 --> 00:43:14,159
is the start stop start stop start stop

1236
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:17,440
it's gas and break gas and break

1237
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:21,039
so we try to work with customers on

1238
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:23,200
sort of capex planning in addition to

1239
00:43:21,039 --> 00:43:26,079
team building it's understanding when

1240
00:43:23,199 --> 00:43:28,000
capital is needed and how much so that

1241
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:29,119
our customer can talk intelligently to

1242
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,358
their funders

1243
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:33,039
and to say here's a milestone this is

1244
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:34,559
what the whole team is doing

1245
00:43:33,039 --> 00:43:36,159
and this is what it's going to cost to

1246
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:37,759
get to that milestone

1247
00:43:36,159 --> 00:43:39,118
and then here's the next milestone

1248
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,560
here's what the team needs to do to get

1249
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:42,160
to that milestone

1250
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:44,000
and there's c down way down there in the

1251
00:43:42,159 --> 00:43:45,199
distance that's milestone number three

1252
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,000
and that's where we start to turn a

1253
00:43:45,199 --> 00:43:49,919
profit and we work with our customers to

1254
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,719
give them that ability to communicate at

1255
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,079
that level

1256
00:43:50,719 --> 00:43:53,759
right so that you you know what the

1257
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:55,440
milestone coming up is you know who all

1258
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:57,680
your team members

1259
00:43:55,440 --> 00:44:00,000
are that are contributing to that to the

1260
00:43:57,679 --> 00:44:03,039
success of that milestone

1261
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,400
and you can better evaluate risk you

1262
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:05,679
know what's the risk if we don't hit the

1263
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:09,280
milestone or if

1264
00:44:05,679 --> 00:44:10,799
somebody tells us no when we get there

1265
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:14,079
so it's about team building and then

1266
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:15,599
about good forecasting

1267
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:17,599
yeah that's that's a lot it's a little

1268
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:18,079
scary to me just even when you say it

1269
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:19,838
like this

1270
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:21,359
i think of all the steps and costs

1271
00:44:19,838 --> 00:44:23,358
associated with setting up a new

1272
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:24,960
facility and it's uh it can be pretty

1273
00:44:23,358 --> 00:44:28,159
massive

1274
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:30,960
um yeah yeah and realistically

1275
00:44:28,159 --> 00:44:32,078
uh there's so many hurdles along the way

1276
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,079
that people

1277
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:35,760
don't realize when they first get

1278
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:37,760
started i mean in some states like

1279
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:39,520
oklahoma it's it's fairly simple in

1280
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:42,640
other states like where you are

1281
00:44:39,519 --> 00:44:46,079
it's it can be really challenging so

1282
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:48,960
uh it's unfortunate like looking at it

1283
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:50,560
from a grower's perspective uh myself

1284
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,920
like all of this stuff is sort of things

1285
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:53,440
that i don't want to deal with i don't

1286
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,800
even want to think about i just want to

1287
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,358
get in there and start working with some

1288
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,480
plants

1289
00:44:55,358 --> 00:45:00,559
and uh right you can't do that like

1290
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:02,639
that's unfortunate but it's the reality

1291
00:45:00,559 --> 00:45:04,159
of the fact that this

1292
00:45:02,639 --> 00:45:05,759
if you want to do this commercially and

1293
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:07,440
legally you have to start thinking of it

1294
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,400
like a business and that's not to take

1295
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:11,039
away

1296
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:12,800
from the art and craft of cultivation

1297
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:13,279
and the science around cultivation it's

1298
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,400
just

1299
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:16,720
these are the steps that you're going to

1300
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:18,079
have to go through just to be able to

1301
00:45:16,719 --> 00:45:19,919
allow the government to allow you to do

1302
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:21,760
what you want to do

1303
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:23,760
ted you reminded me of something yeah we

1304
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:26,400
met at the photo x

1305
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:28,560
photobiology conference in austin texas

1306
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:31,519
last year one of the presenters there

1307
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:32,719
um hit something home for me which is

1308
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:35,280
that

1309
00:45:32,719 --> 00:45:38,879
just because we like to grow it doesn't

1310
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:40,960
mean it's what the customer wants to buy

1311
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:42,160
and i think that's a mantra that makes a

1312
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:44,960
lot of sense to me

1313
00:45:42,159 --> 00:45:46,639
because i mean a lot of folks coming in

1314
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:48,240
and

1315
00:45:46,639 --> 00:45:50,480
they point and they say i want one of

1316
00:45:48,239 --> 00:45:51,279
those meaning a cultivation facility

1317
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,920
right

1318
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:55,119
and they don't yet know what their

1319
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,480
customer is demanding

1320
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:59,358
they've never really pulled their

1321
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:00,960
customers there's just a sort of general

1322
00:45:59,358 --> 00:46:02,960
attitude out there that everybody wants

1323
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:04,400
to buy weeds so if i can grow weed i can

1324
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:06,318
mint money

1325
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,519
and i think the industry is maturing now

1326
00:46:06,318 --> 00:46:10,719
to a level where

1327
00:46:07,519 --> 00:46:13,119
people really need to focus in on

1328
00:46:10,719 --> 00:46:14,399
not just we're going to grow we're going

1329
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:15,838
to grow cannabis and we're going to a

1330
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,358
really good cannabis we're going to grow

1331
00:46:15,838 --> 00:46:19,519
prize cannabis but rather

1332
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:20,880
is understanding the customer base and

1333
00:46:19,519 --> 00:46:23,358
saying which

1334
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:24,880
you know are we selling only to you know

1335
00:46:23,358 --> 00:46:27,920
millen you know

1336
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:28,400
boomer women right who are over 65 years

1337
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:31,200
old

1338
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:32,559
right now you're focused down to a

1339
00:46:31,199 --> 00:46:34,318
really specific

1340
00:46:32,559 --> 00:46:36,639
customer group understand what those

1341
00:46:34,318 --> 00:46:39,920
people want and produce

1342
00:46:36,639 --> 00:46:41,440
what that demand dictates right that is

1343
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:43,200
a different idea

1344
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:44,800
about that's the sort of business

1345
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:46,399
approach doesn't mean that you you can't

1346
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:49,519
grow the the best weed you've

1347
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:50,720
ever grown or get to do to grow the way

1348
00:46:49,519 --> 00:46:52,239
you want to grow but it's really

1349
00:46:50,719 --> 00:46:54,159
understanding what is the output and who

1350
00:46:52,239 --> 00:46:57,358
is it intended for

1351
00:46:54,159 --> 00:46:58,318
um yeah that's a great point that's a

1352
00:46:57,358 --> 00:47:00,000
really good point because

1353
00:46:58,318 --> 00:47:02,000
i know a lot of for a lot of growers

1354
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,880
like high-end flower is the

1355
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,480
is sort of the end-all be-all uh yet

1356
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:07,599
here in washington the market has

1357
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:09,280
changed to where

1358
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:11,920
a lot of stuff is going you know being

1359
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:14,400
made into distillate or edibles or

1360
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:15,599
uh even pre-rolls that become really

1361
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:18,318
popular

1362
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:19,680
and uh it's it's funny because from a

1363
00:47:18,318 --> 00:47:21,358
grower perspective they're like i can i

1364
00:47:19,679 --> 00:47:22,879
can roll my own joint

1365
00:47:21,358 --> 00:47:24,400
i would rather see the flower and have

1366
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:26,720
good flower

1367
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:27,920
but that's not necessarily what's moving

1368
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:30,078
off the shelves

1369
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:31,680
as quickly and not everyone can produce

1370
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:33,119
high-end flower like there's only room

1371
00:47:31,679 --> 00:47:34,318
for so many people at the top of that

1372
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:36,480
pyramid

1373
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:38,480
so it is something to consider uh you

1374
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,679
know what what is your audience in all

1375
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,400
of this i think that's a really good

1376
00:47:39,679 --> 00:47:42,558
point

1377
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:43,920
and that kind of transitions sort of to

1378
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:45,119
my next question one of the things that

1379
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:47,358
you brought up

1380
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:48,720
uh which wasn't a term that i was

1381
00:47:47,358 --> 00:47:50,480
particularly familiar with when we

1382
00:47:48,719 --> 00:47:52,480
started talking about it was this idea

1383
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:53,519
of toll processing can you talk a little

1384
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:56,639
bit about what

1385
00:47:53,519 --> 00:47:58,159
toll processing is and how it fits

1386
00:47:56,639 --> 00:48:00,558
in the cannabis industry and what the

1387
00:47:58,159 --> 00:48:05,358
potential is there

1388
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:08,480
we've seen a trend here in massachusetts

1389
00:48:05,358 --> 00:48:10,960
excuse me which is that um

1390
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:12,719
it's not that hard to spot which is that

1391
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:15,440
there's a lot of profit to be made

1392
00:48:12,719 --> 00:48:16,159
in processing right you're not just a

1393
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:18,318
farmer

1394
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:20,239
you know field gating uh you know at

1395
00:48:18,318 --> 00:48:21,519
wholesale prices but if you can turn it

1396
00:48:20,239 --> 00:48:23,519
into a product

1397
00:48:21,519 --> 00:48:24,639
uh there's a much higher margin to be to

1398
00:48:23,519 --> 00:48:27,838
be derived from the

1399
00:48:24,639 --> 00:48:29,598
from at the end of the day so um

1400
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:31,679
we're actually when people when our

1401
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:33,838
customers now we have i'm seeing it over

1402
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:35,199
and over when they have a choice of

1403
00:48:33,838 --> 00:48:37,759
phasing their construction

1404
00:48:35,199 --> 00:48:39,199
based on limited dollars our customers

1405
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:42,319
are choosing to build the

1406
00:48:39,199 --> 00:48:43,439
the processing facility first and that's

1407
00:48:42,318 --> 00:48:46,000
an interesting trend

1408
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:46,639
and uh the next trend that i'm seeing we

1409
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,880
have

1410
00:48:46,639 --> 00:48:50,639
another customer who is specifically

1411
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:53,200
asked us to design

1412
00:48:50,639 --> 00:48:54,000
the processing which is extraction post

1413
00:48:53,199 --> 00:48:56,399
extraction

1414
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,760
the white film the the flowing film the

1415
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:00,400
winterizing and the and the

1416
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:02,400
to get to broad spectrum distillate and

1417
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:06,559
the manufacturing piece

1418
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:09,920
to size that for a capacity that exceeds

1419
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:12,319
what their what they can grow so

1420
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:14,318
if you have a way of you know estimating

1421
00:49:12,318 --> 00:49:15,199
grow you know at let's pick an average

1422
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:18,079
number of

1423
00:49:15,199 --> 00:49:19,679
40 grams 42 grams per square foot right

1424
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:20,318
and you calculate from that that you can

1425
00:49:19,679 --> 00:49:23,598
do

1426
00:49:20,318 --> 00:49:23,599
5 000 pounds a year

1427
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:27,680
toll processing would be where you would

1428
00:49:25,519 --> 00:49:29,119
manually you would create the capacity

1429
00:49:27,679 --> 00:49:30,879
to handle handle

1430
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:32,480
ten thousand pounds a year so there's

1431
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:35,920
five thousand pounds of

1432
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:37,519
bio mass that you can buy from other

1433
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:40,960
growers at wholesale

1434
00:49:37,519 --> 00:49:43,039
and process and put out product so

1435
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:45,039
toll processing sort of like a toll road

1436
00:49:43,039 --> 00:49:47,039
means you paid it you paid a drive on it

1437
00:49:45,039 --> 00:49:49,199
uh you you would pay you would uh you

1438
00:49:47,039 --> 00:49:50,719
know so the processor who's doing toll

1439
00:49:49,199 --> 00:49:53,279
processing is doing

1440
00:49:50,719 --> 00:49:54,799
is not just in many cases they're not

1441
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:56,480
just a processor they're

1442
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:58,480
not just a manufacturer they're also a

1443
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:00,159
grower but they will actually

1444
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:01,838
buy in excess of what they can grow

1445
00:50:00,159 --> 00:50:05,279
themselves at the wholesale

1446
00:50:01,838 --> 00:50:05,920
and then be able to manufacture more

1447
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:08,480
than

1448
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:10,159
what they could otherwise yeah that's an

1449
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,639
interesting concept have you seen that

1450
00:50:10,159 --> 00:50:12,719
occur

1451
00:50:10,639 --> 00:50:14,799
on the other end like on the propagation

1452
00:50:12,719 --> 00:50:15,759
side i know here in washington there was

1453
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:18,160
a company

1454
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:19,680
uh when we first switched over to rec

1455
00:50:18,159 --> 00:50:22,719
called the clone zone

1456
00:50:19,679 --> 00:50:25,118
and they were able to fund their

1457
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:26,719
build out of a new facility based off of

1458
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:28,880
selling clones

1459
00:50:26,719 --> 00:50:30,480
to the rest of the washington market

1460
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:32,079
when it first got started because

1461
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:34,240
everyone was looking for plants at the

1462
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:36,880
beginning they had all the you know hype

1463
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:37,919
cultivars at the time and it was a

1464
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:41,280
really smart

1465
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:43,200
business move for them to provide

1466
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:44,960
you know provide starts for people now

1467
00:50:43,199 --> 00:50:46,480
there's a lot of challenges from an ipm

1468
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:48,880
perspective and insects and

1469
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:50,318
liability around all those things but uh

1470
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:52,480
the potential for

1471
00:50:50,318 --> 00:50:53,599
for a business opportunity there i think

1472
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:57,519
is really high

1473
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:58,880
in new states well you know i so i told

1474
00:50:57,519 --> 00:51:00,159
you that i grew up on a christmas tree

1475
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:01,519
farm right so

1476
00:51:00,159 --> 00:51:02,799
there's there's no there's not a

1477
00:51:01,519 --> 00:51:03,440
christmas tree farmer in the united

1478
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:06,318
states who

1479
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:06,960
who grows their own tree from seedlings

1480
00:51:06,318 --> 00:51:10,000
the state

1481
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:12,159
fills that role almost everybody buys

1482
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,000
seedlings which we would call it you

1483
00:51:12,159 --> 00:51:14,480
know a small a young plant coming you

1484
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,920
know

1485
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:19,358
with a root system um from a supplier

1486
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:21,519
like you what you're talking about now

1487
00:51:19,358 --> 00:51:24,639
is a mature horticulture market

1488
00:51:21,519 --> 00:51:25,920
it's very similar in flowers it's

1489
00:51:24,639 --> 00:51:27,838
certainly true in

1490
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:29,280
trees think about every nursery you

1491
00:51:27,838 --> 00:51:30,799
drive by

1492
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:32,079
that's what they are that's what you

1493
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:33,359
know that's what the name implies right

1494
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:36,160
it's a nursery

1495
00:51:33,358 --> 00:51:37,920
so for the landscape industry uh there

1496
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:38,719
are that's that's what a mature market

1497
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:41,119
looks like

1498
00:51:38,719 --> 00:51:43,279
where you have different businesses set

1499
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:46,318
up to handle different stages

1500
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:49,200
of plant growth uh i think cannabis is

1501
00:51:46,318 --> 00:51:52,159
otherwise unique in the fact that it it

1502
00:51:49,199 --> 00:51:53,838
tackles the whole piece and that's

1503
00:51:52,159 --> 00:51:55,358
coming out of prohibition right that was

1504
00:51:53,838 --> 00:51:56,480
a dictate because it's been under

1505
00:51:55,358 --> 00:52:00,880
prohibition

1506
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:03,119
i think as as as the industry you know

1507
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:04,079
matures people will find business

1508
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:07,039
opportunities

1509
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:08,720
with small niches like that yeah and i

1510
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:10,480
think this idea of toll processing

1511
00:52:08,719 --> 00:52:12,480
to get back to that idea really

1512
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:14,079
mitigates a lot of the risks associated

1513
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:17,039
with poor crop performance

1514
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:18,160
or crop loss sure you know you know you

1515
00:52:17,039 --> 00:52:20,000
know what you're buying it's already a

1516
00:52:18,159 --> 00:52:22,480
commodity at this point and then you can

1517
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,920
manufacture it into whatever

1518
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:25,838
you want to manufacture and you already

1519
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:27,838
know what the market will bear

1520
00:52:25,838 --> 00:52:29,199
on that end so the risk associated with

1521
00:52:27,838 --> 00:52:32,719
it would be much lower

1522
00:52:29,199 --> 00:52:34,078
i would i would assume

1523
00:52:32,719 --> 00:52:36,000
the risk is slower and the profit

1524
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:38,000
margin's higher uh there's just

1525
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,519
the cost to get in is more expensive

1526
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
though what you can you know as you as

1527
00:52:39,519 --> 00:52:42,079
you know

1528
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,679
when you've looked at you know ethanol

1529
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:44,400
processing equipment that's expensive

1530
00:52:43,679 --> 00:52:46,239
buy

1531
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:47,920
it's not a cheap it's not a cheap entry

1532
00:52:46,239 --> 00:52:51,838
point uh but

1533
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:51,838
you know the roi is certainly there

1534
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:55,760
yeah so brian just to change directions

1535
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:57,200
one last time here

1536
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:58,960
one of the things that you and i talked

1537
00:52:57,199 --> 00:53:00,000
about uh when we were waiting at the

1538
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:01,440
airport was

1539
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,280
some of the stuff you're doing around

1540
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:04,240
cannabis advocacy and you were kind of

1541
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:06,800
sharing

1542
00:53:04,239 --> 00:53:07,519
some of your thoughts around the

1543
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,519
direction

1544
00:53:07,519 --> 00:53:11,119
of the cannabis industry on more of a

1545
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:12,159
national level

1546
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:15,680
do you want to talk a little about what

1547
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:17,838
you have going on on that side of things

1548
00:53:15,679 --> 00:53:20,000
i'll put in sure i'm happy to i'll put

1549
00:53:17,838 --> 00:53:21,599
in two big plugs um

1550
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,400
shameless plugs to non-profit

1551
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:26,318
organizations i volunteer with the

1552
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:28,000
ncia national cannabis industry

1553
00:53:26,318 --> 00:53:30,880
association i put a lot of time

1554
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:33,358
in there i chair a committee we're

1555
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:35,760
called the facility design committee um

1556
00:53:33,358 --> 00:53:37,440
as an appropriate place for an architect

1557
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:38,960
i guess um

1558
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:41,119
and that's a committee that i actually

1559
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:43,039
started didn't exist

1560
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:44,720
before this year i'm just coming up to

1561
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:47,358
the end of a one-year term

1562
00:53:44,719 --> 00:53:48,558
there's a great group of people um

1563
00:53:47,358 --> 00:53:51,598
there's about 10 of us

1564
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:54,960
who are active uh from from from

1565
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:58,400
sacramento to boston we meet

1566
00:53:54,960 --> 00:54:02,318
we we um meet once a month

1567
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:03,519
and um and we're making some good

1568
00:54:02,318 --> 00:54:05,759
progress we'll be um

1569
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:08,159
pushing out information for growers

1570
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:09,839
about facilities through the ncia

1571
00:54:08,159 --> 00:54:11,598
there's a series of podcasts not to

1572
00:54:09,838 --> 00:54:14,880
compete with utah but there is uh

1573
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:16,400
nci he does also host podcasts look for

1574
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:19,280
some information there

1575
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:21,200
nca does websites excuse me webinars i

1576
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:24,559
misspoke their webinars

1577
00:54:21,199 --> 00:54:26,000
and they obviously have you know they

1578
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:28,400
trade shows as well so there's uh

1579
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:31,920
there's one coming up in san francisco

1580
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:33,760
um at the end of september and um

1581
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:35,440
so we so those are three ways in which

1582
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:37,599
the ncia's

1583
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:39,838
facility design committee is going to

1584
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:42,079
get information out so that's i'm happy

1585
00:54:39,838 --> 00:54:43,679
to talk about that

1586
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:45,519
it's a good organization it has you know

1587
00:54:43,679 --> 00:54:48,960
its main mission is is

1588
00:54:45,519 --> 00:54:50,559
advocacy at the federal level

1589
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:52,000
but i think it does a pretty good job as

1590
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:56,640
well of getting information

1591
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:59,199
out to members and to non-members alike

1592
00:54:56,639 --> 00:55:00,078
the other group is out of portland

1593
00:54:59,199 --> 00:55:03,039
oregon they're called

1594
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:05,119
rii resource international that resource

1595
00:55:03,039 --> 00:55:05,838
innovation institute excuse me rii

1596
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:07,599
resource

1597
00:55:05,838 --> 00:55:08,960
innovation institute derek smith is a

1598
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:12,318
director

1599
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:12,318
and i volunteer a lot with them

1600
00:55:13,358 --> 00:55:17,358
we just did a webinar last week for

1601
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,440
michigan growers

1602
00:55:17,358 --> 00:55:20,798
about called efficient yields and you

1603
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:22,000
can find more information on their

1604
00:55:20,798 --> 00:55:24,798
website

1605
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:26,798
rii's website about their efficient

1606
00:55:24,798 --> 00:55:28,639
yields webinar program

1607
00:55:26,798 --> 00:55:30,318
for michigan there's more coming up and

1608
00:55:28,639 --> 00:55:32,639
then there's they've got one slated for

1609
00:55:30,318 --> 00:55:35,199
massachusetts growers as well

1610
00:55:32,639 --> 00:55:36,639
i think they do a really good job of

1611
00:55:35,199 --> 00:55:38,000
harnessing

1612
00:55:36,639 --> 00:55:40,239
when you want to have a discussion

1613
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:43,199
around sustainability and efficiency in

1614
00:55:40,239 --> 00:55:44,078
energy consumption and water consumption

1615
00:55:43,199 --> 00:55:45,519
and

1616
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:48,720
utility how to interface with the

1617
00:55:45,519 --> 00:55:51,838
utilities rii is doing a lot of

1618
00:55:48,719 --> 00:55:53,439
good work in getting growers to talk to

1619
00:55:51,838 --> 00:55:55,599
utility people i think that's an

1620
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:57,119
important step right they we used to

1621
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:58,480
run away from the utilities because they

1622
00:55:57,119 --> 00:56:00,240
were the people who would report us to

1623
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:01,920
the police kind of thing

1624
00:56:00,239 --> 00:56:03,838
today it's different an early

1625
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:06,880
relationship with utilities

1626
00:56:03,838 --> 00:56:07,199
is really key to a facility's success

1627
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:08,960
right

1628
00:56:07,199 --> 00:56:10,639
getting your power on time getting it

1629
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:11,599
non-interrupted getting the right amount

1630
00:56:10,639 --> 00:56:14,078
of power

1631
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:16,160
or gas if it's a gas pipeline or

1632
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:18,400
electrical service

1633
00:56:16,159 --> 00:56:19,519
rii does a really good job of advocating

1634
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:21,838
for growers

1635
00:56:19,519 --> 00:56:23,199
and bringing growers and utility

1636
00:56:21,838 --> 00:56:25,599
companies together

1637
00:56:23,199 --> 00:56:27,598
in discussions around energy efficiency

1638
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:30,640
so a big plug for

1639
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:32,000
for derrick smith well and hopefully

1640
00:56:30,639 --> 00:56:34,558
getting your rebate too

1641
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,599
uh in in states where that's applicable

1642
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:38,079
like here in washington

1643
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:38,880
that's a lot of money yeah oh these are

1644
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:42,079
these are these are

1645
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:44,000
high six figures right high six figures

1646
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:45,680
uh that custard that our customers are

1647
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,798
getting back um

1648
00:56:45,679 --> 00:56:48,879
and you know you talked about the

1649
00:56:46,798 --> 00:56:51,280
difference in in cost right the

1650
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:53,039
the high cost of led lighting fixtures

1651
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:55,280
you know there's many claims out there

1652
00:56:53,039 --> 00:56:56,159
that the cost is based on the fact that

1653
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:59,280
the rebates

1654
00:56:56,159 --> 00:57:01,679
are out there right if you can pay 330

1655
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:04,640
bucks for a double-ended hps

1656
00:57:01,679 --> 00:57:05,199
you know why would you spend 12 to 1500

1657
00:57:04,639 --> 00:57:07,039
for a

1658
00:57:05,199 --> 00:57:08,480
for an led light fixture well many of

1659
00:57:07,039 --> 00:57:09,679
the reasons are is because in certain

1660
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:12,480
states

1661
00:57:09,679 --> 00:57:13,679
70 of that delta is paid for by the

1662
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:16,719
utility

1663
00:57:13,679 --> 00:57:17,598
right yeah that brings that cost down

1664
00:57:16,719 --> 00:57:20,480
enormously so

1665
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:21,119
so talking early to your utility about

1666
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:24,798
rebates

1667
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:26,720
