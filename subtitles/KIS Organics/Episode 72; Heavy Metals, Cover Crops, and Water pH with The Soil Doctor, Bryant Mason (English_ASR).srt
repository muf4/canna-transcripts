welcome to the Cannabis cultivation and

3
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,118
science podcast I'm your host Tad hussy

4
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,560
of Kiss Organics this is the podcast

5
00:00:24,118 --> 00:00:27,599
where we discuss The Cutting Edge of

6
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:29,399
growing from a science-based perspective

7
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,879
and drawn top experts from around the

8
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:33,159
industry to share their wisdom and

9
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:35,839
knowledge my guest this week is Bryant

10
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:37,759
Mason Bryant is a certified crop adviser

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,000
who specializes in organic cannabis

12
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:41,960
nutrition he has spent the last 3 years

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,119
working to combine Precision laboratory

14
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,960
techniques with data science in an

15
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:48,280
effort to unravel the complexities of

16
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,320
cannabis soil and crop nutrition along

17
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,799
with his work on soiless media he also

18
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,320
helps outdoor cultivators around the US

19
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:56,159
with nutrient management and cover

20
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,238
cropping if you would like to do soil

21
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:04,319
testing or help interpreting a soil test

22
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:08,158
his website is WW W soyd consulting.com

23
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:11,519
hey Brian thanks for coming on the

24
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,719
show thanks for having me Tad yeah I

25
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:15,438
know we've talked a lot off air and had

26
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:17,478
a lot of long conversations I love

27
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:20,199
chatting with you about soil and soil

28
00:01:17,478 --> 00:01:23,118
science so I'm I'm really glad to have

29
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:25,400
you on the podcast uh can we start off

30
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:27,840
uh telling the listeners a little bit

31
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,840
about your

32
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:33,920
background sure I I am a certified crop

33
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,680
advisor through the American Association

34
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,118
of

35
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:41,399
agronomy which essentially means that I

36
00:01:38,118 --> 00:01:44,519
went through a series of tests to get

37
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:47,239
certified and I work with a number of

38
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:49,840
different Growers on soil and crop

39
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:52,959
nutrition so I specialize specifically

40
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,520
on nutrient management and even more

41
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:57,599
than that organic nutrient management so

42
00:01:55,519 --> 00:02:00,599
I work with a number of different crops

43
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:03,038
but primarily cannabis and Prim ly

44
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:05,559
soiless media so I've really enjoyed

45
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:07,039
listening to your show and I think we've

46
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,598
we always have a lot to talk about so

47
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:11,239
I'm looking forward to it yeah me too

48
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:15,639
and for people who haven't checked out

49
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:17,360
Bryant's Instagram it's uh _ do be sure

50
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:20,238
to check that out he's always putting up

51
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,120
new videos walking around in cool places

52
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:25,000
talking about organic matter or

53
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:27,599
irrigation or numerous topics so I want

54
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,400
to recommend that real quick for people

55
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:31,919
um but let's dive in talking about

56
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,439
um something you and I have talked a

57
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:36,199
little bit about is this theory of of

58
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:39,079
soil testing with soilless media versus

59
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:41,359
actual real top soil and sort of what

60
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:43,200
those differences are because they're

61
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,760
quite different media with quite

62
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:48,759
different levels of expertise um do you

63
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:51,000
want to kind of take that

64
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:54,318
away sure and this is one of the most

65
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,519
fascinating topics to me because as I've

66
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:58,919
worked more and more with cannabis

67
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:01,800
production over the last several years

68
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:03,479
I've noticed that that a lot of the

69
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,879
traditional soil science developed in

70
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:09,359
Top Soil top soil being real mineral

71
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:11,439
soil composed of sand silt and Clay just

72
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,239
doesn't necessarily apply to soiless

73
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:18,799
Media the major differences um that I

74
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:20,840
think about are um the homogeneous

75
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:25,519
nature of top soil so for eons it's been

76
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:27,439
mixed and um t uh soiless media isn't

77
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,719
necessarily like that so it has larger

78
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:34,438
particle sizes that are are not quite as

79
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:37,000
homogeneous um and also the underlying

80
00:03:34,438 --> 00:03:39,519
difference is that there isn't any clay

81
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,479
in a soiless media so when you look at

82
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,640
the CC on a soil test for example uh

83
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:46,679
it's the cation exchange capacity that

84
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:48,759
measures the soils ability to hold

85
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,480
nutrients on the clay colloid it has to

86
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:52,719
be interpreted differently as does the

87
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:55,399
organic matter number and really going

88
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:57,199
down the list um you you really have to

89
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:00,480
look at the soil chemistry quite a bit

90
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:02,199
differently in a in a soilless media

91
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:03,479
um the other obvious difference that

92
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:05,839
that most people understand is the

93
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:09,119
physical characteristics uh there's much

94
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,799
more um poor space in the soiless media

95
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,438
it drains more quickly and therefore um

96
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:16,079
because there's no clay colloid and

97
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:18,959
because of that high drainage ability it

98
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,840
doesn't necessarily hold nutrients as

99
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,000
easily and so the majority of nutrient

100
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:26,560
holding capacity tends to come through

101
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
organic matter as oppos as opposed to

102
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,478
Mineral colloids so those are just a a

103
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,720
handful of different is I can kind of

104
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:36,879
stop there but um more or less I think

105
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:41,039
about solubility a lot in a soilless

106
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:43,399
media and I think less about balancing

107
00:04:41,038 --> 00:04:45,800
the mineral

108
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:48,000
colloid I definitely want to hear your

109
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,680
thoughts on that um but just I want to

110
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,879
back up really quickly so when we are

111
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,879
looking and evaluating a soil for

112
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:56,319
example or a soiless media traditionally

113
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:59,478
with soil we're talking

114
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:00,800
about three things at least in my brain

115
00:04:59,478 --> 00:05:02,639
um you may correct me based on your

116
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,439
Agronomy background but I think of the

117
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:08,360
physical properties of the soil which

118
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:11,360
would be sand silk clay or that air to

119
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:12,879
water ratio I think about the biological

120
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,080
properties of the soil that's all the

121
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:17,120
microorganism soil food website and then

122
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:19,038
I think about the mineral aspects of the

123
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,360
soil what sort of nutrition does that

124
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:23,079
infertility does that soil hold and so

125
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,120
those three things kind of form like a a

126
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:27,198
mental triangle for me when I'm

127
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,840
evaluating or sort of trying to look at

128
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,960
what the limiting factor of growth might

129
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:34,799
be in a given soil um can you kind of

130
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:36,959
talk a little bit about how these sort

131
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,520
of I guess pillars work together in

132
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:41,799
forming our understanding of

133
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:43,799
soil absolutely and I think that that

134
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,759
mental triangle is perfect I think about

135
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,280
that all the time as well and the

136
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,400
connection between the two is what's

137
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:53,119
Most Fascinating and so how I think

138
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:57,198
about it is that uh the biology is

139
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:59,439
critical for um primarily nutrient

140
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,919
cycling so that's that's really how I

141
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:02,399
think think about the connection between

142
00:06:00,918 --> 00:06:05,279
chemistry and biology is that the the

143
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:07,799
biology is mineralizing or releasing

144
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:09,318
nutrients from the soil constantly and

145
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,598
there's a number of mechanisms in which

146
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:15,680
it does that and providing nutrient

147
00:06:12,598 --> 00:06:17,079
availability to the plant and it's also

148
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,879
connected to the physical

149
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:22,478
characteristics of the soil because the

150
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:24,639
habitat as we all know soil is an

151
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:27,680
ecosystem and so if you zoomed in you

152
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:31,000
would see pore space and a number of

153
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:34,680
different um almost

154
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:38,759
I imagine the favellas um packed in

155
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:41,160
habitat where biology lives and so the

156
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:43,759
the gas exchange the water exchange all

157
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,560
of that the pH the Redux all of that

158
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,160
chemistry and all of that those physical

159
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:50,720
characteristics will Define the

160
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:55,479
biological community in act in a in a uh

161
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:58,160
a soil and um so you know when I think

162
00:06:55,478 --> 00:07:01,079
about the three characteristics of

163
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,520
soil that you described I really think

164
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:05,399
about well what is it that we should be

165
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:08,240
managing and every single thing you do

166
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:11,159
to a soil will change all three of those

167
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,478
characteristics and so um as an

168
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,680
agronomist I think about you know how

169
00:07:13,478 --> 00:07:18,639
can we measure and

170
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,280
manage uh the physical characteristics

171
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,598
and the chemical characteristics

172
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:24,439
primarily which will ultimately dictate

173
00:07:22,598 --> 00:07:26,959
that biological profile and I know that

174
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:29,598
a lot of cannabis Growers are also very

175
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:32,279
passionate about managing the biological

176
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:33,918
IAL elements of soil but I think to your

177
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:35,839
point they're all critically important

178
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:37,159
and all highly interrelated and they

179
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:39,198
should all be considered with every

180
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,960
single decision that we make whether

181
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,960
it's an input decision or a tillage

182
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:45,959
decision or a cover cropping

183
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:48,038
decision yeah and just to touch on the

184
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:51,279
biological well first off I want to say

185
00:07:48,038 --> 00:07:52,959
we seem to have different camps within

186
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:57,239
you know some of the more uh extreme

187
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:58,758
agonum Agronomy um theories where you

188
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,360
have people who've just focused solely

189
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:04,680
on BI ology and then you have people to

190
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,639
focus focus solely on Mineral balancing

191
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,800
um I guess you don't really see that so

192
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,840
much with on the sandil clay side but uh

193
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,280
it's it's interesting because they do

194
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:14,959
are are all so interrelated and one

195
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:16,799
thing that when you were talking it made

196
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:21,000
me think about is the fact that when we

197
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:23,918
think about uh biology and our soils

198
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,240
that soil is so diverse in any given

199
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:28,439
soil where there's pockets of Anor robic

200
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,840
activity pH is not constant throughout

201
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:32,240
the soil there's you know there's

202
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:35,439
different Pockets with different pH uh

203
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,680
throughout there that's created by the

204
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,240
biology by that you know air water

205
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:42,158
exchange you know we'll have the the

206
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,240
bacteria you know uh glomalin is

207
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:46,759
probably the most

208
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,080
uh known one to me in terms of the

209
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:50,958
bacteria forming glues and and and soil

210
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:54,639
Aggregates and and fungi doing the same

211
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:56,239
thing so it's a really complex process

212
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:58,159
um to think that we fully understand it

213
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,399
or even can really manage it on the

214
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:03,519
biological side I think is

215
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:05,559
um it might be a little bit arrogant on

216
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,078
our ends uh based on our current level

217
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:10,518
of

218
00:09:07,078 --> 00:09:13,439
knowledge sure and yeah I I actually I I

219
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:16,519
am constantly devouring content and I

220
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:19,959
would say that where I've landed is that

221
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:24,519
because of the infinite complexity of

222
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:27,319
the the soil biology that's primarily

223
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:29,600
dictated longterm all the sence shows

224
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:33,000
that it's D that that community de

225
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:36,320
composition is determined long-term by

226
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:39,919
physical and chemical characteristics pH

227
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:42,399
um you know gas exchange I I choose to

228
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:44,519
focus on optimizing and managing those

229
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,200
and I let the biology fall into place

230
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:49,799
now there are some really really

231
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:52,160
exciting new scientific techniques that

232
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:56,039
are um looking at soil

233
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:57,480
biology um genome sequencing is the one

234
00:09:56,039 --> 00:10:00,360
that comes to mind but there's a number

235
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:02,159
of other plfa and of other testing

236
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:05,440
techniques the problem with those is

237
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:07,439
that that the science and the scientists

238
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,560
that are really innovating in these

239
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,880
areas don't necessarily have targets

240
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:13,599
they don't know what they're striving

241
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:16,600
towards so even though it can be

242
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,560
measured it can't necessarily be managed

243
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,800
um and I I know a number of people would

244
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:24,039
disagree with me and I by all means I

245
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:27,278
think every approach um that is that is

246
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:30,078
biologically forward is positive yes but

247
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:31,720
as you know when I when I look at the

248
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:34,159
science and when I look at how to make

249
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:36,320
big management decisions I tend to to

250
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:39,958
believe that we should be doing things

251
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:42,639
that promote biological activity and

252
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:45,159
diversity but and and avoid those things

253
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:48,079
that don't and otherwise let nature go

254
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:51,679
through that complex process to Define

255
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:54,120
what that uh biological profile looks

256
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:56,399
like that being said we've come a long

257
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,600
way with bio stimulants just in the last

258
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,278
few years uh I know there's been a lot

259
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,440
of research worked done it's sort of an

260
00:11:00,278 --> 00:11:06,039
exciting New Field in a lot of ways to

261
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:07,880
replace this whole uh chemical mindset

262
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:11,319
mindset that we had coming out of uh

263
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:14,159
World War II um that would be

264
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:16,560
essentially be applying you know a very

265
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:19,240
specific set of microbes to create a

266
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:21,759
very specific you know interaction in

267
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:23,480
the soil with with positive outcomes how

268
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:25,078
does that fit into sort of your your

269
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:29,320
thoughts on all

270
00:11:25,078 --> 00:11:31,000
this yeah so I am really thrilled and

271
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:33,320
excited about the possibility of Bio

272
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,759
stimulants that aren't necessarily

273
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:38,600
active microbials but can also be

274
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:41,720
enzymes or various microbial exit dates

275
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:45,000
that produce a positive plant response

276
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:48,720
and I think there's a tremendous uh

277
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,720
opportunity there especially for um you

278
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:55,879
know late I I think of it as as sort of

279
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:58,879
a way to uh improve tpine profile and

280
00:11:55,879 --> 00:12:00,600
just general genetic expression aside

281
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:02,720
from yield so really getting to those

282
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,680
quality characteristics of cannabis I

283
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,839
will say though that biostimulants can't

284
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:09,599
replace nutrition because at the end of

285
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:11,560
the day plants need nutrients to grow

286
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,959
and a lot of these bio stimulants aren't

287
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:17,638
providing uh enough quantity of actual

288
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:19,679
nut nutrients to for the metabolic

289
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:21,839
function of plant so they're an amazing

290
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:23,000
addition to a nutritional program but

291
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,079
they don't they can't necessarily

292
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,519
replace it unless that soil already has

293
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:31,278
uh sufficient and balanced nutrition to

294
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:32,240
feed a a heavy feeding cannabis plant

295
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:33,720
yeah that's a good point they can't

296
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,959
create elements out of thin air they

297
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:38,720
need to be and they need to be

298
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:41,799
accessible to the the microorganisms as

299
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,240
in present in order for them to have any

300
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:44,759
real effect and I think that's an

301
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,360
important thing because the argument

302
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:47,919
I've heard from some of the people on

303
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:51,720
the biological side would be that all

304
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:54,679
soils have sufficient mineral levels

305
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:58,800
it's all about getting the uh

306
00:12:54,679 --> 00:13:01,120
microorganisms correct um however you

307
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:03,559
know I don't necessarily subscribe to

308
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,600
that do you have any thoughts in regards

309
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:10,000
to that as as a you know essentially a

310
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:11,839
rebuttal to this this idea of

311
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,159
mineralization yeah absolutely so

312
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:17,000
definitely not in the soiless media um

313
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:19,360
that that's just not uh the case now in

314
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,720
certain top soils sure in theory there

315
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:25,039
there's a lot of there's hundreds of

316
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:28,639
different hundreds or even you know a

317
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:31,078
thousand harvests theoretically however

318
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:34,759
we have to to keep in mind that we are

319
00:13:31,078 --> 00:13:37,399
mining nutrients cannabis is uptaking a

320
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:39,198
tremendous amount of nutrients and we're

321
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:43,039
exporting that off of our farm to

322
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:44,759
Consumers and uh crop after crop that is

323
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:47,559
depleted and I think specifically of

324
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:50,198
nitrogen and and potassium um those

325
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:52,518
nutrients drop out very very quickly in

326
00:13:50,198 --> 00:13:54,639
when you're yielding really heavy plants

327
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:56,839
of any annual for that matter or even

328
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:59,959
tree fruit um when you've

329
00:13:56,839 --> 00:14:03,320
Harvest uh peaches or apples that those

330
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:05,359
nutrients need to be replaced and uh

331
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:07,680
I've never experienced a grower in a in

332
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,600
a degraded soil or a marginalized soil

333
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:14,198
that hasn't that's gotten away with not

334
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:18,079
um applying nutrition uh season after

335
00:14:14,198 --> 00:14:20,799
season in a soilis media I it's it's um

336
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:22,278
there's just no way I mean the the the

337
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:24,159
quantity of nutrients in the soiless

338
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:26,039
media just isn't enough to sustain round

339
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:28,078
after round after round of heavy heavy

340
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:30,879
cropping and let's keep in mind too when

341
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:33,120
we're applying compost or compost te's

342
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:35,039
we're increasing nutrient cycling

343
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,519
through in you know if they're quality

344
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:39,439
let's say to uh we're increasing

345
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:41,519
nutrient cycling biological diversity

346
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,040
biological biomass but we're also giving

347
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,720
them a little bit of nitrogen and that

348
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:47,319
could be the limiting factor of growth

349
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,560
it may not necessarily be all these

350
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:51,639
microorganisms that are are really

351
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:53,159
helping when you're seeing results in

352
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:55,440
marginalized Souls it may be just a

353
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:57,759
little bit of n too I would

354
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,519
think absolutely and actually Tad I

355
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:01,519
think about this all the time and I

356
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:04,879
think about the great papers that you've

357
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:07,759
put out uh through kiss that that really

358
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:09,320
are um using experimental design to look

359
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:11,278
at these questions and I think this

360
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:13,800
would be an amazing one I don't know how

361
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:15,838
you would set up the experiment but um

362
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:20,240
to

363
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:23,920
identify if a the crop response to a te

364
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:26,360
or a canf for manage a Dom whatever is a

365
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:29,159
result of the microorganisms or the

366
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:31,560
nutrition because I've made teas with

367
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:32,639
Alfalfa and a number of different pretty

368
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:36,439
n

369
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:39,560
nutritious inputs and the output is a is

370
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:41,480
a fairly nutrient-rich tea and

371
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:43,278
oftentimes Growers report great crop

372
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,879
responses well we don't know the

373
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:47,318
function there we don't know the

374
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:48,759
mechanism to your point so I think that

375
00:15:47,318 --> 00:15:51,000
would be an amazing study and something

376
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:52,039
to look at um just so we know more

377
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,278
because I think knowledge and

378
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:56,078
information is power not necessarily to

379
00:15:54,278 --> 00:15:57,759
derail a certain school of thought but

380
00:15:56,078 --> 00:16:00,919
rather just so we have more information

381
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,919
to manage our systems

382
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,919
yeah so

383
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:06,120
mentally I totally agree with you on

384
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:09,318
that I think when we're talking about

385
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:10,959
plant Health uh and and soil you

386
00:16:09,318 --> 00:16:12,838
relative to soil Health we have to look

387
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:16,239
at what the limiting factor of growth is

388
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:18,440
for a plant is that the physical

389
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,759
properties of the soil is that some

390
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:23,440
particular mineral that's either uh in

391
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:25,120
excess or deficient um is it our

392
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,240
watering so that these nutrients are

393
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,799
available is it something in the

394
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,720
environment so figuring out what that

395
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:31,399
limiting factor of growth is because you

396
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,639
know I say this a lot in the podcast I

397
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:34,958
know this is something that you're quite

398
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,879
familiar with um we need to be really

399
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:39,239
strategic with what we're applying to

400
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:41,759
our soils into our plants it's not one a

401
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:43,399
silver bullet you know if your soil has

402
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:45,120
sufficient nitrogen don't put down a

403
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:47,000
nitrogen-rich product even if it was

404
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,839
that secret sauce that your buddy used

405
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,600
that made his crop turn out great it's

406
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:52,680
not it's not going to help and could

407
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,920
potentially be detrimental um which is

408
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:57,958
what which is kind of leads into this

409
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:59,198
idea of soil testing so um did you want

410
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:00,919
to add anything to that or you want to

411
00:16:59,198 --> 00:17:03,240
dive a little bit into soil

412
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:04,359
testing yeah let's dive right into it I

413
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,880
I I mean I agree with everything you're

414
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:08,599
saying I think Precision is is is the

415
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,919
key to nutrient management so let's

416
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:14,519
let's jump into it okay so when we talk

417
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:17,079
about soil testing um a lot of people I

418
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:18,798
think find it daunting uh understandably

419
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:20,318
so I think I would even say I'm one of

420
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:23,959
those people and as I looked into it

421
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:26,119
more and more I actually had less faith

422
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:29,320
in a lot of the numbers I was I was

423
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:33,959
reading um in terms of variability

424
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:36,960
and I also had um I had trouble making

425
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:39,038
actionable decisions based on a soil

426
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:43,038
test and here's where someone like you

427
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:44,640
comes in as as a really helpful uh you

428
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:46,599
know area of expertise someone that you

429
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,960
can rely on to help interpret these

430
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:51,359
tests but how do you utilize Soul

431
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:54,200
testing like how how as a grower can we

432
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:56,519
become more comfortable with these tests

433
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:58,840
too great well let me first just touch

434
00:17:56,519 --> 00:18:01,038
on variability because I know that

435
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:04,199
there's a lot of concern around that the

436
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:08,839
amount of soil that's used when running

437
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:11,279
a soil test I I um use Logan Labs

438
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:13,558
exclusively for the reason that all soil

439
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:15,639
tests and all soil labs are a little bit

440
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:19,319
different and so you have to stick to

441
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:21,360
the same uh lab to in order to make

442
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:23,918
sense and to order to in order to

443
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:25,199
establish targets that are useful so

444
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:28,919
that's really kind of an apples to

445
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:31,120
oranges industry which is unfortunate so

446
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:34,759
Logan uses you know a very small sample

447
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:36,359
size but and which sounds concerning on

448
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:38,558
when you first hear that but what I

449
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:43,519
found is that and I've looked at

450
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:46,759
thousands of of cannabis oils is

451
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:50,000
that the vast majority of the time the

452
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:51,599
the variability from sample to sample

453
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,319
does not actually change the ultimate

454
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:55,839
management decision so oftentimes

455
00:18:53,319 --> 00:18:58,158
Growers will send me 10 different tests

456
00:18:55,839 --> 00:19:03,038
maybe a test for every single baded in

457
00:18:58,159 --> 00:19:05,559
five different group houses and um the

458
00:19:03,038 --> 00:19:07,519
there's always variability um sometimes

459
00:19:05,558 --> 00:19:10,599
upwards of 30 parts per million between

460
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:14,158
samples but ultimately the same pattern

461
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:15,879
always exists across soils and in fact

462
00:19:14,159 --> 00:19:18,600
when it comes to top soils and a lot of

463
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:20,720
soiless media that's really homogeneous

464
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:23,119
the variability is is Tiny the first

465
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,880
time I uh worked on hazel nuts in the

466
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:27,759
wamit valley a really great grower uh

467
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,520
broke his farm into 10 different zones

468
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:34,919
and I was out there all day sampling

469
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:37,359
taking um extra careful precautions to

470
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:39,640
just make sure my sampling was rigorous

471
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:41,399
I I took multiple samples aggregated

472
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:44,159
into a single sample 10 different zones

473
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:47,960
it took me literally all day and the

474
00:19:44,159 --> 00:19:50,640
results came back and I was shocked at

475
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:52,679
how they were almost identical the

476
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,679
chemistry was almost identical across

477
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:56,320
all of these samples and I've seen that

478
00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:58,880
over and over and over again to the

479
00:19:56,319 --> 00:20:01,200
point where I believe that often times

480
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,960
Growers are over sampling and there's

481
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:07,038
just kind of a common rule of thumb to

482
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:08,720
to break your F into a bunch of samples

483
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:10,919
but the reality is most of my

484
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,159
recommendations are are almost identical

485
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:15,440
across all of those samples so to me the

486
00:20:13,159 --> 00:20:17,919
variability is less of a concern the

487
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:21,000
more I see this phenomenon does that

488
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:22,960
make sense it does I've sort of

489
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,319
experienced the same thing I would say

490
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,960
um what do you do though my my thought

491
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:29,319
goes to indoor cultivation with you know

492
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,480
soilless medum

493
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:36,038
or what a lot of people are calling

494
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:39,480
living soils um and uh crop differences

495
00:20:36,038 --> 00:20:41,839
across beds so let's say we had 20 beds

496
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:44,759
in a room and five of them are doing

497
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:47,558
poorly and five of them are doing really

498
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:49,919
well I you know how do you have people

499
00:20:47,558 --> 00:20:51,558
manage in in those situations in regards

500
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:54,280
to

501
00:20:51,558 --> 00:20:56,279
testing what are the cultivars the same

502
00:20:54,279 --> 00:20:57,678
in the thought experiment I mean rarely

503
00:20:56,279 --> 00:21:00,879
yeah let's say they're they're probably

504
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:05,280
not in a in a realistic

505
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:10,320
facility okay right um so that's the

506
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:13,918
first thing so I I what I do is I help

507
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:15,519
Growers get their soils in a target

508
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:18,120
range where the vast majority of

509
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:21,759
cultivars will do very very well however

510
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:24,319
we all know that there are significant

511
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:28,038
cultivar differences nutritional

512
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:30,879
requirements and so the best way to

513
00:21:28,038 --> 00:21:34,200
address that is to do to get your soil

514
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,960
in sufficiency and balance and to get it

515
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:38,440
close enough the goal is not Perfection

516
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:41,679
the close the the goal is to get it

517
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:44,038
toward improving levels and and then to

518
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:47,320
tissue test each individual cultivar and

519
00:21:44,038 --> 00:21:48,960
change your soil targets based on uh

520
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:50,480
this the the tissue results and I've

521
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,519
I've worked with a number of Growers on

522
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:55,960
this but to go back to your question if

523
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:58,839
I'm seeing differences in if there's

524
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:01,038
like if there's significant deficiency

525
00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:02,599
what that probably tells me is that all

526
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:04,400
the soil is out of whack but certain

527
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:06,839
cultivars are able to handle that

528
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:09,080
difference a little bit better so the

529
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:12,519
ones that are showing lower production

530
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:15,158
or uh deficiency symptoms are sort of

531
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:16,359
the canaries in the Coline in a sense um

532
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:18,480
that's one explanation the other

533
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:20,240
explanation is that the soil across that

534
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,679
Greenhouse isn't homogeneous and so what

535
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,440
I would do in that situation is I would

536
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:26,679
have uh the Growers sample from the poor

537
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:28,880
area and and the good area they could

538
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:31,559
either do two samples or four samples if

539
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:34,600
they just want to um again control for

540
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:36,599
that variability and usually what I

541
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:38,678
would see from my experience is that

542
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:40,319
that soil is again relatively similar

543
00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:42,159
it's showing the same pattern but

544
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:45,519
certain cultivars are able to hand

545
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:47,400
handle you know that high magnesium or

546
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:49,519
uh the low the lower phosphorus or

547
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:52,320
whatever it may be that's that's showing

548
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:54,918
up in the poor producing

549
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:56,519
plants now that you say that I'm kind of

550
00:22:54,919 --> 00:22:58,960
going thinking back in my head mentally

551
00:22:56,519 --> 00:23:01,119
to some of the tests I've seen and

552
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:03,120
that I find that to be fairly accurate

553
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:05,839
the one thing I'll see variability on is

554
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:08,239
usually nitrates and pH across when

555
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:10,639
someone will test let's say all of their

556
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,120
beds sort of thing individually those

557
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,720
are the two things that I find kind of

558
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:16,599
fluctuate and maybe that's just due to

559
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:19,240
the genetics in the bed um or maybe

560
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:22,000
their watering habits I don't know but

561
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:23,919
um I think N I agree with the nitrogen

562
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,640
the nitrogen thing is is extremely hard

563
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:28,080
to manage both in outdoor food

564
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:32,720
cultivation as well as in cannabis

565
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:34,519
indoor outdoor nitrogen is is I spend so

566
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,600
much time thinking about nitrogen

567
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:39,278
Management in organic production P it's

568
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:41,240
it's extremely difficult the I think you

569
00:23:39,278 --> 00:23:44,079
nailed it with watering you know if you

570
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:47,000
if you overwater one bed just a couple

571
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:49,678
of times even one time your nitrate is

572
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,200
extremely mobile so you're going to um

573
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,919
essentially flush out a little bit of

574
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,600
that nitrate so yeah the most

575
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:57,440
variability between beds I agree is is

576
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:59,359
usually in the

577
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,519
nitrogen do you want to talk a little

578
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:02,639
bit about nitrogen or do you want to

579
00:24:00,519 --> 00:24:04,918
dive into

580
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:09,880
water um let's chat about nitrogen I

581
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:12,600
mean I have a few thoughts on nitrogen

582
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:14,799
um there's the like I said it's

583
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:18,278
extremely mobile and I think Growers

584
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:20,519
should keep in mind uh that it's removed

585
00:24:18,278 --> 00:24:25,240
from the soil at the highest quantity

586
00:24:20,519 --> 00:24:29,440
that nitrogen and and potassium are um

587
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:32,200
are removed in in cannabis production

588
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:34,960
in the highest quantity so in a soil the

589
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:38,519
first thing that's going to become

590
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:42,200
deficient is is going to be nitrogen and

591
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:44,200
potassium and specifically uh nitrogen

592
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,600
you know the the tissue Target for

593
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:49,399
nitrogen is is anywhere from three and a

594
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:53,119
half to 5% of the leaf tissue that's a

595
00:24:49,398 --> 00:24:54,759
lot um there's no other nutrient

596
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:57,278
actually I take that back calcium is

597
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:59,398
also removed upwards in the 3 to 5%

598
00:24:57,278 --> 00:25:01,839
range so that the first thing to keep in

599
00:24:59,398 --> 00:25:05,359
mind is that is that you really have to

600
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:07,720
have a way to replenish nitrogen um

601
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:10,319
round after round otherwise you'll start

602
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:13,399
to see issues the issue with nitrogen is

603
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:15,439
that um I see it kind of like a gas tank

604
00:25:13,398 --> 00:25:17,918
and so Logan tests for available

605
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:21,558
nitrogen which is defined as ammonium

606
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:24,880
plus nitrate and ammonium will always be

607
00:25:21,558 --> 00:25:26,798
low as long as the soil uh as long as

608
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,760
the organic Amendments have have fully

609
00:25:26,798 --> 00:25:30,519
mineralized um it should be about less

610
00:25:28,759 --> 00:25:31,960
than one or two parts per million so the

611
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:34,480
nitrate number is really the important

612
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:36,720
one to look at and I see that as sort of

613
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:39,278
a gas tank but the issue is if you put

614
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,839
too much in you start to have crop

615
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:44,720
quality issues you start to call in

616
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:48,319
pests and disease uh fungal pressure

617
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:51,120
I've noticed a decrease in flavor and

618
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:55,000
aroma so it it messes with the

619
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:57,359
tpin and in general I believe it it it

620
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,480
can produce kind of a a lower density

621
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:02,798
flower quality and it it just causes

622
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,960
issues however the minute the plant runs

623
00:26:02,798 --> 00:26:06,440
out of

624
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:08,640
nitrogen so many of the metabolic

625
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,360
functions stop so the physiology the

626
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:15,600
growth the flower development it really

627
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:17,158
is the fuel um in plant growth so the

628
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:19,879
final thing I want to mention is it's in

629
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:23,880
soil signs it's ephemeral so it's it's

630
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:25,679
uh mobile it changes very quickly and

631
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:27,919
there's there's not an easy way to get

632
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:29,640
an accurate accurate portrayal of how

633
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,320
much nitrogen you have because that

634
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:33,399
nitrate number is so fragile it's

635
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:35,038
bouncing all over the place all the time

636
00:26:33,398 --> 00:26:39,239
so to me that's the most challenging

637
00:26:35,038 --> 00:26:41,359
thing to uh manage and I believe you

638
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:43,038
know the Growers I've seen who get

639
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:45,479
consistently you know three pounds per

640
00:26:43,038 --> 00:26:47,759
light or however you want to measure it

641
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:49,399
grams per watt they are actually running

642
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:51,519
their nitrogen a little bit lower but

643
00:26:49,398 --> 00:26:54,479
they're feeding they're feeding soluble

644
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:56,720
amino acid nitrogen through the cycle

645
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,759
and that allows for that quality to

646
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,240
remain really high but you have to be

647
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:02,919
really careful you never run out of

648
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,480
nitrogen at any point in the process

649
00:27:02,919 --> 00:27:07,799
obviously you can let it draw down

650
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:09,679
lateen flour but um that's the essence

651
00:27:07,798 --> 00:27:12,038
that you see the plant still has enough

652
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:15,080
of it it's just translocating it from

653
00:27:12,038 --> 00:27:17,119
its older leaves into the parts of the

654
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:18,038
plant that are still growing so I know

655
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:20,439
that was kind of a stream of

656
00:27:18,038 --> 00:27:22,000
Consciousness but um that was great

657
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:25,679
those are kind of my my high level

658
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:28,240
thoughts on nitrogen management yeah so

659
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:32,080
one one question I have based off of so

660
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:35,278
I'll use the the mik 3 test to look at

661
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:37,759
nitrates and when I I've seen some tests

662
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:40,558
you know really high I aim for around

663
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:44,000
100 to 120 pounds per acre kind of in

664
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:46,038
that corn range for nitrogen um but I've

665
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,759
seen tests double and triple that

666
00:27:46,038 --> 00:27:51,599
sometimes um what's sort of your target

667
00:27:48,759 --> 00:27:53,640
with n nitrate and and how do you manage

668
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:55,278
it when it is really high because you

669
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:58,278
mentioned it is so ephemeral do you not

670
00:27:55,278 --> 00:28:01,319
worry about that as long as your visual

671
00:27:58,278 --> 00:28:03,440
crop response looks

672
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:06,119
good yeah

673
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:10,840
so um

674
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:12,678
I my nitrogen Target changes based on

675
00:28:10,839 --> 00:28:16,240
how long the plants are going to be in

676
00:28:12,679 --> 00:28:18,640
that soil so if it's a full-term crop or

677
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:22,159
um if it's just for flour for example I

678
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:24,080
mean more and more it's transplanted in

679
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:26,000
it's in veg for one to three weeks and

680
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:28,480
then flipped into flow yeah I always

681
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,480
think of it as just a flower just

682
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:33,038
mentally I'm for this let's just think

683
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:35,079
of it in in flowers and it's a

684
00:28:33,038 --> 00:28:37,158
transplanting into the soil as a

685
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:41,798
flowering

686
00:28:37,159 --> 00:28:44,360
soil okay so so in that case um and I

687
00:28:41,798 --> 00:28:49,639
just want to mention that that pot Size

688
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:51,639
Matters of course and the form the am

689
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:56,360
the the the release rate of whatever

690
00:28:51,640 --> 00:29:01,519
nitrogen matters but in general um for

691
00:28:56,359 --> 00:29:05,398
flour I aim for for 150 pounds per acre

692
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:07,558
so um very similar to you but the P to

693
00:29:05,398 --> 00:29:09,639
just make it more complicated I do some

694
00:29:07,558 --> 00:29:11,319
complicated math on on the pounds per

695
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:13,640
acre because we're converting something

696
00:29:11,319 --> 00:29:16,519
that's very agronomic top soil in nature

697
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:19,559
and putting it into a soiless media in

698
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:22,759
um cubic yards so I still use that

699
00:29:19,558 --> 00:29:26,359
metric but it's it's adulterated so in

700
00:29:22,759 --> 00:29:28,398
general I'm looking for about 75 PPM I

701
00:29:26,359 --> 00:29:30,918
think that's a good level to you know

702
00:29:28,398 --> 00:29:33,759
going into flour and then any remaining

703
00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:36,600
nitrogen you may need um you can always

704
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:40,519
apply later the goal to me is to is to

705
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:42,278
end it down near 20 or 30 um not too low

706
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:45,480
so it's completely deficient but not too

707
00:29:42,278 --> 00:29:48,159
high where it's it's affecting your flow

708
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:51,278
quality Yeah you mentioned uh nitrogen

709
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:53,320
in an amino acid form what sort of

710
00:29:51,278 --> 00:29:55,960
amendments or products are are you

711
00:29:53,319 --> 00:30:00,079
finding people are using effectively to

712
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:02,480
get that nitrogen in in small

713
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:06,599
doses yeah I would say

714
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:09,440
soluble amino acids derived from soybean

715
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:13,398
meal um that's that's my favorite that's

716
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:16,000
my go-to is a is a soluble soybean meal

717
00:30:13,398 --> 00:30:18,918
um amino acid I know a lot of people use

718
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,159
uh aminos from fish which I'm sure are

719
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:22,399
just as good um I don't I don't have an

720
00:30:21,159 --> 00:30:25,440
opinion or a preference one way or

721
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:28,479
another um I think the idea being that

722
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:32,159
in in the plant nitr

723
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:35,558
is converted into complete proteins in

724
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:38,039
the leaves through a pathway called the

725
00:30:35,558 --> 00:30:39,240
nitrate reductase pathway it's a really

726
00:30:38,038 --> 00:30:41,398
interesting thing that Google if you

727
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:43,679
find it on Wikipedia it just shows the

728
00:30:41,398 --> 00:30:47,158
complexity of plant physiology but it it

729
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:49,720
requires miminum as the enzyme co-actor

730
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:52,519
that converts nitrate um into complete

731
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:54,798
proteins this process metabolically is

732
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:57,120
extremely taxing on the plant it's I've

733
00:30:54,798 --> 00:30:59,918
read that it takes upwards of 18% of the

734
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:01,918
plant's total photosynthetic energy to

735
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:06,278
convert nitrates into complete protein

736
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:09,960
so the theory behind amino acids is that

737
00:31:06,278 --> 00:31:12,638
you are giving the plant the building

738
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:15,038
blocks for protein and therefore it

739
00:31:12,638 --> 00:31:17,519
doesn't have to convert that nitrate and

740
00:31:15,038 --> 00:31:18,558
it saves a tremendous amount of energy

741
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:22,440
let's just say

742
00:31:18,558 --> 00:31:25,440
18% um just for over

743
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:28,639
simplification and the plant then has

744
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:32,120
18% more energy to

745
00:31:28,638 --> 00:31:34,879
devote or allocate toward other uh plant

746
00:31:32,119 --> 00:31:37,599
growth functions or root exitation and I

747
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:40,639
just think you know 18% more energy

748
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:44,558
every single day I would do anything for

749
00:31:40,638 --> 00:31:47,918
that me too uh so what what kind of

750
00:31:44,558 --> 00:31:50,638
product are you finding make this uh soy

751
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:53,000
based amino

752
00:31:50,638 --> 00:31:54,918
acid thing I haven't I haven't heard of

753
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,240
you mean brand yeah is there like a

754
00:31:54,919 --> 00:31:58,840
particular product or brand that that

755
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:01,839
you could throw out there for listeners

756
00:31:58,839 --> 00:32:03,398
to maybe check out sure sure I hate

757
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:05,038
naming Brands because I try to be

758
00:32:03,398 --> 00:32:09,558
product agnostic but I'll do it fair

759
00:32:05,038 --> 00:32:12,519
enough fair enough um agino is a is one

760
00:32:09,558 --> 00:32:14,599
uh there's one ferin Nitro that's a

761
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:17,679
great one

762
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:21,359
um and

763
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:24,960
I yeah there's there's a another good

764
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:28,918
one um grower secret

765
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:30,639
n um

766
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:33,038
okay yeah those are the three that come

767
00:32:30,638 --> 00:32:35,398
to mind yeah I've been using a product

768
00:32:33,038 --> 00:32:37,278
called moch Chum uh from plant success

769
00:32:35,398 --> 00:32:41,278
because it has n and K

770
00:32:37,278 --> 00:32:42,319
specifically um but I am totally open to

771
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:45,119
maybe that's something I need to look

772
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:48,240
into is offering to our customers on

773
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:51,879
kiss Organics is a soy based one too so

774
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:55,200
I yeah absolutely appreciate abolutely

775
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:57,320
um yeah okay so we talked about nitrogen

776
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:00,840
and uh did you want to talk about

777
00:32:57,319 --> 00:33:03,000
potassium or do you want to dive into

778
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:06,879
water let's talk about pottassium real

779
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:10,038
quick all right I I can't resist so

780
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:12,639
potassium is an interesting one because

781
00:33:10,038 --> 00:33:14,759
um well and and let me connect it to

782
00:33:12,638 --> 00:33:15,678
nitrogen really quickly there's a number

783
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:18,000
of products there's a number of

784
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:20,360
amendments but at the end of the day I

785
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:24,000
believe that compost is the winner when

786
00:33:20,359 --> 00:33:27,959
it comes to a slow relasing source of

787
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:30,480
both nitrogen and pottassium and and um

788
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:34,079
that's nothing new you know the best

789
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:35,759
organic Growers were were uh using

790
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:37,720
compost well before I was born so

791
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:39,720
compost is is key the the trick with

792
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:42,000
soiless media in cannabis production is

793
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:43,960
all compost is so different in quality

794
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,079
and so different in nutrient profile and

795
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:47,840
it has such a differing amount of sodium

796
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:49,439
and salts that it's really easy to

797
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:52,678
overdo compost so it's really a

798
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:54,679
balancing act so my belief is that um

799
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:57,320
once you get your base mix once you

800
00:33:54,679 --> 00:34:00,080
build your soil or buy your kiss soil or

801
00:33:57,319 --> 00:34:01,960
whatever may be the the trick there is

802
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:03,158
to apply just a little bit of compost

803
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:06,120
every single season or every single

804
00:34:03,159 --> 00:34:08,200
round because compost doesn't release

805
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:09,799
all of its nutrition in year one it

806
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:11,598
continues to release it forever so

807
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:13,440
you're just sort of it's almost like

808
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:14,720
saving money every year you're putting a

809
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,358
little bit more money in the bank

810
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:18,398
account that's going to spit out

811
00:34:16,358 --> 00:34:21,000
dividends or interest every single year

812
00:34:18,398 --> 00:34:23,000
thereafter and that really mitigates the

813
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:26,960
nitrogen and and pottassium

814
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:28,838
um mining that I referred to earlier

815
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:31,320
Okay so

816
00:34:28,838 --> 00:34:32,159
otherwise the only you know good sources

817
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:36,280
of

818
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:38,639
potassium um you know there's

819
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:41,480
there's potassium sulfate there's

820
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:44,519
potassium silicate there's green sand

821
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:48,519
there's wood ash uh I know a lot of like

822
00:34:44,519 --> 00:34:50,280
KF guys will will use sunflower Ash I

823
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:51,800
don't like ash because it concentrates

824
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,399
all salt so just because it has high

825
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:56,919
pottassium you're bringing in a bunch of

826
00:34:53,398 --> 00:34:58,118
other stuff um and so and and those so

827
00:34:56,918 --> 00:35:00,279
potassium sulfate and pottassium

828
00:34:58,119 --> 00:35:03,200
silicate those are both highly soluble

829
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:06,680
they're soluble at about 420 gram per

830
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:08,399
gallon of water so um compared to gypsum

831
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:10,719
that's only let's say eight grams per

832
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,280
gallon in its solubility so that

833
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:14,078
solubility is great because you can feed

834
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:16,560
it and you can you can you know dissolve

835
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:18,760
it in water and Drench it let's say

836
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:21,559
through flour but it also means that

837
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:23,640
it's it's soluble in the soil and that

838
00:35:21,559 --> 00:35:25,400
it can leech out it's it remains in the

839
00:35:23,639 --> 00:35:28,639
soil solution it doesn't necessarily

840
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:30,119
cling to uh the organic comp lexes like

841
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:31,598
uh let's say copper that's on the other

842
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:35,200
end of the spectrum it's extremely

843
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:38,079
sticky so pottassium you're not only not

844
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:41,399
only is the plant of picking it a lot of

845
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:45,039
it through the entire plant growth stage

846
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:48,000
but it's also Le very leech in in the

847
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:50,559
soil solution so um I found that

848
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,559
potassium is an interesting one because

849
00:35:50,559 --> 00:35:54,679
you it's it's and this isn't new to most

850
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:56,639
folks but it's incredibly important for

851
00:35:54,679 --> 00:36:00,000
for flower development flower

852
00:35:56,639 --> 00:36:02,598
sizing flow density hardness as people

853
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,159
like to refer to it I density yeah that

854
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:07,838
weight if you want to get that weight on

855
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:10,920
your flower um you need so much of yield

856
00:36:07,838 --> 00:36:14,078
depends on that

857
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:15,519
yes so it's a hard one to manage and on

858
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:16,839
the other end of the spectrum I don't

859
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:19,759
believe you want to push too much

860
00:36:16,838 --> 00:36:22,239
potassium in in veg because potassium

861
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,400
and calcium are highly antagonistic in

862
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:25,719
both their uptake and their

863
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:28,280
translocation around the plant so I

864
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:29,439
found and from talking to really good

865
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,720
Growers again who are getting

866
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,159
consistently high yields is that you

867
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:34,439
really want to you really want to push

868
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:36,039
calcium in veg and load your plant with

869
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:38,720
calcium because that sets you up for a

870
00:36:36,039 --> 00:36:41,318
really good harvest but you want to flip

871
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:43,039
the script in in flour and just make

872
00:36:41,318 --> 00:36:44,960
sure you're getting enough potassium so

873
00:36:43,039 --> 00:36:47,679
there's a balancing act between those

874
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:50,199
two minerals and I think the key is um

875
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:52,318
it makes it easier to to either have a

876
00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:54,159
lot of fresh compost in the mix that's

877
00:36:52,318 --> 00:36:56,519
constantly releasing pottassium or you

878
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:58,358
really do want to feed um potassium

879
00:36:56,519 --> 00:37:00,559
through flour that's that's my general

880
00:36:58,358 --> 00:37:03,039
rule of

881
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:04,559
thumb yeah so that leaves us with sort

882
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:08,000
of pottassium

883
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:10,799
sulfate or potassium silicate um

884
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,440
potassium silicate would be the egg sill

885
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,880
16h a lot of people know dagro protect

886
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:19,358
which is essentially a a bottled watered

887
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:22,800
version of that potassium silicate

888
00:37:19,358 --> 00:37:26,519
um potassium silicates allowed for use

889
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:29,359
in organic production um as I believe as

890
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:31,800
a pesticide is that correct Suzanne

891
00:37:29,358 --> 00:37:33,519
would kill me for not uh knowing this

892
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:36,000
off hand um I don't believe it's allowed

893
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:39,519
to be used as a fertility management

894
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:42,920
tool though I think many PE many folks

895
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:45,679
do are you talking potassium silicate

896
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:47,400
yes you know I'm not sure I've only

897
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:49,159
recently started recommending it because

898
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:51,680
so many people are using it I've always

899
00:37:49,159 --> 00:37:54,519
used pottassium sulfate um and I've only

900
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:57,159
recently switched over so I I didn't I

901
00:37:54,519 --> 00:37:59,280
was not aware of that okay well I can I

902
00:37:57,159 --> 00:38:01,598
can go look over that with it but I'm

903
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,359
fairly confident that that's that's

904
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:06,760
right but you know people can fact check

905
00:38:03,358 --> 00:38:08,960
me on that one um that being said the

906
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:13,280
potassium sulfate uh is something that I

907
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:15,639
use as well it's a mind product um 50%

908
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:17,680
pottassium it's a really easy way to get

909
00:38:15,639 --> 00:38:19,199
and a very affordable way to get

910
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:21,519
potassium into your

911
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:23,078
soil uh when we need to get that little

912
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:25,800
boost but I totally agree with you about

913
00:38:23,079 --> 00:38:28,359
compost um let's go back and we keep

914
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:30,359
skipping skipping around water but you

915
00:38:28,358 --> 00:38:32,159
keep bringing up these great topics like

916
00:38:30,358 --> 00:38:36,559
you mentioned you know not all composts

917
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:38,679
are the same it all has different uh all

918
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:41,679
varying levels of minerals of heavy

919
00:38:38,679 --> 00:38:43,879
metals of nutrients all these things um

920
00:38:41,679 --> 00:38:45,919
of microbial activity the other thing

921
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:47,079
about compost or the other thing about

922
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,400
this process that I want to highlight

923
00:38:47,079 --> 00:38:51,560
that you touched on was um every time we

924
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:54,318
Harvest a plant this is not a closed

925
00:38:51,559 --> 00:38:56,078
system you're pulling out nutrients and

926
00:38:54,318 --> 00:38:57,880
you're pulling out organic matter and

927
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:59,599
that's what compost replaces it really

928
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:02,000
helps get that organic matter fraction

929
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:03,920
back up too and if you're adding back in

930
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,039
compost at some point in time you may

931
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:09,200
need to add back in irration so um or

932
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:10,880
some sort of like yes thing to maintain

933
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:12,639
that air to water ratio that we want

934
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:15,680
that gas exchange that you highlighted

935
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:18,118
so I just wanted to kind of highlight

936
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:19,358
that one more time but um let's talk a

937
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:21,400
little bit about compost you know you

938
00:39:19,358 --> 00:39:23,519
said what's what is good versus bad

939
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:25,200
compost how do we evaluate compost and

940
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:27,639
that could be a whole podcast I know but

941
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:29,159
let's just do a quick little thing on it

942
00:39:27,639 --> 00:39:31,039
and then maybe we can have a whole

943
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:33,559
podcast on it down the

944
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:36,480
road okay great well I'd like to chime

945
00:39:33,559 --> 00:39:38,440
in well one thing and I'm have a lot of

946
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,240
to say on compost but to take a step

947
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:43,639
back when you're people live running

948
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:46,239
living soil beds that are on round 20 or

949
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:48,559
10 even what's happening is that that

950
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:51,000
organic matter is

951
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:54,039
mineralizing and the usually the bulk

952
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,639
density goes up in that mix um and

953
00:39:54,039 --> 00:39:57,440
especially as more compost is added to

954
00:39:55,639 --> 00:39:59,719
your point and I've never seen one of

955
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:03,240
these beds that doesn't have worms in it

956
00:39:59,719 --> 00:40:05,000
so by around 20 I think those beds have

957
00:40:03,239 --> 00:40:06,679
pretty much turned to worm castings

958
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,960
which isn't a bad thing worm castings

959
00:40:06,679 --> 00:40:11,480
are magical in so many ways but the but

960
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:15,318
to your point I really think it's

961
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:17,920
important to be adding more aggregate

962
00:40:15,318 --> 00:40:19,920
because when the bulk density increases

963
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:22,079
of your soiless media it really changes

964
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,639
a lot of the the water holding capacity

965
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:25,000
and drainage characteristics so either

966
00:40:23,639 --> 00:40:28,279
you have to adjust your irrigation

967
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:31,719
technique or increase aggregate so I'm I

968
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:33,400
I agree 100% Tad okay when it comes to

969
00:40:31,719 --> 00:40:35,759
compost

970
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:40,039
um here's here's how I would Define a

971
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:42,440
good compost well aged so uh usually

972
00:40:40,039 --> 00:40:45,639
that's indicated in two different ways

973
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:48,280
one is through the ammonium to nitrate

974
00:40:45,639 --> 00:40:50,199
ratio so you want lower ammonium compost

975
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:53,079
that usually means that it's fairly

976
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:55,118
mature and the second way is do the

977
00:40:53,079 --> 00:40:56,680
carbon to nitrogen ratio which I think

978
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:59,000
maybe the most important thing when

979
00:40:56,679 --> 00:41:01,679
looking at a compost ability to provide

980
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:04,119
nitrogen to your crop yes so and to not

981
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:07,719
immobilize nitrogen because when the the

982
00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:12,800
carbon and nitrogen ratio goes over

983
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:14,480
about 18 to 22 to one right in that

984
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:18,480
range I know that's a relatively large

985
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:20,039
range but um I I my rule of thumb is 18

986
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:22,079
to one when it's greater than that you

987
00:41:20,039 --> 00:41:23,800
shouldn't you shouldn't count on any

988
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:26,480
nitrogen release from that compost in

989
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:29,480
year one and in fact when it's above 20

990
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:31,838
you could actually see um a nitrogen

991
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:33,679
draw where those microbes need nitrogen

992
00:41:31,838 --> 00:41:35,639
to break down the carbon and they they

993
00:41:33,679 --> 00:41:36,879
steal that nitrogen from your crop so I

994
00:41:35,639 --> 00:41:39,279
think that's the first really important

995
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:41,838
thing to look at

996
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:45,880
the the next thing that I look at is

997
00:41:41,838 --> 00:41:47,920
sodium and salt so in the Arid West um

998
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:50,559
anywhere where they're making compost

999
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:52,280
out of high salinity feed stock or the

1000
00:41:50,559 --> 00:41:56,039
water that they use to keep the compost

1001
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:58,680
moist is you know high in bicarbonates

1002
00:41:56,039 --> 00:42:01,838
you can start to see uh salinity buildup

1003
00:41:58,679 --> 00:42:04,598
in compost which is uh going to to

1004
00:42:01,838 --> 00:42:07,358
import a lot of of negative ions into

1005
00:42:04,599 --> 00:42:10,160
your um soil and by negative I don't

1006
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:13,000
mean negatively charged I mean

1007
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:16,879
um poor for plant

1008
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:19,920
growth and the next thing I look at is

1009
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:23,358
the total nitrogen phosphorus and

1010
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:25,318
pottassium on a wet basis or as received

1011
00:42:23,358 --> 00:42:28,000
is how this little on the compost test

1012
00:42:25,318 --> 00:42:31,358
look at it just so I have a sense of if

1013
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:35,599
it's on the hotter end of things or um

1014
00:42:31,358 --> 00:42:37,119
if it's more of a inert organic matter

1015
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:39,079
source that may not be providing a lot

1016
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:43,480
of nitrogen so usually hot nitrogens

1017
00:42:39,079 --> 00:42:47,200
come from um chicken uh chicken manure

1018
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:49,240
other uh poultry manure as well as

1019
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:51,799
castings that have been fed you know a

1020
00:42:49,239 --> 00:42:53,759
really rich diet I sometimes see really

1021
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:56,640
high nitrogen numbers in different

1022
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:58,440
castings um and I tend to avoid mushroom

1023
00:42:56,639 --> 00:43:00,480
compost because I tend to see really

1024
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:03,280
high sodium and salinity for mushroom

1025
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:05,000
composts um I love manure so I love

1026
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,240
manure-based compost especially Cal

1027
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:10,079
manure horse

1028
00:43:06,239 --> 00:43:12,358
manure goat sheep anything any uh ulate

1029
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:14,240
like that usually has a really good

1030
00:43:12,358 --> 00:43:16,199
manure that's not it doesn't provide a

1031
00:43:14,239 --> 00:43:19,879
lot of nutrition but again it's giving a

1032
00:43:16,199 --> 00:43:22,318
lot of that um kind of slow release

1033
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:24,440
organic matter the final thing is a a

1034
00:43:22,318 --> 00:43:28,480
fungal Rich compost from from what I've

1035
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:30,960
heard and read is is um

1036
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,679
typically very very beneficial and so

1037
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,559
there's something called the Johnson Sue

1038
00:43:32,679 --> 00:43:36,919
bioreactor that that I think your

1039
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:40,119
listeners should check out it's a very

1040
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:43,480
simple um self-sufficient way to produce

1041
00:43:40,119 --> 00:43:47,800
a really high quality highly fungal and

1042
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:49,800
very well uh broken down and aged

1043
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:51,318
compost so I'll leave it at that do you

1044
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:53,680
have any

1045
00:43:51,318 --> 00:43:54,920
thoughts I mean I I think right you

1046
00:43:53,679 --> 00:43:57,558
touched at it right at the beginning

1047
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:59,519
well-aged like nothing beats time

1048
00:43:57,559 --> 00:44:01,720
in Mother Nature when it comes to making

1049
00:43:59,519 --> 00:44:03,679
compost and I think the majority of

1050
00:44:01,719 --> 00:44:05,959
commercial composts that we see are just

1051
00:44:03,679 --> 00:44:08,440
produced way too rapidly to optimize

1052
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:10,800
plant growth um that's that's probably

1053
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:13,760
my biggest takeaway find make your own

1054
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:16,760
compost let it static composting is by

1055
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:18,880
far the best way to make high quality

1056
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:20,880
compost you know thermally compost at

1057
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,960
first kill off the pathogens weed seeds

1058
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,599
sure but um that would be the one thing

1059
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:28,318
i' I'd say so I totally agree with you

1060
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:31,119
on that great uh the other

1061
00:44:28,318 --> 00:44:34,719
thing I I would say to all of that would

1062
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:37,680
be um I haven't had the best experience

1063
00:44:34,719 --> 00:44:40,159
with cow manure-based composts relative

1064
00:44:37,679 --> 00:44:43,759
to some of the other manures I I much

1065
00:44:40,159 --> 00:44:45,279
prefer horse manure over cow manure um

1066
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:47,880
but

1067
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:50,079
uh you in general I think manure-based

1068
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:52,440
composts are are wonderful if you if

1069
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:53,839
properly managed um I would I would

1070
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:55,800
totally agree with you on that I just I

1071
00:44:53,838 --> 00:44:58,358
find the fertility on calure compost to

1072
00:44:55,800 --> 00:45:02,880
be prettyy poor um in general it's

1073
00:44:58,358 --> 00:45:04,799
pretty low yeah it's pretty low but um

1074
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:06,680
yeah no I think that's great and so when

1075
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:09,318
people say add compost that I don't

1076
00:45:06,679 --> 00:45:11,440
think that really captures what you um

1077
00:45:09,318 --> 00:45:14,358
what you need to know like if uh there

1078
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:16,119
there's so much more to it than that um

1079
00:45:14,358 --> 00:45:18,119
I'm thinking of just you know on a forum

1080
00:45:16,119 --> 00:45:20,440
for example people say hey add earthworm

1081
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:23,519
castings add compost but that doesn't

1082
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:25,519
take into account the quality or the

1083
00:45:23,519 --> 00:45:28,079
nutrient levels or the biological

1084
00:45:25,519 --> 00:45:30,800
activity and whatever it is they adding

1085
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:32,880
so it kind of goes it's my biggest issue

1086
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:35,920
with with with

1087
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:39,880
recipes soil recipes

1088
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:42,200
are uh they're garbage in my opinion uh

1089
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:45,079
because the the if you're if you're

1090
00:45:42,199 --> 00:45:48,439
mixing Coots mix for example the compost

1091
00:45:45,079 --> 00:45:51,839
you'd be applying in the wamit valley

1092
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:56,240
versus the compost you'd be applying in

1093
00:45:51,838 --> 00:45:57,558
Oklahoma or Nevada or Colorado is so

1094
00:45:56,239 --> 00:45:59,959
it's the difference

1095
00:45:57,559 --> 00:46:01,400
between eating a salad and eating

1096
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:03,400
McDonald's I mean it's just it's just

1097
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:07,838
night and day in terms of what you're

1098
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:11,119
contributing to the soil so you can take

1099
00:46:07,838 --> 00:46:13,719
the same soil recipe and create a a

1100
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:15,200
nearly ideal soil and with the same

1101
00:46:13,719 --> 00:46:16,558
recipe you can create something that's

1102
00:46:15,199 --> 00:46:18,719
complete

1103
00:46:16,559 --> 00:46:22,240
garbage that's a really good point and

1104
00:46:18,719 --> 00:46:24,318
even uh cot himself has said multiple

1105
00:46:22,239 --> 00:46:27,118
times you're not making cute mix because

1106
00:46:24,318 --> 00:46:28,599
you don't have my earthworm castings um

1107
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:31,039
which would speak exactly to what you're

1108
00:46:28,599 --> 00:46:33,000
saying so it's a good point when people

1109
00:46:31,039 --> 00:46:36,199
have you know successes or failures with

1110
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:38,920
recipes um I think that's I think that's

1111
00:46:36,199 --> 00:46:40,960
exactly true and then the other the only

1112
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:43,318
other thing I would add is that I like

1113
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:45,440
to do some level of biological testing

1114
00:46:43,318 --> 00:46:47,599
even if that's qualitative when I look

1115
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:49,880
at a compost I want to see under a

1116
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:52,000
microscope what sort of microorganism

1117
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:54,599
activity I'm getting you know do I see

1118
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:57,079
good diversity um in terms of the

1119
00:46:54,599 --> 00:46:59,559
morphology of organisms I'm seeing am I

1120
00:46:57,079 --> 00:47:01,760
getting good biomass uh that's what I

1121
00:46:59,559 --> 00:47:05,519
like to look at as well um what kind of

1122
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:08,720
nematodes am I seeing um in in the mix

1123
00:47:05,519 --> 00:47:10,519
so yeah I other than that though it's a

1124
00:47:08,719 --> 00:47:11,558
great idea I agree with you on the

1125
00:47:10,519 --> 00:47:13,280
compost thing I don't think everyone has

1126
00:47:11,559 --> 00:47:16,400
to have a microscope I think it's the

1127
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:17,559
least useful of all the agronomic tools

1128
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,720
I can't believe I'm saying that on the

1129
00:47:17,559 --> 00:47:21,400
air but I I I really do believe that

1130
00:47:19,719 --> 00:47:24,199
when people ask me buy a microscope I'm

1131
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:26,318
like oh you know what get a get a dino

1132
00:47:24,199 --> 00:47:28,759
light first or some way to look for pest

1133
00:47:26,318 --> 00:47:31,400
or get a dissolved oxygen meter or you

1134
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:33,160
know a pH pen or these other things

1135
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:37,119
first and then if you want to start

1136
00:47:33,159 --> 00:47:38,558
getting a microscope great but yeah yeah

1137
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:40,358
people might people might eat you up for

1138
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:43,000
that one i' I'd recommend a pulse meter

1139
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:45,279
and I'd also recommend a an neurometer

1140
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:47,639
tensometer yes BL M sells them too I'm

1141
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:48,880
sure you could bu but but I think my my

1142
00:47:47,639 --> 00:47:52,440
two favorite

1143
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:54,358
tools um well I have some more advanced

1144
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:56,240
tools but if I were to recommend my two

1145
00:47:54,358 --> 00:47:58,838
favorite for the average grow be a pulse

1146
00:47:56,239 --> 00:47:58,838
meter and a

1147
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:03,240
tensometer I think if you're going to do

1148
00:48:00,639 --> 00:48:06,358
a lot of soil testing too having just a

1149
00:48:03,239 --> 00:48:11,199
you know a very affordable uh soil

1150
00:48:06,358 --> 00:48:13,279
sampler um I think is is really an easy

1151
00:48:11,199 --> 00:48:16,118
easy

1152
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:17,720
buy that's true the only thing is I have

1153
00:48:16,119 --> 00:48:19,680
a really expensive probe I use it all

1154
00:48:17,719 --> 00:48:23,598
the time of course but it doesn't

1155
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:26,118
necessarily always uh jab into soiless

1156
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:28,599
media that well yeah sometimes I end up

1157
00:48:26,119 --> 00:48:30,880
using a TR anyway yeah I do like a trial

1158
00:48:28,599 --> 00:48:33,760
for slor lless media um I would agree

1159
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:36,160
with that too that's a good point so

1160
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:37,880
okay let's talk about uh let's talk

1161
00:48:36,159 --> 00:48:40,078
about water because it's something that

1162
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:42,680
frankly I don't have as much experience

1163
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:44,440
and knowledge with um as I would like I

1164
00:48:42,679 --> 00:48:47,358
always tell people to test their water

1165
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:49,119
so we can see what's going on um can you

1166
00:48:47,358 --> 00:48:51,719
talk a little bit about a water test and

1167
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:54,039
what we should look in evaluating

1168
00:48:51,719 --> 00:48:57,719
water yeah

1169
00:48:54,039 --> 00:49:00,838
absolutely so water

1170
00:48:57,719 --> 00:49:03,759
chemistry uh is more complicated than

1171
00:49:00,838 --> 00:49:06,838
than most people think um

1172
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:08,520
especially the relationship between pH

1173
00:49:06,838 --> 00:49:10,599
bicarbonates and alkalinity which are

1174
00:49:08,519 --> 00:49:13,679
all which are three

1175
00:49:10,599 --> 00:49:16,280
different metrics on a on a water test

1176
00:49:13,679 --> 00:49:20,558
that are all very related

1177
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:24,000
so the amount that the pH of your water

1178
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:25,880
is simply a function of the the pH by

1179
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,519
definition is the hydrogen ion

1180
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:30,720
concentration so

1181
00:49:27,519 --> 00:49:33,199
anything that contributes hydrogen

1182
00:49:30,719 --> 00:49:36,000
ions

1183
00:49:33,199 --> 00:49:40,279
is um going to lower your pH it's acidic

1184
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:42,519
and anything that um consumes them is

1185
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:45,119
not and so that's That's the basis

1186
00:49:42,519 --> 00:49:47,318
that's the Baseline and there's a lot of

1187
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:49,599
I don't know water snake oil out there

1188
00:49:47,318 --> 00:49:51,719
but it just it's just good to remember

1189
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:57,400
that that's the fundamental the hydrogen

1190
00:49:51,719 --> 00:50:01,159
ion concentration so um when it comes to

1191
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:03,880
I look at a lot of water tests and the

1192
00:50:01,159 --> 00:50:06,519
the more important thing to look at than

1193
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:09,640
pH is

1194
00:50:06,519 --> 00:50:13,039
alkalinity and

1195
00:50:09,639 --> 00:50:16,039
alkalinity is slightly different in

1196
00:50:13,039 --> 00:50:18,279
definition than pH what it says is it's

1197
00:50:16,039 --> 00:50:20,960
it's saying how much acid would it take

1198
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:24,640
to lower the ph or how resistant to pH

1199
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:27,599
changes your water so why that's

1200
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:29,960
important is

1201
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:32,720
because when your when your water enters

1202
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:34,760
your soil the soil is going to buffer

1203
00:50:32,719 --> 00:50:36,558
the pH people usually most cannabis

1204
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:40,119
Growers understand that

1205
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:42,000
term and so if you if you have low

1206
00:50:40,119 --> 00:50:43,640
alkalinity the water is going to be

1207
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,880
buffered really quickly so it doesn't

1208
00:50:43,639 --> 00:50:49,279
matter if your pH is 8.0 if your

1209
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:50,880
alkalinity is super super low then as

1210
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:53,160
soon as it hits the soil it's going to

1211
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:55,559
revert to whatever the soil pH is and it

1212
00:50:53,159 --> 00:50:57,920
doesn't matter too much however you

1213
00:50:55,559 --> 00:51:01,040
could also have a pH of let's say

1214
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:02,838
6.9 but a really high alkalinity which

1215
00:51:01,039 --> 00:51:04,759
means that when that water enters the

1216
00:51:02,838 --> 00:51:07,239
soil it's not going to be buffered down

1217
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:09,920
as easily and it's in fact going to

1218
00:51:07,239 --> 00:51:13,399
change the soil PH over time so what's

1219
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:15,599
important to understand is that um if

1220
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:17,880
you have high alkalinity that's a better

1221
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:20,599
indicator that you should adjust your pH

1222
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:21,838
than if you just have high pH alone so

1223
00:51:20,599 --> 00:51:24,318
that's the first thing I want to mention

1224
00:51:21,838 --> 00:51:27,358
now the third metric that I mentioned

1225
00:51:24,318 --> 00:51:29,679
was bicarbonates so

1226
00:51:27,358 --> 00:51:34,199
bicarbonat lead to high

1227
00:51:29,679 --> 00:51:36,399
alkalinity so um usually when water runs

1228
00:51:34,199 --> 00:51:38,399
through the parent material of a soil it

1229
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:41,000
picks up carbonates like calcium

1230
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:44,000
carbonate or magnesium carbonate um also

1231
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:46,358
referred to as Free lime and it will go

1232
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:49,159
into the solution and and convert into

1233
00:51:46,358 --> 00:51:51,279
bicarbonate which leads to a higher

1234
00:51:49,159 --> 00:51:53,239
alkalinity and a higher pH so what

1235
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:56,839
you're doing when you add acid to an

1236
00:51:53,239 --> 00:51:57,959
irrigation water is you're dissociating

1237
00:51:56,838 --> 00:52:00,239
the

1238
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:02,838
bicarbonate and therefore lowering the

1239
00:52:00,239 --> 00:52:05,399
alkalinity and lowering the pH I know

1240
00:52:02,838 --> 00:52:08,719
that's so complicated and it's taken me

1241
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:12,639
years to really have a fundamental grasp

1242
00:52:08,719 --> 00:52:17,078
of it but I hope that makes

1243
00:52:12,639 --> 00:52:19,639
sense it it does how do we so when we're

1244
00:52:17,079 --> 00:52:23,519
looking at this test in terms of uh

1245
00:52:19,639 --> 00:52:25,960
bicarbonate levels how do we adjust and

1246
00:52:23,519 --> 00:52:31,480
how concerning is that I guess in

1247
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:35,480
evaluating a water for growing yeah so I

1248
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:35,480
recommend that

1249
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:43,440
when when bicarbonates or I'm sorry when

1250
00:52:40,318 --> 00:52:45,639
total alkalinity goes above about 120

1251
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:48,679
parts per million that's when you should

1252
00:52:45,639 --> 00:52:50,920
really consider applying acid to your

1253
00:52:48,679 --> 00:52:52,960
water now that's that's a relatively

1254
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:55,880
arbitrary number you could you could go

1255
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:58,480
up to 140 or 150 but but usually when

1256
00:52:55,880 --> 00:53:00,559
the alkaline over about 150 160 you

1257
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:02,639
should definitely consider acidifying

1258
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:08,160
your water the alternative would be to

1259
00:53:02,639 --> 00:53:10,358
run your your soil PH a bit lower and if

1260
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:13,440
you submit a saturated taste test with

1261
00:53:10,358 --> 00:53:15,598
your irrigation water that's looking at

1262
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:17,880
the combination of your water with your

1263
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:20,000
soil and that's the pH you should really

1264
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:21,838
be looking at because if you can you can

1265
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,358
definitely have a high pH water with

1266
00:53:21,838 --> 00:53:27,078
high alkalinity and apply it to a low PH

1267
00:53:24,358 --> 00:53:30,639
soil but together they combine your pH

1268
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:32,119
is really bright in range so if you you

1269
00:53:30,639 --> 00:53:34,719
know you should that's what I mean by

1270
00:53:32,119 --> 00:53:36,720
consider acidifying over 120 you don't

1271
00:53:34,719 --> 00:53:38,759
have to but you should start thinking

1272
00:53:36,719 --> 00:53:40,519
about how to how to change your

1273
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:43,040
management to to make sure your soil

1274
00:53:40,519 --> 00:53:45,119
solution pH is optimized so you're

1275
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:47,679
you're saying when you go to Logan with

1276
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:49,240
a complete soil test send them a sample

1277
00:53:47,679 --> 00:53:51,679
of your water too so that when they run

1278
00:53:49,239 --> 00:53:54,159
that saturated paste portion which is

1279
00:53:51,679 --> 00:53:55,480
where they again correct M you this if I

1280
00:53:54,159 --> 00:53:59,399
get wrong they take your soil and

1281
00:53:55,480 --> 00:54:01,280
essentially dissolve it in they'll use

1282
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:02,838
distilled I think I believe or fairly

1283
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:04,319
neutral water unless you send them your

1284
00:54:02,838 --> 00:54:05,719
irrigation water and if they do with

1285
00:54:04,318 --> 00:54:09,119
your irrigation water it's essentially

1286
00:54:05,719 --> 00:54:11,480
What ions come out or or nutrients come

1287
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:13,559
out into that liquid solution and then

1288
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:16,798
they measure

1289
00:54:13,559 --> 00:54:18,480
that exactly and so it's a more accurate

1290
00:54:16,798 --> 00:54:21,440
representation of what your plant roots

1291
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:24,079
are actually seeing so every grower who

1292
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:26,480
goes on my website orders a soil audit I

1293
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:28,960
send them the forms to send in a Logan

1294
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:30,960
test I recommend that they send their 4

1295
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:33,199
ounces of their irrigation water for

1296
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,880
Logan to run the test with their

1297
00:54:33,199 --> 00:54:36,558
irrigation water for that exact reason

1298
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:39,920
now I don't recommend that if you have

1299
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:42,839
super clean water like um r or even most

1300
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:45,960
Municipal Waters they're not going to

1301
00:54:42,838 --> 00:54:48,199
significantly change the soil solution

1302
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:52,240
uh enough to justify having to go find a

1303
00:54:48,199 --> 00:54:52,239
4 oce bottle and ship in

1304
00:54:52,559 --> 00:55:00,040
water so when we talk about acids to

1305
00:54:57,798 --> 00:55:01,719
it's typically the lower pH most of the

1306
00:55:00,039 --> 00:55:05,960
tests I see are dealing with you know

1307
00:55:01,719 --> 00:55:08,798
high pH alkaline bicarbonate um there's

1308
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:12,079
three that I'm aware of sulfuric

1309
00:55:08,798 --> 00:55:13,920
phosphoric and citric um I I think

1310
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:16,640
there's pros and cons to all three I

1311
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:18,960
tend to just stick to phosphoric because

1312
00:55:16,639 --> 00:55:21,480
citric just doesn't have much buffering

1313
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:23,400
capacity it'll fluctuate pretty quickly

1314
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:26,880
um doesn't really seem to change the

1315
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:29,920
soil PH over time and then sulfur cvoid

1316
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:31,640
Cu uh there's a lot of reports that it

1317
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:34,358
damages soil microorganisms

1318
00:55:31,639 --> 00:55:35,879
significantly more we so I don't know

1319
00:55:34,358 --> 00:55:38,598
what are your thoughts on on ways of

1320
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:40,960
lowering pH effectively and as

1321
00:55:38,599 --> 00:55:43,000
organically as

1322
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:44,400
possible yeah so technically in

1323
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,480
certified organic production you can

1324
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:48,400
only use citric you can't use phosphoric

1325
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:50,400
if you're but again that that's only if

1326
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:52,480
you're a veggie producer that has to be

1327
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:55,400
certified yeah I

1328
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:59,719
don't so with citric acid you're right

1329
00:55:55,400 --> 00:56:02,720
and any organic acid for that matter um

1330
00:55:59,719 --> 00:56:05,318
there's it it's for one thing if you

1331
00:56:02,719 --> 00:56:06,919
acidify your water and come back a day

1332
00:56:05,318 --> 00:56:10,038
later it'll just jump right back up

1333
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:12,079
because I my understanding is that

1334
00:56:10,039 --> 00:56:14,559
biology there's bacteria that that

1335
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:17,519
consume the conjugate base and

1336
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:19,599
it it's chemistry that that I couldn't

1337
00:56:17,519 --> 00:56:21,559
really explain on this podcast without

1338
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:23,960
reviewing so anyway it doesn't to your

1339
00:56:21,559 --> 00:56:26,319
point it's not as stable it's also more

1340
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:29,240
expensive and it's just not as powerful

1341
00:56:26,318 --> 00:56:31,679
you have to apply it so much more um

1342
00:56:29,239 --> 00:56:34,919
phosphoric is is great because you're

1343
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:37,639
actually getting soluble phosphorus and

1344
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:40,119
cannabis just loves

1345
00:56:37,639 --> 00:56:42,318
phosphorus um the downside of that is

1346
00:56:40,119 --> 00:56:47,000
that in top soil and in research which

1347
00:56:42,318 --> 00:56:49,318
again may not apply to soiless Media but

1348
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:51,838
High soluble phosphorus will decrease

1349
00:56:49,318 --> 00:56:54,000
micro isal

1350
00:56:51,838 --> 00:56:56,880
colonization because one of the primary

1351
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:58,480
ecological functions of microa is to uh

1352
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:59,880
solubilize phosphorus and deliver

1353
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:01,599
phosphorus to the plant new research

1354
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:04,680
also shows that it does deliver nitrogen

1355
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:06,760
and or other compounds but I'm getting

1356
00:57:04,679 --> 00:57:08,558
side you know sidetracked here so

1357
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:10,920
phosphoric I think is wonderful it's

1358
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:13,359
less expensive it provides soluble

1359
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:14,960
phosphorus and it's much more powerful

1360
00:57:13,358 --> 00:57:19,000
and it doesn't change to what you're

1361
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:23,240
saying Tad sulfuric I recommend for

1362
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:24,880
orchardist um who have a high pH soil in

1363
00:57:23,239 --> 00:57:27,798
a calcarius region because you're

1364
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:31,119
changing the solution you you're never

1365
00:57:27,798 --> 00:57:32,880
going to reduce the pH of that soil um

1366
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:35,400
because it's there's just so much Free

1367
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:36,720
lime that you just take lifetimes of

1368
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:39,079
huge sulfur

1369
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:41,798
applications um but you can change the

1370
00:57:39,079 --> 00:57:45,519
soil solution pH which is really where I

1371
00:57:41,798 --> 00:57:48,599
work I work on this on the solution um

1372
00:57:45,519 --> 00:57:50,798
both in in all my Consulting and so the

1373
00:57:48,599 --> 00:57:53,640
the you can install a sulfur burner

1374
00:57:50,798 --> 00:57:56,639
which um essentially uses sulfuric acid

1375
00:57:53,639 --> 00:57:58,920
it it shoots sulfur into the water drops

1376
00:57:56,639 --> 00:58:01,400
I don't necessarily I haven't used

1377
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:02,920
sulfuric acid specifically a lot of

1378
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:06,039
people have come to me with that same

1379
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:08,760
concern that you just expressed around

1380
00:58:06,039 --> 00:58:12,160
um you know hurting biology and I

1381
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:14,559
understand that sulfur can be used as a

1382
00:58:12,159 --> 00:58:17,358
Fungicide and a biological suppressant

1383
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:23,000
but I haven't seen a lot of evidence or

1384
00:58:17,358 --> 00:58:25,639
research that um sulfur decreases

1385
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:29,239
biological uh Community composition

1386
00:58:25,639 --> 00:58:31,598
biomass Mass activity necessarily so I'm

1387
00:58:29,239 --> 00:58:33,159
I'm totally open to learn and and be

1388
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:34,359
schooled on that but I think that's one

1389
00:58:33,159 --> 00:58:36,078
assumption that we should all question

1390
00:58:34,358 --> 00:58:39,719
and just make sure that we are I like

1391
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:41,240
that uh following the research on that

1392
00:58:39,719 --> 00:58:42,919
yeah I will say that I've been working

1393
00:58:41,239 --> 00:58:45,399
with some facilities that have had been

1394
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:47,599
battling high pH in their soils and the

1395
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:49,639
applications of agricultural sulfur

1396
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:52,920
every cycle in low doses has

1397
00:58:49,639 --> 00:58:56,400
successfully lowered the pH over

1398
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:58,838
time um great and while we haven't been

1399
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:00,798
measuring soil biology you know

1400
00:58:58,838 --> 00:59:02,960
effectively what we're seeing in terms

1401
00:59:00,798 --> 00:59:06,318
of plant growth and plants response is

1402
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:09,838
uh increased yields because and my you

1403
00:59:06,318 --> 00:59:13,000
know my hypothesis on this is as our pH

1404
00:59:09,838 --> 00:59:14,639
drops into a more optimal range for that

1405
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:17,719
plant it's easier for the plant to

1406
00:59:14,639 --> 00:59:20,920
access nutrients thereby allowing it to

1407
00:59:17,719 --> 00:59:23,279
like like you talked about uh with um

1408
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:26,200
the amino acids it allows the plant to

1409
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:28,920
receive those nutrients uh in an easier

1410
00:59:26,199 --> 00:59:31,000
form or with less work so that it's able

1411
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:33,680
to put more energy into its its overall

1412
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,679
biomass and

1413
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:40,079
yield absolutely I I think that you know

1414
00:59:37,318 --> 00:59:41,880
pH is is and again I think everyone

1415
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:44,880
knows this it's so important and I would

1416
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:48,358
choose to fix my pH and it's also

1417
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:51,318
important to keep in mind that

1418
00:59:48,358 --> 00:59:52,798
um there was a there was a 2020 study

1419
00:59:51,318 --> 00:59:56,199
that happened this year it was a meta

1420
00:59:52,798 --> 00:59:59,079
analysis that analyzed uh over 1,200

1421
00:59:56,199 --> 01:00:01,798
experiments that examine soil microbial

1422
00:59:59,079 --> 01:00:05,720
diversity and which is a very specific

1423
01:00:01,798 --> 01:00:07,639
metric it's not examining uh microbial

1424
01:00:05,719 --> 01:00:10,558
Community composition or Community

1425
01:00:07,639 --> 01:00:12,960
activity or biomass it's it's diversity

1426
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:14,480
specifically and it found that the

1427
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:17,159
number of species or the species

1428
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:20,358
diversity is most explained by a change

1429
01:00:17,159 --> 01:00:23,519
in PH so again pH is the driving Factor

1430
01:00:20,358 --> 01:00:26,639
behind species diversity in soil and

1431
01:00:23,519 --> 01:00:28,559
again may not apply to to soiless Med

1432
01:00:26,639 --> 01:00:30,239
may not apply to these systems where

1433
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:32,160
we're constantly applying teas and

1434
01:00:30,239 --> 01:00:33,798
ferments and things but it's important

1435
01:00:32,159 --> 01:00:36,078
to remember that if if we get the right

1436
01:00:33,798 --> 01:00:40,318
pH in the long term that's going to

1437
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:40,318
dictate diversity more than anything

1438
01:00:41,079 --> 01:00:46,519
else sorry I had a quick cough there I

1439
01:00:43,519 --> 01:00:49,358
turned down my mic um apologies no

1440
01:00:46,519 --> 01:00:51,358
problem um yeah I that makes I thought I

1441
01:00:49,358 --> 01:00:52,759
said something no it wasn't you I was

1442
01:00:51,358 --> 01:00:56,798
trying not to cough on there but it

1443
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:58,720
looks like I didn't make it um cool uh

1444
01:00:56,798 --> 01:01:00,880
one other thing I know we've uh we're

1445
01:00:58,719 --> 01:01:02,959
starting to run long here um probably

1446
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:04,519
have to have you back on but I wanted to

1447
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:06,720
at least there were two more topics that

1448
01:01:04,519 --> 01:01:08,920
I wanted to cover in this podcast um

1449
01:01:06,719 --> 01:01:10,639
really quickly would be heavy metals and

1450
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:12,920
then cover crops but let's start with

1451
01:01:10,639 --> 01:01:14,159
let's start with heavy metals um I'm

1452
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:16,559
seeing a lot

1453
01:01:14,159 --> 01:01:18,199
of not a lot that I don't want to

1454
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:20,599
exaggerate the issue but I'm seeing

1455
01:01:18,199 --> 01:01:23,480
people fail for heavy metals uh

1456
01:01:20,599 --> 01:01:25,960
typically our Snick I've also seen lead

1457
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:28,599
um how do we manage that most

1458
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:32,318
effectively in soils in terms of our

1459
01:01:28,599 --> 01:01:33,880
input as well as um what other outside

1460
01:01:32,318 --> 01:01:35,798
sources of contamination do we need to

1461
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:38,119
be concerned of um you know primarily

1462
01:01:35,798 --> 01:01:41,038
thinking of water and other other metals

1463
01:01:38,119 --> 01:01:42,480
in our building um do you have any

1464
01:01:41,039 --> 01:01:45,520
thoughts on

1465
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:47,639
that yeah so I don't know the LA that

1466
01:01:45,519 --> 01:01:51,038
the answer to the the second part of the

1467
01:01:47,639 --> 01:01:52,719
question um in terms of I don't suspect

1468
01:01:51,039 --> 01:01:55,160
it's coming from most people's water

1469
01:01:52,719 --> 01:01:57,639
unless they're using some contaminated

1470
01:01:55,159 --> 01:02:00,159
well water and I don't know the sources

1471
01:01:57,639 --> 01:02:02,159
in a facility however I can talk to

1472
01:02:00,159 --> 01:02:04,639
inputs

1473
01:02:02,159 --> 01:02:08,838
and the so I've I've actually been doing

1474
01:02:04,639 --> 01:02:11,879
a lot of research um and I've pulled the

1475
01:02:08,838 --> 01:02:14,199
I've I've found and sourced heavy metal

1476
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:18,000
tests from a number of

1477
01:02:14,199 --> 01:02:20,118
different um brands of soft rock

1478
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:23,599
phosphate Kel meal poultry products

1479
01:02:20,119 --> 01:02:27,278
Alfalfa caranas soybean neem blood and

1480
01:02:23,599 --> 01:02:28,960
on on and on down the list and I've been

1481
01:02:27,278 --> 01:02:32,920
able to Source numbers for arsenic

1482
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:35,119
cadmium Mercury lead and nickel and um

1483
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:38,119
and by the way T I'm I'm releasing all

1484
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:39,960
this in a an online course that I am

1485
01:02:38,119 --> 01:02:42,278
launching called become a cannabis soil

1486
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:46,079
expert I I'll share it with you after

1487
01:02:42,278 --> 01:02:48,318
the podcast oh cool and yeah what I'm

1488
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:51,200
finding is that

1489
01:02:48,318 --> 01:02:53,079
um there are certain product categories

1490
01:02:51,199 --> 01:02:57,239
that are consistently high in certain

1491
01:02:53,079 --> 01:02:59,920
heavy metals so and oh and one more

1492
01:02:57,239 --> 01:03:02,239
barium so for

1493
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:03,680
arsenic there's a whole bunch of of

1494
01:03:02,239 --> 01:03:05,199
learning here and there's a number of

1495
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:07,798
products that I could mention to stay

1496
01:03:05,199 --> 01:03:10,239
away from but if you're failing for

1497
01:03:07,798 --> 01:03:14,000
arsenic the number one thing to look at

1498
01:03:10,239 --> 01:03:15,479
is your Kel meal okay and I'll leave it

1499
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,559
at that for arsenic now if we want to

1500
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:19,599
talk about other specific heavy metals

1501
01:03:17,559 --> 01:03:21,760
um we can kind of go through the list

1502
01:03:19,599 --> 01:03:23,160
but uh I've found that consistently

1503
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:24,520
there's a number of Kel meals that are

1504
01:03:23,159 --> 01:03:26,598
really low and a number that are really

1505
01:03:24,519 --> 01:03:28,278
high so when comes to arsenic now

1506
01:03:26,599 --> 01:03:31,359
there's other sources of arsenic there's

1507
01:03:28,278 --> 01:03:34,000
certain alala products there's um a bit

1508
01:03:31,358 --> 01:03:37,519
of arsenic that comes in through uh

1509
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:39,358
different Rock dusts um as well as a

1510
01:03:37,519 --> 01:03:41,920
couple different brands of

1511
01:03:39,358 --> 01:03:43,880
gypsum but otherwise I mean those are

1512
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:46,838
the those are the categories that that

1513
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:49,838
are going to bring in the most

1514
01:03:46,838 --> 01:03:51,480
arsenic yeah I think in general uh

1515
01:03:49,838 --> 01:03:53,960
people have to realize when you're using

1516
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:57,358
organic soils or organic amendments

1517
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:59,079
there will be low levels of of arsenic

1518
01:03:57,358 --> 01:04:03,598
uh naturally it's just a matter of

1519
01:03:59,079 --> 01:04:06,119
management of heavy metals um I I think

1520
01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:09,119
trying to completely avoid them would be

1521
01:04:06,119 --> 01:04:11,240
quite challenging using Strictly Organic

1522
01:04:09,119 --> 01:04:12,838
amendments but knowing knowing what

1523
01:04:11,239 --> 01:04:14,358
those levels are and making sure we're

1524
01:04:12,838 --> 01:04:16,480
not doing anything to really increase

1525
01:04:14,358 --> 01:04:18,440
them um I think is really important and

1526
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:20,318
then we're finding genetics plays a huge

1527
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:22,400
role some cultivars just pull up heavy

1528
01:04:20,318 --> 01:04:25,719
metals like crazy and other ones could

1529
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:27,680
seem to care less uh you know two two

1530
01:04:25,719 --> 01:04:29,159
genetics in the same room can have

1531
01:04:27,679 --> 01:04:32,118
significantly different heavy metal

1532
01:04:29,159 --> 01:04:35,038
levels just from the testing I'm seeing

1533
01:04:32,119 --> 01:04:36,519
um but when I talk about water my my

1534
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:38,720
thought is primarily with people who are

1535
01:04:36,519 --> 01:04:41,400
using RO water you know

1536
01:04:38,719 --> 01:04:43,399
it's water wants to bond with something

1537
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:47,318
and uh when you when you have it like

1538
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:50,480
that and it's and it's uh strictly just

1539
01:04:47,318 --> 01:04:52,558
H2O I think that you're at risk you're

1540
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:54,559
you're at higher risk of it coming in

1541
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:57,480
contact with metals and then stripping

1542
01:04:54,559 --> 01:04:59,920
those metals um of potential heavy

1543
01:04:57,480 --> 01:05:02,318
metals I I think of like in a reservoir

1544
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:06,318
having a an irrigation pump for example

1545
01:05:02,318 --> 01:05:08,558
could be a risk or um your plumbing in

1546
01:05:06,318 --> 01:05:10,599
your facility and might be able to pull

1547
01:05:08,559 --> 01:05:12,000
strip lead out of that depending on the

1548
01:05:10,599 --> 01:05:13,559
type of Plumbing that you have so that's

1549
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:17,559
sort of what I was getting at in regards

1550
01:05:13,559 --> 01:05:20,880
to water got it that's a great point my

1551
01:05:17,559 --> 01:05:24,519
wife uses a berky filter is double

1552
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:26,920
charcoal filter she puts our our water

1553
01:05:24,519 --> 01:05:28,759
through and you know I always I actually

1554
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:30,960
don't love that because I don't want a

1555
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:32,520
water that's super super stripped of

1556
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:33,798
everything I actually like minerals in

1557
01:05:32,519 --> 01:05:35,759
my water for the same reason you're

1558
01:05:33,798 --> 01:05:38,599
talking about I don't have any basis for

1559
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:40,760
that other than just the idea that there

1560
01:05:38,599 --> 01:05:42,760
you know that water may be stripping my

1561
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:44,160
my stomach or my body of of minerals I'd

1562
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:46,160
rather have minerals in it so I think

1563
01:05:44,159 --> 01:05:47,558
that's a that's a valid point and by the

1564
01:05:46,159 --> 01:05:49,038
way I want to I want to clarify on that

1565
01:05:47,559 --> 01:05:50,440
Kel meal comment I'm not saying don't

1566
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:52,039
use Kel meal I'm not saying don't use

1567
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:54,079
these products I don't want people to

1568
01:05:52,039 --> 01:05:56,359
misinterpret that I'm saying if you're

1569
01:05:54,079 --> 01:05:58,359
failing for something

1570
01:05:56,358 --> 01:06:00,880
and you're using large large quantities

1571
01:05:58,358 --> 01:06:03,838
of Kel meal just second G you know you

1572
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:06,240
should just consider going with less

1573
01:06:03,838 --> 01:06:07,719
oftentimes less is more and I I'd say

1574
01:06:06,239 --> 01:06:09,959
don't freak out about anything unless

1575
01:06:07,719 --> 01:06:12,318
you're actually failing um so I I don't

1576
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:15,559
want to be misinterpreted there that's a

1577
01:06:12,318 --> 01:06:18,920
good point and when we talk about

1578
01:06:15,559 --> 01:06:21,278
um heavy metals in soils one of the

1579
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:22,880
questions I get that I haven't I haven't

1580
01:06:21,278 --> 01:06:24,480
had a chance to research yet is are

1581
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:26,960
there any good cover crops someone could

1582
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:30,278
run to pull heavy Metals out of a soil

1583
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:33,440
let's say you fail hypothetically for U

1584
01:06:30,278 --> 01:06:36,079
Arsenic and you don't want to throw out

1585
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:37,760
all your soil How Could You amend that

1586
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:40,119
quickly with a potential cover crop that

1587
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:42,119
might pull out you know in its biomass

1588
01:06:40,119 --> 01:06:43,358
the Arsenic is there any particular crop

1589
01:06:42,119 --> 01:06:45,440
you're aware of that would be really

1590
01:06:43,358 --> 01:06:49,400
effective at

1591
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:52,159
this gosh I I'm not I'm not aware of

1592
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:55,119
anything for specific Metals um I could

1593
01:06:52,159 --> 01:06:56,920
dive into my my folder of extensive

1594
01:06:55,119 --> 01:06:58,720
resource that I can try to find

1595
01:06:56,920 --> 01:07:01,599
something but

1596
01:06:58,719 --> 01:07:03,838
the the thought I have is grasses are

1597
01:07:01,599 --> 01:07:06,079
are usually bioaccumulators I've worked

1598
01:07:03,838 --> 01:07:08,239
with Growers on cropping out excess

1599
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:11,240
phosphorus for example with grasses I'm

1600
01:07:08,239 --> 01:07:13,399
sorry potassium with grasses um and you

1601
01:07:11,239 --> 01:07:16,038
know the sad thing is hemp hemp and

1602
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:18,240
cannabis there it's it's the the most

1603
01:07:16,039 --> 01:07:20,640
wonderful bioaccumulator so

1604
01:07:18,239 --> 01:07:22,879
unfortunately to your point a lot of

1605
01:07:20,639 --> 01:07:26,038
cultivars are going to be really good at

1606
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:27,760
it um so that's OB obviously not the

1607
01:07:26,039 --> 01:07:29,640
right answer but yeah I'm not sure I'm

1608
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:31,559
not I'm not aware of specific species

1609
01:07:29,639 --> 01:07:34,400
that would do a better

1610
01:07:31,559 --> 01:07:38,119
job okay that's fair I kind of put you

1611
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:39,559
on the spot there uh one other just

1612
01:07:38,119 --> 01:07:41,920
since we we started talking a little

1613
01:07:39,559 --> 01:07:45,599
about a bit about cover crops uh I put

1614
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:49,519
up a video uh this past week on the use

1615
01:07:45,599 --> 01:07:52,838
my thoughts on the use of cover crops uh

1616
01:07:49,519 --> 01:07:56,278
in indoor commercial facilities specific

1617
01:07:52,838 --> 01:07:59,318
to controlled environment agriculture

1618
01:07:56,278 --> 01:08:01,838
uh specific to commercial operations not

1619
01:07:59,318 --> 01:08:03,798
saying not to use cover crops if you're

1620
01:08:01,838 --> 01:08:05,838
uh you know in a tent or you have a

1621
01:08:03,798 --> 01:08:09,440
small grow to manage I'm talking about

1622
01:08:05,838 --> 01:08:11,719
on scale um what are some of the pros

1623
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:14,358
and cons to cover crops and let's talk

1624
01:08:11,719 --> 01:08:16,399
about all their benefits um in an

1625
01:08:14,358 --> 01:08:18,399
outdoor environment you know if we're

1626
01:08:16,399 --> 01:08:21,960
talking about maybe in a uncontrolled

1627
01:08:18,399 --> 01:08:25,759
Greenhouse or in a field uh why do we

1628
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:25,759
want to use cover crops

1629
01:08:26,158 --> 01:08:33,278
yeah so the the purpose of cover crops

1630
01:08:30,119 --> 01:08:36,880
is very context specific Outdoors but

1631
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:38,960
what comes to mind is uh biomass

1632
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:42,798
production weed

1633
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:46,039
suppression and and um

1634
01:08:42,798 --> 01:08:47,479
nitrogen uh fixation those are the three

1635
01:08:46,039 --> 01:08:49,519
main you know there's other things

1636
01:08:47,479 --> 01:08:52,198
there's water conservation and water

1637
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:54,400
filtration and soil biological promotion

1638
01:08:52,198 --> 01:08:55,879
but usually Outdoors I'm thinking about

1639
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:57,278
how to build organic m matter how to

1640
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:59,679
build nitrogen stocks and how to

1641
01:08:57,279 --> 01:09:01,319
suppress wheat as the three primary

1642
01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:03,319
benefits of cover crops but you know

1643
01:09:01,319 --> 01:09:06,839
there's poll there's pollinator benefits

1644
01:09:03,319 --> 01:09:10,798
and benefits to attracting uh predatory

1645
01:09:06,838 --> 01:09:12,359
insects um there's a whole number of of

1646
01:09:10,798 --> 01:09:15,920
benefits and I'm sure I'm missing

1647
01:09:12,359 --> 01:09:18,798
several now uh if I can just jump jump

1648
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:20,440
over to um that indoor question really

1649
01:09:18,798 --> 01:09:23,439
quickly you know I

1650
01:09:20,439 --> 01:09:25,719
think I think that anyone who's putting

1651
01:09:23,439 --> 01:09:29,000
time toward mastering the art of cover

1652
01:09:25,719 --> 01:09:31,880
cropping is that that is time well spent

1653
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:34,079
and I think that um I don't see a a

1654
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:36,520
severe disadvantage to people who are

1655
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:37,519
really innovating in that way personally

1656
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:39,600
I don't

1657
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:43,520
necessarily uh I tend to agree with you

1658
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:46,679
Tad that that the the possibilities of

1659
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:50,520
increased pest populations in a cover

1660
01:09:46,679 --> 01:09:52,079
crop indoors probably outweigh um the

1661
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:55,040
possible benefits that you would get

1662
01:09:52,079 --> 01:09:57,399
from the things I I discussed and you

1663
01:09:55,039 --> 01:10:00,359
know think it's really laudable that

1664
01:09:57,399 --> 01:10:02,359
that a number of cannabis Growers and

1665
01:10:00,359 --> 01:10:05,679
really most organic farmers are trying

1666
01:10:02,359 --> 01:10:06,960
to model aggro ecosystems after nature

1667
01:10:05,679 --> 01:10:08,480
but we have to remember that when we're

1668
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:11,719
in an indoor environment we've already

1669
01:10:08,479 --> 01:10:14,359
sort of disconnected in such a way that

1670
01:10:11,719 --> 01:10:16,719
um you know we can't perfectly replicate

1671
01:10:14,359 --> 01:10:19,079
nature we're under high-intensity lights

1672
01:10:16,719 --> 01:10:21,760
we don't have the same predatory insect

1673
01:10:19,079 --> 01:10:24,559
populations air flow temperature

1674
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:26,600
fluctuations Etc and then and because of

1675
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:29,280
that test populations can really get out

1676
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:33,199
of control so I do think that personally

1677
01:10:29,279 --> 01:10:36,359
I would I would try to um control that

1678
01:10:33,198 --> 01:10:39,599
variable by eliminating multispecies

1679
01:10:36,359 --> 01:10:41,599
cover crops inside um and even even

1680
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:44,840
single species cover

1681
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:46,239
crops I will say I have one more thing

1682
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:47,400
what yeah go ahead and I have one more

1683
01:10:46,238 --> 01:10:49,519
thing I want to talk about when it comes

1684
01:10:47,399 --> 01:10:51,599
to Blends versus single species if

1685
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:53,520
you're open to that of course yeah I

1686
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:56,400
just wanted to touch on the and just

1687
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:58,640
highlight that I have no issue I I think

1688
01:10:56,399 --> 01:11:01,799
that running trap plants running

1689
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:04,719
indicator plants running Banker plants

1690
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:07,239
um all make a ton of sense um so I'm not

1691
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:09,600
opposed to having other types of plants

1692
01:11:07,238 --> 01:11:11,559
in your facility just not maybe using

1693
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:14,880
them as a as a cover crop necessarily

1694
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:19,480
but in a separate space or container um

1695
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:20,560
in the room um and like like you said it

1696
01:11:19,479 --> 01:11:24,319
I think it's great that people are

1697
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:26,440
innovating in this area um for me my big

1698
01:11:24,319 --> 01:11:28,679
concern like you said is Pest Management

1699
01:11:26,439 --> 01:11:30,519
it's also Labor Management when we're on

1700
01:11:28,679 --> 01:11:32,640
scale and we have to think the number of

1701
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:36,239
times that we literally touch or prune a

1702
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:38,119
plant uh because of the scale it I think

1703
01:11:36,238 --> 01:11:41,198
it adds a whole another variable and

1704
01:11:38,119 --> 01:11:42,479
then the last thing is really I think um

1705
01:11:41,198 --> 01:11:44,839
the last thing is sort of a failing on

1706
01:11:42,479 --> 01:11:46,399
my part in terms of trying trying to

1707
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:50,639
understand fertility management when we

1708
01:11:46,399 --> 01:11:52,238
add in a diversity of cover crop species

1709
01:11:50,639 --> 01:11:53,560
um I I think there's enough challenges

1710
01:11:52,238 --> 01:11:55,519
around fertility management when we're

1711
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:57,960
talking about living soils it's just one

1712
01:11:55,520 --> 01:12:01,960
more variable that makes it even harder

1713
01:11:57,960 --> 01:12:04,239
for me to really wrap my my brain around

1714
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:06,639
um and then the last thing would be I

1715
01:12:04,238 --> 01:12:08,839
like to till the soil um when I go to

1716
01:12:06,639 --> 01:12:10,600
remend I want to get my nutrients

1717
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:12,319
directly down into the rizosphere so

1718
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:14,079
that I know the plant has what it needs

1719
01:12:12,319 --> 01:12:16,439
for its next flowering cycle if we're

1720
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:18,279
talking about flowering in beds and when

1721
01:12:16,439 --> 01:12:20,519
you have a cover crop when you have a

1722
01:12:18,279 --> 01:12:23,238
heavy mulch um it makes it really

1723
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:26,159
challenging to try and reimen that soil

1724
01:12:23,238 --> 01:12:29,039
in that manner um and that's not to say

1725
01:12:26,158 --> 01:12:31,759
like Outdoors I'm a a big proponent of

1726
01:12:29,039 --> 01:12:33,679
no till big proponent of cover crops um

1727
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:36,000
for all the reasons that you listed I

1728
01:12:33,679 --> 01:12:38,960
think they're wonderful um I'm just I'm

1729
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:40,679
not as convinced as of today as of the

1730
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:44,480
recording of This podcast that all of

1731
01:12:40,679 --> 01:12:46,679
these Concepts necessarily translate to

1732
01:12:44,479 --> 01:12:49,000
controlled environment agriculture on

1733
01:12:46,679 --> 01:12:51,920
scale

1734
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:53,880
indoors great take it away yeah you know

1735
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:55,520
it's it's well yeah know I have so many

1736
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:58,079
thoughts and I think that's so well said

1737
01:12:55,520 --> 01:13:00,360
p i there's a quote I really love once

1738
01:12:58,079 --> 01:13:01,880
you start asking questions innocence is

1739
01:13:00,359 --> 01:13:05,119
gone and I feel like that in so many

1740
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:08,800
ways where I have a general sense of how

1741
01:13:05,119 --> 01:13:11,238
I idealistically want to create

1742
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:13,719
agroecosystems but the more that I learn

1743
01:13:11,238 --> 01:13:16,279
the more nuanced and con context there

1744
01:13:13,719 --> 01:13:17,920
is that doesn't always allow it uh

1745
01:13:16,279 --> 01:13:20,039
perfect application so I think the

1746
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:22,960
general mindset of of cover crops is so

1747
01:13:20,039 --> 01:13:24,880
wonderful and diverse cover crops but um

1748
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:27,600
when it comes to scale in production it

1749
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:30,840
there's tradeoffs and I'm with you that

1750
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:33,199
and on that note I mean I I totally

1751
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:36,440
understand the benefits of no till

1752
01:13:33,198 --> 01:13:41,079
especially in outdoor um

1753
01:13:36,439 --> 01:13:43,799
soil top soil um I think it really

1754
01:13:41,079 --> 01:13:45,719
is half of the equation to soil Health

1755
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:47,960
when we're talking about soil organic

1756
01:13:45,719 --> 01:13:51,279
matter but I have the same thing in in

1757
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:53,679
soiless media um in cannabis production

1758
01:13:51,279 --> 01:13:55,800
I really like to a really thorough

1759
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:58,399
homogeneous Amendment and and that

1760
01:13:55,800 --> 01:14:01,800
requires tillage so there's trade-offs

1761
01:13:58,399 --> 01:14:03,119
there really are and um I think those

1762
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:05,279
are the tough decisions that that

1763
01:14:03,119 --> 01:14:08,800
Growers have to make and and the final

1764
01:14:05,279 --> 01:14:12,439
point on this is there's multi-species

1765
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:15,119
cover crops are uh really popular

1766
01:14:12,439 --> 01:14:16,960
they're really great and another study

1767
01:14:15,119 --> 01:14:20,119
just came out another meta analysis this

1768
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:23,119
year that that looked at cover crop

1769
01:14:20,119 --> 01:14:25,679
Blends versus single

1770
01:14:23,119 --> 01:14:28,920
species and there were 2 studies they've

1771
01:14:25,679 --> 01:14:31,399
looked at and they ranked um these

1772
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:35,560
Blends versus their constituent

1773
01:14:31,399 --> 01:14:37,920
monoculture species based on uh biomass

1774
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:39,880
production weed suppression water

1775
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:44,079

1776
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:46,600
retention and um soil biology promotion

1777
01:14:44,079 --> 01:14:48,279
and what was so interesting it was

1778
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:50,719
painful honestly for me to to read the

1779
01:14:48,279 --> 01:14:53,519
results of this because I was expecting

1780
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:55,279
the the cover crop blends to outperform

1781
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:58,159
the single species but they actually

1782
01:14:55,279 --> 01:15:03,119
found that uh 88% of the time there was

1783
01:14:58,158 --> 01:15:05,000
no difference in those um criteria and

1784
01:15:03,119 --> 01:15:06,960
there were a few single species Blends

1785
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:09,560
that did better a few multispecies

1786
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:12,920
Blends that did better uh across these

1787
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:16,120
studies but um it was just kind of

1788
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:17,880
humbling to me to to realize that that

1789
01:15:16,119 --> 01:15:19,840
obviously we're trying to mimic nature

1790
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:22,359
and we're trying to mimic diversity but

1791
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:23,800
it doesn't always give us the result

1792
01:15:22,359 --> 01:15:26,399
that we're intending because of the

1793
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:28,920
complexity of nature so uh it was a

1794
01:15:26,399 --> 01:15:30,519
really fascinating study now the the

1795
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:32,279
research does show that when you're

1796
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:34,840
cover cropping multi-year so in the

1797
01:15:32,279 --> 01:15:36,920
three to fiveyear time Horizon grassland

1798
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:39,480
studies show that that

1799
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:41,399
multispecies um tend to produce much

1800
01:15:39,479 --> 01:15:43,000
more biomass because they're less

1801
01:15:41,399 --> 01:15:45,479
they're less susceptible to fungal

1802
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:47,960
disease um which will wipe out a a

1803
01:15:45,479 --> 01:15:50,000
monoculture but when we're when we're

1804
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:51,880
talking about cover cropping outside I'm

1805
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:54,119
I'm going back to the basics and and

1806
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:55,400
coaching Growers to just keep it simple

1807
01:15:54,119 --> 01:15:58,079
stick with something that's going to

1808
01:15:55,399 --> 01:16:01,000
work and that's going to achieve the

1809
01:15:58,079 --> 01:16:02,319
underlying production goals um because

1810
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:05,238
sometimes I think we can overthink

1811
01:16:02,319 --> 01:16:08,000
things put together a 35 species blend

1812
01:16:05,238 --> 01:16:10,238
and not necessarily uh make our lives

1813
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:12,079
any easier in the process so I I know

1814
01:16:10,238 --> 01:16:14,079
that's a qucious way to to talk about

1815
01:16:12,079 --> 01:16:16,479
cover crops but um I hope hopefully

1816
01:16:14,079 --> 01:16:17,920
that's helpful insight yeah maybe that's

1817
01:16:16,479 --> 01:16:19,678
something we could put up on the podcast

1818
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:21,800
page for listeners who want to Dove a

1819
01:16:19,679 --> 01:16:23,840
little deeper into that I I think that's

1820
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:26,320
really interesting I get the I get the

1821
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:28,360
question sometimes from outdoor Growers

1822
01:16:26,319 --> 01:16:32,198
of what cover crop should I

1823
01:16:28,359 --> 01:16:34,079
run and you know everyone has a

1824
01:16:32,198 --> 01:16:36,599
different uh environment that they're

1825
01:16:34,079 --> 01:16:39,000
growing in I usually tell them to talk

1826
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:40,440
to someone like yourself an agronomist

1827
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:42,238
but then I also say go talk to your

1828
01:16:40,439 --> 01:16:43,559
neighbors find out what the Farmers near

1829
01:16:42,238 --> 01:16:44,919
you are using and what they've had

1830
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:46,199
successes with because they that

1831
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:48,079
microclimate is going to be very

1832
01:16:46,198 --> 01:16:52,039
different than what I'm dealing with

1833
01:16:48,079 --> 01:16:53,319
here in uh the Seattle area um so that's

1834
01:16:52,039 --> 01:16:55,639
that's where I like to start when it

1835
01:16:53,319 --> 01:16:57,920
comes to cover crops but again I I

1836
01:16:55,639 --> 01:17:01,960
totally agree with you they work we we

1837
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:03,719
should be using cover crops um and um we

1838
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:05,600
should be using no till when we want to

1839
01:17:03,719 --> 01:17:07,880
talk about regenerative agriculture for

1840
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:10,360
improving soil

1841
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:13,159
health I love that find the oldest

1842
01:17:10,359 --> 01:17:16,238
farmer in your area and ask ask them

1843
01:17:13,158 --> 01:17:18,198
what will do the best yeah and one other

1844
01:17:16,238 --> 01:17:19,879
thing I want to just add to this is I

1845
01:17:18,198 --> 01:17:22,359
love that when I put out that video on

1846
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:23,840
Instagram the majority of people uh that

1847
01:17:22,359 --> 01:17:25,599
even that didn't dis that even that

1848
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:28,119
disagree with me or maybe made reaction

1849
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:31,159
videos um it was all in good

1850
01:17:28,119 --> 01:17:33,238
spirit we can disagree on these things

1851
01:17:31,158 --> 01:17:34,638
these points we're all organic Growers

1852
01:17:33,238 --> 01:17:36,079
at the end of the day we're all

1853
01:17:34,639 --> 01:17:38,600
promoting soil Health we're all doing

1854
01:17:36,079 --> 01:17:41,079
what we think is best for the plant for

1855
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:44,000
our facility for our bottom line uh it

1856
01:17:41,079 --> 01:17:45,519
doesn't have to be personal um and these

1857
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:48,238
decisions that we make don't make one

1858
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:50,400
person smarter or or less or more

1859
01:17:48,238 --> 01:17:52,198
educated than another person um I think

1860
01:17:50,399 --> 01:17:53,879
these dialogues are what further our

1861
01:17:52,198 --> 01:17:55,879
knowledge and then let's take these

1862
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:57,800
conversations and put put them into like

1863
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:59,880
experimental design and really get to

1864
01:17:57,800 --> 01:18:01,480
the bottom so we have a firm answer that

1865
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:03,800
supports our conclusions cuz right now

1866
01:18:01,479 --> 01:18:06,238
that research just does not exist so I

1867
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:09,639
can't say with confidence that what I

1868
01:18:06,238 --> 01:18:11,479
shared regarding cover crops is optimal

1869
01:18:09,639 --> 01:18:13,279
um I can give you my Logic for why I

1870
01:18:11,479 --> 01:18:14,638
think it is and someone could do the

1871
01:18:13,279 --> 01:18:18,158
same in response but at the end of the

1872
01:18:14,639 --> 01:18:20,199
day we really don't we we can't say uh

1873
01:18:18,158 --> 01:18:21,319
conclusively one way or another and I

1874
01:18:20,198 --> 01:18:23,039
think that's important that that

1875
01:18:21,319 --> 01:18:24,559
dialogue stays positive and I I

1876
01:18:23,039 --> 01:18:25,679
appreciate that about the majority I

1877
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:27,039
mean there's always going to be Trolls

1878
01:18:25,679 --> 01:18:28,800
but I appreciate that about the majority

1879
01:18:27,039 --> 01:18:30,960
of people that I've interacted with on

1880
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:33,400
on these

1881
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:35,800
subjects Heen yeah I think we're all

1882
01:18:33,399 --> 01:18:37,960
just looking for more information more

1883
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:39,199
knowledge and more Collaborative

1884
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:41,399
Learning when i s see those

1885
01:18:39,198 --> 01:18:44,279
conversations and those videos I just

1886
01:18:41,399 --> 01:18:45,960
think arising tide lifts All Ships we

1887
01:18:44,279 --> 01:18:47,960
are all in this together trying to learn

1888
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:50,520
more so we can produce better crops and

1889
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:53,239
be more profitable and I think dialogue

1890
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:55,480
uh is the best way to do that so I

1891
01:18:53,238 --> 01:18:57,399
support that 100%

1892
01:18:55,479 --> 01:19:00,238
yeah well I I really appreciate what you

1893
01:18:57,399 --> 01:19:02,920
shared today I look forward to um

1894
01:19:00,238 --> 01:19:06,039
further conversations uh maybe further

1895
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:10,840
podcast uh I know that uh you and I will

1896
01:19:06,039 --> 01:19:12,519
continue to chat off air and I um I I

1897
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:14,440
I've even talked to you and Ben I know

1898
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:16,600
we've talked about uh working on some

1899
01:19:14,439 --> 01:19:19,759
papers in the future to submit to

1900
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:21,320
journals potentially to to further this

1901
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:22,880
whole process along too I know there's a

1902
01:19:21,319 --> 01:19:26,399
lot of experiments you want to run and

1903
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:29,159
Ben and I have a a a lifetime list as

1904
01:19:26,399 --> 01:19:30,519
well so uh I really appreciate that and
