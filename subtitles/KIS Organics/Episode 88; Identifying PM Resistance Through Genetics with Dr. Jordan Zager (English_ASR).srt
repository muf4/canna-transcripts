00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,320
welcome to the cannabis cultivation and

3
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,640
science podcast i'm your host tad hussey

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,160
of kiss organics this is the podcast

5
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,160
where we discuss the cutting edge of

6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,000
growing from a science-based perspective

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,359
and drawn top experts from around the

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,399
industry to share their wisdom and

9
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,880
knowledge

10
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,880
my guest this week is dr jordan zagger

11
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,120
jordan is an expert in natural product

12
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,600
biosynthesis and chemical analysis of

13
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:43,599
cannabis resin compounds dr zeiger

14
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,520
earned his phd from washington state

15
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,439
university where his research set the

16
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,520
stage for studying the regulatory events

17
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:51,519
governing gene expression and cannabis

18
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,399
and their effect on the biosynthesis of

19
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,000
trichome cannabinoids and terpenoids

20
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,840
early in his career jordan set his

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,759
sights on aggressively applying modern

22
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,920
scientific methods to the medicinal and

23
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:03,920
recreational cannabis industry and to

24
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,118
bring cultivators the tools to become

25
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,840
exceptional

26
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:09,599
dr zager is now the ceo and co-founder

27
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,840
of dewey scientific in pullman

28
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:13,839
washington now on to the show

29
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,080
hi jordan thanks for coming on the show

30
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,079
today

31
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,359
hey kat happy to be here thanks for

32
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,478
having me

33
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:24,640
yeah let's start off talking a little

34
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:26,478
bit about your background can you share

35
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,359
a little bit about how you got into uh

36
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:29,359
this type of research

37
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:34,719
yeah so my you know formal educational

38
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,640
background i'm a biochemist who chose to

39
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:39,118
study plant biochemistry

40
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,960
um i have a bachelor's of

41
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:42,719
biochemistry and molecular biology from

42
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:44,719
the university of nevada

43
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:47,759
while i was there i worked in a plant

44
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:48,560
biofuels lab where we were looking at

45
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,319
a

46
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:54,320
potential crop for biodiesel production

47
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:56,559
specifically looking at the the oil

48
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:57,839
quality of the the seeds produced by

49
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,280
this this crop

50
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,640
um

51
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,200
and it was during that time you know as

52
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,079
my college years i found this love for

53
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,520
biotechnology um i was a college student

54
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:09,199
smoking weed

55
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:10,959
and sort of have this idea of let's

56
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:13,119
let's merge these two things let's do

57
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,360
some biotech in cannabis um so that led

58
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,599
me up to washington state university

59
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,120
um in 2014

60
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:20,878
recreational cannabis had just become

61
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:25,280
legalized and they had a market at that

62
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:27,439
time and i found a lab that studied

63
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,120
terpene biosynthesis in glandular

64
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:31,039
trichomes

65
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,878
so at the time i knew enough about

66
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:35,039
cannabis to know that that was very

67
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:37,280
relevant and just to sort of back up

68
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:38,479
right glandular trichomes are these

69
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,560
little tiny

70
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:43,199
um cellular

71
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,120
chemical factories that stand on the

72
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:47,518
leaf of plants they're they're found on

73
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,959
about 30 of all plant species

74
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,800
um

75
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,199
so the last the lab i entered for my

76
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,439
doctorate um studied the metabolism in

77
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:57,199
those and and typically

78
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:58,878
uh these these structures these

79
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:00,958
trichomes they make essential oil

80
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:02,878
compounds which for the most part are

81
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,640
mono and fescue terpenes

82
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:07,359
and now those are famous in cannabis

83
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:09,759
because they they provide each variety

84
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,280
or strain with their own unique aroma

85
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:13,280
and you know it's

86
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,439
gaining traction that it's also the

87
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,360
these terpene compounds sort of

88
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:18,878
influence the user experience for from

89
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,879
strain to strength

90
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:22,318
so yeah that's how i got into all of

91
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:23,919
this

92
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:27,518
i eventually was able to work with

93
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:29,119
cannabis genomics as part of my phd

94
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,879
dissertation

95
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,239
and upon graduating

96
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:37,199
with my doctorate in plant biochemistry

97
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,878
when often started dewey scientific a

98
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:40,479
cannabis focused biotechnology company

99
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:41,919
where we are trying to make cannabis

100
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:44,560
better through can

101
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:46,399
through credible science

102
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,439
and so that's what uh you're doing now

103
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,439
with dewey scientific

104
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,959
that's right so yeah dewey scientific we

105
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,840
are you know implementing modern methods

106
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,680
in

107
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,000
plant breeding right leveraging the

108
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,438
genome as much as we can to identify

109
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,799
markers that associate with certain

110
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:04,079
traits and then make sure these traits

111
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,840
get into

112
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,920
the the varieties that we develop and

113
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,920
ultimately put onto the market both for

114
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:11,598
other farmers to use and we also have a

115
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:14,399
commercial brand dewey cannabis company

116
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:16,399
we're located in washington state

117
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,918
where we get a sort of market test the

118
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,599
varieties that come out of our breeding

119
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:21,839
program

120
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,320
and get you know consumer feedback uh

121
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,319
directly

122
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,560
that's what we're doing at dewey

123
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,240
great well

124
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,160
can you just touch briefly on so what

125
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,960
you're doing is is breeding not you're

126
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:38,960
not necessarily doing any uh

127
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:41,839
gmo stuff at this point is that correct

128
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:44,000
yeah that's correct we are not

129
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:46,319
directly putting genes from other

130
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,360
organisms into cannabis we are not

131
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:49,439
you know

132
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:53,520
using

133
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:56,000
various viral or bacterial

134
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:58,399
constructs to sort of manipulate

135
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,079
cannabis genetics all we are doing is

136
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:01,519
you know sequencing the varieties we

137
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:03,120
like

138
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:05,198
sequencing the genome of the varieties

139
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,199
we like to sort of

140
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,360
better understand what we have

141
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,360
and then once once we know what we have

142
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,199
we can start to make targeted

143
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,400
and intelligent breeding decisions right

144
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,319
if you think of the way that cannabis

145
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:18,879
has been bred and treated

146
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:20,560
um over the last 40 50 years through

147
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:22,719
prohibition

148
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,759
right breeders have been very limited in

149
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:28,960
their access to technology their access

150
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:31,199
to facilities

151
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:32,799
and so it's sort of fallen behind other

152
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,160
horticultural crops right if you look at

153
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,319
blueberry there's

154
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,880
there's a thousand papers on blueberry

155
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:40,959
resistance to various pathogens

156
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:42,079
fungus

157
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:42,879
insects

158
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:44,478
and

159
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:46,478
because of the the pro

160
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:48,000
the prohibitory nature of cannabis we

161
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:49,680
just hadn't

162
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,120
no one's really quite gotten there so i

163
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,478
think that's that's

164
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,000
that's really what we're focused on is

165
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:56,240
just catching it up to these other

166
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,918
horticultural uh species from an

167
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,439
understanding and then you know putting

168
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:01,599
that understanding into practice through

169
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:04,959
smart breeding

170
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,240
yeah i think that's a really good uh

171
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:08,799
analogy that you're using they're

172
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,319
comparing it with vegetable crops that

173
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,919
we're more familiar with because i know

174
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,080
when i go out to buy

175
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:15,839
say an apple tree i'm going to look for

176
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:16,719
what diseases are most prevalent in my

177
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:19,198
area

178
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,720
and then look for a particular variety

179
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,038
that i know is going to provide some

180
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,680
resistance to that um you know we have a

181
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:28,719
lot of issues with rust around here for

182
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,319
example with pears so i know that

183
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,600
there's varieties i can choose that are

184
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,680
going to be more resistant i'm going to

185
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,520
have a better crop

186
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,840
and and you know what you're getting in

187
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:39,680
terms of a flavor profile too and and

188
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:41,599
yield profiles so

189
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,959
uh i think it's wonderful so you're just

190
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,080
identifying

191
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:48,638
what uh particular markers may be most

192
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:50,159
useful for someone

193
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,639
and then by identifying you can then

194
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,319
breed plants that have these traits is

195
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,639
that sort of what you're what you're

196
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:59,280
getting out there

197
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,840
absolutely yeah so you know without the

198
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:05,598
the genetic marker component of this the

199
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:05,598
breeder is sort of left to

200
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,880
uncovering things visually as the plant

201
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,720
matures now you know cannabis is a

202
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:16,079
relatively quickly maturing plant you

203
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,759
know compared to say an apple tree

204
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:19,680
so you know the time burden there an

205
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,879
eight week flower cycle

206
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,400
is you know relatively quick but

207
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:25,918
there's so much ground that we have to

208
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:28,318
make up in cannabis

209
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:29,598
that we need to be making decisions a

210
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,319
lot quicker and that's what genetic

211
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:34,000
markers enable right so we now have a

212
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,800
genetic marker for

213
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,720
say

214
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,478
powdery mildew resistance

215
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,840
um and we want to make sure that this

216
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:41,120
gets into all of our commercial

217
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:42,959
varieties

218
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,360
so at the seedling stage we can just

219
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:46,959
take a a small little leaf sample run a

220
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,280
quick pcr

221
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:49,279
um

222
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,000
assay and and then we know which in this

223
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:55,439
population is powdery mildew resistant

224
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,720
and then we can we can get rid of

225
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:58,959
everything that doesn't have powdery

226
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,160
mildew resistance and then we're

227
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:02,239
you know

228
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,960
at ease that all these varieties that

229
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:08,000
we're growing and developing are are

230
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:10,079
will be protected against powdery mildew

231
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,918
this is just another tool essentially

232
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:13,758
utilizing technology to speed up the

233
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:15,038
process because normally as

234
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,879
traditionally as a breeder you'd have to

235
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:19,839
grow out all these plants you then have

236
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:21,439
to evaluate them you know qualitatively

237
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:23,439
in terms of

238
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:24,879
terpenes and

239
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:26,959
the effects

240
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:29,520
of you know whatever whatever effects

241
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:31,680
that may synergistically occur with that

242
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:33,120
particular plant um

243
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,560
how resistant it is to different

244
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,440
diseases that it may have been exposed

245
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,518
to

246
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,000
and then you may choose to clone or

247
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,038
reproduce it that way but

248
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,479
this just gives you a lot more

249
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:44,319
information earlier on if you can

250
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:47,360
identify these markers and and what

251
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,040
you're saying is that we haven't

252
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,800
we don't we haven't identified all these

253
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:52,559
markers so we don't know where on the

254
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:54,159
genome

255
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:55,278
you know powdery mildew resistance which

256
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:57,360
is what we're going to talk about today

257
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:58,879
is is particular was

258
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,399
located is that

259
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:02,559
sort of what you're what you're saying

260
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:06,480
there

261
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:08,799
yeah yeah exactly we're developing the

262
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,639
the tools rooted in molecular biology to

263
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:12,958
accelerate plant breeding

264
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:12,958
um

265
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:15,519
exactly

266
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,040
okay well let's let's dive into the

267
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,480
paper and i have to admit um you know

268
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:20,079
breeding is not

269
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,720
it's not my strength it's not an area

270
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,240
that i have a lot of knowledge in so um

271
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,480
i'm probably going to be asking the

272
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,639
types of questions to help

273
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,839
other listeners like myself that just

274
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:32,080
haven't

275
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,600
don't have anywhere near your academic

276
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,480
background on this

277
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,560
but the paper itself i will have a link

278
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,080
to directly in the podcast

279
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:42,159
it's called discovery and genetic

280
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:45,920
mapping of pm1 a powdery mildew

281
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:48,319
resistance gene in cannabis sativa and

282
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:50,639
this was a paper produced by dewey

283
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,839
scientific in conjunction with oregon

284
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:53,278
cbd

285
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,240
and we'll have links directly to the

286
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:54,889
paper

287
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,720
and

288
00:09:54,889 --> 00:09:57,759
[Music]

289
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,200
is there anything else you want to say

290
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:02,559
on that before we dive into the paper

291
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,399
yeah you know i just want to sort of

292
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:07,518
make clear you know i'm not an author on

293
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:08,958
this paper um this was work performed by

294
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,639
my company doing scientific in

295
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:12,239
collaboration with oregon cbd like you

296
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:14,240
had mentioned but i really just want to

297
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,959
give a shout out to paul mahalos and

298
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,360
andre garfinkel the the two authors um

299
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:21,599
you know this was something that

300
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,000
was a side project in in terms of you

301
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,480
know publishing a public access

302
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,240
research paper um you know i think most

303
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,079
companies if they'd come across a marker

304
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,440
like this they'd steal their lips and

305
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:32,879
it's only theirs

306
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,320
but you know

307
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:35,679
for for us to advance the cannabis

308
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,320
industry we we really want to be

309
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:40,078
developing tools that anybody can use um

310
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,760
and and paul and andrea just really took

311
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:43,519
the uh

312
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:45,679
the initiative on getting this work out

313
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,519
there putting it in the public domain uh

314
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:49,039
because you know the cannabis industry

315
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,120
is only going to advance if everybody

316
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:53,519
can advance and as if you know we're

317
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,360
holding this you know close to our chest

318
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,759
we're the only ones benefiting

319
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,600
and um you know we're just not at that

320
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:02,559
stage in cannabis where there should be

321
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,079
a dominant market player um so just

322
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:05,838
yeah wanted to

323
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:07,759
to praise paul and andrea because this

324
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:10,560
is really their their their brainchild

325
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:13,278
but they they did a tremendous work here

326
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:15,919
i i appreciate you uh saying that and i

327
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:17,838
100 agree i wasn't confident pronouncing

328
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:19,599
their last name so thank you for uh

329
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:22,079
giving them a shout out for

330
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,000
for this work um and and the fact that

331
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:26,399
you are sharing this i think that is

332
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,120
important um and something that i hope

333
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:31,600
more companies will will do as we can so

334
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,399
we can further our overall knowledge

335
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,480
um

336
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,600
i think that's definitely important

337
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,120
so uh

338
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,519
yeah let's let's dive into this paper

339
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,440
and again this is open access so you can

340
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:44,879
read the paper yourself

341
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,160
we'll have a link on the podcast page

342
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:47,838
but let's just start off talking a

343
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:52,159
little bit about powdery mildew in

344
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,160
general so what what is powdery mildew

345
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,879
yeah so powdery mildew is a common term

346
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:59,360
for a lot of

347
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:02,078
or i should say a lot but of many

348
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,919
um pathogenic fungi these are

349
00:12:02,078 --> 00:12:06,078
you know fungus that

350
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:07,360
attack the plant as a pathogen meaning

351
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:09,519
it will

352
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,440
you know maybe act as a parasite maybe

353
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,759
just wants to take advantage of the

354
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,240
plant to spread its spores so that the

355
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:18,078
fungus can live another generation

356
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,839
but peppery mildew is is one of these

357
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:22,000
pathogenic fungi

358
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,440
and it's been found on all sorts of

359
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,240
different crops you know of course

360
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,079
cannabis of course it's cousin hops

361
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,360
it's a problem in the wine industry it's

362
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:31,838
a problem

363
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,919
uh anywhere where you have fluctuating

364
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:36,480
humidity during the growth cycle

365
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:38,958
of any crop

366
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,600
and specifically you know at least in in

367
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:44,958
terms of our research on this we are

368
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,360
referring to the specific uh

369
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:50,159
fungus

370
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:50,159
golovinomyces ambrosie

371
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,639
which

372
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,360
is

373
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:58,000
what we found on our plants um and and

374
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,399
we did some genetic sequencing and found

375
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,078
that it matches the the you know general

376
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,399
term of powdery mildew found in kentucky

377
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:06,799
and ohio and oregon

378
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,879
so it is a just a general

379
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:10,799
uh fungus that attacks crops as they

380
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:13,360
grow

381
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:16,240
and uh i just want to clarify too that

382
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,839
when you when you see pm on

383
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,839
you know different plants that's not

384
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:22,079
necessarily

385
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:24,399
able to cross all plant species so we're

386
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:26,719
not going to necessarily see

387
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:29,039
the powdery mildew that we may find

388
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,160
on our squash as is the same species

389
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:32,319
that's going to be infecting our

390
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:34,159
cannabis

391
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,240
just something i wanted to point out for

392
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:38,159
listeners

393
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,320
yeah that's absolutely correct

394
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:41,838
and uh since it is a catch-all we know

395
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,480
that there's multiple species that

396
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,240
infect cannabis is it necessary really

397
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,399
from a grower perspective to actually

398
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,079
identify the species or can we treat

399
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,639
these all fairly

400
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:55,679
you know synonymously in terms of our

401
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,680
our approach to treatment

402
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:58,639
you know

403
00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:00,719
we uh that's a great question and i

404
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,480
don't have a particularly solid answer

405
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,800
for that no i think some more research

406
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,759
needs to go into this

407
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:10,000
however we we do know that the species

408
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:11,679
we identified here in washington is

409
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,399
problematic in oregon

410
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:14,399
kentucky and

411
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:18,399
ohio that that doesn't mean that

412
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,320
that

413
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,240
there are others in those locales that

414
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,639
that you know other species of powdery

415
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,639
mildew that might be um inhibiting crop

416
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,519
growth and you know we we haven't

417
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,959
um

418
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,799
done these sort of artificial

419
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:32,958
inoculations of these other powdery

420
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:34,719
mildew species

421
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:37,759
mostly because

422
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:40,639
of sort of the biohazard that that poses

423
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:42,879
bring that into a cannabis facility

424
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,879
sure and you you touched a little bit on

425
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:46,958
humidity fluctuation what conditions

426
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:51,439
lead to you know higher spore pressure

427
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:51,439
and actual infection of the leaf tissue

428
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:57,519
yeah so things that that you know where

429
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:58,399
the fungus likes to produce more spores

430
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,560
and

431
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,559
sort of rapidly take over a population

432
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:05,599
are where you have you know larger

433
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:07,198
fluctuations uh in humidity doesn't

434
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,560
matter if it's you know through the day

435
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:10,399
period or through the night period or in

436
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:11,919
between the two but it's generally when

437
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,278
there's this swing you know say you're

438
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:16,479
getting up above

439
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:18,559
60 to 70 percent uh relative humidity

440
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,680
and then dropping down to you know say

441
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:22,799
below 40. um so what that allows is for

442
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:25,599
the

443
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:27,278
spores to be spread when the

444
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,680
humidity is low

445
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:32,720
and when that humidity comes back up the

446
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:32,719
the fungus can then

447
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:35,518
begin to grow on wherever those spores

448
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,600
landed

449
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,039
i think some some simple ways for people

450
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,079
to get around this is just to have a

451
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:42,078
stable um

452
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:45,679
humidity

453
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:47,120
in their their grow environment um you

454
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:48,000
know what we've seen and you know this

455
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,560
is a

456
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,159
sample size of one but at our facility

457
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:55,518
when we when we kept things you know in

458
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:57,919
the between 50 and 60 we we saw a rather

459
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,959
large reduction in powdery mildew

460
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:00,879
um

461
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:03,599
so it's really that swing that allows

462
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:05,919
the spores to spread and then the

463
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,959
increase that then allows the

464
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:11,278
the fungus to flourish

465
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:13,919
yeah i i will comment just anecdotally

466
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:17,439
uh whenever growing giant pumpkins for

467
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:18,958
years i noticed whenever i had a uh

468
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,639
you know a really

469
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:23,359
heavy rainy day

470
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:25,039
followed by a super sunny day

471
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,800
um that was sort of

472
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:28,559
that triggered those those big swings

473
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:31,039
was when i would see powdery mildew

474
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:32,399
start to appear in our in my garden

475
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:35,679
outdoors and it obviously it's something

476
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:38,159
we can't control outdoors but um

477
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:39,919
indoors that's a big that's a big uh a

478
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:41,838
big thing to control in terms of the

479
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:43,679
environment and uh

480
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,519
i guess that leads into

481
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:47,198
genetics then so

482
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,480
what was your experimental design and

483
00:16:47,198 --> 00:16:50,799
how

484
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:54,560
how how did you discover what genetics

485
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:57,120
to really start your project with

486
00:16:54,559 --> 00:17:00,719
yeah this was sort of a a

487
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:03,278
circumstance of of luck um we

488
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,600
we at dewey we have a

489
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:06,959
very nice plant research facility

490
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:09,519
and we have these really old growth

491
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:11,199
chambers that they sort of look like

492
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:14,720
commercial refrigerators from like the

493
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:17,679
60s just these big monster units

494
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,360
um they they do a good job of regulating

495
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,640
light and temperature but they they sort

496
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,719
of suck with humidity they don't

497
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,400
exchange a lot of air with

498
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,318
the external environment

499
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,200
um and so we were just housing some of

500
00:17:26,318 --> 00:17:30,960
the genetics that we were working on um

501
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,319
you know we

502
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:36,000
we had some um

503
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:37,119
i don't know a couple dozen different

504
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
varieties

505
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:40,079
and

506
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
it was in our early days we were leaving

507
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:44,000
these chamber doors closed humidity was

508
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,839
getting well up into the 80s when the

509
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,839
lights were off and the lights turned on

510
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:50,319
it dried out quite a bit

511
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:53,599
and we noticed one of our varieties this

512
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:55,918
pmw 39 which commercially we call rain

513
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:55,918
dance

514
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:04,558
was powdery mildew was not growing on it

515
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,160
um so our breeder paul

516
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:08,960
said hey i think i think we might have a

517
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:11,759
resistant variety um so so what he did

518
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,360
was he took this pnw 39

519
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:15,599
very resistant

520
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:17,359
he crossed it with this jumping jack

521
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:19,839
variety that was

522
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:21,918
very susceptible or you know on the

523
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:24,959
higher end of susceptibility

524
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:27,200
and and made a breeding cross

525
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:30,079
you know some other background on

526
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:32,720
pnw39 and jumping jack pnw39 while it

527
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:34,079
was susceptible is a very low yielder

528
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:38,079
commercially

529
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:39,439
it's phd content is generally sub 20

530
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:41,599
so it's not really a commercially

531
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:44,080
appealing variety for farmers

532
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:46,558
on the flip side jumping jack is a very

533
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:49,519
high yielder it regularly produces flour

534
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:51,678
that tests above 28 thc um and that's

535
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:54,000
that's you know sort of the the farmer's

536
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,960
dream however it succumbed to powdery

537
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,038
mildew

538
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,880
whenever it came into contact with it

539
00:18:57,038 --> 00:19:00,000
um so so what paul did was he crossed

540
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,039
these two

541
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,880
um

542
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:05,038
he he raised

543
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:08,480
he was just shy of a hundred of those

544
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:08,480
progeny those children

545
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,320
and we took those children and put them

546
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,000
into that that swampy humid growth

547
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:15,839
chamber that we have

548
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,200
and we started scoring for powdering

549
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:19,359
mildew resistance

550
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,200
um and what we saw and this is sort of

551
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:24,479
jumping back into you know high school

552
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:28,319
biology with gregor mendel um was a

553
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,919
segregation pattern of one to two to one

554
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:32,639
which is

555
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:34,080
just classic mendelian segregation as

556
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,520
it's called right i think back to

557
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:37,599
punnett squares

558
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:39,519
um

559
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:40,439
where can you elaborate on it for those

560
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:41,839
of us that

561
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,519
[Music]

562
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:45,439
may not have taken these courses or

563
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:47,038
really remember all of the stuff i mean

564
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,759
i took a little bit on mendel but i've

565
00:19:47,038 --> 00:19:51,599
promptly forgotten most of it so yeah

566
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:54,640
yeah so greg gregor mendel was a i

567
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:56,159
believe a belgian monk in the late 1800s

568
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,640
who was

569
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,558
breeding peas and what what he saw was

570
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,320
you know now i crossed the green with

571
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:03,678
the yellow and

572
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:06,558
some of those kids are green some of

573
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,559
those kids are yellow

574
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:10,960
and he did it with with color and with

575
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,440
wrinkle wrinkled peas

576
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:16,000
but it pretty much breaks down to for

577
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,759
every gene in a genome there are two

578
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,599
copies of it

579
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:22,000
and in some cases

580
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:24,000
the genes are dominant in some cases

581
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,880
they're recessive and it's it's possible

582
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,679
for

583
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,080
any

584
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,360
any two copies to one be dominant one be

585
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:32,399
recessive

586
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:34,240
um and so

587
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,400
when you you make a cross let's say you

588
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,839
have a parent that is dominant dominant

589
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,038
with something that is recessive

590
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:40,879
recessive

591
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:42,720
everything all of those progeny are

592
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,559
going to be what we call heterozygous

593
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,600
meaning it has a dominant allele and

594
00:20:44,558 --> 00:20:48,960
also has the recessive allele

595
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:50,879
however when you're dealing with things

596
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,038
that are heterozygous

597
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,400
when you go to make additional crosses

598
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:57,038
say with something that's completely

599
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,720
recessive or or something that's

600
00:20:57,038 --> 00:21:01,200
completely dominant you start to get

601
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,960
different ratios of those those children

602
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:06,240
so what we witnessed was just sort of a

603
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:08,480
a classic example of a gene segregating

604
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:11,759
in a dominant recessive fashion

605
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:13,519
um that sort of clarifies things yeah

606
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:15,200
that brings back some

607
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:17,519
some memories there yeah that does make

608
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:21,679
sense so basically things played out the

609
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:24,720
way you would expect them to um

610
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:27,038
from the from your your crosses

611
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,960
and then uh so you took those crosses

612
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:32,158
and what did that uh

613
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,159
what did that research show you

614
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:39,200
um so what that showed us was that

615
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:40,879
um

616
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:44,159
well just because the pattern of the

617
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,360
progeny just gave us okay there is a

618
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:47,520
single

619
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:49,279
dominant r gene uh so that that sort of

620
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:52,480
confirms what we call

621
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:54,798
vertical resistance um to to the the

622
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,240
pathogen that we're working with

623
00:21:54,798 --> 00:21:59,119
um and this is this is something that's

624
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:01,759
been found in you know it's pretty

625
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:05,439
common in domesticated crops that you

626
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:07,839
find a single dominant resistance gene

627
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,120
um and so so that that's sort of you

628
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:10,879
know

629
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:12,719
paul looked at the data and said okay we

630
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,440
should do some sequencing here

631
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:18,480
um because we can find a marker that

632
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,360
will associate with this this dominant

633
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,038
um

634
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:23,359
powdery mildew

635
00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:25,759
resistant gene

636
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:28,000
so so basically what you're saying is

637
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:28,798
this gave you the confidence that you

638
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,599
could

639
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:33,119
actually find a particular marker

640
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:34,959
based on

641
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:36,558
the cross that you did

642
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,038
is that essentially yeah

643
00:22:36,558 --> 00:22:42,158
that's correct okay

644
00:22:39,038 --> 00:22:44,798
uh so you you discovered this marker

645
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:48,559
um which is essentially what what the

646
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:48,558
the paper is about um

647
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,559
what uh

648
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:54,480
what does the research show you um

649
00:22:52,558 --> 00:22:56,798
when you guys use the word resistance

650
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,000
for example example in the paper

651
00:22:56,798 --> 00:22:59,839
um

652
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,759
what does that actually mean like let's

653
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:03,279
just say visually

654
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:04,480
and then how do you

655
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:06,240
i know you talked about this in the

656
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:09,360
paper but how do you show that this

657
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:11,839
plant is indeed resistant

658
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:13,519
yeah so um

659
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:16,399
you know sort of to identify powdery

660
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:18,558
mildew on on a crop you know it's

661
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:21,440
has these white little

662
00:23:18,558 --> 00:23:23,359
pears that grow all over the uh the

663
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:26,080
leaves it sort of looks like you took a

664
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:27,519
powder uh powdered sugar shaker and just

665
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:29,678
put them all over the leaves that's how

666
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:32,879
you can identify it once it's already

667
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:36,080
started to to uh colonize the toast

668
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:38,240
um so yeah visually we just had this

669
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:41,278
this set of children from from our

670
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:43,519
breeding cross and you know

671
00:23:41,278 --> 00:23:45,919
almost every other one

672
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:48,158
had powdery mildew growing on it or had

673
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,120
no powdery mildew there was it was

674
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,880
you know

675
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:52,158
um

676
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,240
it was just leaves there was there was

677
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:56,000
none of that powdery powdered sugar on

678
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,278
it so what we did was you know we took

679
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,278
some of that that

680
00:23:57,278 --> 00:24:00,960
powdery mildew off we examined it under

681
00:23:59,278 --> 00:24:03,278
a microscope

682
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,880
um and

683
00:24:03,278 --> 00:24:07,759
that's sort of the classic way of

684
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,600
identifying a a pathogen is to look at

685
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:11,839
it under the microscope you know you go

686
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:13,359
back and reference various textbooks or

687
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:16,240
resources

688
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:19,759
and so you identify the spores and you

689
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,558
identify um

690
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:20,809
the

691
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:23,599
the

692
00:24:20,809 --> 00:24:26,240
[Music]

693
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:28,319
pondium is sort of the scientific word

694
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,880
but sort of um

695
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:32,960
the the legs growing off

696
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,640
the off of the spores

697
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,319
which is sort of how the the fungus

698
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,320
grows

699
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:40,639
um

700
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:42,639
and you know we then took it next a step

701
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,559
further we took this isolated powdery

702
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,800
mildew at this point and we did a quick

703
00:24:44,558 --> 00:24:48,639
pcr test and

704
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:51,519
[Music]

705
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:53,600
and was able to confirm that it was the

706
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:56,879
this specific

707
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:56,879
species of powdery mildew

708
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:02,239
and then basically

709
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:04,400
all of the plants that had

710
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,880
uh that weren't showing any powdery

711
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:09,360
mildew all had contained that marker and

712
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:12,000
the ones that did have uh pm did not

713
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:14,479
contain that marker

714
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:18,558
yeah so this is where we we went and did

715
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:19,440
some um it's called a sniff probe um

716
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:21,599
it's

717
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,640
smith fnp short

718
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:25,119
um

719
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:28,400
sorry single nucleotide polymorphism if

720
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:29,278
you've ever taken a 23andme or ancestry

721
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,559
uh

722
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:33,359
dna test your your dna was run on a snip

723
00:25:32,558 --> 00:25:34,960
chip

724
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:36,558
um and so what this does is it

725
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,840
identifies single mutations throughout

726
00:25:36,558 --> 00:25:41,599
the entire genome so there are cannabis

727
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:44,639
specific snip chips and and we worked

728
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:47,119
with lighthouse genomics out of canada

729
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:49,278
for for this specific project and so we

730
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:51,599
ran dna samples from all of these

731
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:53,038
children in addition to the parents

732
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:54,798
um

733
00:25:53,038 --> 00:25:56,640
and just looked for mutations throughout

734
00:25:54,798 --> 00:25:58,639
the population

735
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:01,038
and so what we saw with you know i think

736
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:03,440
there was 40 000

737
00:26:01,038 --> 00:26:05,278
markers that were run but on one of the

738
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:08,080
markers we saw

739
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:11,038
okay in the parent

740
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:14,240
in in pnw 39 the resistant parent there

741
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:16,079
was this uh mutation at this specific

742
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,640
marker in

743
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:20,558
jumping jack the resistance i'm sorry

744
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,960
the susceptible parent

745
00:26:20,558 --> 00:26:25,359
there was a different mutation at that

746
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,919
that marker and then we saw that the

747
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:30,158
children split into three groups

748
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:32,080
um where they had

749
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:34,559
the profile that matched the resistant

750
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:36,319
parent the profile that matched the

751
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:38,399
the susceptible parent and then things

752
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:40,879
in between that had and this goes back

753
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,919
to those alleles each copy where they

754
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:46,000
had one

755
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:47,440
of each of the mutation at that that

756
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,079
genetic marker

757
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:52,240
um and so then we we took that data we

758
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:55,119
looked back at sort of our phenotyping

759
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:58,159
data what we saw with our eyes

760
00:26:55,119 --> 00:27:00,239
and we were able to determine that okay

761
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:03,120
this is a

762
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:05,038
dominant trait meaning that it you know

763
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:07,038
it's either dominant or recessive if

764
00:27:05,038 --> 00:27:10,158
it's dominant it's going to show

765
00:27:07,038 --> 00:27:11,759
um in the presence of of the recessive

766
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:13,840
um

767
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:16,640
and so we saw this pattern where some of

768
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:18,158
the progeny went uh

769
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,559
clustered with with the resistant parent

770
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:21,760
and of the same same mutation profile at

771
00:27:20,558 --> 00:27:24,000
that snip

772
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:24,960
we saw things that had in the middle and

773
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,960
then things that went with the

774
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:30,000
susceptible

775
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:32,798
so was this a spectrum of resistance

776
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,038
that you saw based on

777
00:27:32,798 --> 00:27:38,079
how much of that original

778
00:27:35,038 --> 00:27:40,879
pnw marker was there

779
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:43,439
with this particular population we did

780
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:46,240
not see a range of

781
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,759
resistance um just sort of

782
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,399
indicating that

783
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:53,679
this particular marker

784
00:27:50,398 --> 00:27:54,798
um is it infers strong resistance that

785
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:57,278
that i'm not going to say that's going

786
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:58,798
to be the case for every powdery powdery

787
00:27:57,278 --> 00:28:01,278
mildew resistance marker that might be

788
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:03,440
out there um right this is just pm1

789
00:28:01,278 --> 00:28:06,240
there's you know our geneticists believe

790
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:08,159
there's probably five or six in cannabis

791
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:11,519
and those remain to be found

792
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:13,679
um however with with pm1

793
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:15,679
if if you have the correct mutation in

794
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:17,759
that spot what we saw is that you have

795
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:20,559
full resistance to this strain of

796
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:20,558
powdery mildew

797
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,559
so what you're saying is there could be

798
00:28:22,398 --> 00:28:27,038
down the road other species or strains

799
00:28:24,558 --> 00:28:29,038
of pm that could still and potentially

800
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:31,119
infect a plant with this

801
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:32,798
with this marker but

802
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:35,599
what you saw

803
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:37,278
in your experiment was essentially full

804
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:40,319
immunity

805
00:28:37,278 --> 00:28:42,398
um in your growth chambers

806
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:44,558
yes that that's correct um i think i

807
00:28:42,398 --> 00:28:46,398
think it's very likely that there are

808
00:28:44,558 --> 00:28:48,798
other powdery mildew

809
00:28:46,398 --> 00:28:51,839
uh strains out there or species that

810
00:28:48,798 --> 00:28:52,960
could infect a a plant that is resistant

811
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:54,480
to this

812
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,480
the powdery mildew species that we were

813
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:59,759
working with

814
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:01,599
okay that makes sense um

815
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:03,839
and uh so

816
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:05,759
what kind of conclusions

817
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:07,759
can we draw so what like what's the next

818
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:10,319
logical step in regards to this research

819
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:12,879
and advanced advancement so

820
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:14,398
obviously for you guys um i would assume

821
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,640
now you're doing breeding projects where

822
00:29:14,398 --> 00:29:18,239
you're going to check for that marker as

823
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:21,038
you breed more of

824
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,480
you know progeny from these uh

825
00:29:21,038 --> 00:29:23,839
this these

826
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,839
this plant line

827
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:27,599
um

828
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:29,599
creating you know varietals then that i

829
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:32,000
assume you would you would then take to

830
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:33,839
market or potentially

831
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,519
sell down the road what's the

832
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:37,278
what's the game plan there and then how

833
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:39,440
can other growers outside of your

834
00:29:37,278 --> 00:29:41,759
company use this research or companies

835
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:45,038
to further advance

836
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:46,798
our overall knowledge in cannabis

837
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:48,960
yeah so some of the steps that we've

838
00:29:46,798 --> 00:29:50,798
taken uh the next steps we've taken with

839
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,880
with this project is of course we want

840
00:29:50,798 --> 00:29:54,480
this in all of our varieties that we put

841
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:57,360
into our commercial brand that we we

842
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,960
then sell to other farmers as well um so

843
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:01,359
at this time i believe we have just

844
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:03,360
about a dozen varieties that we have

845
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:04,879
introduced uh this powdery mildew

846
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:07,519
resistance into

847
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:09,278
um and those are available uh for for

848
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:10,960
washington growers

849
00:30:09,278 --> 00:30:12,960
and the other stuff that we're taking is

850
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:15,038
we want to find these other pm genes

851
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,679
right it's sort of a dream that we would

852
00:30:15,038 --> 00:30:19,839
uh start pm resistance genes pm two

853
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:21,200
three four five if there's that many

854
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:23,278
um

855
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:26,080
and and start to stack these resistance

856
00:30:23,278 --> 00:30:28,079
genes into a variety so like you

857
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:30,558
mentioned earlier right is it possible

858
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:32,398
for a farmer to have one of

859
00:30:30,558 --> 00:30:34,319
these these varieties and grow them and

860
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:37,038
still have powdery mildew resistance

861
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:39,200
um if we can get multiple resistance

862
00:30:37,038 --> 00:30:41,839
genes stacked into a single variety it

863
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,440
just lowers the chance that

864
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:45,359
powdery mildew can infect the plant no

865
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,360
matter where it's grown no matter what

866
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:50,759
species of pattern they'll do it's

867
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:50,759
subject to

868
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:54,558
and uh

869
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,240
that just gets me thinking do you have

870
00:30:54,558 --> 00:30:58,240
in line to do any research regarding

871
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:01,038
botrytis i know that's a

872
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:03,519
another major one that uh

873
00:31:01,038 --> 00:31:05,278
a lot of cannabis growers battle

874
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:08,399
even more so than pm is there a

875
00:31:05,278 --> 00:31:08,398
potential there i guess

876
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:13,759
um that's that's definitely not a focus

877
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:16,559
of ours you know i think unfortunately i

878
00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:18,480
mean it is it is definitely uh we are

879
00:31:16,558 --> 00:31:20,639
fortunate to be in this situation in

880
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,399
general but you know for the sake of

881
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:26,000
botrytis where we are we're in eastern

882
00:31:22,398 --> 00:31:27,119
washington uh botrytis isn't as big of a

883
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,839
threat

884
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:31,599
to cannabis out here it's a bit drier

885
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:32,480
um than say the willamette valley of

886
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:33,678
oregon

887
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,919
or you know

888
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:36,880
anywhere in western washington or even

889
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:40,240
you know

890
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:43,278
humble you know the emerald triangle in

891
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:45,599
california right as they get fall reigns

892
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:47,440
that increases the pressure of botrytis

893
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:49,678
so for us in eastern washington it's not

894
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,278
as big of a problem and

895
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:54,000
on the other side of that we don't want

896
00:31:51,278 --> 00:31:55,278
to intentionally bring botrytis into our

897
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,200
facility

898
00:31:55,278 --> 00:31:59,038
so we are

899
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,640
working with a few folks that that may

900
00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:02,720
or may not have

901
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:05,919
detritus resistance they think they do

902
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:07,759
um so we we work with folks on on sort

903
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:08,960
of trying to find this marker and then

904
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:11,038
sort of you know jumping back to your

905
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:15,278
question on you know how can other

906
00:32:11,038 --> 00:32:17,919
farmers uh make use of this today um

907
00:32:15,278 --> 00:32:19,519
you know what we did was develop a a

908
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:22,080
pcr assay

909
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:24,079
um and we we provide the primers for

910
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:26,319
that so you know of course you might

911
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:27,359
need a molecular biologist on your team

912
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:29,038
to sort of

913
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:30,959
run this assay but you know we did

914
00:32:29,038 --> 00:32:32,879
provide the framework for anybody to be

915
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,798
testing for this at their facility if

916
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,480
they have the right tools and

917
00:32:34,798 --> 00:32:38,319
staff

918
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,839
so i realize there's some limitations

919
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:41,918
with state

920
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:44,480
uh you know boundaries and such but if

921
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:45,278
you were a washington farmer for example

922
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,120
um

923
00:32:45,278 --> 00:32:48,640
could they send a sample to you to test

924
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:49,918
for that marker

925
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:52,240
is that something a service that you

926
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:53,679
guys offer

927
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,599
you know that's not a service that we

928
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:57,440
offer although if there's any interested

929
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:59,599
listeners out there you know we are very

930
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:02,240
happy to work with folks on ensuring

931
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:04,000
that consumers are getting a

932
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,839
safer product

933
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,640
in the end

934
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:09,278
and

935
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:11,600
but are you also and again this is

936
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:15,038
something i haven't looked up yet um do

937
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:16,480
you guys offer actual plants then um for

938
00:33:15,038 --> 00:33:19,599
sale

939
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:21,278
that contain that market yeah we

940
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:22,719
we we do we

941
00:33:21,278 --> 00:33:24,558
we can only work within the confines of

942
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,759
washington state at the moment

943
00:33:24,558 --> 00:33:27,678
um

944
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:29,519
but we we are very happy to work with

945
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:31,120
with folks on licensing our varieties

946
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:33,278
you know this past

947
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:34,959
growth season we worked with a large

948
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:37,440
group in central washington

949
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:40,079
uh getting them some of our varieties

950
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:42,080
um and this is what this is what we do

951
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:45,359
you know we we license plant varieties

952
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:47,038
to to interested farmers

953
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:49,278
great and that kind of just brings me to

954
00:33:47,038 --> 00:33:50,798
a couple more pm questions if that's

955
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:51,599
okay

956
00:33:50,798 --> 00:33:53,759
one

957
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:57,038
that comes to mind is have you seen any

958
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:59,759
research that actually shows uh

959
00:33:57,038 --> 00:34:00,640
any health risks associated

960
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:04,319
with

961
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:06,559
uh consuming or combusting

962
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:08,398
cannabis leaf that has

963
00:34:06,558 --> 00:34:10,639
some you know

964
00:34:08,398 --> 00:34:12,638
level of powdery mildew on it i wasn't

965
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:14,720
able to find anything online i was just

966
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:18,079
curious if you uh

967
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:20,559
if you had any anything on that

968
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:22,960
yeah i'm unaware of any research that

969
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:25,679
that shows that powdering mildew

970
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:28,960
consumption or inhalation is

971
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:31,200
dangerous to one's health um you know it

972
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:33,358
i'm not a medical doctor

973
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:34,878
but i think it's it's

974
00:34:33,358 --> 00:34:36,398
it's reasonable to think that it could

975
00:34:34,878 --> 00:34:37,440
elicit an immune response you know

976
00:34:36,398 --> 00:34:39,358
sometimes that could that could be in

977
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,559
the form of asthma or it could be a you

978
00:34:39,358 --> 00:34:41,440
know

979
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:43,119
uh

980
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:45,599
allergic reaction

981
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:47,119
um to the respiratory tract

982
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:49,200
but i think what's what's more important

983
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:52,000
here is that when powdery mildew is on

984
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:53,598
plants it reduces the vigor of the plant

985
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
ultimately impacting yield and in the

986
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:57,519
case of cannabis impacting potency and

987
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,519
that's not something that farmers want

988
00:34:57,519 --> 00:35:01,599
to have to deal with so oftentimes they

989
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:03,358
will treat their plants with damaging

990
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:05,760
fungicides

991
00:35:03,358 --> 00:35:07,679
and spray that on the plants and that is

992
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,000
that's my primary concern and that's a

993
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:11,039
huge poses a huge risk to

994
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,800
the

995
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:14,960
health and safety of cannabis consumers

996
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:18,320
is are they inhaling

997
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:19,440
combusted fungicides and pesticides

998
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,760
and that that's really our goal with

999
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:24,639
this is to just reduce depend reduce

1000
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,640
dependence on

1001
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:29,199
fungicides that are damaging to human

1002
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:31,680
health

1003
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:33,759
absolutely um and i just want to make

1004
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:36,799
clear i'm not condoning the use of like

1005
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:39,760
or the sale or or uh

1006
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:42,079
smoking or consumption of plants that

1007
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:43,680
have pm on them i would assume that any

1008
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:46,160
mold spores in general are probably

1009
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:47,759
things we want to keep out of our body

1010
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:49,440
but i was just curious if you'd actually

1011
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:51,440
found any research and then in regards

1012
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,880
to the fungicides

1013
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,559
it's an unfortunate reality that some

1014
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,838
people are still using things like eagle

1015
00:35:54,559 --> 00:36:00,320
20 you know

1016
00:35:56,838 --> 00:36:01,599
systemic fungicides and pesticides so

1017
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:04,960
i think that's a wonderful point that

1018
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:04,960
you bring up there in that regard

1019
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:10,399
as i understand it you know any oil

1020
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:12,560
based or even water itself will kill pm

1021
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:15,440
it just won't keep it from coming back

1022
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:16,639
and reinfecting the plant um

1023
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,480
and and you've already elicited the

1024
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:20,078
stress response at that point from the

1025
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,838
plant so i assume it's more susceptible

1026
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:22,720
even than it was before you killed it so

1027
00:36:21,838 --> 00:36:24,239
it's something you're going to be

1028
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:25,199
continually

1029
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:26,639
fighting

1030
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:29,598
um

1031
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:30,960
would that be accurate

1032
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:32,320
yeah i think i think that's that's

1033
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,800
accurate there are there are other

1034
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:37,119
strategies out there other than you know

1035
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:39,280
innate plant immunity to to powdery

1036
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:41,440
mildew um but you know it just sort of

1037
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:43,440
goes back to you know it maybe it is an

1038
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,358
organic oil that you're spraying on your

1039
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,519
plants that um

1040
00:36:45,358 --> 00:36:50,159
you know it is

1041
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:52,079
keeping the uh the powdery mildew at bay

1042
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:54,239
however i mean you're still when you're

1043
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:56,640
doing that you are you know adulterating

1044
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:58,239
the the end product you know maybe

1045
00:36:56,639 --> 00:36:59,039
you know let's say you're using neem oil

1046
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:00,399
it's

1047
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:01,440
pretty widely used in the cannabis

1048
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,480
industry

1049
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,480
as a safe

1050
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:08,399
pesticide

1051
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,880
but not everybody reacts well to neem

1052
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:13,039
oil i mean it is a mixture of uh

1053
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,800
essential oils and sometimes essential

1054
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:16,239
oils can elicit a negative immune

1055
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,400
response in people

1056
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:20,159
um so while it is much much better than

1057
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:23,200
using you know something as dangerous as

1058
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:24,399
eagle 20 um you know it's

1059
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:26,239
it

1060
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:29,039
it's it's not going to remove your

1061
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:31,439
problem um and it does adulterate your

1062
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:32,880
end product

1063
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:36,079
yeah and i would just add that you know

1064
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:37,200
realistically um

1065
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:38,880
we're not we don't want to spray

1066
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:40,480
anything once the plant starts producing

1067
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,079
trichomes so once we get a couple weeks

1068
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,000
into flower

1069
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:45,440
you're pretty limited in what you are

1070
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,440
able to

1071
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:49,200
spray on a plant

1072
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,280
my preference i'll just throw this out

1073
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:54,399
here would probably be something like

1074
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:56,160
self-oil x or mineral oil based

1075
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,440
even though it's petroleum

1076
00:37:56,159 --> 00:37:59,519
based

1077
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:01,440
there's a lot more research to support

1078
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:03,838
that these products are

1079
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:05,920
safer and they don't leave a residue on

1080
00:38:03,838 --> 00:38:07,759
the leaf tissue

1081
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,920
more so even the neem

1082
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,920
but

1083
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:13,199
yeah i i hear what you're saying the

1084
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,760
less we have to spray not only is that a

1085
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:17,759
labor savings uh it's it's keeping us

1086
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,760
from having to adulterate the plant at

1087
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:23,920
all or potentially risk anything being

1088
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:25,839
on the leaf surface come harvest time

1089
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:28,400
you know a lot of people ask me

1090
00:38:25,838 --> 00:38:30,320
is powdery mildew systemic

1091
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,480
and i don't know if that's something you

1092
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:35,680
want to address i can kind of share my

1093
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:37,280
thoughts but i was kind of curious

1094
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:40,719
you know how you would how you would

1095
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:44,160
describe the life cycle of this of these

1096
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:44,159
set this set of fun fungus

1097
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:50,559
so sorry your question is is it systemic

1098
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:52,719
and

1099
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:54,799
what is the the general life cycle yeah

1100
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:56,639
yeah that's sort of what uh what a lot

1101
00:38:54,800 --> 00:39:01,119
of people

1102
00:38:56,639 --> 00:39:03,279
are asking regarding this this fungus

1103
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:05,200
yeah i would say um

1104
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:07,440
it doesn't

1105
00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:08,799
it's only systemic if if the the

1106
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,800
environment which you're maintaining

1107
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:13,359
clones or whatever is is sort of

1108
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:15,599
inundated with powdery mildew spores

1109
00:39:13,358 --> 00:39:17,440
um

1110
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:18,880
and what what what is the life cycle you

1111
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,679
know it's

1112
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:24,079
this is a fungus um

1113
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:25,598
generally

1114
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:27,599
fungi have

1115
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:29,599
two phases of their life they have their

1116
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:31,838
their sport producing phase and they

1117
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:33,200
have their sort of fruiting body

1118
00:39:31,838 --> 00:39:34,639
production phase

1119
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:35,838
um so you know

1120
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:38,480
what what

1121
00:39:35,838 --> 00:39:40,838
how this works is is you know spores are

1122
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:44,320
introduced to an environment where they

1123
00:39:40,838 --> 00:39:46,000
can grow and they'll they'll

1124
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:47,599
start producing it sort of looks like

1125
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,400
plant roots um

1126
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:51,760
you know these hyphae

1127
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,920
as they're called through whatever that

1128
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:56,320
that medium is sometimes it's

1129
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:58,720
soil sometimes it's something that's

1130
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,079
particularly carbohydrate rich like say

1131
00:39:58,719 --> 00:40:00,879
a rotting apple

1132
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:02,960
um

1133
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:06,720
or an apple it's rotting because the

1134
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,720
fungus is eating all the sugar

1135
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:11,598
and and once it gets to a point where

1136
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:13,519
the the hyphae or this

1137
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:15,920
you know the the fungus equivalent to

1138
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:18,159
roots is strong enough it will start to

1139
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:19,680
produce its fruiting bodies so in the

1140
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:21,598
case of mushrooms right it's the

1141
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:25,118
mushroom it comes out of the hyphae uh

1142
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:26,559
has this this fruiting head um and then

1143
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:29,599
that fruity head is actually what then

1144
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:30,719
produces the spores for the next cycle

1145
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:33,119
um

1146
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:34,239
and and so you know you'll see that

1147
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:36,640
um

1148
00:40:34,239 --> 00:40:39,039
sort of as as you know mushrooms that

1149
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:41,440
have gills um

1150
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:43,519
underneath right sort of your typical

1151
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,280
cremini or

1152
00:40:43,519 --> 00:40:48,159
um

1153
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:50,160
you know various mushrooms um they'll

1154
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:51,598
drop those spores out of those gills and

1155
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:53,759
then they get spread by the wind or by

1156
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:56,160
animals or insects

1157
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:58,160
and the life cycle continues so in the

1158
00:40:56,159 --> 00:40:59,199
in the case of cannabis and powdery

1159
00:40:58,159 --> 00:41:01,598
mildew

1160
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:03,679
yeah those spores can can be dormant for

1161
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:04,880
quite some time and when the conditions

1162
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:07,358
are ripe

1163
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:09,280
they can take over a population so i

1164
00:41:07,358 --> 00:41:10,719
wouldn't say it's systemic right if you

1165
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:13,440
take a clone

1166
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:14,239
and bring it to a clean environment um

1167
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,318
you know

1168
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:19,199
there's a moderate risk

1169
00:41:16,318 --> 00:41:20,719
that that plant could then become

1170
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:24,480
inundated with powdery mildew but only

1171
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:26,480
in the right conditions i think you know

1172
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:29,519
having a clean facility especially where

1173
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:32,639
you do your cloning is very important

1174
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:35,838
in not passing pattern milduan

1175
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:37,279
from generation to generation

1176
00:41:35,838 --> 00:41:38,480
yeah i was just gonna i mean you

1177
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,599
essentially

1178
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,358
uh

1179
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:43,599
better explain

1180
00:41:41,358 --> 00:41:44,960
my thoughts on it i guess uh it's not

1181
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:47,119
systemic but

1182
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,880
it can act in ways that are similar to

1183
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:51,599
something that would be systemic in the

1184
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:54,559
sense that uh the spores are dormant

1185
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:57,039
they may not be visually present um to

1186
00:41:54,559 --> 00:41:58,000
the naked eye so when you are cloning

1187
00:41:57,039 --> 00:41:59,920
you can

1188
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,400
while it's not living inside the leaf

1189
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:04,480
tissue the the

1190
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:07,200
the fungus itself does penetrate the

1191
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:09,920
leaf tissue and so um

1192
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:11,519
you just want to be uh very careful when

1193
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:14,000
you are cloning if you are cloning a

1194
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:16,159
plant that's had pm uh to really do a

1195
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:19,199
good job of

1196
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:20,960
spraying or treating it prior to cloning

1197
00:42:19,199 --> 00:42:23,519
and then even after cloning just to make

1198
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,800
sure that you're not

1199
00:42:23,519 --> 00:42:26,400
you know creating a situation where

1200
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:29,480
you're going to have spore pressure down

1201
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,480
the road

1202
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:32,480
exactly

1203
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:34,720
um

1204
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:36,800
well awesome hey i really appreciate you

1205
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:38,719
taking the time today to explain this

1206
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,079
research um

1207
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:42,838
was there anything else that you want to

1208
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:45,119
share regarding uh this paper dewey

1209
00:42:42,838 --> 00:42:48,239
scientific uh things that you guys have

1210
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:51,760
going on down the road um

1211
00:42:48,239 --> 00:42:51,759
or or future research

1212
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:56,318
yeah you know future research and i did

1213
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:57,919
mention that we're on the press or we're

1214
00:42:56,318 --> 00:42:59,759
looking for other powdery mildew genes

1215
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:02,079
and we we do think we have a couple

1216
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:05,760
other in hand right now um we're

1217
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:06,960
awaiting sequencing confirmation to just

1218
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,079
to see that

1219
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,079
um

1220
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:12,640
but you know i think

1221
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:14,400
my big takeaway here is is and i didn't

1222
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:16,239
even really touch on this but you know

1223
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,680
none of this would have been possible if

1224
00:43:16,239 --> 00:43:18,879
it weren't for uh sort of the

1225
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:20,000
collaborative

1226
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:22,318
um

1227
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,639
framework that we had with oregon cbd

1228
00:43:22,318 --> 00:43:27,199
you know i think uh because of cannabis

1229
00:43:24,639 --> 00:43:28,799
and history people are a little hesitant

1230
00:43:27,199 --> 00:43:31,118
to work with others

1231
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:33,119
um but look none of this would have been

1232
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:36,000
possible without them you know we we had

1233
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:38,400
the germplasm we had some of the

1234
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,400
key competencies to getting here and

1235
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:42,800
then oregon cbd was able to complement

1236
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:44,318
us in ways that you know we couldn't do

1237
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,079
in-house and i think this is just a

1238
00:43:44,318 --> 00:43:47,519
testament to you know what's possible

1239
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:48,560
when when folks in the cannabis

1240
00:43:47,519 --> 00:43:50,639
community

1241
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:53,119
uh work together you know we we can

1242
00:43:50,639 --> 00:43:54,480
achieve great things um and you know

1243
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:56,000
we're

1244
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,400
you know i'm a huge proponent of

1245
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,800
collaboration and sort of you know

1246
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:02,800
helping other people um

1247
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,480
improve their practice and and you know

1248
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,079
hopefully that leads to

1249
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:10,318
some more really cool discoveries like

1250
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:13,119
like what we found with uh working cbd

1251
00:44:10,318 --> 00:44:15,119
awesome yeah i really appreciate
