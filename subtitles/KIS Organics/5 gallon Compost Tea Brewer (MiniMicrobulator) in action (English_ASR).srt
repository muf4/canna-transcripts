00:00:00,469 --> 00:00:05,339
hey guys tad here with kiss organics I'm

2
00:00:03,209 --> 00:00:08,370
here today to demonstrate for you the 5

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:10,820
gallon mini micro bellator which is a 5

4
00:00:08,369 --> 00:00:13,018
gallon aerated compost tea brewer or

5
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:15,179
bioreactor it's got an air lift design

6
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:17,670
and it was manufactured originally by

7
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:19,469
Tim Wilson of microbe organics up in

8
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,820
Canada and he recently gave us the right

9
00:00:19,469 --> 00:00:23,759
to start making it here in the United

10
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:26,010
States so this is a here it's a really

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,710
simple design very very efficient it

12
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:30,300
makes wonderful compost tea and the

13
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:31,710
reason we want to make compost tea

14
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,410
ourselves is because we want it to be

15
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:35,489
fresh by making it yourself you can

16
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:37,949
ensure that you're getting good

17
00:00:35,488 --> 00:00:39,509
biological activity and diversity when

18
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,100
you buy stuff in the bottle it's not

19
00:00:39,509 --> 00:00:43,500
going to have that same level of

20
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,539
activity and diversity and you're not

21
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,070
going to get the same biomass so really

22
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:48,480
important that we make compost tea fresh

23
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,369
because what we're doing is creating

24
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:52,828
nutrient cycling we're extracting the

25
00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:55,049
microbes from our compost adding a food

26
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:57,000
source and this just creates the optimal

27
00:00:55,049 --> 00:00:59,608
environment by getting the most oxygen

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,929
that we can into the water which is

29
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:02,309
where all those microbes are because we

30
00:01:00,929 --> 00:01:05,640
want to select for aerobic

31
00:01:02,308 --> 00:01:08,700
microorganisms so essentially to use

32
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:11,310
this Brewer just gonna set it down into

33
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,840
the water and I've already dechlorinated

34
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,519
this water by leaving it out we just

35
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,079
have chlorine here in the Seattle area

36
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:18,840
so I don't need to worry about

37
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:20,129
chloramine all I have to do is let it

38
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,750
sit out and this water has been sitting

39
00:01:20,129 --> 00:01:24,060
here for like 4 or 5 days because I've

40
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:26,969
been so busy but you can also run the

41
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:29,009
brewer for 6 to 8 hours and that should

42
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:31,469
take care of it as well you can really

43
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:32,670
usually smell the chlorine which is a

44
00:01:31,469 --> 00:01:35,969
good way to tell if it's still in there

45
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:38,009
or use rainwater or some other source

46
00:01:35,969 --> 00:01:39,959
that's already had the chlorine or

47
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:40,700
chlorine or moved or never had it in the

48
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:43,798
first place

49
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:45,450
alright so I've just secured this unit

50
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:46,829
to the bottom using a bungee cord that

51
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,549
comes with it it just holds everything

52
00:01:46,828 --> 00:01:50,219
in place

53
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:52,229
and then all I need to do at this point

54
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:53,548
is plug it in to get it going and I'm

55
00:01:52,228 --> 00:01:55,859
just going to plug it in so you can hear

56
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:57,299
about how loud it is now the air pump

57
00:01:55,859 --> 00:01:58,978
needs to stay above the height of the

58
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:01,530
water that's really important so you can

59
00:01:58,978 --> 00:02:03,060
have it on a desk or somewhere nearby

60
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:04,409
it doesn't come with the buckets it

61
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,600
comes with everything else so we can

62
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:08,189
ship it much more affordably but it's

63
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:09,419
really easy to pick up a little bucket

64
00:02:08,189 --> 00:02:09,889
and home depot this will work with any

65
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:12,019
fine

66
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:13,429
gallon bucket all right so I'm gonna

67
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:15,050
plug it in here giving you idea of just

68
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:16,790
how noisy it is so you'll probably want

69
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:18,560
to run in your garage or in your

70
00:02:16,789 --> 00:02:31,729
greenhouse not necessarily in your

71
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:33,620
kitchen or in your room all right so

72
00:02:31,729 --> 00:02:35,329
that's it running I'm just talking to

73
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:37,009
give you an idea of the level of volume

74
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:38,600
that you're hearing you can't stick

75
00:02:37,009 --> 00:02:40,340
something underneath the air pump to

76
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:42,139
help reduce some of the air pump boys

77
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:44,569
we're really most of the noise is just

78
00:02:42,139 --> 00:02:46,429
the water it's really important that the

79
00:02:44,569 --> 00:02:47,659
water makes that noise because what it's

80
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:49,969
doing is it comes out of here it's

81
00:02:47,659 --> 00:02:51,560
breaking the surface tension of the

82
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:55,159
water which raises your dissolved oxygen

83
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:56,930
levels now once it's running if we want

84
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:59,539
to use if you have one of our group it's

85
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:01,590
squeezing artpop whiskey it's really

86
00:02:59,539 --> 00:03:03,189
simple all you have to do at that point

87
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:05,750
[Applause]

88
00:03:03,189 --> 00:03:08,060
is take it out this is our food story

89
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:10,939
this is a microbe catalyst and a small

90
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:12,590
amount of organic alfalfa meal and just

91
00:03:10,939 --> 00:03:14,769
take that and sprinkle it right into the

92
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,769
water

93
00:03:19,879 --> 00:04:07,229
is using our other there you go

94
00:04:05,789 --> 00:04:20,279
additional questions about the homeless

95
00:04:07,229 --> 00:04:21,629
please check out our blog post page I'm

96
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:24,029
gonna plug that so you guys can hear me

97
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:26,009
I was just gonna say we do have a

98
00:04:24,029 --> 00:04:28,349
compost tea guide available for free

99
00:04:26,009 --> 00:04:29,639
it's a 17 page guide right there on our

100
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:32,010
website so you can learn more about

101
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:33,449
compost tea should answer any and all

102
00:04:32,009 --> 00:04:35,459
your questions I just want to give you

103
00:04:33,449 --> 00:04:39,500
an idea of the microview later in action

104
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:39,500
all right have a great day thanks
