welcome to the Cannabis cultivation and

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,300
science podcast I'm your host Tad Hussey

5
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:26,219
of Kiss Organics this is the podcast

6
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,900
where we discuss The Cutting Edge of

7
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:30,118
growing from a science-based perspective

8
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:31,559
and drawn top experts from around the

9
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:33,719
industry to share their wisdom and

10
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:36,299
knowledge my guest this week is Bryant

11
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:38,340
Mason Bryant is a certified crop advisor

12
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:40,319
who specializes in organic cannabis

13
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,879
nutrition he has spent the last four

14
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,100
years working to combine Precision

15
00:00:41,878 --> 00:00:45,899
laboratory techniques with data science

16
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,700
in an effort to unravel the complexities

17
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:50,520
of cannabis soil and crop nutrition

18
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:52,140
along with his work on soilless media he

19
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,700
also helps outdoor cultivators around

20
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,739
the United States with nutrient

21
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,539
management and cover cropping if you

22
00:00:55,738 --> 00:00:59,820
would like to do soil testing help with

23
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:01,739
interpreting a soil test or interested

24
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,700
in an online course on these subjects

25
00:01:01,738 --> 00:01:06,959
his website is

26
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:09,240
www.soildoctorconsulting.com now on to

27
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:10,919
the show

28
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:13,019
hey Brian thanks for coming on the show

29
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,780
today

30
00:01:13,019 --> 00:01:18,000
thanks for having me Chad

31
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,379
yeah absolutely

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,719
um I know you've been on the show

33
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:23,938
multiple times here and people are

34
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:26,219
listeners probably familiar with who you

35
00:01:23,938 --> 00:01:28,379
are and what you do

36
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:30,900
um so let's just go ahead and Dive Right

37
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:34,019
In we had talked uh before the show

38
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:36,540
about one of one of my recent podcasts

39
00:01:34,019 --> 00:01:38,699
with Paul coxon and Patrick veezy

40
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,259
talking about phosphorus and that was a

41
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,540
topic that kind of sparked some interest

42
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:43,680
in you

43
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:45,479
do you want to share some of your your

44
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,820
feedback or some of your thoughts from

45
00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:50,938
from that podcast

46
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:53,459
sure well first off I just want to say

47
00:01:50,938 --> 00:01:56,219
that whenever I see any

48
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:58,798
research related to cannabis nutrient

49
00:01:56,219 --> 00:02:02,039
management I'm thrilled because it's

50
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:05,100
just so many decades behind that and and

51
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:07,259
there are so so many questions and uh so

52
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:09,000
if you answer scientifically at least in

53
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:10,439
the research research literature that I

54
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,539
just love seeing that kind of content so

55
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:15,300
I did listen to it I loved it

56
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:17,818
um I think my dominant takeaway is and

57
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:20,879
I'm sure you share this is a little bit

58
00:02:17,818 --> 00:02:23,458
of disappointment in the fact that all

59
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:25,859
the nutrient research in cannabis

60
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:26,598
production that I've seen is

61
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,580
um

62
00:02:26,598 --> 00:02:32,818
non-organic and that changes things so

63
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:34,319
dramatically the target nutrient levels

64
00:02:32,818 --> 00:02:36,060
that those researchers were taught

65
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:37,738
researchers were talking about were so

66
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:40,259
much higher than anything that I ever

67
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:42,420
see in organic living soil systems so it

68
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:44,519
was tough for me to use their target

69
00:02:42,419 --> 00:02:46,318
numbers to ascertain any information

70
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:48,000
about you know what we're seeing in

71
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:49,500
organic soils

72
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,878
um so that was my first thing and all

73
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,759
the research that I've been reading is

74
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:55,079
mostly in Hydro Solutions it makes sense

75
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:57,859
from a research standpoint because

76
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:03,239
they're able to control more variables

77
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:06,360
using soilless media and ionic nutrients

78
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:08,099
um but it's a little tough to to pull

79
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,040
numbers from it they were applying

80
00:03:08,098 --> 00:03:13,318
hundreds of PPM of of soluble phosphorus

81
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:15,598
in one of their studies and and the

82
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:19,139
interesting thing I remember hearing was

83
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:20,699
that they weren't seeing any uh negative

84
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:23,279
they weren't seeing a negative yield

85
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:26,039
from huge whopping amounts of phosphorus

86
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,500
which I've sort of observed that as well

87
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:31,199
I don't recommend super high phosphorus

88
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:34,139
levels but I haven't seen really

89
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:36,959
elevated soil or tissue phosphorus

90
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:39,419
levels create any zinc iron or manganese

91
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,900
deficiencies at least not very clearly

92
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:45,559
so that did add up to what I've seen

93
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,560
working with Growers

94
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,879
now when you look on Mulder's chart for

95
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:52,798
example which shows sort of the

96
00:03:49,878 --> 00:03:55,139
antagonisms and and such associated with

97
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:58,920
various nutrients you'll see that that

98
00:03:55,139 --> 00:04:01,500
phosphorus does have uh an antagonistic

99
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:04,199
relationship I believe with iron and and

100
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,818
zinc I think and a couple other elements

101
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:07,079
but yet

102
00:04:05,818 --> 00:04:08,939
um I've heard you talk about how it's

103
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:12,180
it's sort of a luxury

104
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:14,459
uh nutrient in that we you're not seeing

105
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:16,978
those sorts of issues with high levels

106
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:18,959
can you kind of expand on that

107
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:21,719
yeah you know Mulder's chart has always

108
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,160
been a source of Fascination for me

109
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,139
um because

110
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,540
I've always wondered

111
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:29,100
how it was developed what crops they

112
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,080
were using because there are certain

113
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:33,840
antagonisms that show up very quickly

114
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:36,180
and very aggressively in different crops

115
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:40,879
um and not in others so for whatever

116
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:43,680
reason uh cannabis doesn't seem to

117
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:45,418
exhibit these types of antagonisms as

118
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,360
quickly and as easily as something like

119
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:49,560
maybe a corn or soybean crop wood so um

120
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,939
I think that probably explains the

121
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,519
difference with the molars charge kind

122
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:55,740
of depends on how it was uh created

123
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:58,159
usually and I've seen this in other crop

124
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:01,199
types I've I've seen zinc deficiencies

125
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,240
that are from excess phosphorus

126
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,560
application

127
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,918
um but like I said I just haven't

128
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,600
necessarily seen that in in cannabis now

129
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:11,639
there are other reactions too that may

130
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,740
happen in the soil so for with calcium

131
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:15,720
calcium phosphate is a classic insoluble

132
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:18,960
precipitate that can happen with with

133
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:20,460
really elevated levels of of phosphorus

134
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:22,620
but in organic systems most of that

135
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:24,478
phosphorus that we're applying is either

136
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:28,019
through compost soft rock phosphate or

137
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:29,399
bone meal so um it's not in these highly

138
00:05:28,019 --> 00:05:30,959
soluble forms that are going to

139
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:32,879
precipitate out

140
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:35,879
um in the soil as easily and that's why

141
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:38,699
on a standard soil test you might see a

142
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:40,319
pretty large amount of phosphate but

143
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:42,300
you're not going to see as much in the

144
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:45,839
solution solution the only time I see

145
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:47,879
very elevated soluble phosphorus numbers

146
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:51,679
is when people are using phosphoric acid

147
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:54,360
to usually to PH down their water

148
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,038
or I just want to add on that if they're

149
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,900
using fish hydrolyzate or something

150
00:05:56,038 --> 00:06:00,418
that's stabilized with phosphoric acid

151
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:02,939
I've also seen that and then the last

152
00:06:00,418 --> 00:06:06,839
time I've seen it is in soil mixes that

153
00:06:02,939 --> 00:06:08,699
have a lot of bat guano high phosphorus

154
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:09,779
baguano which you and I were talking

155
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:10,860
about

156
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:13,859
um

157
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:16,139
prior to the show starting so

158
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:18,660
yeah you can see in Organics where

159
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:20,639
what's causing it and that that to me

160
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:22,319
always really stands out when you have a

161
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,199
really high available phosphorus number

162
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:27,660
on your saturated paste but

163
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,939
on that note I consistently have Growers

164
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:32,520
with quite low available P you know like

165
00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:34,918
0.5 for example on the saturated paste

166
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:37,318
and yet we're not seeing P deficiencies

167
00:06:34,918 --> 00:06:39,779
necessarily in the plant at least

168
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:41,759
visually and yields seem seem to be

169
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:43,619
quite good still

170
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,139
um what are your thoughts on all that

171
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:47,939
yes that's a fascinating one I've always

172
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:50,280
uh

173
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:53,519
found that phosphorus is one of the

174
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:55,918
least accurate nutrients to manage based

175
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:57,779
on soil test results it helps to have

176
00:06:55,918 --> 00:07:01,560
the standard tests and the pace test in

177
00:06:57,779 --> 00:07:03,239
the case of phosphate I actually put a

178
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,500
little bit more weight on the standard

179
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:08,460
test when it comes to looking at

180
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:11,220
phosphorus because of phosphorus

181
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:13,620
Dynamics are very biologically driven so

182
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:15,539
the general theory that I work off of is

183
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:17,240
if you can have a large enough reservoir

184
00:07:15,538 --> 00:07:19,139
of phosphorus in your soil

185
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,598
microorganisms are mineralizing

186
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:23,579
phosphate and delivering to the plant

187
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:25,800
delivering them to the plant root pretty

188
00:07:23,579 --> 00:07:27,240
efficiently and so it's very rare in

189
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,879
natural ecosystems and in Agro

190
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:32,460
ecosystems for soluble phosphorus levels

191
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:34,259
to accumulate to very high levels the

192
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:35,399
other issue is in a new soil it's been

193
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:37,020
sitting in the bag a lot of that

194
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:38,638
phosphorus is mineralized and so you

195
00:07:37,019 --> 00:07:40,500
might see three or four parts per

196
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,060
million on the pace test but as soon as

197
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:44,579
you water it and as soon as those plants

198
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:46,800
start growing it usually drops and

199
00:07:44,579 --> 00:07:49,198
without supplemental feeds yeah 0.3

200
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,180
0.4.5 is usually what you see on the

201
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,340
pace test and I've seen very little

202
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:55,379
correlation

203
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:57,239
to what ultimately matters which is the

204
00:07:55,379 --> 00:07:59,159
plant tissue and so as long as levels

205
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,860
are sufficient on the on the tissue test

206
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,699
that's all I care about so really you

207
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:05,038
know

208
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:06,360
I have a range of phosphorus on tissue

209
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:09,300
and as long as it's in that range and

210
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:11,699
ideally on the high end of that range I

211
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:13,800
have no concerns whatsoever I will say

212
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:16,020
that there is a correlation between

213
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:18,000
sufficient tissue levels and what's seen

214
00:08:16,019 --> 00:08:20,878
on that standard test in pounds per acre

215
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,160
of phosphate so I really like to keep I

216
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:27,139
like to slowly build phosphorus levels

217
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:29,939
in soil until that number is sufficient

218
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:31,740
well my next podcast that I'm actually

219
00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:34,559
recording later this week is with Dr

220
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:35,940
Carrie Peters over at Jack's fertilizer

221
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:39,239
she's the chemist over there talking

222
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:41,039
about tissue testing specifically so

223
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,680
we'll definitely dive into that more for

224
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:45,419
listeners here really soon which I'm I'm

225
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:47,159
excited about

226
00:08:45,419 --> 00:08:50,519
um but I want to I want to talk to you

227
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:54,539
about the the uh

228
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:56,700
phosphorus number on the standard test

229
00:08:54,539 --> 00:09:00,240
on the Malik 3 test

230
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:02,399
um how is that tied or is it tied to the

231
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,399
exchange capacity of the soil and then I

232
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:07,679
want to kind of dive into

233
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:11,120
CEC TCC and sort of

234
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:13,559
what what those challenges are with um

235
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,320
you know what we're calling living soils

236
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:19,018
soilless media versus actual soil

237
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:22,700
yeah great so

238
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:27,299
um most phosphorus in a peat-based media

239
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:28,980
is not on any exchange sites a lot of

240
00:09:27,299 --> 00:09:31,019
it's tied up in compost and so as

241
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:35,039
microbes slowly decompose that compost

242
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:38,778
it's released it's also tied up in rock

243
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:41,099
phosphate minerals and different

244
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:44,159
animal-based meals like I said fishbone

245
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:47,639
meal or just standard bone meal and

246
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:49,039
usually agronomically the traditional

247
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:52,199
um

248
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:54,659
CEC definition is

249
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:57,060
more focused on the soil's ability to

250
00:09:54,659 --> 00:09:59,639
hold cations and phosphate is actually a

251
00:09:57,059 --> 00:10:03,059
negatively charged anion so it's it's

252
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:06,720
not usually very related to the CEC

253
00:10:03,059 --> 00:10:10,319
um so the CEC cation exchange capacity

254
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:13,500
is the the interesting thing about CEC

255
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:16,080
on a soil test especially on peat-based

256
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:19,080
media is it's actually a calculation

257
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:22,139
it's not a direct measurement so what I

258
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:24,300
mean by that is is usually if you're if

259
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:26,939
a soil test comes back they're directly

260
00:10:24,299 --> 00:10:29,819
measuring how much calcium and nitrogen

261
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:31,680
and zinc are in that soil they're using

262
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:34,260
a machine called an ICP and they're

263
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:35,338
directly measuring the parts per million

264
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:36,720
of that

265
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:40,320
nutrient

266
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,879
and with Tec or CEC they're sort of

267
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,740
synonymous

268
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:47,039
it's actually a calculation that's

269
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:49,680
adding calcium magnesium potassium and

270
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:52,319
sodium together the cationic uh

271
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:53,819
macronutrients and making some small

272
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,959
adjustments for

273
00:10:53,820 --> 00:11:00,060
other bases and hydrogen but but it's a

274
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:02,159
it's a calculation that's summing all of

275
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:05,518
those cations extracted in the melee 3

276
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:07,679
solution and so the Malik 3 has a pH of

277
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:10,019
2.5 it's dissolving those into solution

278
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:12,179
and the lab just adds them all up based

279
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:15,600
on what the the numbers of nutrients are

280
00:11:12,179 --> 00:11:19,559
and the reason that this is a problem is

281
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:21,600
because usually in traditional agronomic

282
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:25,799
calculations you apply more nutrients to

283
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:30,778
a higher uh CEC soil so in a peat-based

284
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:33,659
media you're gonna see higher CEC when

285
00:11:30,778 --> 00:11:34,799
you have more cationic nutrients and so

286
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:36,958
you

287
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:38,278
will apply more nutrients and you keep

288
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:40,078
applying more and more and all of a

289
00:11:38,278 --> 00:11:41,820
sudden you've over applied so it's a bit

290
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:43,559
of a positive feedback loop so that's

291
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:46,019
one issue

292
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:49,439
um so how I look at the the CEC

293
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:51,778
measurement is more of a more of a of an

294
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,220
almost like an EC measurement but just

295
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:57,120
for the cations

296
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:59,940
if that makes sense because usually CEC

297
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:03,299
was developed for for mineral Topsoils

298
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:06,260
and especially acidic Topsoils about any

299
00:12:03,299 --> 00:12:09,719
excess mineral salts and these cations

300
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:11,639
are are essentially binding to to Clay

301
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,940
particles the negatively charged site

302
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:17,759
sites on clay and so

303
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:19,860
um when you add all of those together it

304
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:21,958
gives you a pretty good sense of of all

305
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:24,259
of those sites in the soil but in in

306
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:27,299
soilless Media or in peat-based media

307
00:12:24,259 --> 00:12:29,519
that's not really how it works most of

308
00:12:27,299 --> 00:12:31,979
those cations exist in compost or

309
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:34,679
minerals or just floating around and in

310
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:37,019
the in the media Matrix

311
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:38,759
foreign yeah so I have some questions

312
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:39,480
about that so

313
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:43,980
um

314
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:45,899
anecdotally when I see a high exchange

315
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,519
capacity I'll see

316
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:49,740
um

317
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:51,959
I'll see higher levels of our cations

318
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:55,379
you know calcium magnesium potassium

319
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:58,319
sodium but I also tend to see higher

320
00:12:55,379 --> 00:13:01,078
phosphate and sulfur levels is that just

321
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,820
because on average when Growers are when

322
00:13:01,078 --> 00:13:04,019
we're seeing those High cation levels

323
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:06,180
it's just Growers are probably over

324
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:08,578
applying p and S2 they're not actually

325
00:13:06,179 --> 00:13:12,000
tied in any way mathematically to that

326
00:13:08,578 --> 00:13:14,519
calculation you nailed it so

327
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
um you know when you apply to get high

328
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:20,100
calcium or to get high magnesium

329
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,440
or pet potassium you they're usually

330
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:24,300
applied in the form of you know gypsum

331
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:26,339
or potassium sulfate or even just

332
00:13:24,299 --> 00:13:29,099
compost right that brings in all the

333
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:30,899
nutrients in a package so nutrient

334
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,759
levels tend to be correlated because in

335
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:34,500
organic production we're we're sort of

336
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:36,720
applying then

337
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,519
um together even if it's just gypsum

338
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,379
it's still calcium and sulfur together

339
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:41,940
so you'll see both of those levels climb

340
00:13:40,379 --> 00:13:43,919
simultaneously but you're you're right

341
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:48,000
on with the the math is not connected

342
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:49,799
Tec in any anion is not connected

343
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,980
okay and then the way I've always

344
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:55,139
thought of CEC is like uh a giant sponge

345
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:57,000
so like what's the soil like when we're

346
00:13:55,139 --> 00:14:00,019
talking about actual soil here like sand

347
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:03,600
silk Clays ability to retain

348
00:14:00,019 --> 00:14:06,659
nutrients cations and so the higher the

349
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,159
CEC the more clay in there uh the more

350
00:14:06,659 --> 00:14:10,259
nutrients it's going to take for that

351
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:11,879
soil to be saturated and have a lot of

352
00:14:10,259 --> 00:14:13,439
like plant available fertility so

353
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:15,838
there's there's pros and cons to high

354
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,600
sea soil a low sea soil let's say like

355
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,680
Sandy soils in Florida for example

356
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,300
um you're going to be constantly

357
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:22,799
applying low levels of nutrients because

358
00:14:21,299 --> 00:14:24,240
it's not it doesn't have any ability to

359
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:27,539
retain those nutrients for the plant

360
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,879
however if your CEC in actual soil is

361
00:14:27,539 --> 00:14:31,980
quite High you may have to apply a lot

362
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:33,539
of nutrients just to move the needle a

363
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:36,480
little bit and maintain

364
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:37,860
fertility is that an okay way of

365
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,440
describing anything you would change or

366
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:42,959
tweak in that sort of Layman's

367
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:44,579
definition I think that's a pretty good

368
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:47,939
way to think about it

369
00:14:44,578 --> 00:14:49,919
um a sponge is a good analogy I've also

370
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:52,139
often seen like a dinner plate you know

371
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:53,698
and you can like only hold so many ions

372
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:56,519
on that dinner plate and the dinner

373
00:14:53,698 --> 00:14:59,159
plate is representing a clay colloid

374
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:01,799
um I think I think Brandon or someone

375
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:03,600
who works for you in an email to me uh

376
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:05,698
referred to them as docking sites which

377
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,820
I really liked there's only so many

378
00:15:05,698 --> 00:15:11,519
docking sites on a clay mineral and

379
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:12,959
these cations can attach and once all

380
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,120
the docking sites are full there's

381
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:17,359
nowhere for these ions to attach and so

382
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,879
they'll Leach out of the soil over time

383
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,620
and that's why

384
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:25,740
agronomically you really assume that

385
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:27,480
there's no excess ions in the soil that

386
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:28,980
don't aren't cations that aren't

387
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,899
attached to a docking site because

388
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:32,639
they've all leached out and so if you

389
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:35,399
extract all the cations and add them up

390
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:37,500
then you have a really good estimate of

391
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:39,539
how much how many docking sites there

392
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:42,179
are in your soil and so I think that was

393
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:43,559
a good explanation and I think um it's

394
00:15:42,179 --> 00:15:45,958
just a tough thing to apply to

395
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:48,000
peat-based Media because those docking

396
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:50,838
sites don't exist it's just a matrix of

397
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,879
peat and compost proper core

398
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:55,339
aggregate minerals and and so they're

399
00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:59,480
not actually

400
00:15:55,339 --> 00:15:59,480
exchanging in the traditional sense

401
00:15:59,698 --> 00:16:04,078
that that makes sense so it's really

402
00:16:01,379 --> 00:16:06,480
just a measure of your fertility in a

403
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:08,819
lot of ways it's not actually

404
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,139
um telling you what this there's no real

405
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:12,180
CEC there

406
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:15,000
um exactly but one one thing I don't

407
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:16,979
quite understand then is if the way the

408
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,778
lab measures It Is by measuring by

409
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:21,060
adding up all these cations

410
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:23,278
essentially to give you that number how

411
00:16:21,059 --> 00:16:26,338
do they how do they determine an actual

412
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:30,778
soil what a CEC is because a soil may

413
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:34,320
have a high CEC but have very little

414
00:16:30,778 --> 00:16:35,220
cations in it right at a given point in

415
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,920
time

416
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:40,320
how do they determine that

417
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:42,360
so

418
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,278
they they do the same thing they extract

419
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,480
all the cationic nutrients and then add

420
00:16:44,278 --> 00:16:46,919
them up

421
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,539
um and they adjust for atomic weight

422
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:49,860
they divide by other bases and

423
00:16:48,539 --> 00:16:51,120
exchangeable hydrogen so they're

424
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,440
accounting for a few other things but

425
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,198
the point is they add it all up and they

426
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:57,480
estimate the CEC but if

427
00:16:55,198 --> 00:17:00,359
um when you incorporate all of the

428
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:03,839
cations that we mentioned the nutrient

429
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:06,558
cations and hydrogen

430
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:11,699
um a soil with a

431
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:13,859
lows a high CEC with low nutrient levels

432
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:15,419
um will be acidic that's that's because

433
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:17,279
all of those exchange sites will be

434
00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:18,839
occupied by something and if they're not

435
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:21,298
occupied by calcium

436
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:23,519
magnesium potassium or sodium it's going

437
00:17:21,298 --> 00:17:25,980
to be hydrogen and so that soil will be

438
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:27,179
acidic so in a high CEC soil without a

439
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:29,519
lot of nutrients you're going to see a

440
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:32,220
lot of hydrogen ions but something is

441
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:33,839
going to occupy those exchange sites

442
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:35,400
that that makes a lot more sense to me

443
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:38,038
most of the soils that we work with are

444
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,419
pretty close to neutral so I don't see

445
00:17:38,038 --> 00:17:41,879
that as

446
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:43,620
as much but uh that that makes a lot of

447
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,880
sense so let's talk about that really

448
00:17:43,619 --> 00:17:47,038
quickly because there is that

449
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:50,880
exchangeable hydrogen uh that people

450
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:52,679
will see on the standard test and

451
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,860
you know it only shows up when you have

452
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:58,019
obviously acidic soils uh what does that

453
00:17:55,859 --> 00:17:59,879
number really tell us it doesn't

454
00:17:58,019 --> 00:18:01,980
honestly I've asked Logan to get rid of

455
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:04,799
it it's a it's a source of confusion

456
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:07,079
it's 100 correlated to pH so it'll be

457
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:09,960
zero with Pages above seven and it'll

458
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:13,619
tick up with ph's

459
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:15,419
um below seven and so it's really just a

460
00:18:13,619 --> 00:18:17,519
different way to look at pH and there's

461
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:21,799
no useful value to the percent

462
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:21,798
exchangeable hydrogen on the soil test

463
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:25,439
awesome

464
00:18:23,579 --> 00:18:29,519
um

465
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:34,380
let's let's move on to organic matter

466
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:37,558
yeah and how that relates to a soilless

467
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:38,880
media versus actual soil and what what

468
00:18:37,558 --> 00:18:42,660
Target should be

469
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:45,660
great so organic matter does involve a

470
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:48,538
direct measurement unlike CEC and the

471
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:51,960
measurement is is a is taken from a

472
00:18:48,538 --> 00:18:55,200
technique called loss on ignition which

473
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:56,400
um estimates organic matter based on the

474
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:00,360
weight change

475
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,919
of the soil after they heat it up to a

476
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:04,918
really high temperature I believe 800

477
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:07,380
degrees Fahrenheit so almost as hot as

478
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:09,240
you know a combustion flame

479
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:11,220
um and at that temperature there's a lot

480
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:13,500
of oxidation of of

481
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:15,298
organic matter and so they weigh the

482
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,099
sample before they weigh it after and

483
00:19:15,298 --> 00:19:19,139
essentially they're they're weighing how

484
00:19:17,099 --> 00:19:23,699
much carbon is lost that

485
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:25,340
at 800 Degrees in Topsoil that carbon is

486
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:29,460
primarily organic matter

487
00:19:25,339 --> 00:19:32,639
I believe organic matter is 58 carbon so

488
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:35,220
it's an inexpensive and it's an accurate

489
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,679
enough technique to be widely used in

490
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:39,900
soil testing it's really the best method

491
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:41,580
at scale for testing organic matter and

492
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:45,620
soil or at least estimating organic

493
00:19:41,579 --> 00:19:45,619
matter and it's it's pretty accurate

494
00:19:45,859 --> 00:19:49,439
in actual soil and mineral-based soils

495
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:50,639
if you go out in your backyard or

496
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,860
whatever

497
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,020
um in peat-based media there's two

498
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:58,859
problems here the first is that the

499
00:19:55,019 --> 00:20:00,779
carbon that is oxidized in in a

500
00:19:58,859 --> 00:20:02,279
peep-based media is not real organic

501
00:20:00,779 --> 00:20:05,099
matter it's primarily peat moss or

502
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:08,160
coca-core or immature compost those

503
00:20:05,099 --> 00:20:08,879
things aren't technically organic matter

504
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,480
um

505
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:15,179
in the same sense that it is in a real

506
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,400
mineral topsoil they're carbon based so

507
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:19,140
they show up as a big matter

508
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,340
they just behave differently is

509
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:22,320
essentially what you're getting at right

510
00:20:20,339 --> 00:20:25,199
yeah I mean they are organic matter

511
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:27,178
they're being that yeah it sort of

512
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,819
depends on how you define organic matter

513
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:32,880
but in in most I mean most soil

514
00:20:29,819 --> 00:20:34,079
scientists would characterize organic

515
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,760
matter

516
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:39,538
um at least what we're trying to get at

517
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:42,720
with organic matter is a long chain

518
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:45,480
carbon compound that has taken a long

519
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:48,179
time to form and is fairly recalcitrant

520
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:50,640
meaning it's it's doesn't decompose very

521
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:52,740
easily or very quickly and it provides

522
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,140
nutrients and a very sort of diverse

523
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:56,940
microbial habitat and so by that

524
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:58,320
definition peat moss doesn't really fit

525
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:00,179
because

526
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:01,740
um it doesn't have it's kind of a nerd

527
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:04,080
it doesn't have many nutrients it's not

528
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:07,859
it's like a totally different carbon

529
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:09,720
chain than like I mean the the

530
00:21:07,859 --> 00:21:12,058
this is sort of an Antiquated word but

531
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,860
humus you know is is this substance this

532
00:21:12,058 --> 00:21:15,960
magical sort of jet fuel in the soil

533
00:21:13,859 --> 00:21:17,519
it's totally different than that so yes

534
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,319
it's organic in nature in the sense that

535
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:21,779
it's made out of carbon but it doesn't

536
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:25,139
give us all the the plant health and

537
00:21:21,779 --> 00:21:27,960
agronomic benefits that true long-chain

538
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:29,640
organic matter does in the soil

539
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,679
um it doesn't give us all the benefits

540
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:33,000
when it turns over and when it changes

541
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,440
form

542
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,659
um so it's just a totally different

543
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:38,279
species of carbon

544
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:40,740
so

545
00:21:38,279 --> 00:21:42,839
when we look at the organic matter on a

546
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:44,759
peat-based media

547
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:47,399
um it's not it's really just kind of

548
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:49,679
showing us the weight loss and that gets

549
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:51,360
to the second issue which is the

550
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:53,460
measurements highly correlated to bulk

551
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:55,199
density because if your soil is super

552
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:56,340
fluffy right out of the bag it's going

553
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,900
to have it's going to show a higher

554
00:21:56,339 --> 00:22:00,119
organic matter

555
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:01,740
um but as we all know that bulk density

556
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:04,619
changes over time you know that's why

557
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:06,659
the that if you grow in a pot it looks

558
00:22:04,619 --> 00:22:08,399
like the soil sinks two to four inches

559
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:10,380
in the first round

560
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,900
um that bulk density is increasing so

561
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:15,240
organic matter is going to jump all over

562
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:18,179
the place based on bulk density and they

563
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:19,679
make an assumption with topsoil uh bulk

564
00:22:18,179 --> 00:22:22,259
density assumption that's usually pretty

565
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:26,460
accurate but in peat-based media it's

566
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:28,679
really not so usually a new peat-based

567
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:30,840
media is going to see you know show high

568
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:32,280
organic matter and high CEC right out of

569
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:33,720
the bag because it's fluffy and it's

570
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:35,759
full of nutrients but those numbers are

571
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:37,319
going to jump wildly so those are two

572
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:39,000
issues there's two more issues I can

573
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:40,019
kind of stop there

574
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,940
um actually I'm gonna I'm gonna just

575
00:22:40,019 --> 00:22:43,918
present one more which is that

576
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:46,200
this may be the biggest issue in my

577
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:48,780
opinion it's not the technical nature of

578
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:51,480
how they tested and blah blah blah it's

579
00:22:48,779 --> 00:22:54,178
more around what do you do with the

580
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:56,159
number because the purpose of testing if

581
00:22:54,179 --> 00:22:58,740
you're going to pay money to get a test

582
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:01,200
it's it's to determine some kind of

583
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:03,058
action you can take as a grower and so

584
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,340
if there's no management action that you

585
00:23:03,058 --> 00:23:08,579
can take with 40 organic matter or

586
00:23:05,339 --> 00:23:10,379
thirty percent then to me that's the

587
00:23:08,579 --> 00:23:12,658
biggest issue with any metric because

588
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:13,679
the purpose of these soil tests is to is

589
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:15,900
to take some kind of valuable

590
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:18,440
information and then go apply it via

591
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,440
action

592
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:24,240
so it's not tied at all to the CEC

593
00:23:22,259 --> 00:23:25,798
uh directly at least

594
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,019
they're totally the measurement is not

595
00:23:25,798 --> 00:23:30,359
okay totally separate that's good and

596
00:23:28,019 --> 00:23:33,119
yeah there's very little correlation uh

597
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:35,819
between those two numbers

598
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:37,739
so so the bottom line is ignore organic

599
00:23:35,819 --> 00:23:40,319
matter percentage if you're not testing

600
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:43,558
actual soil yes

601
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:45,899
now if you are testing actual soil how

602
00:23:43,558 --> 00:23:48,000
does the application of compost come

603
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:49,919
into play in affecting that organic

604
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,400
matter and giving us an accurate number

605
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:55,640
of what our percent really is because I

606
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:58,140
could imagine if I applied compost

607
00:23:55,640 --> 00:24:00,179
earlier in the season tilted in or top

608
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:02,220
dressed it I take by sample some of it

609
00:24:00,179 --> 00:24:05,460
ends up in the sample the sample

610
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:06,779
remember is only half a teaspoon of

611
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:08,840
actual material when we're talking about

612
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:12,500
the Malik 3

613
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:12,500
what's that going to do

614
00:24:12,558 --> 00:24:17,158
yes so and that's a great point because

615
00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:19,798
this the first problem I talked about

616
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:21,780
which is that we're testing pmos or

617
00:24:19,798 --> 00:24:23,720
immature compost and not

618
00:24:21,779 --> 00:24:27,720
organic matter in the traditional sense

619
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:30,480
that problem exists Outdoors too where

620
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:32,759
loads of composts have been applied so

621
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,500
you apply compost your organic matter

622
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:37,200
jumps from two percent to ten percent

623
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:39,359
you're super proud of yourself right but

624
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,980
that's just measuring the carbon from

625
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:44,939
your compost

626
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:47,159
which is good it's it means that your

627
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:50,519
your carbon inputs are high and that is

628
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:52,740
one of the many variables that leads to

629
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:56,879
the formation of stable organic matter

630
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:59,339
but it's not true organic matter by the

631
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,200
traditional definition so

632
00:24:59,339 --> 00:25:02,579
um that too is an issue and I worked at

633
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,500
a lot of

634
00:25:02,579 --> 00:25:06,240
um small organic vegetable Growers and

635
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,798
they use large amounts of compost and

636
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,679
their organic matter is very very high

637
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:14,579
on a soil test and

638
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:16,980
it's also you know when when compost

639
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:19,678
is applied it goes through a multi-year

640
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:22,259
decomposition process and so that number

641
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:24,419
is going to jump all over the place and

642
00:25:22,259 --> 00:25:26,339
so that the organic matter number gives

643
00:25:24,419 --> 00:25:28,320
you a little bit of information like you

644
00:25:26,339 --> 00:25:32,158
know this soil has been cultivated it

645
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:33,538
has high organic inputs but it's not

646
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:37,860
necessarily something that should be

647
00:25:33,538 --> 00:25:40,859
managed very closely even in a uh you

648
00:25:37,859 --> 00:25:42,000
know conventional broad acre cropping

649
00:25:40,859 --> 00:25:44,519
system

650
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,919
the organic matter number should be

651
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:48,839
looked at over I would say a five to ten

652
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:49,799
year Horizon and not a year-to-year

653
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:52,139
number

654
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:55,139
um because to your point there's organic

655
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:58,500
matter variation in soils as there is

656
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:59,820
and just everything in nature so

657
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:02,038
um you are going to see a little bit of

658
00:25:59,819 --> 00:26:04,200
fluctuation you shouldn't see large like

659
00:26:02,038 --> 00:26:08,038
full percentage points but you'll see

660
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:10,620
maybe tenths or even at a half of a

661
00:26:08,038 --> 00:26:12,839
percent fluctuation year to year so you

662
00:26:10,619 --> 00:26:14,819
really should be looking at added over

663
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:17,879
you know a five or ten year Horizon even

664
00:26:14,819 --> 00:26:19,500
in real topsoil so it's a very crude uh

665
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,820
measurement it's very important we all

666
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,500
know that organic matter is one of the

667
00:26:20,819 --> 00:26:24,599
most important things

668
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:26,759
um for organic Agriculture and for soil

669
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:28,558
health and for plant Health but it's a

670
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:30,000
it's a really tough thing to measure

671
00:26:28,558 --> 00:26:31,500
accurately

672
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:36,079
when

673
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:36,079
your soil test costs 50 bucks

674
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:40,020
yeah so we're really looking for Trends

675
00:26:38,278 --> 00:26:42,419
is it trending in the right direction is

676
00:26:40,019 --> 00:26:44,519
it moving up is it moving down correct

677
00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:46,740
that's I think I think that's the key

678
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:48,418
there okay but in a piece based media

679
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:51,120
just to just to be clear I wouldn't I

680
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:53,278
wouldn't even worry about the trend

681
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:55,918
yeah I've seen it jump all over the

682
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:58,259
place based on the sample so I don't

683
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:59,038
I I tend to ignore it too

684
00:26:58,259 --> 00:27:02,579
um

685
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:05,099
well uh you know sticking on the topic

686
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:07,558
of uh

687
00:27:05,099 --> 00:27:10,199
nutrients

688
00:27:07,558 --> 00:27:13,259
um we were going to talk about uh ratios

689
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:16,319
sort of versus levels because you get

690
00:27:13,259 --> 00:27:20,400
these ratios of what what your cations

691
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:21,960
are made up of how much of it is calcium

692
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,659
how much is magnesium how much is

693
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:25,740
potassium how important is that relative

694
00:27:24,659 --> 00:27:28,679
to

695
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:30,839
just the actual values in pounds per

696
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:32,400
acre of calcium magnesium potassium in

697
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:34,819
terms of sufficiency

698
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:37,259
yeah so there's there's sort of ratios

699
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:38,399
the racial conversation is fun because

700
00:27:37,259 --> 00:27:40,440
there's

701
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:43,380
people throw around a lot of ratios and

702
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:45,240
it depends on uh

703
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:47,760
the kind of tests you're taking so for

704
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:49,019
example I look at ratios on both a

705
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:51,538
tissue test

706
00:27:49,019 --> 00:27:53,298
and a soil test I look at ratios on the

707
00:27:51,538 --> 00:27:56,400
standard test like base cation

708
00:27:53,298 --> 00:27:58,918
percentages as well as on the pace test

709
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:01,798
so the ratios that I think matter the

710
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:05,340
most I I am um I've always really looked

711
00:28:01,798 --> 00:28:07,379
at calcium to potassium as a ratio

712
00:28:05,339 --> 00:28:09,899
um and I look at that primarily on the

713
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:12,360
tissue test I also look at iron and

714
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:15,360
manganese there's another very popular

715
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:16,798
one that I don't necessarily put a lot

716
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:17,759
of weight on which is nitrogen to

717
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:19,859
potassium

718
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:22,319
but I think what you're asking is

719
00:28:19,859 --> 00:28:24,359
probably around the standard test based

720
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:26,538
cation saturation ratio ratios is that

721
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:26,538
right

722
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:33,900
yeah and also the soluble cation ratio

723
00:28:29,339 --> 00:28:35,639
okay great great so yes yes the the soil

724
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,778
tests

725
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:39,240
um

726
00:28:36,778 --> 00:28:43,079
a very common sort of like Albrecht

727
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:46,679
based approach is to look at uh what I

728
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:51,538
call bcsr and it's the percentages of

729
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:53,460
cations extracted by the Malik 3 and

730
00:28:51,538 --> 00:28:54,839
all over the internet on all kinds of

731
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:56,759
different websites there's these

732
00:28:54,839 --> 00:29:01,199
percentages that generally fall between

733
00:28:56,759 --> 00:29:03,658
like 70 68 to 80 percent calcium uh 10

734
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:07,740
to 15 magnesium and three to seven

735
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:09,059
percent potassium I uh look at those but

736
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:11,220
I don't put a lot of weight on them

737
00:29:09,058 --> 00:29:12,899
because I prefer when managing a

738
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:14,759
peat-based media for cannabis production

739
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:16,740
I like looking at the saturated paste

740
00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:18,960
test and in that regard

741
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:20,460
um I do look at the percentages

742
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,740
um because what those percentages are

743
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:24,778
telling you is balance and so my general

744
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:27,000
approach to nutrient management is you

745
00:29:24,778 --> 00:29:30,538
have to achieve sufficient nutrient

746
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,819
levels and then you want to work toward

747
00:29:30,538 --> 00:29:35,278
balance between those nutrients so you

748
00:29:32,819 --> 00:29:37,019
can have a perfectly balanced

749
00:29:35,278 --> 00:29:39,839
um you're going to perfectly balanced

750
00:29:37,019 --> 00:29:42,240
cation nutrients let's say on the pace

751
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:43,740
test but it doesn't actually matter if

752
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,899
there's just not enough

753
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:47,519
food in that soil for those plants to

754
00:29:45,898 --> 00:29:49,819
eat it doesn't matter how balanced it is

755
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:54,119
and so the first thing I do is I have

756
00:29:49,819 --> 00:29:55,740
sufficiency levels of nutrients

757
00:29:54,119 --> 00:29:58,558
and then the next thing I do is I look

758
00:29:55,740 --> 00:30:02,399
at those percentages and I really like

759
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:05,278
um to see calcium generally at about 50

760
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:08,699
percent magnesium at about 20 and

761
00:30:05,278 --> 00:30:10,200
potassium at about 20. and

762
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:12,500
um for those who are doing the math that

763
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:14,759
leaves 10 to be allocated elsewhere

764
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:16,558
oftentimes that goes to sodium and

765
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:19,319
sometimes it goes to one of those other

766
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:21,298
nutrients just based on fluctuations or

767
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:23,819
you know how you like to run your your

768
00:30:21,298 --> 00:30:27,000
soil and

769
00:30:23,819 --> 00:30:28,379
what I've found is that that's that is

770
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,558
by far most important it's the most

771
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:34,140
correlated to the actual tissue tests in

772
00:30:31,558 --> 00:30:37,440
general it's correlated too to those

773
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:39,538
those standard tests bcsr ratios which

774
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:42,298
are usually you know that

775
00:30:39,538 --> 00:30:44,398
what sort of translates is usually about

776
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:45,538
seven percent potassium on the standard

777
00:30:44,398 --> 00:30:47,278
test

778
00:30:45,538 --> 00:30:50,640
um I do not like to go above 12

779
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:52,859
magnesium on the standard test and I

780
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:55,980
always want to be above 60 ideally well

781
00:30:52,859 --> 00:30:58,019
above 70 on calcium and usually if you

782
00:30:55,980 --> 00:31:01,200
can usually those will lead to the right

783
00:30:58,019 --> 00:31:02,579
soil solution balance but I don't try I

784
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,259
don't manage for that standard test

785
00:31:02,579 --> 00:31:06,119
percentage because it's sort of the tail

786
00:31:04,259 --> 00:31:07,919
that Wags the dog I go right to the PACE

787
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:10,019
test and I look at sufficiency and

788
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:14,278
balance on the pace test

789
00:31:10,019 --> 00:31:15,960
okay and I want to reiterate uh what you

790
00:31:14,278 --> 00:31:17,220
what you just said there I think that's

791
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:19,558
really important

792
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:22,140
um if the soluble salt level on your

793
00:31:19,558 --> 00:31:25,259
soil your EC is is low like let's say

794
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:27,419
you had 200 PPM on soluble salts that

795
00:31:25,259 --> 00:31:28,619
soil uh it doesn't matter if it's

796
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:31,640
perfectly balanced you're going to run

797
00:31:28,619 --> 00:31:35,158
out of nutrients relatively quickly

798
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:37,200
versus a soil with a much higher EC or

799
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:38,640
soluble salt level so

800
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,700
um but I think that's important because

801
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:43,020
I've seen some soil tests from from

802
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:45,240
folks where you know everything looks

803
00:31:43,019 --> 00:31:47,339
balanced but at the end of the day if

804
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:48,538
that if the amount of fertility is low

805
00:31:47,339 --> 00:31:49,619
it doesn't it doesn't really matter

806
00:31:48,538 --> 00:31:50,819
you're going to run out and you have to

807
00:31:49,619 --> 00:31:53,939
add nutrients and those aren't going to

808
00:31:50,819 --> 00:31:55,619
necessarily be balanced anyway so

809
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:57,840
I think that's a really important point

810
00:31:55,619 --> 00:32:01,259
you brought up um

811
00:31:57,839 --> 00:32:02,158
also uh as you're as you're looking at

812
00:32:01,259 --> 00:32:04,919
this

813
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:06,778
um when we talk about hitting uh

814
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:07,740
sufficiency first

815
00:32:06,778 --> 00:32:09,720
um

816
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:11,460
just switching topics here one of the

817
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:14,940
things we talked about was

818
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:17,278
um sort of luxury nutrients where do you

819
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:19,679
get concerned about

820
00:32:17,278 --> 00:32:22,679
um sort of excesses and toxicities when

821
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:25,919
we talk about our major uh cations and

822
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:27,179
ions you know versus say things that you

823
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:28,620
know you're not too worried if you see

824
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:31,559
high levels of

825
00:32:28,619 --> 00:32:33,599
sulfur for example yeah great

826
00:32:31,558 --> 00:32:36,359
okay so

827
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:37,199
um every nutrient by the way is is sort

828
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:39,479
of

829
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:41,278
a separate topic and so they're all very

830
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:43,440
different and how I look at each one how

831
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:47,038
I look at each one on the soil test is

832
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:49,080
they're all different yeah it's so

833
00:32:47,038 --> 00:32:51,720
But to answer your question

834
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:53,639
um the worst cation to have

835
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:55,860
in excess is sodium it's not an

836
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:59,460
essential plant nutrient and it's simply

837
00:32:55,859 --> 00:33:02,099
it it puts undue pressure on

838
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:03,319
the electrical conductivity in the

839
00:33:02,099 --> 00:33:06,599
osmotic

840
00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:08,939
pressure that it exerts on on Roots so

841
00:33:06,599 --> 00:33:10,918
if there's in a perfect world you'd have

842
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:12,538
zero PPM of sodium there's just no

843
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:15,419
purpose

844
00:33:12,538 --> 00:33:17,158
um but that's impossible in organic soil

845
00:33:15,419 --> 00:33:18,538
based systems so sodium is low as

846
00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:20,340
possible that's the worst thing to have

847
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:21,960
in excess luckily it's very mobile so

848
00:33:20,339 --> 00:33:25,459
you can leech it out

849
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:27,720
um or flush it out of your soil

850
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:30,120
if it's not in your water I want to

851
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:31,860
highlight that because some people have

852
00:33:30,119 --> 00:33:33,359
sodium in their water or they're using

853
00:33:31,859 --> 00:33:35,639
conditioners to their water that's

854
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:37,798
adding sodium so Flushing High sodium

855
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:40,799
soles with sodium water doesn't work

856
00:33:37,798 --> 00:33:42,418
yeah yeah it's one of them yeah for sure

857
00:33:40,798 --> 00:33:43,980
I mean the one thing about high sodium

858
00:33:42,419 --> 00:33:46,860
water how you can manage it a

859
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:48,480
traditional method is you accept it this

860
00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:51,959
is the water we've got

861
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,798
elevated in sodium we can't filter it or

862
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,960
whatever

863
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:56,579
so you just water water and then you

864
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,440
flush because what happens is the water

865
00:33:56,579 --> 00:34:00,298
evaporates leaves the sodium behind and

866
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:02,278
so the levels start to accumulate and

867
00:34:00,298 --> 00:34:05,099
you so you can theoretically flush that

868
00:34:02,278 --> 00:34:06,720
out even with your high sodium water but

869
00:34:05,099 --> 00:34:08,039
it's it's never going to get it low it's

870
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,740
just going to revert back to whatever

871
00:34:08,039 --> 00:34:12,659
your water level is but yeah to your

872
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:15,358
point you can never get it you can never

873
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:17,940
manage to zero if it's in your water

874
00:34:15,358 --> 00:34:19,559
um so the next one though I want to

875
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:23,220
bring up which is a tricky one an

876
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:25,139
organic uh peat-based media is magnesium

877
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:28,199
and magnesiums

878
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:31,500
magnesium is is uh

879
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:34,739
often High often excessive and it's

880
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:36,539
antagonistic and it's not needed in

881
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:39,358
nearly the quantity that calcium and

882
00:34:36,539 --> 00:34:41,460
potassium are in the plant tissue and it

883
00:34:39,358 --> 00:34:43,918
gets in the way and it can can really

884
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:45,179
create sort of this gentle antagonism

885
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:46,679
that you're not initially going to see

886
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:48,119
visually but it's slowing down your

887
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:48,898
plants and reducing yield and crop

888
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:50,760
quality

889
00:34:48,898 --> 00:34:53,898
so

890
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:56,520
um magnesium is a tough one to manage

891
00:34:53,898 --> 00:34:58,019
my Approach is

892
00:34:56,519 --> 00:34:59,880
I

893
00:34:58,019 --> 00:35:02,099
like to set a minimum sufficient level

894
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:04,200
for magnesium and then I have a an

895
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:06,780
optimization algorithm that changes the

896
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:08,399
level of calcium and potassium if

897
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:10,380
magnesium is high to just try to

898
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:13,019
maintain balance because those are

899
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:14,880
always competing for one another and so

900
00:35:13,019 --> 00:35:16,440
I'm looking at both the pace tests the

901
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,838
percentage on the pace test and the

902
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:20,880
percentage on the on the Malik 3. and

903
00:35:18,838 --> 00:35:23,000
like I said I I never apply any

904
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:25,380
magnesium If the percentage is above 12

905
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,260
because what tends to happen is when you

906
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:29,880
apply gypsum it opens up and and

907
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:31,500
magnesium flows into solution so

908
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:34,320
magnesium is one of the more complicated

909
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:35,820
things to look at and manage

910
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,440
um and it's not as easy when you have

911
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:38,820
excess magnesium I still think you

912
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,440
should Leach your soil you'll see those

913
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:42,539
levels drop especially the soluble

914
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:45,420
levels but you're never actually going

915
00:35:42,539 --> 00:35:47,400
to be able to pull it all out the key is

916
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:51,300
you just try to minimize the inputs with

917
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:52,980
high magnesium I never I sometimes very

918
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:55,079
rarely I'll recommend a little dolomitic

919
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:57,599
lime in a real topsoil but never in a

920
00:35:55,079 --> 00:36:00,060
peat-based media and

921
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:01,800
um so really the only source the only

922
00:36:00,059 --> 00:36:04,619
two sources of magnesium I'm ever

923
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:08,280
recommending might be a little bit of

924
00:36:04,619 --> 00:36:10,500
um like uh potassium magnesium sulfate

925
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:12,019
it's an organic mineral

926
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:14,039
um

927
00:36:12,019 --> 00:36:15,780
as the mineral name but there's

928
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:17,400
different trade names like kmag or

929
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:18,240
sulpomag

930
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,920
um yeah

931
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:22,858
and then

932
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,539
otherwise I think Epsom salt as a foliar

933
00:36:22,858 --> 00:36:26,219
is a great way to just give small

934
00:36:24,539 --> 00:36:27,599
amounts of magnesium to your plant as

935
00:36:26,219 --> 00:36:30,358
needed

936
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:32,220
um based on visual symptoms or tissue

937
00:36:30,358 --> 00:36:34,679
tests and you're never applying it to

938
00:36:32,219 --> 00:36:36,118
the soil to push those levels up so I

939
00:36:34,679 --> 00:36:38,879
like running that a little bit low and

940
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:40,500
maintaining plenty of sufficiency and

941
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:43,579
and more of a weighted balance toward

942
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:43,579
calcium and potassium

943
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:48,838
yeah I mean I agree with everything you

944
00:36:46,019 --> 00:36:50,880
said I always run magnesium low in our

945
00:36:48,838 --> 00:36:54,000
soils because I know it's so easy to add

946
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:56,640
via episode and affordable exactly and

947
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,280
all will actually you know on occasion

948
00:36:56,639 --> 00:37:02,219
do Epsom salt drenches just like a

949
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:04,019
tablespoon per gallon of water when we

950
00:37:02,219 --> 00:37:07,259
see that magnesium level

951
00:37:04,019 --> 00:37:09,838
drop I like the foliar idea too

952
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:11,160
um but uh yeah no that's that's really

953
00:37:09,838 --> 00:37:12,960
interesting I wasn't aware of something

954
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:15,598
being something you could really flush

955
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:18,539
very effectively and I assume if you did

956
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:20,099
you're also going to have to add a lot

957
00:37:18,539 --> 00:37:21,900
of fertility back in because you

958
00:37:20,099 --> 00:37:23,400
probably you've absolutely flushed the

959
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:25,740
more mobile nutrients out to like

960
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:28,260
phosphate nitrogen potassium things like

961
00:37:25,739 --> 00:37:29,639
that sodium yeah and every everything on

962
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:31,980
the pace test is going to be mobile

963
00:37:29,639 --> 00:37:34,799
because it's just it's floating it's not

964
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:36,719
real so it's a good point when you when

965
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,160
you leech heavily because you have an

966
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:40,078
excess of something everything is going

967
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:42,420
to go down it's sort of like a hard

968
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:45,539
refresh so

969
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:48,599
um for example like

970
00:37:45,539 --> 00:37:51,599
yeah when I when I see something sodium

971
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:54,240
maybe over 45 parts per million on the

972
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:56,160
pace test the soil doctor tool will

973
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:57,598
recommend or my you know my

974
00:37:56,159 --> 00:37:58,858
recommendations will recommend leeching

975
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:00,780
your soil and that'll flush everything

976
00:37:58,858 --> 00:38:02,519
and then you're going to reset re-test

977
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:03,540
and reamend

978
00:38:02,519 --> 00:38:06,420
um

979
00:38:03,539 --> 00:38:08,279
and that over the long term is a far

980
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:10,800
better approach to plant Health than

981
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:13,260
just continuing to push now sodium some

982
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:16,200
strains and in some operations sodium is

983
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:19,980
okay it's not like it's not toxic

984
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:21,480
it's just going to create excess osmotic

985
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:22,800
stress on the plant so you're getting a

986
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,719
more you're getting more efficient

987
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:27,119
metabolism

988
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:29,219
um when it's lower

989
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:31,800
the plants having to work harder in that

990
00:38:29,219 --> 00:38:34,500
soil to access nutrients essentially is

991
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:36,119
what you're saying correct and there is

992
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,679
um in certain crop species like a

993
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:39,240
substitution effect that happens where

994
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:41,399
it starts using sodium instead of

995
00:38:39,239 --> 00:38:43,319
potassium Which is less efficient

996
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,639
metabolically

997
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:46,440
I wasn't aware of that that's

998
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:48,179
interesting

999
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:50,460
um

1000
00:38:48,179 --> 00:38:52,019
well then let's let's uh let's move on

1001
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:54,179
to a couple of the other touch on some

1002
00:38:52,019 --> 00:38:57,320
of the other minerals here you've talked

1003
00:38:54,179 --> 00:38:59,399
about magnesium and sodium so far

1004
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:02,280
what's uh

1005
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:03,539
what's another one that uh you've talked

1006
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:05,099
about two relatively you know

1007
00:39:03,539 --> 00:39:06,719
antagonistic ones that we want to

1008
00:39:05,099 --> 00:39:08,519
monitor

1009
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:11,519
um

1010
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:13,380
what's another one you wanted well and

1011
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:15,239
the other thing just to mention on these

1012
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:16,858
cations is a lot of them are influenced

1013
00:39:15,239 --> 00:39:19,259
by more than the levels and the balance

1014
00:39:16,858 --> 00:39:22,500
they're influenced by evapotranspiration

1015
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:26,820
and irrigation technique and root size

1016
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:30,000
and so I can't stress enough that it's

1017
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:33,240
really really really valuable to to

1018
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,679
use tissue testing to validate

1019
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:36,118
because oftentimes you can have enough

1020
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:37,379
calcium but you don't see enough in the

1021
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:40,559
plant and it's a different issue you

1022
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:42,960
need to address entirely like watering

1023
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:44,159
um or maybe your relative humidity or

1024
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:47,699
your VPD

1025
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:49,379
so tissue testing is really a good way

1026
00:39:47,699 --> 00:39:51,779
to to make sure that there aren't other

1027
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:53,820
issues with nutrient uptake

1028
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:57,300
um but to talk about other nutrients I

1029
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:58,500
mean I nitrogen is a fascinating one

1030
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:01,440
um

1031
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:04,338
in the sense that I do think

1032
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:07,139
um of all the nutrients I I generally

1033
00:40:04,338 --> 00:40:08,578
recommend maintaining fairly stable

1034
00:40:07,139 --> 00:40:10,379
concentrations that's the goal in

1035
00:40:08,579 --> 00:40:11,640
organic production

1036
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:14,160
um you know there's a lot of things

1037
00:40:11,639 --> 00:40:16,440
happening the microbes are breaking down

1038
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:18,598
amendments and releasing nutrients the

1039
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:19,980
plants are uptaking them nutrients are

1040
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:21,539
being sort of leached to the bottom of

1041
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:24,000
your beds

1042
00:40:21,539 --> 00:40:25,440
um when you water so there's a bunch of

1043
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,539
different things happening but the goal

1044
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,639
should be to really try to maintain

1045
00:40:27,539 --> 00:40:31,739
consistent levels sufficient levels

1046
00:40:29,639 --> 00:40:33,118
throughout the entire round of most

1047
00:40:31,739 --> 00:40:35,159
nutrients but nitrogen is a little

1048
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:36,300
different in the sense that

1049
00:40:35,159 --> 00:40:38,578
um

1050
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:40,920
it's going to be taken up quickly and in

1051
00:40:38,579 --> 00:40:42,900
high quantities by the plant and

1052
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:45,119
generally speaking

1053
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:47,700
I like to have

1054
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:51,000
you know high but not excessive levels

1055
00:40:47,699 --> 00:40:53,519
through veg and I like nitrogen levels

1056
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,320
to draw down through veg

1057
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:57,119
um to sort of

1058
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:59,039
to change the carbon and nitrogen

1059
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:00,838
balance in the plant with the theory

1060
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:03,420
that you're sort of optimizing quality

1061
00:41:00,838 --> 00:41:05,039
or terpene expression with lower

1062
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:07,260
nitrogen levels it doesn't doesn't mean

1063
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:09,420
zero nitrogen at all because you still

1064
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:11,220
need nitrogen for plant metabolism and

1065
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:13,139
protein synthesis and flower development

1066
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:14,879
but a lot of that nitrogen is actually

1067
00:41:13,139 --> 00:41:17,279
being moved from

1068
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,480
from the plant's existing tissue so

1069
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,700
there's already a lot of nitrogen that's

1070
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:23,159
taken up through the plant cycle that

1071
00:41:20,699 --> 00:41:26,279
the plant is then using in flour and so

1072
00:41:23,159 --> 00:41:27,598
nitrogen uptake really goes down and uh

1073
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:29,820
you can you can

1074
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:32,039
create some issues by running nitrogen

1075
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:33,660
too hard too late in flour and so that

1076
00:41:32,039 --> 00:41:34,980
is that that one is interesting to me

1077
00:41:33,659 --> 00:41:36,899
because

1078
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:40,199
um I do think

1079
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:43,200
that should be measured and it should be

1080
00:41:40,199 --> 00:41:44,759
managed a little bit differently by not

1081
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:48,799
necessarily maintaining this the same

1082
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:48,800
concentration through the entire cycle

1083
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:54,420
yeah we do see that you know when you

1084
00:41:51,539 --> 00:41:56,460
have high nitrogen you'll see uh you'll

1085
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:58,920
have very like larfy

1086
00:41:56,460 --> 00:42:00,838
plants that just won't yield and they'll

1087
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:01,680
be super dark green

1088
00:42:00,838 --> 00:42:05,039
um

1089
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:07,078
we we do see it uh but rarely because

1090
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:09,059
most of the time we can control nitrogen

1091
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:10,500
through flushing so if you do have too

1092
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:11,578
much nitrogen it's pretty easy to lower

1093
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:13,858
it

1094
00:42:11,579 --> 00:42:16,920
um but one question I did have for you

1095
00:42:13,858 --> 00:42:19,078
uh that we didn't we didn't answer was

1096
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:21,539
for people who do want to flush how much

1097
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:22,200
water do you recommend by volume

1098
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:25,019
um

1099
00:42:22,199 --> 00:42:26,819
to run yeah an average soil

1100
00:42:25,019 --> 00:42:28,559
well so one thing one thing about

1101
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:29,880
flushing is it's I don't think it's

1102
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:31,858
great to do in the middle of a round

1103
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,900
sometimes you have to if you have a

1104
00:42:31,858 --> 00:42:34,559
really good draining soil

1105
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:37,559
um

1106
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:40,799
then go for it but I also think that if

1107
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:43,679
you it can create more harm than good if

1108
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:46,619
you if your soil doesn't necessarily

1109
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:50,578
have high drainage capacity I like to

1110
00:42:46,619 --> 00:42:51,480
wait until after you harvest to leech

1111
00:42:50,579 --> 00:42:54,599
um

1112
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:56,338
and there's no magic way to do it I mean

1113
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:58,740
one way to do it is you just water your

1114
00:42:56,338 --> 00:43:01,799
beds your pots and you just measure the

1115
00:42:58,739 --> 00:43:05,578
EC of the runoff and I generally say

1116
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:07,519
just wherever your aec is keep watering

1117
00:43:05,579 --> 00:43:10,019
until it's 50 of where you started

1118
00:43:07,519 --> 00:43:13,858
that's one method the other method would

1119
00:43:10,019 --> 00:43:16,199
be to I just say like water until like

1120
00:43:13,858 --> 00:43:18,059
six inches or 12 inches run on the

1121
00:43:16,199 --> 00:43:20,039
bottom of the pots or the beds it really

1122
00:43:18,059 --> 00:43:23,039
depends on the severity of what you're

1123
00:43:20,039 --> 00:43:24,900
dealing with so if you if you are you

1124
00:43:23,039 --> 00:43:27,059
know you failed for heavy metals or if

1125
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:29,519
you just have if you have 150 PPM of

1126
00:43:27,059 --> 00:43:32,099
sodium on the pace test and you just

1127
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:33,420
want a and like I said a hard refresh

1128
00:43:32,099 --> 00:43:34,079
then

1129
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:36,720
um

1130
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:38,818
just just really go for it until you get

1131
00:43:36,719 --> 00:43:40,259
a foot of runoff or something

1132
00:43:38,818 --> 00:43:41,818
um so it really kind of depends on the

1133
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:43,800
severity there's no magic number that

1134
00:43:41,818 --> 00:43:47,119
necessarily it's really really depends

1135
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:49,800
on on what you're trying to do

1136
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:51,660
yeah I guess for me the situations where

1137
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:53,760
I may want to leech mid-round is where I

1138
00:43:51,659 --> 00:43:57,659
get a soil test back from a commercial

1139
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:59,700
grower who's you know mid flower plants

1140
00:43:57,659 --> 00:44:01,399
aren't developing I see on this test

1141
00:43:59,699 --> 00:44:06,000
they've got

1142
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:06,660
300 PPM of nitrates in there

1143
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,539
um

1144
00:44:06,659 --> 00:44:11,338
I I feel like

1145
00:44:09,539 --> 00:44:13,079
and then I'm gonna have a conversation

1146
00:44:11,338 --> 00:44:14,460
like Hey we're gonna get a yield but

1147
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:16,619
it's not going to be the yield that you

1148
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:18,800
want do we stress the plant by over

1149
00:44:16,619 --> 00:44:21,420
watering it where it's going to you know

1150
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:23,760
you're you're potentially impacting the

1151
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:25,619
biology of the soil you're killing some

1152
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:27,780
some root hairs

1153
00:44:25,619 --> 00:44:29,640
um you're causing plant stress but

1154
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:31,800
you're going to lower that nitrate level

1155
00:44:29,639 --> 00:44:34,318
what's better I guess is the scenario

1156
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:37,260
there and what would your thought be

1157
00:44:34,318 --> 00:44:40,380
with a hypothetical like that you know

1158
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:42,540
I think if you

1159
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:44,579
it just totally depends on the

1160
00:44:42,539 --> 00:44:46,980
composition of the media

1161
00:44:44,579 --> 00:44:48,000
if it's like a horizonal system or

1162
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:50,280
something that just I don't know

1163
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,960
something that's not well that's not

1164
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:52,920
true if it was a horizontal system I

1165
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:54,240
would still

1166
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:58,619
what I would probably recommend

1167
00:44:54,239 --> 00:45:01,679
mid-round is to do a slower leaching

1168
00:44:58,619 --> 00:45:05,460
event so to do like multiple

1169
00:45:01,679 --> 00:45:07,379
pulses that are sort of pushing the

1170
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:09,119
water like this but still pulling air

1171
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:11,400
into the profile between each leaching

1172
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:14,400
event so instead of just one like you

1173
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:17,400
know four hour irrigation set I might

1174
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:18,480
just say water to run off six times in a

1175
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:19,920
row

1176
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:23,159
um that's one idea

1177
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:26,280
I don't know one day yeah

1178
00:45:23,159 --> 00:45:29,279
okay are are many people doing a

1179
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:31,200
horizonal system honestly I don't we

1180
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:33,780
don't work with anyone that grows like

1181
00:45:31,199 --> 00:45:36,118
that I know it's somewhat popular online

1182
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:38,339
but I feel like the challenges with

1183
00:45:36,119 --> 00:45:39,780
watering like you mentioned and and

1184
00:45:38,338 --> 00:45:43,799
fertility

1185
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:45,900
sort of move me away from it

1186
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:48,000
I know that several people who have

1187
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:50,280
received soil recommendations for me are

1188
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,619
using it but I'm not

1189
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:54,300
um

1190
00:45:51,619 --> 00:45:56,880
actively engaged having conversations

1191
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:58,079
with them on a weekly basis but yeah I

1192
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,338
think I mean I've heard a lot of people

1193
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:01,140
doing it

1194
00:45:59,338 --> 00:46:04,980
um I also just think like

1195
00:46:01,139 --> 00:46:06,719
I've mixed media doing tests that is

1196
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:08,519
extremely porous and I've mixed media

1197
00:46:06,719 --> 00:46:11,818
where I incorporate five or ten percent

1198
00:46:08,519 --> 00:46:14,219
of my top soil from my farm and change

1199
00:46:11,818 --> 00:46:15,719
the drainage dramatically so yeah I mean

1200
00:46:14,219 --> 00:46:18,118
I think you can reach I just get a

1201
00:46:15,719 --> 00:46:20,279
little bit nervous about it because

1202
00:46:18,119 --> 00:46:22,858
um everyone has a different situation

1203
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:25,019
but I think in pots when you have a true

1204
00:46:22,858 --> 00:46:27,000
peat-based media and pots I think

1205
00:46:25,019 --> 00:46:28,559
drainage is fine you just water until

1206
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,880
you get heavy runoff and there's no

1207
00:46:28,559 --> 00:46:31,078
issue whatsoever but I think it's

1208
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:32,280
something to be aware of I just want to

1209
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:34,740
mention it

1210
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:36,060
no that's a good point I think uh just

1211
00:46:34,739 --> 00:46:37,799
for listeners like if you're if we're

1212
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:39,119
talking about Pro mix that's a very

1213
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:41,039
different conversation than talking

1214
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:43,318
about something that's

1215
00:46:41,039 --> 00:46:45,480
oh I don't know like you said has actual

1216
00:46:43,318 --> 00:46:46,980
topsoil in it and is some sort of

1217
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:48,240
horizonal system that's not going to

1218
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:50,400
drain the same that you're going to have

1219
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:52,979
some perched water challenges and other

1220
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:54,780
things with water movement through the

1221
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:57,119
media potentially

1222
00:46:54,780 --> 00:47:00,540
yeah

1223
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:02,099
okay well enough on that let's move on

1224
00:47:00,539 --> 00:47:03,659
um was there anything else I know we

1225
00:47:02,099 --> 00:47:04,980
could probably do a whole podcast just

1226
00:47:03,659 --> 00:47:06,779
on nitrogen but was there anything else

1227
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:09,358
you wanted to touch on besides the fact

1228
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:12,660
that uh nitrogen really needs to be

1229
00:47:09,358 --> 00:47:15,380
managed and you can absolutely have

1230
00:47:12,659 --> 00:47:15,379
too much

1231
00:47:16,199 --> 00:47:20,219
um wow there's a million things we talk

1232
00:47:18,059 --> 00:47:22,858
about uh

1233
00:47:20,219 --> 00:47:26,039
amino acids are interesting

1234
00:47:22,858 --> 00:47:28,159
um to me from a nitrogen standpoint

1235
00:47:26,039 --> 00:47:28,159
um

1236
00:47:28,858 --> 00:47:32,880
and I just think that that the only

1237
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:34,920
other thought I wanted to throw out

1238
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:38,400
there for folks is when you're when

1239
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:40,740
you're using organic nitrogen amendments

1240
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:43,680
all of them including amino acids have

1241
00:47:40,739 --> 00:47:46,439
to go through the nitrogen cycle

1242
00:47:43,679 --> 00:47:48,118
um I I think maybe even on the last

1243
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:49,619
podcast here for the last several years

1244
00:47:48,119 --> 00:47:52,800
I generally

1245
00:47:49,619 --> 00:47:54,900
thought and I had been told

1246
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:57,060
um from

1247
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:59,880
other experienced agronomists and

1248
00:47:57,059 --> 00:48:02,880
Consultants that that amino acid uptake

1249
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:04,858
is much more metabolically efficient

1250
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:08,640
and it saves the plant an enormous

1251
00:48:04,858 --> 00:48:11,219
amount of energy because the plant

1252
00:48:08,639 --> 00:48:13,920
doesn't have to convert nitrate back

1253
00:48:11,219 --> 00:48:16,078
into amino acids to create plant tissue

1254
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:18,480
which is uses the amino acids directly

1255
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:22,260
and my thinking on that has actually

1256
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:25,079
evolved quite a bit and I don't actually

1257
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:28,980
think that plants are uptaking

1258
00:48:25,079 --> 00:48:30,780
amino acids in significant quantities at

1259
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:33,599
all because

1260
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:36,420
um the well I've reviewed a lot of of

1261
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:37,380
the research on amino acid uptake and I

1262
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:39,480
actually think most of it's getting

1263
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:41,039
converted into ammonium and then nitrate

1264
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:43,019
plant takes it up and then it gets

1265
00:48:41,039 --> 00:48:44,699
converted back into amino acids so it is

1266
00:48:43,019 --> 00:48:46,380
true that theoretically you get a huge

1267
00:48:44,699 --> 00:48:49,439
metabolic savings if the plant uptakes

1268
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:51,539
amino acids but my belief is that the

1269
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:53,159
microbes feed first in the soil and so

1270
00:48:51,539 --> 00:48:56,219
they're going to take that those amino

1271
00:48:53,159 --> 00:48:58,379
acids and convert it into nitrate the

1272
00:48:56,219 --> 00:49:00,959
reason I like amino acids is because of

1273
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:02,460
the particle size either they're in

1274
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:04,380
liquid form or they're in a powdered

1275
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:06,539
form that you can feed and they're

1276
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:08,039
they're very quickly available and so it

1277
00:49:06,539 --> 00:49:09,838
really gives you more control as a

1278
00:49:08,039 --> 00:49:11,159
grower when it comes to nitrogen

1279
00:49:09,838 --> 00:49:13,858
management

1280
00:49:11,159 --> 00:49:15,960
um and I also want to mention that all

1281
00:49:13,858 --> 00:49:18,059
organic amendments are Amino based

1282
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:20,220
they're all protein based so they're

1283
00:49:18,059 --> 00:49:21,719
enzymatically broken down into amino

1284
00:49:20,219 --> 00:49:24,480
acids

1285
00:49:21,719 --> 00:49:26,759
um and so even when you apply alfalfa

1286
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:28,858
meal that is a sort of amino based

1287
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:30,540
source of fertility it's just a much

1288
00:49:28,858 --> 00:49:33,179
larger particle size that takes longer

1289
00:49:30,539 --> 00:49:35,699
to break down in the soil microbially so

1290
00:49:33,179 --> 00:49:37,980
that's sort of an interesting thing to

1291
00:49:35,699 --> 00:49:41,279
me I I think more about particle size

1292
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:44,460
than I do about uh the source of the

1293
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:47,040
nitrogen whether the label says amino

1294
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:48,539
acids or whether the label says soybean

1295
00:49:47,039 --> 00:49:50,219
meal for example

1296
00:49:48,539 --> 00:49:52,500
um and so my my thinking's evolved on

1297
00:49:50,219 --> 00:49:53,939
that a bit

1298
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:56,400
I don't know where I was going with that

1299
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:58,019
other than oh the nitrogen cycle so

1300
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:00,180
the other thing I think Growers need to

1301
00:49:58,019 --> 00:50:03,059
think about is when you apply a huge

1302
00:50:00,179 --> 00:50:05,399
amount of amendments

1303
00:50:03,059 --> 00:50:07,078
um organic amendments that microbial

1304
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:11,039
action that breaks those amendments down

1305
00:50:07,079 --> 00:50:12,300
is consuming a lot of oxygen so the

1306
00:50:11,039 --> 00:50:14,400
reason that

1307
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:16,500
it's usually pretty intuitive and pretty

1308
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:19,740
uh well understood that you should let

1309
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:22,440
your soil cook before planting

1310
00:50:19,739 --> 00:50:24,659
um is because all those amendments are

1311
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:26,159
turning into ammonium

1312
00:50:24,659 --> 00:50:28,078
before they turn into nitrate and

1313
00:50:26,159 --> 00:50:29,699
ammonium is really not a preferred plant

1314
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:32,220
available source of nitrogen so that's

1315
00:50:29,699 --> 00:50:33,899
the one thing but in that process

1316
00:50:32,219 --> 00:50:36,059
those microbes are consuming a

1317
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:37,318
tremendous amount of oxygen and that's a

1318
00:50:36,059 --> 00:50:39,059
huge challenge for Growers because

1319
00:50:37,318 --> 00:50:40,739
people are trying to flip you know into

1320
00:50:39,059 --> 00:50:42,179
the next round as quickly as possible

1321
00:50:40,739 --> 00:50:44,219
and sometimes you don't have three weeks

1322
00:50:42,179 --> 00:50:46,919
to let your soil cooker let those those

1323
00:50:44,219 --> 00:50:49,078
amendments break down and so

1324
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:50,760
honestly if you can never let your soil

1325
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:52,680
get so depleted that you're applying

1326
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:54,720
enormous amounts of those organic

1327
00:50:52,679 --> 00:50:56,338
amendments that's the best solution

1328
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:58,618
um you're just kind of constantly either

1329
00:50:56,338 --> 00:51:00,719
top dressing or feeding

1330
00:50:58,619 --> 00:51:03,059
um nitrogen as the plants need it and

1331
00:51:00,719 --> 00:51:05,519
you never let your your nitrate get to 2

1332
00:51:03,059 --> 00:51:07,619
PPM and have to apply like massive

1333
00:51:05,519 --> 00:51:09,179
amounts of any of these amendments

1334
00:51:07,619 --> 00:51:10,500
because once you plant into it those

1335
00:51:09,179 --> 00:51:14,719
young plants are not going to like the

1336
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:14,719
high ammonium low oxygen environment

1337
00:51:15,179 --> 00:51:18,419
that's interesting because the way I've

1338
00:51:16,858 --> 00:51:20,578
always described it and correct me if

1339
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:23,099
I'm wrong on this but my understanding

1340
00:51:20,579 --> 00:51:25,740
is as we add a lot of

1341
00:51:23,099 --> 00:51:27,119
uh nutrients you know in this case we're

1342
00:51:25,739 --> 00:51:30,838
talking about nitrogen

1343
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:33,838
um one I've noticed that different

1344
00:51:30,838 --> 00:51:35,940
uh nitrogen sources will create

1345
00:51:33,838 --> 00:51:38,940
different microbial communities and

1346
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:41,159
different sort of bacterial blooms

1347
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:42,780
um certain things are seem to be more

1348
00:51:41,159 --> 00:51:45,299
balanced from a microbial perspective

1349
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:47,460
like alfalfa meal versus some of these

1350
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:49,140
other amendments but I've always

1351
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:51,599
described it as

1352
00:51:49,139 --> 00:51:54,000
um sort of like the you add all these

1353
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:57,420
nutrients you've created this Feast for

1354
00:51:54,000 --> 00:52:00,000
all the bacteria archaea fungi protozoa

1355
00:51:57,420 --> 00:52:01,619
in in the soil it's a the bacteria is

1356
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,019
sort of an exothermic reaction they're

1357
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:05,880
generating heat as they reproduce and

1358
00:52:04,019 --> 00:52:08,280
that's creating this you know it's

1359
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:12,059
essentially thermally composting your

1360
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:13,559
soil and plant roots also don't like a

1361
00:52:12,059 --> 00:52:15,660
lot of that temperature and they may not

1362
00:52:13,559 --> 00:52:17,339
be able to access the nutrients as

1363
00:52:15,659 --> 00:52:19,199
efficiently like you said the microbes

1364
00:52:17,338 --> 00:52:22,858
feed first so even if they're sufficient

1365
00:52:19,199 --> 00:52:26,338
fertility in that soil if the bacteria

1366
00:52:22,858 --> 00:52:28,440
is actively like reproducing at high

1367
00:52:26,338 --> 00:52:30,239
levels then those nutrients aren't going

1368
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:31,559
to be available to the plant and you

1369
00:52:30,239 --> 00:52:33,118
could see

1370
00:52:31,559 --> 00:52:35,280
um deficiencies expressed in the plant

1371
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:37,858
even though well probably due to like

1372
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:41,280
you said excess ammonium root hair death

1373
00:52:37,858 --> 00:52:43,199
from soil temperatures a lack of oxygen

1374
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:47,220
so a variety of factors potentially

1375
00:52:43,199 --> 00:52:48,960
affecting it so what we try to do is

1376
00:52:47,219 --> 00:52:51,598
like you said you you have high

1377
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:53,338
fertility in the soil you go to reament

1378
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:55,680
and by having a larger volume of soil

1379
00:52:53,338 --> 00:52:57,480
like in a bed when you go to reament you

1380
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:59,460
don't have to add as much nutrients as

1381
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:01,858
you would to that same volume of soil if

1382
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:03,838
it was grown in like a seven gallon pot

1383
00:53:01,858 --> 00:53:04,980
so we don't have to it's not going to

1384
00:53:03,838 --> 00:53:07,500
heat up it's not going to go through

1385
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:11,699
quite those extremes and it doesn't need

1386
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:15,260
to sit as long too in in my experience

1387
00:53:11,699 --> 00:53:15,259
yeah yeah definitely

1388
00:53:16,019 --> 00:53:21,420
um Okay cool so uh just to keep things

1389
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:22,260
moving along here

1390
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:23,880
um

1391
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:25,440
what are some of the ones that you you

1392
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:27,720
aren't concerned about you know I had

1393
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:29,460
mentioned sulfur as sort of a luxury

1394
00:53:27,719 --> 00:53:30,539
nutrient

1395
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:32,220
um what are some other ones that you're

1396
00:53:30,539 --> 00:53:34,800
like okay there may be a little too much

1397
00:53:32,219 --> 00:53:36,598
here but I'm not too concerned yeah well

1398
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,740
if I had a magic wand I would reduce

1399
00:53:36,599 --> 00:53:39,838
sulfur

1400
00:53:37,739 --> 00:53:42,719
um just because again it's okay putting

1401
00:53:39,838 --> 00:53:44,338
on new pressure on EC but there's no but

1402
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:47,098
besides that I have no issues with high

1403
00:53:44,338 --> 00:53:48,539
sulfur and I actually just think it's

1404
00:53:47,099 --> 00:53:50,880
um okay

1405
00:53:48,539 --> 00:53:53,579
if you if you're if you in order to get

1406
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:55,740
high calcium and high potassium you just

1407
00:53:53,579 --> 00:53:57,599
sort of have to use you're going to see

1408
00:53:55,739 --> 00:53:59,519
high sulfur and that applies to compost

1409
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:02,338
too like you're just a lot of compost

1410
00:53:59,519 --> 00:54:05,460
you're going to see high sulfur so it's

1411
00:54:02,338 --> 00:54:09,000
a bit unavoidable in most organic

1412
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:11,039
systems and it doesn't create real

1413
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:13,380
negative effects in the plant but like I

1414
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:16,019
said if I could just wave a magic wand I

1415
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:17,880
would reduce it because it's it's uh

1416
00:54:16,019 --> 00:54:20,039
it's in luxury levels and it's putting

1417
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:21,900
upward pressure on EC

1418
00:54:20,039 --> 00:54:24,058
I

1419
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:25,019
let's see other nutrients I mean I

1420
00:54:24,059 --> 00:54:27,300
really like

1421
00:54:25,019 --> 00:54:29,699
high levels of calcium I've always liked

1422
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:31,619
running high levels of calcium

1423
00:54:29,699 --> 00:54:34,379
um I've never seen real negative effects

1424
00:54:31,619 --> 00:54:36,480
from that I

1425
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:38,400
have always

1426
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:40,318
liked

1427
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:42,539
um I don't wanna I don't wanna

1428
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:45,239
say high levels of any micronutrient

1429
00:54:42,539 --> 00:54:50,159
because that can you can run into issues

1430
00:54:45,239 --> 00:54:53,098
but compared to other crops and

1431
00:54:50,159 --> 00:54:56,639
um other just sort of Target levels of

1432
00:54:53,099 --> 00:54:59,099
nutrients I generally like slightly high

1433
00:54:56,639 --> 00:55:00,598
manganese and when I see luxury levels

1434
00:54:59,099 --> 00:55:02,338
of Manganese I'm not too worried about

1435
00:55:00,599 --> 00:55:04,019
it as long as it's not surpassing iron

1436
00:55:02,338 --> 00:55:06,960
and as long as the tissue test isn't

1437
00:55:04,019 --> 00:55:08,818
showing anything super out of whack

1438
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:13,699
um

1439
00:55:08,818 --> 00:55:13,699
luxury levels I mean potassium

1440
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:18,539
can be pretty high without concern

1441
00:55:16,199 --> 00:55:21,419
especially

1442
00:55:18,539 --> 00:55:22,739
um again as long as the calcium levels

1443
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:26,099
are high enough on the tissue test in

1444
00:55:22,739 --> 00:55:28,739
week two of flower I think having pretty

1445
00:55:26,099 --> 00:55:30,900
high potassium levels is not a problem

1446
00:55:28,739 --> 00:55:32,039
whatsoever

1447
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:34,200
um

1448
00:55:32,039 --> 00:55:36,719
I think that's about it I don't think I

1449
00:55:34,199 --> 00:55:38,279
want anything to be too excessive and

1450
00:55:36,719 --> 00:55:39,838
even the things I just named can be

1451
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:42,240
excessive I literally just looked at a

1452
00:55:39,838 --> 00:55:42,900
soil test and I recommended

1453
00:55:42,239 --> 00:55:45,058
um

1454
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:47,039
leaching because potassium was too high

1455
00:55:45,059 --> 00:55:49,140
so I'm I'm sort of putting my foot in my

1456
00:55:47,039 --> 00:55:50,880
mouth but I think those three nutrients

1457
00:55:49,139 --> 00:55:53,460
generally I like to see in pretty high

1458
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:56,960
levels that cannabis plants generally

1459
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:56,960
respond well to high concentrations

1460
00:55:57,980 --> 00:56:04,858
so some are just more concerning I guess

1461
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:06,539
um in terms of their detrimental or

1462
00:56:04,858 --> 00:56:08,098
negative effects at high levels versus

1463
00:56:06,539 --> 00:56:09,420
others that you're like okay it's high

1464
00:56:08,099 --> 00:56:11,460
but you're still going to get a good

1465
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:12,838
crop out of it absolutely exactly

1466
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:14,220
exactly and obviously we're talking

1467
00:56:12,838 --> 00:56:16,619
about like it depends on how high but

1468
00:56:14,219 --> 00:56:18,598
yeah I mean there's a pretty big range I

1469
00:56:16,619 --> 00:56:21,119
guess is my point that

1470
00:56:18,599 --> 00:56:22,140
um the plants will do pretty well in I

1471
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:24,300
think the

1472
00:56:22,139 --> 00:56:25,980
yeah I mean it's not like chloride or

1473
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:27,900
sodium or

1474
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:31,318
um copper

1475
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:33,920
I saw Copper at 60 parts per million I'd

1476
00:56:31,318 --> 00:56:33,920
be really worried

1477
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:38,700
that makes sense

1478
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:40,079
um well let's let's talk a little bit

1479
00:56:38,699 --> 00:56:40,699
about

1480
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:45,000
um

1481
00:56:40,699 --> 00:56:46,379
let's do some let's talk about uh some

1482
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,818
of the stuff you have going on here

1483
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:49,440
because you know we've given out a lot

1484
00:56:47,818 --> 00:56:51,960
of information here you have other

1485
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:53,519
resources available through slow doctor

1486
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:55,380
Consulting

1487
00:56:53,519 --> 00:56:58,679
um what are some of those things that

1488
00:56:55,380 --> 00:57:00,720
people can utilize you for

1489
00:56:58,679 --> 00:57:03,118
yeah thanks so

1490
00:57:00,719 --> 00:57:04,858
um pretty much my two major offerings

1491
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:07,019
the things that I obsess about every day

1492
00:57:04,858 --> 00:57:07,799
and think about all the time

1493
00:57:07,019 --> 00:57:10,079
um

1494
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:12,240
last year I put together a course called

1495
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:14,599
become a cannabis soil expert and it

1496
00:57:12,239 --> 00:57:17,879
includes it's a course that includes

1497
00:57:14,599 --> 00:57:19,619
over 12 hours of self-guided video

1498
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:22,019
content that details really everything

1499
00:57:19,619 --> 00:57:25,079
about organic nutrient Management in

1500
00:57:22,019 --> 00:57:27,599
cannabis so Growers can come become more

1501
00:57:25,079 --> 00:57:30,720
self-sufficient in managing their

1502
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:32,760
nutrition in-house and so I've put a lot

1503
00:57:30,719 --> 00:57:34,919
of time into that there's a number of

1504
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:36,359
different modules and dozens of videos

1505
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:39,480
that really just dive into the

1506
00:57:36,358 --> 00:57:42,058
fundamentals of techniques and soil

1507
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:43,740
targets and plant tissue targets and how

1508
00:57:42,059 --> 00:57:45,079
to amend soil and essentially write

1509
00:57:43,739 --> 00:57:48,959
their own program

1510
00:57:45,079 --> 00:57:51,380
taking control and having the confidence

1511
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:54,480
to do all this stuff organically

1512
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:55,500
in-house with data and precision which

1513
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:58,500
is something that I think has been

1514
00:57:55,500 --> 00:58:00,358
lacking in the industry for a while the

1515
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:02,880
other thing that I've been working on

1516
00:58:00,358 --> 00:58:06,960
obsessively every single day is this

1517
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:08,160
soil doctor tool which is a it's a it's

1518
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:11,940
a digital

1519
00:58:08,159 --> 00:58:13,980
I'll call it just a tool that's intended

1520
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:16,260
to sort of be a digital agronomist for

1521
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:18,719
nutrient management and cannabis so

1522
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:22,260
Growers enter a few pieces of

1523
00:58:18,719 --> 00:58:25,799
information about their their grow along

1524
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:27,180
with soil tests and the tool spits out a

1525
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:29,818
Precision organic nutrient

1526
00:58:27,179 --> 00:58:31,139
recommendation to assist in making a

1527
00:58:29,818 --> 00:58:34,440
decision about what to apply to your

1528
00:58:31,139 --> 00:58:36,838
soil and in what quantity and it uses a

1529
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:39,420
fairly complex mathematical model to

1530
00:58:36,838 --> 00:58:41,338
really determine the rates

1531
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:43,619
I want to dive into that but I don't

1532
00:58:41,338 --> 00:58:45,358
want to gloss over your soul course I

1533
00:58:43,619 --> 00:58:46,980
want to talk a little more about that uh

1534
00:58:45,358 --> 00:58:48,480
before we move on because I've I've

1535
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:49,318
taken the course

1536
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:52,079
um

1537
00:58:49,318 --> 00:58:54,179
I think it's probably the best online

1538
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:55,039
tool for cannabis Growers that want to

1539
00:58:54,179 --> 00:58:58,078
understand

1540
00:58:55,039 --> 00:59:00,119
how to properly amend your soil how to

1541
00:58:58,079 --> 00:59:00,780
soil test

1542
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:02,818
um

1543
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:06,780
what the different amendments are and

1544
00:59:02,818 --> 00:59:09,420
how to utilize them in your soil uh you

1545
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:12,900
give a lot of information in there and

1546
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:15,480
the ability to comment on the modules uh

1547
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:18,240
all the all the short videos I was able

1548
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:20,519
to do it over a period of a few weeks

1549
00:59:18,239 --> 00:59:22,199
I'm just kind of diving in and watching

1550
00:59:20,519 --> 00:59:24,358
a video here and there when I had time

1551
00:59:22,199 --> 00:59:26,219
kind of letting it mull over and process

1552
00:59:24,358 --> 00:59:29,460
and then coming back to it asking

1553
00:59:26,219 --> 00:59:32,159
questions and things like that so

1554
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:33,298
yeah I I don't want to just skip over

1555
00:59:32,159 --> 00:59:35,159
the fact that this is a pretty

1556
00:59:33,298 --> 00:59:36,679
comprehensive course that you've put

1557
00:59:35,159 --> 00:59:38,759
together I know it took

1558
00:59:36,679 --> 00:59:40,139
as someone who's working on putting

1559
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:41,579
together like a botany course and some

1560
00:59:40,139 --> 00:59:44,460
other tools I know how much work went

1561
00:59:41,579 --> 00:59:46,140
into that uh to create so yeah thanks

1562
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:47,940
thanks for your thanks for your positive

1563
00:59:46,139 --> 00:59:49,318
words the positive feedback I've gotten

1564
00:59:47,940 --> 00:59:52,380
from you and other Growers has been

1565
00:59:49,318 --> 00:59:54,480
really humbling so I appreciate it

1566
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:56,039
yeah are you adding to that at all or

1567
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:57,599
what are some of the things that you've

1568
00:59:56,039 --> 00:59:59,759
I know you've gone back and made some

1569
00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:01,260
changes as you're learning too which I

1570
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:02,119
think is really cool

1571
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:05,540
um yeah

1572
01:00:02,119 --> 01:00:09,059
yeah I added a

1573
01:00:05,539 --> 01:00:12,119
topsoil module so there's there's

1574
01:00:09,059 --> 01:00:15,480
there were originally five modules

1575
01:00:12,119 --> 01:00:17,700
um probably 10 hours of content and I

1576
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:19,019
added a sixth one on on outdoor

1577
01:00:17,699 --> 01:00:21,719
cultivation

1578
01:00:19,019 --> 01:00:22,679
and so which really was my bread and

1579
01:00:21,719 --> 01:00:24,838
butter

1580
01:00:22,679 --> 01:00:28,460
um years ago and so I just kind of go

1581
01:00:24,838 --> 01:00:30,719
into the different tools techniques

1582
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:32,760
cultivation techniques irrigation

1583
01:00:30,719 --> 01:00:35,399
techniques and and ultimately nutrient

1584
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:36,780
management methods for outdoor topsoil

1585
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:38,460
and that was the biggest addition in the

1586
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:41,579
last year and then I also go through and

1587
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:43,920
I yeah I update things as I learn more I

1588
01:00:41,579 --> 01:00:46,740
change some of the target levels as I as

1589
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:49,500
I go I try to do that on a six-month

1590
01:00:46,739 --> 01:00:53,519
basis and I only update the course when

1591
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:55,858
it's codified I'll change things in my

1592
01:00:53,519 --> 01:00:57,599
um my agronomic model or my Consulting

1593
01:00:55,858 --> 01:00:59,400
practice a little bit and I'll let that

1594
01:00:57,599 --> 01:01:00,780
run for six months before I update the

1595
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:03,838
course so the course is sort of the

1596
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:06,420
encyclopedia and I try not to update it

1597
01:01:03,838 --> 01:01:08,519
too much but I'm on there constantly as

1598
01:01:06,420 --> 01:01:10,559
soon as someone if someone asks a

1599
01:01:08,519 --> 01:01:12,599
question or if there's any conversation

1600
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:13,260
happening I'm on there

1601
01:01:12,599 --> 01:01:16,260
um

1602
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:18,359
that day within 24 hours so the updates

1603
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:20,400
happen usually on a six-month basis now

1604
01:01:18,358 --> 01:01:23,098
I would say for I'd be curious to hear

1605
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:25,858
Tad for listeners on a scale of one to

1606
01:01:23,099 --> 01:01:28,260
ten what what is the technical nature of

1607
01:01:25,858 --> 01:01:30,779
the course would you say

1608
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:32,940
10 being very technical very Advanced

1609
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:34,319
Growers only one being beginner Growers

1610
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:37,700
who have their you know are in their

1611
01:01:34,318 --> 01:01:37,699
first cycle in a tent

1612
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:43,980
that's a great question I think it's a

1613
01:01:41,579 --> 01:01:47,099
sliding scale a little bit so like the

1614
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:49,500
first section of the course to me was

1615
01:01:47,099 --> 01:01:52,619
sort of information I already knew

1616
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:54,599
um and no offense but it was you know it

1617
01:01:52,619 --> 01:01:57,119
was it was fairly basic in nature just

1618
01:01:54,599 --> 01:01:58,680
to give you a over line or an outline of

1619
01:01:57,119 --> 01:02:00,119
of sort of what these different

1620
01:01:58,679 --> 01:02:02,098
amendments are

1621
01:02:00,119 --> 01:02:03,780
uh you know what are your options for

1622
01:02:02,099 --> 01:02:05,338
nitrogen what are your options for for

1623
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:06,780
phosphorus passing these sorts of things

1624
01:02:05,338 --> 01:02:08,460
and then as you get further into the

1625
01:02:06,780 --> 01:02:10,559
course it gets you know it gets sort of

1626
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:13,440
as technical as you want it to be

1627
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:15,720
um in a lot of ways um the audience that

1628
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:18,298
listens to this podcast is is pretty

1629
01:02:15,719 --> 01:02:21,439
Savvy and pretty technical like I

1630
01:02:18,298 --> 01:02:24,119
I you know I've interviewed geneticists

1631
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:26,220
neuroscientists and you know people like

1632
01:02:24,119 --> 01:02:28,619
yourself that are experts in their field

1633
01:02:26,219 --> 01:02:29,459
and so I I feel like

1634
01:02:28,619 --> 01:02:31,019
um

1635
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:34,380
I'm kind of dancing around the answer

1636
01:02:31,019 --> 01:02:35,639
here uh I think this course is for

1637
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:37,680
anyone who's really passionate about

1638
01:02:35,639 --> 01:02:41,699
soil science and wants to understand the

1639
01:02:37,679 --> 01:02:42,598
why because it's one thing to be able to

1640
01:02:41,699 --> 01:02:44,578
um

1641
01:02:42,599 --> 01:02:46,980
you know take a soil test and send it

1642
01:02:44,579 --> 01:02:48,180
off to a consultant or plug it into a

1643
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:51,119
calculator and get a result but it's

1644
01:02:48,179 --> 01:02:53,460
another thing to kind of understand

1645
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:54,599
what's actually going on so that you can

1646
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:57,420
make

1647
01:02:54,599 --> 01:02:59,519
actionable decisions so

1648
01:02:57,420 --> 01:03:01,798
um I throw it like I guess overall maybe

1649
01:02:59,519 --> 01:03:04,079
a seven or an eight so

1650
01:03:01,798 --> 01:03:05,519
where I think it makes sense is either

1651
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:07,260
you're you're a hobbyist and you're

1652
01:03:05,519 --> 01:03:08,639
super passionate about soil science and

1653
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:11,880
gardening or if you're a commercial

1654
01:03:08,639 --> 01:03:14,039
cultivator that's using Organics and not

1655
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:16,559
working you know closely with an

1656
01:03:14,039 --> 01:03:18,179
agronomist or consultant or a company

1657
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:19,559
that can do those things for you then I

1658
01:03:18,179 --> 01:03:21,019
think this is knowledge you absolutely

1659
01:03:19,559 --> 01:03:24,540
have

1660
01:03:21,019 --> 01:03:27,059
and uh

1661
01:03:24,539 --> 01:03:29,219
I think that's my answer I will add that

1662
01:03:27,059 --> 01:03:31,619
it's you know it's not uh

1663
01:03:29,219 --> 01:03:33,118
it's not a low price point um of Entry

1664
01:03:31,619 --> 01:03:34,798
it's an expensive course because of the

1665
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:36,599
amount of time and energy and research

1666
01:03:34,798 --> 01:03:38,280
that goes into it not just in creating

1667
01:03:36,599 --> 01:03:39,660
it but learning the material to be able

1668
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:41,220
to teach it

1669
01:03:39,659 --> 01:03:44,399
um but I think that's very affordable

1670
01:03:41,219 --> 01:03:47,039
when we talk about a commercial

1671
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:50,160
cultivator

1672
01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:51,900
for a tent grower it may not be uh it

1673
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:52,739
may not be in the budget unless it's

1674
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:54,780
something you're really really

1675
01:03:52,739 --> 01:03:55,679
passionate about does that kind of

1676
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:58,680
answer it

1677
01:03:55,679 --> 01:04:00,539
yeah no I appreciate that I I I'm I have

1678
01:03:58,679 --> 01:04:01,858
that Curiosity because I don't know you

1679
01:04:00,539 --> 01:04:04,440
know

1680
01:04:01,858 --> 01:04:05,880
what level it's at to other people but I

1681
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:06,960
also think I asked that just because I

1682
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:09,420
wanted

1683
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:11,760
maybe to highlight the that yeah it's

1684
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:13,680
for it's for passion and Growers

1685
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:16,020
it's not it's like it's not necessarily

1686
01:04:13,679 --> 01:04:17,578
a dabbling course I don't think

1687
01:04:16,019 --> 01:04:18,719
um maybe the first module is like you

1688
01:04:17,579 --> 01:04:21,000
said

1689
01:04:18,719 --> 01:04:22,558
no not at all like I think you're I

1690
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:24,179
think you're right on it is

1691
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:27,420
um it is challenging it makes you think

1692
01:04:24,179 --> 01:04:29,879
it's like taking a a course in sort of

1693
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:33,960
soil science with an emphasis on soil

1694
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:36,000
testing and I think uh soil is media in

1695
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:37,980
a lot of ways so if if you wanna if you

1696
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:40,739
want to understand why

1697
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:42,420
the local agronomist doesn't give you a

1698
01:04:40,739 --> 01:04:44,399
good recommendation for your cannabis

1699
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:47,159
grow because they're looking at you know

1700
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:48,780
a Logan soil test and trying to

1701
01:04:47,159 --> 01:04:50,039
understand why your potting soil is

1702
01:04:48,780 --> 01:04:51,420
performing differently well this would

1703
01:04:50,039 --> 01:04:53,759
explain it to you

1704
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:56,159
yeah great

1705
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:58,440
um yeah and it covers you know like

1706
01:04:56,159 --> 01:05:01,940
liquid feed recipes and foliers and

1707
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:04,380
various subtopics but really the the

1708
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:06,119
basis and the meat of the course is

1709
01:05:04,380 --> 01:05:08,039
organic

1710
01:05:06,119 --> 01:05:11,039
soil base or I guess we should

1711
01:05:08,039 --> 01:05:13,679
peat-based uh cannabis cultivation so I

1712
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:15,358
think people often ask like people

1713
01:05:13,679 --> 01:05:17,879
people often ask is it would it benefit

1714
01:05:15,358 --> 01:05:20,039
me if I'm if I'm not an organic grower

1715
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:22,619
and

1716
01:05:20,039 --> 01:05:24,719
the answer is I some of the principles

1717
01:05:22,619 --> 01:05:26,640
the principles absolutely

1718
01:05:24,719 --> 01:05:29,759
but

1719
01:05:26,639 --> 01:05:31,440
all of the targets and the general uh

1720
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:32,460
approach is definitely an organic

1721
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:35,220
approach

1722
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:37,500
um I don't really talk about your rears

1723
01:05:35,219 --> 01:05:40,019
or you know polymer coded

1724
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:44,219
fertility it's just it's it's very much

1725
01:05:40,019 --> 01:05:47,280
an organic based approach so anyway

1726
01:05:44,219 --> 01:05:49,019
that's that's a good point yeah

1727
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:51,839
um okay well I'll let you move on to

1728
01:05:49,019 --> 01:05:54,000
explaining the the tool now oh yeah okay

1729
01:05:51,838 --> 01:05:56,279
so the tool is another extension yeah

1730
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:59,159
the tool is an extension of this General

1731
01:05:56,280 --> 01:06:02,579
philosophy that that comes from the

1732
01:05:59,159 --> 01:06:04,500
course too which is test don't guess

1733
01:06:02,579 --> 01:06:06,599
um you know my my Approach with the

1734
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:09,539
course and with this tool

1735
01:06:06,599 --> 01:06:11,760
um is to recommend only what's needed to

1736
01:06:09,539 --> 01:06:13,079
improve plant metabolism so this tools

1737
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:14,579
you know you enter information about

1738
01:06:13,079 --> 01:06:16,859
your grow

1739
01:06:14,579 --> 01:06:20,220
um your soil tests and it it does this

1740
01:06:16,858 --> 01:06:23,699
complex mathematical calculation

1741
01:06:20,219 --> 01:06:26,159
um to determine Amendment rates and it's

1742
01:06:23,699 --> 01:06:28,500
the opposite of the traditional kitchen

1743
01:06:26,159 --> 01:06:31,399
sink approach in which we throw every

1744
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:33,780
biostimulant enzyme ferment microbe and

1745
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:36,660
nutrient at the plant and hope for the

1746
01:06:33,780 --> 01:06:38,160
bed the best so you can still Growers

1747
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:39,899
can still do that you can apply your

1748
01:06:38,159 --> 01:06:42,358
special sauce whether that's a fungal

1749
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:45,358
compost extract or a high-end silica

1750
01:06:42,358 --> 01:06:48,358
foliar or a micronized calcium

1751
01:06:45,358 --> 01:06:50,338
or k ferment whatever in addition

1752
01:06:48,358 --> 01:06:52,558
to the Amendments from the tool but the

1753
01:06:50,338 --> 01:06:54,179
tool is really supposed to hit the the

1754
01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:56,400
low hanging fruit

1755
01:06:54,179 --> 01:06:58,318
and it does so with data and precision

1756
01:06:56,400 --> 01:07:00,599
because this the industry has always

1757
01:06:58,318 --> 01:07:03,558
been so full of like you know blood

1758
01:07:00,599 --> 01:07:07,200
Blaster RX for terpenes or bio catalyze

1759
01:07:03,559 --> 01:07:11,640
for microbes or whatever fulvic biochar

1760
01:07:07,199 --> 01:07:14,038
sprouted cow mag foliar so you know I I

1761
01:07:11,639 --> 01:07:17,279
do you know I I do a lot of things in my

1762
01:07:14,039 --> 01:07:20,339
When I grow cannabis and in my Orchard

1763
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:22,980
that are Beyond just the bare minimum I

1764
01:07:20,338 --> 01:07:24,779
had I love a lot of that stuff but I

1765
01:07:22,980 --> 01:07:26,639
guess my point is you have to start with

1766
01:07:24,780 --> 01:07:30,000
the fundamentals first you have to make

1767
01:07:26,639 --> 01:07:31,980
sure that nutrients are sufficient

1768
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:34,019
available balanced

1769
01:07:31,980 --> 01:07:35,940
um before all of that other stuff and so

1770
01:07:34,019 --> 01:07:40,739
this tool is really intended to make

1771
01:07:35,940 --> 01:07:42,059
very accurate recommendations to make

1772
01:07:40,739 --> 01:07:43,739
sure that all of the macro and

1773
01:07:42,059 --> 01:07:47,700
micronutrients essential for the plant

1774
01:07:43,739 --> 01:07:49,318
are in your soil in the best way

1775
01:07:47,699 --> 01:07:50,818
possible

1776
01:07:49,318 --> 01:07:52,858
foreign

1777
01:07:50,818 --> 01:07:53,940
yeah that's I think that's I want to go

1778
01:07:52,858 --> 01:07:55,619
back and highlight what you just said

1779
01:07:53,940 --> 01:07:59,039
because that's so important I see

1780
01:07:55,619 --> 01:08:01,079
companies marketing product based grow

1781
01:07:59,039 --> 01:08:04,079
methodologies all the time you know like

1782
01:08:01,079 --> 01:08:06,359
add this product add that product

1783
01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:07,798
um and you can absolutely do that and

1784
01:08:06,358 --> 01:08:10,019
like you said you can use all of these

1785
01:08:07,798 --> 01:08:11,639
ferments and and other things but at the

1786
01:08:10,019 --> 01:08:15,480
end of the day if you don't have

1787
01:08:11,639 --> 01:08:18,960
sufficiency in your major your your

1788
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:20,759
major nutrients uh it's not going to

1789
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:22,319
matter that that's going to be your

1790
01:08:20,759 --> 01:08:24,119
limiting factor growth so I always start

1791
01:08:22,319 --> 01:08:26,100
with what's my limiting factor of growth

1792
01:08:24,119 --> 01:08:29,640
and if it's fertility I want to figure

1793
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:30,660
out what cation or anion it is and then

1794
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:33,298
if

1795
01:08:30,659 --> 01:08:35,759
you know you apply some sort of pumpkin

1796
01:08:33,298 --> 01:08:37,859
extract and you get a plant response I

1797
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:40,560
want to figure out why rather than

1798
01:08:37,859 --> 01:08:41,880
continuing to buy a product that's you

1799
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:44,160
know mostly liquid and probably

1800
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:45,179
overpriced I want to know what what is

1801
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:46,439
in there that's making a difference

1802
01:08:45,179 --> 01:08:47,819
because it means you have something

1803
01:08:46,439 --> 01:08:48,960
that's limiting your plants health or

1804
01:08:47,819 --> 01:08:51,900
growth

1805
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:53,698
um and so I start with sufficiency start

1806
01:08:51,899 --> 01:08:56,698
with a good foundation like you said and

1807
01:08:53,698 --> 01:08:59,039
and something that's interesting because

1808
01:08:56,698 --> 01:09:01,079
when I first started I started off using

1809
01:08:59,039 --> 01:09:02,819
these Soul calculators the the initial

1810
01:09:01,079 --> 01:09:04,019
ones were based off of

1811
01:09:02,819 --> 01:09:07,319
um

1812
01:09:04,020 --> 01:09:10,380
and getting uh nutrient density so not

1813
01:09:07,319 --> 01:09:12,239
necessarily optimal yields when we talk

1814
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:14,460
about cannabis but just an overall

1815
01:09:12,238 --> 01:09:17,519
sufficiency of or are not even

1816
01:09:14,460 --> 01:09:19,439
sufficiency but higher levels of of

1817
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:22,520
nutrient fertility to make sure that

1818
01:09:19,439 --> 01:09:25,139
that grown edible crop is going to be

1819
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:27,239
healthier sort of the Steve Solomon's

1820
01:09:25,140 --> 01:09:29,460
approach essentially

1821
01:09:27,238 --> 01:09:31,379
when it worked it works okay it works

1822
01:09:29,460 --> 01:09:32,520
fine and you get you get some good

1823
01:09:31,380 --> 01:09:34,619
information from there and those

1824
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:36,120
calculators you know are not bad and

1825
01:09:34,619 --> 01:09:40,140
then there's I've seen other calculators

1826
01:09:36,119 --> 01:09:42,479
come out for cannabis too but for me

1827
01:09:40,140 --> 01:09:44,219
there's more information I want than

1828
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:46,500
just what's on a soil test when I'm

1829
01:09:44,219 --> 01:09:49,980
evaluating a garden and trying to make

1830
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:52,079
Amendment recommendations and you know

1831
01:09:49,979 --> 01:09:55,759
the the tool that you put together

1832
01:09:52,079 --> 01:09:58,380
uh has other variables

1833
01:09:55,760 --> 01:10:00,060
associated with that and and so can you

1834
01:09:58,380 --> 01:10:01,319
kind of talk about what those are and

1835
01:10:00,060 --> 01:10:04,199
why they're important

1836
01:10:01,319 --> 01:10:06,000
yeah sure so when I think about I just

1837
01:10:04,198 --> 01:10:08,399
want to step back and when I think about

1838
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:12,179
photosynthesis I think about light

1839
01:10:08,399 --> 01:10:16,379
think about CO2 water temperature and

1840
01:10:12,179 --> 01:10:19,380
nutrients and this tool

1841
01:10:16,380 --> 01:10:21,179
is only focused on the nutrient part of

1842
01:10:19,380 --> 01:10:24,359
it helping Growers

1843
01:10:21,179 --> 01:10:26,719
understand and apply nutrients in a

1844
01:10:24,359 --> 01:10:30,059
better more precise way

1845
01:10:26,719 --> 01:10:31,679
to focus on that bottleneck of

1846
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:33,659
photosynthesis so if your environment's

1847
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:35,579
off this tool isn't necessarily going to

1848
01:10:33,658 --> 01:10:38,279
help if you're not watering correctly

1849
01:10:35,579 --> 01:10:40,619
this this doesn't is it's not going to

1850
01:10:38,279 --> 01:10:42,359
address that and I think that you've

1851
01:10:40,619 --> 01:10:43,380
been really good

1852
01:10:42,359 --> 01:10:45,719
um

1853
01:10:43,380 --> 01:10:47,819
at pointing out that this isn't a

1854
01:10:45,719 --> 01:10:49,920
Panacea for growing it's not like an

1855
01:10:47,819 --> 01:10:52,139
automated you know it's not going to

1856
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:54,300
solve all your problems but the idea

1857
01:10:52,140 --> 01:10:56,460
here is it's focused on nutrient

1858
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:58,739
management so the variables when you go

1859
01:10:56,460 --> 01:11:00,840
into the tool you set up an area

1860
01:10:58,738 --> 01:11:03,119
and you choose whether you're indoor or

1861
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:04,739
outdoor because that matters you also

1862
01:11:03,119 --> 01:11:06,619
choose your cycle length because the

1863
01:11:04,738 --> 01:11:08,639
tool changes nutrient levels slightly

1864
01:11:06,619 --> 01:11:11,099
depending on if your plants are going to

1865
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:13,260
be in the soil for less than 12 weeks or

1866
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:14,520
longer than 16 weeks so for example the

1867
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:17,699
nitrogen Amendment quantities are

1868
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:19,739
increased a bit for a long-term or

1869
01:11:17,698 --> 01:11:21,960
full-term crop versus a soil intended

1870
01:11:19,738 --> 01:11:23,218
for like a nine week flower I'll add

1871
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:24,840
that the difference here is relatively

1872
01:11:23,219 --> 01:11:26,340
small because like I said I like to

1873
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:27,260
maintain

1874
01:11:26,340 --> 01:11:29,279
um

1875
01:11:27,260 --> 01:11:31,100
concentrations as opposed to trying to

1876
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:33,420
pre-load too heavily

1877
01:11:31,100 --> 01:11:34,920
but there's a happy balance that the

1878
01:11:33,420 --> 01:11:36,600
tool is trying to achieve there it also

1879
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:38,279
it also asks you for your soil volume

1880
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:40,079
which is a big deal as anyone who's

1881
01:11:38,279 --> 01:11:41,519
grown in a seven gallon pot versus a 30

1882
01:11:40,079 --> 01:11:43,979
gallon pot

1883
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:46,800
um there's a difference there

1884
01:11:43,979 --> 01:11:49,439
and the tool actually out takes your

1885
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:51,360
soil volume and it outputs the quantity

1886
01:11:49,439 --> 01:11:53,759
of amendments for your entire soil

1887
01:11:51,359 --> 01:11:55,198
volume as well as per just a you know a

1888
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:56,400
cubic yard of soil so you can kind of

1889
01:11:55,198 --> 01:11:58,379
choose

1890
01:11:56,399 --> 01:12:00,658
um which which way you go there

1891
01:11:58,380 --> 01:12:03,600
and then it also when you're setting up

1892
01:12:00,658 --> 01:12:04,979
an area asks for uh your compost and

1893
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:07,500
this is an interesting conversation that

1894
01:12:04,979 --> 01:12:10,319
we've had to add compost might be the

1895
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:12,000
biggest variable in living soil nutrient

1896
01:12:10,319 --> 01:12:14,279
management because all composts are

1897
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:17,158
wildly different so the tool asks for

1898
01:12:14,279 --> 01:12:19,079
the nutrient levels on the compost

1899
01:12:17,158 --> 01:12:21,238
um from a compost analysis which most

1900
01:12:19,079 --> 01:12:22,800
Growers don't have and that's okay and

1901
01:12:21,238 --> 01:12:24,539
if you don't have it it asks for what

1902
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:27,000
the compost is made out of so at least

1903
01:12:24,539 --> 01:12:28,859
it can make an estimate it can model the

1904
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:30,119
nutrient numbers based on the feedstocks

1905
01:12:28,859 --> 01:12:33,019
of that compost

1906
01:12:30,119 --> 01:12:33,019
foreign

1907
01:12:33,198 --> 01:12:35,819
I just want to add to that because one

1908
01:12:35,158 --> 01:12:37,979
of the things we're going to talk about

1909
01:12:35,819 --> 01:12:40,079
with soul recipes but I I don't think we

1910
01:12:37,979 --> 01:12:42,899
have time but the one thing I want to

1911
01:12:40,079 --> 01:12:44,939
highlight there is that uh I see people

1912
01:12:42,899 --> 01:12:48,299
in forums still all the time saying oh

1913
01:12:44,939 --> 01:12:49,919
I'm gonna run Mike's mix or John's Bloom

1914
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:50,579
mix or whatever

1915
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:53,158
um

1916
01:12:50,579 --> 01:12:55,260
but really all of these online slow

1917
01:12:53,158 --> 01:12:57,539
recipes are going to be somewhat

1918
01:12:55,260 --> 01:12:58,380
inaccurate just because they're all

1919
01:12:57,539 --> 01:13:00,119
going to be sourced from different

1920
01:12:58,380 --> 01:13:03,480
compost so if you really want to

1921
01:13:00,119 --> 01:13:05,819
formulate a soil or you know a potting

1922
01:13:03,479 --> 01:13:07,500
soil or a media correctly it needs to

1923
01:13:05,819 --> 01:13:10,079
start being formulated around what

1924
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:13,380
fertility is in your compost so it's one

1925
01:13:10,079 --> 01:13:16,500
of the 300 yep 100 a combo is made out

1926
01:13:13,380 --> 01:13:18,840
of fish and hardwood aged for a year

1927
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:23,100
versus a compost made out of yard waste

1928
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:25,860
turn six times in six weeks in oh yeah

1929
01:13:23,100 --> 01:13:29,039
Middle America versus a compost made out

1930
01:13:25,859 --> 01:13:31,920
of lobster waste on the East Coast the

1931
01:13:29,039 --> 01:13:33,779
the nutrient profile between those three

1932
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:35,039
is striking the difference the

1933
01:13:33,779 --> 01:13:37,559
difference in the nutrient profile is

1934
01:13:35,039 --> 01:13:38,460
striking so yeah

1935
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:40,380
um

1936
01:13:38,460 --> 01:13:41,819
and then and then the only other thing

1937
01:13:40,380 --> 01:13:44,159
that you would enter in the soil doctor

1938
01:13:41,819 --> 01:13:46,019
tool in the area section is is that your

1939
01:13:44,158 --> 01:13:47,399
preferred nitrogen sources so Growers

1940
01:13:46,020 --> 01:13:49,560
get to choose up to four nitrogen

1941
01:13:47,399 --> 01:13:50,819
amendments that the recommendation will

1942
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:52,940
use

1943
01:13:50,819 --> 01:13:55,319
um our default is usually to use four

1944
01:13:52,939 --> 01:13:56,939
soybean meal alfalfa meal granular

1945
01:13:55,319 --> 01:13:59,099
poultry manure and blood meal to

1946
01:13:56,939 --> 01:14:00,479
optimize nitrogen release rates and

1947
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:02,640
microbial diversity but it doesn't

1948
01:14:00,479 --> 01:14:04,079
really matter honestly like I think the

1949
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:05,340
most important thing is for Growers to

1950
01:14:04,079 --> 01:14:06,840
do their own research and choose the

1951
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:09,840
best sources of nitrogen for their

1952
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:12,179
operation and for their values

1953
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:14,520
um and there's very subtle pros and cons

1954
01:14:12,179 --> 01:14:17,039
of nitrogen sources but the point is

1955
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:17,640
that people can customize

1956
01:14:17,039 --> 01:14:19,319
um

1957
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:22,079
the output a bit based on their

1958
01:14:19,319 --> 01:14:24,179
Amendment preferences

1959
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:28,738
um so yeah I mean the inputs to the

1960
01:14:24,179 --> 01:14:30,658
model are taking as many things as

1961
01:14:28,738 --> 01:14:32,099
possible that influence nutrient

1962
01:14:30,658 --> 01:14:33,420
management and trying to account for

1963
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:36,480
those and trying to change the

1964
01:14:33,420 --> 01:14:39,260
recommendations and trying to model the

1965
01:14:36,479 --> 01:14:42,539
entire nutrient system in an organic

1966
01:14:39,260 --> 01:14:46,699
way and use data from both the standard

1967
01:14:42,539 --> 01:14:50,939
and paste test to spit out a calculated

1968
01:14:46,698 --> 01:14:52,619
recommendation as a guidance tool so I

1969
01:14:50,939 --> 01:14:54,779
always I'd like to tell people that the

1970
01:14:52,619 --> 01:14:56,460
recommendations are guidance it's like

1971
01:14:54,779 --> 01:14:59,399
okay based on all the information I have

1972
01:14:56,460 --> 01:15:01,260
here's the best advice I can give

1973
01:14:59,399 --> 01:15:03,179
um and you get a fairly comprehensive

1974
01:15:01,260 --> 01:15:05,400
recommendation with notes about the soil

1975
01:15:03,179 --> 01:15:07,020
and precision you know recommendations

1976
01:15:05,399 --> 01:15:09,238
and a bunch of tips about how to apply

1977
01:15:07,020 --> 01:15:11,580
the Amendments the report is is pretty

1978
01:15:09,238 --> 01:15:13,559
awesome and so that's kind of what I've

1979
01:15:11,579 --> 01:15:14,819
been working on and honestly for it's

1980
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:16,199
like five years in the making because

1981
01:15:14,819 --> 01:15:19,439
I've been

1982
01:15:16,198 --> 01:15:22,198
I've just gone so deep into this that uh

1983
01:15:19,439 --> 01:15:24,599
there's just a lot of you know

1984
01:15:22,198 --> 01:15:26,698
dozens of conversations and I think I've

1985
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:29,280
looked at like 5 000 peat-based soil

1986
01:15:26,698 --> 01:15:30,419
tests and done calibration experiments

1987
01:15:29,279 --> 01:15:33,300
and

1988
01:15:30,420 --> 01:15:34,079
um taken just classic agronomic

1989
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:36,539
um

1990
01:15:34,079 --> 01:15:39,359
research and all tried to incorporate it

1991
01:15:36,539 --> 01:15:41,479
into this this one tool for Growers to

1992
01:15:39,359 --> 01:15:41,479
use

1993
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:46,320
yeah I looked into doing something like

1994
01:15:44,399 --> 01:15:48,119
this years ago and frankly I just

1995
01:15:46,319 --> 01:15:50,399
realized I didn't have the brain power

1996
01:15:48,119 --> 01:15:53,158
to uh calculate for all the variables

1997
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:56,579
that I really wanted to in a

1998
01:15:53,158 --> 01:15:59,279
in a tool and you've gotten more in

1999
01:15:56,579 --> 01:16:02,039
there than anyone else I've seen it's

2000
01:15:59,279 --> 01:16:02,639
pretty it's pretty impressive honestly

2001
01:16:02,039 --> 01:16:04,979
um

2002
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:08,100
that you're able to pull that together

2003
01:16:04,979 --> 01:16:08,879
yeah and I will say like

2004
01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:10,679
um

2005
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:13,679
you know when I when I sit down with a

2006
01:16:10,679 --> 01:16:16,079
grower or Brandon who works with me um

2007
01:16:13,679 --> 01:16:17,640
on that we'll look at you know

2008
01:16:16,079 --> 01:16:19,859
because because we're having a

2009
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:21,659
conversation with the grower we can we

2010
01:16:19,859 --> 01:16:23,219
have them send us photos and we look at

2011
01:16:21,658 --> 01:16:24,960
videos sometimes with their grow space

2012
01:16:23,219 --> 01:16:26,760
or we'll look at

2013
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:29,039
um you know can we look at the photos of

2014
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:31,380
the plant uh up close if you're having

2015
01:16:29,039 --> 01:16:33,060
challenges plus uh you know entire the

2016
01:16:31,380 --> 01:16:35,880
entire plan so we can look at for hidden

2017
01:16:33,060 --> 01:16:36,960
and mobile nutrient issues uh

2018
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:38,279
um you know we check on what their

2019
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:40,619
environment is all of these different

2020
01:16:38,279 --> 01:16:42,000
things that can affect again just trying

2021
01:16:40,619 --> 01:16:44,460
to figure out what that limiting factor

2022
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:48,179
of growth is and if it is indeed

2023
01:16:44,460 --> 01:16:49,819
fertility but barring the ability to do

2024
01:16:48,179 --> 01:16:51,840
a full-on like

2025
01:16:49,819 --> 01:16:54,238
comprehensive console which is something

2026
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:55,739
that you offer too if people want to go

2027
01:16:54,238 --> 01:16:58,079
down that route I think this is the best

2028
01:16:55,738 --> 01:17:00,299
available online tool out there and if I

2029
01:16:58,079 --> 01:17:02,640
were if I were a grower and just looking

2030
01:17:00,300 --> 01:17:04,020
to get you know I had a soil test and I

2031
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:06,360
needed to get a result

2032
01:17:04,020 --> 01:17:08,460
um and I wanted to do it affordably I

2033
01:17:06,359 --> 01:17:10,619
would absolutely use

2034
01:17:08,460 --> 01:17:12,899
your soil doctor tool I think it's I

2035
01:17:10,619 --> 01:17:14,039
think it's awesome so yeah thanks a lot

2036
01:17:12,899 --> 01:17:15,359
I appreciate it and it's one of those

2037
01:17:14,039 --> 01:17:17,760
things where it's like

2038
01:17:15,359 --> 01:17:23,639
I sort of leave it up to

2039
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:26,760
head Growers or you and Brandon our IPM

2040
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:29,159
experts to like really identify in the

2041
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:30,659
Top Lane thyroid or you know like a

2042
01:17:29,158 --> 01:17:33,119
watering issue there's so many things I

2043
01:17:30,658 --> 01:17:35,158
just can't address oh I can't address

2044
01:17:33,119 --> 01:17:37,439
all of it so the tool is really intended

2045
01:17:35,158 --> 01:17:39,658
to be it is intended to be like just

2046
01:17:37,439 --> 01:17:41,639
focused on one specific area where you

2047
01:17:39,658 --> 01:17:44,219
guys could use the tool in your more

2048
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:46,980
holistic analysis so it's not yeah I

2049
01:17:44,219 --> 01:17:50,100
wouldn't call this a holistic agronomic

2050
01:17:46,979 --> 01:17:53,218
tool it is a nutrient organic nutrient

2051
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:56,280
management tool so

2052
01:17:53,219 --> 01:17:57,179
yeah no that's that's great

2053
01:17:56,279 --> 01:17:58,979
um

2054
01:17:57,179 --> 01:18:01,980
well we've already been talking for over

2055
01:17:58,979 --> 01:18:03,599
an hour here uh I I could I could talk

2056
01:18:01,979 --> 01:18:04,799
to you all day honestly I love all of

2057
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:06,960
our conversations I always learn

2058
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:09,539
something new uh was there anything else

2059
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:11,100
you wanted to share though before we uh

2060
01:18:09,539 --> 01:18:12,719
before we sign off

2061
01:18:11,100 --> 01:18:14,520
you know I don't think so

2062
01:18:12,719 --> 01:18:16,679
um

2063
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:18,300
yeah we could we could go on and on I

2064
01:18:16,679 --> 01:18:21,480
feel like we do sometimes

2065
01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:22,860
um even in preparation you called me

2066
01:18:21,479 --> 01:18:25,139
asked me to come on and we ended up

2067
01:18:22,859 --> 01:18:28,019
talking for an hour so it's easy to to

2068
01:18:25,140 --> 01:18:29,100
burn an hour talking about these topics

2069
01:18:28,020 --> 01:18:31,500
um but no there's nothing else that's

2070
01:18:29,100 --> 01:18:32,460
popping out in my head I think

2071
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:34,140
um

2072
01:18:32,460 --> 01:18:36,000
something I've been really excited about

2073
01:18:34,140 --> 01:18:39,840
and thinking just more about in general

2074
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:41,640
is just particle size of amendments

2075
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:43,319
and there's always the topic of water

2076
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:44,760
and pH adjustment but I think we

2077
01:18:43,319 --> 01:18:47,519
actually addressed that in our in the

2078
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:50,280
last podcast and I'm happy to to chat

2079
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:52,320
about that at a later point on a on a

2080
01:18:50,279 --> 01:18:54,539
live video or another podcast because

2081
01:18:52,319 --> 01:18:56,158
those are big topics

2082
01:18:54,539 --> 01:18:59,279
yeah I'd love to get you back on I mean

2083
01:18:56,158 --> 01:19:02,279
lately what's been on my mind is uh

2084
01:18:59,279 --> 01:19:03,779
watering as well I think that's always

2085
01:19:02,279 --> 01:19:05,579
something that I'm always thinking about

2086
01:19:03,779 --> 01:19:06,719
uh you know I mentioned I just got a

2087
01:19:05,579 --> 01:19:09,059
bunch of house plants and so I'm

2088
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:10,679
learning how to water differently for

2089
01:19:09,060 --> 01:19:13,380
different plants in different media

2090
01:19:10,679 --> 01:19:17,100
which has been really interesting and

2091
01:19:13,380 --> 01:19:19,199
then also heavy metals just um

2092
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:21,659
there's so much there that we have to

2093
01:19:19,198 --> 01:19:25,079
learn and there's so many variables that

2094
01:19:21,658 --> 01:19:27,059
affect heavy metal uptake that um

2095
01:19:25,079 --> 01:19:29,640
I I it's one of those topics that I just

2096
01:19:27,060 --> 01:19:31,560
I I keep learning more and more about

2097
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:33,000
and and I'm I'm interested anymore

2098
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:34,260
because I also think about my health

2099
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,698
like

2100
01:19:34,260 --> 01:19:37,980
I mentioned this the other day on a

2101
01:19:35,698 --> 01:19:39,479
podcast I was in I was in Costco the

2102
01:19:37,979 --> 01:19:44,218
other day and I was

2103
01:19:39,479 --> 01:19:45,419
um looking at some organically grown

2104
01:19:44,219 --> 01:19:47,579
um

2105
01:19:45,420 --> 01:19:49,800
what was it uh

2106
01:19:47,579 --> 01:19:51,479
trying to remember the vegetable it

2107
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:55,560
might have been um

2108
01:19:51,479 --> 01:19:57,299
let's just let's just say uh tomatoes uh

2109
01:19:55,560 --> 01:20:00,600
so I was looking at organic tomatoes

2110
01:19:57,300 --> 01:20:02,880
grown in Mexico versus uh Greenhouse

2111
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:05,760
grown tomatoes conventionally grown in

2112
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:07,640
California which is actually going to be

2113
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:09,780
healthier for my family

2114
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:11,659
there was once in Mexico I don't really

2115
01:20:09,779 --> 01:20:14,039
know what the heavy metals levels are

2116
01:20:11,658 --> 01:20:17,779
they probably weren't a ton of

2117
01:20:14,039 --> 01:20:20,579
pesticides applied necessarily or other

2118
01:20:17,779 --> 01:20:22,979
inputs that I might have issue with on

2119
01:20:20,579 --> 01:20:24,479
that Greenhouse or hot house grown

2120
01:20:22,979 --> 01:20:25,079
tomato I don't know

2121
01:20:24,479 --> 01:20:26,698
um

2122
01:20:25,079 --> 01:20:28,679
it definitely I'm definitely thinking

2123
01:20:26,698 --> 01:20:31,259
Less in terms of Organics versus like

2124
01:20:28,679 --> 01:20:34,679
conventional and More in terms of like

2125
01:20:31,260 --> 01:20:36,000
healthy and sustainable if that makes

2126
01:20:34,679 --> 01:20:38,279
sense

2127
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:40,020
yeah absolutely yeah I mean I I think a

2128
01:20:38,279 --> 01:20:41,939
lot about

2129
01:20:40,020 --> 01:20:44,040
nutrient density I always have again

2130
01:20:41,939 --> 01:20:46,500
Steve Solomon was I find a major like

2131
01:20:44,039 --> 01:20:48,600
pioneer in that space for me I got

2132
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:50,039
started with his book probably 10 years

2133
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:53,579
ago or something

2134
01:20:50,039 --> 01:20:55,380
and yeah it is just such a it is such an

2135
01:20:53,579 --> 01:20:56,519
important thing and I'm curious if ever

2136
01:20:55,380 --> 01:20:58,619
in our lifetime we're going to be able

2137
01:20:56,520 --> 01:21:00,300
to quantify that be really nice to know

2138
01:20:58,619 --> 01:21:03,479
the other thing I think a lot about is

2139
01:21:00,300 --> 01:21:05,340
because I know how crops are grown

2140
01:21:03,479 --> 01:21:07,919
um a lot of them not all of them but

2141
01:21:05,340 --> 01:21:11,460
sometimes I know what's more likely to

2142
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:12,658
be sprayed and what's not so like you

2143
01:21:11,460 --> 01:21:15,480
know strawberries for example always

2144
01:21:12,658 --> 01:21:18,539
freaked me out I tend to oh yeah yeah

2145
01:21:15,479 --> 01:21:20,339
tend to uh but but like and sometimes

2146
01:21:18,539 --> 01:21:23,640
sometimes I think that stuff got pretty

2147
01:21:20,340 --> 01:21:25,500
Pest and disease-free crop so yeah

2148
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:26,820
there's so many it's a very complicated

2149
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:30,439
World

2150
01:21:26,819 --> 01:21:30,439
um when we start importing food

2151
01:21:31,020 --> 01:21:35,159
yeah well I again I appreciate your time

2152
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:37,079
maybe that's another conversation that

2153
01:21:35,158 --> 01:21:38,698
people are interested too

2154
01:21:37,079 --> 01:21:40,619
um because it's something I've been

2155
01:21:38,698 --> 01:21:42,119
thinking about a lot as well let me let

2156
01:21:40,619 --> 01:21:44,519
me leave one more thought for the

2157
01:21:42,119 --> 01:21:46,500
Cannabis Community as pre you know in

2158
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:48,960
like this this era of sort of low prices

2159
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:49,859
and a contraction in the market and

2160
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:52,500
things

2161
01:21:49,859 --> 01:21:54,839
you mentioned Costco

2162
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:57,359
and I think three years ago I did a big

2163
01:21:54,840 --> 01:22:00,539
fun project with a massive organic

2164
01:21:57,359 --> 01:22:02,939
blueberry farm in Pacific Northwest and

2165
01:22:00,539 --> 01:22:04,260
I did this big analysis and spent many

2166
01:22:02,939 --> 01:22:07,678
days on the farm walking around their

2167
01:22:04,260 --> 01:22:10,260
blocks huge Farm like I got lost I'd

2168
01:22:07,679 --> 01:22:11,039
couldn't find the exits of the farm

2169
01:22:10,260 --> 01:22:12,420
um

2170
01:22:11,039 --> 01:22:15,539
and

2171
01:22:12,420 --> 01:22:17,640
they were their fertility budget was a

2172
01:22:15,539 --> 01:22:19,439
thousand dollars per acre so they were

2173
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:22,159
spending a thousand dollars on organic

2174
01:22:19,439 --> 01:22:25,439
inputs liquid fish hydraulicate gypsum

2175
01:22:22,158 --> 01:22:27,960
microbes like a lot of the stuff that

2176
01:22:25,439 --> 01:22:31,559
we use and I was blown away because a

2177
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:34,020
thousand dollars for Acres a lot and

2178
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:35,940
when I asked him about that the the farm

2179
01:22:34,020 --> 01:22:37,500
manager he just made it really clear

2180
01:22:35,939 --> 01:22:39,299
that when you're growing a high value

2181
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:43,619
crop

2182
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:46,619
you can't skimp on your fertility budget

2183
01:22:43,619 --> 01:22:48,300
and that's not to say have an unlimited

2184
01:22:46,619 --> 01:22:50,158
fertility budget for cannabis production

2185
01:22:48,300 --> 01:22:52,380
I'm not saying that because I am a fan

2186
01:22:50,158 --> 01:22:54,299
of precision and not throwing the

2187
01:22:52,380 --> 01:22:58,260
kitchen sink at it but I also think

2188
01:22:54,300 --> 01:23:00,840
people should forever be thinking about

2189
01:22:58,260 --> 01:23:03,300
fertility and inputs and really focusing

2190
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:05,699
on nutrient management when you're

2191
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:07,260
trying to achieve a high value crop of

2192
01:23:05,698 --> 01:23:09,619
any kind and so I just want to leave it

2193
01:23:07,260 --> 01:23:11,699
on that note because I think that other

2194
01:23:09,619 --> 01:23:14,519
agricultural crops have really figured

2195
01:23:11,698 --> 01:23:16,198
that out and they don't ever skimp on

2196
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:18,960
their fertility budget

2197
01:23:16,198 --> 01:23:21,198
in a premium Market even when prices are

2198
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:21,198
low

2199
01:23:22,079 --> 01:23:25,800
yeah that's a good point I mean for me

2200
01:23:24,119 --> 01:23:28,079
when I think about that I think about my

2201
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:31,560
inputs being high quality in the sense

2202
01:23:28,079 --> 01:23:35,100
of like I'm not going to buy a shoddy

2203
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:36,840
biochar or cheap earthworm castings if I

2204
01:23:35,100 --> 01:23:38,699
can find a higher quality Source I'm

2205
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:40,140
willing to pay a little extra for it to

2206
01:23:38,698 --> 01:23:42,000
know that what I'm getting is going to

2207
01:23:40,140 --> 01:23:44,880
offer me all the benefits of what that

2208
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:46,859
product is because we do see a wide

2209
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:48,359
variety and again it comes back to

2210
01:23:46,859 --> 01:23:50,279
compost like compost is one of those

2211
01:23:48,359 --> 01:23:52,979
things I will not skimp on soil is one

2212
01:23:50,279 --> 01:23:54,539
of those things I will not skimp on if

2213
01:23:52,979 --> 01:23:57,779
I'm looking at two different

2214
01:23:54,539 --> 01:23:59,698
Alfalfa meals uh you know or fish meal

2215
01:23:57,779 --> 01:24:01,679
or something like that I might go with

2216
01:23:59,698 --> 01:24:03,658
the lower price one or gypsum if I can

2217
01:24:01,679 --> 01:24:05,880
find a cheaper version of gypsum and you

2218
01:24:03,658 --> 01:24:08,339
know they're relatively similar then I

2219
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:10,219
have no problem saving money there but

2220
01:24:08,340 --> 01:24:13,460
yeah I mean you

2221
01:24:10,219 --> 01:24:17,460
good soil makes growing fine

2222
01:24:13,460 --> 01:24:19,260
and then use Precision to just to just

2223
01:24:17,460 --> 01:24:21,539
apply only what you need and save the

2224
01:24:19,260 --> 01:24:25,199
money and not applying excessive things

2225
01:24:21,539 --> 01:24:27,238
but apply high quality things because in

2226
01:24:25,198 --> 01:24:29,639
a living soil system or when you're just

2227
01:24:27,238 --> 01:24:31,319
reusing your slow round after round

2228
01:24:29,640 --> 01:24:32,760
um or if you have a topsoil where it's

2229
01:24:31,319 --> 01:24:35,099
not going anywhere and your kids are

2230
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:36,480
going to inherit it the quality does

2231
01:24:35,100 --> 01:24:38,520
matter and the microbial communities

2232
01:24:36,479 --> 01:24:40,919
over time really do respond well to that

2233
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:42,960
so I agree with you

2234
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:44,158
awesome awesome yeah don't fall for the

2235
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:46,198
marketing hype that you see all over

2236
01:24:44,158 --> 01:24:47,599
social media these days uh it drives me

2237
01:24:46,198 --> 01:24:49,799
