1
00:00:01,399 --> 00:00:09,839
so I got to say this surprised me but in

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:13,349
a good way this is our soil mix just on

3
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:16,410
our regular soil mix with a little bit

4
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:19,800
of added molasses to it and I found the

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:22,890
best fungal strand that I found on EMI

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:26,278
samples so far in this batch but in

7
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:29,699
general I'm seeing a lot of strands

8
00:00:26,278 --> 00:00:31,198
starting so when I'm comparing this I'm

9
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:32,700
comparing this to compost which should

10
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,059
naturally be higher in microbial

11
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:38,940
activity then that's soil mix but we're

12
00:00:36,058 --> 00:00:40,820
putting a lot of stuff in our soil a lot

13
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:44,280
of nutrient sources a lot of ingredients

14
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:45,840
as a way of hopefully increasing that

15
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:50,390
microbial activity in our nutrient

16
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,390
cycling so we just zoom in here

17
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:07,590
no they're gonna flagellate see a lot of

18
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:10,170
bacteria cruising around well there's

19
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:12,450
another fungal strand starting up and if

20
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:19,349
we zoom it a little bit further 400

21
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:22,859
times magnification there you can see

22
00:01:19,349 --> 00:01:26,399
what's really going on and that's the

23
00:01:22,859 --> 00:01:27,780
thing about these living microorganisms

24
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,719
is this is really what we're trying to

25
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,420
promote in our soils for increasing

26
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:35,159
nutrient cycling so this is what makes

27
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:40,560
all those amendments that we're adding

28
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:42,140
to the soil available to the plants and

29
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:48,359
you can see there's a lot of good

30
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:52,978
diversity in the different shapes or

31
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:54,569
sizes or morphology as it's called so

32
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:55,859
I'm really happy with the way this

33
00:01:54,569 --> 00:01:59,239
sample looks and again this is just with

34
00:01:55,859 --> 00:01:59,239
a little bit of molasses added
