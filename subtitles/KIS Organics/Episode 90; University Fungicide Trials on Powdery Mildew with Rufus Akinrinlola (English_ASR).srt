currently

54
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:23,680
learning of my phd in plant pathology

55
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,360
that is that's quite a journey so uh

56
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,360
you're you're currently a graduate

57
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,680
research assistant at the university of

58
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,560
tennessee you studied microbiology in

59
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:35,200
nigeria and then nebraska and now

60
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,920
tennessee so you've you're fairly well

61
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:40,079
traveled um i'm just for listeners to

62
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:41,759
understand i know some people are uh

63
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,519
have been have mentioned in the past

64
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:44,639
they're hard of hearing so i may repeat

65
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,039
some things

66
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:48,878
rufus shares just just for the ease of

67
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:50,560
those people but um

68
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:53,840
i really wanted to share

69
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:56,000
rufus's uh his research because it's

70
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,759
it's quite interesting so you

71
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,919
you have a paper that i'm looking at

72
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:02,560
right now that's called hemp fungicide

73
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:04,479
efficacy field trial for leaf spot and

74
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,598
powdery mildew

75
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:08,639
can you

76
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:11,359
talk a little bit about um

77
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:12,799
how you're working with hemp and uh why

78
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,879
you picked

79
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,120
uh you know leaf spot and powdery mildew

80
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:19,199
for your trial

81
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,800
yeah thank you chuck

82
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:24,560
so in tennessee since turn force uh

83
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,599
maybe lies and

84
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,439
in

85
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:30,158
2018

86
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:31,439
and you can see there have been a lot of

87
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:35,519
people

88
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:39,439
interested in going home and um

89
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:42,879
but there is so much uh little uh

90
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:45,840
knowledge and information about

91
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:48,639
uh disease that are facing

92
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,200
since so little research have been

93
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:52,719
you know conducted in that area

94
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:54,719
and in tennessee

95
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:58,479
uh among the most

96
00:03:54,719 --> 00:04:01,919
common disease that our growers

97
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:03,438
reported to the professors on extension

98
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:04,719
especially

99
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:07,438
um

100
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:07,438
please support

101
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:11,919
one of the most important

102
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:15,280
diseases

103
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:16,719
especially uh are fed

104
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,959
in

105
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:25,520
speed you know you can have damage up to

106
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,519
50 to 60 cents of leaf

107
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,879
and when that airport can cause a lot of

108
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,960
trouble i can leave the evolution and

109
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:33,839
illusions on the leaf

110
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:37,519
and

111
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:39,439
if it's not properly managed it could

112
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:41,279
you know affect

113
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:44,160
the quality of the

114
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:45,359
belief including even the

115
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,880
tricon

116
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:52,240
and in home in tennessee the

117
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:54,959
the muslim varieties of henrietta so

118
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:59,680
these are the same for cbd

119
00:04:54,959 --> 00:05:01,359
uh just for clarity between him and

120
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,240
marijuana

121
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,720
uh

122
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,840
in tennessee trump

123
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,520
is

124
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:13,119
this major whereas marana is illegal

125
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:14,319
um to differentiate that

126
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,199
where

127
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:17,599
the

128
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:21,038
the thc content which is the psychology

129
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,240
compound in m is about 0.3

130
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:24,639
uh

131
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,280
so if it's higher than that it is

132
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:30,240
considered to be marijuana so the hemp

133
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:33,599
that we produce is a ham for cbd which

134
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,519
is there which is different for uh

135
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,439
marijuana so

136
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:39,758
yeah going back to

137
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:41,600
why i choose the disease

138
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,240
so there are a lot of trouble with uh

139
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:48,639
helpless part and problem will do

140
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:50,720
but there's no information there's no

141
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:54,400
amount of knowledge on

142
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:56,319
how to what can be used to control it

143
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:57,279
there's no data

144
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,560
and

145
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:00,559
even

146
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,038
products that are labeled

147
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:07,038
they are not labeled for hemp

148
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:09,918
so some relatively new new plan to these

149
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:13,199
states so that's why we picked

150
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:15,519
the research company to look at

151
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:20,080
some products that can be

152
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:23,038
you know can use to manage the disease

153
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:25,038
okay so that makes sense so it uh

154
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:27,599
there just isn't a lot of data out there

155
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:29,360
or research it really doesn't exist yet

156
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,160
this is a new crop

157
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,319
um

158
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,000
pretty much worldwide when it comes to

159
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,759
the academic world there's been some

160
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,720
research i know out of israel and i've

161
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:41,360
seen some work out of israel or italy

162
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,120
as well um and and we're starting to see

163
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,400
research here in the united states on

164
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,038
hemp which

165
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:48,719
as you mentioned is different than um

166
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:52,639
what you know the government calls

167
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:55,039
marijuana what growers call cannabis um

168
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,478
but you're absolutely right there now in

169
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:58,478
terms of

170
00:06:56,478 --> 00:06:59,279
hemp leaf spot and powdery mildew you

171
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:01,598
know

172
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:03,839
that's going to cause leaf necrosis so

173
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:05,360
we're losing the leaf's ability to

174
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:07,359
photosynthesize

175
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,400
um it's stressing the plant which can

176
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,280
lead to

177
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:13,839
greater pest uh or decreased pest

178
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:16,318
resistance um and also like you

179
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:18,879
mentioned just affect the overall vigor

180
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,960
and health of of your crop

181
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:22,319
and which which would affect your yields

182
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:24,159
overall so

183
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:27,120
yeah powdery mildew is one i'm more

184
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:29,120
familiar with here in washington state i

185
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,720
haven't had to deal with hemp leaf spot

186
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,879
or

187
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,039
anything like that

188
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:36,399
myself but i'm aware of what you're

189
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:38,639
saying so

190
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:39,758
so for this trial

191
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,840
um

192
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,879
you guys looked at

193
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:46,638
the research shows let me see here i'm

194
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,400
i'm looking at the paper now and i'll

195
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:51,038
attach it to

196
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:53,758
the uh podcast page for people

197
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:56,000
but you set up a bunch of plots um what

198
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:59,840
why don't you just tell me what um

199
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,839
what did you compare in your research

200
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,639
okay

201
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,399
so uh you looked at four fungicide

202
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,759
products

203
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:09,439
correct yeah

204
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,800
can you uh

205
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:13,519
i'll go ahead and list them because i'm

206
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,079
reading this so you have stargus from

207
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:17,839
marone bioinnovations

208
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:20,318
death guard which is a general

209
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:21,918
hydroponic product

210
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,720
exile

211
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:27,439
from general hydroponics and regalia

212
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,319
from marone bio

213
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:30,240
um

214
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,918
what's uh so

215
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,038
what what did you find now these um

216
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:36,718
it looks like

217
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:39,439
a couple of these are

218
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,120
biological fungicides

219
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,159
oh yeah so

220
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,600
yeah

221
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:47,838
so the question is why do we select

222
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,440
those products right

223
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,959
yeah let's start there that's a that's a

224
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,839
good question

225
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:54,719
yeah that's a very good question

226
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,440
and

227
00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:00,879
as i said earlier there are so

228
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:03,920
little uh products if i if there's this

229
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:05,278
at all that is delivered for him

230
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:06,000
so um

231
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:09,838
in

232
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,278
recently i think about last year or 2019

233
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,800
the epa

234
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:16,958
approved some product about 59 of the of

235
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:18,799
them

236
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:22,559
for him

237
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:26,079
and in tennessee only our photos were

238
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:28,399
approved by the uh can i see

239
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:31,040
uh department of agriculture

240
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:33,278
to be used on hemp

241
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:36,879
that even though they have been you know

242
00:09:33,278 --> 00:09:37,838
approved there was no um

243
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:39,360
data

244
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,120
and also

245
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,959
the

246
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:47,839
uh all the product i see obviously uh

247
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:52,518
they are like

248
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:54,320
they call them reduce risk products are

249
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:56,959
unrealistic

250
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:59,120
and then that means the biological

251
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:03,759
products which

252
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:06,959
potentially are a lot less uh possibly

253
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:06,958
environment or to

254
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:10,319
an iman

255
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:12,958
compared to

256
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:16,160
the the conventional products

257
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:18,958
in in that are used for controlling the

258
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:20,000
such disease on other crops

259
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:23,039
so

260
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,720
basically these products are selected

261
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:28,000
because uh one they have just been

262
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,839
uh

263
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,078
approved by the uh tennessee

264
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:37,040
department of agriculture for use on

265
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:39,278
health and tenancy and secondly you know

266
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:40,719
we are particularly interested in you

267
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:41,679
know testing

268
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,720
uh

269
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:47,599
reduced risk products

270
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,519
which are you know more friendly

271
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,440
to the environment

272
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,039
so reduce so the reason you chose them

273
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,560
are because uh

274
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:56,319
you could you had to choose a product

275
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:59,199
that was approved

276
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,760
by uh the state of tennessee for use on

277
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,680
hemp and then you wanted to go with more

278
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:06,559
reduced risk products so things that

279
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:08,719
were you know organically listed or

280
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:11,599
approved by omri

281
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,600
which makes sense

282
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:16,319
and one thing that you mentioned that i

283
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,639
think is really important is is

284
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,320
that there is no data on these products

285
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:22,399
from a university and

286
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,879
just because a product is approved does

287
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:27,200
not mean it has good efficacy

288
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:29,360
so uh i think that's that's a really

289
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,440
important point for growers to think

290
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,800
about when they're choosing products to

291
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,560
apply because there's a lot of good

292
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:38,078
sales information around these products

293
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:40,559
but not a not a lot of research

294
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:42,399
now why not an oil-based product like so

295
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:45,119
the first thing i think of would be

296
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,879
something like um self oil x which is a

297
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:50,399
mineral oil based

298
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:52,320
product that's omri listed um

299
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,720
but it's not necessary i don't know if

300
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,720
it's been approved in tennessee for that

301
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,759
specific use

302
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,440
um

303
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:01,679
but but wouldn't pretty much any

304
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,320
oil-based product kill

305
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:04,319
a fungus

306
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:10,800
oh you say uh with any product skill

307
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,480
fungus is awkward uh in any like oil

308
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:14,000
based because it looks like you went

309
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,920
with um

310
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,639
you know biological and then uh

311
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:23,199
the regalia is a not weed extract and

312
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:25,680
then the exile is the potassium salts of

313
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,278
fatty acids

314
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:28,799
um

315
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:30,480
is there a reason you didn't choose an

316
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:32,399
oil-based product

317
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,639
in your trial

318
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,720
or was there just not available

319
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,440
on the market

320
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,360
yeah

321
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:44,639
yeah another another another criteria we

322
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,800
we use also to say let

323
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:49,759
uh data

324
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:54,000
uh me select that product to

325
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:55,919
to be tested is we also look at

326
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,078
some other states

327
00:12:55,919 --> 00:13:00,879
what are the products that have been you

328
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:02,399
know tested by other scientists

329
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:05,120
in other states

330
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:08,240
so and when we looked at those are the

331
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:11,200
ones that we found that that from united

332
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:13,440
states has been tested and when when

333
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:17,440
scientists are interested in some

334
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:20,959
products in other states it shows that

335
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,800
every green light that such products may

336
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:23,838
be effective

337
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:26,559
you know

338
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:30,320
so the way you look online

339
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:33,199
there is no any data uh i mean you can

340
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:35,920
scientific uh thank you

341
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,200
like a plant disease management report

342
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:40,639
uh if you

343
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:43,360
look at that the superior basis you find

344
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,399
uh information on

345
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,959
uh

346
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:49,120
a particular product in the nearby you

347
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:52,078
know states

348
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:55,198
or seats within the same region you can

349
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:58,319
you know have some green lights weather

350
00:13:55,198 --> 00:14:00,000
testing because ultimately we although

351
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,199
we want

352
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,278
results

353
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:08,000
that ultimately also we also want to be

354
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:09,198
able to recommend products to our

355
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,120
growers

356
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:12,879
and we want something that would be

357
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,399
effective for them

358
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:16,000
so

359
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,440
when we look at

360
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,480
the the

361
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:22,720
uh scientific literatures from other

362
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,879
states these are the ones that we see

363
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,440
okay maybe it has infected little ones

364
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:29,360
in other states and

365
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,480
it shows some potential

366
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,159
so

367
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,600
that's why we

368
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:37,360
we

369
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:39,680
we let us so not necessarily because

370
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:44,639
the other ones

371
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:44,638
uh that maybe all these periods are not

372
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:51,120
any

373
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:53,919
uh initial information that can

374
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:59,399
uh which we used to qualify as a

375
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:59,399
criteria you know for testing uh

376
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,278
yeah and

377
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:05,679
to be fair as a scientist i mean you

378
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:07,919
want to test everything you want to do

379
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:09,919
all this research but at the end of the

380
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:11,599
day you have to pick

381
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:13,838
something you have to start somewhere

382
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,639
and you know you can't

383
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:18,639
you can't test 20 products or your

384
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:21,198
statistical significance would be too

385
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:23,600
low so

386
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:25,278
yeah you know if you want to test every

387
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,399
product in fact

388
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:30,639
you you're gonna have a number of

389
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:33,360
numerous of them to test because there

390
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:36,159
are a lot of products there a lot of

391
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,519
products and so you have to have some

392
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:39,679
criteria

393
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,519
to go but a lot of

394
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:43,439
um all those further if you end up

395
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:46,959
testing one that does not mean you don't

396
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:49,440
have like good information i mean uh who

397
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:52,000
the efficacy is from me so at the end of

398
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,199
day you want to a twitter that's gonna

399
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,078
actually have

400
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:57,838
some good advocacy so that your growers

401
00:15:56,078 --> 00:16:02,078
that you are serving as an extension

402
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:05,199
professor my my pr dr anthony

403
00:16:02,078 --> 00:16:06,719
uh here is an education especially for

404
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:09,198
specialty crop

405
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:12,320
and and at the end of the day he

406
00:16:09,198 --> 00:16:16,319
received calls from growers to get um

407
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:17,839
you know to give them recommendations on

408
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,839
something like this

409
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:23,759
so at the end of day we want to be able

410
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:27,120
to have like positive recommendations

411
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:29,680
something that can you know we can

412
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:33,198
actually say oh this is effective in

413
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:34,799
tennessee and you can use it

414
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:36,479
so you want you want to find something

415
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:38,479
that will be effective that you can

416
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,839
recommend to growers and that you know

417
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,920
works

418
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:44,079
it doesn't matter if it works in alaska

419
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:45,838
or in europe it matters if it works in

420
00:16:44,078 --> 00:16:47,278
tennessee because those are the growers

421
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,199
that you work with

422
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:52,000
that makes sense so

423
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:54,799
you set up this experimental design and

424
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,759
um these plots

425
00:16:54,799 --> 00:17:00,078
you were uh hand watering

426
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:02,399
uh two to three times per week and

427
00:17:00,078 --> 00:17:06,558
weeding with mechanical cultivation

428
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:07,919
and um once you had it looks like i'm

429
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:10,558
reading your

430
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:12,000
your report here um leaf spot severity

431
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:14,798
around two percent you started the

432
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:18,160
fungicide applications and repeated

433
00:17:14,798 --> 00:17:20,480
seven times at ten day intervals

434
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:23,120
and then you did disease ratings to

435
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:25,439
measure the severity of the disease um

436
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:27,119
and the the amount of disease

437
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,960
symptoms and instances you were seeing

438
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:32,479
on the leaf so

439
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:35,200
all of that sounds sounds great uh let's

440
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:37,759
let's just dive into the results what

441
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:40,640
what did you find with uh these four

442
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:43,279
products compared to your control

443
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:46,000
as far as reduction let's start with

444
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:47,038
leaf spot

445
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,679
yeah

446
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:51,919
as you probably see from the the results

447
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,360
section this resource table that's

448
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:53,740
prepared

449
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:54,959
uh

450
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:58,240
[Music]

451
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:00,079
most of the products have some level of

452
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,960
efficiency

453
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,159
uh

454
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,759
we have

455
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,240
okay let me

456
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:09,599
describe the treatment

457
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:12,798
in total we have a test treatment

458
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:15,359
and one of the treatment is the positive

459
00:18:12,798 --> 00:18:18,558
control the positive control means

460
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:21,359
we know that this is effective it can

461
00:18:18,558 --> 00:18:24,720
control this pathogen

462
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:28,079
and that is the quarters and even though

463
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:31,360
it's not labeled for tempting tendency

464
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:32,960
uh we we use that as our check you know

465
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:34,479
you can say that

466
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,880
when something work we'll be able to

467
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:39,440
control you

468
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,720
we're able to control it with our

469
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,038
treatment

470
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:46,558
then we have this another treatment we

471
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:47,679
have the untreated untreated treatment

472
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:50,000
which is

473
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:52,080
it means it is not treated with anything

474
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,640
that means the disease is there usually

475
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:57,839
continue to increase it was not

476
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:59,038
uh they're retaining then the four other

477
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:00,879
treatments

478
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:04,960
are

479
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:08,799
tested products which include the stegos

480
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:11,759
the regalia the dev guide and the exact

481
00:19:08,798 --> 00:19:13,519
and you can see from the

482
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:14,319
result table

483
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:15,038
that

484
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:18,159
the

485
00:19:15,038 --> 00:19:19,279
the most effective form among among the

486
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,480
four

487
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:21,918
uh

488
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,599
products

489
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,679
is the

490
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:29,199
regalia

491
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:31,759
and regalia has

492
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,759
moderates

493
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:37,038
relatively higher efficiency efficiency

494
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:40,319
compared to the

495
00:19:37,038 --> 00:19:42,000
other uh two products

496
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:44,960
and if you can see

497
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:48,079
we look at the to summarize the affected

498
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:51,519
efficacy we look at the

499
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:53,839
uh you look at the disease in this table

500
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:55,359
this descendants means the summary of

501
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:57,519
the

502
00:19:55,359 --> 00:20:00,399
uh indents

503
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:01,359
and this the summary of the incidence

504
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:06,000
and the

505
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:07,279
severity so the incidence measured

506
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,159
out of

507
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:10,158
let's say out of

508
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,038
the old plant

509
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:15,599
how

510
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:17,119
what is the proportion of the plant has

511
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:20,079
disease

512
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:22,959
for instance if the if the plant has

513
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:24,480
five branches is it all the branch that

514
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,919
has at least

515
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:30,798
a center of least what or just one of

516
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:33,440
the the branch or all of the branch so

517
00:20:30,798 --> 00:20:36,558
that is in incidence

518
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,519
then the severity we look at the leaf

519
00:20:36,558 --> 00:20:41,119
you know

520
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:43,119
on each leaf on of the plant

521
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:45,599
how many

522
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:48,798
uh parts or what proportion or

523
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:51,199
percentage of that leaf has the disease

524
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:55,279
so when we take the data

525
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:58,400
both incidence and severity together we

526
00:20:55,279 --> 00:21:01,678
we multiply that and divide by hundreds

527
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:04,080
so to determine our disease index so

528
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:06,720
that is summary data

529
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:08,879
so if you look at the disease

530
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,919
uh index table

531
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,840
for

532
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:15,038
regalia

533
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:15,759
you will see that our value

534
00:21:15,038 --> 00:21:17,599
in

535
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:19,599
during our

536
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:20,719
during our

537
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:23,519
um

538
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:26,240
three days data collection date

539
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:27,839
you will see that it's always

540
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,798
uh

541
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:31,759
lower than the on on

542
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:34,400
than the

543
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:37,200
untreated can you see that

544
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,960
uh the on twitter has like for instance

545
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,640
during the first date the on twitter has

546
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:44,000
like a level

547
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:45,919
11 disease index why do they treat uh

548
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,319
regalia has six

549
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:50,480
and if you look at the final dates

550
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:51,759
regalia has um

551
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,599
16

552
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:54,960
and the on twitter has

553
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:55,839
24.

554
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,480
so

555
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:59,480
that shows that

556
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:04,319
is

557
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:06,000
controlling disease compared

558
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:08,558
to the untreated

559
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,720
again if you look at the area under

560
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:14,319
disease progress

561
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:17,038
that is also known as disease intensity

562
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:19,839
across the tire if we want to summarize

563
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:23,279
disease across the date

564
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:25,519
or during the period of the trial

565
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:27,359
so we also use that term also to

566
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:29,918
describe the disease

567
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:31,199
so you also look at the untreated which

568
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:33,919
is our

569
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,200
uh negative control you see that the

570
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:39,038
data

571
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:41,679
is higher than regalia regalia has lower

572
00:22:39,038 --> 00:22:44,960
disease and disease

573
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:47,600
area under disease progress

574
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:49,400
compared to uh the untreated the

575
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:50,959
entrepreneur has 3

576
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,720
643

577
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,919
regalia has only

578
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,440
serious

579
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:57,919
80

580
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,759
one also if you look at the letter the

581
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:02,240
letter

582
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:03,359
after the the the

583
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,159
the value

584
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:09,199
regalia has letter b

585
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:12,000
whereas the untreated has letter a that

586
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,840
shows that this the letter is different

587
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,599
so when the letter is different it shows

588
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:18,079
that the values

589
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:20,558
or the efficacy of that treatment is

590
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:21,519
different from the untreated

591
00:23:20,558 --> 00:23:23,759
so

592
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:24,879
yeah you can see that then

593
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:28,319
uh

594
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:30,480
when i'll go to the next effective one

595
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:34,839
is staggers

596
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,839
uh we can see that staggers

597
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:42,798
okay no exile as i as i

598
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:44,079
then followed by staggers

599
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:45,679
so for the

600
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:48,960
uh least thoughts

601
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:51,600
that regalia if you look at um

602
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:54,319
if you look at uh devgatt

603
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:56,879
you can see that the the number

604
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:57,759
for the dev guard is high

605
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,159
is

606
00:23:57,759 --> 00:24:03,200
almost is similar not almost it's

607
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:05,360
similar to the data or on twitter's

608
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,880
control and that means

609
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:09,839
um

610
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,600
the plants that are treated with delgad

611
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:13,038
is not different

612
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:14,798
i mean the disease

613
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:16,158
not

614
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:18,720
significant

615
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:20,960
exactly

616
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,120
yeah i see what you're saying so

617
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:26,240
so so to summarize what you're saying is

618
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:28,719
between the untreated and death guard

619
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,679
when it came to leaf spot uh there was

620
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,240
no

621
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:34,080
uh statistically significant difference

622
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,079
you had potentially a two percent

623
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:38,399
reduction but your standard deviation

624
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:39,199
was probably greater than that yeah i

625
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:43,120
guess

626
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:44,880
um yeah and then and then you had exile

627
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:48,639
with 44

628
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:51,360
disease reduction stargus with 43

629
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:53,120
and regalia showing 41 so they all

630
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:54,879
that's why they have the b after the

631
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:56,399
disease intensity so

632
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,440
fairly moderate

633
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,400
um

634
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:02,640
disease reduction now one question i i

635
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:06,320
had in my head while i was i was

636
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:08,960
listening to this was did you spray uh

637
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:11,839
the the contr the untreated crop with

638
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:14,319
water as a way of removing that as a

639
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:15,519
variable in comparison to these other

640
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:17,599
treatments

641
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:21,440
like could just the application of water

642
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:23,839
reduce the amount the uh fungus

643
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,840
growth

644
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:30,720
um no that's a good question we did not

645
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:34,320
spray with water

646
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:35,519
because we were this study is a fit

647
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:36,879
study

648
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:39,839
if it was

649
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:42,480
uh if it were a growing study

650
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:43,839
where there is no rainfall

651
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,038
you know we

652
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:48,399
we

653
00:25:45,038 --> 00:25:51,599
we normally you know spray with water

654
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:53,038
but the free trial when you spray your

655
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:55,119
products

656
00:25:53,038 --> 00:25:57,519
and even though you do not spread the

657
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:58,399
untreated with water

658
00:25:57,519 --> 00:26:01,359
you know

659
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:03,759
rain is always falling and

660
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:04,719
and so the same

661
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:08,400
rain

662
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:11,200
rain water can fall on the plants and

663
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,919
have the same effect on the heat

664
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,440
so

665
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:16,799
so we do not stray with water and

666
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,840
and i

667
00:26:16,798 --> 00:26:21,759
that does not really have any effects on

668
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:23,839
the treatment

669
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:25,919
okay okay i was curious because i've

670
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:28,158
heard that even water with powdery

671
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:30,240
mildew i don't know what leaf spot can

672
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:32,720
help suppress powdery mildew but

673
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,480
obviously it also increases

674
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,960
the humidity on the leaf surface and

675
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:40,880
could lead to greater

676
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:42,640
powdery mildew uh grow yeah too so

677
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,480
i was just curious about that so so

678
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,240
you're saying with the rainfall and

679
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,759
everything else you guys chose not to

680
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,519
because you're you want your control to

681
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:50,400
be most similar to what a grower would

682
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:52,879
do

683
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,600
in tennessee which is

684
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,400
yeah

685
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:57,839
will be an application okay um

686
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,240
one other question i had with the

687
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:03,918
microbial products that you applied did

688
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:05,038
you did you do any microbial testing to

689
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:07,440
see

690
00:27:05,038 --> 00:27:09,519
um if the microbes were present in the

691
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,919
concentrations that were claimed on the

692
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:11,918
labels

693
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:16,159
oh and

694
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:20,158
i think okay we did not test that

695
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:20,960
that alone is another yeah another story

696
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,679
to

697
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:26,640
to do that's a good question we we were

698
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:28,640
not you know planning towards direction

699
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:31,278
that direction we just want to test it

700
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:33,679
in the face to see okay

701
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:36,319
and to be clear i'm not bringing these

702
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:37,919
things up to criticize your work in the

703
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:40,879
least bit because

704
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:43,840
uh there's always there it's impossible

705
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:45,840
to look at every you know every variable

706
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:48,558
but it's important when evaluating a

707
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:50,240
study to look to ask questions

708
00:27:48,558 --> 00:27:51,839
you know to think about what the

709
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,240
implications

710
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:55,439
you can draw from the data so one thing

711
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,120
you could say is well maybe those

712
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,640
bottles weren't as viable because they

713
00:27:57,119 --> 00:28:02,000
had been sitting on a shelf for a long

714
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:04,559
time um so it may be worth going back at

715
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,960
some point as a separate researcher and

716
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:09,200
looking at that but that doesn't yeah

717
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,278
it doesn't invalidate your results at

718
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,960
all so i just i want to clarify that for

719
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:14,480
listeners that i'm not

720
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,679
i'm certainly not criticizing your

721
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,399
research

722
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:20,798
you get you give us a very good research

723
00:28:18,398 --> 00:28:23,599
topic to to to

724
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:26,798
to to think on and that's a very good

725
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:28,000
one you know that would be another maybe

726
00:28:26,798 --> 00:28:28,798
masters

727
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,200
uh

728
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:34,798
project well we should talk because um

729
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,960
i work with a

730
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:40,319
a gentleman our research scientist who i

731
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,840
work with dr ben higgins

732
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:43,599
he and i are always

733
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:46,319
coming up with new

734
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:48,558
new research we would love to see around

735
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:52,158
cannabis and hemp so i'd love to talk to

736
00:28:48,558 --> 00:28:52,158
stay in touch and talk about this but

737
00:28:52,558 --> 00:28:56,480
i'm glad to see more of this research is

738
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,919
coming out so that's that's the most

739
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,480
important thing is that we're starting

740
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:02,720
to get a body of knowledge that we can

741
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,000
begin to learn more about this crop

742
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,360
because

743
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,398
none of the research we're seeing right

744
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:10,479
now is definitive it's just it's just to

745
00:29:08,398 --> 00:29:12,879
start pointing us in a direction to say

746
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,759
hey this is worth looking at you know so

747
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,799
yeah

748
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:18,720
and that's where we have to start um

749
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:21,359
let's let's talk about powder and mildew

750
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,880
so your results with

751
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:25,038
uh and this was what made me think of

752
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,960
the water thing is is the comparison of

753
00:29:25,038 --> 00:29:28,960
the leaf spot versus powdery mildew

754
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,200
results because uh let's just start with

755
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,960
def guard you're you're you got no

756
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,360
significant reduction

757
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,038
um in disease intensity with def guard

758
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:40,119
on leaf spot but how about with powder

759
00:29:37,038 --> 00:29:40,119
and mildew

760
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,799
yeah the problem of the uh we can see

761
00:29:43,278 --> 00:29:48,398
that um

762
00:29:44,798 --> 00:29:49,918
uh it's like uh if you look at devga and

763
00:29:48,398 --> 00:29:51,918
status

764
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:55,200
they're like um

765
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:56,720
uh they walk in an inverse inverse

766
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:00,319
inverse way

767
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:01,679
the struggles control disease on

768
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:03,119
uh

769
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:03,930
this spot

770
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:06,000
but um

771
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:07,919
[Music]

772
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,759
uh powder will module

773
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:13,038
uh it was

774
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:15,919
relatively ineffective but that guy

775
00:30:13,038 --> 00:30:16,879
became effective in controlling powder

776
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:18,720
mode

777
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:21,760
even though it was not

778
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:24,480
you know effective in controlling um

779
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:26,000
it was interesting when we saw the the

780
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:29,440
result

781
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,839
so we can see um that guy control about

782
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,600
52 percent disease control compared to

783
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:35,439
the control

784
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:36,558
um

785
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,080
um

786
00:30:36,558 --> 00:30:39,678
uh

787
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:43,119
the sagas

788
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:44,320
uh only control less than

789
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:46,558
you know

790
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:48,639
very low disease

791
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:51,119
so the the the stargas and death guard

792
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:53,200
kind of switched ethicism

793
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:55,119
when it came to leaf spot and powdery

794
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:58,080
mildew so def guard

795
00:30:55,119 --> 00:31:01,359
not effective against leaf spot 52

796
00:30:58,079 --> 00:31:04,240
effective against powdery mildew stargas

797
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:05,678
43 effective against leaf spot which was

798
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,480
one of your higher

799
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:10,880
marks and yet only 20 against powdery

800
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,319
mildew so very not really effective at

801
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,880
all um

802
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:17,599
but then your other two products exile

803
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:19,200
and regalia and yeah

804
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:22,000
i have to go back here because i'm not

805
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:25,440
familiar um i know regalia is a not

806
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,558
wheat extract is exile a microbial or is

807
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,840
that the

808
00:31:26,558 --> 00:31:32,480
potassium salts of fatty acids yeah it's

809
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:35,839
potassium salts sorts of

810
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:37,519
fatty acids that's exact and regalia is

811
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:40,158
the extracts of

812
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:41,519
these plants and root nuts

813
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:44,880
and

814
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:48,720
yeah regalia has been very effective

815
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:51,600
generally on both disease as you can see

816
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:54,159
yes you know and exactly it's more

817
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:56,879
effective on the padu module

818
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:58,480
so you basically with regalia

819
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:01,200
saw

820
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,640
no powdery mildew i mean 99

821
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,000
disease reduction

822
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,320
so it was it was

823
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,640
barely you were barely able to find it

824
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:12,240
that's amazing that you can't get better

825
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:13,600
data than that on efficacy um

826
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,519
that's quite good

827
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:17,359
so um um

828
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:19,919
oh go ahead um again

829
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:22,240
i do want to point the fact that in

830
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:23,600
steve's study

831
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,120
uh

832
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:28,480
powder module

833
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:31,518
trial is always compared to indoor

834
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:33,200
indoor trial now powder mildew is always

835
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:34,399
relatively

836
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,880
um

837
00:32:34,398 --> 00:32:39,199
compared to in greenhouse

838
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:44,159
it's relatively low compared to the

839
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:45,440
prior is always very low compared to to

840
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:46,559
indoor

841
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,278
so

842
00:32:46,558 --> 00:32:50,558
one of the reasons why you have that

843
00:32:49,278 --> 00:32:53,759
level of

844
00:32:50,558 --> 00:32:56,639
highly control

845
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:58,079
may be the fact that disease prior

846
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,278
you know uh

847
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:01,359
in in

848
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:04,079
outside is is

849
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:06,398
low because the as you said earlier

850
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:07,839
rainfall actually can affect the powder

851
00:33:06,398 --> 00:33:10,239
modulu prayer

852
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:13,119
you know when there is water it can you

853
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,558
know reduce the the building of a spores

854
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:17,359
on the leaf

855
00:33:14,558 --> 00:33:20,398
and then if you now put an effective

856
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:23,199
product it's easily uh control the

857
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:27,439
disease so that's one of the strengths

858
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:29,200
of the regalia the fact that and also

859
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,679
you know i have other

860
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:34,159
i've done several other tests in the

861
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:36,559
greenhouse and we are hoping to push out

862
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:40,320
another uh publication

863
00:33:36,558 --> 00:33:43,359
and by the end of this year uh great for

864
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:44,798
for a ton of greyhounds uh trials and we

865
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:46,079
have tested some

866
00:33:44,798 --> 00:33:48,398
new products

867
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:50,000
and i'm deciding about that so you're

868
00:33:48,398 --> 00:33:52,639
gonna see some

869
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,919
results as well wonderful i would i

870
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,559
would love to see that when that's

871
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:59,038
available um so so you're you're

872
00:33:56,558 --> 00:34:01,038
speculating that um

873
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:02,319
this the spore pressure from powdery

874
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:04,158
mildew

875
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:07,278
is lower

876
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:10,720
outdoors than indoors and the rainfall

877
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:14,239
events help wash away or don't allow the

878
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:16,878
the pm to get as an effective of a

879
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:20,559
hold on the leaf itself

880
00:34:16,878 --> 00:34:22,639
um yeah is that what you're saying yeah

881
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:25,599
yeah you know i've worked both in both

882
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:28,878
systems so i've seen powder module prior

883
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:31,119
uh uh in both system and i've seen you

884
00:34:28,878 --> 00:34:33,039
know how the difference the difference

885
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:35,119
that you know in the greenhouse you have

886
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:36,239
the humidity and

887
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:38,800
and

888
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:41,439
you know warm temperature grows the

889
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:44,639
control in the control environment which

890
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:45,838
is very conducive for powder models

891
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,720
to develop

892
00:34:45,838 --> 00:34:49,838
and

893
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:52,719
there's no that scenario or occasional

894
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:53,918
info that washes the weather the plant

895
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:56,480
there's no

896
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:59,118
the eye temperature that you know you

897
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,719
know very high temperature during the

898
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:02,480
summer that can

899
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:03,598
you know so

900
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,960
uh

901
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:08,880
i see as i said in the in the greenhouse

902
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:11,199
it's always if

903
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:13,119
i can share some of the pictures i have

904
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:16,480
if you look at the picture of the

905
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:18,960
greenhouse infestable model and they

906
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:21,119
feed infested you're going to see very

907
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:23,199
very different you know a very good

908
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:25,838
difference you can get

909
00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:27,679
oh so they they physically display

910
00:35:25,838 --> 00:35:29,759
powdery mildew the same species of

911
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:31,919
powdery mildew will physically display

912
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:34,720
differently in a greenhouse leaf than an

913
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:36,800
outdoor leaf is what you're saying

914
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:39,519
that's a good question that you you

915
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,519
raise now

916
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:43,598
when you were talking my thought was i

917
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:46,000
wonder if we could if we could do

918
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:48,720
targeted heat treatments

919
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,800
or targeted humidity treatments similar

920
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:53,519
to what you might experience outdoors as

921
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:55,680
a way of lowering spore pressure in a

922
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:57,519
controlled environment i mean there's so

923
00:35:55,679 --> 00:36:00,639
many there's so many different ways to

924
00:35:57,519 --> 00:36:03,440
approach this yeah very good that's a

925
00:36:00,639 --> 00:36:04,799
very good in our greyhound study we look

926
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,639
at the

927
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,400
the

928
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:10,719
we look at we

929
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:13,440
we have been able to identify the

930
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:16,319
species that caused the

931
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:20,079
igneous powder model

932
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:21,599
and but we did not

933
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:23,599
look at them

934
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:25,280
even though generally speaking in

935
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:28,480
thailand so we know that gonover my

936
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:30,720
scene gonna gonna know my series for the

937
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:34,000
species that caused the parliament we

938
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:34,799
cannot say that we have not uh looked at

939
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:39,119
the

940
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:39,119
species itself whether is uh

941
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,519
there are different

942
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,599
species

943
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:45,440
species that cause them

944
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:48,079
the problem on the bed we've not been

945
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,880
able to identify for the

946
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:49,839
grain

947
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,119
for the

948
00:36:49,838 --> 00:36:52,400
feed

949
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:54,640
and

950
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,639
okay

951
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,960
so you're what you're saying is that you

952
00:36:57,358 --> 00:37:02,559
identified the species for the

953
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:04,240
greenhouse which is golovino mices

954
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:05,679
but um

955
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:06,479
actually

956
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:09,598
we

957
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:12,079
id the identification goal of enormous

958
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:14,800
ambrosiae which is the most one of the

959
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:17,599
most common uh powder module pathogen in

960
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:20,480
this environment okay okay

961
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:22,559
but just for listeners uh powdery mildew

962
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:24,800
is sort of a catch-all term for numerous

963
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:27,679
species that produce a white powdery

964
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:29,680
substance on a leaf surface so

965
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:32,078
and they don't all cross between plant

966
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:34,000
to plant so you could have two different

967
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:36,079
species of plants and one could be

968
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:39,760
infected and the other one could not uh

969
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:41,760
just based on that particular species of

970
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:44,160
powdery mildew and what plants it can

971
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,359
infect so

972
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:46,960
um

973
00:37:45,358 --> 00:37:51,279
well well getting back to your research

974
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:53,760
here so so you found um neither neither

975
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,640
of the biological products interestingly

976
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:58,160
enough

977
00:37:54,639 --> 00:38:01,519
was able to provide moderate efficacy

978
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:05,358
across leaf spot and powdery mildew

979
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:06,960
yeah but both of the uh non-biologicals

980
00:38:05,358 --> 00:38:09,440
so you had an extract and then the

981
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:12,159
potassium

982
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:14,240
salts of fatty acids uh showed good

983
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:16,799
efficacy across leaf spot and powdery

984
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:19,118
mildew um yeah

985
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:21,760
did you find any degradation of

986
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:23,680
trichomes or or anything that affected

987
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:26,400
the final product with any of these

988
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:26,399
applications

989
00:38:27,199 --> 00:38:30,480
okay so the question is

990
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:34,319
is

991
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:37,280
does any of the treatment affect

992
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:40,079
the trichome or is that what you mean

993
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:43,519
yeah the quality of the final product so

994
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:45,119
uh obviously as a grower you know if i'm

995
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:47,838
you know you try to avoid spraying

996
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:49,519
things as we move into flour now

997
00:38:47,838 --> 00:38:51,358
sometimes you have to but that can

998
00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:54,400
affect the quality

999
00:38:51,358 --> 00:38:56,960
um whether that's the the terpenes or

1000
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,920
the tricho development of the product

1001
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,440
itself

1002
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,920
the crop

1003
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:03,119
did you find any differences based on

1004
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,639
these

1005
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:06,880
these treatments

1006
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:10,000
as to the final

1007
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:13,039
uh you know hemp quality

1008
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,599
that's that's a very good question um

1009
00:39:13,039 --> 00:39:19,199
seriously i've been thinking about

1010
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:23,119
uh one direction as we did test

1011
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:24,480
uh the the amount you know the quantity

1012
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:26,480
we did the

1013
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,760
quantitative analysis

1014
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:30,320
of the

1015
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:33,040
cbd which is the you know i said earlier

1016
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:36,559
that most of the hand that we tested are

1017
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:39,519
for cbd production so we did third is

1018
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:40,480
that our treatment affects the quantity

1019
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:41,199
of

1020
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:44,719
the

1021
00:39:41,199 --> 00:39:45,519
uh cbd content initial

1022
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:46,639
uh

1023
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:49,119
okay and

1024
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:51,440
and we did not find any difference there

1025
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:54,000
was no no any difference but as we are

1026
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:57,760
talking now are you going to think about

1027
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,920
the chemical analysis maybe that that

1028
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:02,000
may be very good because it talks about

1029
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:04,400
degradation and

1030
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,639
you know he also is a very good point it

1031
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:08,838
may be nice to look at

1032
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:12,639
you know the

1033
00:40:08,838 --> 00:40:15,440
the uh qualitative in term of uh

1034
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:16,960
uh chemical analysis of the

1035
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:20,400
of the

1036
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:22,559
uh the products i mean the the cbds

1037
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:26,400
whether there is a contaminant or

1038
00:40:22,559 --> 00:40:28,318
whether is that normally degradation or

1039
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,400
so maybe that that may be a very good

1040
00:40:28,318 --> 00:40:32,239
thing to test where we've not we've not

1041
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,559
looked at that

1042
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:37,759
yeah one concern would be if a product

1043
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:39,119
contained levels of heavy metals um

1044
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:41,599
then that would that would be something

1045
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:42,880
that you could be potentially risking

1046
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:44,640
with your crop

1047
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,480
even though these products

1048
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:49,598
by nature of being registered as a

1049
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:52,000
fertilizer or a pesticide i'm not sure

1050
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:53,280
with pesticides but i'm pretty sure that

1051
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,119
that's the same case i know with

1052
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:57,200
fertilizers you have to get tested for

1053
00:40:55,119 --> 00:41:00,480
heavy metal analysis but that would be

1054
00:40:57,199 --> 00:41:02,559
something to look at but um so you did

1055
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:05,199
you didn't find any

1056
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:09,119
statistically significant results when

1057
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:11,598
you measured the cbd the cannabinoids

1058
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:12,640
across all four treatments did you see

1059
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:14,720
any

1060
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:17,598
biomass differences so they were the

1061
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:19,439
yields i would assume that the regalia

1062
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:21,359
plot would have higher yields because

1063
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:23,119
you had a greater amount of disease

1064
00:41:21,358 --> 00:41:24,639
reduction so the plants were probably

1065
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:25,680
healthier

1066
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:27,920
did you

1067
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:29,440
find that or what were the results there

1068
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,200
because i don't see them here in the in

1069
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,159
the paper itself

1070
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:34,960
yeah

1071
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:35,838
we look at the biomass

1072
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,880
um

1073
00:41:35,838 --> 00:41:42,318
you know obviously we saw that you know

1074
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:45,519
those like uh more highly effective

1075
00:41:42,318 --> 00:41:48,318
treatment has like increased

1076
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:50,880
environments but statistically

1077
00:41:48,318 --> 00:41:54,079
again they were not different

1078
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:56,800
as you can see obviously i mean visually

1079
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:57,920
you can see that the numbering is is

1080
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:00,800
higher

1081
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:04,159
greater than the known untreated

1082
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:06,560
and when we do the analysis uh you know

1083
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:07,838
static statistical analysis that was

1084
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:09,838
most significantly different

1085
00:42:07,838 --> 00:42:11,599
statistically different

1086
00:42:09,838 --> 00:42:12,880
so okay that's

1087
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:14,160
let me make sure i understand this

1088
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:16,079
because i think this is an important

1089
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:19,279
point so so you're saying that even

1090
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:21,039
though the biomass visually was greater

1091
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,960
in the treatment plots than the

1092
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:25,358
untreated

1093
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:27,920
based when you did the the statistical

1094
00:42:25,358 --> 00:42:29,759
analysis when you did the the math on it

1095
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,119
there it was not statistically

1096
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,960
significant

1097
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:34,880
yielding yes

1098
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:37,039
yeah that's that's a huge point i just

1099
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,720
want to emphasize because that's really

1100
00:42:37,039 --> 00:42:39,920
interesting because

1101
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:42,318
if

1102
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:44,639
if that were to play out as as more

1103
00:42:42,318 --> 00:42:46,800
research becomes available

1104
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:48,480
you know these your next table here

1105
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,599
table two shows the cost of these

1106
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:52,000
products

1107
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:55,280
um yeah you know you're anywhere from

1108
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:58,079
500 to over 1700

1109
00:42:55,280 --> 00:43:00,319
per acre across the season yeah

1110
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:01,839
well in theory that's a waste of money

1111
00:43:00,318 --> 00:43:04,318
if uh

1112
00:43:01,838 --> 00:43:05,759
we're not getting biomass

1113
00:43:04,318 --> 00:43:07,599
increases

1114
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:09,119
uh yield increases

1115
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:10,480
right

1116
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:12,880
yeah yeah

1117
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:15,519
it's true um

1118
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:17,119
one question that we always talked about

1119
00:43:15,519 --> 00:43:17,920
the game is

1120
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:20,240
uh

1121
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:22,880
what level are statistically

1122
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:25,759
significant or different is it is

1123
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:27,680
financially or economically

1124
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:29,520
significance

1125
00:43:27,679 --> 00:43:32,639
you know you know what level of

1126
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:33,719
statistics statistical is different or

1127
00:43:32,639 --> 00:43:36,559
is is

1128
00:43:33,719 --> 00:43:40,318
economically significant

1129
00:43:36,559 --> 00:43:41,519
you know in ipm one objective of ipm is

1130
00:43:40,318 --> 00:43:43,759
to

1131
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:45,440
is to reduce disease

1132
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:48,880
so below

1133
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:51,440
our economic threshold yes and that is a

1134
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:53,599
threshold that our injury threshold we

1135
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:55,920
call it economic injury session that's a

1136
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:58,960
stress show that it's gonna cause

1137
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:00,400
economical uh damage

1138
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,559
so

1139
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:06,000
when you apply your product you may be

1140
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:07,599
able to you know at the end of the the

1141
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,719
uh the

1142
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:11,680
be able to know that if this product

1143
00:44:10,719 --> 00:44:13,838
uh

1144
00:44:11,679 --> 00:44:16,639
even though it control may be little

1145
00:44:13,838 --> 00:44:19,440
disease does that little disease

1146
00:44:16,639 --> 00:44:22,000
uh fed my uh

1147
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:23,440
uh economy you know does he does he

1148
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,239
bring some

1149
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,440
uh

1150
00:44:24,239 --> 00:44:28,000
profit

1151
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:30,639
yeah so these are the questions that are

1152
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,400
also that needs to be considered

1153
00:44:30,639 --> 00:44:34,639
that's that's a really really good point

1154
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:36,880
rufus so

1155
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:39,519
just because it's not

1156
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:41,838
so the whole point of all of this

1157
00:44:39,519 --> 00:44:44,079
all of this is that is to

1158
00:44:41,838 --> 00:44:46,559
is to stable you know figure out what

1159
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:47,440
the economic threshold of a disease is

1160
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:50,318
so

1161
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:52,559
um yeah if some just because it's not

1162
00:44:50,318 --> 00:44:54,800
statistically significant

1163
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:57,599
yeah from a grower perspective it could

1164
00:44:54,800 --> 00:45:00,240
still be economically viable yeah it

1165
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:01,519
could still be worth it um yeah that's

1166
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:04,078
does it talk

1167
00:45:01,519 --> 00:45:06,480
that that's a very very good point so

1168
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:08,800
even though the research may not show

1169
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:11,358
significance the um

1170
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:13,280
visually you're saying so in theory if

1171
00:45:11,358 --> 00:45:16,318
we apply stargas

1172
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:17,359
and it costs us around 500 for the

1173
00:45:16,318 --> 00:45:19,279
season

1174
00:45:17,358 --> 00:45:21,358
and we get

1175
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:23,519
you know half a pound more out of that

1176
00:45:21,358 --> 00:45:24,880
crop or a pound or whatever would would

1177
00:45:23,519 --> 00:45:26,800
make the difference then it's worth

1178
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:28,640
doing that application once we figure in

1179
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,760
the cost of the product and the labor

1180
00:45:28,639 --> 00:45:31,039
association

1181
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,560
and the equipment to make that

1182
00:45:31,039 --> 00:45:34,719
application so

1183
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:36,480
excellent point i i that's that's a very

1184
00:45:34,719 --> 00:45:37,358
good way of explaining that

1185
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,559
um

1186
00:45:37,358 --> 00:45:40,559
so

1187
00:45:38,559 --> 00:45:42,719
you know one i want to i want to kind of

1188
00:45:40,559 --> 00:45:44,400
turn away from this research you've

1189
00:45:42,719 --> 00:45:46,480
i looked you up on google scholar you've

1190
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:48,559
done a lot of research

1191
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:51,679
over the years here uh and one of the

1192
00:45:48,559 --> 00:45:53,358
things you focused on is uh a lot of

1193
00:45:51,679 --> 00:45:55,919
microbial

1194
00:45:53,358 --> 00:45:58,400
products um

1195
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:00,318
or dealing with uh you know microbial

1196
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:02,720
disease

1197
00:46:00,318 --> 00:46:04,960
but i wanted i wanted to just talk

1198
00:46:02,719 --> 00:46:06,078
really quickly about um

1199
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,679
you know you've looked at different

1200
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:09,119
bacillus strains

1201
00:46:07,679 --> 00:46:10,399
for promoting

1202
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:13,519
plant growth

1203
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:14,800
and i'm curious you know

1204
00:46:13,519 --> 00:46:16,559
what

1205
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:18,960
you know your research was on corn and

1206
00:46:16,559 --> 00:46:20,078
wheat and soybean it looks like

1207
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,280
um

1208
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:23,599
how what

1209
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:26,880
bacillus species do you think would be

1210
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:29,838
most promising for research with

1211
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,838
hemp or cannabis

1212
00:46:32,239 --> 00:46:37,118
that's a very good that's a very good

1213
00:46:35,358 --> 00:46:39,598
question and

1214
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:43,039
uh talking about my

1215
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:44,480
some of my previous research on with

1216
00:46:43,039 --> 00:46:46,639
barcelona

1217
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:48,400
with my experience although i have not

1218
00:46:46,639 --> 00:46:52,159
tested any

1219
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:53,920
i've not tested specifically

1220
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:55,279
we're not trying to see the effect of

1221
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:57,760
bacillus

1222
00:46:55,280 --> 00:47:00,240
on on the pottermodule

1223
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:01,839
even though some of the uh on on him

1224
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:04,719
even though some of the product that we

1225
00:47:01,838 --> 00:47:07,838
tested contain uh barcelos

1226
00:47:04,719 --> 00:47:10,159
and we're not like trying to see look at

1227
00:47:07,838 --> 00:47:11,759
the products because we are back in law

1228
00:47:10,159 --> 00:47:15,118
we're trying to look at their mode of

1229
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:16,319
action but in my previous um

1230
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:17,838
uh

1231
00:47:16,318 --> 00:47:20,159
my previous

1232
00:47:17,838 --> 00:47:21,679
research i've looked at effective

1233
00:47:20,159 --> 00:47:24,000
vessels on

1234
00:47:21,679 --> 00:47:25,039
different crops including corn soybean

1235
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,199
and wheat

1236
00:47:25,039 --> 00:47:29,279
and some of the one that we found to be

1237
00:47:27,199 --> 00:47:30,480
very uh effective

1238
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,280
in

1239
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:34,240
in

1240
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:36,960
promoting growth so when i did a study i

1241
00:47:34,239 --> 00:47:40,000
look at the their effect in promoting

1242
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:42,800
growth whether in the absence of disease

1243
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:45,440
or whatever it is is present so that

1244
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:46,960
what i mean that i did not include like

1245
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:49,358
a pathogen

1246
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:51,920
into the the rhizosphere

1247
00:47:49,358 --> 00:47:53,358
to cause this this so we just look at

1248
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:57,039
normal soil

1249
00:47:53,358 --> 00:47:59,759
feed soil we put the the the

1250
00:47:57,039 --> 00:48:02,800
we know collateral the the rhizosphere

1251
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:05,040
with the vessels and in

1252
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:07,359
we watch the plants grow in the

1253
00:48:05,039 --> 00:48:10,639
greenhouse and see what are the batch

1254
00:48:07,358 --> 00:48:13,838
laws going to increase the growth

1255
00:48:10,639 --> 00:48:16,400
in that environment and what we found we

1256
00:48:13,838 --> 00:48:18,480
found that um

1257
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:20,400
that's the last

1258
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:22,800
premium is some

1259
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:24,960
um some penny barcelos

1260
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:26,800
i swear

1261
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:28,159
they were

1262
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,119
effective

1263
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:31,679
in

1264
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:35,760
increasing uh

1265
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:40,239
calm corn growth and

1266
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:42,000
other ones including salvensi and the

1267
00:48:40,239 --> 00:48:45,679
best loss and

1268
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:48,159
megarium was also effective i think from

1269
00:48:45,679 --> 00:48:51,279
soybeans

1270
00:48:48,159 --> 00:48:53,920
so and that's basically what uh

1271
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:55,760
what i've done in with um

1272
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:57,920
bachelors on

1273
00:48:55,760 --> 00:49:00,880
other um

1274
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:05,680
other i mean or other crop

1275
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:07,680
in my greenhouse experiment

1276
00:49:05,679 --> 00:49:09,919
with a

1277
00:49:07,679 --> 00:49:12,239
powder module on hem

1278
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:14,000
we tested some product and one of the i

1279
00:49:12,239 --> 00:49:17,000
think one of the products

1280
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
has

1281
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:23,359
has a bracing loss

1282
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:25,119
i think basilar substitutes

1283
00:49:23,358 --> 00:49:26,639
and i think it was

1284
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:28,240
you know

1285
00:49:26,639 --> 00:49:31,920
strategy

1286
00:49:28,239 --> 00:49:34,399
relatively effective compared to other

1287
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:35,599
products that were tested

1288
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,639
so

1289
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:40,480
yeah that's

1290
00:49:36,639 --> 00:49:42,960
what i i could say about that

1291
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:47,119
so so you found

1292
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:50,880
in in by applying uh rhizobacteria you

1293
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:53,680
got increased plant growth and yield um

1294
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:56,318
up to uh 200 percent increased shoot

1295
00:49:53,679 --> 00:49:58,399
well weight on corn

1296
00:49:56,318 --> 00:50:00,719
but you were doing it sort of like you

1297
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:03,599
said in a vacuum so there was no

1298
00:50:00,719 --> 00:50:06,159
competition for these bacillus strains

1299
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:08,400
um like you would find in a normal

1300
00:50:06,159 --> 00:50:10,558
soil or media um

1301
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:13,599
but but you did find that they were able

1302
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:16,880
to increase yields overall so there's

1303
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:18,640
it's it's promising research but not

1304
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:20,160
not definitive at this point is what you

1305
00:50:18,639 --> 00:50:25,118
would say in terms of

1306
00:50:20,159 --> 00:50:25,118
adding these bacillus species to a crop

1307
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,440
yeah

1308
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:30,880
as

1309
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:32,559
you can see in that study

1310
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:34,640
those

1311
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:36,240
strains that were tested

1312
00:50:34,639 --> 00:50:38,480
are

1313
00:50:36,239 --> 00:50:41,199
talking about the one that increased

1314
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:44,559
very very out to

1315
00:50:41,199 --> 00:50:45,759
the uh let me look at it now

1316
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:49,200
um

1317
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:52,480
yeah penny bass laws uh

1318
00:50:49,199 --> 00:50:55,118
battles offenses that's lost in place

1319
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:58,559
the increased growth in that

1320
00:50:55,119 --> 00:51:00,720
condition we we we include we

1321
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:03,359
inoculate this plant

1322
00:51:00,719 --> 00:51:06,558
the roots with this with these

1323
00:51:03,358 --> 00:51:08,480
vessels and the increased growth then

1324
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:12,559
know that these were

1325
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:15,599
very um isolated that we isolated from

1326
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:17,519
the soil these are not like products

1327
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:21,039
these are not like commercialized

1328
00:51:17,519 --> 00:51:26,159
products and the objective of the study

1329
00:51:21,039 --> 00:51:28,639
was like you know battles they are very

1330
00:51:26,159 --> 00:51:32,000
they they can adapt to

1331
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:33,920
a very uh arch environment

1332
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,880
and also

1333
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:39,200
we also know that

1334
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:41,200
some of the bacillus even though they

1335
00:51:39,199 --> 00:51:44,399
are they might be effective in a

1336
00:51:41,199 --> 00:51:47,118
particular environment or region

1337
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:50,480
when you take them to another region to

1338
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:51,838
apply they may be inconsistent in the

1339
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,800
application

1340
00:51:51,838 --> 00:51:55,759
so

1341
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:58,079
so all of these strain that i work with

1342
00:51:55,760 --> 00:52:00,960
in this particular study

1343
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:03,920
we were we isolated them in that

1344
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:06,240
environment that we intend to use them

1345
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,960
so that we can see where they can you

1346
00:52:06,239 --> 00:52:10,000
know

1347
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:13,358
uh increase growth in that environment

1348
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:15,599
and the objective was this product was

1349
00:52:13,358 --> 00:52:18,400
going to be developed for

1350
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:20,800
further develop for that environment so

1351
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,838
that's that's orientation so and as you

1352
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:24,000
can see

1353
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:27,440
the most of them

1354
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:29,920
work very well on calm in in a

1355
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:34,480
greenhouse in that environment

1356
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:36,480
so the next study which uh probably

1357
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:37,679
they are going to take on

1358
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:39,679
is to

1359
00:52:37,679 --> 00:52:41,919
the most effective one

1360
00:52:39,679 --> 00:52:45,039
to like take you to the feed environment

1361
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:46,639
maybe in a micro plot wire and see

1362
00:52:45,039 --> 00:52:50,558
whether they're gonna have the same

1363
00:52:46,639 --> 00:52:50,558
effect they have in the greenhouse

1364
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:55,039
so so basically you're taking the

1365
00:52:53,358 --> 00:52:57,920
bacillus strain and these are not

1366
00:52:55,039 --> 00:53:00,159
commercially available strains yeah

1367
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:01,680
and um

1368
00:53:00,159 --> 00:53:03,838
you're going to take those and

1369
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:06,000
and since they worked in a

1370
00:53:03,838 --> 00:53:07,119
essentially when they were the only

1371
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,358
uh

1372
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:11,599
bacteria applied to the roots and they

1373
00:53:09,358 --> 00:53:13,199
they did it they did show good results

1374
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:15,280
now you want to take that and apply it

1375
00:53:13,199 --> 00:53:17,519
in a field situation scenario and see if

1376
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:19,040
you get similar results there

1377
00:53:17,519 --> 00:53:21,358
is what yeah

1378
00:53:19,039 --> 00:53:23,440
and i think

1379
00:53:21,358 --> 00:53:25,519
oh go ahead

1380
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:29,280
yeah i said that would be another

1381
00:53:25,519 --> 00:53:31,759
objective research suggested now that i

1382
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:33,920
you know i i did my research in the

1383
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:36,640
greenhouse and

1384
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:37,920
uh the further study now would be to

1385
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:40,480
look at

1386
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:43,760
the the most effective ones

1387
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:46,559
to take them to the feed environment and

1388
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:48,000
apply them to to corners and see if

1389
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:51,119
they're going to have the same effect

1390
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:54,079
they have anywhere else

1391
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:58,318
yeah and one thing this is probably less

1392
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:58,318
something you're familiar with is but um

1393
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:04,159
what what will happen is is i find on

1394
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:06,480
the on the commercial side on the sales

1395
00:54:04,159 --> 00:54:07,679
product side someone would take a paper

1396
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:10,240
like this

1397
00:54:07,679 --> 00:54:13,919
and say okay uh you know just to find

1398
00:54:10,239 --> 00:54:15,439
one bacillus megaterium

1399
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:18,559
they wouldn't worry so much about the

1400
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:20,318
r181 so it's not that particular strain

1401
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:22,480
but they would say okay well bacillus

1402
00:54:20,318 --> 00:54:25,199
megaterium is shown to increase shoot

1403
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:28,000
weight by 200 and then they would go and

1404
00:54:25,199 --> 00:54:30,879
buy bacillus megaterium from

1405
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,838
you know china or you know on alibaba or

1406
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:34,800
something

1407
00:54:31,838 --> 00:54:36,558
as a powder put it on a label and then

1408
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:37,599
they would sell that and make these

1409
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:40,880
claims

1410
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:42,160
so because the biostimulant or microbial

1411
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:43,519
industry

1412
00:54:42,159 --> 00:54:46,159
on the product side is growing

1413
00:54:43,519 --> 00:54:48,559
dramatically and so i would just suggest

1414
00:54:46,159 --> 00:54:50,639
that people do their research and and

1415
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:53,119
then look a little deeper into the

1416
00:54:50,639 --> 00:54:55,920
product itself because

1417
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:57,838
the strain matters um you know yeah it

1418
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:59,599
matters a lot we can't just assume that

1419
00:54:57,838 --> 00:55:02,960
all bacillus subtilis is going to have

1420
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:04,640
the same effect it doesn't and yeah we

1421
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:06,720
also can't assume that something you

1422
00:55:04,639 --> 00:55:08,879
know in vitro or in

1423
00:55:06,719 --> 00:55:11,358
uh you know your plot is gonna have the

1424
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:15,519
same effect as it would in my potting

1425
00:55:11,358 --> 00:55:17,598
soil or in my garden so um

1426
00:55:15,519 --> 00:55:21,280
people need to be careful with data and

1427
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:24,240
how they interpret it um to not

1428
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:26,400
draw conclusions that may not be

1429
00:55:24,239 --> 00:55:27,439
may not be true that's that's all

1430
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,880
because

1431
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:32,480
the canada's industry has a lot of

1432
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:34,240
products and they're not all good and uh

1433
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:36,000
it's something that we talk about a lot

1434
00:55:34,239 --> 00:55:37,279
on this podcast

1435
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:40,318
so

1436
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:43,359
yeah you you make a very good point and

1437
00:55:40,318 --> 00:55:45,599
i just want to emphasize on that again

1438
00:55:43,358 --> 00:55:46,639
you know if you look at my

1439
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:49,200
my

1440
00:55:46,639 --> 00:55:50,078
data on the

1441
00:55:49,199 --> 00:55:52,719
feed

1442
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:55,039
fungicide hem trial

1443
00:55:52,719 --> 00:55:56,318
you you don't see that dead guard and

1444
00:55:55,039 --> 00:55:58,000
status

1445
00:55:56,318 --> 00:56:02,000
do you know that they have

1446
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:04,559
the same species of of bacillus right

1447
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:06,159
yeah we have that i wouldn't so both

1448
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:08,400
products have the same species of

1449
00:56:06,159 --> 00:56:10,558
bacillus is what you're saying yeah yeah

1450
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:12,880
different species of basilars the

1451
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:14,960
different strength but different strains

1452
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:18,240
okay i missed that

1453
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:19,838
yeah and you can see that this here

1454
00:56:18,239 --> 00:56:21,358
different

1455
00:56:19,838 --> 00:56:22,960
effectiveness

1456
00:56:21,358 --> 00:56:24,880
so

1457
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:27,838
very interesting right

1458
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:29,519
yeah so that's how it is with uh

1459
00:56:27,838 --> 00:56:31,838
microorganisms

1460
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:34,400
that they are the same species does not

1461
00:56:31,838 --> 00:56:36,159
mean they're gonna have the same

1462
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:38,960
mode of action

1463
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:43,118
uh because now if you look at the the

1464
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:45,280
second objective in that my microbial

1465
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:47,200
microbial essay study

1466
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:49,680
you see that

1467
00:56:47,199 --> 00:56:53,199
most of you look at the second objective

1468
00:56:49,679 --> 00:56:54,399
is to look at the um mode of actions

1469
00:56:53,199 --> 00:56:55,759
on the

1470
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:57,119
of the

1471
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:59,680
the bachelors

1472
00:56:57,119 --> 00:57:00,880
and what you will find is that

1473
00:56:59,679 --> 00:57:03,759
these

1474
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:04,960
bacillus have different

1475
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:06,720
uh

1476
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:08,159
mode of actions

1477
00:57:06,719 --> 00:57:10,558
even though

1478
00:57:08,159 --> 00:57:12,318
they might be the same species

1479
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:14,720
and they're going to have different

1480
00:57:12,318 --> 00:57:16,558
traits they're going to have different

1481
00:57:14,719 --> 00:57:19,519
traits for instance unless if we ever

1482
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:21,440
get antibiotics against bacteria

1483
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:23,039
they may be the same

1484
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:25,039
the things to see

1485
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:28,480
they're still going to have different

1486
00:57:25,039 --> 00:57:31,279
antibiotics efficiency against other

1487
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:32,159
bacteria or other fungi

1488
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:34,720
uh

1489
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:36,639
they may be able to produce uh one may

1490
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:39,838
be able to produce uh

1491
00:57:36,639 --> 00:57:42,239
therefore on the other

1492
00:57:39,838 --> 00:57:45,599
cannot produce it therefore one may be

1493
00:57:42,239 --> 00:57:48,159
able to like uh maybe produce some

1494
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:51,838
growth a plunger to more and the other

1495
00:57:48,159 --> 00:57:55,199
one uh the other strength cannot do that

1496
00:57:51,838 --> 00:57:57,679
so it is very important that um you know

1497
00:57:55,199 --> 00:58:00,239
that uh

1498
00:57:57,679 --> 00:58:02,558
we consider this trend

1499
00:58:00,239 --> 00:58:05,118
when we are talking about you know that

1500
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:07,119
someone uh one bachelor's

1501
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:09,599
substitutes work

1502
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:12,318
does not mean all personal sustain is

1503
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:14,880
gonna work and that is why

1504
00:58:12,318 --> 00:58:16,079
it's very important that extensive study

1505
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:18,559
is done

1506
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:21,599
on every strain of

1507
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:23,440
bachelors or any but any

1508
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:26,960
from routine agent

1509
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:27,838
or plan about our biological control

1510
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:29,920
agent

1511
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:32,078
essentially research must be done on

1512
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:33,440
that stream before it can

1513
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:34,480
actually be

1514
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:35,200
released

1515
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:37,679
for

1516
00:58:35,199 --> 00:58:39,439
for commercialization

1517
00:58:37,679 --> 00:58:41,118
that that's that's really interesting

1518
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:43,599
and uh

1519
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:45,680
it i think it shows too just how much

1520
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:47,519
research there is

1521
00:58:45,679 --> 00:58:49,118
available to be done

1522
00:58:47,519 --> 00:58:51,679
um on

1523
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:53,920
on hemp and cannabis and that's

1524
00:58:51,679 --> 00:58:56,399
for me that's the most exciting thing

1525
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:59,039
about this plant and one of the things

1526
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:01,920
that i'm most passionate about

1527
00:58:59,039 --> 00:59:03,838
with this industry is that we can do

1528
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:05,760
this research and even if the research

1529
00:59:03,838 --> 00:59:06,960
that say um

1530
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:09,839
you know my

1531
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:12,159
my my good friend and colleague

1532
00:59:09,838 --> 00:59:14,318
ben higgins is doing even though it's

1533
00:59:12,159 --> 00:59:16,399
not backed by a university it can be

1534
00:59:14,318 --> 00:59:18,960
preliminary work where we could say hey

1535
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:20,000
we're seeing statistical trending that

1536
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:22,159
this

1537
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,400
you know this product may have this

1538
00:59:22,159 --> 00:59:25,358
suppression effect or

1539
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,240
you know

1540
00:59:25,358 --> 00:59:28,558
running

1541
00:59:26,239 --> 00:59:30,879
nutrients at this level will cause this

1542
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:33,359
sort of plant growth response

1543
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:35,358
to where then then a university or

1544
00:59:33,358 --> 00:59:36,159
someone like yourself a researcher could

1545
00:59:35,358 --> 00:59:37,838
then

1546
00:59:36,159 --> 00:59:39,759
repeat the trial

1547
00:59:37,838 --> 00:59:42,159
and get more uh

1548
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:44,799
you know more data to to make a

1549
00:59:42,159 --> 00:59:46,639
a better decision for growers long term

1550
00:59:44,798 --> 00:59:48,400
so

1551
00:59:46,639 --> 00:59:51,759
it's it's an exciting industry to be a

1552
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:53,358
part of and we need the research that

1553
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:55,599
you know people like yourself is are

1554
00:59:53,358 --> 00:59:58,078
