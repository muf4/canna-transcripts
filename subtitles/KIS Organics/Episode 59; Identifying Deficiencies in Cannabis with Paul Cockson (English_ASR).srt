CC my guest this week is Paul Coxon Paul

23
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,400
has been working with plants since 2008

24
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:18,959
his love for plants was a lifelong

25
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,969
passion that developed and grew through

26
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:22,349
the Nebraska Master Gardener program and

27
00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:24,629
through his involvement with human nurse

28
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:26,669
nursery Paul received his Bachelors of

29
00:01:24,629 --> 00:01:28,349
Science from NC State during which time

30
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,629
he published five journal articles

31
00:01:28,349 --> 00:01:32,759
received the International Society for

science young minds award say that ten

34
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,540
times fast published over 20 extension

35
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:41,790
and outreach publications and published

36
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,829
three ebooks Paul has a passion for

37
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:45,600
scientific investigation with the end

38
00:01:43,828 --> 00:01:48,029
goal of providing growers and producers

39
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:49,798
with applicable and impactful production

40
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:51,420
knowledge and practices Paul is

41
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:53,490
currently pursuing his master's of

42
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:56,040
science and horticulture at NC State

43
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:59,368
under the direction of dr. Brian he whip

44
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:02,159
ker hey Paul thanks for coming on the

45
00:01:59,368 --> 00:02:04,368
show today hey thanks for having me I

46
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,618
really appreciate this

47
00:02:04,368 --> 00:02:08,810
yeah let's go ahead and start off giving

48
00:02:06,618 --> 00:02:10,818
listeners a little bit of your

49
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:12,729
background and how you came into this

50
00:02:10,818 --> 00:02:14,539
role that you have at the University

51
00:02:12,729 --> 00:02:18,079
yeah for sure

52
00:02:14,539 --> 00:02:20,479
so I have always been interested in

53
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,390
plants ever since I was a kid they were

54
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:25,669
a passion of mine and that passion just

55
00:02:23,389 --> 00:02:27,169
kind of grew and evolved over my life I

56
00:02:25,669 --> 00:02:30,109
was involved in the Master Gardener

57
00:02:27,169 --> 00:02:33,378
program went to numerous extension

58
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:35,599
events and just through kind of a

59
00:02:33,378 --> 00:02:38,179
roundabout way ended up at North

60
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:41,988
Carolina State University and I actually

61
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:44,390
got my bachelor's here and it started

62
00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:47,989
working with plants under dr. Brian whip

63
00:02:44,389 --> 00:02:50,719
Kerr doing floriculture work with him

64
00:02:47,989 --> 00:02:53,299
and continued working with him through

65
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:55,909
my bachelors and the opportunity came

66
00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:57,530
for me to sign on with the Masters for

67
00:02:55,909 --> 00:03:01,430
him and I'm currently you're into that

68
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:03,169
and it's been one wild ride and never

69
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:07,400
expected to be doing work with cannabis

70
00:03:03,169 --> 00:03:08,929
but here we are yeah you told me a

71
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,819
little bit about that off air how you

72
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:12,530
guys applied for a license and we're

73
00:03:10,818 --> 00:03:15,768
able to get one and have started doing

74
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:18,169
some research with cannabis or more

75
00:03:15,769 --> 00:03:20,150
specifically hemp do you want to talk a

76
00:03:18,169 --> 00:03:21,589
little about some of the papers that

77
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:24,530
you've there's some of the research

78
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:25,489
that's happened at your university yeah

79
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:28,340
sure

80
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:30,709
so yeah it's the way that we got

81
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:33,859
involved in cannabis it's kind of a

82
00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:35,269
roundabout story dr. Wilker and I were

83
00:03:33,859 --> 00:03:36,889
just kind of talking one day in the

84
00:03:35,269 --> 00:03:40,159
greenhouse just you know shooting the

85
00:03:36,889 --> 00:03:42,469
breeze and I joked with him and said you

86
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:44,539
know hey let's you know work in him

87
00:03:42,469 --> 00:03:46,189
because hemp had just become legalized

88
00:03:44,539 --> 00:03:48,679
in our state you know he kind of laughed

89
00:03:46,189 --> 00:03:50,180
at it and then two months later he

90
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,739
contacted me he's like hey I've just

91
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:54,169
applied for a license we're gonna be

92
00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:56,689
doing work with him and you know ever

93
00:03:54,169 --> 00:03:58,669
since then it's been just one crazy

94
00:03:56,689 --> 00:04:00,709
research project after another and it's

95
00:03:58,669 --> 00:04:02,620
opened a lot of amazing doors for us so

96
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:05,299
we're really glad that we got into it

97
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:10,819
but as far as some of the work that

98
00:04:05,299 --> 00:04:13,610
we've done we got into cannabis and you

99
00:04:10,818 --> 00:04:15,889
know normally when you are looking at

100
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:16,790
researching a new area you know you jump

101
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:18,769
on

102
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:19,939
and you'll do a literature review and

103
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:22,189
look at you know published literature

104
00:04:19,939 --> 00:04:23,990
and you know I got on and jumped on

105
00:04:22,189 --> 00:04:28,879
Google Scholar and typed in either

106
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:31,220
cannabis sativa and I think I used the

107
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:34,370
all in title function and I got 12

108
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:38,750
results and it was then that I knew that

109
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:41,899
we were in for one wild ride so we

110
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:44,750
basically had to start at the foundation

111
00:04:41,899 --> 00:04:46,789
as far as research goes because you know

112
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:50,300
we wanted to establish some baselines

113
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:55,879
for nutrients for lighting for growing a

114
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:59,090
pH work etc so that's that's kind of how

115
00:04:55,879 --> 00:05:01,430
we got started I can go more into the

116
00:04:59,089 --> 00:05:04,310
specific projects that we've done if

117
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:07,389
you'd like yeah let's do it why don't

118
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:09,920
you tell us about your first foray into

119
00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:12,409
any cannabis research and just for

120
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,699
listeners to let them know I do have one

121
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:15,830
of your papers in front of me the

122
00:05:13,699 --> 00:05:17,420
characterization of nutrient disorders

123
00:05:15,829 --> 00:05:19,490
of canvas sativa so we'll probably spend

124
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:21,290
a little more time on that I'm gonna be

125
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:22,759
kind of flying blind on questions as I

126
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:25,700
don't have the access to the other

127
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:27,079
papers at this time but yeah if you want

128
00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:28,939
to kind of describe some of the research

129
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:31,430
that you've done and what some of your

130
00:05:28,939 --> 00:05:33,129
findings we're I'd love to kind of go

131
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:36,530
through that in a little more detail

132
00:05:33,129 --> 00:05:40,550
yeah for sure um so one of the first

133
00:05:36,529 --> 00:05:44,839
things that we did was starting from the

134
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:46,689
ground up basically or the soil up the

135
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:50,859
two first projects that we started doing

136
00:05:46,689 --> 00:05:54,980
we were looking at optimal routing

137
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:58,160
through clonal cuttings because we

138
00:05:54,980 --> 00:06:00,290
realized quickly that sourcing through

139
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,590
seed was just not the way to go so we

140
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:07,760
started clonally propagating everything

141
00:06:02,589 --> 00:06:11,839
but we were experiencing a huge variety

142
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:15,529
of reading habits and successes when

143
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:18,619
trying to clone root cannabis clonally

144
00:06:15,529 --> 00:06:20,209
and in the floriculture industry we've

145
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:22,189
had a long time to kind of standardize

146
00:06:20,209 --> 00:06:24,829
things so that variability that we're

147
00:06:22,189 --> 00:06:26,839
seeing really intrigued us so one of the

148
00:06:24,829 --> 00:06:28,490
first two studies we did we did a

149
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:29,659
reading study and that has been

150
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:32,259
published

151
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:35,090
we looked at these a bottom heat and

152
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:35,949
also the diameter of the cutting the

153
00:06:35,089 --> 00:06:38,719
caliper

154
00:06:35,949 --> 00:06:40,610
looking at how those two factors would

155
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:44,780
impact reading bigger and routing

156
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:47,150
success and then the next piece of work

157
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:50,389
that we did was looking at optimal

158
00:06:47,149 --> 00:06:53,509
substrate ph's and that was in tandem

159
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:54,379
with another lab here at NC State doing

160
00:06:53,509 --> 00:06:57,769
work there

161
00:06:54,379 --> 00:07:00,379
the substrate slab so those were the

162
00:06:57,769 --> 00:07:03,560
kind of the foundation that we did and

163
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:05,149
then from there we kind of went into the

164
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,009
nutrient deficiency work that you have

165
00:07:05,149 --> 00:07:09,469
in front of you trying to characterize

166
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:11,870
nutrients and nutrient deficiencies and

167
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:16,820
then we've also had another study

168
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:19,670
published where we went into lighting

169
00:07:16,819 --> 00:07:21,409
and photo period a bit we're looking at

170
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:23,720
daylight extension lighting regimes

171
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:26,540
versus nine interruption of lighting

172
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:29,120
regimes and I guess I should back up the

173
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:32,750
very first study that we did was a

174
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:35,569
baseline hemp nutrients leaf tissue

175
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:37,910
survey because we had no idea what

176
00:07:35,569 --> 00:07:39,259
optimal nutrients were so we traveled

177
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:42,140
around the state to different growers

178
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:44,860
operations and we took samples off of

179
00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:50,990
their plants and something into the lab

180
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:52,970
here NC da and got some values back and

181
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:56,689
established the baseline and that work

182
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:57,890
has also been published well I kind of

183
00:07:56,689 --> 00:07:59,029
want to talk about the findings from

184
00:07:57,889 --> 00:08:01,430
each of these because I think they're

185
00:07:59,029 --> 00:08:03,619
all really interesting but let's start

186
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:05,990
with what you were just describing

187
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:11,050
they're in court of just surveying and

188
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:15,740
establishing sort of ranges for cannabis

189
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:16,730
using tissue tissue analysis what can

190
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:18,650
you talk about the sort of the

191
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:21,560
methodology of that and that process and

192
00:08:18,649 --> 00:08:25,279
how you determined what a healthy plant

193
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:28,220
look like in terms of those ranges yes

194
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:31,129
so this was kind of the the dirty mucky

195
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:34,519
science that very few scientists will

196
00:08:31,129 --> 00:08:38,299
actually want to reveal it's very

197
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:41,478
foundational work most of the time when

198
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:43,549
you're dealing with a new crop or a new

199
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:46,879
discovered crop it's kind of

200
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:49,189
shotgun approach so one of the reasons

201
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:52,789
that we went through multiple different

202
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:54,500
locations to try and find healthy plants

203
00:08:52,789 --> 00:08:56,360
is because you know fertilizer types

204
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:59,528
were different and growing conditions

205
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:02,120
were different and you know the kind of

206
00:08:59,528 --> 00:09:04,189
you know management strategies were

207
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,600
different irrigation was different and

208
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:07,010
that that introduced a lot of

209
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,830
variability so we were trying to

210
00:09:07,009 --> 00:09:13,789
homogenize the landscape by taking a

211
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:16,490
general survey and that is not to be

212
00:09:13,789 --> 00:09:18,289
used as kind of like the golden rule of

213
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:19,610
you know this is what adequate leaf

214
00:09:18,289 --> 00:09:23,449
tissue parts per million

215
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:25,519
looks like the survey was just not to be

216
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:28,430
more of an informational guideline to

217
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:31,100
growers saying that you know these

218
00:09:28,429 --> 00:09:33,708
plants which appeared healthy and were

219
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:36,170
growing vigorously had adequate

220
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:38,838
nutrients and from what we can infer

221
00:09:36,169 --> 00:09:42,319
from other crops they appear to be

222
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:44,959
within the healthy range and that work

223
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,480
that kind of springboarded into the

224
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:51,109
nutrient disorders work which is getting

225
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:56,149
closer to establishing fertility

226
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:57,350
guidelines for cannabis got it so you

227
00:09:56,149 --> 00:09:59,179
know what you're essentially what you're

228
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:00,620
saying is you don't want people to draw

229
00:09:59,179 --> 00:10:02,838
too many conclusions from your

230
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:06,110
preliminary work they're that paper

231
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:10,130
other than to see that there may be a

232
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:12,440
possible range here of a tissue of

233
00:10:10,129 --> 00:10:14,028
elements in the tissue that maybe allow

234
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:17,180
you to grow what appears to be a healthy

235
00:10:14,028 --> 00:10:19,879
plant correct yeah so science is a very

236
00:10:17,179 --> 00:10:22,819
additive process and the more and more

237
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:24,669
experiments you do in a specific

238
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:28,190
research direction or research question

239
00:10:24,669 --> 00:10:31,399
they begin to add together to form the

240
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:33,980
whole picture and from that then you can

241
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:35,870
start inferring and making guidelines so

242
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:39,950
we're getting close with some of the

243
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:42,200
work that we've done but it's like like

244
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:44,930
I said cannabis is still very new for

245
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:46,930
research and so we're still just you

246
00:10:44,929 --> 00:10:50,809
know beginning to green gained traction

247
00:10:46,929 --> 00:10:52,458
with the research I think that's a

248
00:10:50,809 --> 00:10:56,049
really good point that you're making

249
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:57,319
there so that people will consider how

250
00:10:56,049 --> 00:10:59,000
you know how

251
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,920
this may point them in in sort of a

252
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,690
direction of a trend but there's still

253
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:05,059
so much research than me to be done I

254
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:06,800
mean if you were talking about a you

255
00:11:05,059 --> 00:11:08,209
know an established crop like corn you'd

256
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:11,389
find thousands of papers just on

257
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:12,769
nitrogen that could discuss this and a

258
00:11:11,389 --> 00:11:14,509
lot of tissue work that's been done

259
00:11:12,769 --> 00:11:17,240
across a variety of different scenarios

260
00:11:14,509 --> 00:11:20,600
and environments to where you you can

261
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:22,279
start really drawing strong correlations

262
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:25,639
but we just don't have any of that work

263
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:29,809
so it's it's still very preliminary like

264
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:33,289
you like you mentioned exactly yes I did

265
00:11:29,809 --> 00:11:37,099
want to you mention propagation I did

266
00:11:33,289 --> 00:11:40,689
have Dr Kaplan Darren Kaplan on from the

267
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:42,980
Guelph he did work with dr. Zhang on

268
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:45,230
propagation already now I don't know did

269
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:48,620
your work come before or after their

270
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:51,379
paper which was released in I think May

271
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:53,870
of 2018 and is there any correlation

272
00:11:51,379 --> 00:11:55,759
there or any anything that you found

273
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:58,370
that sort of fit or didn't fit with the

274
00:11:55,759 --> 00:12:02,299
work that they did yes

275
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:05,600
so Kathleen's work came before ours ours

276
00:12:02,299 --> 00:12:09,649
was just published at the end of I

277
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:13,159
believe it was 2018 is when ours came

278
00:12:09,649 --> 00:12:16,730
out so his work came before ours and as

279
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:18,699
far as the the correlations between the

280
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:21,409
two works there were some similarities

281
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:24,020
but for the most part we were also

282
00:12:21,409 --> 00:12:25,339
exploring slightly different things you

283
00:12:24,019 --> 00:12:28,340
know for example he used rooting

284
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:30,230
hormones and his work and we did not

285
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:35,600
look at rooting hormones we were looking

286
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:37,610
more at the caliper bottom heat so when

287
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,659
you say caliper just for people who may

288
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:42,230
not be familiar with the term you're

289
00:12:38,659 --> 00:12:47,779
talking about the measurement of the

290
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:51,440
diameter of the stem correct and when

291
00:12:47,779 --> 00:12:53,750
you say sorry so you were measuring

292
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,270
you're measuring the caliper in terms of

293
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:59,149
the routing success of that particular

294
00:12:56,269 --> 00:13:02,919
cutting is that correct yeah so

295
00:12:59,149 --> 00:13:07,279
basically when floriculture

296
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:09,799
when you're trying to establish a more

297
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:13,909
vigorous cutting

298
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:15,889
a vegetative cutting you'll apply heat

299
00:13:13,909 --> 00:13:17,600
to the bottom of the tray or bottom of

300
00:13:15,889 --> 00:13:20,269
the bench or close to the bottom and

301
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,839
that increases the temperature of the

302
00:13:20,269 --> 00:13:26,959
substrate and what that does is it helps

303
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:30,529
speed up the routing across us in some

304
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:32,028
species in others that will have little

305
00:13:30,528 --> 00:13:34,070
to no effect so we were trying to

306
00:13:32,028 --> 00:13:35,659
explore that and then the other area

307
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:38,570
that we were exploring is the caliper

308
00:13:35,659 --> 00:13:41,179
which when you take a tip cutting from

309
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:43,010
another stock plant and you kind of take

310
00:13:41,179 --> 00:13:44,239
the tip portion and you point it away

311
00:13:43,009 --> 00:13:46,220
from yourself and you look at the end

312
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,750
that you cut it and then you were to

313
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:51,950
measure the diameter of that that would

314
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:54,230
be the caliper and the theory was that a

315
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:56,899
thicker caliper could potentially have

316
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:59,450
more surface area for the callus to

317
00:13:56,899 --> 00:14:02,120
increase route proliferation and a

318
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:05,269
thicker caliper could also potentially

319
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:09,230
have more reserves so more photosynthate

320
00:14:05,269 --> 00:14:12,379
etc that the plant could draw on to help

321
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:13,909
with the healing and reading process was

322
00:14:12,379 --> 00:14:18,649
kind of the line of thinking that we

323
00:14:13,909 --> 00:14:22,189
went down and did your research support

324
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:26,360
your hypothesis yes so what we found

325
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:30,110
that was that we divided calipers into 3

326
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:32,750
differents sizes small medium and large

327
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:34,159
as far as the caliper was concerned and

328
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:36,139
we did find that there was a

329
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:42,500
statistically significant difference in

330
00:14:36,139 --> 00:14:44,870
routing between the the small caliper

331
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:47,299
and the large caliper but not between

332
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:50,179
the small in the medium or the meteor in

333
00:14:47,299 --> 00:14:52,939
a large caliper and so what that means

334
00:14:50,179 --> 00:14:54,919
is that when we actually looked at the

335
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:57,320
date of routing the bigger of routing

336
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:59,870
and we actually then screened the

337
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:03,260
routing through a visual scale that the

338
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:06,860
larger caliper produced more vigorous

339
00:15:03,259 --> 00:15:10,069
roots rather than when compared to the

340
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:12,220
small caliper and when you say enlarge I

341
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:16,278
assume you're still talking about fairly

342
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:18,440
immature vegetative plants I do know

343
00:15:16,278 --> 00:15:21,049
that cannabis can develop a woody or

344
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:23,810
stem over time which can it appears to

345
00:15:21,049 --> 00:15:25,819
inhibit cloning or

346
00:15:23,809 --> 00:15:27,799
propagation I can you talk a little bit

347
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:30,020
about your how you established your

348
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:32,659
experiment and what what you really were

349
00:15:30,019 --> 00:15:37,220
comparing there yeah so to answer your

350
00:15:32,659 --> 00:15:41,679
question how we kind of went along the

351
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:44,899
lines of exploring how to quantify the

352
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:47,599
size of the confetti or the caliper we

353
00:15:44,899 --> 00:15:50,870
actually went in to mother stock plants

354
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:53,870
we took some other stock plants and we

355
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:56,120
took vegetative kind of things off of

356
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:58,190
those and the paper goes into a little

357
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:00,470
more detail on how we quantified that I

358
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:03,200
won't bore you with the details here but

359
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:05,240
we divided all of the cuttings kind of

360
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:07,278
did a survey and looked at the different

361
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:11,600
calipers and the different caliper pools

362
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:14,809
and from that we came up with the sizes

363
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:20,180
that we used for our study and the small

364
00:16:14,809 --> 00:16:21,979
size was 1.7 to 2 millimeters medium

365
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:24,739
size was two point three to two point

366
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:26,690
six millimeters and the large caliper

367
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:30,049
was two point nine to three point two

368
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:33,490
millimeters and so that's that's kind of

369
00:16:30,049 --> 00:16:37,129
the general process of how we approached

370
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:39,470
categorizing what a typical caliper

371
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:42,439
would be on an arm other stock plants

372
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:44,050
that we were managing and then how we

373
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:46,850
divided them up for the study

374
00:16:44,049 --> 00:16:50,000
now did you look at where on the plant

375
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:51,800
itself that the cutting was taken from

376
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,620
in terms of from near the top of the

377
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:56,719
plants near the base of the plant

378
00:16:54,620 --> 00:17:01,129
was that something that was factored in

379
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:04,429
it all in this particular study yeah so

380
00:17:01,129 --> 00:17:07,699
we only took from secondary tertiary and

381
00:17:04,429 --> 00:17:11,769
quaternary branches and basically what

382
00:17:07,699 --> 00:17:14,120
that means is you have the central stock

383
00:17:11,769 --> 00:17:16,459
from which all the other branches come

384
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:18,678
off so that's considered the primary and

385
00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:20,959
so any branch that comes off of that

386
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:22,040
would be secondary any consecutive

387
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,560
branch that comes off and that would be

388
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:26,599
tertiary so on and so forth

389
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:30,889
and like I said the paper which is

390
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:34,269
freely available through Murray State

391
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:37,400
University the Journal of agriculture

392
00:17:34,269 --> 00:17:40,069
agricultural hemp research

393
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:41,920
has a wonderful diagram in there on how

394
00:17:40,069 --> 00:17:45,319
we actually took the cuttings and

395
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:48,470
quantified the branches but as far as

396
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:50,899
looking at say an interior canopy

397
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:55,220
cutting versus an exterior canopy

398
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:57,740
cutting we were only taking shoot tips

399
00:17:55,220 --> 00:18:01,180
from the exterior portion of the canopy

400
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:05,210
and what I mean by a shoot tip is only

401
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:08,120
the terminal growing portion of a

402
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:11,870
cutting so it terminated in a growing

403
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:13,279
tip that makes sense yeah so you weren't

404
00:18:11,869 --> 00:18:15,379
you weren't taking more than one cutting

405
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:17,359
off of that that branch so in theory you

406
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:20,390
could go down another few inches and

407
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:22,879
take another cutting but you didn't do

408
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:25,190
that for this experiment okay I get were

409
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:28,220
saying were there any other findings

410
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:30,350
from this particular study that you

411
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:31,519
wanted to share besides what you just

412
00:18:30,349 --> 00:18:33,230
shared regarding caliper

413
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:39,680
larger caliper reading better than

414
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:41,900
smaller caliper yes so like I said that

415
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:43,970
there was a statistically significant

416
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:48,910
difference between the small caliper and

417
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:52,700
the large caliper and as far as the

418
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:56,480
percentage of cuttings that had rooted

419
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:58,519
at 14 days versus 28 days there was a

420
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:01,670
statistical difference in this study

421
00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:04,039
between adding root zone heating or

422
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:08,150
bottom heating versus not utilizing

423
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:10,519
about a bottom heating so that was

424
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:13,640
another interesting question interesting

425
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:16,279
finding from the study rather what was

426
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:18,350
your control temperature and then what

427
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:21,549
did you raise it to with the the root

428
00:19:18,349 --> 00:19:24,129
zone - with the bottom heating and how

429
00:19:21,549 --> 00:19:27,019
statistically significant are we talking

430
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:29,150
across adding that heat matter heat

431
00:19:27,019 --> 00:19:33,589
source yeah

432
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:36,710
so the what we did is we measured the

433
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:38,509
substrate temperature so the substrate

434
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:40,549
temperature was twenty seven point eight

435
00:19:38,509 --> 00:19:46,849
degrees centigrade without root zone

436
00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:49,639
heating and then it was sorry that was

437
00:19:46,849 --> 00:19:50,929
with root zone heating and the average

438
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:55,100
temperature was 25

439
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:58,670
six degrees centigrade without so we

440
00:19:55,099 --> 00:20:02,329
increased the root zone temperature by

441
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:04,070
roughly 2 degrees centigrade okay just

442
00:20:02,329 --> 00:20:06,980
to save all of us Americans who are

443
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:10,339
terrible at Celsius I'm gonna do this

444
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:12,680
calculation for people so 28.7 Celsius

445
00:20:10,339 --> 00:20:13,639
is eighty three point six six degrees

446
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,560
Fahrenheit

447
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:18,770
that was your heated temperature what

448
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:22,480
was your sorry what was the control

449
00:20:18,769 --> 00:20:25,420
again yes

450
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:29,509
sorry that's 27 point eight degrees

451
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:32,140
centigrade for the treatment oh okay so

452
00:20:29,509 --> 00:20:36,349
the treatment was 27 points so 82

453
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:39,230
degrees Fahrenheit correct and then for

454
00:20:36,349 --> 00:20:42,039
the control it was 25 point six degrees

455
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:42,039
centigrade

456
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:46,690
correct

457
00:20:51,589 --> 00:20:53,649
you

458
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,309
correct yes

459
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:10,019
yeah

460
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:11,548
so when when doing a study like this you

461
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:13,798
don't want to raise the temperature the

462
00:21:11,548 --> 00:21:15,690
read zone temperature too much because

463
00:21:13,798 --> 00:21:19,589
you don't want to potentially desiccate

464
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:23,159
or damage any roots that are forming or

465
00:21:19,589 --> 00:21:25,649
even the catalyst as it forms so that's

466
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:30,929
why the temperature differential wasn't

467
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:32,909
overly large yeah I would have thought

468
00:21:30,929 --> 00:21:37,409
that maybe the control temperature might

469
00:21:32,909 --> 00:21:39,870
have been lower rather than the heated

470
00:21:37,409 --> 00:21:43,919
temperature be higher but no that's

471
00:21:39,869 --> 00:21:46,798
great yeah we this experiment was

472
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:49,830
conducted during the summer so we were

473
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:52,859
in a poly house and the cooling

474
00:21:49,829 --> 00:21:55,859
coefficient on a poly house is much less

475
00:21:52,859 --> 00:21:58,109
so that's why the temperatures were a

476
00:21:55,859 --> 00:22:01,379
little higher for the control that makes

477
00:21:58,109 --> 00:22:03,769
sense that makes sense okay great so

478
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:07,770
let's move on to another one of the

479
00:22:03,769 --> 00:22:08,940
papers that you mentioned prior to you

480
00:22:07,769 --> 00:22:12,960
know prior to talking about this

481
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:17,278
nutrient disorder paper okay

482
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:19,259
our use the substrate pH work the other

483
00:22:17,278 --> 00:22:21,269
one that we did kind of on that ground

484
00:22:19,259 --> 00:22:23,398
up approach we're still in the process

485
00:22:21,269 --> 00:22:25,889
of publishing a paper so that one has

486
00:22:23,398 --> 00:22:29,099
happened at least yet those results will

487
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:33,140
be forthcoming okay I understand so

488
00:22:29,099 --> 00:22:35,219
maybe we do dive right into the nutrient

489
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:41,130
nutrient disorder paper that you wrote

490
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:43,230
or co-authored okay now one of the

491
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:45,020
things you talked about with this paper

492
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:47,759
was that you guys really are a team

493
00:22:45,019 --> 00:22:49,740
there at the University is there any

494
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:51,329
anything you want to mention prior to

495
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:52,500
starting talking about or did you want

496
00:22:51,329 --> 00:22:54,269
to kind of as we go through the paper

497
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:57,960
mention the people that were involved in

498
00:22:54,269 --> 00:23:02,639
different aspects of this work yeah

499
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:05,190
that'd be great yeah so in our lab we

500
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:07,080
have been really blessed to have a group

501
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:09,480
of fantastic researchers and

502
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:11,490
collaborators that we've worked with on

503
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,899
all of these projects both the projects

504
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:16,079
that we have completed have published

505
00:23:12,898 --> 00:23:19,679
and are doing so yeah

506
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:22,970
gabi Barajas Patrick needs the david

507
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:25,650
logan matthew davis kimberly McAlister

508
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:28,440
our collaborator dr. Nichelle Schroeder

509
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:32,190
Moreno or other collaborator dr. Brian

510
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:35,190
Jackson and my major professor dr. Brian

511
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:37,920
Becker we all form a fantastic team of

512
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:39,570
collaborators some of these people have

513
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:41,759
been involved on all the projects others

514
00:23:39,569 --> 00:23:44,069
are collaborators on some projects but

515
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:47,759
research definitely does not take place

516
00:23:44,069 --> 00:23:49,769
in a vacuum and as far as the research

517
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:51,710
process goes we've been really blessed I

518
00:23:49,769 --> 00:23:56,069
had some amazing collaborators and

519
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:58,559
people in our lab that's great I mean it

520
00:23:56,069 --> 00:24:00,119
really does take a team and I think it's

521
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:02,069
important to recognize that when you see

522
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:03,949
a name on a paper that's not the full

523
00:24:02,069 --> 00:24:06,569
story of the work that went into it so

524
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:07,650
thanks for highlighting that now this

525
00:24:06,569 --> 00:24:09,659
paper itself

526
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:11,850
it's called characterization of nutrient

527
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:14,070
disorders of cannabis sativa it was

528
00:24:11,849 --> 00:24:16,379
brought to my attention recently I mean

529
00:24:14,069 --> 00:24:19,409
it's only was published in October 18th

530
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:22,050
of 2019 do you want to give a quick

531
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:23,519
highlight or sort of a rough idea of

532
00:24:22,049 --> 00:24:25,710
what the abstract was with this paper

533
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:30,119
and what your goals were when you first

534
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:31,730
started doing this research yeah so like

535
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:35,459
I said the first paper that we published

536
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:37,049
was that general survey paper and that

537
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:39,240
one is published and that's meant to be

538
00:24:37,049 --> 00:24:41,339
kind of a shotgun approach to guidelines

539
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,809
you know these were the ranges we saw in

540
00:24:41,339 --> 00:24:46,919
multiple different cultivars across

541
00:24:42,809 --> 00:24:48,750
different growing conditions this one is

542
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:54,180
trying to be a little more targeted and

543
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:57,359
kind of narrow in on optimal fertility

544
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:58,860
recommendations for him and trying to

545
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:01,740
figure out what kind of fertility

546
00:24:58,859 --> 00:25:05,299
cannabis plants need in order to balance

547
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:10,410
the nutrient cost input to growers and

548
00:25:05,299 --> 00:25:11,909
maximize the you know CBD content and

549
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:16,980
flower content depending on what you're

550
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:19,529
growing for so for this specific work we

551
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:22,019
were looking at nutrient deficiencies so

552
00:25:19,529 --> 00:25:27,509
what that means is we were trying to

553
00:25:22,019 --> 00:25:29,879
stress the plants down to a level where

554
00:25:27,509 --> 00:25:33,269
we could visually see symptoms

555
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:38,250
of nutrients stress and then we could

556
00:25:33,269 --> 00:25:41,429
take foliar leaf tissue and send that

557
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:44,460
off to a lab and compare that to plants

558
00:25:41,429 --> 00:25:46,470
that we grew with a complete fertility

559
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:49,019
machine and that complete fertility

560
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:53,220
regime is based off of what's called a

561
00:25:49,019 --> 00:25:57,058
modified Hoagland solution it's a

562
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:59,788
standard hydroponic water-soluble

563
00:25:57,058 --> 00:26:02,250
nutrient fertilizer regime that

564
00:25:59,788 --> 00:26:05,339
basically balances all of the cations

565
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:07,740
and anions and is supposed to provide a

566
00:26:05,339 --> 00:26:09,808
plant with everything that it needs as

567
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:12,808
far as its macro and micronutrients are

568
00:26:09,808 --> 00:26:16,230
concerned so we were trying to withhold

569
00:26:12,808 --> 00:26:19,259
an element from a plant from that recipe

570
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:21,808
to induce our deficiency and they

571
00:26:19,259 --> 00:26:25,349
compared those visual symptoms and the

572
00:26:21,808 --> 00:26:27,240
leaf tissue analyses back to that plant

573
00:26:25,349 --> 00:26:30,599
and that plant that received everything

574
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:33,630
was our control now are there is there

575
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:37,589
research out there showing and success

576
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:41,549
and growing with this Hoagland solution

577
00:26:37,589 --> 00:26:42,990
or formula with cannabis or were you

578
00:26:41,548 --> 00:26:44,429
kind of going into a little bit of new

579
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:49,339
territory with that in terms of is

580
00:26:44,429 --> 00:26:51,659
making pulling from other crops yeah so

581
00:26:49,339 --> 00:26:53,788
dr. wicker myself

582
00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:59,610
numerous other scientists have used the

583
00:26:53,788 --> 00:27:03,058
solution to provide fertility for a wide

584
00:26:59,609 --> 00:27:06,538
array of plants so as far as specific to

585
00:27:03,058 --> 00:27:09,149
cannabis you know we were the first to

586
00:27:06,538 --> 00:27:12,538
kind of pioneer a Hoagland solution with

587
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:14,990
cannabis but as far as the general

588
00:27:12,538 --> 00:27:17,460
literature is concerned it has been

589
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:19,470
tested on numerous different plants

590
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:24,298
numerous different crops and proved to

591
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:24,929
be adequate okay so and just out of

592
00:27:24,298 --> 00:27:26,460
curiosity

593
00:27:24,929 --> 00:27:28,500
so as you started growing with this

594
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:31,860
toquyen solution is this baseline for

595
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:34,250
fertility just anecdotally you found

596
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:37,109
that it seemed to be providing

597
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:38,819
appropriate nutrient levels across the

598
00:27:37,109 --> 00:27:44,038
board for macro and micro nutrients for

599
00:27:38,819 --> 00:27:46,319
for cannabis correct yes and so

600
00:27:44,038 --> 00:27:48,808
kind of how the research logic goes as

601
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:50,849
we took a broad survey approach that was

602
00:27:48,808 --> 00:27:53,158
our first paper and then we kind of

603
00:27:50,849 --> 00:27:56,459
wanted to see what would happen if we

604
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:58,679
took away a singular nutrient from the

605
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:01,169
plant and what that would do to the leaf

606
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:03,330
tissue value is compared to the survey

607
00:28:01,169 --> 00:28:05,609
that we had and what that would do to

608
00:28:03,329 --> 00:28:08,638
the you know control plant that was

609
00:28:05,608 --> 00:28:10,739
receiving adequate fertility that has

610
00:28:08,638 --> 00:28:13,788
been proven to the adequate for multiple

611
00:28:10,739 --> 00:28:16,108
different crop species and then

612
00:28:13,788 --> 00:28:17,429
currently what we're doing and I know

613
00:28:16,108 --> 00:28:20,368
we're getting off track a bit but

614
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:23,278
currently we are then modifying the

615
00:28:20,368 --> 00:28:25,348
Hoagland solution that solution for all

616
00:28:23,278 --> 00:28:28,888
macro and micro nutrients at different

617
00:28:25,348 --> 00:28:33,868
rates to try and get a fully relief

618
00:28:28,888 --> 00:28:37,319
tissue curve if that makes sense

619
00:28:33,868 --> 00:28:40,288
so from you know say like zero parts per

620
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:44,548
million to 2.5 so on and so forth to try

621
00:28:40,288 --> 00:28:48,589
and establish a curve for fertility as

622
00:28:44,548 --> 00:28:52,858
far as foliar analyses are concerned

623
00:28:48,589 --> 00:28:54,209
okay yeah that makes sense yeah I was

624
00:28:52,858 --> 00:28:56,178
just I was just kind of curious where

625
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:58,139
you came up with this for you know a

626
00:28:56,179 --> 00:29:00,028
baseline for your control because I

627
00:28:58,138 --> 00:29:03,569
think that's important for people to

628
00:29:00,028 --> 00:29:04,950
understand when you start talking about

629
00:29:03,569 --> 00:29:07,618
what you're removing it's good to know

630
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:10,979
where you were starting that's all okay

631
00:29:07,618 --> 00:29:12,839
I want to get into a little bit of the

632
00:29:10,979 --> 00:29:14,489
methodology here but just I had a couple

633
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:16,348
things in the introduction that you guys

634
00:29:14,489 --> 00:29:17,579
mentioned in terms of relating back to

635
00:29:16,348 --> 00:29:19,079
prior work that had been done that I

636
00:29:17,579 --> 00:29:20,788
thought was kind of interesting and I

637
00:29:19,079 --> 00:29:22,608
didn't know maybe it's something you can

638
00:29:20,788 --> 00:29:25,048
touch on maybe it's just something that

639
00:29:22,608 --> 00:29:26,368
pretty much the sentences that you put

640
00:29:25,048 --> 00:29:28,858
in there say at all but I kind of wanted

641
00:29:26,368 --> 00:29:31,168
to bring him bring him out in hemp

642
00:29:28,858 --> 00:29:31,528
forever in hemp fiber varieties Bosca

643
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:33,028
itaú

644
00:29:31,528 --> 00:29:35,038
reported higher levels of nitrogen

645
00:29:33,028 --> 00:29:38,009
increased plant leaf weight and

646
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:41,038
decreased leaf THC content presumably

647
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:46,108
due to THC dilution can you touch on

648
00:29:41,038 --> 00:29:48,569
that at all yeah so that work in

649
00:29:46,108 --> 00:29:50,939
particular like I said once when I

650
00:29:48,569 --> 00:29:52,319
actually went into this and was doing a

651
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:54,239
literature review and trying to get a

652
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:57,778
good feel for the kind of research that

653
00:29:54,239 --> 00:30:03,028
had been done there was not much out

654
00:29:57,778 --> 00:30:05,308
so this introduction is quite bare-bones

655
00:30:03,028 --> 00:30:08,729
when it comes to a normal introduction

656
00:30:05,308 --> 00:30:11,308
and literature review but essentially

657
00:30:08,729 --> 00:30:13,619
what we're trying to say there I think

658
00:30:11,308 --> 00:30:16,168
what the article was trying to get out

659
00:30:13,618 --> 00:30:17,278
is first I would like to draw your

660
00:30:16,169 --> 00:30:20,788
attention to the fact that this is a

661
00:30:17,278 --> 00:30:25,169
fiber variety so we were growing a high

662
00:30:20,788 --> 00:30:27,269
CBD clone so the growth habit and growth

663
00:30:25,169 --> 00:30:28,950
parameters are different for fiber

664
00:30:27,269 --> 00:30:30,479
varieties you want them to be very tall

665
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:32,308
you're trying to get you know plant them

666
00:30:30,479 --> 00:30:35,219
very densely they're in a field

667
00:30:32,308 --> 00:30:36,868
condition typically and the CBD variety

668
00:30:35,219 --> 00:30:39,239
is that we were growing you know you

669
00:30:36,868 --> 00:30:40,588
want those big beautiful flowers they're

670
00:30:39,239 --> 00:30:45,409
more compact they were grown in a

671
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:48,058
greenhouse but essentially what we're

672
00:30:45,409 --> 00:30:50,580
what we're trying to get out here is to

673
00:30:48,058 --> 00:30:54,088
draw on previous work showing that

674
00:30:50,579 --> 00:30:57,749
nitrogen increased the total production

675
00:30:54,088 --> 00:31:00,598
of leaf biomass and that's important

676
00:30:57,749 --> 00:31:03,598
when looking at leaf tissue analyses you

677
00:31:00,598 --> 00:31:06,628
know because you're comparing how much

678
00:31:03,598 --> 00:31:08,398
nitrogen is in that leaf it's a larger

679
00:31:06,628 --> 00:31:10,888
leaf you know you can potentially have a

680
00:31:08,398 --> 00:31:14,838
dilution effect and also that increased

681
00:31:10,888 --> 00:31:18,178
plant size could have resulted in a THC

682
00:31:14,838 --> 00:31:21,538
dilution effect so if you have a larger

683
00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:24,028
bud but the same amount of THC in it

684
00:31:21,538 --> 00:31:26,338
because most things are calculated off

685
00:31:24,028 --> 00:31:28,878
of a percentage dry weight you can have

686
00:31:26,338 --> 00:31:32,700
an artificially low dilution effect

687
00:31:28,878 --> 00:31:35,368
however I am unsure I can't recall off

688
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:39,359
the top of my head which methodology I

689
00:31:35,368 --> 00:31:41,668
actually used to test THC in this study

690
00:31:39,358 --> 00:31:44,038
whether it was a percentage dry weight

691
00:31:41,669 --> 00:31:46,619
or a percentage concentration so on and

692
00:31:44,038 --> 00:31:49,288
so forth that could be really

693
00:31:46,618 --> 00:31:51,749
interesting for people in growing hemp

694
00:31:49,288 --> 00:31:55,169
that are looking to stay below a given

695
00:31:51,749 --> 00:31:58,169
THC percentage in order to have a legal

696
00:31:55,169 --> 00:32:00,119
crop I'd be curious to see more research

697
00:31:58,169 --> 00:32:04,229
coming out on that around nitrogen

698
00:32:00,118 --> 00:32:05,819
levels yeah I would - any research at

699
00:32:04,229 --> 00:32:08,129
this point is just gonna help that

700
00:32:05,819 --> 00:32:09,838
additive scientific effect so that we

701
00:32:08,128 --> 00:32:11,699
can get a clearer picture for what's

702
00:32:09,838 --> 00:32:13,710
going on

703
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:14,850
okay so one thing one other thing I want

704
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:16,170
to ask you about was at the end of

705
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:18,299
introduction you mentioned that no

706
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:20,100
visual guides of nutrient deficiency in

707
00:32:18,299 --> 00:32:22,409
cannabis supported with leaf tissue

708
00:32:20,099 --> 00:32:24,869
analysis and documenting a progression

709
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:26,570
of symptoms II have been published so

710
00:32:24,869 --> 00:32:29,129
essentially what you're saying there is

711
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:31,559
when I go online on Google Images and

712
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:32,760
type in you know nitrogen deficiency

713
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:35,279
cannabis or whatever a particular

714
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:37,680
element I'm looking for there's no

715
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:40,170
research that's been published that

716
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:42,090
actually correlates that with a tissue

717
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:43,830
test the leaf tissue analysis to show

718
00:32:42,089 --> 00:32:44,759
that that truly is the deficiency is

719
00:32:43,829 --> 00:32:47,429
that correct

720
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:51,779
along with symptom ology so different

721
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:54,900
stages correct as far as I know and have

722
00:32:51,779 --> 00:32:56,819
seen and was able to tease out in the

723
00:32:54,900 --> 00:33:00,450
work that I did there have been some

724
00:32:56,819 --> 00:33:03,929
leaf tissue analyses reported I believe

725
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:06,440
the plant analysis handbook has tissue

726
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:09,600
values for cannabis sativa

727
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:13,789
but as far as correlating those visual

728
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:17,339
symptoms with an actual leaf tissue test

729
00:33:13,789 --> 00:33:19,289
and what I mean by actually correlating

730
00:33:17,339 --> 00:33:24,929
I don't mean just providing low

731
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:28,049
fertility when we withheld nitrogen from

732
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:31,380
the plant the plant received no nitrogen

733
00:33:28,049 --> 00:33:34,529
of any form so we can say with relative

734
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:38,240
certainty that the symptom ology that we

735
00:33:34,529 --> 00:33:41,730
saw based on the leaf tissue analysis is

736
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:44,849
truly nitrogen deficiency because the

737
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:48,450
plant received absolutely no nitrogen

738
00:33:44,849 --> 00:33:50,909
fertility well let's dive right into

739
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:52,470
nitrogen I'm not going to get into too

740
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:53,910
much into your methodology it's all

741
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:57,180
there in the paper people want to read

742
00:33:53,910 --> 00:34:00,420
it it's it seems fairly straightforward

743
00:33:57,180 --> 00:34:01,950
to me let's just talk about what your

744
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:03,890
findings were relating to nitrogen so

745
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:06,720
traditionally when you think of nitrogen

746
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:09,000
deficiencies you think of a yellowing on

747
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:11,070
the lower leaves the plants putting more

748
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,889
energy into its upper leaves lighter

749
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:16,019
greening over all of the plants what I

750
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:17,789
mean you have some actual photos here so

751
00:34:16,019 --> 00:34:19,889
people can see initial intermediate and

752
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:22,139
advanced stages of nitrogen deficiencies

753
00:34:19,889 --> 00:34:24,839
but can you talk about about those

754
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:28,849
findings relating in nitrogen

755
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:34,829
yeah so exploring nutrient deficiencies

756
00:34:28,849 --> 00:34:40,079
is kind of a fun I guess you could call

757
00:34:34,829 --> 00:34:43,199
it a bit of a puzzle certain elements

758
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:45,179
within plants are mobile and what that

759
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:48,000
means is the plant has the ability to

760
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:51,059
remove those from certain tissues and

761
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,940
portions and translocate them to other

762
00:34:51,059 --> 00:34:56,549
portions of the plant so for example

763
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:59,099
nitrogen is Noble so what that means is

764
00:34:56,550 --> 00:35:01,200
when the plant is nitrogen stressed it

765
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:03,449
will draw nitrogen from those lower

766
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:06,299
leaves which is why we kind of you know

767
00:35:03,449 --> 00:35:08,099
drew upon the fact that the symptom

768
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:10,800
ology developed first on the lower

769
00:35:08,099 --> 00:35:13,170
portion of the plant and it will

770
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:17,010
translate locate that to the you know

771
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:19,380
other portions of the plant that you

772
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:21,300
know need that nitrogen you know for

773
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:24,390
example the meristematic region as its

774
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:28,590
developing new leaves and putting on new

775
00:35:24,389 --> 00:35:31,589
shoots so and like you said typical

776
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:33,809
symptom ology of nitrogen deficiency is

777
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:37,170
going to be that yellowing or paling

778
00:35:33,809 --> 00:35:39,590
specifically at the lower foliage other

779
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:42,180
elements that we looked at you know are

780
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:45,329
immobile which means you're going to see

781
00:35:42,179 --> 00:35:50,069
symptomatology on the newer leaves

782
00:35:45,329 --> 00:35:51,329
shoots near portions of the plant yeah

783
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:54,360
that's a really good point regarding

784
00:35:51,329 --> 00:35:57,059
mobile and immobile nutrients how

785
00:35:54,360 --> 00:36:01,740
related is that to the hydrology in

786
00:35:57,059 --> 00:36:04,759
terms of your watering habits nutrient

787
00:36:01,739 --> 00:36:10,439
mobility or nutrients that are mobile

788
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:12,540
yeah so the the whole flow and dynamics

789
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:15,389
and flux of nutrients within the plant

790
00:36:12,539 --> 00:36:18,269
as is much more complicated than we went

791
00:36:15,389 --> 00:36:19,799
into in this paper like I said we're

792
00:36:18,269 --> 00:36:22,559
trying to get some more foundational

793
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:26,990
knowledge out there but yes so for

794
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:29,759
example some plants are Tran

795
00:36:26,989 --> 00:36:31,649
taken up by the plant through a process

796
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:36,690
called mass flow and that's very much

797
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:38,369
related to how much water essentially

798
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:41,309
the roots can

799
00:36:38,369 --> 00:36:43,920
into the plant and get those nutrients

800
00:36:41,309 --> 00:36:46,679
in and then there's other ways that the

801
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:49,769
plant can obtain nutrients scavenge

802
00:36:46,679 --> 00:36:52,949
nutrients etc so as far as through this

803
00:36:49,769 --> 00:36:55,199
study on all of the plants were on an

804
00:36:52,949 --> 00:36:59,399
automatic irrigation system and received

805
00:36:55,199 --> 00:37:02,399
the same amount of liquid at the same

806
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:05,039
intervals throughout the day the only

807
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,840
thing that changed was which nutrients

808
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:10,710
we were supplying to those plants in

809
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:12,870
that solution okay

810
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:14,929
and one of your one of the things I want

811
00:37:12,869 --> 00:37:18,119
to before we dive too far into any one

812
00:37:14,929 --> 00:37:20,639
element or nutrient here is in a

813
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:23,809
traditional cannabis growing environment

814
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:26,639
you're gonna see multiple symptoms

815
00:37:23,809 --> 00:37:28,739
typically it's not ever just a nitrogen

816
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:31,109
deficiency or a phosphorus deficiency

817
00:37:28,739 --> 00:37:32,819
it's usually related to your watering or

818
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:35,030
your environment community your

819
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:37,289
temperature your lighting intensity

820
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:40,530
insect pressure there's so many

821
00:37:37,289 --> 00:37:42,599
variables so I hope listeners will keep

822
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:45,000
that in mind when they're utilizing a

823
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:46,589
guide like this that it's not as simple

824
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,119
as just picking out one of the photos

825
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:50,160
and saying that looks the closest to

826
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:52,019
like my plant and so that's what's going

827
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:53,969
on you have to add a little more history

828
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:57,300
into how that plants being grown and

829
00:37:53,969 --> 00:37:58,879
what's going on in the room but just

830
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:00,240
want to throw in that little caveat so

831
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:02,220
sorry

832
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:04,289
getting back to it when you talk about

833
00:38:02,219 --> 00:38:05,849
nitrogen one of your findings was the

834
00:38:04,289 --> 00:38:08,250
plants growing in nitrogen deficient

835
00:38:05,849 --> 00:38:10,980
conditions produce 50% less biomass when

836
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:12,480
compared to the control I thought this

837
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:14,280
was an interesting finding I mean it

838
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,300
seems expected the plant doesn't have

839
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:18,630
nitrate it's not gonna be able to grow

840
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:19,950
as as efficiently but you didn't find

841
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:22,980
that across all of the different

842
00:38:19,949 --> 00:38:24,659
elements that you were testing with so

843
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:26,269
is there anything in relation to

844
00:38:24,659 --> 00:38:32,279
nitrogen that you want to touch on

845
00:38:26,269 --> 00:38:34,739
regarding that yeah so we have done

846
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:37,560
numerous nutrient efficiency studies

847
00:38:34,739 --> 00:38:41,459
with multiple different crops and this

848
00:38:37,559 --> 00:38:44,610
trend of dry weights being variable in

849
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:46,079
their statistical significance your kind

850
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:49,349
of holds true across most of those

851
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:52,319
studies a lot of it is just dependent

852
00:38:49,349 --> 00:38:55,409
upon the plan

853
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:57,360
and how they uptake nutrients how they

854
00:38:55,409 --> 00:38:59,099
utilize those nutrients their growth

855
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:01,829
habits you know you can imagine

856
00:38:59,099 --> 00:39:03,900
something that stays in a rosette form

857
00:39:01,829 --> 00:39:06,299
is going to have very different nutrient

858
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:09,389
needs and utilizations than something

859
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:12,360
that has a very upright and leggy growth

860
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:15,150
habits but as far as nitrogen is

861
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:17,579
concerned we expected to see a

862
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:20,570
statistical significance between no

863
00:39:17,579 --> 00:39:22,769
nitrogen and nitrogen supply treatments

864
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:25,380
specifically because nitrogen is a

865
00:39:22,769 --> 00:39:30,710
macronutrient and what that means is the

866
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:32,970
plant uses more nitrogen and other

867
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:35,579
macronutrients in greater quantities

868
00:39:32,969 --> 00:39:37,799
than say the micronutrients both macro

869
00:39:35,579 --> 00:39:41,389
and micro are still needed by the plants

870
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:45,140
but as far as the amounts that they need

871
00:39:41,389 --> 00:39:48,329
it means much much much more nitrogen

872
00:39:45,139 --> 00:39:51,000
than say the phosphorus or potassium or

873
00:39:48,329 --> 00:39:52,730
calcium and that's one of the reasons

874
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,619
why there was such a strong

875
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:59,630
statistically significant decrease in

876
00:39:55,619 --> 00:40:06,299
plant dry weight when compared to the

877
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:08,010
control now in this test you were just

878
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,970
dealing with vegetative plants correct

879
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:11,400
so you never really looked at

880
00:40:08,969 --> 00:40:14,669
cannabinoid content THC percentage any

881
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:16,710
of those things is that correct that is

882
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:20,159
correct the current work that we're

883
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:22,829
doing we are looking at like I said the

884
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:25,559
nutrient rates for all macro and micro

885
00:40:22,829 --> 00:40:28,860
nutrients across the plants different

886
00:40:25,559 --> 00:40:32,519
life stages so the experiment that we

887
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:35,070
are doing now we're looking at leaf

888
00:40:32,519 --> 00:40:38,159
tissue nutrient concentrations in the

889
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:41,760
vegetative state we then again sample

890
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:44,219
once we have turned off our lighting and

891
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:48,090
initiated those shorter days to start

892
00:40:44,219 --> 00:40:49,829
flowering and we harvest at pre flower

893
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:52,019
which is typically a week to two weeks

894
00:40:49,829 --> 00:40:54,630
after we shut our lights off and then

895
00:40:52,019 --> 00:40:56,670
we're waiting until they go into full

896
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:59,490
flower maturity which we're targeting

897
00:40:56,670 --> 00:41:01,590
about eight weeks for full flower

898
00:40:59,489 --> 00:41:03,859
maturity and then we're again sampling

899
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:06,079
leaf tissue so we're getting this nice

900
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:09,200
not only nutrient

901
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:12,349
rate curve but also total plant life

902
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:14,799
cycle and how the nutrients are changing

903
00:41:12,349 --> 00:41:17,960
accumulating moving within the plant

904
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:20,510
this isn't an uptake study or a

905
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:24,920
translocation study it's a nutrient rate

906
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:26,630
study over time but like I said there's

907
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:29,539
this additive effect so that's kind of

908
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:32,090
the next step that we're going on to so

909
00:41:29,539 --> 00:41:35,779
on and so forth yeah I think that'll be

910
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:37,940
really interesting because it's it's

911
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:41,180
fairly easy I think to grow a healthy

912
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:43,010
vegetative cannabis plant but as you get

913
00:41:41,179 --> 00:41:44,769
further into flower as the plant starts

914
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:47,840
senesce Inge

915
00:41:44,769 --> 00:41:50,869
you see any particular stress I think

916
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:52,640
becomes much much more apparent so even

917
00:41:50,869 --> 00:41:55,009
though as we move through some of these

918
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:57,309
elements in your in your study here and

919
00:41:55,010 --> 00:42:00,050
you said you note that there isn't

920
00:41:57,309 --> 00:42:03,079
statistical significance in biomass I

921
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:04,820
think as we move into flower that'll

922
00:42:03,079 --> 00:42:08,509
become a lot more apparent in terms of

923
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:12,620
the those deficiencies reflecting either

924
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:16,130
a loss of THC or cannabinoid percentages

925
00:42:12,619 --> 00:42:19,819
or terpene values or even overall yield

926
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:22,610
of flower biomass so I'm really excited

927
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:26,059
to see that work as you guys come out

928
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:28,000
with it yeah and kind of going back to

929
00:42:26,059 --> 00:42:31,099
what you're saying with the

930
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:35,840
statistically not the statistical non

931
00:42:31,099 --> 00:42:38,059
significance in the plant dry weights so

932
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:40,460
for example for phosphorus while we did

933
00:42:38,059 --> 00:42:43,309
not see a statistical significance and

934
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:45,320
rank the weight between the plants that

935
00:42:43,309 --> 00:42:48,679
did not receive phosphorus versus the

936
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:51,110
plants that did you can look at the leaf

937
00:42:48,679 --> 00:42:53,179
tissue values and see that they were

938
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:55,670
statistically significant and very

939
00:42:53,179 --> 00:42:58,339
statistically significant actually so

940
00:42:55,670 --> 00:43:00,590
even though that phosphorus treatment

941
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:03,200
may not have produced a smaller plant

942
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:05,300
per per se it definitely had less

943
00:43:03,199 --> 00:43:07,299
phosphorus which means that it will be

944
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:09,880
stressed and won't be as healthy and

945
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:16,300
consequently could potentially produce

946
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:18,260
you know a bud that would be suboptimal

947
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:20,420
sure that makes sense

948
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:23,960
and you know I'm of the opinion that

949
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:27,079
most most growers over apply phosphorus

950
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:32,000
in flower I'd be curious are you going

951
00:43:27,079 --> 00:43:35,869
to look at what sort of what sufficient

952
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:38,840
sea levels are needed for phosphorus in

953
00:43:35,869 --> 00:43:41,239
flower versus the overabundance that I

954
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:43,579
think is applied throughout the cannabis

955
00:43:41,239 --> 00:43:49,729
industry in general when it comes to

956
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:52,009
phosphorus yeah so one of the things

957
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:55,099
that we'll be looking at is when we take

958
00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:57,590
that final leaf tissue harvest so we're

959
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:59,809
going to be looking at okay at the end

960
00:43:57,590 --> 00:44:02,870
of the plant's life how much phosphorus

961
00:43:59,809 --> 00:44:05,029
did it accumulate over these different

962
00:44:02,869 --> 00:44:08,599
rates but then we will also be looking

963
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:12,140
at cannabinoids cannabinoids however you

964
00:44:08,599 --> 00:44:17,059
want to say it and how that can

965
00:44:12,139 --> 00:44:20,029
potentially relate back to the different

966
00:44:17,059 --> 00:44:24,170
rates that we're applying so for example

967
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:27,670
in our phosphorus provided at let's say

968
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:32,690
hypothetically ten parts per million

969
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:36,230
what would that bud total dry mass be

970
00:44:32,690 --> 00:44:41,860
but then what would also be the you know

971
00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:43,760
level of THC or CBD CBG in that flower

972
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:45,680
very cool I can't wait to see that

973
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:49,070
research that's I think really exciting

974
00:44:45,679 --> 00:44:50,750
I would love to have you back on once

975
00:44:49,070 --> 00:44:53,150
you have you know gotten a little

976
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:54,070
further along and published that yeah

977
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:58,670
we'd love to

978
00:44:54,070 --> 00:45:00,110
we'd love to do that cool so let's let's

979
00:44:58,670 --> 00:45:01,550
move on to calcium it looks like that's

980
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:03,920
the next nutrient that you talked about

981
00:45:01,550 --> 00:45:07,280
here I did notice that you put in

982
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:10,090
dolomite lime into your substrate to get

983
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:12,650
some calcium and magnesium in there

984
00:45:10,090 --> 00:45:13,970
Keith can you touch on that and then

985
00:45:12,650 --> 00:45:21,099
also what your findings were with

986
00:45:13,969 --> 00:45:24,049
calcium yeah absolutely so for the

987
00:45:21,099 --> 00:45:26,269
rooting substrate that we use because

988
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:27,940
these were vegetative cuttings yes some

989
00:45:26,269 --> 00:45:32,059
of that did have the limited climb

990
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:34,119
amended in it but those levels would be

991
00:45:32,059 --> 00:45:37,009
negligible on the scale that we're

992
00:45:34,119 --> 00:45:39,499
looking at especially as the plants

993
00:45:37,009 --> 00:45:41,659
continue to grow and there's you know

994
00:45:39,498 --> 00:45:44,509
more biomass and consequently less

995
00:45:41,659 --> 00:45:46,848
calcium and you can see that in the

996
00:45:44,509 --> 00:45:48,739
statistically significant results from

997
00:45:46,849 --> 00:45:52,999
the leaf tissue concentration that we

998
00:45:48,739 --> 00:45:56,208
saw but as far as symptomology for

999
00:45:52,998 --> 00:45:58,368
calcium goes calcium is an immobile

1000
00:45:56,208 --> 00:46:00,618
element so when you're looking to see

1001
00:45:58,369 --> 00:46:02,059
calcium stress or deficiency on your

1002
00:46:00,619 --> 00:46:04,039
plants you're going to be looking at the

1003
00:46:02,059 --> 00:46:06,259
growing tips the newly expanded leaves

1004
00:46:04,039 --> 00:46:09,410
the portions of the plants that are

1005
00:46:06,259 --> 00:46:11,449
actively growing and expanding so

1006
00:46:09,409 --> 00:46:14,389
calcium the plant isn't able to

1007
00:46:11,449 --> 00:46:16,219
requisition any calcium reserves from

1008
00:46:14,389 --> 00:46:17,808
old cells or old plant parts and

1009
00:46:16,219 --> 00:46:20,979
translocated so that's why you're

1010
00:46:17,809 --> 00:46:23,930
looking at these new portions and

1011
00:46:20,978 --> 00:46:29,528
another thing with calcium is that it's

1012
00:46:23,929 --> 00:46:33,288
involved in cell wall stability and

1013
00:46:29,528 --> 00:46:35,329
basically what happens when a plant goes

1014
00:46:33,289 --> 00:46:38,839
through a calcium deficiency is it

1015
00:46:35,329 --> 00:46:42,890
cannot adequately develop so you'll see

1016
00:46:38,838 --> 00:46:44,958
this severe distortion and stunting that

1017
00:46:42,889 --> 00:46:48,228
we saw and you can see in the photos as

1018
00:46:44,958 --> 00:46:50,178
they progress and that's one of the

1019
00:46:48,228 --> 00:46:54,409
reasons that we were able to see such

1020
00:46:50,179 --> 00:46:55,699
beautiful I say beautiful but if you're

1021
00:46:54,409 --> 00:46:57,588
seeing the symptomology it's not

1022
00:46:55,699 --> 00:47:00,139
beautiful when it grow up

1023
00:46:57,588 --> 00:47:02,958
but beautiful symptomology that we

1024
00:47:00,139 --> 00:47:06,379
induced it's quite dramatic it's it's

1025
00:47:02,958 --> 00:47:07,788
very apparent which i think is is what

1026
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:09,108
you're referring to there and it is

1027
00:47:07,789 --> 00:47:12,890
great to see and you can't see it it

1028
00:47:09,108 --> 00:47:15,489
just it almost looks like it had a lot

1029
00:47:12,889 --> 00:47:18,588
of light stress I think in a lot of ways

1030
00:47:15,489 --> 00:47:19,880
it's it's I was quite shocked with just

1031
00:47:18,588 --> 00:47:22,130
how dramatic it is because it's funny

1032
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:24,920
because in the in the cannabis industry

1033
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:28,338
there's sort of this old mantra that if

1034
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:30,409
your plant looks at all sick or

1035
00:47:28,338 --> 00:47:32,150
deficient you just apply Cal meg and

1036
00:47:30,409 --> 00:47:33,379
it's kind of become a running joke in

1037
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:35,358
the cannabis industry I've just you know

1038
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:39,048
put more Cal mag on that product but in

1039
00:47:35,358 --> 00:47:40,938
reality I think it's rare we see these

1040
00:47:39,048 --> 00:47:43,969
sorts of calcium deficiencies that they

1041
00:47:40,938 --> 00:47:45,170
do occur at least I don't see them as

1042
00:47:43,969 --> 00:47:46,780
much with the

1043
00:47:45,170 --> 00:47:50,829
that I work with I tend to see more

1044
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:53,210
nitrogen or potassium deficiencies but

1045
00:47:50,829 --> 00:47:56,780
yeah I really liked seeing those photos

1046
00:47:53,210 --> 00:47:57,949
so that was really great to see was

1047
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:58,880
there anything else about calcium that

1048
00:47:57,949 --> 00:48:01,039
you wanted to add I love that you're

1049
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:03,140
kind of describing a little bit of how

1050
00:48:01,039 --> 00:48:04,548
these nutrients work in a plant because

1051
00:48:03,139 --> 00:48:08,900
I think that's really important so I

1052
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:10,190
appreciate that too what if you're okay

1053
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:12,920
with it let's move on to sulphur and you

1054
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:15,139
can talk a little about that too yeah

1055
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:18,289
I'd like to touch on one more thing on

1056
00:48:15,139 --> 00:48:20,629
calcium real quick okay so calcium and

1057
00:48:18,289 --> 00:48:22,009
boron will have very similar symptom

1058
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:26,690
ology and they're both in mobile

1059
00:48:22,010 --> 00:48:29,710
elements but one of the reasons and we

1060
00:48:26,690 --> 00:48:32,929
have completed the micronutrients

1061
00:48:29,710 --> 00:48:35,150
experiment run for that nutrient rates

1062
00:48:32,929 --> 00:48:36,679
by lifecycle portion so I can talk a

1063
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:40,039
little bit about some of the symptom

1064
00:48:36,679 --> 00:48:41,539
ology and results not true results yet

1065
00:48:40,039 --> 00:48:46,880
we haven't run statistics on the full

1066
00:48:41,539 --> 00:48:48,920
study but because cannabis wants it

1067
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:50,900
initiates its reproductive phase that

1068
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:54,139
growing tip will become the flowering

1069
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:56,900
portion calcium and boron are extremely

1070
00:48:54,139 --> 00:49:01,608
important in that development because

1071
00:48:56,900 --> 00:49:03,230
you know when they finally are initiate

1072
00:49:01,608 --> 00:49:05,449
the reproductive cycle and start

1073
00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:08,119
producing that flower bud it's going to

1074
00:49:05,449 --> 00:49:10,699
be at that growing tip that you see

1075
00:49:08,119 --> 00:49:13,608
across the plant so if you do have

1076
00:49:10,699 --> 00:49:15,769
calcium or boron deficiencies you will

1077
00:49:13,608 --> 00:49:17,539
not have a properly developing flower

1078
00:49:15,769 --> 00:49:21,230
bud because you won't have a properly

1079
00:49:17,539 --> 00:49:24,230
developing an expanding growing region

1080
00:49:21,230 --> 00:49:28,068
and so you know we saw that with our

1081
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:33,039
boron plants you know we had almost no

1082
00:49:28,068 --> 00:49:36,139
flowers produced on our boron zero rate

1083
00:49:33,039 --> 00:49:38,989
once we initiated flowering just because

1084
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:41,389
there the plant was physiologically

1085
00:49:38,989 --> 00:49:44,179
incapable of expanding and growing

1086
00:49:41,389 --> 00:49:46,909
because it did not have the structural

1087
00:49:44,179 --> 00:49:51,019
components needed to build those cells

1088
00:49:46,909 --> 00:49:53,000
and expand those cells that's really

1089
00:49:51,019 --> 00:49:56,539
interesting and people can go and view

1090
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:58,909
these photos to see what what Paul is

1091
00:49:56,539 --> 00:50:00,588
describing here on on

1092
00:49:58,909 --> 00:50:01,818
paper itself there's some great photos

1093
00:50:00,588 --> 00:50:05,389
associated with every one of these

1094
00:50:01,818 --> 00:50:08,449
elements yeah so you wanted to move on

1095
00:50:05,389 --> 00:50:09,500
to sulfur next is that correct yeah

1096
00:50:08,449 --> 00:50:11,710
we'll just keep working our way through

1097
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:16,460
I think this is great thank you

1098
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:21,889
wonderful yeah so for sulfur again it

1099
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:24,769
was one of those elements where we did

1100
00:50:21,889 --> 00:50:28,298
not see a statistically significant

1101
00:50:24,769 --> 00:50:30,588
difference in the dry weight between the

1102
00:50:28,298 --> 00:50:33,769
plants that did not receive any sulfur

1103
00:50:30,588 --> 00:50:34,940
versus the control however when you

1104
00:50:33,769 --> 00:50:38,210
actually look at the leaf tissue

1105
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:41,539
concentration it was statistically

1106
00:50:38,210 --> 00:50:44,630
significant so the plants that received

1107
00:50:41,539 --> 00:50:48,160
no sulfur had much much lower leaf

1108
00:50:44,630 --> 00:50:53,030
tissue concentrations than plants that

1109
00:50:48,159 --> 00:50:56,029
received an adequate level of sulfur

1110
00:50:53,030 --> 00:50:58,069
fertility and again I want to kind of go

1111
00:50:56,030 --> 00:51:00,769
back to what you said a bit earlier on

1112
00:50:58,068 --> 00:51:04,219
you know making sure that you take a

1113
00:51:00,769 --> 00:51:07,338
holistic approach to diagnostics in your

1114
00:51:04,219 --> 00:51:10,759
plants you know I that was great that he

1115
00:51:07,338 --> 00:51:13,639
said that leaf tissue analysis is just

1116
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:15,950
one way of trying to tease out problems

1117
00:51:13,639 --> 00:51:17,420
that you may experience you know it's

1118
00:51:15,949 --> 00:51:18,828
like you said it's this holistic

1119
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:21,740
approach that you have to take it could

1120
00:51:18,829 --> 00:51:24,559
be another abiotic stress you know it

1121
00:51:21,739 --> 00:51:28,129
could be ozone damage it could be water

1122
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:30,680
stress you know so taking those leaf

1123
00:51:28,130 --> 00:51:32,809
tissue concentrations from your plant

1124
00:51:30,679 --> 00:51:35,989
actually going in taking the leaf tissue

1125
00:51:32,809 --> 00:51:37,960
samples sending it off to a lab ensuring

1126
00:51:35,989 --> 00:51:40,308
that you can do that and that the lab is

1127
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:42,079
licensed and that the laws and

1128
00:51:40,309 --> 00:51:44,930
legalities in your state allow you to do

1129
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:47,568
that to gain this information will be

1130
00:51:44,929 --> 00:51:50,419
extremely valuable if you think you have

1131
00:51:47,568 --> 00:51:53,900
a nutrient deficiency you always want to

1132
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:56,588
go that extra step if possible and check

1133
00:51:53,900 --> 00:52:02,769
to ensure that what you're seeing

1134
00:51:56,588 --> 00:52:05,980
visually is also reflected in the plant

1135
00:52:02,769 --> 00:52:08,509
yeah that's an interesting topic because

1136
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:11,599
because cannabis is federally illegal we

1137
00:52:08,510 --> 00:52:12,170
cannot ship any leaf samples even if

1138
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:14,720
there have a bed

1139
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:17,568
a plant with zero THC content in the

1140
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:19,009
mail so most cannabis facilities are

1141
00:52:17,568 --> 00:52:22,308
very limited in their ability to do

1142
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:25,520
tissue testing so a lot of what we do is

1143
00:52:22,309 --> 00:52:28,548
sow testing because we're primarily

1144
00:52:25,519 --> 00:52:31,818
working with organic soil growers where

1145
00:52:28,548 --> 00:52:35,509
we where we have certain levels of

1146
00:52:31,818 --> 00:52:37,460
mineral content in every soil mix that

1147
00:52:35,510 --> 00:52:38,690
we're working with in native soil and

1148
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:40,579
then it's just a matter of trying to

1149
00:52:38,690 --> 00:52:44,568
balance those based off of like a male

1150
00:52:40,579 --> 00:52:46,280
ik3 test which is not ideal I'm fully

1151
00:52:44,568 --> 00:52:50,269
aware of that but it's one of the limit

1152
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:52,579
limitations within the cannabis research

1153
00:52:50,269 --> 00:52:55,239
at least from a facility perspective

1154
00:52:52,579 --> 00:52:58,880
because we are limited not only just in

1155
00:52:55,239 --> 00:53:00,588
the ability to mail leaf samples to

1156
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:02,180
reach a lab to even find a lab that's

1157
00:53:00,588 --> 00:53:03,798
willing to look at a cannabis sample and

1158
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:07,068
then also just the cost associated with

1159
00:53:03,798 --> 00:53:10,250
testing for businesses is is really

1160
00:53:07,068 --> 00:53:12,889
tough so it's great that the university

1161
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:16,280
is doing work like this to at least

1162
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:19,338
allow growers to have access to some of

1163
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:22,579
this information yeah that's that's a

1164
00:53:19,338 --> 00:53:24,858
great insight and again you know we're

1165
00:53:22,579 --> 00:53:28,490
we're learning as much as we possibly

1166
00:53:24,858 --> 00:53:30,409
can so honestly the exchanges that we

1167
00:53:28,489 --> 00:53:32,000
get with growers and the kind of

1168
00:53:30,409 --> 00:53:34,730
challenges that they're experiencing it

1169
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:36,909
only helps us do better research so who

1170
00:53:34,730 --> 00:53:40,219
knows maybe down the road we're going to

1171
00:53:36,909 --> 00:53:41,539
look at possibly correlating some of you

1172
00:53:40,219 --> 00:53:44,419
know the nutrient work that we're doing

1173
00:53:41,539 --> 00:53:47,239
to you know some of those soil tests I

1174
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:49,639
know that there's researchers out there

1175
00:53:47,239 --> 00:53:53,239
who do a lot of work with that and I

1176
00:53:49,639 --> 00:53:56,989
think they jump at the opportunity to do

1177
00:53:53,239 --> 00:53:58,219
some work like that if it's needed yeah

1178
00:53:56,989 --> 00:53:59,719
that'd be great I mean I'd love to see

1179
00:53:58,219 --> 00:54:01,519
more correlation there between like the

1180
00:53:59,719 --> 00:54:03,919
may like three and saturated pace tests

1181
00:54:01,519 --> 00:54:08,389
with these tissue tests so we can have a

1182
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:10,548
better idea of how we're of nutrient

1183
00:54:08,389 --> 00:54:12,019
availability in these soils because the

1184
00:54:10,548 --> 00:54:13,460
other challenge there too is how much of

1185
00:54:12,019 --> 00:54:15,949
those those nutrients are really

1186
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:18,019
available to a plant and and how well is

1187
00:54:15,949 --> 00:54:18,889
the biology it's cycling those nutrients

1188
00:54:18,019 --> 00:54:20,690
so if we're talking about organic

1189
00:54:18,889 --> 00:54:24,849
systems there's so many variables

1190
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:26,409
involved it gets quite complex

1191
00:54:24,849 --> 00:54:30,339
I think it's gonna be a long time before

1192
00:54:26,409 --> 00:54:33,099
we have all those answers but by using

1193
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:34,360
you know chemical nutrients or mineral

1194
00:54:33,099 --> 00:54:37,019
salts like you guys are you're really

1195
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:39,640
able to isolate out these various

1196
00:54:37,019 --> 00:54:41,469
minerals or nutrients which really makes

1197
00:54:39,639 --> 00:54:43,659
a difference in seeing these these

1198
00:54:41,469 --> 00:54:46,750
symptoms so that we can we can still

1199
00:54:43,659 --> 00:54:49,299
apply some of this knowledge towards you

1200
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:54,250
know are more complex organic soil

1201
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:56,320
systems yeah the one thing I will say

1202
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:58,030
with sulfur that I see is I tend to see

1203
00:54:56,320 --> 00:55:00,460
it in very high levels and organic soils

1204
00:54:58,030 --> 00:55:03,100
primarily because people either applying

1205
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:05,769
sulfates or gypsum as a way of

1206
00:55:03,099 --> 00:55:09,819
mitigating the alkalinity of a lot of

1207
00:55:05,769 --> 00:55:11,590
the cations in in soils so I tend to see

1208
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:14,019
like excessively high sulfur levels

1209
00:55:11,590 --> 00:55:15,340
however from all the research I found

1210
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:18,940
it's very hard to reach sulfur

1211
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:21,100
toxicities in soils or more specifically

1212
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:23,349
in cannabis plants to where I haven't

1213
00:55:21,099 --> 00:55:25,679
really seen it be a big issue it's been

1214
00:55:23,349 --> 00:55:29,259
one of the best tools for lowering pH

1215
00:55:25,679 --> 00:55:30,819
that I've found in soils is anything you

1216
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:36,190
want to add you mean you would touch on

1217
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:42,690
regarding that comment yeah it's very

1218
00:55:36,190 --> 00:55:45,490
difficult to produce a sulfur toxicity

1219
00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:49,380
and without going too much into the

1220
00:55:45,489 --> 00:55:53,549
details of physiology of that

1221
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:56,829
essentially the plant is very good at

1222
00:55:53,550 --> 00:56:00,010
requisitioning utilizing or excluding

1223
00:55:56,829 --> 00:56:03,400
sulfur within the soil one thing that

1224
00:56:00,010 --> 00:56:05,650
you can see and some things that have

1225
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:07,480
come out of literature is that elevated

1226
00:56:05,650 --> 00:56:10,480
sulfur level is just like any other

1227
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:13,590
element being elevated above others in

1228
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:16,240
the soil profile can potentially impact

1229
00:56:13,590 --> 00:56:19,769
and I will call it qualify that by

1230
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:22,779
saying can potentially impact the

1231
00:56:19,769 --> 00:56:24,639
microbial community and especially in

1232
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:28,540
say an organic system like what you're

1233
00:56:24,639 --> 00:56:31,690
working with you know looking at how

1234
00:56:28,539 --> 00:56:33,309
those microbes can take those nutrients

1235
00:56:31,690 --> 00:56:36,039
and turn them into you know a

1236
00:56:33,309 --> 00:56:38,019
mineralized core form that is plants

1237
00:56:36,039 --> 00:56:40,059
available you know that relation

1238
00:56:38,019 --> 00:56:42,550
[ __ ] between the organic matter the

1239
00:56:40,059 --> 00:56:45,099
microbes and then the production of

1240
00:56:42,550 --> 00:56:49,260
those mineral plant available forms is a

1241
00:56:45,099 --> 00:56:52,719
very important Network and web to be

1242
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:55,980
maintaining and monitoring so down the

1243
00:56:52,719 --> 00:56:59,289
road maybe there could be more work done

1244
00:56:55,980 --> 00:57:02,500
specifically with regard to microbes and

1245
00:56:59,289 --> 00:57:06,159
say elevated sulfur levels and nutrient

1246
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:07,510
cycling and organic systems yeah it was

1247
00:57:06,159 --> 00:57:10,179
really what I would like to see

1248
00:57:07,510 --> 00:57:12,880
regarding sulfur is information on how

1249
00:57:10,179 --> 00:57:16,359
sulfur impacts of biology cuz when we

1250
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:17,710
talk about sulfur it comes in a lot of

1251
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:19,720
different forms so when we talk about a

1252
00:57:17,710 --> 00:57:22,630
sulfate form or it's you know we talked

1253
00:57:19,719 --> 00:57:25,209
about potassium sulfate calcium sulfate

1254
00:57:22,630 --> 00:57:28,570
in the case of gypsum it appears to have

1255
00:57:25,210 --> 00:57:30,699
in this is anecdotal very little minor

1256
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:32,769
impact on overall soil biology and

1257
00:57:30,699 --> 00:57:34,839
nutrient cycling but I've heard when

1258
00:57:32,769 --> 00:57:38,110
using agricultural so for which is

1259
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:40,240
associated with lowering pH it can have

1260
00:57:38,110 --> 00:57:42,280
a more dramatic input impact on soil

1261
00:57:40,239 --> 00:57:44,079
biology but I haven't I haven't seen

1262
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:46,890
enough research and I haven't seen

1263
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:49,599
enough data to really show how much

1264
00:57:46,889 --> 00:57:53,889
sulfur would need to be added to lower a

1265
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:56,529
pH level this much in a given volume of

1266
00:57:53,889 --> 00:57:58,029
soil and how that impacts so about those

1267
00:57:56,530 --> 00:57:59,740
are things that I would love answers to

1268
00:57:58,030 --> 00:58:00,910
down the road or if that research exists

1269
00:57:59,739 --> 00:58:04,389
someone send it to me because I haven't

1270
00:58:00,909 --> 00:58:06,670
seen it yeah some research like that one

1271
00:58:04,389 --> 00:58:09,839
would be fantastic especially with

1272
00:58:06,670 --> 00:58:12,789
regards to organic forms of sulfur

1273
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:17,829
there's like you said there's definitely

1274
00:58:12,789 --> 00:58:20,050
very much need for more information to

1275
00:58:17,829 --> 00:58:24,489
help perpetuate that adequate of

1276
00:58:20,050 --> 00:58:26,110
scientific process okay but let's go

1277
00:58:24,489 --> 00:58:28,539
back and and why don't you tell us a

1278
00:58:26,110 --> 00:58:30,900
little bit more about magnesium I know I

1279
00:58:28,539 --> 00:58:35,860
got off topic there for a second

1280
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:40,260
yes so magnesium deficiency magnesium is

1281
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:44,410
involved with chlorophyll and

1282
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:46,360
essentially what a plant will when a

1283
00:58:44,409 --> 00:58:48,309
plant experiences magnesium deficiency

1284
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:50,960
chlorophyll essentially doesn't function

1285
00:58:48,309 --> 00:58:54,139
in the way that it's supposed to

1286
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:56,150
and what that means for the plant is if

1287
00:58:54,139 --> 00:58:58,039
you have a magnesium deficiency the

1288
00:58:56,150 --> 00:59:01,309
photosynthetic activity of the plant

1289
00:58:58,039 --> 00:59:04,699
could be much lower and that will impact

1290
00:59:01,309 --> 00:59:07,849
the resources and photosynthate that the

1291
00:59:04,699 --> 00:59:11,539
plant has and is able to then throw at

1292
00:59:07,849 --> 00:59:14,180
the developing bud and other developing

1293
00:59:11,539 --> 00:59:17,199
portions of the plant so if you think

1294
00:59:14,179 --> 00:59:20,118
about it and a typical life cycle you

1295
00:59:17,199 --> 00:59:23,118
know every organism wants to reproduce

1296
00:59:20,119 --> 00:59:27,200
and especially in plants as you touched

1297
00:59:23,119 --> 00:59:29,829
on a lot of times with the reproductive

1298
00:59:27,199 --> 00:59:33,588
stage of the plant you'll experience

1299
00:59:29,829 --> 00:59:34,969
much more pronounced stressors and that

1300
00:59:33,588 --> 00:59:36,559
will be when you start seeing those

1301
00:59:34,969 --> 00:59:38,509
symptom ologies for nutrient

1302
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:39,769
deficiencies over you know other

1303
00:59:38,510 --> 00:59:42,020
stresses that the plant may be

1304
00:59:39,769 --> 00:59:44,480
experiencing because it's dumping so

1305
00:59:42,019 --> 00:59:47,509
many of those resources into that

1306
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:50,990
developing flower bud with the end goal

1307
00:59:47,510 --> 00:59:57,160
of trying to reproduce and so especially

1308
00:59:50,989 --> 01:00:00,889
my magnesium you can potentially have

1309
00:59:57,159 --> 01:00:02,899
huge impacts to your yield and again

1310
01:00:00,889 --> 01:00:05,838
like I said we have not explored the

1311
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:11,019
full rates and life cycle analysis yet

1312
01:00:05,838 --> 01:00:13,730
of this element throughout the plant but

1313
01:00:11,019 --> 01:00:17,059
it's one of those that you want to keep

1314
01:00:13,730 --> 01:00:18,139
a specific eye on given its importance

1315
01:00:17,059 --> 01:00:22,099
to plant health overall

1316
01:00:18,139 --> 01:00:25,819
and then also touching on the the

1317
01:00:22,099 --> 01:00:29,119
symptomology by location on the leaf and

1318
01:00:25,820 --> 01:00:31,280
how it develops and progresses like you

1319
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:33,619
said they're very similar magnesium and

1320
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:37,130
potassium deficiency symptoms are very

1321
01:00:33,619 --> 01:00:39,920
similar and so understanding that leaf

1322
01:00:37,130 --> 01:00:42,920
anatomy and how it progresses you know

1323
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:45,710
is important in the visual diagnostic

1324
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:50,108
checklist that you kind of go through

1325
01:00:45,710 --> 01:00:53,179
and obviously in an ideal world we would

1326
01:00:50,108 --> 01:00:56,710
identify a nutrient deficiency early

1327
01:00:53,179 --> 01:00:59,539
before it gets to these advanced stages

1328
01:00:56,710 --> 01:01:02,059
so that you know we don't have to wait

1329
01:00:59,539 --> 01:01:04,219
until it we see advanced entomology to

1330
01:01:02,059 --> 01:01:06,759
determine you know magnesium versus

1331
01:01:04,219 --> 01:01:08,569
potassium

1332
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:11,540
yeah now I'm excited to talk about

1333
01:01:08,570 --> 01:01:14,510
potassium because I think potassium is

1334
01:01:11,539 --> 01:01:17,690
one of the most important elements when

1335
01:01:14,510 --> 01:01:20,330
we're talking about cannabis and I don't

1336
01:01:17,690 --> 01:01:23,539
have the data to support this yet at

1337
01:01:20,329 --> 01:01:26,150
least I mean I have you know hundreds of

1338
01:01:23,539 --> 01:01:28,420
soil tests I've looked at relative to

1339
01:01:26,150 --> 01:01:30,889
overall plant growth but they're not I

1340
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:34,460
haven't had any plant tissue analysis

1341
01:01:30,889 --> 01:01:38,989
but the trend that I think I'm seeing is

1342
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:43,519
that potassium deficiencies occur at a

1343
01:01:38,989 --> 01:01:46,309
much higher rate in cannabis as in they

1344
01:01:43,519 --> 01:01:49,550
need more potassium than most

1345
01:01:46,309 --> 01:01:54,440
agricultural crops and I think potassium

1346
01:01:49,550 --> 01:01:58,220
has a high correlation with bud density

1347
01:01:54,440 --> 01:02:02,210
and overall weight so essentially

1348
01:01:58,219 --> 01:02:05,539
talking yield based on the soil tests

1349
01:02:02,210 --> 01:02:07,190
that I see correlating with plants the

1350
01:02:05,539 --> 01:02:10,219
plants that appear to be our soils that

1351
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:12,610
appear to be K deficient or even just

1352
01:02:10,219 --> 01:02:19,279
case sufficient like barely sufficient

1353
01:02:12,610 --> 01:02:22,340
tend to produce lower yield and lower

1354
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:24,380
weight yeah lower weight and overall

1355
01:02:22,340 --> 01:02:27,350
lower yield and lower bud density than

1356
01:02:24,380 --> 01:02:29,960
these then plants that have what most we

1357
01:02:27,349 --> 01:02:32,900
consider an excess of potassium but I'd

1358
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:34,369
be curious to have you talk on it and

1359
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:38,950
also talk about what your findings were

1360
01:02:34,369 --> 01:02:41,809
with potassium in this particular paper

1361
01:02:38,949 --> 01:02:45,589
yeah so the interesting thing about

1362
01:02:41,809 --> 01:02:49,549
potassium especially with regards to on

1363
01:02:45,590 --> 01:02:51,740
say a soil profile as opposed to some of

1364
01:02:49,550 --> 01:02:55,160
the you know soluble fertilizers that we

1365
01:02:51,739 --> 01:03:00,469
were using here is it's a mono valent

1366
01:02:55,159 --> 01:03:03,199
ion which means it's charge is it

1367
01:03:00,469 --> 01:03:07,069
essentially has a charge positive charge

1368
01:03:03,199 --> 01:03:09,589
a singular positive charge so typically

1369
01:03:07,070 --> 01:03:12,980
what happens say you have a heavy rain

1370
01:03:09,590 --> 01:03:15,289
event those mono valent ions will be

1371
01:03:12,980 --> 01:03:18,329
leached through the soil profile they're

1372
01:03:15,289 --> 01:03:21,659
readily then say you're diving Lent

1373
01:03:18,329 --> 01:03:27,389
and so that means that potassium can

1374
01:03:21,659 --> 01:03:29,389
move into a plant relatively easily but

1375
01:03:27,389 --> 01:03:33,539
it also moves through the soil profile

1376
01:03:29,389 --> 01:03:36,629
relatively easily as well but that's

1377
01:03:33,539 --> 01:03:39,690
kind of a side note and as far as the

1378
01:03:36,630 --> 01:03:42,329
research findings that we found we also

1379
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:48,150
found that you know limiting potassium

1380
01:03:42,329 --> 01:03:49,679
had a huge impact on the the obviously

1381
01:03:48,150 --> 01:03:52,050
it had an impact on how much potassium

1382
01:03:49,679 --> 01:03:54,539
was uptake was taken into the plant

1383
01:03:52,050 --> 01:03:56,850
because there was not supplied but once

1384
01:03:54,539 --> 01:04:01,820
it was supplied the potassium levels

1385
01:03:56,849 --> 01:04:05,789
were quite high in the plant and we

1386
01:04:01,820 --> 01:04:11,840
referenced our survey values in the

1387
01:04:05,789 --> 01:04:13,920
paper as well and those were within the

1388
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:16,769
reference values that we had in our

1389
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:18,240
initial study but I would agree with you

1390
01:04:16,769 --> 01:04:21,690
that more work definitely needs to be

1391
01:04:18,239 --> 01:04:25,500
done in potassium as far as its role in

1392
01:04:21,690 --> 01:04:29,460
the developments and etc as you touched

1393
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:32,730
upon I am uncomfortable addressing that

1394
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:34,970
given you know we have not yet explored

1395
01:04:32,730 --> 01:04:38,460
the potassium rates and the lifecycle

1396
01:04:34,969 --> 01:04:40,379
but once we do that's definitely

1397
01:04:38,460 --> 01:04:43,530
something that I will be specifically

1398
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:46,890
looking for and comparing in our study

1399
01:04:43,530 --> 01:04:49,080
so that's extremely helpful I can't wait

1400
01:04:46,889 --> 01:04:50,670
to see that because what I so I'll get

1401
01:04:49,079 --> 01:04:52,529
from a grower I may like three tests for

1402
01:04:50,670 --> 01:04:54,389
example at the beginning of the grow

1403
01:04:52,530 --> 01:04:58,050
cycle and then wanted to end and what I

1404
01:04:54,389 --> 01:04:59,879
find is in terms of how far the

1405
01:04:58,050 --> 01:05:02,820
nutrients have dropped in the soil

1406
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:06,329
you know nitrogen and potassium are the

1407
01:05:02,820 --> 01:05:08,610
two that see that typically appear to

1408
01:05:06,329 --> 01:05:10,559
drop the most and as you mentioned they

1409
01:05:08,610 --> 01:05:12,240
are very mobile they could be being

1410
01:05:10,559 --> 01:05:13,829
leached out of the soil from a flooding

1411
01:05:12,239 --> 01:05:16,559
event but a lot of the guys that we're

1412
01:05:13,829 --> 01:05:18,869
working with too are using blue mats

1413
01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:22,170
which are essentially an automated

1414
01:05:18,869 --> 01:05:24,539
watering system that only waters as that

1415
01:05:22,170 --> 01:05:27,210
soil dries out so it's it's controlled

1416
01:05:24,539 --> 01:05:30,440
through osmotic pressure by the soil

1417
01:05:27,210 --> 01:05:33,079
itself and so we tend to not have

1418
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:36,858
a lot of leeching going on through that

1419
01:05:33,079 --> 01:05:38,839
bed so in theory if nothing's leeching

1420
01:05:36,858 --> 01:05:40,309
out the bottom of the bed then that that

1421
01:05:38,838 --> 01:05:42,108
potassium is being taken up into the

1422
01:05:40,309 --> 01:05:45,259
plant and as we see potassium levels

1423
01:05:42,108 --> 01:05:49,489
drop to let's say around five percent or

1424
01:05:45,260 --> 01:05:53,359
lower of the total cation exchange CC of

1425
01:05:49,489 --> 01:05:55,368
the death of total the total plant or

1426
01:05:53,358 --> 01:05:58,549
sorry total of what's available in the

1427
01:05:55,369 --> 01:06:00,858
soil I start to see smaller buds lower

1428
01:05:58,550 --> 01:06:02,329
yield that sort of thing so I'd love to

1429
01:06:00,858 --> 01:06:04,639
see research on that and see what really

1430
01:06:02,329 --> 01:06:07,849
is going on there in the leaf tissue

1431
01:06:04,639 --> 01:06:10,400
itself it's actually really interesting

1432
01:06:07,849 --> 01:06:12,170
I have to keep that in mind when looking

1433
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:13,880
at the study when we run the

1434
01:06:12,170 --> 01:06:15,650
micronutrients like I said we ran the

1435
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:18,349
micronutrients we have yet to run the

1436
01:06:15,650 --> 01:06:23,000
macro nutrients so I'd love to talk more

1437
01:06:18,349 --> 01:06:25,760
with you just off air about that that's

1438
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:28,699
actually very fascinating especially if

1439
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:33,230
they're using a blue mat system that

1440
01:06:28,699 --> 01:06:33,559
could potentially mean well we can talk

1441
01:06:33,230 --> 01:06:35,179
later

1442
01:06:33,559 --> 01:06:37,969
we can we can speculate about that later

1443
01:06:35,179 --> 01:06:40,068
I appreciate you hearing me out let's

1444
01:06:37,969 --> 01:06:42,199
move on to your micronutrient disorders

1445
01:06:40,068 --> 01:06:46,608
cuz you you had some interesting stuff

1446
01:06:42,199 --> 01:06:50,210
going on there too yeah so like I said

1447
01:06:46,608 --> 01:06:53,348
one of the nutrients that I'd like to

1448
01:06:50,210 --> 01:06:58,599
specifically highlight would be boron

1449
01:06:53,349 --> 01:07:00,890
and again that is involved in the

1450
01:06:58,599 --> 01:07:04,338
essentially cell wall development and

1451
01:07:00,889 --> 01:07:07,129
stabilization and so especially if you

1452
01:07:04,338 --> 01:07:09,828
experience a boron deficiency and then

1453
01:07:07,130 --> 01:07:12,039
you're close to your initiation of

1454
01:07:09,829 --> 01:07:15,170
reproduction and you don't remedy that

1455
01:07:12,039 --> 01:07:17,480
like I said one thing that we saw is we

1456
01:07:15,170 --> 01:07:19,940
have little to no flower bud formation

1457
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:22,400
due to the fact that meristematic region

1458
01:07:19,940 --> 01:07:25,010
was not able to properly develop and

1459
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:31,068
expand into the developing flower bud

1460
01:07:25,010 --> 01:07:32,930
and as far as I guess we can cut talk

1461
01:07:31,068 --> 01:07:35,239
about how copper was there specific one

1462
01:07:32,929 --> 01:07:37,009
that you want I do address no I think

1463
01:07:35,239 --> 01:07:39,739
what your your the overview your giving

1464
01:07:37,010 --> 01:07:40,790
is great I will just caution listeners

1465
01:07:39,739 --> 01:07:42,649
that when we're talking about these

1466
01:07:40,789 --> 01:07:44,000
micronutrients we're talking about very

1467
01:07:42,650 --> 01:07:46,760
very small amounts

1468
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:49,400
typically parts per million you don't

1469
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:51,830
need a lot of boron for a plant to be

1470
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:53,450
sufficient so you know don't go out

1471
01:07:51,829 --> 01:07:55,130
there and buy borax and apply a bunch to

1472
01:07:53,449 --> 01:07:56,809
your soil and think you're fixing a

1473
01:07:55,130 --> 01:07:58,760
deficiency because you'll probably kill

1474
01:07:56,809 --> 01:08:00,019
your plant I just want to highlight that

1475
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:01,780
for people when we talk about

1476
01:08:00,019 --> 01:08:04,159
micronutrients we're talking about

1477
01:08:01,780 --> 01:08:07,940
typically pretty small levels of

1478
01:08:04,159 --> 01:08:11,359
nutrient that's actually needed yeah

1479
01:08:07,940 --> 01:08:11,780
that's a fantastic point and to add to

1480
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:14,500
that

1481
01:08:11,780 --> 01:08:17,088
in this experiment we added a boron

1482
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:19,069
toxicity treatment so essentially what

1483
01:08:17,088 --> 01:08:21,350
we did is we took that modified

1484
01:08:19,069 --> 01:08:23,539
Eggland's solution we took the boron

1485
01:08:21,350 --> 01:08:27,259
levels and we increase them tenfold of

1486
01:08:23,539 --> 01:08:30,890
what the Hoagland solution requires and

1487
01:08:27,259 --> 01:08:33,170
we did that with manganese as well and

1488
01:08:30,890 --> 01:08:35,779
the reason we do that is because we

1489
01:08:33,170 --> 01:08:38,210
often see like you said it's very easy

1490
01:08:35,779 --> 01:08:41,150
to over apply a micronutrient so we also

1491
01:08:38,210 --> 01:08:44,029
wanted to try and capture some of those

1492
01:08:41,149 --> 01:08:46,879
toxicities and phonologies because not

1493
01:08:44,029 --> 01:08:48,740
every nutrient issue that you run into

1494
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:51,048
will be a deficiency sometimes you're

1495
01:08:48,739 --> 01:08:53,028
over applying something or something is

1496
01:08:51,048 --> 01:08:55,100
too available or the plant is taking up

1497
01:08:53,029 --> 01:08:57,049
too much of something or you know

1498
01:08:55,100 --> 01:08:59,120
another element may be in such high

1499
01:08:57,048 --> 01:09:04,159
quantities that it's causing another

1500
01:08:59,119 --> 01:09:05,809
element to the plant unavailable yeah

1501
01:09:04,159 --> 01:09:07,849
and it's what's interesting I'm looking

1502
01:09:05,810 --> 01:09:10,609
through these photos right now a boron

1503
01:09:07,850 --> 01:09:13,660
initial boron toxicity looks almost

1504
01:09:10,609 --> 01:09:17,810
exactly like your initial potassium

1505
01:09:13,659 --> 01:09:20,479
deficiency they're very close correct

1506
01:09:17,810 --> 01:09:22,580
and I think that's interesting for

1507
01:09:20,479 --> 01:09:24,169
people because I've seen people walk

1508
01:09:22,579 --> 01:09:25,818
into a grow room look at a plant and

1509
01:09:24,170 --> 01:09:27,770
immediately say oh that's nitrogen

1510
01:09:25,819 --> 01:09:32,390
though that's potassium oh whatever

1511
01:09:27,770 --> 01:09:34,310
and that always makes me nervous because

1512
01:09:32,390 --> 01:09:35,960
there are there's so many variables

1513
01:09:34,310 --> 01:09:38,630
associated with this I mean a lot of

1514
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:40,489
especially in soils a lot of your

1515
01:09:38,630 --> 01:09:42,259
nutrient deficiencies and excesses can

1516
01:09:40,489 --> 01:09:44,298
be related to hydrology or the way that

1517
01:09:42,259 --> 01:09:45,859
you're watering by just under water in

1518
01:09:44,298 --> 01:09:47,359
your plant you can cause a lot of

1519
01:09:45,859 --> 01:09:48,980
nutrient deficiencies because the

1520
01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:52,420
microbes aren't able to cycle nutrients

1521
01:09:48,979 --> 01:09:54,919
effectively due to a lack of water so or

1522
01:09:52,420 --> 01:09:56,480
due to lack of osmotic pressure move

1523
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:57,859
those nutrients throughout the plant so

1524
01:09:56,479 --> 01:10:00,769
I think that's really important

1525
01:09:57,859 --> 01:10:02,889
highlight I just want to point that out

1526
01:10:00,770 --> 01:10:05,929
while we're while we're on the topic

1527
01:10:02,889 --> 01:10:07,489
yeah I think that's a great point I find

1528
01:10:05,929 --> 01:10:10,760
one of the most helpful things you can

1529
01:10:07,488 --> 01:10:14,269
ask any grower of any crop is first and

1530
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:17,539
foremost for a crop history because most

1531
01:10:14,270 --> 01:10:19,550
of the times you're seeing something

1532
01:10:17,539 --> 01:10:22,000
that is an issue that was created

1533
01:10:19,550 --> 01:10:26,600
sometime in the past it is now

1534
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:29,300
manifesting and so that's a fantastic

1535
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:31,699
point and I'm glad to see that there's

1536
01:10:29,300 --> 01:10:33,770
other people out there who are you know

1537
01:10:31,698 --> 01:10:36,439
stopping and thinking and taking a more

1538
01:10:33,770 --> 01:10:39,830
holistic approach to you know diagnosing

1539
01:10:36,439 --> 01:10:41,988
issues yeah was there anything else you

1540
01:10:39,829 --> 01:10:44,210
want to touch on regarding the manganese

1541
01:10:41,988 --> 01:10:47,238
or boron toxicities that you saw or

1542
01:10:44,210 --> 01:10:50,800
either of those elements in general in

1543
01:10:47,238 --> 01:10:54,618
relation to plant growth or plant health

1544
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:56,869
yeah one thing I will say is when

1545
01:10:54,618 --> 01:10:59,299
looking at toxicities and you can see

1546
01:10:56,868 --> 01:11:01,819
this in the photos and I hope that this

1547
01:10:59,300 --> 01:11:05,449
photo also gets posted so the listeners

1548
01:11:01,819 --> 01:11:08,750
can reference it you will often see that

1549
01:11:05,448 --> 01:11:10,309
toxicity Centron ology regardless of

1550
01:11:08,750 --> 01:11:12,738
element follows a very specific

1551
01:11:10,310 --> 01:11:17,179
progression where you see that you know

1552
01:11:12,738 --> 01:11:19,789
marginal chlorosis so that yellowing of

1553
01:11:17,179 --> 01:11:22,460
the margin first and then it will

1554
01:11:19,789 --> 01:11:26,510
progress to the marginal necrosis which

1555
01:11:22,460 --> 01:11:29,239
is that burning or that the browning of

1556
01:11:26,510 --> 01:11:31,159
the leaf margin and you'll see that and

1557
01:11:29,238 --> 01:11:33,309
you can see that and you know the

1558
01:11:31,158 --> 01:11:36,379
comparison image that we have between

1559
01:11:33,310 --> 01:11:39,710
manganese toxicity and boron toxicity

1560
01:11:36,380 --> 01:11:42,250
you know that the marginal symptomology

1561
01:11:39,710 --> 01:11:44,929
is very pronounced in almost any

1562
01:11:42,250 --> 01:11:48,050
toxicity so just kind of as a side note

1563
01:11:44,929 --> 01:11:50,079
you know being careful and cautious when

1564
01:11:48,050 --> 01:11:52,539
you know dealing with the leaf margin

1565
01:11:50,079 --> 01:11:57,050
especially if it's going chlorotic or

1566
01:11:52,539 --> 01:11:59,149
necrotic yeah that's that's excellent

1567
01:11:57,050 --> 01:12:01,010
advice I that wasn't something I was

1568
01:11:59,149 --> 01:12:03,138
aware of or had really ever thought of

1569
01:12:01,010 --> 01:12:05,480
honestly when I think of toxicity so I'm

1570
01:12:03,139 --> 01:12:07,099
glad you pointed that out yeah did you

1571
01:12:05,479 --> 01:12:10,098
want to touch on did you want to move on

1572
01:12:07,099 --> 01:12:11,300
to your what looks like iron and zinc

1573
01:12:10,099 --> 01:12:16,489
were the next two

1574
01:12:11,300 --> 01:12:22,159
on in your paper yeah we can live on the

1575
01:12:16,488 --> 01:12:24,529
iron so again as I stated magnesium

1576
01:12:22,158 --> 01:12:27,018
toxicity our magnesium deficiency

1577
01:12:24,529 --> 01:12:29,059
manganese deficiency iron deficiency

1578
01:12:27,019 --> 01:12:32,119
they all kind of have this intervene all

1579
01:12:29,059 --> 01:12:36,409
chlorosis symptom symptoms that develop

1580
01:12:32,118 --> 01:12:38,779
on the foliage and so you know doing

1581
01:12:36,408 --> 01:12:41,569
work like this we're trying as best we

1582
01:12:38,779 --> 01:12:44,238
can to develop these criterias and

1583
01:12:41,569 --> 01:12:46,429
checklist suppose visually and with leaf

1584
01:12:44,238 --> 01:12:48,618
tissue to help people diagnose things

1585
01:12:46,429 --> 01:12:51,559
but a lot of times the symptom ologies

1586
01:12:48,618 --> 01:12:53,839
are very similar so being careful that

1587
01:12:51,559 --> 01:12:56,559
when you're looking at these that you're

1588
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:58,849
taking again a holistic approach and

1589
01:12:56,559 --> 01:13:02,260
trying to utilize the tools that are

1590
01:12:58,849 --> 01:13:06,889
available to you to help diagnose these

1591
01:13:02,260 --> 01:13:09,619
the iron deficiency again you'll get the

1592
01:13:06,889 --> 01:13:12,769
severe inner vein of chlorosis and those

1593
01:13:09,618 --> 01:13:14,719
more advanced symptoms and hopefully you

1594
01:13:12,769 --> 01:13:17,929
know we can identify and remedy iron

1595
01:13:14,719 --> 01:13:19,698
before it gets this level but letting

1596
01:13:17,929 --> 01:13:22,190
the plants go out this far that's one of

1597
01:13:19,698 --> 01:13:25,279
the reasons that we allowed you know the

1598
01:13:22,189 --> 01:13:26,748
plants to grow in these deficient

1599
01:13:25,279 --> 01:13:28,759
conditions for so long so that we'd have

1600
01:13:26,748 --> 01:13:38,809
that gradient the beginning I mean in

1601
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:41,329
advance entomology and as far as iron is

1602
01:13:38,809 --> 01:13:44,329
concerned it is another immobile element

1603
01:13:41,328 --> 01:13:46,788
so for this particular opponent if

1604
01:13:44,328 --> 01:13:49,219
you're seeing symptomology on the new

1605
01:13:46,788 --> 01:13:50,630
expanding leaves the growing portions

1606
01:13:49,219 --> 01:13:52,429
the plants that the portions of the

1607
01:13:50,630 --> 01:13:54,980
plant that are actively growing this is

1608
01:13:52,429 --> 01:13:57,618
where you're going to be seeing that you

1609
01:13:54,979 --> 01:14:00,259
know intervene or chlorosis and so

1610
01:13:57,618 --> 01:14:02,479
looking at where on the plant these

1611
01:14:00,260 --> 01:14:04,550
symptoms are occurring will help you

1612
01:14:02,479 --> 01:14:06,589
identify and you know kind of utilize

1613
01:14:04,550 --> 01:14:08,449
that as a checklist you know is this

1614
01:14:06,590 --> 01:14:11,659
iron or is this you know a mobile

1615
01:14:08,448 --> 01:14:13,748
element and there's some wonderful

1616
01:14:11,658 --> 01:14:18,319
charts online that you all can utilize

1617
01:14:13,748 --> 01:14:20,899
if you just look at nutrient mobility in

1618
01:14:18,319 --> 01:14:22,279
plants it will tell you which there's

1619
01:14:20,899 --> 01:14:24,859
some charts out there that have you know

1620
01:14:22,279 --> 01:14:26,389
categorize mobile elements versus in

1621
01:14:24,859 --> 01:14:31,819
mobile

1622
01:14:26,390 --> 01:14:34,789
and we'll help you identify more it's

1623
01:14:31,819 --> 01:14:39,769
it's a tool a diagnostic tool that you

1624
01:14:34,789 --> 01:14:43,010
can utilize to figure out which element

1625
01:14:39,770 --> 01:14:48,940
you may be experiencing which nutrient

1626
01:14:43,010 --> 01:14:50,480
may be limiting in your fertility regime

1627
01:14:48,939 --> 01:14:53,359
that's great

1628
01:14:50,479 --> 01:14:56,779
yeah I think you covered it anything you

1629
01:14:53,359 --> 01:14:58,279
want to touch on regarding zinc or icy

1630
01:14:56,779 --> 01:15:01,130
you mentioned even molybdenum I have

1631
01:14:58,279 --> 01:15:04,389
done zero work on the lib to them I

1632
01:15:01,130 --> 01:15:06,560
really don't know much about it overall

1633
01:15:04,390 --> 01:15:09,070
there's everything you want to share in

1634
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:16,910
particular relating to either of those

1635
01:15:09,069 --> 01:15:21,409
yeah we utilized molybdenum because it

1636
01:15:16,909 --> 01:15:23,930
is a plant essential micronutrients but

1637
01:15:21,409 --> 01:15:28,210
as far as plants that often display

1638
01:15:23,930 --> 01:15:31,760
symptom ology and molybdenum deficiency

1639
01:15:28,210 --> 01:15:34,810
it's kind of hit or miss most of the

1640
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:38,590
time I lived in um is more important for

1641
01:15:34,810 --> 01:15:44,650
nodule aiding plants so plants that will

1642
01:15:38,590 --> 01:15:47,739
form associations with bacteria to form

1643
01:15:44,649 --> 01:15:51,199
root nodules to fix atmospheric nitrogen

1644
01:15:47,739 --> 01:15:53,239
such as your lagoons but for example

1645
01:15:51,199 --> 01:15:55,789
poinsettias poinsettias will often

1646
01:15:53,239 --> 01:15:57,529
display a molybdenum deficiency so it

1647
01:15:55,789 --> 01:15:59,630
was kind of hit or miss we kind of threw

1648
01:15:57,529 --> 01:16:04,340
it in just for fun to kind of see what

1649
01:15:59,630 --> 01:16:08,150
would happen but like I said and you can

1650
01:16:04,340 --> 01:16:10,880
look at the the composite picture not

1651
01:16:08,149 --> 01:16:15,439
much symptom ology occurred and we did

1652
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:18,529
not have statistically significant

1653
01:16:15,439 --> 01:16:22,879
differences in dry weights even though

1654
01:16:18,529 --> 01:16:25,250
we did receive a statistically

1655
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:28,489
significant difference and leave tissue

1656
01:16:25,250 --> 01:16:30,409
concentration of molybdenum so basically

1657
01:16:28,489 --> 01:16:32,689
there was more molybdenum in the leaf

1658
01:16:30,409 --> 01:16:34,779
tissue in your treatment versus the

1659
01:16:32,689 --> 01:16:37,449
control however that didn't display

1660
01:16:34,779 --> 01:16:39,369
visually or in turn

1661
01:16:37,449 --> 01:16:42,670
of your overall biomass when you measure

1662
01:16:39,369 --> 01:16:44,859
the two plants it sounds like from what

1663
01:16:42,670 --> 01:16:47,680
I'm from what I'm getting one thing I

1664
01:16:44,859 --> 01:16:50,049
will say is because we use you know kelp

1665
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:51,430
things like kelp meal and rock dust I

1666
01:16:50,050 --> 01:16:52,930
have never really worried about

1667
01:16:51,430 --> 01:16:54,880
molybdenum I figure we're picking some

1668
01:16:52,930 --> 01:16:56,260
up through those because they contain

1669
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:58,119
some of those elements but I'll be

1670
01:16:56,260 --> 01:17:00,520
curious to see as you move through

1671
01:16:58,119 --> 01:17:02,590
flower looking at molybdenum if you

1672
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:05,170
start to see statistically significant

1673
01:17:02,590 --> 01:17:08,680
differences in overall yield or

1674
01:17:05,170 --> 01:17:09,760
cannabinoid content that that might be

1675
01:17:08,680 --> 01:17:11,170
interesting because I'd like to maybe

1676
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:14,020
start playing around with the addition

1677
01:17:11,170 --> 01:17:16,270
of molybdenum to see if it makes it has

1678
01:17:14,020 --> 01:17:22,210
real any real growth impact or plant

1679
01:17:16,270 --> 01:17:25,300
health impact yeah that's definitely

1680
01:17:22,210 --> 01:17:29,050
something that we'll be looking at with

1681
01:17:25,300 --> 01:17:31,210
regard to our statistical analysis on

1682
01:17:29,050 --> 01:17:33,310
the micronutrient study that we just

1683
01:17:31,210 --> 01:17:38,079
completed the rate over life cycle

1684
01:17:33,310 --> 01:17:40,150
experiment that all all of these

1685
01:17:38,079 --> 01:17:42,880
micronutrients it's going to be very

1686
01:17:40,149 --> 01:17:45,009
interesting to see what happens with the

1687
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:49,869
different rates over the life cycle of

1688
01:17:45,010 --> 01:17:52,449
the plant cool well I think you covered

1689
01:17:49,869 --> 01:17:55,149
all my questions I know there's some of

1690
01:17:52,449 --> 01:17:56,739
the discussion explains some of your

1691
01:17:55,149 --> 01:17:58,179
findings which really fits with I think

1692
01:17:56,739 --> 01:18:00,670
we already covered most of that just in

1693
01:17:58,180 --> 01:18:01,840
our discussion of the elements but was

1694
01:18:00,670 --> 01:18:05,440
there anything else you wanted to add

1695
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:10,590
regarding this research before we sign

1696
01:18:05,439 --> 01:18:13,179
off yeah just again to reiterate that

1697
01:18:10,590 --> 01:18:15,100
one of the most valuable things you can

1698
01:18:13,180 --> 01:18:17,170
do whenever you're looking at a problem

1699
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:19,750
is utilizing the tools that you have

1700
01:18:17,170 --> 01:18:21,250
available to you you know looking at

1701
01:18:19,750 --> 01:18:24,279
what you did in the past to try and

1702
01:18:21,250 --> 01:18:26,949
figure out you know is for example you

1703
01:18:24,279 --> 01:18:29,979
used water am i providing enough water

1704
01:18:26,949 --> 01:18:33,939
and is that causing a nutrient issue de

1705
01:18:29,979 --> 01:18:37,149
facto or you know did I apply something

1706
01:18:33,939 --> 01:18:39,279
that may now be in interacting and a

1707
01:18:37,149 --> 01:18:42,759
negative effect in the soil profile and

1708
01:18:39,279 --> 01:18:46,929
causing another element to be plant

1709
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:49,270
unavailable and again this this work

1710
01:18:46,930 --> 01:18:51,019
where we're still in a process we're

1711
01:18:49,270 --> 01:18:53,979
learning we're producing science it's

1712
01:18:51,019 --> 01:18:56,479
additive process so this is you know

1713
01:18:53,979 --> 01:19:00,229
visual symptom ology is correlated to

1714
01:18:56,479 --> 01:19:03,229
leaf tissue and you know these these

1715
01:19:00,229 --> 01:19:04,819
pictures are very helpful and useful but

1716
01:19:03,229 --> 01:19:07,939
again some of the symptomatology is

1717
01:19:04,819 --> 01:19:09,669
similar so looking at you know the

1718
01:19:07,939 --> 01:19:11,659
progression of the symptom ology

1719
01:19:09,668 --> 01:19:14,328
comparing that to the pictures and then

1720
01:19:11,658 --> 01:19:16,969
also looking at where on the plant those

1721
01:19:14,328 --> 01:19:20,628
symptoms are occurring will be extremely

1722
01:19:16,969 --> 01:19:22,609
useful oh I look forward to seeing

1723
01:19:20,628 --> 01:19:25,219
further research out of your University

1724
01:19:22,609 --> 01:19:27,349
and and you personally and I'm really

1725
01:19:25,219 --> 01:19:28,489
grateful for your time today and I look

1726
01:19:27,349 --> 01:19:30,588
forward to staying in touch and

1727
01:19:28,488 --> 01:19:32,028
hopefully we'll get to have you or

1728
01:19:30,588 --> 01:19:33,948
someone when your colleagues back on

1729
01:19:32,029 --> 01:19:36,819
soon to talk about some of the latest

1730
01:19:33,948 --> 01:19:39,048
research and use some of your findings

1731
01:19:36,819 --> 01:19:40,729
absolutely yeah we're definitely very

1732
01:19:39,048 --> 01:19:43,278
excited for a lot of the research we're

1733
01:19:40,729 --> 01:19:45,499
doing and definitely even more excited

1734
01:19:43,279 --> 01:19:49,819
to continue talking with growers and

1735
01:19:45,498 --> 01:19:51,048
producers to you know understand the

1736
01:19:49,819 --> 01:19:53,689
needs that they have

1737
01:19:51,048 --> 01:19:55,998
as far as research is concerned it's

1738
01:19:53,689 --> 01:19:58,699
very much a two-way street

1739
01:19:55,998 --> 01:20:01,278
what the industry needs and does and the

1740
01:19:58,698 --> 01:20:03,348
issues that they're experiencing helped

1741
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:05,629
us do better research that's more

1742
01:20:03,349 --> 01:20:05,929
applicable and helps the industry as a

1743
01:20:05,628 --> 01:20:10,010
whole

1744
01:20:05,929 --> 01:20:11,658
so this bilateral exchange is extremely

1745
01:20:10,010 --> 01:20:14,719
important and definitely is something

1746
01:20:11,658 --> 01:20:17,748
that needs to continue in greater

1747
01:20:14,719 --> 01:20:19,099
quantity for all researchers that are

1748
01:20:17,748 --> 01:20:20,909
going to be doing work in hemp or

1749
01:20:19,099 --> 01:20:28,628
cannabis
