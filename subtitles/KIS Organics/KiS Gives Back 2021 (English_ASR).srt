00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,759

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,519
offering smaller amounts of amendments

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,519
and soils online

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,839
and i didn't know if you're gonna make

8
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:19,278
it and we've had a lot of ups and downs

9
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:22,240

15
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,399
