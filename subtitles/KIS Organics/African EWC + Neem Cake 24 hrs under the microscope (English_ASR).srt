1
00:00:00,589 --> 00:00:07,679
well what do you know I didn't expect to

2
00:00:03,388 --> 00:00:14,758
find this but some pretty good fungal

3
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:18,600
growth going on here now this this

4
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:20,730
compost as control really didn't produce

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,519
that well when we added the molasses as

6
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:26,670
a food source we saw quite a bit of

7
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:31,948
activity but I really didn't expect to

8
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:36,260
find this much activity just from the

9
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:39,539
addition of neem again this is neem cake

10
00:00:36,259 --> 00:00:50,839
not neem oil and it's a high quality

11
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:56,628
brand this appears to be that High Line

12
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:56,629
fungi got that reddish tinge to it

13
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:07,629
again 24 hours now we're 400 times

14
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:07,629
magnification

15
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:28,219
some time I've had Pierce seem to like

16
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,220
the name cake
