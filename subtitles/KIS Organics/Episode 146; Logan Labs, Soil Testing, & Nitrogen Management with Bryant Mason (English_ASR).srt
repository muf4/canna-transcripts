Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and

3
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,400
Science podcast. I'm your host, Tad

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Hussy of Kiss Organics. This is the

5
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:27,598
podcast where we discuss the cutting

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,759
edge of growing from a science-based

7
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,199
perspective and drawn top experts from

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,120
around the industry to share their

9
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,520
wisdom and knowledge. My guest this week

10
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:37,439
is Bryant Mason. I've had Bryant on the

11
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,079
podcast a few times in the past and he's

12
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:42,079
one of my favorite guests. Bryant is a

13
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,558
certified crop adviser who specializes

14
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,320
in organic cannabis nutrition. He has

15
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:48,479
spent the last eight years working to

16
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,238
combine precision laboratory techniques

17
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:52,238
with data science in an effort to

18
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:54,718
unravel the complexities of cannabis

19
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:56,878
soil and crop nutrition. Along with his

20
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,719
work on soilless media, he also helps

21
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:00,320
outdoor cultivators around the United

22
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,719
States with nutrient management and

23
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,959
cover cropping. If you would like to do

24
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,200
soil testing, help interpreting a soil

25
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:09,359
test, or interested in an online course

26
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,359
on these subjects, his website is

27
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:12,359
www.soildconulting.com.

28
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:17,519
And if you want to save $100 on his

29
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:20,879
course, you can use the discount code

30
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:22,640
KIS Organics, all one word. I've taken

31
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:24,239
his course and was recently going back

32
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,000
to review some of the content. It's

33
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:27,759
excellent and I highly recommend it for

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,719
anyone wanting to do a deep dive on

35
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:32,159
cannabis fertility and reusing your

36
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:33,920
soil. Now, after recording the podcast

37
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,759
with Bryant, he had a couple of points

38
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,840
he wanted to clarify. So, there is a

39
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,239
short addendum that I added in at the

40
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,799
very beginning of the podcast. Now on to

41
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:44,560
the show on and talk a little bit more

42
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,960
about some of these topics that we

43
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,040
covered in the podcast. Uh let's just

44
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:52,399
dive right into the first part which was

45
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,799
where we discussed uh Logan Labs. And

46
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:57,519
one of the questions I'm seeing from my

47
00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:00,640
most recent post on social media is do

48
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:04,078
we need to retest? Uh are these tests

49
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,519
that we got during this period um which

50
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:07,359
we'll get into a little more detail with

51
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:10,399
here as you listen to the podcast. Are

52
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:13,759
these um are these tests erroneous or

53
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,759
can we still utilize that

54
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:21,359
data? It's a great question. The

55
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:22,878
majority of the data on those tests is

56
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,640
totally accurate. For one thing, the

57
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:27,359
soil report, the what I call the

58
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:30,878
standard test is is accurate and most of

59
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,400
the paste information is is accurate or

60
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:33,919
fairly accurate. What I've been telling

61
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,039
growers at least in the period of time

62
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:40,039
where um sulfur chloride and a few of

63
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:43,598
the cations ions were elevated

64
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:46,159
is really if your plants look good and

65
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:49,280
you're not seeing any problems related

66
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:51,598
to salt stress then there really isn't

67
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,800
any need to retest. You can just retest

68
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:58,719
at your normal interval and uh you'll

69
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,480
see the updated more accurate data. So,

70
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:02,199
uh, just take those numbers with a grain

71
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:04,079
of salt. And in terms of the

72
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:06,079
interpretation, if you're seeing really,

73
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,000
really high numbers, I would suggest not

74
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,000
leeching and just sort of ignoring them.

75
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,479
This is something we talk about off air,

76
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,840
but essentially this is a good rule of

77
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:19,598
thumb. Anyway, so typically if we see

78
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,360
high EC, high soluble salts from I know

79
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:24,479
you listed sulfur. I'm thinking more of

80
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:27,200
like chloride, sodium, um, nitrates,

81
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:29,280
then you'll typically recommend leeching

82
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:32,479
the beds to reduce those numbers down to

83
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,239
a better level to reduce osmotic

84
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:35,518
pressure on the root system. It's just

85
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,319
easier for the plants to take up

86
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:41,280
nutrients.

87
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:43,759
However, if your plants look great and

88
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,479
you're not seeing that reflected what's

89
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:48,719
showing on the test reflected on in your

90
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:51,719
plants, um what's your recommendation

91
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:51,719
then?

92
00:03:54,239 --> 00:04:00,878
Yeah, this is a good nuance to cover uh

93
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:03,598
because I have thresholds at which I

94
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:05,919
recommend leeching. And the idea is

95
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:07,598
we're trying to optimize

96
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:10,479
uh even if the plants are relatively

97
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:13,759
healthy, if we can reduce the osmotic

98
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:15,438
stress to the roots, you can have better

99
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:17,279
healthier plants that are higher

100
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:20,079
yielding. But there's a there's a line

101
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:23,758
between what's operationally feasible

102
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:26,639
and the marginal improvement in in plant

103
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:29,120
health that really has to be an on-site

104
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,720
decision. So if your plants look healthy

105
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,240
and you're very satisfied with the

106
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,919
production, then then you may not need

107
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,360
to leech even when there's a leeching

108
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:40,240
recommendation. And that's just really

109
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:43,680
sort of a of a a grower decision. Now, I

110
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:46,079
I'd say that if you if you see any poor

111
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,759
plant health or negative symptoms, then

112
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:49,519
I would absolutely recommend leeching

113
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,360
when levels are high. So, there isn't a

114
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:53,758
magic number. I mean, we have thresholds

115
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,160
where, you know, if you were 300

116
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:59,280
chlorides, we would recommend uh

117
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,520
leeching 300 ppm. However, if your

118
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:05,198
plants look great and you're not seeing

119
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:06,959
any visual symptoms and leeching is is,

120
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,960
you know, obviously a lot of work, it's

121
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:11,758
a lot of water. It's labor intensive.

122
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:13,359
It's uh material intensive in terms of

123
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,038
the amount of water you have to use. Uh

124
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,879
you don't necessarily have to do that.

125
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:18,560
There is no magic number that above that

126
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:21,038
number your plants are going to look

127
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,240
like crap and suffer or below that

128
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:24,519
number your plants are going to be

129
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,680
amazing. Um, it's really

130
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:29,439
just what we've seen based on looking

131
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,519
at, you know, hundreds if not thousands

132
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:33,519
of these soil tests and sort of where we

133
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:37,439
think that this this level sort of

134
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:37,439
exists. But it is a very arbitrary

135
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,439
number. Well, yeah. And the and the

136
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,919
reason that there's not a a hard and

137
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:48,918
fast number is because the

138
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:52,639
um the

139
00:05:48,918 --> 00:05:54,879
osmotic problem gets worse when

140
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,759
evaporation rates are higher. So high

141
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:59,759
temperature, high air flow, high

142
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:02,560
radiation is when the plant needs to be

143
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:05,680
uptaking more water. And so oftent times

144
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,120
that higher EC is preventing it from

145
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,199
doing so. And that's when you start to

146
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,240
see issues. So the the environmental

147
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:14,160
conditions are are going

148
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,759
to in many ways determine when the

149
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,439
plants are actually suffering from

150
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,199
osmotic stress. And so that's a number

151
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:20,719
another reason these numbers are a

152
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,400
little loose. Now if you're in the

153
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,919
winter and it's temperatures are

154
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:27,359
depressed or the radiation, you know,

155
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:29,198
your um PPFD is a little lower, your

156
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,800
evaporation, your total evaporation is

157
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,439
just on the lower side, then you might

158
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,720
be able to get away with quite a bit

159
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:38,478
higher levels of salts. So again, it's

160
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:40,160
it's have to And I want to also add that

161
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:43,599
there is the possibility of sampling

162
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:47,039
error here where if a small amount of

163
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:49,199
fish bone meal or alphalfpha meal or

164
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:52,079
whatever organic amendment gypsum ends

165
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:54,240
up in your tiny sample that could

166
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:56,800
dramatically skew your results and and

167
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,800
show numbers that might be higher than

168
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,160
what's actually in your soil or

169
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,598
reflected in your soil because one of

170
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,479
the things that you mentioned in this

171
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:06,639
podcast is later on is that soil is not

172
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:09,199
homogeneous. we we think of it as

173
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:11,360
homogeneous but really it's it's not

174
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:14,240
homogeneous at all even with these

175
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,800
potting soils. So um through no fault of

176
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:20,240
the lab uh potentially the results could

177
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,240
be skewed just from from

178
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:27,598
sampling. Yes, that that so I I I

179
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,439
sometimes have that concern with

180
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:30,959
nitrogen because it's on the the soil

181
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:32,959
report and the scoop size is quite

182
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:34,399
small. But when it comes to most the

183
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:36,719
soluble salts, I'm looking at them on

184
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:40,079
the paste report and the sample size is

185
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,919
a cup. So it that does help eliminate,

186
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:43,519
you know, a small chunk of one thing or

187
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:44,799
the other because the sample is quite

188
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:46,519
large when we're looking at the paste

189
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,360
test.

190
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:51,439
Um, but it's a it's a it's a valid point

191
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,598
to consider. And yeah, I mean, when we

192
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:56,160
were talking about pH reactions, that's

193
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:58,878
really where there's these very small

194
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:01,759
there's there's a nonhomogeneous soil.

195
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:04,160
So there's small pockets of low pH, high

196
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,479
pH. The ryosphere is different. There's

197
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,800
not the bulk soil pH is is a bit of a

198
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:11,918
misnomer in the sense that there's just

199
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:15,120
many different pockets of I think that's

200
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:17,038
a good transition into the conversation

201
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,879
that we had on the podcast about

202
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:21,199
nitrogen and there was a couple things

203
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:23,840
that you wanted to go back and clarify

204
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:27,080
around that that topic. Do you want to

205
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:27,079
share that?

206
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:34,399
Yeah, thanks. I I we hung up after the

207
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:37,918
initial podcast and I thought, you know,

208
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:40,958
my my answer to your question on how

209
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:42,958
nitrogen amendments affects pH wasn't

210
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:45,679
totally precise when I thought about it

211
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:47,039
more. So, I just want to clarify. So, we

212
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:50,799
talked about the nitrogen conversion

213
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:54,240
process. When nitrogen mineralizes from

214
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:56,559
organic nitrogen to ammonium, um there's

215
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,039
a slight increase in pH because the

216
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:02,159
ammonia combines with a hydrogen ion to

217
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:04,799
create ammonium. Uh so that consumes a

218
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:08,958
hydrogen ion and that will therefore

219
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:10,719
increase the pH. Then in that second

220
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:14,159
part of the nitrogen conversion process

221
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:17,040
when ammonium goes to nitrate um there's

222
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:18,799
actually a decrease in pH and that's

223
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:21,439
because it goes to nitrite and then to

224
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:23,359
nitrate and in both of those steps uh

225
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:28,040
hydrogen ions are released. So that's

226
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:29,560
going to acidify the soil. Um, and so

227
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:33,360
the

228
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:37,159
the there is a a slightly acidifying

229
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:39,919
effect when organic nitrogen converts to

230
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:42,879
nitrate. Um, I said that there's a

231
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:46,079
there's a a net zero effect in the pH

232
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:49,519
change. And so technically the nitrogen

233
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:52,080
conversion process acidifying but um the

234
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:55,919
reason that I generally don't see a pH

235
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:59,360
change in living soils is uh because

236
00:09:55,919 --> 00:10:01,039
there's also the influence of of the the

237
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,959
characteristics of the amendment that

238
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:04,958
you're using. So for example when

239
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:06,399
alphalfpha meal mineralizes there's a

240
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:09,199
number of base cations ions that are

241
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,799
contributing um that are contributed to

242
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,000
the soil that more than offset the

243
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:15,439
acidity contri contributed by the

244
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,240
nitrification. Now other amendments and

245
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,160
I use this example to you is cotton seed

246
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,320
meal. Not that many people use

247
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:24,799
cottonseed meal. It contributes a lot of

248
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,120
sulfur and not many base cations ions.

249
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:29,439
So it can have a strong acid acidifying

250
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,679
effect. Um, but both of these are sort

251
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,839
of independent then from the nitrogen

252
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:36,000
conversion process. So there's the the

253
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,680
pH effect from nitrogen conversion and

254
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,440
then there's the pH effect from the

255
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:41,679
actual characteristics and the chemistry

256
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,519
of the amendment. And both of those are

257
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:45,838
different and that's ultimately what's

258
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:48,159
going to determine the net pH change

259
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:50,560
when you apply a nitrogen amendment. And

260
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:52,078
what I see generally is is not much

261
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:53,359
change in a living soil. The other

262
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:55,439
reason is living soils have more

263
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,759
buffering capacity. So if there is

264
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,760
slight downward pressure or upward

265
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:03,679
pressure uh from the amendment being

266
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:07,439
applied, the soil is often buffering

267
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:08,958
that and there's not a huge change. Uh

268
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,760
but you know there's always exceptions

269
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:14,479
and it I think a lot of it depends on

270
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:16,319
the rate of mineralization and the

271
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,959
quantity of amendment being used and

272
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,360
then like I said the which amendment. So

273
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:23,759
you're saying essentially something like

274
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,720
fishbone meal is giving you more than

275
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:29,278
just nitrogen conversion. It's also

276
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,720
giving you calcium or magnesium or or

277
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:33,600
these other cations ions that are going

278
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:36,720
to put upward pressure on pH. Therefore

279
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:39,360
sort of neutralizing the effects of this

280
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:42,680
nitrogen cycling that's occurring from a

281
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:45,919
pH perspective.

282
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:47,519
So I guess my the reason I asked this

283
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:49,838
question what was I was thinking in my

284
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:53,519
head and I didn't fully explain this was

285
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:56,200
if I already have a a freshly mixed soil

286
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:58,399
where that nitrogen is in the form of

287
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,680
ammonium and in my head I'm thinking

288
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,320
okay that's going to be if anything

289
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:07,759
raising pH slightly um because it's

290
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:10,079
showing as ammonium and my pH is 62 61

291
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:11,919
when that ammonium converts my pH is

292
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:14,958
certainly not going up. If anything, it

293
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:17,919
may drop a point or slightly um

294
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:19,759
depending on how these other factors

295
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:21,278
come into play and like you mentioned

296
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:24,639
the buffering capacity, but my

297
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:27,919
expectation is that pH is is is going to

298
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:31,278
maintain or drop and it's already low.

299
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:33,039
Um, so I like to wait to take the soil

300
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:35,519
test after, you know, wait for that

301
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:37,919
nitrogen to cycle. And I do sometimes

302
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,440
see the pH drop a little bit because on

303
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:41,439
the flip side, when I have a very high

304
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,600
pH, you know, uh, if I were to test the

305
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,639
soil right away and I'm 73, I might see

306
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:49,959
it drop down just slightly. Does that

307
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,959
make any sense?

308
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,759
Yeah, it does. And we have to keep in

309
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:57,919
mind that uh these con this conversion

310
00:12:55,759 --> 00:13:00,000
process is actually happening

311
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:03,120
simultaneously and there's you're at

312
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,480
different steps in the process you know

313
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,120
depending on the different particles of

314
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,959
nitrogen. So um when ammonium is is

315
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,320
elevating yeah you're seeing the pH go

316
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:12,159
up but at the same time there's also

317
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,680
ammonium going to nitrate that's putting

318
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:15,838
pressure down. So you can never really

319
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:17,439
pinpoint what's going to happen next.

320
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:20,240
And I think what you're saying is

321
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,160
accurate is just wait just wait till it

322
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,799
cooks or mineralizes whatever you want

323
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:26,399
to say and and uh sort of levels out

324
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:27,919
wherever it's going to end up and that's

325
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,600
when you want testing. And one other

326
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:31,360
thing you mentioned later in the podcast

327
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,680
just for folks that you didn't mention

328
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,600
just now is that there is this organic

329
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:37,759
pool of nitrogen and you'll explain more

330
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,200
about that later in the podcast but I

331
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:41,200
for people who are just listening I

332
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:43,680
don't want you to think we're ignoring a

333
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:45,519
major source of nitrogen here in this

334
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:47,439
conversation. We're just hyperfocused on

335
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:50,159
this one aspect of something we didn't

336
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,240
quite elaborate on.

337
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:54,240
Cool. Uh, and then there was one other

338
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,839
topic that you wanted to just offer some

339
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:59,039
clarification around. I'll I'll be

340
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,560
honest, it's not uh I'm not as informed

341
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:02,078
around environmental controls and some

342
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:06,679
of that. So, I'm going to let you just

343
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:06,679
kind of explain explain that.

344
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:11,360
Yeah, I was I was just sort of

345
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:13,679
explaining a scenario in which it's

346
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,560
possible to cool your greenhouse by

347
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:18,399
venting even if the outside air is

348
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:20,078
warmer than the inside of your

349
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,679
greenhouse, which sounds it's completely

350
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:24,078
counterintuitive. It sounds impossible,

351
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:25,759
but you can bring in warmer air and it

352
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:29,078
can actually cool your greenhouse. And

353
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:31,439
the reason that's possible is

354
00:14:29,078 --> 00:14:34,078
because temperature changes when there's

355
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,320
a a change in total energy. So, in other

356
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:37,679
words, um the temperature of your

357
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,600
greenhouse will only change if the

358
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:41,519
enalpy increases or decreases. And

359
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,000
enthalpy is a is a combination of

360
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,360
temperature and relative humidity. So,

361
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,639
let's say it's super hot outside. It's

362
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:51,199
like 97 degrees Fahrenheit and very dry,

363
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:53,039
20% relative humidity, and you're in and

364
00:14:51,198 --> 00:14:55,919
your greenhouse is slightly cooler,

365
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:58,559
maybe 95 degrees Fahrenheit and 40%

366
00:14:55,919 --> 00:15:00,078
relative humidity. If you vent, the

367
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:01,599
temperature in your greenhouse will

368
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:03,519
actually drop because there's a

369
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,560
reduction in enthalpy. So, this is just

370
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:10,000
one very niche example of what I was

371
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:12,239
explaining has been um kind of blowing

372
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,078
my mind as I as I go deeper into the the

373
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,680
science of energy balance and and

374
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:18,159
ventilation. Well, thanks for clarifying

375
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:20,638
those uh points and coming back on and I

376
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:24,759
hope folks continue to listen as we

377
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,759
start the rest of the podcast here.

378
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,440
Hey Bryant, you're you're a popular

379
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,600
guest. Thanks for coming back on the

380
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:39,519
show today. Thanks for having me again.

381
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:41,920
I'm excited to be here. Yeah. Well, um,

382
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,759
for people who are unfamiliar, please do

383
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:45,519
go back and check out the previous

384
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,879
podcasts that I've done with Bryant if

385
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,198
you want to get an idea of some of the

386
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:52,399
things we've already talked about. But

387
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:55,359
we have some new topics for today. And

388
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:57,519
let's just start off talking about uh

389
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,959
Logan Labs a little bit and lab testing

390
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:02,399
in general because

391
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:04,638
um just to throw it out there, I know

392
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:07,360
you found some inconsistencies

393
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:09,759
uh in the test results starting around

394
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:13,440
in August and I had seen some things too

395
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:14,879
on my end that uh were were often we had

396
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,040
both reached out to Logan. We reached

397
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:18,720
out we talked to each other about this

398
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:20,958
and some other people had reached out to

399
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,920
us. Can you just give us a little more

400
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:27,518
context of what was going on and where

401
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:30,319
to go from here? Yeah, sure. Like you

402
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:33,519
said, in August of 2024,

403
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:35,440
um I saw a a number of tests that were

404
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:38,959
all very elevated in sulfur on the

405
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:41,759
saturated paste test, so soluble sulfur

406
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:44,719
and abnormally high levels. And I pretty

407
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:48,600
much within a day or two uh I told the

408
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:50,920
lab and this type of thing happens

409
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:54,959
occasionally and

410
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:56,879
uh the lab is very responsive to this

411
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:58,399
type of feedback because I'm looking at

412
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:00,720
so many tests and I'm one of their

413
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,399
partner aronomists and so they jumped on

414
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:06,240
it and they brought in what's called an

415
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:08,078
ICP technician. And ICP is the uh

416
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,838
advanced piece of equipment that

417
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:12,720
actually looks and determines nutrient

418
00:17:10,838 --> 00:17:15,359
concentrations. And the technicians

419
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,759
serviced the instrument, calibrated it.

420
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:21,678
Uh they went through multiple sort of

421
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:25,119
steps in QC, but unfortunately the issue

422
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:26,880
seemed to persist uh for for a while.

423
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:29,199
And I've just been thinking about it and

424
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,280
working with them slowly throughout the

425
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,080
months. Um, and it took a while to

426
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:36,399
figure it out, but ultimately, uh, I can

427
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:38,720
just tell you, we can jump into what was

428
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,320
going on. Before you do, can you just

429
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,720
talk about what the issue was that we

430
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:47,279
were that we were all seeing on our test

431
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:50,240
results? Mo mostly elevated levels of

432
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:53,519
sulfur but also slightly elevated levels

433
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:55,839
of chloride and a few of the cations

434
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:59,599
ions calcium, magnesium, potassium,

435
00:17:55,839 --> 00:18:02,480
although those were uh less so than than

436
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:05,119
sulfur. Now with that higher sulfur and

437
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,640
chloride number, the soluble salts

438
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:08,479
number was therefore a little bit higher

439
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,600
because that's one of the components of

440
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:14,880
soluble salts.

441
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:18,798
So what that led to was not necessarily

442
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:22,520
an overlication of anything but rather

443
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:25,200
an underlication in certain instances

444
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:27,200
because as as someone writing

445
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:31,200
recommendations I would see high levels

446
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:33,679
of sulfur and so I started for example

447
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:36,880
suggesting potassium silicate instead of

448
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:39,519
potassium sulfate in some instances. Um,

449
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:41,440
I also use what I call a governor in the

450
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:43,200
soil doctor tool algorithm. Like a car

451
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,720
has a governor that prevents you from

452
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:48,919
going too fast. Um, I essentially stop

453
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:51,440
the use of gypsum and potassium sulfate

454
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:55,280
above very very elevated levels of

455
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:56,798
sulfur. So in really high EC situations,

456
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:59,200
some of the recommendations didn't

457
00:18:56,798 --> 00:19:00,400
include gypsum or potassium sulfate. And

458
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:04,160
then the final thing which we've

459
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:06,320
discussed is uh in some instances I was

460
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,000
telling growers to leech their soil. So

461
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:11,519
essentially to flush the excess levels

462
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:14,000
of chloride um sulfur and I guess sodium

463
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:16,558
as a as a fourth cation I didn't mention

464
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,720
out of their soil to reduce the EC to to

465
00:19:16,558 --> 00:19:20,960
reduce those levels. So those are the

466
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,519
the substantial things that were

467
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:26,400
happening in the recommendations due to

468
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:29,038
these elevated levels. Now, uh to be

469
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:31,600
clear, that wasn't happening in all or

470
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:33,679
even most of the recommendations, but

471
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:35,519
definitely in some instances that was

472
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,038
happening.

473
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:39,359
That that's great. And I also want to

474
00:19:37,038 --> 00:19:41,839
add a couple just a little thing more

475
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:44,558
context here. So, and you already know

476
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:48,759
this, but for folks who are unfamiliar,

477
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:51,599
um sulfur in general is a pretty safe

478
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:53,839
uh mineral in the sense that high levels

479
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:55,279
of sulfur are not really uh having

480
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:57,439
negative impacts on your plants. You're

481
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:59,119
not going to see a sulfur toxicity, per

482
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,200
se. The issue there is it's going to

483
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:03,519
raise the EC or the soluble salt level

484
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,279
of your soil and potentially lead to a

485
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:07,440
little bit more osmotic pressure on the

486
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:09,038
roots, making it harder for your your

487
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:12,400
roots have to work harder to pull

488
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:14,160
nutrients up um versus uh a slightly

489
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,240
lower EC. So that's the issue with

490
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:19,600
sulfur. Now, with the chlorides, I just

491
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:21,279
want to emphasize that um for folks that

492
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:24,000
may have had to may have been given a

493
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:25,599
flushing recommendation that that

494
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,679
doesn't mean they were, you know, you

495
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:29,839
were at zero chlorides or 100 chlorides

496
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,440
and all of a sudden it's reporting 400

497
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:33,038
plus chlorides and you're you're having

498
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,200
to flush. These are probably test

499
00:20:33,038 --> 00:20:38,240
results where you were borderline or on

500
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:41,360
your way to needing to flush anyway. So,

501
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:43,120
it's not the worst thing. Um but

502
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:45,599
obviously not ideal either. We want to

503
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:47,839
be as targeted and accurate with these

504
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:49,759
tests as possible. I think that's really

505
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:51,959
well said, especially on the sulfur

506
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:55,279
front. I'll also add that

507
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:58,558
um for years I've been trying to figure

508
00:20:55,279 --> 00:21:00,119
out how to organically push calcium and

509
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:03,119
potassium levels

510
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:05,759
high without spiking the EC in the

511
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:07,359
soluble salts which is a very difficult

512
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:09,679
challenge because we're using large

513
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:11,918
quantities of just gypsum and potassium

514
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:14,840
sulfate in some instances langite a lot

515
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:17,919
of sulfur containing amendments.

516
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:19,119
So to your point, sometimes leeching is

517
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,840
a really great thing because you're just

518
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:23,359
sort of pushing levels down. And also

519
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:25,599
when I saw this, I changed my

520
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:28,359
recommendations a bit, my thresholds,

521
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:32,158
adjusting certain leeching thresholds.

522
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:33,918
Um, and so there was, you know, some

523
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,679
self-correction along the way because

524
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:38,720
this has been going on for several

525
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:40,880
months. Um, but anyway, that's that's a

526
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,200
little background. So let's let's talk

527
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,200
about what the actual issue was and how

528
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,679
that relates to Logan and if it's even

529
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:51,600
specific to Logan. Yeah. So and this is

530
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:53,038
where I've spent a lot of time is is not

531
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:54,798
only figuring out the solution but just

532
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:56,879
sort of putting the solution in a in a

533
00:21:54,798 --> 00:21:59,759
larger framework of is this Logan

534
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:02,720
specific, is it lab specific, etc. So

535
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:05,200
what happened is Logan actually has

536
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:08,000
really vigorous quality control. they

537
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:10,319
they re-calibrate their ICP every 20

538
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,440
samples, which is far more than most

539
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:15,200
labs. Some labs do it twice a day. Some

540
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,600
labs do it every hundred samples, but

541
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:20,400
every 20 samples is very rigorous. And

542
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:22,079
when they do that, they use uh what's

543
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,559
called a standard, which is a

544
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:27,960
calibration solution that's provided by

545
00:22:24,558 --> 00:22:31,200
the ICP company or technician.

546
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:33,679
And unfortunately, they were sold a

547
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,279
standard solution. The high-end, they

548
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:37,200
have a low-end standard solution and a

549
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:39,558
high-end solution to tell the machine

550
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:42,640
what's low, what's high. And those are

551
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:44,480
are known values. And the high-end

552
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,320
solution, they were sold a bad solution

553
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,839
that was overly concentrated. So, they

554
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:52,079
were calibrating that ICP machine to the

555
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:55,119
wrong standard because they were sold

556
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:56,480
the wrong liquid solution. And that's a

557
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:58,239
really tough thing to figure out because

558
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,360
they're continually recalibrating.

559
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,720
They're cleaning everything. They're

560
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:03,199
they're troubleshooting everything, but

561
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,839
the but the the known standard that's

562
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:09,519
supposed to be, you know, ground truth

563
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:10,959
is was off. Um, and so unfortunately it

564
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:12,798
was just calibrating to the high side.

565
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,600
I'll mention that any soils that were

566
00:23:12,798 --> 00:23:19,200
low that so usually traditionally top

567
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:21,199
soils um anything that's low in in

568
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,200
soluble salts really didn't have this

569
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,120
issue because that that lower standard

570
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,519
was

571
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:29,519
accurate. One of the reasons I love

572
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:33,200
Logan and working with Logan is they

573
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:35,759
participate in um something called the

574
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:38,640
NAP, North American Proficiency Testing

575
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:41,519
Program. I believe there's 150

576
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:44,360
participating labs and it's a quality

577
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:47,519
control level between labs.

578
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:49,439
So they do a quarterly blind or double

579
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:52,798
blind statistical evaluation of soil,

580
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:54,000
plant and water samples. And there's

581
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:56,720
essentially, you know, they they're

582
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,200
given a a sample, they run it, and then

583
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:01,279
this NAP program tells them how close

584
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:04,480
they are, how precise they are to the

585
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:06,798
known levels, and they compare it across

586
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:09,919
150 labs. and Logan always has an

587
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:11,359
extremely precise score. Um, so to me

588
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,278
that's always given me confidence with

589
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:15,119
Logan. The problem is those samples are

590
00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:17,278
top soil. They're low in in nutrient

591
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:19,359
concentrations. We're working with

592
00:24:17,278 --> 00:24:21,278
Petebased medias that often were really

593
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:23,879
pushing nutrition and EC quite a bit

594
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:26,240
higher. So they were they kept passing

595
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:28,559
NAP, but that's because it was on that

596
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,240
it was it was a low concentration sample

597
00:24:28,558 --> 00:24:34,079
and we were seeing these issues in high

598
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:35,359
concentration high EC soils.

599
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:39,038
Yeah, that's a great point. And for

600
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:42,240
those unfamiliar as well, u with with

601
00:24:39,038 --> 00:24:43,919
ICP uh machines, you know, we're talking

602
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,880
parts per million here, parts per

603
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:49,159
billion in some cases. So, they're

604
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:52,880
extremely

605
00:24:49,159 --> 00:24:54,799
um I guess accurate in that regard. Now,

606
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:58,480
when we're talking about such small

607
00:24:54,798 --> 00:25:01,359
amounts, there's just greater uh

608
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:04,960
opportunity for sampling error and for

609
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:07,759
other things too to keep in mind. So,

610
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,278
um, one of the things that I always try

611
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:11,200
to emphasize with the growers we work

612
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:13,359
with is if if we have a test result that

613
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:16,798
is just really far off the standard that

614
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:18,479
we expect it to be, then we can always,

615
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:20,879
you know, we can we can always ask Logan

616
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,400
to retest it or we can assume that maybe

617
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,400
something got into that sample that

618
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,880
contaminated it. Maybe there was a p

619
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,400
piece of like fishbone meal for example

620
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,080
that was undissolved and ended up in

621
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,640
there and suddenly our phosphorus levels

622
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:35,038
are just through the roof and our pH has

623
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,720
dropped dramatically or or you know

624
00:25:35,038 --> 00:25:38,960
something like that. So it's always good

625
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,960
to take these tests I think with a small

626
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,278
grain of salt. I think they're the most

627
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:46,558
useful tool that we have agronomically

628
00:25:43,278 --> 00:25:49,200
for making uh data driven decisions

629
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:50,879
about our garden and about our soil. But

630
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,880
it's still not perfect and it's it's

631
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,799
never going to be perfect. And then on

632
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,720
that note, I think, okay, well, so Logan

633
00:25:54,798 --> 00:25:58,558
had this issue. It wasn't really their

634
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:01,759
fault, but unfortunately, it it

635
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:04,000
happened. Um, what about switching to

636
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:07,119
another lab? Well, this could have

637
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,558
happened in any lab. Um, so it's not

638
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:11,359
necessarily unique to them in that

639
00:26:08,558 --> 00:26:13,278
sense. And, um, if you were to switch

640
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:15,038
labs, like I know that's something, you

641
00:26:13,278 --> 00:26:16,400
know, you and I talked about like what

642
00:26:15,038 --> 00:26:18,240
what does that really look like for a

643
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,159
grower? The one thing it does mean is

644
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:23,359
you're really you're starting over. um

645
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:26,159
in a sense you can't take your old Logan

646
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:28,719
tests and then um correlate them with

647
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:30,320
your new tests at the the other the next

648
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,839
lab you go to you know and there's so

649
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:33,439
many labs out there so whatever lab you

650
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:36,798
go with you kind of need to stay with

651
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:39,440
because these test results don't it's

652
00:26:36,798 --> 00:26:41,679
like apples to oranges I guess so I just

653
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,919
wanted to share a little bit more around

654
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:45,120
this idea also anything you want to add

655
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:48,080
yeah I want to add one thing which is

656
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:49,439
that this these issues actually happen

657
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:52,599
at all labs

658
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:55,440
unfortunately. Yeah. And you just don't

659
00:26:52,599 --> 00:26:59,678
know. And so the the reason I've

660
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:01,840
personally committed deeply to uh Logan

661
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:04,880
a is for because of what you're saying

662
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:08,240
so I can really calibrate to one lab and

663
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:12,880
have a very extensive database

664
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:15,440
uh that I'm comfortable with, but also

665
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:17,840
um I can see these issues. I'm I'm so

666
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:19,600
familiar with the data, their process,

667
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:21,678
the people in the lab, everything that

668
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:25,038
when these issues do arise, I can see

669
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:27,200
them and identify them very quickly. And

670
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:29,400
um this is, you know, part of the even

671
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:32,080
though it took a long time to solve the

672
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:33,679
problem, I I was able to help them solve

673
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:34,798
that problem. And so it's sort of it's

674
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:37,120
been a sort of a mutual and

675
00:27:34,798 --> 00:27:39,359
collaborative process. And if you go to

676
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:42,079
another lab and you're just doing, you

677
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:44,240
know, let's say one to even up to a

678
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:46,079
hundred tests per year, you're not

679
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,319
you're not going to see that. And so

680
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:51,199
you're not going to know when issues

681
00:27:47,319 --> 00:27:52,639
arise. So for me and the growers I work

682
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,278
with, I think there's actually a major

683
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,840
benefit to being deeply in committed and

684
00:27:55,278 --> 00:27:59,278
involved with one lab's data set. Um

685
00:27:57,839 --> 00:28:01,678
because at least I know what's

686
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:03,200
happening.

687
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,798
Yeah, I I would guess we see probably

688
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,159
about a thousand tests a year. I'm

689
00:28:04,798 --> 00:28:07,599
guessing you're significantly higher

690
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:10,480
than that with the number of growers you

691
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:13,519
work with. So, you do have this database

692
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:16,880
that builds up over time. And so, um,

693
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:20,158
yeah, if you suddenly see a 20% increase

694
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:21,840
in in your soluble salts across all your

695
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,600
tests starting on this date, that's a

696
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:26,000
really good clue. And I know you're

697
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:29,439
working with Logan for instituting, you

698
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,038
know, even more additional controls.

699
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,320
Yeah. To hopefully catch these sorts of

700
00:28:31,038 --> 00:28:35,038
things in the Yeah, let me mention that.

701
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:36,879
So that the you can recalibrate the

702
00:28:35,038 --> 00:28:38,798
machine over and over again, but if it's

703
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,559
still giving high levels, what does that

704
00:28:38,798 --> 00:28:43,359
mean? And so I actually went back into

705
00:28:40,558 --> 00:28:46,480
our database. So internally,

706
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:49,599
um, we anonymously put all the tests

707
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:52,480
into a database and then we essentially

708
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:54,798
ran statistics looking at the average

709
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,319
levels before and after August of 2024

710
00:28:54,798 --> 00:28:57,918
and that the trend was clear

711
00:28:56,319 --> 00:28:59,839
specifically with sulfur. We also looked

712
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:03,120
at the variation between months, etc.

713
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:04,959
those statistics. And so we're I'm

714
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:07,359
working with them to actually institute

715
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:09,440
another step of of QC where they they

716
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:12,798
look at their own internal database and

717
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:15,798
they just see how close it is

718
00:29:12,798 --> 00:29:18,240
monthtomonth or quarter to quarter.

719
00:29:15,798 --> 00:29:19,679
Um especially when these when these

720
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,278
issues arise, they can just look

721
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:23,360
straight at the straight to the database

722
00:29:21,278 --> 00:29:27,960
instead of continuing to try to figure

723
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:27,959
out the the equipment malfunction.

724
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:33,120
Yeah. Yeah. And if folks have questions

725
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,720
about this, uh, I'd say feel free to

726
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:38,759
reach out to me. I assume you can reach

727
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:41,360
out to you, Brian. Um, or or even Logan

728
00:29:38,759 --> 00:29:44,640
directly. Uh, but this issue has been

729
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:46,000
corrected as of what date? Mid-Marchch.

730
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,440
I don't I'd have to go back and look at

731
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,798
the exact date, but yeah, if you see,

732
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,278
you know, if you have a test and you're

733
00:29:48,798 --> 00:29:52,879
thinking, why is chloride 450 ppm? It's

734
00:29:51,278 --> 00:29:55,359
so that doesn't make any sense to me.

735
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:58,039
It's always been quite a bit lower. and

736
00:29:55,359 --> 00:30:01,359
your test with result was before

737
00:29:58,038 --> 00:30:02,879
mid-Marchch, I would assume um you're

738
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:04,719
fine. You could probably if they still

739
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:07,000
have your sample, they could rerun it

740
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:09,200
for you. Um but

741
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:13,519
ultimately, anything after mid-March

742
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:14,798
will be accurate. Um and I think I've

743
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:16,558
gotten some questions around, well, is

744
00:30:14,798 --> 00:30:18,398
is it how can I still use these tests?

745
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:20,079
Absolutely. I mean, I would just look at

746
00:30:18,398 --> 00:30:21,639
specifically sulfur and chloride with a

747
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:25,038
grain of salt.

748
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:26,399
Um, and you can assume, you know, on

749
00:30:25,038 --> 00:30:29,038
average looking at a few thousand

750
00:30:26,398 --> 00:30:31,439
samples before August of 2024 and and

751
00:30:29,038 --> 00:30:33,119
about a thousand after. The other cat

752
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:36,399
ions are uh there's a lot of

753
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:38,319
variability, but let's just say 25%

754
00:30:36,398 --> 00:30:39,918
elevated. So, it's not going to change

755
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:41,918
your management decisions very

756
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:43,919
dramatically. Um, and you can still use

757
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:46,399
the data and most of the data is still

758
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:48,880
very good. So, that's sort of what I

759
00:30:46,398 --> 00:30:51,439
would say. We wrote a lot of really good

760
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:53,440
recommendations with very small things I

761
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,960
mentioned that um may have been

762
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:58,159
different, but the data is still good.

763
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:59,759
Just take it with a grain of salt.

764
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:01,200
And and the good news in this is if

765
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:03,839
anything you might have underapplied

766
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:06,640
nutrients, which is always

767
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:08,158
uh vastly preferred over overapplied

768
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,799
nutrients. Absolutely. I would have and

769
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:12,000
I if I saw the trend go in the other

770
00:31:10,798 --> 00:31:14,158
direction where I was seeing things

771
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,038
weight artificially low leading to

772
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:18,559
excessive high application rates I would

773
00:31:17,038 --> 00:31:21,679
have taken much more aggressive action

774
00:31:18,558 --> 00:31:23,278
because that's such a higher risk. Um

775
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:27,360
but instead we kind of took the slow

776
00:31:23,278 --> 00:31:30,240
route didn't didn't sort of overreact

777
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:32,719
and and figured it out over time. I also

778
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:35,839
just want to say that I think you and I

779
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:37,038
both are huge believers in transparency

780
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:39,359
and that's why we're actually talking

781
00:31:37,038 --> 00:31:42,960
about it. We want we want people to know

782
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:44,959
this because ultimately I feel like that

783
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,319
is what builds trust and credibility as

784
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,759
opposed to covering things up which

785
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:49,678
again is kind of what happens in other

786
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:51,599
labs. They see internal issues and they

787
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:52,880
fix them but they don't really say

788
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:56,398
anything about it. So I think we were

789
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,360
both eager to actually talk about it.

790
00:31:56,398 --> 00:31:58,719
Yeah. Yeah. And I want to be clear

791
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:00,398
because there was there were a couple

792
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:05,079
growers who reached out to me directly

793
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:08,879
and I was not aware of the full solution

794
00:32:05,079 --> 00:32:13,038
until very recently um within the last

795
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:14,799
oh couple weeks. So um what what I what

796
00:32:13,038 --> 00:32:16,798
I knew prior to that date was I had

797
00:32:14,798 --> 00:32:18,398
reached out to Susan. We had we had

798
00:32:16,798 --> 00:32:20,079
scheduled a meeting. We went we went

799
00:32:18,398 --> 00:32:22,000
through tests. We went through sort of

800
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:24,480
their protocols and how they do these

801
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
tests which was

802
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,599
um which you know was was really

803
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,119
interesting and I learned some things in

804
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:32,398
that process uh which was great but uh

805
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:33,759
you know they hadn't changed any of

806
00:32:32,398 --> 00:32:36,558
their staffing they hadn't changed any

807
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:38,319
of their procedures and so if you had

808
00:32:36,558 --> 00:32:41,200
talked to me prior to you know our

809
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:43,200
conversation Bryant you know a week ago

810
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:45,679
whenever that was I would have told you

811
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:48,558
that like as far as I know I'm not aware

812
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:50,000
of any issues and this is um this this

813
00:32:48,558 --> 00:32:51,519
is where we're at with it. But we we

814
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,038
have seen some inconsistencies with

815
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:54,880
higher numbers. So, I just want to throw

816
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:56,319
that out there because I I do know that

817
00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:00,640
there's some people that have been

818
00:32:56,319 --> 00:33:01,839
pretty vocal about this on online and um

819
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,278
yeah, it's a little bit of vindication

820
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:04,959
for them, but also I want to make sure

821
00:33:03,278 --> 00:33:07,599
that we're approaching it in a way

822
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:12,558
that's solutiondriven, I guess, so we

823
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:15,599
can all continue on. Uh great. So,

824
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:17,200
moving on, you brought up uh you

825
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:18,639
mentioned nitrogen, and I just want to

826
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,319
talk a little bit about nitrogen. I'm

827
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,600
going to I know we have a list here

828
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:25,119
we're working off. I want to jump around

829
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:28,079
a little bit. Um first off, before we

830
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:29,518
dive into your your topic on nitrogen, I

831
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:33,119
wanted to say, can we talk a little bit

832
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:36,079
about how nitrogen cycles and how we see

833
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:38,719
it on on these soil tests and its impact

834
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:42,558
on pH? Because

835
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:44,558
um what we know that that nit that the

836
00:33:42,558 --> 00:33:47,200
cannabis wants nitrogen in the form of

837
00:33:44,558 --> 00:33:49,359
nitrates for the most part and when we

838
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:52,399
first add compost when we first mix our

839
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:55,199
soil so soils we're going to see a low

840
00:33:52,398 --> 00:33:57,199
nitrate number and a you know high what

841
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,600
we would consider a high ammonium

842
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,600
number. Not high relative to the nitrate

843
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:04,079
number. Ammonium you know maybe like a

844
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:06,480
three or a six or something like that.

845
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:08,398
How does that how does that cycling

846
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:11,320
process really work and what is the

847
00:34:08,398 --> 00:34:14,480
impact and implications for a grower?

848
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:17,838
Great. So for the most part growers in

849
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:21,838
living soil organic growers are are only

850
00:34:17,838 --> 00:34:25,519
applying organic forms of nitrogen. So

851
00:34:21,838 --> 00:34:28,799
nitrogen in the form of proteins and

852
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:30,719
amino acids. But let's just say soybean

853
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:34,399
meal, alalfa meal, blood meal, all these

854
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:36,598
are actually full proteins. The biology

855
00:34:34,398 --> 00:34:38,878
in the soil

856
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:41,119
mineralizes those organic forms of

857
00:34:38,878 --> 00:34:42,639
nitrogen into smaller and smaller

858
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:44,320
organic compound. So they take a

859
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:47,679
protein, they turn into amino acid, for

860
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:50,320
example. And uh the plant actually can

861
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:54,320
uptake those organic forms of nitrogen.

862
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:56,879
And um it's not the primary form of

863
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,640
nitrogen that's uptaken even in organic

864
00:34:56,878 --> 00:35:03,440
soils where you're just feeding amino

865
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:05,199
acids and organic compounds, but it is a

866
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,880
a plant available form of nitrogen

867
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:09,118
that's very very beneficial when the

868
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,480
plant does uptake it. And that's

869
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:15,119
typically skipped in the scientific

870
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:19,039
literature because most the I'd say 99%

871
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:21,920
of um studies use the inorganic forms

872
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:23,838
which are ammonium and nitrate. So in

873
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,838
our systems the plants we can assume the

874
00:35:23,838 --> 00:35:27,078
plants are uptaking a certain amount of

875
00:35:25,838 --> 00:35:29,358
organic

876
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:32,760
nitrogen. So once it's turned into

877
00:35:29,358 --> 00:35:36,480
organic nitrogen a different set of

878
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:39,839
biology transforms it into ammonium very

879
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:42,079
very quickly. uh in a in a warm moist

880
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:45,358
soil. This these this transition happens

881
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:48,480
very very quickly. Um and then a

882
00:35:45,358 --> 00:35:51,358
different set of of bacteria convert the

883
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:55,599
ammonium into nitrate. So nitrate is is

884
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:58,239
the final uh form all of the organic

885
00:35:55,599 --> 00:36:01,838
nitrogen we apply to the soil eventually

886
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:03,919
ends up as nitrate. And it's a pretty

887
00:36:01,838 --> 00:36:06,239
quick transition from ammonium to

888
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:09,039
nitrate as well in again with the

889
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:11,039
conditions we're talking about. So, um

890
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:12,880
you can sort of see where your soil is

891
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:14,759
in that mineralization process based on

892
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:18,160
that level of ammonium, that middle

893
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:21,200
step. The weakness of soil testing is it

894
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:23,279
doesn't show us the entire quantity of

895
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:25,118
organic nitrogen in the soil. We're only

896
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:27,119
seeing those final two pools of

897
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:28,720
nitrogen, ammonium, and nitrate. So you

898
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:31,119
can sort of gauge how much nitrogen is

899
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:33,279
in the soil just based on ammonium and

900
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:35,920
nitrate and you can see how mineralized

901
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,400
it is based on how low ammonium is and

902
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,920
how high nitrate

903
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:41,039
is. So I hope that makes sense. I mean

904
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,639
essentially what we're doing is we're

905
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:45,480
just throwing nitrogen into the organic

906
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:48,078
bucket and the biology is transforming

907
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:50,119
it pretty quickly into the nitrate

908
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:53,440
bucket. So when I see

909
00:36:50,119 --> 00:36:55,358
ammonium let's say over two or 3 ppm I

910
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:57,760
can assume that there was some sort of

911
00:36:55,358 --> 00:37:00,078
nitrogen previously applied fairly

912
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:02,720
recently and it's still moving into

913
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:04,320
nitrate. Um it is true that you you

914
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:06,679
definitely so let's say we were in a

915
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:10,200
hydro system and you fed

916
00:37:06,679 --> 00:37:16,239
100% ammonium ammonium sulfate or

917
00:37:10,199 --> 00:37:17,358
something versus 100% nitrate. So, um I

918
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:19,679
don't know, let's just say calcium

919
00:37:17,358 --> 00:37:22,639
nitrate. The the cannabis plant

920
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:25,440
absolutely will perform better uh in the

921
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:26,879
nitrate scenario, but the soils we're

922
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:29,119
working in again, they have a lot of

923
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:31,280
access to amino acids and small organic

924
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:33,200
compounds. The ammonium tends to be

925
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,560
pretty low. The nitrogen or the nitrate

926
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:36,399
tends to be pretty high just because

927
00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:38,400
that conversion process is happening so

928
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,838
quickly. So, you know, in organic

929
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:42,160
systems, you're not actually you don't

930
00:37:39,838 --> 00:37:44,880
really have much control over whether

931
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:47,759
the the nitrogen's in the ammonium or

932
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:49,760
nitrate form other than time. You can

933
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:52,760
wait longer and it'll all convert to

934
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,760
nitrate.

935
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:59,680
Yeah. A couple other things around that

936
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:02,240
that I'd like to add is so we so we have

937
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:04,239
this organic pool of nitrogen that's

938
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:06,479
it's essentially tied up within the

939
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:08,479
microorganisms within the organic matter

940
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:11,280
within these fertilizers that we're

941
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:13,599
adding and it's being converted or cover

942
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:15,119
crops that are breaking down. All those

943
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:17,280
things are going to have nitrogen that's

944
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:18,880
going to slowly be releasing. It's then

945
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,800
this is the organic pool of nitrogen

946
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:23,358
that we can't really measure as

947
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:24,880
effectively. Um, and that's what you're

948
00:38:23,358 --> 00:38:26,639
referring to there. And then it, you

949
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,640
know, converts to ammonium like you

950
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:30,879
said. Now, ammonium,

951
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:32,639
uh, and this is where I want to get some

952
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,320
some clarification from you. Ammonium

953
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:36,960
would put upward pressure on our pH,

954
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:41,039
whereas nitrate being an ani would put

955
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:44,480
negative downward pressure on pH. And

956
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:47,119
where I see ammonium levels on soil

957
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,800
tests is typically when people mix a

958
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:51,680
soil and then send it in for a test

959
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:53,680
right away or when they add compost or

960
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:56,319
organic matter that's not fully

961
00:38:53,679 --> 00:39:00,559
composted. And the implications of that

962
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:02,160
is our our our nitrate nitrates and our

963
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:05,639
nitrogen recommendation is just going to

964
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:08,960
be a little bit harder to dial in.

965
00:39:05,639 --> 00:39:12,639
So, ideally what we like to do with our

966
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:15,599
soil tests is we we mix the soil, we

967
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:17,679
wait two to three weeks in and let me

968
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:19,280
emphasize in warm conditions, if I did

969
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:21,519
this in the winter in a pile outside,

970
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:23,599
that nitrogen's not converting at a very

971
00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:25,519
quick very fast rate and it's not going

972
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:26,800
to it's not going to switch to nitrates.

973
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:28,800
But if we wait, you know, two to three

974
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,400
weeks and then send in our soil test,

975
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,800
the result we get back is going to be

976
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:34,639
more accurate in terms of our nitrate

977
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:38,440
levels, which will allow us to make a

978
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:40,719
better decision about where we're at for

979
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:42,480
nitrogen. And I would assume, and this

980
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:44,239
is where I want your clarification, I

981
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:47,039
would assume our pH would be a little

982
00:39:44,239 --> 00:39:48,719
more accurate, too. Um, I know you and I

983
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:52,400
talked about this, you didn't feel like

984
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:53,679
it it changed pH as much, but I have I

985
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,760
feel like I've seen that a little bit on

986
00:39:53,679 --> 00:39:57,519
tests. I don't know. Yeah. So in a in a

987
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:00,880
living soil there's a well first off

988
00:39:57,519 --> 00:40:02,639
there's way more buffering capacity. Um

989
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:07,039
and also these transitions happen

990
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:10,078
quickly and sort of u non-homogeneously

991
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:14,239
in the soil to a certain extent. So yes

992
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:16,800
in theory if you put down a large

993
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:19,199
application of a fastreleasing nitrogen

994
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:22,160
source that first conversion will drop

995
00:40:19,199 --> 00:40:25,519
the pH. So, if you tested in the middle

996
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:27,279
of um like you amended the soil and

997
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:29,199
immediately took a test, you might see a

998
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:31,400
dip in pH, especially in a soil that's

999
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:34,559
sort of doesn't have a lot of buffering

1000
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:38,240
capacity. But typically, if you wait a

1001
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:39,838
few weeks, a a drop a drop or a raise,

1002
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:42,799
wouldn't you see a raise from Well, so

1003
00:40:39,838 --> 00:40:46,799
you would see an increase uh at first

1004
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:49,119
and then a drop. So, so, but again, I

1005
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:52,240
don't actually see that be in in most

1006
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:53,838
peakbased soils. I just don't I I can't

1007
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:56,239
even think of an instance when I've seen

1008
00:40:53,838 --> 00:40:58,960
that. And I believe that's because I'm

1009
00:40:56,239 --> 00:41:01,679
telling people to to wait um and to let

1010
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:05,280
the full conversion process happen. And

1011
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:09,199
I also just think that uh I'm not even

1012
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:12,960
sure in most soils that that is that

1013
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:15,279
visual. Maybe a couple um ten of a pH

1014
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:18,720
drop. Are you seeing significant pH

1015
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:23,119
drops? Like the soil's at a 68 and it

1016
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:25,199
drops to a 55, that type of thing.

1017
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:28,240
It's hard for me to say because I don't

1018
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:30,000
see enough tests like in a row, you

1019
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:31,838
know, right? two weeks apart or three

1020
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,480
weeks apart to where I can really say.

1021
00:41:31,838 --> 00:41:36,318
But I do see a tra I I do worry that if

1022
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:38,159
I see a high ammonium number and I know

1023
00:41:36,318 --> 00:41:42,480
that's converting to nitrates and I'm

1024
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:44,719
already at a low pH uh you know 63 or

1025
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:47,358
something, I'm worried that that pH as

1026
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:50,078
those nitrates mineralize could

1027
00:41:47,358 --> 00:41:51,920
potentially drop further. I know you're

1028
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:54,000
less concerned about that, but I just

1029
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:56,000
something I was thinking of. One thing I

1030
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,119
do want to highlight though that you

1031
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:01,838
said is that we're we're these soils are

1032
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:03,760
not homogeneous. We're acting like soil

1033
00:42:01,838 --> 00:42:07,440
is homogeneous. It's not. There's all

1034
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:09,480
these different pockets of phes and

1035
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:12,079
mineralization and nutrient

1036
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:13,358
availability, microbes. Um, and I just

1037
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:15,119
think that's important for people to try

1038
00:42:13,358 --> 00:42:16,559
and keep in mind. It's really like it's

1039
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:20,240
like visualizing space. I don't feel

1040
00:42:16,559 --> 00:42:22,960
like we can fully Yeah. understand it.

1041
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:25,919
Um, but also the other thing with this

1042
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:30,000
nitrogen conversion, especially when we

1043
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:31,240
add nutrients to the soil, if we add a

1044
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,280
large amount of

1045
00:42:31,239 --> 00:42:35,919
fertility, we really have to treat it

1046
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:37,839
like a like a thermopilic compost in the

1047
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:40,480
sense that that soil potentially is

1048
00:42:37,838 --> 00:42:42,480
going to heat up uh because the bacteria

1049
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:44,318
is reproducing so rapidly as they get

1050
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:47,559
this food source. And the concern with

1051
00:42:44,318 --> 00:42:51,119
that is that um it's it's going to make

1052
00:42:47,559 --> 00:42:53,039
it inhospitable to plant roots or less

1053
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:54,960
hospitable to plant roots. So that's

1054
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:56,639
another reason when I see a higher

1055
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,480
ammonium number, I say, "Okay, let's not

1056
00:42:56,639 --> 00:43:00,960
plant yet. we need to let the soil cycle

1057
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:02,800
a little further um to allow this

1058
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:05,599
nitrogen to convert. Make sure the soil

1059
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:07,440
temperature is good um not too hot so

1060
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:09,838
that nitrogen Yeah. I think when when a

1061
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,440
soil heats up it's it's just tons of

1062
00:43:09,838 --> 00:43:13,599
cellular respiration happening with the

1063
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:15,519
the bacteria primarily and they're

1064
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:18,000
actually consuming a lot of oxygen. So

1065
00:43:15,519 --> 00:43:19,838
my my fear is you're just you're

1066
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,400
planting into a low oxygen environment

1067
00:43:19,838 --> 00:43:26,159
because the microbes are are using so

1068
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:27,838
much oxygen. Um, and as you mentioned

1069
00:43:26,159 --> 00:43:29,559
previously, definitely a really young

1070
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:31,920
plant isn't going to want a high

1071
00:43:29,559 --> 00:43:34,119
ammonium nitrogen environment. So,

1072
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:36,559
waiting is

1073
00:43:34,119 --> 00:43:38,119
preferable. Um, but I just want to

1074
00:43:36,559 --> 00:43:40,960
emphasize when you put in an organic

1075
00:43:38,119 --> 00:43:43,838
nitrogen, the the net change in pH

1076
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:45,358
should be zero. So, yes, you're going to

1077
00:43:43,838 --> 00:43:48,880
get you're going to get a fluctuation

1078
00:43:45,358 --> 00:43:51,759
boop boop. But that con conversion

1079
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:54,160
process is quick. It's super dynamic.

1080
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:56,960
And so to try to manage the pH during

1081
00:43:54,159 --> 00:43:58,559
that blip of time uh doesn't make sense

1082
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:01,159
to me because it should start at seven

1083
00:43:58,559 --> 00:44:05,358
and end at seven for example.

1084
00:44:01,159 --> 00:44:08,639
Um now if you were using an if if you

1085
00:44:05,358 --> 00:44:09,719
use an a nonorganic form of nitrogen

1086
00:44:08,639 --> 00:44:12,960
it's

1087
00:44:09,719 --> 00:44:17,239
different. So but we're primarily

1088
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:17,240
talking about organic amendments here.

1089
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:21,920
Yeah. Yeah, I guess the context for me

1090
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:26,079
is more like I see a soil test on

1091
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:28,079
freshly mixed soil that is a low pH,

1092
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:29,280
high ammonium, I worry that it may drop

1093
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:32,720
a little further because we don't know

1094
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:34,720
where we're starting with that mix. Um

1095
00:44:32,719 --> 00:44:36,159
whereas like you said with remendment

1096
00:44:34,719 --> 00:44:38,559
with nitrogen, that makes that makes a

1097
00:44:36,159 --> 00:44:40,879
lot of sense. That's really useful. Now,

1098
00:44:38,559 --> 00:44:44,400
one thing that you also uh wanted to

1099
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:46,640
talk about was why nitrogen targets in

1100
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:49,358
living soil that's being used multiple

1101
00:44:46,639 --> 00:44:50,960
rounds might be different than other

1102
00:44:49,358 --> 00:44:52,318
cultivation. Yeah, this is this is

1103
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,318
something that I think is an important

1104
00:44:52,318 --> 00:44:56,679
point that I've thought about a lot

1105
00:44:54,318 --> 00:45:01,279
honestly for years.

1106
00:44:56,679 --> 00:45:05,039
the a soil fresh out of the bag. Um, you

1107
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:07,200
know, my target level of nitrogen, which

1108
00:45:05,039 --> 00:45:09,199
is should should totally be based on the

1109
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:12,078
soil volume per plant, the length of

1110
00:45:09,199 --> 00:45:14,559
time the plant is in the soil, um, how

1111
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:18,560
much supplemental feeding is done, etc.

1112
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:21,039
But generally speaking, 100 to 150 ppm

1113
00:45:18,559 --> 00:45:22,559
of nitrate nitrogen, low ammonium shows

1114
00:45:21,039 --> 00:45:24,480
that the soil is fully mineralized.

1115
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:26,400
That's a really good target number.

1116
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:28,159
Every time I test a fresh kiss soil,

1117
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:30,119
it's somewhere, you know, approximately

1118
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:33,679
in that range. Um,

1119
00:45:30,119 --> 00:45:36,000
also one nuance here. F testing a fresh

1120
00:45:33,679 --> 00:45:37,838
soil out of the bag is going to be less

1121
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,119
accurate than testing a soil after it's

1122
00:45:37,838 --> 00:45:41,199
been through a round. It's just always

1123
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:43,838
less homogeneous even if you mix it

1124
00:45:41,199 --> 00:45:45,719
super super well. But point being, if

1125
00:45:43,838 --> 00:45:49,279
you're somewhere in that, let's say, 100

1126
00:45:45,719 --> 00:45:50,879
ppm, 125 ppm range, that's a lot of

1127
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:53,839
nitrogen.

1128
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:56,000
What happens though if you use the soil,

1129
00:45:53,838 --> 00:45:57,838
let's say 10 rounds in a row, is every

1130
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:02,599
round you're applying more organic

1131
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:06,078
nitrogen, more alphaalfpha meal, um more

1132
00:46:02,599 --> 00:46:08,119
compost, more granular poultry manure,

1133
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:12,400
whatever.

1134
00:46:08,119 --> 00:46:14,000
And the majority of that nitrogen in

1135
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:16,800
that in those amendments and that

1136
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:19,599
compost does get broken down within a

1137
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:21,200
round, but a lot of it remains because

1138
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:22,800
of two things. The carbon to nitrogen

1139
00:46:21,199 --> 00:46:24,639
ratio and the particle size. So if you

1140
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:27,119
put in a big wood, if you put drop a

1141
00:46:24,639 --> 00:46:30,000
wood chip into the soil, that's going to

1142
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:32,559
take a fairly long time to mineralize

1143
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,880
and to to decompose in your soil

1144
00:46:32,559 --> 00:46:37,039
compared to a tiny little particle of

1145
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:39,119
blood meal, which is really really high

1146
00:46:37,039 --> 00:46:41,599
in nitrogen, low in carbon, and has a

1147
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:43,760
small particle size. So as you put in

1148
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:45,359
all this organic nitrogen over time, not

1149
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:48,160
all of it's releasing, and you start to

1150
00:46:45,358 --> 00:46:51,358
build this reservoir of organic nitrogen

1151
00:46:48,159 --> 00:46:55,838
that's releasing slowly. And so over

1152
00:46:51,358 --> 00:46:58,318
many rounds, you actually have this this

1153
00:46:55,838 --> 00:47:00,239
large reservoir of nitrogen that is

1154
00:46:58,318 --> 00:47:02,559
releasing slowly that we're not seeing

1155
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:05,519
on a soil test. And so in general, I

1156
00:47:02,559 --> 00:47:07,279
think growers who are who are on

1157
00:47:05,519 --> 00:47:08,960
multiple rounds in the same soil can

1158
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:12,880
start to lower their nitrogen target

1159
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:15,838
well below 125 ppm. Um, and I've gotten

1160
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:18,240
feedback from growers who are in, you

1161
00:47:15,838 --> 00:47:20,559
know, around 25,

1162
00:47:18,239 --> 00:47:22,879
uh, that that my nitrogen target is

1163
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:25,358
feels a little too high in their soils

1164
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:28,640
and that they're actually getting really

1165
00:47:25,358 --> 00:47:31,519
good results with, uh, and their plants

1166
00:47:28,639 --> 00:47:34,078
are are finishing at a at a coloration

1167
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:35,920
they like, a greenness level they like

1168
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:37,760
with much much lower levels. And I just

1169
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,519
think that's because they have 25 rounds

1170
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:41,280
of alphalfpha meal application that's

1171
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:43,519
still slowly mineralizing. So for

1172
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:46,160
example in aronomy you assume that 50%

1173
00:47:43,519 --> 00:47:49,000
of a compost would become available in

1174
00:47:46,159 --> 00:47:51,759
year one 25 the next year

1175
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:53,639
25% the third year. So we can sort of

1176
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:56,480
think of it as that if there's sort of a

1177
00:47:53,639 --> 00:47:59,719
staggering release rate across some of

1178
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,719
these amendments.

1179
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:06,000
Yeah, I would expect release rates to be

1180
00:48:03,199 --> 00:48:09,358
faster in soilless media because we

1181
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:11,920
have, you know, more biology

1182
00:48:09,358 --> 00:48:13,199
uh warmer temperatures and controlled

1183
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:15,599
environment agriculture, you know,

1184
00:48:13,199 --> 00:48:18,318
indoors. But I think the principle of it

1185
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:22,160
absolutely just think of that 50 2525 as

1186
00:48:18,318 --> 00:48:24,800
a principle and not as as a as a rule to

1187
00:48:22,159 --> 00:48:27,799
follow in in the soils we're talking

1188
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,800
about.

1189
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:32,960
Uh yeah, I don't know have a lot to add

1190
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,318
to that. I think that's really

1191
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:36,400
interesting and I think that's a very

1192
00:48:34,318 --> 00:48:37,960
good point and we do, you know, we see

1193
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:41,119
the same thing.

1194
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:43,519
Um and the nice thing about nitrogen is

1195
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:45,440
it's pretty easy to add and it's pretty

1196
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:47,400
easy to visually see symptoms of. It's

1197
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:49,838
it's the easiest

1198
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:53,280
deficiency well and maybe even toxicity

1199
00:48:49,838 --> 00:48:55,199
to really uh see in your plants. And too

1200
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:56,240
much nitrogen, you're going to you're

1201
00:48:55,199 --> 00:48:58,598
going to have issues. You're going to

1202
00:48:56,239 --> 00:49:01,679
see the the clawing. you're going to see

1203
00:48:58,599 --> 00:49:04,318
um you know lower yields potentially

1204
00:49:01,679 --> 00:49:06,558
greater pest pressure. So really having

1205
00:49:04,318 --> 00:49:08,079
proper levels of nitrogen is is

1206
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:10,960
important. And then if you need to add

1207
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:13,920
nitrogen um I mean fish hydraulicates

1208
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:16,159
probably my favorite quick liquid feed

1209
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:18,639
that's affordable and not you know

1210
00:49:16,159 --> 00:49:20,719
you're not buying a a marketing branded

1211
00:49:18,639 --> 00:49:23,519
product I guess. Yeah absolutely say

1212
00:49:20,719 --> 00:49:25,000
that's one of two options I love. I I'd

1213
00:49:23,519 --> 00:49:28,838
also

1214
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:31,760
um say that to me the the

1215
00:49:28,838 --> 00:49:34,558
best the be the best way to create your

1216
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:38,079
own internal nitrogen targets internal

1217
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:41,519
meaning in your own operation is to is

1218
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:44,800
to just judge your plants at harvest.

1219
00:49:41,519 --> 00:49:46,880
Did they fade too too fast and too early

1220
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:50,160
or are they too green and too

1221
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:52,240
vegetative, too leafy at harvest? and

1222
00:49:50,159 --> 00:49:54,719
and look at where your nitrogen is and

1223
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:56,000
kind of adjust from there. Um, I tell

1224
00:49:54,719 --> 00:49:57,279
people this all the time where it's

1225
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,960
like, I'm going to recommend a certain

1226
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:00,800
amount of nitrogen to hit the the

1227
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:02,400
nitrogen target, but ultimately you

1228
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:04,680
should be reading your plants like you

1229
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:08,160
said. And I think just where your last

1230
00:50:04,679 --> 00:50:11,159
round ended is is the best metric for

1231
00:50:08,159 --> 00:50:11,159
that.

1232
00:50:11,838 --> 00:50:16,719
Yeah, my last round, which I shared on

1233
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:18,319
Instagram if people want to see, but um

1234
00:50:16,719 --> 00:50:20,799
I felt like I finished a little high in

1235
00:50:18,318 --> 00:50:23,039
nitrogen. So, I'll I'll go through get

1236
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:25,359
the test, get the recommendation, and

1237
00:50:23,039 --> 00:50:27,519
then I I'll probably take my nitrogen

1238
00:50:25,358 --> 00:50:30,759
target and adjust it down by Exactly.

1239
00:50:27,519 --> 00:50:33,280
That's exactly right. And

1240
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:34,880
then, but I I'll still work off the same

1241
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:36,400
target and then I'll just lower it and

1242
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:39,280
then I'll see how that round goes. And

1243
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:40,880
if it's if it's still high, you know, if

1244
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:42,640
it if it's high, then I can adjust it

1245
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:44,559
down further. Or if it starts to get low

1246
00:50:42,639 --> 00:50:45,679
and I find I have to apply something.

1247
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:47,200
The other thing, you know, you could

1248
00:50:45,679 --> 00:50:50,799
look at is is blood meal would be

1249
00:50:47,199 --> 00:50:54,078
another pretty fast um nitrogen source

1250
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:55,359
that you mentioned. Um so yeah, you can

1251
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:57,640
just make adjustments like that. I think

1252
00:50:55,358 --> 00:50:59,920
that's a really good point.

1253
00:50:57,639 --> 00:51:01,358
Um, something that's not on your list of

1254
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,720
topics, but something I wanted to talk

1255
00:51:01,358 --> 00:51:05,838
about because I've been thinking a lot

1256
00:51:02,719 --> 00:51:09,598
about it lately is is rock dusts in

1257
00:51:05,838 --> 00:51:11,759
living soils. I know um certain mixes

1258
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:14,000
like the Coot mix for example recommends

1259
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:15,680
pretty high levels of rock dust and

1260
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,800
people are always worried about getting

1261
00:51:15,679 --> 00:51:20,558
their trace minerals.

1262
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:23,039
Now my lately the way I've been

1263
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:25,200
approaching it is one, you know,

1264
00:51:23,039 --> 00:51:29,039
particle size is king here. The smaller

1265
00:51:25,199 --> 00:51:30,318
the particle size, the sooner these, you

1266
00:51:29,039 --> 00:51:32,639
know, these rock dust will become

1267
00:51:30,318 --> 00:51:34,239
available. But the amount of time it

1268
00:51:32,639 --> 00:51:35,679
would take for the microbes to break it

1269
00:51:34,239 --> 00:51:36,598
down for, you know, any sort of

1270
00:51:35,679 --> 00:51:38,118
weathering

1271
00:51:36,599 --> 00:51:40,720
and

1272
00:51:38,119 --> 00:51:44,079
mineralization is not a timeline that I

1273
00:51:40,719 --> 00:51:45,598
want for like production cannabis. Um,

1274
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:47,519
just because it's such an unknown

1275
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:49,119
variable. And then I worry that all of

1276
00:51:47,519 --> 00:51:50,960
these rock dusts are bringing in some

1277
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:52,800
level of heavy metals. And I'm just so

1278
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:55,679
hypervigilant about heavy metals these

1279
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:58,318
days with um you know working with law

1280
00:51:55,679 --> 00:52:00,440
facilities that are regulated for it

1281
00:51:58,318 --> 00:52:04,079
that I'm more inclined to lean

1282
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:05,920
towards sulfates or um you know just a

1283
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:08,400
tiny amount of rock dust, a tiny amount

1284
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:09,680
of kelp meal. Um I don't know what what

1285
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:12,160
are your thoughts on I know I'm throwing

1286
00:52:09,679 --> 00:52:14,558
a curveball here.

1287
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:16,480
never recommend rock dust or kelpmeal in

1288
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:19,640
cannabis production primarily for a

1289
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:22,880
concern around heavy metals but

1290
00:52:19,639 --> 00:52:26,239
also I do not see them as a replacement

1291
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:28,000
for micronutrient sulfates and when I

1292
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:30,558
say micronutrients I'm talking about the

1293
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:34,039
five essential micronutrients iron

1294
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:37,599
manganesees zinc copper and boron there

1295
00:52:34,039 --> 00:52:40,318
are dozens of non-essential trace

1296
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:42,559
minerals that are brought in with rock

1297
00:52:40,318 --> 00:52:45,358
dust and kelp meal

1298
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:47,119
um that the plant doesn't need but in

1299
00:52:45,358 --> 00:52:49,279
theory would make it stronger, could be

1300
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:52,358
a bio stimulant, could feed biology,

1301
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:55,119
could make some kind of expression

1302
00:52:52,358 --> 00:52:58,159
happen. But personally, I've I've used

1303
00:52:55,119 --> 00:53:02,000
rock dust and and kelp meal for over a

1304
00:52:58,159 --> 00:53:05,838
decade in my own growing, and I've never

1305
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:07,119
seen um amazing crop responses or any

1306
00:53:05,838 --> 00:53:09,440
I've actually never seen anything from

1307
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:10,960
rock dust. I've seen stuff from kelmeal,

1308
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:12,880
but kelp meal also has a little bit of

1309
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:14,559
nitrogen in it and quite a bit of

1310
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:17,838
potassium, so it's tough to know exactly

1311
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:21,200
where that response is coming from. Um,

1312
00:53:17,838 --> 00:53:23,599
but in general, you apply you apply

1313
00:53:21,199 --> 00:53:26,318
these products for the non-essential

1314
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:29,039
trace minerals, you're never going to

1315
00:53:26,318 --> 00:53:30,960
get a high enough quantity of the five

1316
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:33,838
essential micronutrients from those

1317
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:36,159
products. So, they may help. They may be

1318
00:53:33,838 --> 00:53:39,279
bio- stimulating. They generally don't

1319
00:53:36,159 --> 00:53:40,639
hurt except when they're used in high

1320
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:43,040
quantities. You can run into issues with

1321
00:53:40,639 --> 00:53:45,039
heav heavy metals. So, I'm not adamantly

1322
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:48,480
against them, but I think that growers

1323
00:53:45,039 --> 00:53:50,239
often want to skip the the micronutrient

1324
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:52,639
sulfates, the iron sulfate, manganese

1325
00:53:50,239 --> 00:53:54,719
sulfate, soluble, that type of stuff,

1326
00:53:52,639 --> 00:53:58,719
and use rock dust instead. And it's just

1327
00:53:54,719 --> 00:54:01,439
not a a onetoone replacement. Um, and

1328
00:53:58,719 --> 00:54:03,279
I'll also mention that growers don't

1329
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:05,039
like the micronutrient sulfates, which I

1330
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:06,640
sort of understand why intuitively if

1331
00:54:05,039 --> 00:54:09,599
you use them and you look at them, they

1332
00:54:06,639 --> 00:54:11,279
they just don't feel that natural. So to

1333
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:12,880
put them in a living soil feels weird,

1334
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:15,079
especially copper sulfate, it's got that

1335
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:17,920
weird blue color.

1336
00:54:15,079 --> 00:54:20,920
Um, and but generally they express that

1337
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:24,159
concern around sulfur. you're

1338
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:26,559
applying orders of magnitude more sulfur

1339
00:54:24,159 --> 00:54:29,199
with the use of gypsum which is not

1340
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:30,559
villainized in cannabis production to

1341
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:33,279
the same extent the micronutrient

1342
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:35,040
sulfates are. So,

1343
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:36,640
um, if you're trying to you, you know,

1344
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:38,159
minimize sulfur, you really have to sort

1345
00:54:36,639 --> 00:54:41,519
of eliminate gypsum and potassium

1346
00:54:38,159 --> 00:54:44,239
sulfate and langite and epsom salt way

1347
00:54:41,519 --> 00:54:47,280
before you eliminate manganese sulfate,

1348
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:50,000
which I'm recommending at two teaspoons.

1349
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:52,079
Um, just very tiny quantities, just a

1350
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:54,639
couple grams in an entire cubic yard of

1351
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:57,039
soil volume. So uh yeah I don't that's

1352
00:54:54,639 --> 00:55:00,679
why I don't recommend

1353
00:54:57,039 --> 00:55:00,679
uh rock dust

1354
00:55:01,199 --> 00:55:05,919
and when you are getting trace minerals

1355
00:55:03,838 --> 00:55:07,599
from your compost fraction in your soil

1356
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:10,880
too that's probably and all the other

1357
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:12,400
amendments from bone meals and anything

1358
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:15,760
from the ocean has a huge amount of

1359
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:19,119
these trace minerals uh you know

1360
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:21,040
alphalfpha meal all it's got it all in

1361
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:23,358
really small quantities and generally

1362
00:55:21,039 --> 00:55:25,599
the trace minerals that aren't essential

1363
00:55:23,358 --> 00:55:27,358
if they're going to work, if they're

1364
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:29,920
going to do anything, they're needed in

1365
00:55:27,358 --> 00:55:31,440
extremely small quantities anyway. So,

1366
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:33,318
you should be in these soils that were

1367
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:35,920
amending heavily and that have tons of

1368
00:55:33,318 --> 00:55:37,558
compost, there should be plenty of these

1369
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:40,400
trace minerals.

1370
00:55:37,559 --> 00:55:43,519
Um, now that said, I may be a little bit

1371
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:46,559
of a hypocrite because before I planted

1372
00:55:43,519 --> 00:55:48,920
a thousand trees on my farm, I

1373
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:52,000
definitely threw in a little bit of

1374
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:54,159
of just small small quantity of rock

1375
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,679
dust. Um, but, you know, that's mostly

1376
00:55:54,159 --> 00:55:59,440
because I just had it lying around and I

1377
00:55:55,679 --> 00:56:02,719
wanted to use it. It I I would not bet a

1378
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:04,639
dollar that it's actually doing anything

1379
00:56:02,719 --> 00:56:06,480
to my trees.

1380
00:56:04,639 --> 00:56:08,078
People can disagree with me and that's

1381
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:12,280
totally fine. It's just I'm just

1382
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:12,280
speaking to my own experience here.

1383
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:18,720
Yeah, I did some trials when we were

1384
00:56:16,159 --> 00:56:21,279
remending uh or creating our nutrient

1385
00:56:18,719 --> 00:56:23,519
pack and I had with long conversations

1386
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:25,119
with Coot back in the day, we did some

1387
00:56:23,519 --> 00:56:27,039
trials at the local horiculture college

1388
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:28,960
and one of them on his recommendation

1389
00:56:27,039 --> 00:56:30,558
was high levels of rock dust for the

1390
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:32,798
remendment with the idea of getting

1391
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:36,400
these trace minerals and basically there

1392
00:56:32,798 --> 00:56:37,920
just was inadequate fertility because

1393
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:40,720
there there there was no available

1394
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:42,159
nutrients in it and um so we've kind of

1395
00:56:40,719 --> 00:56:44,558
we've kind I've kind of moved away from

1396
00:56:42,159 --> 00:56:45,838
rock dust philosophically for the same

1397
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:47,200
reasons you're listing and I just

1398
00:56:45,838 --> 00:56:48,400
thought it was I thought it was an

1399
00:56:47,199 --> 00:56:49,519
interesting topic because a lot of

1400
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:53,200
people have been asking me about

1401
00:56:49,519 --> 00:56:55,039
azimite. I mean, yeah, sorry. I think

1402
00:56:53,199 --> 00:56:57,838
kelmeal definitely does. Kelmeal has all

1403
00:56:55,039 --> 00:57:00,960
kinds of bioimulating effects um and

1404
00:56:57,838 --> 00:57:02,798
hormonal effects and like I said, it has

1405
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:05,440
nitrogen and a lot of potassium. So,

1406
00:57:02,798 --> 00:57:06,920
kelme is a more complicated topic. Uh

1407
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:11,119
it's also much more

1408
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:13,920
available. Um, but it but to me the the

1409
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:16,880
the rate, you know, the dose makes the

1410
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:19,960
poison and the rate, for whatever

1411
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:23,440
reason, kelpmeal rates in cannabis

1412
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:24,960
production are just generally too high.

1413
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,559
Uh, you're also bringing in a ton of

1414
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:28,318
sodium and chloride if you apply it in

1415
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:32,319
really high quantities. So, less is more

1416
00:57:28,318 --> 00:57:34,318
with kelpmeal. I'm not as clearly uh I'm

1417
00:57:32,318 --> 00:57:36,480
not anti- kelpmeal. I just think you

1418
00:57:34,318 --> 00:57:37,920
want to watch the quantity. Also, just,

1419
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:39,199
you know, there's a lot of arsenic, so

1420
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:42,079
if you're getting tested, you don't want

1421
00:57:39,199 --> 00:57:44,399
to use it in high quantities. Um, and

1422
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:47,359
any bio- stimulant should be acting in

1423
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,358
in a very low

1424
00:57:49,639 --> 00:57:53,679
dose. What one note to add to all this

1425
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:56,798
is if you do want to play around with

1426
00:57:53,679 --> 00:57:59,679
these micronutrient sulfates, uh, I

1427
00:57:56,798 --> 00:58:02,000
would highly suggest you don't add

1428
00:57:59,679 --> 00:58:04,639
anything without a soil test to go off

1429
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:07,119
of. And if you do add anything, we are

1430
00:58:04,639 --> 00:58:08,558
talking minute amounts because you can

1431
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:11,358
absolutely screw up your soil with

1432
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:12,559
toxicities by adding too much. So, um,

1433
00:58:11,358 --> 00:58:14,558
and you really have to know what you're

1434
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:17,040
doing because like soluble for example

1435
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:19,280
is significantly stronger than borax.

1436
00:58:17,039 --> 00:58:21,039
So, if if you screw up for some reason

1437
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:22,640
and grab soluble on a borax

1438
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:26,079
recommendation, you can way overdo your

1439
00:58:22,639 --> 00:58:27,679
boron. So, just be careful playing math

1440
00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:29,920
scientist with micronutrients. There's

1441
00:58:27,679 --> 00:58:32,558
also a spectrum within them. you know,

1442
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:35,760
you can apply quite a bit of ferrris,

1443
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:39,280
you know, iron sulfate, but um not so

1444
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:40,799
much copper or boron. So, and what my

1445
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:43,119
just to kind of run through it, when I

1446
00:58:40,798 --> 00:58:45,759
use micronutrient sulfates, I dissolve

1447
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:49,760
them in water. I add a carbon source of

1448
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:51,839
some kind. So, typically that's um a

1449
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:53,799
humic substance, like a dissolvable

1450
00:58:51,838 --> 00:58:57,440
humic acid or

1451
00:58:53,798 --> 00:59:00,480
molasses. Uh and

1452
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:03,039
uh maybe to go back to this

1453
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:06,079
conversation, a kelp is a a source of

1454
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:08,079
carbon. So, just a touch of of kelp. Um,

1455
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:09,760
and then I and then I always apply it in

1456
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:12,318
water because it's distributed more

1457
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:15,599
evenly than you never apply them dry.

1458
00:59:12,318 --> 00:59:17,480
So, I I inject it into my irrigation

1459
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:20,240
system.

1460
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:22,318
Um, so anyway, that the theory there is

1461
00:59:20,239 --> 00:59:24,719
you're you may be chelating a little bit

1462
00:59:22,318 --> 00:59:26,480
with a carbon source. You're also

1463
00:59:24,719 --> 00:59:28,480
buffering it biologically a little bit.

1464
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:30,960
So you're giving the microbes something

1465
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:33,280
to eat with it. So you're, you know,

1466
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:36,000
when the the microbes consume the carbon

1467
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:38,640
or the sugar source, um, they may be

1468
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:41,838
incorporating those those micronutrients

1469
00:59:38,639 --> 00:59:44,239
into their bodies. Um, and that's a

1470
00:59:41,838 --> 00:59:45,920
that's a that remains that keeps those

1471
00:59:44,239 --> 00:59:47,919
micronutrients in a more plant available

1472
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:50,159
form longer because they you're

1473
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:53,280
essentially taking an inorganic salt and

1474
00:59:50,159 --> 00:59:54,960
turning it into an organic form. Um, and

1475
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:56,960
the the issue with some of these, like

1476
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:59,519
iron sulfate specifically, but a little

1477
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:01,440
bit manganese sulfate, too, is is redux

1478
00:59:59,519 --> 01:00:04,719
matters a lot. So, most of if you just

1479
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:08,318
drench iron sulfate straight into a a

1480
01:00:04,719 --> 01:00:10,480
soil with a pH over six or 65, it'll

1481
01:00:08,318 --> 01:00:12,000
immediately oxidize and just rust, turns

1482
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:14,880
to rust, and it's not plant available.

1483
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:17,119
So, trying to chilate specifically iron

1484
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:20,838
or put it into a more organic form will

1485
01:00:17,119 --> 01:00:20,838
keep it available longer.

1486
01:00:22,798 --> 01:00:27,719
That's a really great point around iron.

1487
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:30,960
Yeah, thank you for reminding folks of

1488
01:00:27,719 --> 01:00:32,798
that. Um, yeah, I just I just take like

1489
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:34,720
for I recently did a manganese sulfate

1490
01:00:32,798 --> 01:00:36,480
application. I I just mixed it with

1491
01:00:34,719 --> 01:00:39,279
water and then applied it over the top

1492
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:42,000
of my beds uh with a just a sprinkler

1493
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:44,000
can even. But I I haven't I hadn't

1494
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,559
thought about adding a little bit of

1495
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,920
molasses or some other carbon source in

1496
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:51,359
there. So, I might have to experiment

1497
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:51,358
with that. That's a good idea.

1498
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:58,359
Um okay moving on then let's talk a

1499
01:00:54,079 --> 01:01:01,119
little bit about uh

1500
01:00:58,358 --> 01:01:05,598
transpiration in plants and what role

1501
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:08,720
that plays in sort of yeah fun so it's

1502
01:01:05,599 --> 01:01:10,400
you know I I think about nutrition a lot

1503
01:01:08,719 --> 01:01:12,000
and I look at a lot of tissue tests

1504
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:13,000
we've been talking about soil and I I

1505
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,920
really look

1506
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:18,400
at a lot of tissue tests next to soil

1507
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:19,880
tests and it's always bothered me a

1508
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:23,680
little bit that they're not perfectly

1509
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:26,160
correlated. And so I spend a lot of time

1510
01:01:23,679 --> 01:01:27,679
trying to understand why if you have

1511
01:01:26,159 --> 01:01:30,159
great sufficiency and balance in the

1512
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:33,399
soil, it doesn't always translate into

1513
01:01:30,159 --> 01:01:36,078
the right sufficiency in plant leaves.

1514
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:39,920
And I've always known that the the

1515
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:42,920
biggest reason is is transpiration. Um

1516
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:47,280
although there's other factors, too.

1517
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:50,000
And so I've I've gone into sort of the

1518
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:53,040
the science of what causes transpiration

1519
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:54,358
and it there's a lot of misconception

1520
01:01:53,039 --> 01:01:56,480
um in

1521
01:01:54,358 --> 01:01:58,400
horiculture around what drives

1522
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:59,880
transpiration. So for example, you know,

1523
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:03,599
I've always thought like

1524
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:07,119
VPD drives transpiration rate, but

1525
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:09,760
that's actually not uh that not quite

1526
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:12,400
accurate. the if you really dive into

1527
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:15,280
the physics of plants and energy uh

1528
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:19,200
energy to the leaves drives evaporation

1529
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:21,760
from the leaves and so that's radiation

1530
01:02:19,199 --> 01:02:26,838
energy and convection so air movement

1531
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:29,599
warm air um and and then

1532
01:02:26,838 --> 01:02:31,440
sunlight and that that is ultimately

1533
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:33,680
what's going to drive the rate of

1534
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:35,679
evaporation out of leaves and then the

1535
01:02:33,679 --> 01:02:38,078
final thing to note is the stomata have

1536
01:02:35,679 --> 01:02:40,078
to be open so relative humidity does

1537
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:42,160
play a role in that. Temperature plays a

1538
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:44,400
role in that, but ultimately it's the

1539
01:02:42,159 --> 01:02:47,558
it's the differential in vapor pressure

1540
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:49,400
inside the leaf versus outside the leaf.

1541
01:02:47,559 --> 01:02:51,599
Um,

1542
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:53,200
but ultimately you're you're you're

1543
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:54,720
changing your evaporation rate based on

1544
01:02:53,199 --> 01:02:56,719
the total energy hitting the leaf.

1545
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:59,759
During the day when the lights are on or

1546
01:02:56,719 --> 01:03:02,318
when the sun is out, the the majority of

1547
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:05,839
that energy is

1548
01:03:02,318 --> 01:03:09,679
uh radiation. It's from light. And so in

1549
01:03:05,838 --> 01:03:12,239
a sense the uh VPD doesn't actually

1550
01:03:09,679 --> 01:03:14,159
matter nearly as much during the day. It

1551
01:03:12,239 --> 01:03:15,759
matters more at night because convection

1552
01:03:14,159 --> 01:03:17,679
is the only source of energy driving

1553
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:19,839
transpiration. But during the day, light

1554
01:03:17,679 --> 01:03:22,719
intensity and whether or not the stomata

1555
01:03:19,838 --> 01:03:24,719
are open are the key variables to to the

1556
01:03:22,719 --> 01:03:26,639
rate of transpiration.

1557
01:03:24,719 --> 01:03:28,959
Um, so anyway, I'm kind of going too far

1558
01:03:26,639 --> 01:03:30,759
into the weeds here, but if you think

1559
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:32,798
about how plants uptake

1560
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:35,520
nutrients, sufficiency and balance in

1561
01:03:32,798 --> 01:03:38,159
the soil absolutely matters, but the but

1562
01:03:35,519 --> 01:03:40,400
the rate of evaporation out of the

1563
01:03:38,159 --> 01:03:42,558
leaves is is the second thing that we

1564
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:44,400
don't quantify, we often don't really

1565
01:03:42,559 --> 01:03:46,160
think about, but is ultimately going to

1566
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:50,798
determine how many nutrients are moving

1567
01:03:46,159 --> 01:03:52,798
into the plant. Um so for example I just

1568
01:03:50,798 --> 01:03:55,280
see really poor

1569
01:03:52,798 --> 01:03:57,119
uh correlation between calcium and boron

1570
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:59,519
immobile nutrients in the plant tissue

1571
01:03:57,119 --> 01:04:04,358
and how much is in the soil and that's

1572
01:03:59,519 --> 01:04:04,358
totally because of transpiration rates

1573
01:04:07,039 --> 01:04:12,240
because they move with Exactly. So, as

1574
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:16,079
soon as evaporation stops, you're not

1575
01:04:12,239 --> 01:04:18,399
getting calcium uptake. And um maybe not

1576
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:21,359
in indoor environments as much as

1577
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:23,160
definitely in greenhouse environments.

1578
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:25,838
Growers don't think about nighttime

1579
01:04:23,159 --> 01:04:27,598
evaporation, but as soon as there

1580
01:04:25,838 --> 01:04:29,279
there's tons of heat emission coming off

1581
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:30,960
of the plant leaves, and so plant leaves

1582
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:34,319
cool down, especially when they're

1583
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:36,480
exposed to the open sky at night. And so

1584
01:04:34,318 --> 01:04:38,079
the the leaf temperature can drop.

1585
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:39,920
You're not getting any radiation. And

1586
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:42,160
evaporation can essentially stop at

1587
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:44,079
night, which is a major problem for

1588
01:04:42,159 --> 01:04:46,960
creating weak cells at the top of the

1589
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:49,599
plant, increases disease susceptibility,

1590
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:50,960
but also just stops nutrient transport.

1591
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:53,200
And you want nutrient transport

1592
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:55,760
happening 24 hours a day. So there's a

1593
01:04:53,199 --> 01:04:59,558
number of issues around evaporation

1594
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:59,559
um that I think about.

1595
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:09,200
So I've always thought of it a little

1596
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:12,358
bit differently in the sense that um

1597
01:05:09,199 --> 01:05:13,879
evapot transpiration is being pushed

1598
01:05:12,358 --> 01:05:19,119
by

1599
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:21,358
VPD as well as um air flow across the

1600
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:23,318
leaf surface because that higher levels

1601
01:05:21,358 --> 01:05:26,719
of air flow if you have a plant near a

1602
01:05:23,318 --> 01:05:29,038
fan and then you start to get that that

1603
01:05:26,719 --> 01:05:31,838
uh leaf tip burn essentially is is a

1604
01:05:29,039 --> 01:05:33,599
lack of calcium um that's developing is

1605
01:05:31,838 --> 01:05:36,558
because the plant can't evapot

1606
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:38,240
transanspirate fast enough to

1607
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:40,000
accommodate the amount of nutrients that

1608
01:05:38,239 --> 01:05:42,558
are going up through the leaf and so

1609
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:45,838
it's not pulling up calcium um fast

1610
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:48,960
enough to allow for that is is how Nadia

1611
01:05:45,838 --> 01:05:50,000
Dr. Greenhouse explained it to me. Um,

1612
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:52,798
and I thought that was really

1613
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:54,318
interesting. And I do see plants, um,

1614
01:05:52,798 --> 01:05:55,679
and people, you know, people could do

1615
01:05:54,318 --> 01:05:58,239
this experiment, but essentially if you

1616
01:05:55,679 --> 01:06:01,239
put a plant near a fan, um, it's going

1617
01:05:58,239 --> 01:06:04,000
to dramatically impact the level, the

1618
01:06:01,239 --> 01:06:05,199
water needs and the amount of evapot

1619
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,960
transanspiration that's occurring in

1620
01:06:05,199 --> 01:06:08,879
that plant versus a plant that's further

1621
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:11,199
away from a fan that's not getting the

1622
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:14,079
same air flow. Yeah. So air flow will

1623
01:06:11,199 --> 01:06:16,558
will increase that. So there's radiation

1624
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:18,400
energy and convection energy. And so if

1625
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:20,079
you increase air flow, you're increasing

1626
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:21,599
the convection energy to the leaf, which

1627
01:06:20,079 --> 01:06:23,359
will increase the evaporation rate.

1628
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:26,000
Absolutely. The problem with what you're

1629
01:06:23,358 --> 01:06:28,960
seeing is the leaf probably can't keep

1630
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:30,559
up with the rate of evaporation. So it

1631
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:32,079
closes its stomata because when it

1632
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:32,839
experiences water stress, it'll close

1633
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:36,400
its

1634
01:06:32,838 --> 01:06:38,400
stomata and the then the only way for it

1635
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:39,920
to to maintain energy balance is to

1636
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:43,358
radiate heat. So the leaf temperature

1637
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:46,318
will go up and you can start to see uh

1638
01:06:43,358 --> 01:06:48,480
you know burning issues essentially. And

1639
01:06:46,318 --> 01:06:51,920
so the issue there to me with is with

1640
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:54,920
excessive um air flow is the stomata are

1641
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:54,920
closing.

1642
01:06:56,318 --> 01:07:01,960
H you know here it's really interesting.

1643
01:06:59,519 --> 01:07:06,318
So the way I've

1644
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:09,519
always Oh gonna say like when I see

1645
01:07:06,318 --> 01:07:13,920
issues on plants the first thing I look

1646
01:07:09,519 --> 01:07:16,000
at too is is watering and VPD because

1647
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:17,760
those are which is another way of

1648
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,798
approaching this transpiration thing

1649
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:20,039
that you're talking about is this idea

1650
01:07:18,798 --> 01:07:23,038
that is there

1651
01:07:20,039 --> 01:07:25,480
sufficient water in the media in the

1652
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:29,440
soil for plant roots to take up and

1653
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:32,798
transpire and then you know what what is

1654
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:35,798
the humidity in the room that allows for

1655
01:07:32,798 --> 01:07:39,559
these sorts of transpiration to occur.

1656
01:07:35,798 --> 01:07:44,400
the mo so relative humidity

1657
01:07:39,559 --> 01:07:46,559
um matters a lot in terms of the opening

1658
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:48,559
and the closing of the stomata but what

1659
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:51,839
I always I always thought and this was a

1660
01:07:48,559 --> 01:07:53,160
misconception that low relative humidity

1661
01:07:51,838 --> 01:07:55,440
would increase

1662
01:07:53,159 --> 01:07:57,118
transpiration so if you dry out the air

1663
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:58,798
it'll increase transpiration in other

1664
01:07:57,119 --> 01:08:02,000
words if you increase the VPD

1665
01:07:58,798 --> 01:08:03,920
transpiration will go up

1666
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,440
like the plant would like the plant's

1667
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:06,639
trying to compensate So it transpires

1668
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:08,559
more. I mean, this is what you people

1669
01:08:06,639 --> 01:08:11,920
say. If you increase BPD, you increase

1670
01:08:08,559 --> 01:08:13,519
transpiration. But I but for what I I

1671
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:17,039
wouldn't see that in the tissue data

1672
01:08:13,519 --> 01:08:18,560
with calcium. And it turns out that this

1673
01:08:17,039 --> 01:08:20,479
isn't necessarily true. In fact, in

1674
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:23,279
certain instances, a high relative

1675
01:08:20,479 --> 01:08:25,039
humidity creates more evaporation

1676
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:27,520
because a high relative humidity can

1677
01:08:25,039 --> 01:08:30,479
open the stomata, allowing the plant to

1678
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:34,359
actually evaporate water out. So it's

1679
01:08:30,479 --> 01:08:36,959
not a humidity matters but it matters

1680
01:08:34,359 --> 01:08:38,838
because in part because it's opening and

1681
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:42,158
closing the stomata which allows for

1682
01:08:38,838 --> 01:08:43,519
evaporation. Um so when someone says VPD

1683
01:08:42,158 --> 01:08:45,039
growers usually think of temperature and

1684
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:46,600
relative humidity on you know on the

1685
01:08:45,039 --> 01:08:49,719
chart

1686
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:54,319
and it's not necessarily the right

1687
01:08:49,719 --> 01:08:55,920
metric to determine stomodel opening. Um

1688
01:08:54,319 --> 01:08:58,319
you know again temperature and relative

1689
01:08:55,920 --> 01:09:00,239
humidity matter but the the the air

1690
01:08:58,319 --> 01:09:03,319
vapor pressure deficit in itself

1691
01:09:00,238 --> 01:09:06,399
doesn't. So if you know

1692
01:09:03,319 --> 01:09:08,640
growers that what what really matters is

1693
01:09:06,399 --> 01:09:10,879
leaf temperature and so I think a lot of

1694
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:13,039
people um have heard that they should

1695
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:16,400
use a leaf temperature adjustment and

1696
01:09:13,039 --> 01:09:18,238
that's that is the key to keeping

1697
01:09:16,399 --> 01:09:20,399
stomata open and closed and anyone who's

1698
01:09:18,238 --> 01:09:23,678
transitioned from an HPS to an LED light

1699
01:09:20,399 --> 01:09:25,519
knows that. um you get wildly different

1700
01:09:23,679 --> 01:09:27,119
results if you keep the VPD the same and

1701
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:29,359
it's because there's a change in leaf

1702
01:09:27,119 --> 01:09:30,960
temperature. So the key here to really

1703
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:32,560
understand evaporation rate to really

1704
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:34,880
understand if the stomata are open and

1705
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:36,798
closed is to is to understand leaf

1706
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:41,079
temperature and to use leaf temperature

1707
01:09:36,798 --> 01:09:41,079
to do the BPD calculation.

1708
01:09:43,838 --> 01:09:47,198
That's really interesting. Yeah, it's

1709
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:51,198
it's kind of been difficult for me to to

1710
01:09:47,198 --> 01:09:53,198
to learn because I'm having to relearn

1711
01:09:51,198 --> 01:09:56,158
and it's it's like there's these certain

1712
01:09:53,198 --> 01:10:00,479
principles that I've always held as this

1713
01:09:56,158 --> 01:10:02,879
is how it works and um it's taken me a

1714
01:10:00,479 --> 01:10:07,158
long time to to try to understand these

1715
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:09,039
new concepts um around

1716
01:10:07,158 --> 01:10:10,960
evaporation because it doesn't really

1717
01:10:09,039 --> 01:10:13,198
work with my existing sort of my

1718
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:15,880
previous learning around how it worked.

1719
01:10:13,198 --> 01:10:17,839
Um, but now that I'm sort of

1720
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:20,000
understanding the the opening and

1721
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:23,440
closing of stomata and evaporation rate,

1722
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:25,119
it's it's helping me immensely in in

1723
01:10:23,439 --> 01:10:28,158
sort of understanding how these

1724
01:10:25,119 --> 01:10:32,039
high-tech green houses are are managing

1725
01:10:28,158 --> 01:10:32,039
their environmental conditions.

1726
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:37,400
Yeah, I'm gonna have to reach out to

1727
01:10:35,679 --> 01:10:39,840
Nadia for

1728
01:10:37,399 --> 01:10:41,279
a, you know, more of an explanation or

1729
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:42,400
more discussion around this topic

1730
01:10:41,279 --> 01:10:44,880
because I think it's really interesting

1731
01:10:42,399 --> 01:10:46,158
and I I don't want to say that I fully

1732
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:47,840
understand everything you're saying here

1733
01:10:46,158 --> 01:10:50,000
in regards to it. I'm still processing

1734
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:52,480
it. But I think that's uh I think that's

1735
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:53,560
interesting and that's what I love about

1736
01:10:52,479 --> 01:10:56,718
plants

1737
01:10:53,560 --> 01:11:00,239
and you know aronomy and all of this is

1738
01:10:56,719 --> 01:11:02,880
I feel like I never stop learning or

1739
01:11:00,238 --> 01:11:04,718
being challenged by by new concepts or

1740
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:07,079
new ways of thinking around things.

1741
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:11,679
Yeah. Yeah, definitely. I mean there's a

1742
01:11:07,079 --> 01:11:14,279
it's it sort of a whole world of plants

1743
01:11:11,679 --> 01:11:17,520
are like these incredibly

1744
01:11:14,279 --> 01:11:19,920
complex systems. And so and what I think

1745
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:22,960
the hardest part for me in understanding

1746
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:24,840
is when you change one variable you

1747
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:27,840
multiple other variables change

1748
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:31,800
simultaneously. So um that's sort of

1749
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:31,800
what makes it complex.

1750
01:11:35,439 --> 01:11:40,158
Yeah. So on the topic of tissue testing

1751
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:42,440
just to stay on that topic you mentioned

1752
01:11:40,158 --> 01:11:44,719
some stuff around

1753
01:11:42,439 --> 01:11:48,399
um sampling. Yeah. you know, tissue

1754
01:11:44,719 --> 01:11:50,319
testing. Further, there's a few things I

1755
01:11:48,399 --> 01:11:52,719
just want to communicate to growers who

1756
01:11:50,319 --> 01:11:55,279
are already tissue testing or or

1757
01:11:52,719 --> 01:11:58,319
thinking about it, which is

1758
01:11:55,279 --> 01:12:01,439
the the need to test. There's a couple

1759
01:11:58,319 --> 01:12:04,920
things you it's important to test at the

1760
01:12:01,439 --> 01:12:08,158
right time in a cycle.

1761
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:10,079
Um there's because as you know, Tad,

1762
01:12:08,158 --> 01:12:13,920
that the plant will transllocate

1763
01:12:10,079 --> 01:12:15,679
nutrients late in the cycle. So,

1764
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:17,119
Usually there's, you know, after sort of

1765
01:12:15,679 --> 01:12:19,760
the plant stops stretching, the flowers

1766
01:12:17,119 --> 01:12:22,238
are stacking, the the majority of the

1767
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:24,400
assimilates are going toward the flowers

1768
01:12:22,238 --> 01:12:26,158
and there's less leaf growth. And so

1769
01:12:24,399 --> 01:12:27,759
certain immobile nutrients are going to

1770
01:12:26,158 --> 01:12:30,319
accumulate more and more and more in the

1771
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:31,679
large fan leaves. Um, and other

1772
01:12:30,319 --> 01:12:33,679
nutrients that are mobile are going to

1773
01:12:31,679 --> 01:12:35,440
be moved out of the fan leaves and moved

1774
01:12:33,679 --> 01:12:39,760
into the flowers where they're needed.

1775
01:12:35,439 --> 01:12:42,079
So after about week two of flower and

1776
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:44,320
more so after week four, but I like week

1777
01:12:42,079 --> 01:12:47,399
two as the target time to tissue test,

1778
01:12:44,319 --> 01:12:50,238
but after week two, three, four, the the

1779
01:12:47,399 --> 01:12:52,000
nutrients get really odd on a tissue

1780
01:12:50,238 --> 01:12:54,238
test, and there's not an easy way to

1781
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:57,359
analyze the results of the tissue test.

1782
01:12:54,238 --> 01:12:59,519
So, I I'm I've received so many tissue

1783
01:12:57,359 --> 01:13:01,599
tests on cannabis from like plants at

1784
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:03,840
harvest and it's just I I can't even

1785
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:06,239
make a recommendation on it because the

1786
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:08,000
calcium levels are skyhigh and the

1787
01:13:06,238 --> 01:13:10,238
nitrogen is low and there's not really a

1788
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:11,520
target level that we're looking at. So,

1789
01:13:10,238 --> 01:13:15,919
I think it's really important for

1790
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:18,560
growers to to um tissue test before week

1791
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:21,719
two of flower. you can tissue test and

1792
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:24,400
veg um really anytime before

1793
01:13:21,719 --> 01:13:25,920
then you know week one week two you

1794
01:13:24,399 --> 01:13:28,879
could go to week three probably but

1795
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:32,000
after that it's it's really unhelpful

1796
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:34,159
data um so that's the first thing the

1797
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,600
other thing is the size of the leaf

1798
01:13:34,158 --> 01:13:37,439
really matters because like I said

1799
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:39,520
calcium will accumulate in the larger

1800
01:13:37,439 --> 01:13:42,719
leaves the older leaves I should say so

1801
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:44,400
if you're taking fan leaves um three or

1802
01:13:42,719 --> 01:13:46,399
four notes down you're going to get a

1803
01:13:44,399 --> 01:13:49,679
much different number than if you're

1804
01:13:46,399 --> 01:13:53,198
taking the new small leaves at the top

1805
01:13:49,679 --> 01:13:55,520
of the plant. And so you can think you

1806
01:13:53,198 --> 01:13:58,479
have low calcium because the leaves that

1807
01:13:55,520 --> 01:14:00,159
you're pulling are too small, too young.

1808
01:13:58,479 --> 01:14:01,678
So it's it's really important to stay

1809
01:14:00,158 --> 01:14:03,639
consistent and to make sure that the

1810
01:14:01,679 --> 01:14:06,359
leaves that you're pulling are are fully

1811
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:10,159
expanded large leaves.

1812
01:14:06,359 --> 01:14:12,639
Um, I like a couple nodes down just the

1813
01:14:10,158 --> 01:14:15,839
the first leaf on a branch that you

1814
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:17,679
think is, you know, mature. And then

1815
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:20,079
whatever you choose, you stay consistent

1816
01:14:17,679 --> 01:14:21,679
with that sampling protocol. And those

1817
01:14:20,079 --> 01:14:23,920
are the two big mistakes that people

1818
01:14:21,679 --> 01:14:26,000
make. And I I always feel bad because,

1819
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:28,239
you know, this is a lot of time and

1820
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:31,039
money that people are spending sampling.

1821
01:14:28,238 --> 01:14:34,279
So, week two of flower, fully expanded,

1822
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:34,279
new growth.

1823
01:14:37,119 --> 01:14:42,719
So, I I I think those are good points. I

1824
01:14:40,479 --> 01:14:45,238
like the idea of tissue testing for the

1825
01:14:42,719 --> 01:14:49,279
data that it gives us. I think it's

1826
01:14:45,238 --> 01:14:53,119
expensive relative to soil testing for

1827
01:14:49,279 --> 01:14:55,840
managing fertility. And I've actually

1828
01:14:53,119 --> 01:14:59,519
used tissue testing a little differently

1829
01:14:55,840 --> 01:15:01,199
in the sense that later in flower. So,

1830
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:05,600
so if you want to use tissue testing as

1831
01:15:01,198 --> 01:15:08,000
a as a agonomic tool for dis, you know,

1832
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:09,920
data driven decisions, then I think week

1833
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:12,319
two makes a lot of sense. But where I've

1834
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:14,480
used it is I have a plant, let's say

1835
01:15:12,319 --> 01:15:16,439
week five, week six, and something's

1836
01:15:14,479 --> 01:15:19,439
going on and I can't figure out what it

1837
01:15:16,439 --> 01:15:22,158
is. U I'll do a tissue test and then

1838
01:15:19,439 --> 01:15:23,599
that'll tell me, oh, this reflects, you

1839
01:15:22,158 --> 01:15:25,439
know, what I thought I was seeing

1840
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:27,920
visually and then I have a better idea

1841
01:15:25,439 --> 01:15:30,000
of what a visual symptom for that

1842
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:32,880
nutrient is. and then I make sure to

1843
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:34,719
address it on the next round. I'm not I

1844
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:37,400
can't I don't feel I can use that tissue

1845
01:15:34,719 --> 01:15:41,279
test to

1846
01:15:37,399 --> 01:15:44,158
make definitive decisions about my

1847
01:15:41,279 --> 01:15:45,920
fertility applications the next cycle.

1848
01:15:44,158 --> 01:15:47,439
But it it's like a one more piece of

1849
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:49,359
information that supports what I'm

1850
01:15:47,439 --> 01:15:51,759
seeing. And so just to clarify, are you

1851
01:15:49,359 --> 01:15:53,839
sap testing or are you tissue testing? I

1852
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:53,840
don't

1853
01:15:54,920 --> 01:16:00,158
know. Tissue. I haven't gotten into SAP

1854
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:02,079
testing for a few reasons. I think it's

1855
01:16:00,158 --> 01:16:05,359
really interesting, but my concerns

1856
01:16:02,079 --> 01:16:07,840
around it are the cost, the fact that

1857
01:16:05,359 --> 01:16:09,279
the databases are not really publicly

1858
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:11,520
available. They're all sort of internal

1859
01:16:09,279 --> 01:16:13,279
to these labs, which I struggle with as

1860
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:15,080
a you know, wanting more transparency

1861
01:16:13,279 --> 01:16:17,359
there. And then

1862
01:16:15,079 --> 01:16:19,519
um yeah, the fact that it's a number

1863
01:16:17,359 --> 01:16:21,119
that's going to be changing so much um I

1864
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:24,320
would just need to be really I feel like

1865
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:25,840
dialed in with consistency on testing.

1866
01:16:24,319 --> 01:16:27,840
That being said, I do think it's really

1867
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:30,000
interesting and I think it has value. I

1868
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:31,440
just I haven't personally gotten to

1869
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:33,520
where that's one of the tools that I'm

1870
01:16:31,439 --> 01:16:36,000
Yeah, similar. I I What are your

1871
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:37,760
thoughts?

1872
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:40,399
I like I like to just say start with

1873
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:43,840
tissue testing. It's $40 a test compared

1874
01:16:40,399 --> 01:16:45,198
to, you know, um I think 75 to 100 for

1875
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:46,800
SAP testing. You also have to get the

1876
01:16:45,198 --> 01:16:49,198
sample to the lab sooner. It's got to be

1877
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:51,360
on ice so that the cost ends up being

1878
01:16:49,198 --> 01:16:53,759
more than double when you're sap

1879
01:16:51,359 --> 01:16:56,079
testing. It also in my experience

1880
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:57,760
doesn't help to see a single SAP test at

1881
01:16:56,079 --> 01:16:59,359
any random point in the cycle. It should

1882
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:00,880
be done like every two weeks. So then

1883
01:16:59,359 --> 01:17:03,000
you you're looking at a much larger

1884
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:05,920
expense. I also

1885
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:08,119
see I also totally agree with I struggle

1886
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:11,520
with the lack of

1887
01:17:08,119 --> 01:17:14,000
um yeah transparency. I mean new age has

1888
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:16,239
has has become my go-to lab, but I've

1889
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:17,760
been working with SAP testing before

1890
01:17:16,238 --> 01:17:19,599
they were around and I've just continued

1891
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:21,280
to have issues. Also, you're getting

1892
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:22,800
recommendations from the lab, and I tend

1893
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:24,158
to disagree with a lot of these lab

1894
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:25,520
recommendations, especially around high

1895
01:17:24,158 --> 01:17:27,599
chloride. So, yeah, I have a bunch of

1896
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:29,440
small issues with sap testing, but at

1897
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:31,039
the end of the day, I just think the

1898
01:17:29,439 --> 01:17:33,359
lowhanging fruit if you want to test

1899
01:17:31,039 --> 01:17:35,039
your tissue is to get a $40 tissue test

1900
01:17:33,359 --> 01:17:37,880
at week two of flower. Just start with

1901
01:17:35,039 --> 01:17:42,399
one. There's research established target

1902
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:44,480
levels, multiple different um researched

1903
01:17:42,399 --> 01:17:46,079
levels that are all pretty similar. And

1904
01:17:44,479 --> 01:17:48,879
so, that's just like an easy

1905
01:17:46,079 --> 01:17:54,158
interpretation. It's 40 bucks. Y you do

1906
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:57,440
it once. Stop testing I I do use in um

1907
01:17:54,158 --> 01:18:01,759
in large production systems where let's

1908
01:17:57,439 --> 01:18:04,399
say a a 3% increase in yield makes a

1909
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:06,560
huge difference economically. Um yeah,

1910
01:18:04,399 --> 01:18:09,679
layering in SAP testing on top of tissue

1911
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:11,440
testing makes sense. Um but it but

1912
01:18:09,679 --> 01:18:13,199
honestly how I've used it is to do

1913
01:18:11,439 --> 01:18:15,198
tissue testing, do sap testing, and they

1914
01:18:13,198 --> 01:18:17,678
the idea is you're just trying to to

1915
01:18:15,198 --> 01:18:20,238
validate one you're trying to validate

1916
01:18:17,679 --> 01:18:22,800
the test to really pinpoint to be extra

1917
01:18:20,238 --> 01:18:26,000
super confident when you're targeting

1918
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:28,400
nutrients just because it just gives you

1919
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:31,359
more confidence uh in that that

1920
01:18:28,399 --> 01:18:33,439
application is going to um be the right

1921
01:18:31,359 --> 01:18:36,079
one. So, for example, I use it in

1922
01:18:33,439 --> 01:18:39,599
orchard crops a lot because we're

1923
01:18:36,079 --> 01:18:40,880
talking about just huge swaths, huge

1924
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:42,719
applications. You know, if you're going

1925
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:44,719
to if you apply, let's say you apply

1926
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:46,560
potassium, that could be, you know, a

1927
01:18:44,719 --> 01:18:48,158
$10,000 application. So, you just want

1928
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:51,280
to have as much data as possible to back

1929
01:18:48,158 --> 01:18:54,439
it up. Um, but yeah, I mean, I would be

1930
01:18:51,279 --> 01:18:56,399
concerned about tissue testing that late

1931
01:18:54,439 --> 01:18:58,399
because I don't really know what the

1932
01:18:56,399 --> 01:18:59,679
numbers are supposed to say. Um, you're

1933
01:18:58,399 --> 01:19:03,559
always going to see deficient nitrogen

1934
01:18:59,679 --> 01:19:03,560
at week eight, for example.

1935
01:19:07,119 --> 01:19:10,559
Yeah, I don't I don't use it so much for

1936
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:12,400
nitrogen that late, but but more just to

1937
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:15,280
see if there's a trace mineral issue or

1938
01:19:12,399 --> 01:19:17,198
if what I'm seeing visually matches with

1939
01:19:15,279 --> 01:19:19,920
like what deficiency I think it is is

1940
01:19:17,198 --> 01:19:22,799
reflected on that test. And again, it's

1941
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:26,480
I don't use it very often as a tool. I

1942
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:28,480
I'm more focused on soil testing at this

1943
01:19:26,479 --> 01:19:29,759
point in time, but I I absolutely

1944
01:19:28,479 --> 01:19:31,759
understand and especially in things like

1945
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:34,800
hydro, I think it makes a lot a lot of

1946
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:36,719
sense. Um, and I will just say as a

1947
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:39,600
shout out to New Age and Scott. I've met

1948
01:19:36,719 --> 01:19:42,079
him a couple years now at uh the soil

1949
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:44,480
summit and he's a great guy. I always

1950
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:46,399
enjoy hearing his talks. Um, I think

1951
01:19:44,479 --> 01:19:49,279
it's really interesting. It's just not a

1952
01:19:46,399 --> 01:19:53,198
technology that I've really um yeah, I

1953
01:19:49,279 --> 01:19:55,279
mean I I have sent SAP samples to the

1954
01:19:53,198 --> 01:19:58,319
Netherlands for years. I've sent them to

1955
01:19:55,279 --> 01:20:00,158
to New Age. Um, and actually I did some

1956
01:19:58,319 --> 01:20:02,479
split tests last year for people who who

1957
01:20:00,158 --> 01:20:06,799
do want a SAP test. And actually the

1958
01:20:02,479 --> 01:20:08,639
results in in stone fruit um between New

1959
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:12,039
Age and Nova Crop Control in the

1960
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:15,119
Netherlands were were very similar. So

1961
01:20:12,039 --> 01:20:16,719
um no need to send them across the ocean

1962
01:20:15,119 --> 01:20:19,359
if you're going to sap test. I think New

1963
01:20:16,719 --> 01:20:19,359
Age is the way to

1964
01:20:22,039 --> 01:20:27,920
go. Great. Well, we're running out of

1965
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:30,640
time, but I I wanted to talk to you just

1966
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:33,920
briefly or not so briefly. We'll see how

1967
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:35,520
it goes about um sort of your new

1968
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:38,000
philosophies that you've been exploring

1969
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:41,120
around cultivation. Now, for those that

1970
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:43,359
aren't familiar, you have a course um

1971
01:20:41,119 --> 01:20:45,679
through your sole doctor website that

1972
01:20:43,359 --> 01:20:47,439
you've had for years now. I've audited

1973
01:20:45,679 --> 01:20:49,359
the course. It's it's wonderful. For

1974
01:20:47,439 --> 01:20:51,238
people who want a deep dive in soil

1975
01:20:49,359 --> 01:20:54,319
testing and want the ability to really

1976
01:20:51,238 --> 01:20:55,559
understand those results and read their

1977
01:20:54,319 --> 01:20:57,519
own tests and make their own

1978
01:20:55,560 --> 01:21:00,960
recommendation, this is the best

1979
01:20:57,520 --> 01:21:02,480
publicly available tool uh for folks. Um

1980
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:05,679
you can check it out on the soul doctor

1981
01:21:02,479 --> 01:21:07,039
website. But um yeah, working on

1982
01:21:05,679 --> 01:21:09,279
something new. So I've spent almost

1983
01:21:07,039 --> 01:21:12,800
eight months the last eight months

1984
01:21:09,279 --> 01:21:14,800
deeply studying greenhouse optimization.

1985
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:17,199
So I've been learning the principles

1986
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:20,239
used in some of the world's largest

1987
01:21:17,198 --> 01:21:22,719
most high-tech green houses, the Dutch

1988
01:21:20,238 --> 01:21:25,759
glass houses, where they're just

1989
01:21:22,719 --> 01:21:27,439
achieving unbelievable yields and plant

1990
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:29,520
health, like sweet pepper plants that

1991
01:21:27,439 --> 01:21:32,039
are 10 feet tall, just loaded with

1992
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:35,159
peppers, and just really

1993
01:21:32,039 --> 01:21:36,679
um amazing results.

1994
01:21:35,158 --> 01:21:39,198
And

1995
01:21:36,679 --> 01:21:41,520
uh so with all this, I'm sort of

1996
01:21:39,198 --> 01:21:43,279
creating this this program that will

1997
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:46,880
teach professional growers principles of

1998
01:21:43,279 --> 01:21:50,158
what creates general plant balance uh in

1999
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:53,279
a greenhouse or indoor growroom. Um and

2000
01:21:50,158 --> 01:21:55,519
the techniques and tools to achieve, you

2001
01:21:53,279 --> 01:21:57,439
know, this kind of performance depending

2002
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:59,760
on what level of technology people have.

2003
01:21:57,439 --> 01:22:01,439
So this involves the use of various

2004
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:03,960
different technology as well as sensors

2005
01:22:01,439 --> 01:22:06,960
and automation to improve facilities.

2006
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:08,399
Um, and so I'm developing it for

2007
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:11,600
commercial growers who have some degree

2008
01:22:08,399 --> 01:22:13,198
of control of their environment. So

2009
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:14,800
unfortunately outdoor production, you

2010
01:22:13,198 --> 01:22:17,198
don't necessarily have much control over

2011
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:18,880
the different conditions. Um, but I'm

2012
01:22:17,198 --> 01:22:21,279
trying to take these principles that are

2013
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:24,800
used in the highest tech autonomous

2014
01:22:21,279 --> 01:22:28,238
green houses and apply them all the way

2015
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:30,639
down to like low tech high tunnels. Um,

2016
01:22:28,238 --> 01:22:33,039
so from sort of CA all the way to low

2017
01:22:30,639 --> 01:22:37,159
tunnel or low tech high tunnels and

2018
01:22:33,039 --> 01:22:39,600
green houses. Um, and the content has

2019
01:22:37,158 --> 01:22:41,920
traditionally just been for these really

2020
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:43,600
advanced green houses, but I don't see

2021
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:46,480
why some of these principles can't be

2022
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:48,560
applied at to every level of grower. And

2023
01:22:46,479 --> 01:22:50,399
so I'm trying to that's kind of my

2024
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:52,480
inspiration behind it. It's kind of a

2025
01:22:50,399 --> 01:22:54,399
Robin Hood scheme to to take this

2026
01:22:52,479 --> 01:22:56,559
amazing information from these big

2027
01:22:54,399 --> 01:22:59,519
companies and universities and change it

2028
01:22:56,560 --> 01:23:02,560
a bit and apply it to multiple different

2029
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:04,000
contexts and and present it as

2030
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:05,840
succinctly as possible. So that's what

2031
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:07,679
I've been working on doing. It's been

2032
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:09,920
it's taken a long time. It's a lot of

2033
01:23:07,679 --> 01:23:12,239
learning for me. It's also just a lot of

2034
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:16,399
content and research to go through. Um

2035
01:23:12,238 --> 01:23:18,479
but most of this is content from um

2036
01:23:16,399 --> 01:23:20,960
Bahaning University in the Netherlands.

2037
01:23:18,479 --> 01:23:22,879
there's some professors there that have

2038
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:25,039
really innovated how to think about

2039
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:26,159
greenhouse production. Um, so that's

2040
01:23:25,039 --> 01:23:28,880
what I've been working on. I mean, it

2041
01:23:26,158 --> 01:23:32,559
goes through like a lot of the the the

2042
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:34,480
scientific balance of plants. Um, and

2043
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:37,039
then it goes into sort of the the goal

2044
01:23:34,479 --> 01:23:38,959
of the grower and different checklists

2045
01:23:37,039 --> 01:23:41,119
uh and how to measure things, what to

2046
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:43,279
measure, different tools for creating

2047
01:23:41,119 --> 01:23:45,039
balance. So if you're in a greenhouse,

2048
01:23:43,279 --> 01:23:46,800
um what kind of materials to be using in

2049
01:23:45,039 --> 01:23:49,359
your greenhouse, diffusion plastics,

2050
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:50,560
high pressure fogging, AC, and then I go

2051
01:23:49,359 --> 01:23:51,920
through most of the course is actually

2052
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:54,800
going through scenarios. So I'm trying

2053
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:58,960
to connect the principles to a ton of

2054
01:23:54,800 --> 01:24:00,960
real world grower situations. Um so can

2055
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:02,800
you give me some examples of these

2056
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:04,239
principles that you mentioned that are

2057
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:06,239
in the course just so we can have a

2058
01:24:04,238 --> 01:24:09,678
better idea can flesh out what you're

2059
01:24:06,238 --> 01:24:12,439
what you're describing? Sure. Um so one

2060
01:24:09,679 --> 01:24:17,039
of the scenarios that I discuss

2061
01:24:12,439 --> 01:24:20,119
is is around disease and how to reduce

2062
01:24:17,039 --> 01:24:23,600
the susceptibility of disease.

2063
01:24:20,119 --> 01:24:25,519
Um and so traditionally, you know, we're

2064
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:27,480
thinking a lot about humidity and air

2065
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:31,600
flow and air movement.

2066
01:24:27,479 --> 01:24:34,479
Um, I really talk a lot in this program

2067
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:36,719
about how to prevent free water on the

2068
01:24:34,479 --> 01:24:39,198
leaves, which is often one of the root

2069
01:24:36,719 --> 01:24:41,679
causes of disease, either plant cell

2070
01:24:39,198 --> 01:24:44,000
damage or condensation. So, while

2071
01:24:41,679 --> 01:24:45,840
relative humidity does increase risk of

2072
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:48,158
condensation, condensation can also

2073
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:51,840
happen at relatively low humidity

2074
01:24:48,158 --> 01:24:54,079
levels. Um and the final thing that can

2075
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:56,920
cause disease is a weak plant which is

2076
01:24:54,079 --> 01:24:59,679
almost always from an assimilate or a

2077
01:24:56,920 --> 01:25:02,639
photosynthesate imbalance in the plant.

2078
01:24:59,679 --> 01:25:04,639
So soilborn diseases but also above

2079
01:25:02,639 --> 01:25:06,239
ground diseases always happen when the

2080
01:25:04,639 --> 01:25:07,679
plant's natural immune system isn't

2081
01:25:06,238 --> 01:25:10,319
powerful enough to fight back which is

2082
01:25:07,679 --> 01:25:14,000
often due to an assimilate imbalance um

2083
01:25:10,319 --> 01:25:15,719
or an assimilate deficit really. So a

2084
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:18,238
steady production and consumption of

2085
01:25:15,719 --> 01:25:22,800
assimilates leads to steady root growth

2086
01:25:18,238 --> 01:25:25,959
and and steady um root exodation. And

2087
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:28,960
this is what feeds a healthy microbial

2088
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:30,319
population. So if your microbes lose

2089
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:32,319
their primary food source, they won't be

2090
01:25:30,319 --> 01:25:33,759
able to defend the roots nearly as well.

2091
01:25:32,319 --> 01:25:35,519
So that's sort of where I'm kind of

2092
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:37,360
coming from from an assimilate balance

2093
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:39,760
standpoint. Um, and there's a number of

2094
01:25:37,359 --> 01:25:41,599
different techniques that you can use to

2095
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:42,800
balance assimilate consumption and

2096
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:45,760
production in the plant. Production

2097
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:48,560
being photosynthesis. And one is looking

2098
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:51,679
at your average daily temperature

2099
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:53,400
compared to the DLI. That is like a

2100
01:25:51,679 --> 01:25:57,279
really really powerful steering

2101
01:25:53,399 --> 01:25:59,679
technique. Um, and just it's a it's a

2102
01:25:57,279 --> 01:26:01,840
really great way to keep the production

2103
01:25:59,679 --> 01:26:05,440
and consumption of a similant stable on

2104
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:07,440
a 24-hour basis. So that's an example.

2105
01:26:05,439 --> 01:26:08,759
Um, and then going back to disease, I

2106
01:26:07,439 --> 01:26:11,198
talk a lot about how to prevent

2107
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:12,800
condensation. Um, and depending on the

2108
01:26:11,198 --> 01:26:13,919
facility, for example, in green houses,

2109
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:15,600
I mentioned you get a lot of heat

2110
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:18,079
emission at night. So, I talk about ways

2111
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:20,639
to to make sure your plant temperature

2112
01:26:18,079 --> 01:26:26,238
doesn't reach due point using climate

2113
01:26:20,639 --> 01:26:28,480
screens um and other other means uh

2114
01:26:26,238 --> 01:26:31,919
increasing air movement. How to increase

2115
01:26:28,479 --> 01:26:34,559
air movement. So, um I I've mentioned

2116
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:37,119
this too. love your convection tubing in

2117
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:39,520
the canopy. Um I'm also doing a lot of

2118
01:26:37,119 --> 01:26:43,359
experiments with vertical air fans, so

2119
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:45,840
like Vflow fans. Um and trying to create

2120
01:26:43,359 --> 01:26:47,759
air flow into the canopy. And then

2121
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:50,079
finally, temperature swings. And that

2122
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:52,480
can happen through, you know, all kinds

2123
01:26:50,079 --> 01:26:54,399
of different things. So, I've talked a

2124
01:26:52,479 --> 01:26:58,079
lot about ventilation optimization and

2125
01:26:54,399 --> 01:27:00,479
how to sort of manage your your vents

2126
01:26:58,079 --> 01:27:03,679
and how to ventilate your greenhouse to

2127
01:27:00,479 --> 01:27:05,119
avoid temperature swings. Um, and like I

2128
01:27:03,679 --> 01:27:08,199
said, condensation can happen at

2129
01:27:05,119 --> 01:27:12,079
relatively low relative humidity.

2130
01:27:08,198 --> 01:27:15,119
So, I talk about how to how to determine

2131
01:27:12,079 --> 01:27:17,238
your ventilation. For example, growers

2132
01:27:15,119 --> 01:27:19,599
should be using absolute

2133
01:27:17,238 --> 01:27:22,479
humidity, not necessarily relative

2134
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:25,679
humidity, to determine uh ventilation.

2135
01:27:22,479 --> 01:27:28,839
There's this really sort of wild example

2136
01:27:25,679 --> 01:27:32,440
that always confused me. You can have a

2137
01:27:28,840 --> 01:27:33,960
um let's say an outdoor temperature

2138
01:27:32,439 --> 01:27:37,519
of

2139
01:27:33,960 --> 01:27:42,198
like 68 degrees Fahrenheit, 20 Celsius,

2140
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:47,199
and 85 relative humidity. And

2141
01:27:42,198 --> 01:27:50,879
um if it's if it's warmer outside with a

2142
01:27:47,198 --> 01:27:53,119
lower relative humidity and you vent,

2143
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:56,159
you can actually

2144
01:27:53,119 --> 01:27:59,198
uh cool your your greenhouse because the

2145
01:27:56,158 --> 01:28:00,638
enthalpy or the energy outside is lower

2146
01:27:59,198 --> 01:28:02,000
than inside. So there's all these

2147
01:28:00,639 --> 01:28:05,199
fascinating examples of where

2148
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:07,039
ventilation um should be toggled with

2149
01:28:05,198 --> 01:28:09,039
absolute humidity instead. So things

2150
01:28:07,039 --> 01:28:11,039
like that, just tons of scenarios on how

2151
01:28:09,039 --> 01:28:13,439
to manage the environment inside a

2152
01:28:11,039 --> 01:28:14,960
greenhouse. You were able to I mean,

2153
01:28:13,439 --> 01:28:16,158
first of all, this is fascinating and I

2154
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:17,600
know it's a it's a little bit of a

2155
01:28:16,158 --> 01:28:20,000
different direction for you here, but

2156
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:22,320
I'm really excited for this um and to

2157
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:23,679
learn more about this course. Uh do you

2158
01:28:22,319 --> 01:28:27,279
know when it's do you have an

2159
01:28:23,679 --> 01:28:27,279
approximate date for release or is it

2160
01:28:27,319 --> 01:28:31,920
still you know I'm trying to finish

2161
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:34,079
something this year but uh I have you

2162
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:35,760
know I'm still working extensively with

2163
01:28:34,079 --> 01:28:37,198
growers on nutrient management. I have,

2164
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:38,400
you know, a large farm I'm managing,

2165
01:28:37,198 --> 01:28:41,599
especially in the spring. There's a lot

2166
01:28:38,399 --> 01:28:43,599
of work and I just have a lot more uh to

2167
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:46,400
dive into. So, it probably won't be done

2168
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:48,400
for several months, but late late 2025

2169
01:28:46,399 --> 01:28:50,399
is my goal. I I was going to say I so

2170
01:28:48,399 --> 01:28:52,079
wish you were able to make it to the

2171
01:28:50,399 --> 01:28:54,000
cannabis cultivation and science

2172
01:28:52,079 --> 01:28:56,158
conference in Bosezeman this year

2173
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:58,000
because uh Collective Elevation where

2174
01:28:56,158 --> 01:29:00,000
we're hosting it has all of these

2175
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:02,719
things. They have under a hamp air flow.

2176
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:04,719
They have uh they have the vertical

2177
01:29:02,719 --> 01:29:08,079
airflow uh fans and all of these

2178
01:29:04,719 --> 01:29:10,399
different things working. And I'm Adam,

2179
01:29:08,079 --> 01:29:13,039
the owner, is so excited to have Nadia,

2180
01:29:10,399 --> 01:29:14,638
Dr. greenhouse come out and walk as part

2181
01:29:13,039 --> 01:29:16,639
of the workshop, walk through the

2182
01:29:14,639 --> 01:29:19,359
facility and point out everything and

2183
01:29:16,639 --> 01:29:21,440
and talk about how they may be doing

2184
01:29:19,359 --> 01:29:24,559
things right or wrong or optimized

2185
01:29:21,439 --> 01:29:26,799
because airflow and humidity and VBD is

2186
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:29,600
such a complicated

2187
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:31,440
uh topic and it's so misunderstood and

2188
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:34,159
it's one thing that I I know it's one of

2189
01:29:31,439 --> 01:29:35,519
the things I'm least confident in myself

2190
01:29:34,158 --> 01:29:38,879
uh when it comes to cultivation

2191
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:39,920
practices. So, um, yeah, I really I know

2192
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:41,679
you were one of the first people I

2193
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:43,359
reached out to, and I know you're busy,

2194
01:29:41,679 --> 01:29:45,199
but I was really hoping, uh, you'd be

2195
01:29:43,359 --> 01:29:47,679
gonna make it. If things change, it's an

2196
01:29:45,198 --> 01:29:49,198
open invite, obviously. Yeah, I'm sorry.

2197
01:29:47,679 --> 01:29:50,880
If things change, I'll absolutely let

2198
01:29:49,198 --> 01:29:54,879
you know. I would love to see that that

2199
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:56,639
facility. Is it is it um fully indoor

2200
01:29:54,880 --> 01:30:01,119
with supplemental lighting or are they

2201
01:29:56,639 --> 01:30:02,880
NextG houses in Bosezeman, Montana with

2202
01:30:01,119 --> 01:30:05,279
they do have light depth capability, but

2203
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:07,920
you know, they're growing in what, like

2204
01:30:05,279 --> 01:30:09,599
20. I'm probably under exaggerating at

2205
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:10,719
negative 20 and then you know in the

2206
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:12,719
winter and then all the way in the

2207
01:30:10,719 --> 01:30:15,840
summer when it's you know it can be in

2208
01:30:12,719 --> 01:30:18,800
the 90s or higher. So they deal with all

2209
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:20,719
types of climates there and they're able

2210
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:22,480
to grow year round which is and grow

2211
01:30:20,719 --> 01:30:24,399
healthy plants. It's pretty awesome.

2212
01:30:22,479 --> 01:30:27,279
They're the largest living soil producer

2213
01:30:24,399 --> 01:30:30,158
in Montana. um they may be one of the

2214
01:30:27,279 --> 01:30:33,599
larger ones um greenhouse ones that I'm

2215
01:30:30,158 --> 01:30:35,359
aware of in the country and they're just

2216
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:39,199
phenomenally good people and good

2217
01:30:35,359 --> 01:30:39,198
growers and it's it's cool to

2218
01:30:39,399 --> 01:30:46,638
see you know I I am fascinated with

2219
01:30:44,399 --> 01:30:48,119
these mixed environments green houses

2220
01:30:46,639 --> 01:30:50,639
with supplemental

2221
01:30:48,119 --> 01:30:52,479
lights because there's so much more

2222
01:30:50,639 --> 01:30:54,800
potential but also they're they're

2223
01:30:52,479 --> 01:30:58,079
they're also much more difficult. you

2224
01:30:54,800 --> 01:31:00,960
really have to be good. Um because the

2225
01:30:58,079 --> 01:31:02,319
the the sun and the variability, you're

2226
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:04,560
still working with the variability of

2227
01:31:02,319 --> 01:31:06,559
nature. So, you're not just setting your

2228
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:09,920
the your lights, you're like having to

2229
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:12,719
to sort of adjust and move on the fly to

2230
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:14,399
varying radiation levels. Um and also

2231
01:31:12,719 --> 01:31:15,840
even cloud coverage. So, you know, for

2232
01:31:14,399 --> 01:31:18,399
example, at night, you're going to lose

2233
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:20,400
a lot more heat with an open sky versus

2234
01:31:18,399 --> 01:31:22,479
cloudy sky, and you have to adjust. So,

2235
01:31:20,399 --> 01:31:24,000
it's a very technical and fascinating

2236
01:31:22,479 --> 01:31:25,359
form of culture. I'm sure they'd love to

2237
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:28,719
have you out even if you can't make the

2238
01:31:25,359 --> 01:31:31,759
conference. So, uh, yeah. What What day

2239
01:31:28,719 --> 01:31:33,359
is the is the the greenhouse tour? The

2240
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:35,440
5th. September 5th, there's going to be

2241
01:31:33,359 --> 01:31:38,319
the tour as well as the workshop with

2242
01:31:35,439 --> 01:31:40,719
Nadia, uh, going concurrently at the

2243
01:31:38,319 --> 01:31:42,799
same time as a workshop with Suzanne

2244
01:31:40,719 --> 01:31:44,800
Wayright Evans, the bug lady. She's

2245
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:46,880
going to be doing a workshop, too. So,

2246
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:48,400
Okay, cool. Well, maybe I can try to do

2247
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:50,079
some kind of strike mission. I'm in the

2248
01:31:48,399 --> 01:31:54,000
it'll I'll be right in the middle of a

2249
01:31:50,079 --> 01:31:56,319
massive peach harvest that's like high

2250
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:57,840
intensity and high consequence. So

2251
01:31:56,319 --> 01:32:00,559

2252
01:31:57,840 --> 01:32:02,319
it. But I'll I'll keep it I'll keep it

2257
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:12,239
learn a ton when we get to talk and it's

2258
01:32:10,319 --> 01:32:14,319
always a lot of fun to have these

2259
01:32:12,238 --> 01:32:15,759
conversations and people ask actually

2260
01:32:14,319 --> 01:32:17,279
quite a bit like when am I going to have
