00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:29,599
edge of growing from a science-based

7
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,118
perspective and draw top experts from

8
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,119

products that we offer and manufacture

26
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,478
to make sure that they are science-based

27
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:13,519
and meet our standard of quality. My

28
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:15,840
guest this week is Saul Alba. Saul began

29
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:17,599
his agricultural work in vineyard and

30
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,759
winery operations on the central

31
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:21,919
California coast. After deciding to

32
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,680
focus career on crop protection, he

33
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,519
moved north where he managed IPM

34
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,240
programs at Monterey Mushroom Company

35
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:30,719
and Jacob's Farm. This work led to a

36
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:32,239
position as IPM manager at Harborside

37
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:34,679
Farms where he directed their

38
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:37,519
biointensive greenhouse cannabis IPM

39
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:41,118
program. Saul now works as a technical

40
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:43,280
sales representative for Biobea.

41
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:45,599
coming on the show today. Hey, Todd.

42
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,599
You're welcome.

43
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:49,359
Yeah, I'm I'm excited to have this

44
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:52,879
conversation with you. Um, you know, I

45
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:55,280
met you years ago now when you were uh

46
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:56,879
working at another insectory. Now you're

47
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,239
with BioBe, which I'm really excited

48
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:01,839
about because I get to work directly

49
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:03,759
with you and also with Kelly Vance as uh

50
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,200
our sort of our technical support guys.

51
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,639
Can you talk a little bit about what

52
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:12,959
your your current role is with BioBe?

53
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:16,719
Yeah. Um the title is uh let's see

54
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:19,360
technical sales representative. So I

55
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:22,400
work obviously getting reaching out to

56
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:25,680
get more customers but my job is really

57
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:28,400
consultative sales which is uh working

58
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:32,800
with the customers to help them design

59
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:36,879
IPM programs and um you know ultimately

60
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:39,519
the goal is um move their IPM to fewer

61
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:42,560
sprays or more compatible sprays, more

62
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:45,759
more compatible practices so that our

63
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,479
products can be integrated and um they

64
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:52,239
have success with them.

65
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:54,799
A and along with that too I would add uh

66
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:58,640
proper application rates of beneficial

67
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,959
insects and proper timing of application

68
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:02,399
rates with beneficial insects as as you

69
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:06,000
know then just to share with the

70
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:09,680
audience uh if we apply beneficial

71
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,959
insects earlier in the growth cycle um

72
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,760
you're going to have more success with

73
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:16,719
them and you can apply lower rates in as

74
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:18,318
a general rule. So um I know from

75
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:19,359
Suzanne we've had she's given me

76
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:21,199
instances where people have been

77
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,120
massively overapplying beneficial

78
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:25,199
insects which hurts your budget makes it

79
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,959
hard to stay in business. Uh and then on

80
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:30,560
the other hand um applying the wrong

81
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:35,519
insect or applying um levels inefficient

82
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:36,719
to actually control the target pest. So

83
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:41,120
yeah you have a really interesting

84
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:44,639
position. I'd like to add um that we at

85
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:48,000
BioBe with my team um I like to say

86
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:50,798
we're kind of we're a solutions first

87
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,239
approach. Okay, the sales important but

88
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,920
it'll it'll come. So, you know, you you

89
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,599
you

90
00:03:55,919 --> 00:04:01,199
uh show success of your products with a

91
00:03:58,598 --> 00:04:04,238
customer, they will buy in. Then they'll

92
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:06,719
also say hey you know they'll tell their

93
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:09,438
you know their friends that you know hey

94
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:13,199
try talk to this guy or go through biobe

95
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:15,359
right um and what do I mean by success

96
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:17,839
um with bio control that that's super

97
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:21,280
important to me that to define um

98
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:22,439
success not only means you know um our

99
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:25,359
products

100
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:27,680
helping increase your yields by keeping

101
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,360
pests under control keeping them at

102
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:34,800
under an economic threshold. It also

103
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:39,439
means keeping it within your budget.

104
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:41,600
Okay, that that to me is um is basically

105
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:45,439
goes handinhand with you know crop

106
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:50,000
protection within your budget. Okay, so

107
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:53,279
um I think sometimes other companies

108
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,560
uh they devise programs that are you

109
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:58,399
know shotgun type um programs. You know

110
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,918
throw all of this into your crop and you

111
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:02,159
won't see pests. Yeah, guess what?

112
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:05,279
That's probably true. If you throw every

113
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:08,479
biocrol or excessive biocrol

114
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:10,799
um or multiple

115
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:12,000
uh biocrol agents that are going after

116
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,319
the same pest when you may not

117
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,240
necessarily need that many. Um I think

118
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:21,439
that's a way to win, but you don't win

119
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,800
on the budget side, right? So that's

120
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:25,759
super important that we figure out how

121
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,439
to balance that.

122
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,479
Yeah. And one thing I want to touch on

123
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:32,240
is, you know, when I think of certain

124
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:34,079
target pests like two spotted

125
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,038
spidermite, my braid immediately goes to

126
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:39,519
pimileis or fungusnats, I think of, you

127
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:41,879
know, SF nematodes. But it's not as

128
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:44,959
simple as just

129
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:47,600
um combining, I guess, a beneficial and

130
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:49,680
a pest. Every, you know, one thing

131
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,160
Suzanne's really taught me is that every

132
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,879
facility, every grow space, every

133
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,240
greenhouse is different. Can you talk a

134
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:58,240
little bit about what those differences

135
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:01,840
are and how that goes into determining

136
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:04,800
what the best option is? Yeah, so you

137
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:06,719
know it it's the reason you're you and I

138
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,960
set this up is because you know that my

139
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,319
primary crop that I work with and the

140
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:12,799
crop I know the most about crop

141
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:17,199
protection is cannabis. Um and so I work

142
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:19,840
with um a greenhouse primarily um but

143
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:24,240
lots of indoor smaller indoor operations

144
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:27,038
and and um uh also outdoor you know um

145
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,360
fields. Um so that's what's cool about

146
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:31,839
that is you you get to understand like

147
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,919
what the pest complex is really like. Um

148
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:36,799
what I mean by that it's like what

149
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:38,959
really becomes an issue for different

150
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,439
growers in those different settings. And

151
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:44,399
so, for example, outdoors, grasshoppers

152
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:46,959
might be considered in certain regions

153
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:51,758
the most important pest to control,

154
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:54,680
whereas in a in a um indoor setting,

155
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:57,919
you'll never see grasshoppers. Um,

156
00:06:54,680 --> 00:07:00,800
but rude aphid can pop big in a

157
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:03,198
hydroponic indoor facility, whereas root

158
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,199
aid is not an issue outdoors. So, it

159
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:08,960
really does kind of depend on lots of

160
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:11,919
things. Um, climate being one. um you

161
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:15,439
know um and uh and and yeah, that's

162
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:18,159
that's going to be that's going to vary

163
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:20,719
um based on you know your your

164
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,840
particular operation. Some some really

165
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:28,720
really low tech green houses don't have

166
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:31,279
the option to um to like heat and use

167
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:34,639
use a dehumidifier. So their betritis

168
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:36,079
is, you know, harder to manage than, you

169
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,598
know, like a Dutch style greenhouse

170
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:39,439
where that's all designed into the

171
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:41,360
plant. So yeah, environment I think has

172
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:45,038
the the most to do with it. But that's

173
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:47,680
not all. Um practices, growing practices

174
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:49,639
also have a lot to do with it. So, um,

175
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:53,360
grow where

176
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:57,038
you tightly pack the the plants in the

177
00:07:53,360 --> 00:08:00,400
grow space, um, are going to usually be

178
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:03,038
more difficult to to manage pests

179
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:06,478
because a it's harder to find the pests

180
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:08,478
in a thicket and b sprays don't

181
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:10,719
penetrate well into, you know, if you

182
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:12,399
need to use sprays. So both of those

183
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,319
things, you know, it's a lot harder to

184
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:16,239
if you if you have plants tightly

185
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:20,160
tightly packed, it's a lot tougher than

186
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,879
if you do proper spacing and for example

187
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,479
do a lot of leaf removal where it's

188
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:27,280
necessary, you know. So it's it's just

189
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:29,120
everything. It everything can affect it.

190
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:31,879
Um living soil, you have a lot of living

191
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:35,759
soil customers. That's a particularly

192
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:38,559
challenging setting. Okay. For from what

193
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:41,200
I've seen. Um, so everyone has their

194
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:43,359
their different challenges and like I

195
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,640
think what I'm grateful for is that I

196
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,120
have a chance to work with, you know,

197
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:48,120
the kind of the gamut.

198
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:55,278
Yeah. So when you see when you walk into

199
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,879
a new grow facility or grow space, uh,

200
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:59,600
what are you sort of looking for? What's

201
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:02,480
your mental checklist in terms of uh,

202
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:05,720
IPM specifically?

203
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:08,000
Yeah. So, usually we start in

204
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:10,920
propagation. That makes sense. You know,

205
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,080
go from the least likely to be infested.

206
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:16,000
Um, and then as through each stage, you

207
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,800
know, basically take notes on what their

208
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,320
primary pest is. Um, and what and then

209
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:21,919
find out what they're doing, what

210
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,839
they've have been doing, and if they

211
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:26,079
think why they think it might be failing

212
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,399
or why they think it could be better or

213
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,920
why they think it's doing a great job.

214
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:34,958
Um and then

215
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:37,199
um you know obviously um listening like

216
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:39,559
at least in the first visit lot a lot of

217
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,320
listening and note takingaking

218
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:45,278
um that's that's important to me. Then

219
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:49,839
then you know then I I look for things

220
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:53,039
where number one to me is um the signs

221
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:55,519
and symptoms of pest presence. Okay. And

222
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:58,719
so for example um if it's an indoor

223
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:00,278
operation under lights with uh you know

224
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,240
like those the

225
00:10:00,278 --> 00:10:05,679
the I don't know what they're called the

226
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:08,480
trays um where you have a drain one side

227
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:10,479
you have a a decline declin whatever

228
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,720
it's called the slope and then you have

229
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,320
the drain on the other side that's a

230
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,920
great place to go look for for root

231
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:20,160
aphits. Um you don't have to look in in

232
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:22,078
in substrate. a lot of them crawl out

233
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:24,639
and as you irrigate the water pushes

234
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:27,479
them down to the drain. Um so that's

235
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:29,439
that's kind of one really quick, you

236
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:32,240
know, you know, that's a good pointer.

237
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,399
Yeah. Inspection. And then um you know,

238
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,240
leaf damage. You can if you look around,

239
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:39,200
you'll find either thris or spidermite

240
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,360
damage. That's super important. Um you

241
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,120
know, basically quick scouting when I

242
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,519
come into a room if they'll let me. I

243
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,919
try not to like go deep into the crop

244
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,679
until I know that they're not infested.

245
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:51,919
um just not just so I don't carry out

246
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:54,799
any any pests or move them around the

247
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:57,039
grow. Um so yeah, that's that's more or

248
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:58,958
less what I do. And then I then what's

249
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:01,519
super important to me is a follow-up.

250
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:04,000
Like my goal is to get a follow-up email

251
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:07,278
to the whoever it is that's, you know,

252
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,120
responsible for the IPM um within a week

253
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:10,879
because things have to stay fresh in

254
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,639
their mind. What we discuss, I have to

255
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:17,000
and then reiterate them, right? So

256
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:17,000
that's kind of my my approach.

257
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:23,200
Yeah. And when you write a

258
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:25,439
recommendation to a grower, it's not

259
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,200
necessarily all beneficials either. I

260
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,560
want to clarify that for folks because

261
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,160
I've seen, you know, your

262
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:32,000
recommendations for growers that we work

263
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:34,000
with that you've sent um after maybe

264
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,320
visiting the facility or talking through

265
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,879
their some of their challenges with with

266
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:41,440
pest control. Um can you give me a

267
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:42,958
sample of what something might kind of

268
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,640
look like for someone who was listening

269
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:50,239
to the podcast and is unfamiliar with

270
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:52,879
Yeah. Yeah, for sure. So, one big one

271
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,959
one big question I have is what kind of

272
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:57,200
monitoring are you doing and are you

273
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:59,838
doing it properly? Because what I'm

274
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:02,560
interested in knowing is if your

275
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,839
population of pest is to a point where I

276
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:08,958
would you would be throwing money

277
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:12,040
away to start with bio control. So, for

278
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:15,679
example, a common practice in veg is

279
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:18,639
spraying. Um, and it's probably 75% of

280
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:22,239
the people I deal with prefer to spray

281
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:23,519
for for pests in veg. Um, and that's all

282
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,440
well and good. There's very few of them

283
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,959
that are implementing bio control. It's

284
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:31,200
it's something you really have to learn

285
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:34,078
to do for the entire cycle. Um, but you

286
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:36,160
can start integrating it slowly into veg

287
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:38,078
so that you can reduce your your sprays

288
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:40,799
because sprays may not be ideal all the

289
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:42,719
time. So, I may need to know, okay,

290
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:44,399
what's your thrifts population like? And

291
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,759
they might say, well, I don't know. It's

292
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,240
a lot. I'm like, okay, what are your

293
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:50,319
yellow cards telling you? Um, I'm not

294
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,759
doing yellow cards. Okay, you need to

295
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,760
start yellow cards. What about your

296
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:56,159
fungus net? Are you doing yellow soil?

297
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:58,399
No, I'm not. Okay, you need to do that.

298
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:59,919
Start on that right now. Let's go with a

299
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,078
chemical approach until you get me some

300
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:04,000
data. We need to know when we need to

301
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:06,719
speak the same language. I have a much

302
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,679
better I I can communicate with you more

303
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,839
because I'm not going to be able to

304
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:11,159
visit your grow you know weekly or

305
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,880
whatever.

306
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:16,879
Um, if I have data from like from like

307
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,559
yellow cards or if I have for example

308
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:21,600
counts of spidermitites or counts of

309
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:24,000
spidermite eggs per leaf, you know, that

310
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,519
kind of thing, then then you know if

311
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,440
it's if it's something that I I believe

312
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:31,278
biocrol can't catch up with, then of

313
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,680
course the strategy is, hey, let's get

314
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:35,838
this down to where bio control will do

315
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:38,159
it so that you can reduce your sprays.

316
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:42,639
And that that might take a few sprays.

317
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:45,360
Um, and so I'm I'm fortunate that um, in

318
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:48,240
part of my career when I was first

319
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:51,200
getting into biological control,

320
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,839
um, I decided that I wanted to learn all

321
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:55,440
of the organic sprays that I had

322
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,760
available in California, all the

323
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,480
materials. Um, so I knew when to use

324
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:02,559
them, um, or what I could use and then

325
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,560
try them and see how well they worked

326
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:06,159
and basically got familiarity with a lot

327
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:09,838
of these materials and a lot of these

328
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:12,240
techniques. Um before jump diving in

329
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,560
head first into biorol I went into it

330
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,839
slowly so that by the time I got into

331
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:20,719
the cannabis greenhouse um I had I had a

332
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:23,199
good background on sprays but I also had

333
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:28,040
a background on starting with bios. So,

334
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:28,039
you know, um I was able to integrate.

335
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,920
Yeah. So, essentially if the So, first

336
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:35,679
off, you need to know what level of

337
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:37,599
prepest pressure you have and you need

338
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:38,799
to be able to quantify that. I think

339
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,278
that's essentially what you're saying

340
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:42,319
and that's really important. So,

341
00:14:40,278 --> 00:14:43,759
scouting, you know, I I know we could do

342
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:47,360
a whole podcast on that. You had

343
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:49,919
mentioned um it's a pretty indepth thing

344
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,480
to consider in your in your facility and

345
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:55,278
your grow. Um but then if if the pest

346
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,560
pressure is above this threshold where

347
00:14:55,278 --> 00:14:58,399
it's going to be able to be controlled

348
00:14:56,559 --> 00:15:01,679
by beneficials, then we're talking about

349
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:03,039
bringing in um you said chemical

350
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:06,319
solutions, but what you're referring to

351
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:07,759
there, not necessarily uh synthetic, but

352
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,800
it could be like an organic solution.

353
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:13,198
We're talking soaps and oils, um, or

354
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:16,639
maybe botanical, some sort of spray

355
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:20,000
option to suffocate, neurologically

356
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:22,240
disrupt, um, kill essentially the the

357
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,958
target pest to get them down to a level

358
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:27,278
that then the beneficials could

359
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:29,679
potentially control them, right? Yeah.

360
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:32,720
Yeah. Number one, most of the states

361
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:35,278
that have legalized um, they won't allow

362
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,759
you to use certain materials, right?

363
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:39,198
It's almost all organic materials. I

364
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,600
can't I can hardly think I can't think

365
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:43,519
of anyone even organic sprays that are

366
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,240
like neurotoxins like spinads aren't

367
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:48,159
allowed in the majority of states. Um

368
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,480
and some states are so strict that they

369
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:54,319
don't allow you to use an EPA registered

370
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:57,600
organic material. So um you know it's

371
00:15:54,320 --> 00:16:00,600
it's a challenge but I'm lucky because

372
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:03,680
I've focused my pest management to

373
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:06,079
organics and that's almost all I've ever

374
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:07,958
done. Uh the first job I worked in, we

375
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:10,799
did use some insecticides, some real

376
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:13,198
insecticides, but it was the goal there

377
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:14,958
was go towards organic and then after

378
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:17,439
that it's been all organic. So I know

379
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:21,119
the sprays well, I know the materials

380
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:23,920
well. Um I don't actually know, you

381
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,600
know, the the real poisons well and uh

382
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:27,519
I'm lucky not to have to ever use them.

383
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,800
So yeah, you can do it. And not only can

384
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,159
you use them, but you can actually

385
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:31,919
integrate them if you know what you're

386
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:34,319
doing. Takes some guidance, but that's

387
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:36,559
what I'm here for.

388
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,480
Yeah. And then on the flip side, an

389
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:40,319
example where you maybe not don't need

390
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,759
to do sprays because I hate spraying.

391
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:45,160
It's just the the labor to, you know,

392
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:48,000
fill a

393
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:50,159
sprayer, m tank, mix everything, go in

394
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,879
the room, spray. I just I hate doing it.

395
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:57,120
Um it's not something that I enjoy. So,

396
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:58,799
uh for me, I had I had a thris damage

397
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,519
thris that came into my room on my

398
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:03,278
clones. Um, as you know, they can I

399
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,120
believe pupate inside the leaf. Is that

400
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:08,959
correct?

401
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:11,838
So, I I didn't see um or lay eggs inside

402
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:15,038
the leaf. Sorry. I didn't see any damage

403
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:16,318
um on my plants until they had grown a

404
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:19,838
little bit, but the grower I got them

405
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:22,078
from noticed Thris's damage a couple

406
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:23,198
weeks after I got my plants from him.

407
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:25,198
So, he's like, "Okay, you need to start

408
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,839
treating for this." So, I did some dips

409
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:31,640
and sprays um to try and get them under

410
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:34,720
control. And then I did a a release of

411
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:36,720
beneficials after, you know, my after

412
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,200
after a couple rounds of sprays. And

413
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,600
then the next cycle, I had very little

414
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:44,919
thris damage that cycle. But the next

415
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:48,319
cycle in that room, I just

416
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:49,919
preventatively released uh some SF

417
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:51,759
nematodes into the soil because the room

418
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,360
had been empty for a couple months and I

419
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:55,759
didn't see any thris damage that next

420
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:58,000
cycle. Um, you know, I do like to treat

421
00:17:55,759 --> 00:18:00,720
plants when I first bring them in. But I

422
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,038
guess my point is, um, if you have a

423
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,400
very low pest pressure or maybe your

424
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:05,440
last round you had a little bit of pest

425
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,400
pressure, that's where I think

426
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:10,480
beneficials really shine, I guess,

427
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,160
especially early in veg because you

428
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:16,480
don't have to buy a lot of them

429
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:17,919
necessarily. And, um, if you know,

430
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,440
spraying, like you mentioned, can't get

431
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:22,400
everywhere, whereas these beneficials

432
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,400
are eating and working 24/7. uh and

433
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,160
they'll work their way into all the

434
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,960
little nooks and crannies of your of

435
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,960
your canopy to really get your target

436
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:35,440
pest.

437
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:37,759
Yeah. I mean key there in um the way to

438
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:40,798
make bio control successful is to

439
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:43,839
realize that it is much much better as a

440
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:46,480
preventative tool than than it is as um

441
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:49,918
a curative. Um there are some biocontrol

442
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:52,558
agents that actually can essentially

443
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:55,600
cure a problem or bring it down so that

444
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:58,319
it's so low that um you know that it's

445
00:18:55,599 --> 00:19:01,519
nowhere it's not going to hurt you. Um

446
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:04,720
like SF nematodes being one of them. Uh

447
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:07,759
you can take a a a a greenhouse that's

448
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,839
just loaded with fungus nads and if you

449
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:11,759
use the SF nematodes properly, it's

450
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:13,759
going to be a bit expensive at first.

451
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:16,000
you can get it down to where, you know,

452
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:17,079
they're not an issue anymore. But that

453
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,319
is an

454
00:19:17,079 --> 00:19:22,720
exception. Okay. Most of most biocrol

455
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:24,399
works, you know, and should be used

456
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,600
preventatively. What does that mean?

457
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:30,240
That means at the first sign of pests is

458
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:32,399
when you is when you really start. Um,

459
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,679
if you have the budget to get just get

460
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,160
them in there before you've even seen

461
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,679
any pests, obviously that's even better.

462
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,200
But most growers are going to say,

463
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,798
"Well, I'm not going to do make an

464
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,880
action until I know they're there."

465
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:45,679
Right? And that's fine as long as you

466
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:48,480
know when they when they are at a very

467
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:51,519
low population. So what's that mean?

468
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:55,839
Again, you know, I I told you earlier my

469
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:58,000
mantra is scouting is the basis of of of

470
00:19:55,839 --> 00:20:00,319
success for biological control. So

471
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,759
knowing what you have, what pest you

472
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:06,639
have, where is it, and how much of it is

473
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:08,319
there. Um that's like key to having bio

474
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:12,640
control succeed. And I don't think I

475
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:15,918
don't think um a lot of I've noticed I

476
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:18,240
have my experience is that compared to

477
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:21,400
other greenhouse crops like ornamental

478
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:24,279
and food crops and and and foliage

479
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:28,400
crops, the cannabis

480
00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:32,639
grower might miss that concept, might

481
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:34,480
not might not have that ingrained. Um

482
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:38,200
and why?

483
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:41,360
likely because they they were growers

484
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:42,960
during the black market days, right,

485
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:45,359
before it was legal. So, you could just

486
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:48,480
take Avid and wipe out your spidermite

487
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:50,879
issue with one spray or keep it low. So,

488
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,200
they're kind of used to more like, okay,

489
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:56,000
curative, curative, I can cure this.

490
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:58,159
Biocrol won't do that. Organics

491
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,798
materials won't do that either. They're

492
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:03,520
very rarely curative. So, it's kind of

493
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:05,599
switching that mentality to I want to I

494
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:08,319
need to do this preventatively based on

495
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:10,240
scouting.

496
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:12,399
Yeah. I remember 20 years ago, and this

497
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,400
is probably a pretty common story where

498
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,759
I didn't really think about pests. I

499
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,080
mean, I wasn't being around I wasn't

500
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:20,240
around any other cannabis grows. It was

501
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:23,119
just my own grow in my garage at the

502
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,960
time. And uh so I figured I was pretty

503
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:28,000
safe, you know, if it was just me going

504
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:30,319
in the room. And then I didn't catch uh

505
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,400
I end up I ended up getting thris

506
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:33,839
somehow. They got into the space and I

507
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,320
didn't catch it right away because I

508
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:37,599
wasn't scouting as carefully as I I

509
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:40,158
should have at the time and I didn't

510
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:42,719
really know how to deal with it. Um and

511
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:44,440
so I I got I got a little too late to

512
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,640
the game and I hadn't even heard of

513
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:49,600
beneficials 20 years ago. So, that was

514
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:52,480
all um I had a lot of learning to do,

515
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:54,798
but um man, I'd forgotten about Avid and

516
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,880
Eagle 20 and some of these horrible

517
00:21:54,798 --> 00:21:59,599
chemistries that people used back in the

518
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:02,240
day. Um I'm glad that we have better

519
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:04,079
solutions now, even if they're not

520
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,200
systemic, which is sort of the point of

521
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:08,960
it. It's not going to end up in your

522
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:11,360
final flower. Um

523
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,960
well, let's talk a little bit. I want to

524
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:14,439
change directions here and talk a little

525
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,200
bit about

526
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:20,000
um russet mites, hemp russet mites. I've

527
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:22,720
been hearing and seeing more issues with

528
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,919
russetss. Okay. Uh as of lately, I mean,

529
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,079
I know they've been a problem for a

530
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:28,960
while, but um what are some of your

531
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:31,759
options for russet mites

532
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,840
or recommendations, I guess? So, first

533
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:36,158
off, I I want to like make an

534
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:39,678
announcement on biological control of

535
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:41,440
russet mites. There are anecdotal

536
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:43,120
reports out there that certain predatory

537
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:48,159
mites that are commercially available

538
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:50,798
can help you. Okay. My actual experience

539
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:52,480
um and actually if you talk to Suzanne I

540
00:22:50,798 --> 00:22:56,319
think she's in agreement that there is

541
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:58,599
no reliable con convent commercially

542
00:22:56,319 --> 00:23:02,960
available predatory might. Some folks

543
00:22:58,599 --> 00:23:05,839
have mentioned um the Anderson might um

544
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:08,240
but again it's all anecdotal. um it may

545
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:10,240
be there but if you look at it you'll

546
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,919
see failures with anderson but you'll

547
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,960
also won't be able to find any

548
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:16,559
scientific literature basically not much

549
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,279
at least showing that anderson can help

550
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:23,279
you with with arrestmite and there's

551
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:27,200
very little lit or if any on biological

552
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:29,200
control of hemp reset might okay now

553
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:33,120
this is going to sound like a commercial

554
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:36,159
but it's something I'm excited about um

555
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:37,759
began production of a predatory might.

556
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:41,360
It's in the same family as all the rest

557
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:43,119
of the predatory mites. That might is um

558
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:45,399
commonly known as the western predatory

559
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:48,038
might because it's in all of the western

560
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:51,559
states.

561
00:23:48,038 --> 00:23:53,720
Um the scientific name is galandromis

562
00:23:51,558 --> 00:23:55,720
oxididentalis. Among us we call them

563
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:57,480
oxies.

564
00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:00,720
Um this

565
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:03,200
might is primarily going to be used in

566
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:06,120
certain crops in outdoor crops. there's

567
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:08,600
a demand for it. Um

568
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:11,678
but it is known to

569
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:14,158
be more of a generalist predatory might

570
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:17,120
if I can say that. Um so what I mean by

571
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:20,880
that is um pimileus would would be a

572
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:22,959
very specific predator that focuses on

573
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:26,720
two spotted spidermite. It won't even

574
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:29,759
feed on and control may feed but it

575
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:32,319
won't control certain species within the

576
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:35,519
same genus as the two-spotted spider

577
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:38,319
might. It it's a it's specifically

578
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:41,200
focused on that might. It it co-evolved

579
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:43,759
with that might is what I understand.

580
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,038
But then you have neelis calapernicus.

581
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:47,960
So I'm sort of people have heard of

582
00:24:45,038 --> 00:24:50,158
which will also feed on for example

583
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:51,759
broadmite and might help you manage

584
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:54,240
broadmite and there's literature showing

585
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:56,798
that and the two spotted spidermite and

586
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,558
can also feed on you know pollen. So

587
00:24:56,798 --> 00:25:01,079
it's more of a generalist if you get

588
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:02,798
what I'm saying. Um

589
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:06,158
gallandroxalis the way I like to

590
00:25:02,798 --> 00:25:08,158
describe it is that it's a like a like a

591
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:10,480
the most generalist of the predatory

592
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:13,640
mites. Okay. And so we're excited

593
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:20,079
because in nature

594
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:22,960
um it will feed on the area family which

595
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:27,639
is the family of pest mites to which

596
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:30,919
hempresses belongs. So you you have it

597
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:35,520
recommended by like the University of

598
00:25:30,919 --> 00:25:38,320
California as the go-to for certain area

599
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:41,119
feed species like for example tomato

600
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:44,639
russet might um which is in the same

601
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:46,959
genus as hemp russetmite. So our hope is

602
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:49,440
now that we have it to be able to

603
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,840
basically debut it in cannabis to see

604
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:54,000
what impacts there are. So if anyone is

605
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:56,079
interested and has an existing hemp

606
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,839
breast my problem, we're just about

607
00:25:56,079 --> 00:26:00,319
getting ready to launch this, but we

608
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:03,519
have some production going where we

609
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:07,839
definitely want to see it feeding and

610
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:10,000
would like to to um to get video of it.

611
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:12,399
U my colleague already has video of it

612
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,200
feeding on hemp rust. It might so it's

613
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,559
clear that they'll eat it. Controlling

614
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:19,120
it yet to be seen because it's never

615
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:21,200
been tried. So that's my bio control.

616
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:24,158
just want I'm I'm putting it out there

617
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:26,440
because we want to get the data. Um,

618
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:29,840
currently though, very

619
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:32,240
um effective way. Go ahead. I'm sorry.

620
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:34,480
So, Salt. Yeah. Before we get into uh

621
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,720
the current your current recommendations

622
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,960
around hemp russet, I wanted to touch on

623
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,240
this a couple things that you just

624
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,720
mentioned that I think are really

625
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,640
important. one uh this is a really

626
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:47,839
really big deal because I I remember

627
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:50,799
talking to Kelly Vance about this uh

628
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:52,798
years ago actually and um I know he's

629
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:55,200
been pushing for it and one of the big

630
00:26:52,798 --> 00:26:57,038
reasons that you and him I think ended

631
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,759
up at Biobe was because you were so

632
00:26:57,038 --> 00:27:03,038
excited for this might and access to it

633
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:04,200
and what it may offer the the uh growing

634
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:07,200
community.

635
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:08,640
Um so the other thing so I just want to

636
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,038
throw that out there this is a big deal.

637
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:15,360
Uh the second thing that you had also

638
00:27:11,038 --> 00:27:18,158
mentioned um is control versus feed and

639
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:20,719
I just want to highlight that too. So

640
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:22,799
you know russet mites live in the in the

641
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:25,919
bud within those tricoms. They're very

642
00:27:22,798 --> 00:27:27,519
hard to um that area is very hard to

643
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:29,520
navigate. It's sticky. It's you know

644
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:32,639
same with tomatoes sort of thing. And

645
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:36,639
so, um, this idea that like I think you

646
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:40,720
mentioned Anderson may feed on russet

647
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:44,000
mites, um, you know, in a petri dish or

648
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:45,919
or something, um, but maybe not able to

649
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,679
control it and navigate that space as

650
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:49,600
well as a russet or effectively enough

651
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:52,480
to control in the sense of keeping

652
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:55,119
populations low enough not to have uh,

653
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,798
economic damage to your crop. Uh so

654
00:27:55,119 --> 00:28:00,959
you're we're we're hopeful you're

655
00:27:56,798 --> 00:28:03,440
hopeful that Galandrois will be able to

656
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:06,159
do that based on the literature and what

657
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:08,159
you guys have seen. But um I think

658
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:09,679
that's an important distinction between

659
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,960
something that's able to feed something

660
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,038
and on something and something that's

661
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:15,600
able to feed on it so effectively that

662
00:28:13,038 --> 00:28:18,240
it's able to control it below an

663
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:20,319
economic threshold.

664
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:23,839
Absolutely. And it's something that

665
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:25,839
Suzanne preaches and I'm very glad she,

666
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:29,519
you know, highlights that just because

667
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:32,119
an animal can feed on another animal

668
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:34,720
doesn't mean it would control an

669
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:36,459
infestation. Um I don't know if you've

670
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,640
seen the videos, but

671
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:40,798
[Music]

672
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:42,120
um there's a video of an of a deer

673
00:28:40,798 --> 00:28:44,798
eating a

674
00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:46,000
bird. Literally just sticks and needs.

675
00:28:44,798 --> 00:28:47,918
These are herbivores. They're not

676
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,519
supposed to be doing that. I don't think

677
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:54,399
that you would buy a deer to to get rid

678
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:55,798
of like I don't know a bird pest problem

679
00:28:54,398 --> 00:28:59,839
in your on

680
00:28:55,798 --> 00:29:01,918
your right. You're not um that's the

681
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:04,000
same thing we and and the the tricky

682
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:07,679
part is that it it is often crop

683
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,359
dependent and also um dependent on other

684
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:10,798
factors. But you know just because it

685
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:12,398
can control something in this crop

686
00:29:10,798 --> 00:29:16,038
doesn't necessarily mean it'll control

687
00:29:12,398 --> 00:29:18,719
that same pest in another crop. Um, and

688
00:29:16,038 --> 00:29:22,158
then just because it'll it has been

689
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,919
shown to control a pest in your

690
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:26,000
particular crop doesn't mean it'll do it

691
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:30,038
in every case. And I'll give you the the

692
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:33,278
primary example for that um is um

693
00:29:30,038 --> 00:29:36,798
amblyas cucumber. So the cucumber might

694
00:29:33,278 --> 00:29:38,398
which I'm sure people are aware of an

695
00:29:36,798 --> 00:29:40,240
inexpensive might probably the least

696
00:29:38,398 --> 00:29:42,639
expensive predatory might out there.

697
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:45,159
used for thris management, very

698
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:49,399
successfully used for thres management.

699
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:51,760
Um, but also successfully used for

700
00:29:49,398 --> 00:29:53,038
broadmite or cyclon might in

701
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:54,359
strawberries. There's a lot of

702
00:29:53,038 --> 00:29:56,440
literature showing

703
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:59,240
that.

704
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:02,240
However, it does not prefer

705
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:03,919
broadmite. It would rather eat thris.

706
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,000
So, what happens when you have a thris

707
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:08,720
infestation along with a broadmite

708
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:12,319
infestation? You may not get biorol

709
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:14,960
unless potentially you just inundate it.

710
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:19,038
So that now the cucumber is like

711
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:21,600
everyone wants to eat you know the steak

712
00:30:19,038 --> 00:30:23,919
not everyone gets the steak. Somebody

713
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:26,719
has to stay alive you have to eat the

714
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:28,640
broccoli.

715
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:31,919
Yeah. So they they may be preferential.

716
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:34,320
And with the um gallendrois I know you

717
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:35,919
had mentioned to me that they also like

718
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:38,558
two spotted spider mightites. So if you

719
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:41,200
have a twospotted infestation along with

720
00:30:38,558 --> 00:30:43,359
a russet mite infestation, your

721
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,038
hypothesis was that they would probably

722
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:47,678
control the two spotted first just

723
00:30:45,038 --> 00:30:50,558
because they're larger

724
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:52,240
um and maybe more delicious in the eyes

725
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:53,759
of galandrois.

726
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,319
Yeah. I mean if you if you think about

727
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:58,079
it um so just some some research if you

728
00:30:56,319 --> 00:31:00,240
look at what Cornell University has to

729
00:30:58,079 --> 00:31:04,158
say about galendronosis oxidant talis in

730
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:08,640
certain crops like like uh uh palm fruit

731
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:11,840
and and um stone fruit they will feed on

732
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:15,440
the you know the respective russet might

733
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:20,398
of those crops but those crops also get

734
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:23,120
a a a bunch of other you know other pest

735
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:25,759
mites from the tetranic family, which is

736
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:29,239
the same one that two spotted spider

737
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:31,839
might belongs to, and several other non

738
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:34,720
tetrronicid larger mice that are

739
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:36,720
potentially more nutritious, right? So,

740
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:39,360
if you have that infestation going on,

741
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:41,038
it could fail for the russet might in

742
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:43,359
your tree. But if you have a clean if

743
00:31:41,038 --> 00:31:45,440
you're if you've got a clean crop with

744
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:46,719
no other like preferable food, there's a

745
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,360
better chance that it can help you with

746
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:51,798
rust at night.

747
00:31:48,359 --> 00:31:55,079
So my thoughts on it

748
00:31:51,798 --> 00:31:57,679
is, you know, getting

749
00:31:55,079 --> 00:32:01,759
your populations of twospotted

750
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:04,399
spidermite as low as possible or um your

751
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:07,440
thris population as low as possible,

752
00:32:04,398 --> 00:32:09,918
then there's a better chance that gallon

753
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,480
oxidant can help you with rustite and

754
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:16,320
that you know say as cucumber can help

755
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:18,399
you with with broadmite

756
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:20,960
and that's why we need people like you

757
00:32:18,398 --> 00:32:22,798
to offer, you know, technical support

758
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,240
for this sort of thing because it's a

759
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:25,918
lot to know about and there's a lot of

760
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,240
research that goes into it and expertise

761
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:30,399
that, you know, people like myself even

762
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:33,120
don't have. I pick up all that I can

763
00:32:30,398 --> 00:32:35,000
from you guys. Um, but at the end of the

764
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:37,158
day, if I need a if I need a

765
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,038
recommendation, um, or I have an

766
00:32:37,159 --> 00:32:42,080
infestation, I'm going to come to you

767
00:32:39,038 --> 00:32:44,480
and get get some advice. And so on that

768
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:46,158
note, uh specifically, let's just stick

769
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,839
with russetss, uh since we've been

770
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:50,480
talking about them. What would be a more

771
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:53,519
traditional recommendation for russetss

772
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:55,919
knowing that uh there has not

773
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:58,480
historically been any biological options

774
00:32:55,919 --> 00:33:01,080
that control rustites?

775
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:04,159
Yeah. So,

776
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:07,439
um back when I started at Harborside

777
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:12,159
Farms as IPM manager, this was this was

778
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:17,519
2017, I believe. I can't remember. Um I

779
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:20,399
walked into a russet might wildfire and

780
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:23,038
I did not know that pest. I was from

781
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:24,678
organic herbs. Never dealt with an area

782
00:33:23,038 --> 00:33:26,960
of feed.

783
00:33:24,679 --> 00:33:28,720
Um first thing I did is what are your

784
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:31,919
scouting reports about this? What do you

785
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:33,919
mean scouting? Um okay well do you have

786
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:37,278
scouts? Well we have people that

787
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:38,559
reported this. Do they carry loops? Um,

788
00:33:37,278 --> 00:33:40,640
this was at the point where we were

789
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:42,918
where we didn't have anything like what

790
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:45,320
is set up for example in an ornamental

791
00:33:42,919 --> 00:33:48,159
greenhouse. Um,

792
00:33:45,319 --> 00:33:50,000
so you can't see them without a loop. So

793
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:51,360
immediately busted out my loop, started

794
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,798
looking, found them. Okay, I know what

795
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:54,558
rust might like. Okay, what have you

796
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:56,000
been using? Well, we've been using this

797
00:33:54,558 --> 00:33:57,678
soil and this oil and this soil, but

798
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,640
it's not doesn't seem to work. Okay, let

799
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:03,278
me dive in. Dove into the its closest

800
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:05,120
relative. Um, that's that is a pest in

801
00:34:03,278 --> 00:34:06,558
another crop is a tomato russet

802
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:08,799
mightite. All right, what are they

803
00:34:06,558 --> 00:34:11,039
doing? The go-to for them was elemental

804
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:14,079
sulfur sprays. All right, so if it works

805
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:17,119
for them that relative, it should work

806
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:19,440
for us in cannabis. Um, so that was the

807
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:21,039
first first sort of step to in the in

808
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:23,519
the direction. Um, what we didn't know

809
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:25,918
at the time was how concentrated your

810
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:28,398
spray had to be and what frequency you

811
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:32,000
had to apply it. Okay, because there's

812
00:34:28,398 --> 00:34:33,519
negatives to spraying sulfur. Um, but

813
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,280
eventually came around to figuring out

814
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:37,519
exactly what the rate and frequency of

815
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,440
the sprays should be to manage and then

816
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:41,838
other techniques that I learned

817
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:44,878
subsequent to that to help to have you

818
00:34:41,838 --> 00:34:48,878
manage um, hempressescent might

819
00:34:44,878 --> 00:34:50,960
relatively easy with elemental sulfur

820
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:54,239
sprays. I still believe that if it comes

821
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:56,320
to a spray, and I think that probably a

822
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:57,519
good 90% of the cannabis community would

823
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,760
agree with me, at least those that have

824
00:34:57,519 --> 00:35:02,159
battled it, that you're better off with

825
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:05,839
a sulfur spray than you are with an oil

826
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:08,399
spray. Um, and there's disagreement, but

827
00:35:05,838 --> 00:35:10,078
I think I what I run into more is

828
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:13,358
success with using elemental sulfur

829
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:16,000
sprays, but there are drawbacks to using

830
00:35:13,358 --> 00:35:18,799
sulfur. There's a a few really important

831
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,800
drawbacks.

832
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,480
Well, let's talk about it. I know we we

833
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:25,519
originally recorded this whole podcast

834
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:27,920
and I think 15 or 20 minutes of it uh

835
00:35:25,519 --> 00:35:30,559
turned into talking about the pros and

836
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:33,760
cons of sulfur. Uh, unfortunately we

837
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:36,000
lost the recording uh due to technical

838
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:38,720
issues, but let's let's let's do a

839
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,880
little bit of a pros and cons around

840
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:42,480
sulfur because you you and the last time

841
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,838
we did it, you took the pro side and I

842
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,358
took the con side and we kind of talked

843
00:35:43,838 --> 00:35:47,679
about what those were because I've heard

844
00:35:45,358 --> 00:35:51,279
some I've heard from Suzanne why she

845
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:54,480
does not like sulfur as much as you do.

846
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:57,920
But, uh, it is very effective in certain

847
00:35:54,480 --> 00:36:00,000
instances dealing with certain pests. So

848
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:03,519
let's dive into it. What are some of the

849
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,800
advantages and disadvantages of using

850
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:07,199
sulfur? And let's talk a little bit

851
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:10,320
about uh burning sulfur which

852
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:13,358
technically I don't think is allow legal

853
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:15,280
in any crop. Um but people do it. So

854
00:36:13,358 --> 00:36:17,358
let's let's have a a short conversation

855
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:20,920
about that just knowing that it's

856
00:36:17,358 --> 00:36:24,400
happening. Um and then

857
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:26,159
alsible sulfur sprays. Okay. So on

858
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,240
burning sulfur, yeah, like you said, it

859
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:31,358
it was very commonly practiced. There's

860
00:36:28,239 --> 00:36:35,239
still devices for it um in green houses,

861
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:39,039
but at least in California, um I guess

862
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:42,078
the whoever whatever agency is the in

863
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:44,159
charge of like fires and you know,

864
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:46,960
whoever manages the fire departments at

865
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:50,239
the top of the state um said no more.

866
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:52,800
It's way too risky to leave these hot

867
00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:55,039
lamps in a greenhouse. we've had too

868
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:59,039
many instances. So that's actually the

869
00:36:55,039 --> 00:37:00,880
reason why it was um it was um outlawed

870
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:03,358
at least here in California was very

871
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:05,440
effective for powdery mildew. So that

872
00:37:03,358 --> 00:37:09,199
forced the growers to go a different

873
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:09,880
direction. Um I believe if you want to

874
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:13,159
be

875
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:16,480
compliant in most states you can't burn

876
00:37:13,159 --> 00:37:17,598
sulfur. Um but again that's a big if.

877
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,159
Some people don't care about being

878
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:22,640
compliant. It's a different story. Um it

879
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:25,279
is more it's probably more efficient to

880
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:27,679
use it to burn it than it is to spray

881
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:30,640
it. It's you know it's in a vapor form.

882
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:33,199
It covers the entire um greenhouse. It

883
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:34,639
may be less effective, more efficient

884
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:37,519
but less effective for a number of

885
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:40,400
reasons. Um so that's my take on burning

886
00:37:37,519 --> 00:37:42,639
sulfur. As far as pros and cons of using

887
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,760
sprayable sulfur, I'm going to start

888
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:48,879
with the cons that I think are

889
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:51,359
legitimate cons. Okay. Um, so number one

890
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:53,920
and most important to me is we don't

891
00:37:51,358 --> 00:37:57,039
know what impact the uh the sulfur

892
00:37:53,920 --> 00:38:00,639
residue has on the ability of biological

893
00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:03,239
control agents to hunt for their prey.

894
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:06,799
It could be disruptive because it is

895
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:10,159
volatile and a lot of these predators

896
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:11,839
use alactory cues to find their prey. So

897
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:15,598
it could interrupt us and that's a very

898
00:38:11,838 --> 00:38:17,599
legitimate uh concern. Another one is go

899
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:19,280
ahead. So, so let's let's just uh

900
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:23,480
clarify that. So, you're saying after

901
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:26,560
spraying sulfur uh and waiting I don't

902
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:28,880
know a few days or whatever week, you

903
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:30,519
bring in your beneficial insects, you're

904
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:33,760
saying there still could be some

905
00:38:30,519 --> 00:38:35,519
volatizing sulfur in the coming off of

906
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,160
that leaf surface that may make it hard

907
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:40,079
for those beneficials

908
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:42,239
to track down their predators because

909
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:44,880
they use their sense of smell. and this

910
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:47,759
sulfur is still creating an odor. And

911
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:51,200
then um we don't have any research to

912
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:53,760
know either way on that. Yeah, nothing

913
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:57,039
really legitimate yet, just anecdotal.

914
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:59,599
Um and it's not that it can stick around

915
00:38:57,039 --> 00:39:04,159
for a few days. It does stick around for

916
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:07,119
a few days. And in fact, in my pros, I

917
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:10,000
will mention why that's important. Um in

918
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:10,838
my anecdotal experience where I've seen

919
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,639
it

920
00:39:10,838 --> 00:39:20,239
used seen sulfur used I have

921
00:39:15,639 --> 00:39:23,598
encountered a very robust bio control uh

922
00:39:20,239 --> 00:39:26,799
management. So, in my experience, it

923
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:30,000
didn't seem to impact the predatory

924
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:32,960
mites we were using and the parasettoid

925
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:36,440
wasps we were using or the lace wing.

926
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:39,039
Um, aphids and and thris and

927
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:42,639
spidermitites were being managed by

928
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:44,239
predators after a sulfur spray. Um, now

929
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:45,920
what does that mean? Does that mean you

930
00:39:44,239 --> 00:39:48,078
have to go in with a higher number of

931
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:50,000
predators immediately after a sulfur

932
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:53,200
spray or a more frequent release until

933
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:56,920
that sulfur dissipates? Maybe. Maybe

934
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:59,919
that's what it means. Um, and maybe not.

935
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:01,440
Um, so that's my take on on that. It's a

936
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:03,480
legitimate concern. We don't have the

937
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:06,519
research point saying one or the other

938
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:10,320
yet. Okay.

939
00:40:06,519 --> 00:40:12,960
Um, I do know that the recommendations

940
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:16,320
from those that have done research like

941
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:19,440
to say wait 4 days before releasing

942
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:22,240
predatory mites um I don't know where

943
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:24,079
they got that um the four days from it

944
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:28,078
but it is based on research and I think

945
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:30,880
it's less about can it um can it hunt

946
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:33,359
properly more like do you put them at

947
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:35,039
risk if you release between four within

948
00:40:33,358 --> 00:40:37,880
the ne within four

949
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:40,880
Um, so yeah, that's what I have on on

950
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:42,480
that. Um, so that's what that's a

951
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:45,519
legitimate concern for me. The other

952
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:49,119
concern that's really important is using

953
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:53,280
oils is effective. A lot of of of pests

954
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:56,318
in cannabis um not desired in certain

955
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:57,599
stages. For example, maybe week three of

956
00:40:56,318 --> 00:40:58,800
flower, now you're talking about

957
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:01,920
something that might be hurting you more

958
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:04,480
than helping you. Um, so like I said,

959
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:06,240
maybe a good 75% of of the cannabis

960
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,960
growers I've worked with do use oils in

961
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:10,399
veg. So using oils in veg is effective.

962
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,720
There may be some drawbacks to using

963
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:15,838
oils. You know, some some growers

964
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:18,399
believe that they block stamata, so

965
00:41:15,838 --> 00:41:20,960
photosynthesis is um reduced, so growth

966
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:23,720
is reduced, plant health's reduced. Um,

967
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:27,199
then there's also the possibility of

968
00:41:23,719 --> 00:41:29,439
phytotoxicity using oils. This is where

969
00:41:27,199 --> 00:41:31,199
another legitimate concern is with

970
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:35,200
sulfur. If you look at most sulfur

971
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:36,838
materials, they do not recommend using

972
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:39,838
an oil

973
00:41:36,838 --> 00:41:42,559
spray next to a sulfur spray that you've

974
00:41:39,838 --> 00:41:44,159
got to give it a 30-day wait. In my

975
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:46,799
experience, that's been more like a two

976
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:51,440
week wait. And now that pe that folks

977
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:53,599
are using lower rates of sulfur, um it

978
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:55,760
could even be less than. but that it

979
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:57,359
does complicate the use of oils if

980
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:59,720
that's a practice that you already

981
00:41:57,358 --> 00:42:02,480
comfortable with.

982
00:41:59,719 --> 00:42:04,639
Um, another con which you brought up

983
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:08,318
last time which is very legitimate is

984
00:42:04,639 --> 00:42:11,598
that all of the EPA registered

985
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:14,239
uh midocidal fungicidal sulfur products

986
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:17,039
have a 24-hour restricted entry

987
00:42:14,239 --> 00:42:20,199
interval. In other words, c the growers

988
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:23,358
and the workers can't go into the

989
00:42:20,199 --> 00:42:26,318
crop for 24 hours after a spray and that

990
00:42:23,358 --> 00:42:28,559
interferes with some operations. And

991
00:42:26,318 --> 00:42:30,199
also the the available products can only

992
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:35,239
be used once a week according to the

993
00:42:30,199 --> 00:42:38,480
label. So that is another another con.

994
00:42:35,239 --> 00:42:41,479
Um again to all of these cons I have

995
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:43,599
ways to clear the hurdle.

996
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:45,920
Um let's see what else. It's good it's

997
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:48,480
good to mention both. Um

998
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:50,720
yeah so REI or restricted entry

999
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:53,440
intervals are very important to follow.

1000
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:56,239
Um they're created for a reason. Now do

1001
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:59,079
we always understand those reasons? No.

1002
00:42:56,239 --> 00:43:02,879
I think you brought that up last uh last

1003
00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:04,960
conversation. But um as a facility with

1004
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:08,318
liabilities and just health risks, it's

1005
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:10,079
probably best to stick to those. Um yep.

1006
00:43:08,318 --> 00:43:12,480
In theory, there's research to support

1007
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:14,560
that. Most states, including California,

1008
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:16,838
have whistleblower laws. So if an you

1009
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:19,039
get a disal employee that that shows you

1010
00:43:16,838 --> 00:43:20,599
that learns that you're not following

1011
00:43:19,039 --> 00:43:23,358
REI

1012
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:24,480
um that they could they could cause a

1013
00:43:23,358 --> 00:43:27,519
lot of problems. They could get you

1014
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:30,159
fined um you know because there are

1015
00:43:27,519 --> 00:43:32,159
whistleblower laws. So employees in an

1016
00:43:30,159 --> 00:43:36,159
agriculture operation are protected by

1017
00:43:32,159 --> 00:43:39,279
by the state if they you know report

1018
00:43:36,159 --> 00:43:41,679
lapses in you know the way you handle

1019
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:44,160
pesticides which is a good thing right.

1020
00:43:41,679 --> 00:43:46,879
Um, it's also why you need a pesticides

1021
00:43:44,159 --> 00:43:50,159
license as a as an applicator in

1022
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:52,880
California specifically. Um, yeah, all

1023
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:57,358
these things exist for to for worker

1024
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:59,039
safety. Mhm. Yep. Um, one other one

1025
00:43:57,358 --> 00:44:01,759
other con since we're on the con side

1026
00:43:59,039 --> 00:44:03,679
still, uh, I wanted to bring up was you

1027
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:05,760
already talked about residues. Um,

1028
00:44:03,679 --> 00:44:07,239
sulfur is an essential mineral for

1029
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:10,520
plants.

1030
00:44:07,239 --> 00:44:13,199
um it creates those

1031
00:44:10,519 --> 00:44:15,519
uh esters and alcohols that sort of that

1032
00:44:13,199 --> 00:44:18,960
skunky smell in in cannabis. So, we know

1033
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:22,480
we need sufficient in our soils. Um

1034
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:24,559
however, I worry about heavy metals

1035
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:26,159
potentially spraying heavy metals onto

1036
00:44:24,559 --> 00:44:28,719
our flower. So, even if there's just

1037
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:32,078
trace amounts, let's say two to five

1038
00:44:28,719 --> 00:44:34,799
parts per million of uh lead or arsenic

1039
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:36,480
or cadmium on in that sulfur. And again,

1040
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,839
I this is

1041
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:40,079
I'm not saying this is the case, but

1042
00:44:37,838 --> 00:44:42,400
it's worth researching your your product

1043
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:44,359
source because if you fail for heavy

1044
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:46,720
metals because of a residue, that would

1045
00:44:44,358 --> 00:44:48,639
be that would be awful, you know, on a

1046
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:50,078
crop because you sprayed sulfur or

1047
00:44:48,639 --> 00:44:51,440
anything that you're spraying really.

1048
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:53,039
This doesn't apply specifically to

1049
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,960
sulfur. This applies to anything that

1050
00:44:53,039 --> 00:44:58,960
we're applying to our crop seaweed or to

1051
00:44:54,960 --> 00:45:02,159
our soil. Seaweed and uh anyone using

1052
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:04,639
shrimp kiten um all of those are there's

1053
00:45:02,159 --> 00:45:07,679
a risk of metals, mercury in particular,

1054
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:09,679
right? Um, yeah. So, it's a legitimate

1055
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:12,239
concern. It is another one. You beat me

1056
00:45:09,679 --> 00:45:15,838
to it. Um,

1057
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:19,439
it it was brought up by Suzanne that she

1058
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:21,759
had a customer who reported who failed

1059
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:24,159
for metals, tested their sulfur product,

1060
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:25,440
and found that it had had them. Um, so

1061
00:45:24,159 --> 00:45:28,399
here's what I have to say about that.

1062
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:32,000
again. No, I'm going to go into the the

1063
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:36,240
the the pros afterwards, but yeah, that

1064
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:41,280
that could be a risk of your particular

1065
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:44,399
brand of sulfur having a um having heavy

1066
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:46,400
metals in it. It is a risk. That all

1067
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:49,838
being said, I've never experienced that

1068
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:52,240
with any of my customers, but it is a

1069
00:45:49,838 --> 00:45:54,599
risk. Um and I can tell you why. It's

1070
00:45:52,239 --> 00:45:57,838
probably that I haven't experienced it.

1071
00:45:54,599 --> 00:45:59,318
Um, so another con I can think of is

1072
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:03,199
most

1073
00:45:59,318 --> 00:46:06,279
states have laws as to what materials

1074
00:46:03,199 --> 00:46:09,759
you can and can't use.

1075
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:09,760
The the

1076
00:46:10,838 --> 00:46:15,838
majal

1077
00:46:12,358 --> 00:46:17,960
sulfur p wetable powder products that

1078
00:46:15,838 --> 00:46:21,358
are available

1079
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:24,358
to crops, all different kinds of crops,

1080
00:46:21,358 --> 00:46:28,759
including organic crops.

1081
00:46:24,358 --> 00:46:32,519
um are EPA registered

1082
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:36,000
and there's none that I know of in

1083
00:46:32,519 --> 00:46:40,159
California that are allowed if you're

1084
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:42,639
trying to be compliant. So that's a huge

1085
00:46:40,159 --> 00:46:45,799
issue there is okay if if you're using a

1086
00:46:42,639 --> 00:46:50,159
traditional sulfur elemental sulfur

1087
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:52,318
product you are and something that's

1088
00:46:50,159 --> 00:46:55,279
used by for example strawberry or grape

1089
00:46:52,318 --> 00:46:59,759
grape growers um you're likely going to

1090
00:46:55,280 --> 00:47:02,720
be non-compliant by using it. Uh so you

1091
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:05,599
know yeah that's big. It is if you want

1092
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:07,838
to be compliant you know uh there's no

1093
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:10,880
testing for sulfur that doesn't mean

1094
00:47:07,838 --> 00:47:13,920
that you don't want to be compliant. Um

1095
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:17,838
you know until those laws are changed

1096
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:19,358
based on research. Um you know you want

1097
00:47:17,838 --> 00:47:22,480
to be compliant. You want to be able to

1098
00:47:19,358 --> 00:47:24,559
sell to the legal market. That's that is

1099
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:26,000
a con.

1100
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:29,279
All right, let's talk about the pros

1101
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:32,079
because you uh you're a sulfur guy. I

1102
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:34,920
am, but I should preface everything. And

1103
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:38,680
if if Suzanne, if you're watching

1104
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:41,599
this, always remember this

1105
00:47:38,679 --> 00:47:45,598
preface. I am not a sulfur guide. I

1106
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:48,240
would I recommend it used only very

1107
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:50,640
limited circumstances because of all of

1108
00:47:48,239 --> 00:47:52,838
the cons. Okay, not all cons, because of

1109
00:47:50,639 --> 00:47:57,199
the majority of the cons.

1110
00:47:52,838 --> 00:48:01,880
Um, that being said, I'm convinced it is

1111
00:47:57,199 --> 00:48:04,358
the best treatment for russet mites and

1112
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:07,760
broadmmitites in

1113
00:48:04,358 --> 00:48:11,358
veg. That that I can say. I don't

1114
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:13,960
believe in using it unless you've got

1115
00:48:11,358 --> 00:48:16,880
rusted might or broadmite.

1116
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:19,318
However, several of the growers I work

1117
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:20,920
with have

1118
00:48:19,318 --> 00:48:24,318
anecdotally

1119
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:27,519
reported health benefits to sprays the

1120
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:30,838
sulfur sprays. It it is my understanding

1121
00:48:27,519 --> 00:48:36,280
it can be absorbed by the foliage.

1122
00:48:30,838 --> 00:48:39,519
So now the other pro or the first pro

1123
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:43,319
um I believe it's superior to oils in

1124
00:48:39,519 --> 00:48:46,800
many regards because oils are a

1125
00:48:43,318 --> 00:48:48,719
contact only um kill. Now there there's

1126
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:51,440
some herbal oils that are also also have

1127
00:48:48,719 --> 00:48:52,959
repellent repellency but mainly the mode

1128
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:54,960
of action the main mode of action of

1129
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:58,800
sprays is contact. If you don't get the

1130
00:48:54,960 --> 00:49:00,880
oil to contact the pest, you won't kill

1131
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:03,920
it because it'll dry and that's it. One

1132
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:06,160
and done, right? Um,

1133
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:08,318
which is harder on these two particular

1134
00:49:06,159 --> 00:49:10,159
pests because of where they live.

1135
00:49:08,318 --> 00:49:12,960
They're tiny. They can get in the

1136
00:49:10,159 --> 00:49:14,759
crevices and something so tiny, unless

1137
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:19,000
you're using some kind of

1138
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:22,640
a effective aduant to thin out your

1139
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:25,719
spray, they can even be protected by,

1140
00:49:22,639 --> 00:49:28,719
you know, um what's the word? The the

1141
00:49:25,719 --> 00:49:31,519
hydrophobicity or the um the lack of

1142
00:49:28,719 --> 00:49:35,519
ability to spread in these tiny crevices

1143
00:49:31,519 --> 00:49:38,639
or underneath tricoms, right? So the

1144
00:49:35,519 --> 00:49:40,960
oils are hard. It's hard to contact them

1145
00:49:38,639 --> 00:49:44,799
and they don't last very long. Whereas

1146
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:47,280
sulfur what few are aware of is sulfur

1147
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:50,800
is used routinely in grapes and I used

1148
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:52,960
to work in in wine industry. So I I

1149
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:56,720
learned about sulfur. I learned about

1150
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:58,559
its mode of action um some time ago and

1151
00:49:56,719 --> 00:50:01,919
it has actually a two-fold mode of

1152
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:04,720
action. It's contact. Okay. And it's not

1153
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:08,200
that it suffocates the way oils do, but

1154
00:50:04,719 --> 00:50:12,879
it's also um residual or

1155
00:50:08,199 --> 00:50:15,598
um the vapor form of of of sulfur also

1156
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:18,480
is toxic. This is the powdery mildew. My

1157
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:24,359
belief is that if you perform a sulfur

1158
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:27,400
spray and you miss a colony of russet

1159
00:50:24,358 --> 00:50:31,358
mites, but the residue is there pumping

1160
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:34,880
out, you know, the the volatiles,

1161
00:50:31,358 --> 00:50:37,358
um the gas attack can actually have this

1162
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:39,599
residual effect and that's why it's so

1163
00:50:37,358 --> 00:50:42,639
effective. Even if you don't contact,

1164
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:44,039
which is a kill, the gas can still kill,

1165
00:50:42,639 --> 00:50:46,799
right?

1166
00:50:44,039 --> 00:50:49,159
So, something to really consider, oils

1167
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:52,559
can't do that for you.

1168
00:50:49,159 --> 00:50:55,199
Um, one of the back to oils, one of the

1169
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:57,519
pros, you might say, well, what about

1170
00:50:55,199 --> 00:50:58,799
the phytotoxicity risk, the 30 days or

1171
00:50:57,519 --> 00:51:00,280
two weeks you have to wait between

1172
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:04,079
sprays. All

1173
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:05,920
right, that is true. Okay, and it's on

1174
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:07,079
the label and I've experienced it

1175
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:11,159
myself.

1176
00:51:07,079 --> 00:51:13,519
Um, however, subsequent to me being in

1177
00:51:11,159 --> 00:51:15,679
production, growers have figured out

1178
00:51:13,519 --> 00:51:18,079
some strategies on how to reduce that

1179
00:51:15,679 --> 00:51:19,919
time. And the best strategy I've seen,

1180
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:22,640
which is

1181
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:25,358
um really cool, is actually to spray

1182
00:51:22,639 --> 00:51:27,118
your sulfur and wash wash it off

1183
00:51:25,358 --> 00:51:29,279
afterwards. Of course, then you're

1184
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:31,119
before an oil spray. You're limiting the

1185
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:33,280
residual if you're doing that right to

1186
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:35,440
the the time that you the time between

1187
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:37,760
spray and when you wash it off. but

1188
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:39,599
you're also removing it so that

1189
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:41,440
effectively removing it from the leaf

1190
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:44,160
surface so that you can come in with an

1191
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:46,240
oil spray and less less risk of burn.

1192
00:51:44,159 --> 00:51:49,039
Um, the other thing that's been learned

1193
00:51:46,239 --> 00:51:52,719
more recently is I was using it at rates

1194
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:55,920
that were effective based on what I

1195
00:51:52,719 --> 00:51:58,159
learned and researched, but it turns out

1196
00:51:55,920 --> 00:52:02,240
that growers over time started using

1197
00:51:58,159 --> 00:52:04,639
less and less less lower rates down to

1198
00:52:02,239 --> 00:52:07,919
half of what I was using were some some

1199
00:52:04,639 --> 00:52:10,799
growers are having um an impact. So,

1200
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:13,400
less sulfur residue, easier to wash off,

1201
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:16,480
less even less risk of burn.

1202
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:18,000
So that's sort of my how I clear that

1203
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:20,240
whole issue. You have to time it

1204
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,400
properly, right? You have to do the

1205
00:52:20,239 --> 00:52:24,159
right thing so you you can avoid the

1206
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:25,639
burn or at least reduce the risk of

1207
00:52:24,159 --> 00:52:29,279
burn.

1208
00:52:25,639 --> 00:52:32,118
Um what else? Um how do I clear the

1209
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:36,720
hurdle on of heavy metals?

1210
00:52:32,119 --> 00:52:39,680
Um first off, again, in my experience,

1211
00:52:36,719 --> 00:52:42,598
it's never happened. And in the

1212
00:52:39,679 --> 00:52:46,239
experience of Suzanne, she said it

1213
00:52:42,599 --> 00:52:48,240
happened. I've asked for the name of the

1214
00:52:46,239 --> 00:52:50,279
product so that I could do a little dive

1215
00:52:48,239 --> 00:52:53,199
into it. I haven't gotten that

1216
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:56,160
yet. What makes you suspicious of of

1217
00:52:53,199 --> 00:52:59,439
sulfur being actually a source of heavy

1218
00:52:56,159 --> 00:53:02,000
metals is um back in the day sulfur was

1219
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:04,960
mined. Okay, we know there are metals in

1220
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,880
the in the earth. Sulfur was mined um

1221
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:08,480
and then purified in whatever process.

1222
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:10,559
And so the risk there is there. It's

1223
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:12,400
very clearly there. Nowadays, my

1224
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:14,240
understanding is the majority of sulfur

1225
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:17,440
that's used in agriculture is actually

1226
00:53:14,239 --> 00:53:19,439
distilled from some other source. What

1227
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:22,039
does that what does distillation mean?

1228
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:25,920
You cannot easily

1229
00:53:22,039 --> 00:53:29,119
move how can you get to the vapor point

1230
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:31,440
or the gas stage of mercury? You

1231
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:34,720
probably need to be on the surface of

1232
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:36,960
the sun to do that. So distillation

1233
00:53:34,719 --> 00:53:38,719
probably removes a lot of that metal

1234
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:40,559
potential metal contamination. And if

1235
00:53:38,719 --> 00:53:43,199
the majority of sulfur products have

1236
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:45,200
that have are are distilled, then maybe

1237
00:53:43,199 --> 00:53:48,639
you're, you know, it's not such a

1238
00:53:45,199 --> 00:53:50,719
terrible con or a risk. Um, but what you

1239
00:53:48,639 --> 00:53:52,879
can always do is take whatever sulfur it

1240
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:55,199
is you're using and submit it for metals

1241
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:56,640
analysis on a regular basis and confirm

1242
00:53:55,199 --> 00:53:58,399
to yourself that yeah, in fact, this is

1243
00:53:56,639 --> 00:54:00,318
clean or even contact the company and

1244
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:02,519
ask for like a lot analysis and they

1245
00:54:00,318 --> 00:54:05,358
can't. they oftent times will test for

1246
00:54:02,519 --> 00:54:07,639
metals. Um, so that's my hurdle there.

1247
00:54:05,358 --> 00:54:10,318
The hurdle on the

1248
00:54:07,639 --> 00:54:12,159
REI, that's a weird one. It's a really

1249
00:54:10,318 --> 00:54:14,079
weird one because the fungicide and

1250
00:54:12,159 --> 00:54:18,558
midside products that I mentioned, the

1251
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:22,160
EPA registered are 24hour, but there are

1252
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:26,119
some elemental sulfur folure sprays that

1253
00:54:22,159 --> 00:54:29,838
are not through the EPA. In other

1254
00:54:26,119 --> 00:54:32,640
words, they are not pesticides because

1255
00:54:29,838 --> 00:54:35,000
they're being used as nourishment,

1256
00:54:32,639 --> 00:54:38,879
folure nourishment.

1257
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:43,599
Um, it's elemental sulfur. This plant

1258
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:47,760
can use sulfur in its metabolism, right?

1259
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:50,160
So, there are some materials that don't

1260
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:51,760
don't qualify as pesticides. Now, why is

1261
00:54:50,159 --> 00:54:54,639
it they don't qualify as pesticides?

1262
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:57,400
could be all had to do with the inactive

1263
00:54:54,639 --> 00:55:00,558
ingredients. What else is in the

1264
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:04,000
pesticidal sulfur that is not in the

1265
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:08,000
folure feed sulfur? Um, and the folure

1266
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:10,000
feed sulfur actually have lower REIs.

1267
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,760
Okay, that doesn't mean that it's safer.

1268
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:14,719
Okay, but for whatever reason, the

1269
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:18,400
governing body has determined the REI

1270
00:55:14,719 --> 00:55:21,919
is, for example, as short as two hours,

1271
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:25,519
right? Um, still, you know, why not wait

1272
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:26,960
if you can, right? U, there's no no law

1273
00:55:25,519 --> 00:55:29,280
that says you have to go in after two

1274
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:31,679
hours, right? But there's also the

1275
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:35,839
possibility that

1276
00:55:31,679 --> 00:55:37,679
um the research is done for the research

1277
00:55:35,838 --> 00:55:40,480
was done to find that a combination of

1278
00:55:37,679 --> 00:55:42,159
the active and the inactive make it

1279
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:44,240
you're probably safer to go for the 24

1280
00:55:42,159 --> 00:55:46,318
hours. I don't know. Okay. I just have

1281
00:55:44,239 --> 00:55:50,719
that to say. I just have to that that to

1282
00:55:46,318 --> 00:55:52,079
throw out. Um what was another Go ahead

1283
00:55:50,719 --> 00:55:53,919
real quick. First of all, I know you had

1284
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:55,680
mentioned that one of the things that's

1285
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:58,400
really important to look at is

1286
00:55:55,679 --> 00:56:01,118
application uh frequency, but also

1287
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:03,599
application rate. What is your

1288
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:06,160
recommended rate based off of what

1289
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:08,000
you've seen in facilities? All right.

1290
00:56:06,159 --> 00:56:09,759
I'm not going to make a recommendation.

1291
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:12,880
All right. Okay. I'm going to give you

1292
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:16,839
my experience. All right. Okay. Fair

1293
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:23,000
enough. with with a compa with a comp

1294
00:56:16,838 --> 00:56:28,519
um with a product that I used which

1295
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:31,400
was about 80% elemental sulfur so 20%

1296
00:56:28,519 --> 00:56:35,400
inactive at the

1297
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:39,440
time I was using 20 grams per

1298
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:41,200
gallon and I was applying twice a week.

1299
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:43,318
Okay. All of that was in compliance with

1300
00:56:41,199 --> 00:56:47,279
the product. All

1301
00:56:43,318 --> 00:56:50,000
right, that was working for me when

1302
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:53,160
again when I had a rust that might pop

1303
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:57,838
up. All right.

1304
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:59,920
Um, now subsequent to that that time,

1305
00:56:57,838 --> 00:57:01,838
like I said, growers have figured out to

1306
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:04,079
reduce that all all the way down to 10

1307
00:57:01,838 --> 00:57:06,239
grams per gallon, although I think most

1308
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:08,200
growers are using about 15 grams per

1309
00:57:06,239 --> 00:57:11,439
gallon with an

1310
00:57:08,199 --> 00:57:13,039
80% elemental sulfur product. So, you

1311
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:14,720
can translate it however you'd like.

1312
00:57:13,039 --> 00:57:15,960
There are others that have lower sulfur,

1313
00:57:14,719 --> 00:57:19,318
whatever.

1314
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:22,559
Um, what was I going to say

1315
00:57:19,318 --> 00:57:24,159
regarding these sprays? It'll pop up. It

1316
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:25,920
was an appropriate time to say it right

1317
00:57:24,159 --> 00:57:28,159
there when we were were just talking.

1318
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:31,039
I'm sorry for interrupting you. Um, I

1319
00:57:28,159 --> 00:57:34,000
know what it was. Go ahead. So what was

1320
00:57:31,039 --> 00:57:36,318
key for me again this is my mantra is

1321
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:40,480
the monitoring having good scouts that

1322
00:57:36,318 --> 00:57:43,199
can identify russet might as early as

1323
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:45,519
possible. What does that mean? I had a

1324
00:57:43,199 --> 00:57:49,118
scout who I would call her the russet

1325
00:57:45,519 --> 00:57:51,519
whisperer. All right because she could

1326
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:54,000
practically smell I swear she could

1327
00:57:51,519 --> 00:57:57,199
smell where russet might was. And

1328
00:57:54,000 --> 00:58:00,159
sometimes I get a text and she'd she'd

1329
00:57:57,199 --> 00:58:03,358
say, "Hey, um, I want you to look at

1330
00:58:00,159 --> 00:58:04,639
something." I'm like, "Uh, no. You I

1331
00:58:03,358 --> 00:58:06,719
know what you're I know what you're

1332
00:58:04,639 --> 00:58:09,519
telling me. You you've smelled them

1333
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:11,239
out." And sure, she could look at um

1334
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:14,159
leaf

1335
00:58:11,239 --> 00:58:16,399
color in very young leaves and find

1336
00:58:14,159 --> 00:58:18,239
russet might infestations very early on.

1337
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:20,160
You have a better chance of getting rid

1338
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:21,919
of them faster when it when it's just

1339
00:58:20,159 --> 00:58:24,879
started. Unfortunately, you don't know

1340
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:27,920
when the infestations are just starting

1341
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:29,599
because usually the effects the the

1342
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:32,318
symptoms of the plant don't pop up until

1343
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:34,079
after you have a sizable infestation.

1344
00:58:32,318 --> 00:58:35,679
But that was that showed me the

1345
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:37,760
importance of monitoring and having good

1346
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:41,480
scouts that are trained to ID these

1347
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:44,160
these symptoms as early as possible.

1348
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:46,400
Then when we found it, it's like, okay,

1349
00:58:44,159 --> 00:58:48,318
all hands on deck, track and trace

1350
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:49,838
because we know it's in this clone and

1351
00:58:48,318 --> 00:58:51,279
we know that it in this strain and we

1352
00:58:49,838 --> 00:58:52,480
know that it came from clones from those

1353
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:53,839
moms over there. So the first thing

1354
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:55,760
we're doing is going to look at it, look

1355
00:58:53,838 --> 00:58:57,199
for it in those moms. Okay. And the

1356
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:59,520
second thing we're doing is any crops

1357
00:58:57,199 --> 00:59:02,000
that are were for example cloned and and

1358
00:58:59,519 --> 00:59:04,559
and propagated before this particular

1359
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:07,119
crop and are farther ahead including

1360
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:09,920
potentially even in flower are probably

1361
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:11,680
might have it. So let's focus on what

1362
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:13,599
just like they did in covid time track

1363
00:59:11,679 --> 00:59:15,039
and trace where did this come from who

1364
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:17,680
did you talk to who did you meet who

1365
00:59:15,039 --> 00:59:19,239
were you around who subsequently before

1366
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:22,480
you ID it before you

1367
00:59:19,239 --> 00:59:24,239
got diagnosed who also may have may have

1368
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:25,920
spread it to so that's was super

1369
00:59:24,239 --> 00:59:28,479
important and then you start really

1370
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:30,960
intense scouting identify the plants

1371
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:33,159
that have it mark them and then do a

1372
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:36,159
sulfur spray because you want to come

1373
00:59:33,159 --> 00:59:37,838
back within a few days literally kill

1374
00:59:36,159 --> 00:59:40,399
was often

1375
00:59:37,838 --> 00:59:42,000
within 24 hours percent of the

1376
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:44,480
population had been reduced. That was

1377
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:46,480
amazing to me. Um, but if you can, you

1378
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:48,159
need to continue to go back and scout at

1379
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:49,519
those plants until you're sure you got

1380
00:59:48,159 --> 00:59:51,838
them all because again, you're not going

1381
00:59:49,519 --> 00:59:53,039
to always get them all. Um, and and

1382
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:54,960
you're not going to get you may not get

1383
00:59:53,039 --> 00:59:57,759
the eggs with sulfur. They it may not

1384
00:59:54,960 --> 01:00:01,039
kill the eggs. So you need to go back

1385
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:02,480
and um usually in my experience again

1386
01:00:01,039 --> 01:00:04,239
this was way back when I'm sure growers

1387
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:07,119
have gotten better but within two weeks

1388
01:00:04,239 --> 01:00:09,039
I was of sulfur sprays I was in good

1389
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:12,559
shape with whatever infestation I found.

1390
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:14,880
So that's super key.

1391
01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:16,798
Yeah. I want to I want to mention

1392
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:19,519
something that is important on the

1393
01:00:16,798 --> 01:00:20,960
scouting side. So and this is maybe this

1394
01:00:19,519 --> 01:00:23,119
will help folks because this is a recent

1395
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:25,679
story. We had a guy reach out to us that

1396
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:29,480
thought he had a fertility issue. And so

1397
01:00:25,679 --> 01:00:31,919
we started digging into this and uh

1398
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:34,159
basically what we found was this problem

1399
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:37,200
was happening at his facility, but it

1400
01:00:34,159 --> 01:00:39,440
was also happening at his his uh

1401
01:00:37,199 --> 01:00:41,519
partner's facility and they cultivate

1402
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:43,760
different ways. So the chances of that

1403
01:00:41,519 --> 01:00:46,239
being a fertility issue versus a pest or

1404
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:47,920
pathogen is less likely. It's more

1405
01:00:46,239 --> 01:00:49,838
likely that there's a pest involved or a

1406
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:52,480
pathogen. In this case, it turned out to

1407
01:00:49,838 --> 01:00:55,358
either be russetss or broads. I have I'm

1408
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:57,679
waiting to get um an image to really

1409
01:00:55,358 --> 01:01:00,558
determine that. But um one of the other

1410
01:00:57,679 --> 01:01:03,598
clues that we had was is this across all

1411
01:01:00,559 --> 01:01:05,920
of your plants evenly or is it is it in

1412
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:08,000
one place specifically? And basically

1413
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:10,079
what we found was oh it's worse over in

1414
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,599
this area. And yeah, they were they were

1415
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:13,039
doing living soil beds. So there's a

1416
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:15,039
chance that you know the fertility was

1417
01:01:13,039 --> 01:01:16,558
different across there. But most likely

1418
01:01:15,039 --> 01:01:18,318
if you're treating all your beds the

1419
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:21,760
same and you have a what we call a hot

1420
01:01:18,318 --> 01:01:24,239
spot, um it it's it's most likely a pest

1421
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:25,920
or pathogen issue. And so then we want

1422
01:01:24,239 --> 01:01:29,519
to we want to dig into that a little

1423
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:32,639
further. So if you see it just with um

1424
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:35,199
you know across multiple genetics or in

1425
01:01:32,639 --> 01:01:37,639
one part of your room or in one room

1426
01:01:35,199 --> 01:01:40,719
versus all of your rooms um and it's

1427
01:01:37,639 --> 01:01:43,039
spreading uh it's more it's less likely

1428
01:01:40,719 --> 01:01:45,838
that it's fertility. And I just want to

1429
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:47,599
bring that up as some clues for folks.

1430
01:01:45,838 --> 01:01:51,358
Yeah, you need to know how to identify

1431
01:01:47,599 --> 01:01:54,798
russet mites for sure. And in, you know,

1432
01:01:51,358 --> 01:01:56,798
a future podcast, hopefully we can do my

1433
01:01:54,798 --> 01:01:59,039
presentation on signs and symptoms of

1434
01:01:56,798 --> 01:02:00,880
common cannabis pests, which includes

1435
01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:02,480
the russet might, you know, signs and

1436
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:03,838
symptoms, but you really do need to know

1437
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:06,559
how to use them. And there's a method

1438
01:02:03,838 --> 01:02:09,759
that I developed. I didn't develop it.

1439
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:11,680
It came from a cla a pathology class um

1440
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:14,480
that makes scouting for rusted broad

1441
01:02:11,679 --> 01:02:17,118
rusted and broad mites a lot easier. Um

1442
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:19,280
but it it's something that some of the

1443
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:21,519
growers I've worked with have have tried

1444
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:23,200
and they like it. It makes it fast for

1445
01:02:21,519 --> 01:02:26,000
faster scouting, but I'll go over that

1446
01:02:23,199 --> 01:02:28,239
on a maybe on the scouting um podcast

1447
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:30,079
when you want to do that. Um unless

1448
01:02:28,239 --> 01:02:32,159
anybody wants to reach out, I can I can

1449
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:34,000
talk to them about it. But um but yeah,

1450
01:02:32,159 --> 01:02:38,078
that is that is key. What's interesting

1451
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:40,159
about russet might is um you know the

1452
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:42,318
the they don't they're not great movers.

1453
01:02:40,159 --> 01:02:44,078
They're little carrots with feet, right?

1454
01:02:42,318 --> 01:02:48,558
To them for them to move from one plant

1455
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:51,440
to another is um it's it's tough. But so

1456
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:53,280
you'll often find one plant that is just

1457
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:55,200
loaded with them and the neighbors

1458
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:57,040
aren't have a few of them, right? And

1459
01:02:55,199 --> 01:02:59,358
they're because they're touching. That's

1460
01:02:57,039 --> 01:03:01,519
that's I've noticed that it's um and

1461
01:02:59,358 --> 01:03:04,078
then that spot does grow. Okay. and and

1462
01:03:01,519 --> 01:03:06,639
it can grow fast but that's often a case

1463
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:09,119
where you find one plant. Um, one key I

1464
01:03:06,639 --> 01:03:12,000
want to I want to I'd like my

1465
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:14,280
observation for monitoring um rustmite

1466
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:16,199
is when you get

1467
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:19,839
into

1468
01:03:16,199 --> 01:03:22,719
flower it in my experience tends to hit

1469
01:03:19,838 --> 01:03:25,519
those really lower flowers down you know

1470
01:03:22,719 --> 01:03:28,719
even sometimes down on the trunk of the

1471
01:03:25,519 --> 01:03:31,199
plant before I see them up above. I

1472
01:03:28,719 --> 01:03:33,038
don't know why that is, but you start I

1473
01:03:31,199 --> 01:03:35,519
start to see the symptoms, particularly

1474
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:37,440
the the leaf curl, you know, the the

1475
01:03:35,519 --> 01:03:40,719
taco or whatever you want to call it, um

1476
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:43,838
the canoe, um down there in those little

1477
01:03:40,719 --> 01:03:45,919
teeny flowers. Um so, might not be a bad

1478
01:03:43,838 --> 01:03:47,759
idea when you're scouting through a

1479
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:49,358
flower when you see those to take a look

1480
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:51,760
for those symptoms down there. It might

1481
01:03:49,358 --> 01:03:54,199
alert you to where it is and possibly

1482
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:59,599
that it's just starting,

1483
01:03:54,199 --> 01:04:02,719
right? So, yeah. about sorry a con that

1484
01:03:59,599 --> 01:04:04,000
I forgot about sulfur is most growers

1485
01:04:02,719 --> 01:04:05,759
don't want to use it in flour and I

1486
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:10,079
don't recommend it. So making sure you

1487
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:14,880
come in clean into into flour with no

1488
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:17,839
sulfur is smart. It's it's critical and

1489
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:20,079
some growers will use a sulfur spray

1490
01:04:17,838 --> 01:04:22,239
right before they flip or right when

1491
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:25,359
they're done with their um two weeks

1492
01:04:22,239 --> 01:04:28,399
into before the flower primordia. Um,

1493
01:04:25,358 --> 01:04:29,679
and it's not a bad idea. If in fact, if

1494
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:32,400
somebody's going to just use what we

1495
01:04:29,679 --> 01:04:33,598
call calendar spraying, that that would

1496
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:35,680
be the one spray that I would say,

1497
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:37,760
"Yeah, that's a smart move where you're

1498
01:04:35,679 --> 01:04:40,399
you're you're giving it one last shot."

1499
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:42,319
Now, luckily now, if all goes well,

1500
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:45,119
hopefully some growers will help us do

1501
01:04:42,318 --> 01:04:48,318
it. We have a biocrol agent, which is

1502
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:49,920
attractive to use in flour, um, which

1503
01:04:48,318 --> 01:04:52,880
which is not going to taint the flavor

1504
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:56,400
of the of the of the product, um, with

1505
01:04:52,880 --> 01:05:00,000
gallon drumalis. So that would be super

1506
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:02,240
cool. If russetss get past you in veg,

1507
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:04,880
maybe there's a non-spray solution in

1508
01:05:02,239 --> 01:05:06,639
flour.

1509
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:08,720
Yeah, I just wanted to mention one other

1510
01:05:06,639 --> 01:05:10,639
clue for us. And the reason this one

1511
01:05:08,719 --> 01:05:12,798
threw me was because I hadn't seen a

1512
01:05:10,639 --> 01:05:14,719
plant this far into flower with this bad

1513
01:05:12,798 --> 01:05:18,000
of an infestation. I just hadn't come

1514
01:05:14,719 --> 01:05:20,879
across it yet. Uh but we had flower buds

1515
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:22,480
that were um that looked awful. you

1516
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:25,358
know, they were displaying every sort of

1517
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:27,119
what could look like a deficiency. Um,

1518
01:05:25,358 --> 01:05:28,880
you know, the the tacoing, the

1519
01:05:27,119 --> 01:05:31,280
discoloration in the leaf, some

1520
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:35,119
necrosis, uh, premature browning of

1521
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:39,119
pistols, uh, poor development. Um, but

1522
01:05:35,119 --> 01:05:40,559
the fan leaves looked great, normal. So,

1523
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:42,160
the fertility on the fan leaves looked

1524
01:05:40,559 --> 01:05:43,440
really good. The buds looked terrible. I

1525
01:05:42,159 --> 01:05:46,480
put a picture up recently on my

1526
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:49,280
Instagram um, of that and and most

1527
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:51,679
people clued right in on russetss uh, or

1528
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:53,039
broad mites. And I I sent it to Suzanne

1529
01:05:51,679 --> 01:05:55,358
and she actually was leaning towards

1530
01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:57,039
broad mites, but um I have yet to get a

1531
01:05:55,358 --> 01:06:00,159
positive idea. It could potentially be

1532
01:05:57,039 --> 01:06:02,319
either. So, you have a scope.

1533
01:06:00,159 --> 01:06:04,558
They did not have a scope. So, that was

1534
01:06:02,318 --> 01:06:06,639
a lesson learned for them. They're both

1535
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:08,000
locations now are are getting scopes and

1536
01:06:06,639 --> 01:06:10,719
they're hopefully going to send me a

1537
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:12,960
picture. So, I'm waiting on that. But,

1538
01:06:10,719 --> 01:06:14,639
yeah, we uh we got them a a

1539
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:16,720
recommendation for, you know, sort of

1540
01:06:14,639 --> 01:06:19,679
what we talked about here as a way to

1541
01:06:16,719 --> 01:06:21,519
address this moving forward. But um

1542
01:06:19,679 --> 01:06:23,279
yeah, it's a powerful lesson of why it

1543
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:25,239
is important to scout so you can avoid

1544
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:27,519
getting that far into flower

1545
01:06:25,239 --> 01:06:28,558
and you know to a point where you can no

1546
01:06:27,519 --> 01:06:30,559
longer deal with it and now you're

1547
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:32,480
facing crop loss or significant crop

1548
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:35,319
yield loss.

1549
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:40,199
What in my opinion is

1550
01:06:35,318 --> 01:06:43,239
the most dangerous arthropod pests of

1551
01:06:40,199 --> 01:06:45,759
cannabis being russet

1552
01:06:43,239 --> 01:06:47,598
mites and the fact that you can't see

1553
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:49,039
those with the naked eye and unless you

1554
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:51,838
have some experience it's they're

1555
01:06:49,039 --> 01:06:53,680
difficult to find with loops. I don't

1556
01:06:51,838 --> 01:06:58,000
see why every cannabis scourge doesn't

1557
01:06:53,679 --> 01:07:01,519
invest a 100 bucks on a microscope that

1558
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:03,920
can help you ID russet mites and broad

1559
01:07:01,519 --> 01:07:08,000
mites. I can't see it. It's literally

1560
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:09,599
you can get them for 100 bucks. Um

1561
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:11,280
yeah, since we're doing video here, and

1562
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:13,680
I know not everyone can see it, but I

1563
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:15,519
have my I have my Dino Light, which

1564
01:07:13,679 --> 01:07:18,879
unfortunately is significantly more

1565
01:07:15,519 --> 01:07:22,559
expensive than $100 nowadays. Um I also

1566
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:25,838
bought this like cheapo Amazon uh hooks

1567
01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:28,559
up to my phone and takes photos. Uh and

1568
01:07:25,838 --> 01:07:30,159
this works good enough to get uh you

1569
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:32,880
know to see hempress it. It's not as

1570
01:07:30,159 --> 01:07:34,399
high of a quality image, but yeah. Oh,

1571
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:36,559
you got one, too. It looks like the same

1572
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:39,599
one even. So, yeah, I think, you know,

1573
01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:42,000
and mine at the time was like $30. So,

1574
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:43,920
they're really is no excuse for not

1575
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,920
having something some sort of microscope

1576
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:48,079
that you can you can take images with. I

1577
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:51,039
totally agree. But yeah, I like this

1578
01:07:48,079 --> 01:07:55,519
little thing. Um, it's obviously not

1579
01:07:51,039 --> 01:07:56,960
the, you know, Cadillac dinoite. Um, I

1580
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:59,119
recommend if you can afford it. You

1581
01:07:56,960 --> 01:08:00,720
know, there are some affordable dino

1582
01:07:59,119 --> 01:08:03,440
lights, too, that are probably better

1583
01:08:00,719 --> 01:08:06,558
than the $30 one that you and I have,

1584
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:08,240
but this is more than sufficient. Okay.

1585
01:08:06,559 --> 01:08:11,039
And and also train yourself because you

1586
01:08:08,239 --> 01:08:13,118
can see them with loops. I I I know how

1587
01:08:11,039 --> 01:08:15,839
to It's not tough if you just train

1588
01:08:13,119 --> 01:08:17,199
yourself. Um yeah, there are some

1589
01:08:15,838 --> 01:08:20,798
strategies on how you can see them

1590
01:08:17,198 --> 01:08:22,399
better with loops, too.

1591
01:08:20,798 --> 01:08:24,000
Well, S, I feel like we covered a lot

1592
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:25,439
today. Hey, I'd love to get you back on

1593
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:27,520
because there's so much more around the

1594
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:29,358
insect world to talk about. Um, I'm

1595
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:31,199
really grateful for the relationship

1596
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:33,520
that we have with Biobe and the ability

1597
01:08:31,198 --> 01:08:36,079
to, you know, work with you guys. And so

1598
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:38,719
when we do sell insects to our growers

1599
01:08:36,079 --> 01:08:41,198
and we we ship direct from insectory um

1600
01:08:38,719 --> 01:08:44,399
directly from you guys to the grower um

1601
01:08:41,198 --> 01:08:47,198
which I think is important uh we we can

1602
01:08:44,399 --> 01:08:50,000
always turn to you guys or put growers

1603
01:08:47,198 --> 01:08:52,318
that work with us in touch with you as a

1604
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:54,560
way of getting that sort of support that

1605
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:56,319
extra technical knowledge. Um and

1606
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:58,159
there's no extra cost to that because

1607
01:08:56,319 --> 01:09:01,359
that's part of that's literally your job

1608
01:08:58,158 --> 01:09:04,318
which is so wonderful to our customers.

1609
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:06,600
That's what we offer. um our c your

1610
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:09,199
customers are our customers.

1611
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:12,400
Um again, it's that's just part of the

1612
01:09:09,198 --> 01:09:15,358
deal. I may not be able to visit all the

1613
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:18,079
time. I'm based in California, but I do

1614
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:21,679
make it up to the Pacific Northwest. In

1615
01:09:18,079 --> 01:09:25,359
fact, I'm there at the be at the end of

1616
01:09:21,679 --> 01:09:28,640
the month. Um although I'm there briefly

1617
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:30,560
in Portland. Um, but there are times uh

1618
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:33,520
when I'm up there more frequently and I

1619
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:34,960
can actually do visits. Um, and any of

1620
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:37,199
your customers in California obviously

1621
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:39,838
easier to visit. I already visited one

1622
01:09:37,198 --> 01:09:42,158
of them in is it Long Beach? I can't

1623
01:09:39,838 --> 01:09:45,119
remember. Um, yeah, down in Southern

1624
01:09:42,158 --> 01:09:47,039
California. Um, it's it's to me this is

1625
01:09:45,119 --> 01:09:49,679
fun. I you could probably tell I can

1626
01:09:47,039 --> 01:09:51,519
talk about this for hours. Um, and you

1627
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:54,319
know, and then there's nothing as

1628
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:56,239
satisfying really to me than giving

1629
01:09:54,319 --> 01:09:58,719
advice to a grower, having the grower

1630
01:09:56,238 --> 01:10:01,039
work with me to integrate it into their

1631
01:09:58,719 --> 01:10:03,198
program, and then getting the the report

1632
01:10:01,039 --> 01:10:04,960
back. Hey, guess what? This solved it.

1633
01:10:03,198 --> 01:10:07,759
This did it. Why? Because it validates

1634
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:11,359
that, you know, I'm not just giving BS

1635
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:12,960
information out there. Um,

1636
01:10:11,359 --> 01:10:14,799
yeah, absolutely. I feel the same way on

1637
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:17,039
the fertility side when we're able to

1638
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:19,039
get growers off of, you know, bottled

1639
01:10:17,039 --> 01:10:21,760
nutrients or a multitude of products and

1640
01:10:19,039 --> 01:10:23,359
simplify it with soil testing um and

1641
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:25,039
save the money and and produce a high

1642
01:10:23,359 --> 01:10:28,960
quality flower. Yeah, that's that's why

1643
01:10:25,039 --> 01:10:30,800
we do what we do. So, yeah. Well, we'll

1644
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:33,198
definitely catch up again soon. Super

1645
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:39,640
grateful for this time and uh thank you

1646
01:10:33,198 --> 01:10:39,639
again. Yeah, Tad. Thank you. Anytime.
