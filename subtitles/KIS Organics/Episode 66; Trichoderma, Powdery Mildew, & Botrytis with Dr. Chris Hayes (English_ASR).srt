00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,699
welcome to the cannabis cultivation and

3
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,100
science podcast

4
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:25,199
I'm your host tad hussy of kiss organics

5
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,699
this is the podcast where we discussed

6
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,830
the cutting edge of growing from a

7
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:30,449
science-based perspective and drawn top

8
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:32,460
experts from around the industry to

9
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:34,440
share their wisdom and knowledge this

10
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,840
week's podcast is with plant pathologist

11
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:39,599
Chris Hayes Chris began his journey into

12
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,430
biological while working on his PhD then

13
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,800
continued in the field while scientist

14
00:00:41,429 --> 00:00:45,780
at Cornell University at Cornell he

15
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:48,869
worked on the strains of Trichoderma T

16
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,939
22 and G 41 that would ultimately become

17
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:53,759
the active ingredients in Richfield plus

18
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:55,289
he left Cornell approximately 25 years

19
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:57,359
ago to help start Bioworks

20
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:59,280
for the past quarter century he has

21
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:01,079
worked at various areas within Bioworks

22
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,299
with the ultimate goal of helping those

23
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:05,189
interested in using biologicals to

24
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:06,688
understand the do's and don'ts to

25
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:08,879
maximize the effectiveness of

26
00:01:06,688 --> 00:01:11,489
biologicals and programs to help prevent

27
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:14,399
plant sickness and loss now on to the

28
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:17,938
podcast hey Chris thanks for coming on

29
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,609
the show today thank you for having me

30
00:01:17,938 --> 00:01:22,649
tad yeah Chris can we start off talking

31
00:01:20,609 --> 00:01:24,420
a little bit about your background and

32
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:28,829
let people know kind of who you are and

33
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:31,409
then go from there I sure can hello

34
00:01:28,828 --> 00:01:35,459
everyone out there my name is dr. Chris

35
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:37,920
Hayes and I hail from the farmlands of

36
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:39,589
central Illinois and always had an

37
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,060
interest growing up looking at

38
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:44,368
alternatives to using synthetic

39
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:49,469
chemistry's to try to grow healthy

40
00:01:44,368 --> 00:01:51,959
plants and I pursued that that idea in

41
00:01:49,469 --> 00:01:54,569
both undergraduate and graduate school

42
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:56,728
and when I was graduating with my PhD

43
00:01:54,569 --> 00:02:00,868
from West Virginia University last

44
00:01:56,728 --> 00:02:05,099
century I was looking into pursuing the

45
00:02:00,868 --> 00:02:07,409
idea of alternatives to synthetic to

46
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:09,179
protect plants and so I accepted a

47
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:11,430
postdoc at the New York State

48
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:13,890
Agricultural Experiment Station which is

49
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:16,740
governed by Cornell University so I

50
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:20,699
to work at Cornell University in upstate

51
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:23,879
New York in their field areas working

52
00:02:20,699 --> 00:02:28,289
with different microbes mostly fungi

53
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:30,689
that attack hosts to see if they had

54
00:02:28,289 --> 00:02:34,769
applicability to commercial agriculture

55
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:37,020
and so again back last century in the

56
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:41,280
late 80s to mid 90s I worked at Cornell

57
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:43,010
in the area of biological control and we

58
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,620
developed some pretty interesting

59
00:02:43,009 --> 00:02:50,250
microbes that a decision was made back

60
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:53,039
in the mid 90s to leave Cornell and help

61
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:55,770
start a company that we now call today

62
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:58,709
bio work so got about 25 plus years of

63
00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:02,550
experience actually out there promoting

64
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:04,170
and placing biologicals into commercial

65
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:08,400
horticulture agriculture and now the

66
00:03:04,169 --> 00:03:11,309
medicinal plant market yeah I'm very

67
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,959
familiar with your company we actually a

68
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:14,819
lot of the growers that we work with are

69
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,699
using a lot of your products I think you

70
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:19,229
guys do a great job and I want to circle

71
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:21,389
back to some of the products that might

72
00:03:19,229 --> 00:03:24,149
be best for for cannabis here in a

73
00:03:21,389 --> 00:03:26,599
little bit but before we do I kind of

74
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:30,810
wanted to talk a little bit about

75
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:32,909
trichoderma and mycorrhizal fungus and I

76
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:36,180
know that one of the things that you and

77
00:03:32,909 --> 00:03:41,009
I talked about off air last week was

78
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:42,750
just best practices and some of the the

79
00:03:41,009 --> 00:03:44,729
differentiation between different

80
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:46,709
strains of Trichoderma so could you just

81
00:03:44,729 --> 00:03:48,119
kind of talk about what is Trichoderma

82
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:50,159
and what is what are some of the best

83
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:55,830
practices from an agricultural

84
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:58,409
perspective Trichoderma is is a genus

85
00:03:55,830 --> 00:04:02,790
filamentous fungi

86
00:03:58,409 --> 00:04:05,370
found in the soil that has evolved for a

87
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:08,519
purpose of suppressing or possibly

88
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:10,739
protecting plants against pathogens and

89
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:13,289
all 12 more upon that in just a few

90
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:16,560
minutes but user filamentous fungi that

91
00:04:13,289 --> 00:04:21,180
are found in just about all types from

92
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:23,509
around the world and their role is to do

93
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:27,060
one of various functions within the soil

94
00:04:23,509 --> 00:04:29,459
some of them may just

95
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:31,699
grow throughout the soil taking up space

96
00:04:29,459 --> 00:04:34,500
others may grow throughout the soil

97
00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:39,839
producing metabolites that may be both

98
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:42,000
beneficial or harmful to both the plants

99
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:44,159
and other microbes in the soil still

100
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,879
they're very diverse these these tractor

101
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,570
dimmers there

102
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:50,610
the name Trichoderma is very familiar in

103
00:04:48,569 --> 00:04:53,310
the growing of plants because there's

104
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:55,949
been a lot of publications for a number

105
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:58,560
of decades on track and Irma's and

106
00:04:55,949 --> 00:05:00,689
they've been isolated from suppress the

107
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,449
soil soils that seem to have suppression

108
00:05:00,689 --> 00:05:05,519
certain pathogens scientists have went

109
00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:07,529
out and dug up different strains of

110
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:09,959
track and urban different species and

111
00:05:07,529 --> 00:05:12,750
have been able to identify some that you

112
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:17,009
know have the ability to help plants not

113
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:19,490
hurt them so what I'm hearing from you

114
00:05:17,009 --> 00:05:23,639
is that when we're talking about

115
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:26,100
trichoderma it's it's a numerous species

116
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:28,110
of fungi and so we actually have to be

117
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:30,540
very specific when we're looking at a

118
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:35,729
particular product or talking about a

119
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:37,169
particular trichoderma and I know I know

120
00:05:35,728 --> 00:05:39,209
one product you guys carry is called

121
00:05:37,168 --> 00:05:42,240
root shield can you talk a little bit

122
00:05:39,209 --> 00:05:45,930
about how that product came about and

123
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:48,150
what that particular strain is is it is

124
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:51,329
it strain or species with fungus I've

125
00:05:48,149 --> 00:05:52,589
always thought of it as a species but I

126
00:05:51,329 --> 00:05:54,909
want to make sure I'm using the right

127
00:05:52,589 --> 00:05:58,479
nomenclature

128
00:05:54,910 --> 00:06:03,400
try to dermis brains Trichoderma strains

129
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:05,680
are like different family members some

130
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:07,810
are really strong and good and some can

131
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:11,590
be a little bit naughty so depends upon

132
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:13,629
the strain of praça derma how strong or

133
00:06:11,589 --> 00:06:16,269
how weak or what they can do of any

134
00:06:13,629 --> 00:06:19,240
value or have no value at all because

135
00:06:16,269 --> 00:06:21,909
the the group the genus Trichoderma

136
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:25,000
they're known for their abilities to be

137
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:27,340
found in soils around the world and

138
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,410
they're workhorses out in the soil but

139
00:06:27,339 --> 00:06:31,479
again sometimes they do good things and

140
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:34,090
sometimes not so good so if they are

141
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:38,310
very strain dependent and we took that

142
00:06:34,089 --> 00:06:41,739
concept to heart at Cornell University

143
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:46,329
when we obtained a grant we were looking

144
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:50,620
at can you produce a hybrid strain of

145
00:06:46,329 --> 00:06:53,319
attractive derma that may be able to be

146
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:57,189
used as a bio control agent in a

147
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:59,019
commercial agricultural use so with this

148
00:06:57,189 --> 00:07:01,839
grant at Cornell and the lab of dr.

149
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:05,500
ferry Harman hybridization studies were

150
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:08,859
conducted now these are asexual fungi so

151
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:12,009
protoplast fusion was used to mimic what

152
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:16,030
happens out in nature to produce genetic

153
00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:19,469
variability and so strains were selected

154
00:07:16,029 --> 00:07:22,599
from various areas in the US where

155
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:24,720
disease suppressive soils have been

156
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:29,170
identified and what I mean by that is

157
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:31,930
farmers report record yields high yields

158
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:34,270
in their soils but their neighbor across

159
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:37,480
the street using the same inputs the

160
00:07:34,269 --> 00:07:39,759
same genetics inputs having the same

161
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:42,759
basic soil profile did not have the same

162
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,230
success and scientists will go out and

163
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:46,209
collect samples from these different

164
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:48,100
soil types and try to identify something

165
00:07:46,209 --> 00:07:51,099
that may be unique in these suppressive

166
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:52,810
soils and that was done and a couple of

167
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:55,780
different strains were identified from

168
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:58,209
suppressive soils hybrids were made

169
00:07:55,779 --> 00:08:00,219
using a process called proto Pass fusion

170
00:07:58,209 --> 00:08:03,219
and then time was spent to look at these

171
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:05,740
different hybrid strains to see if uh

172
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:09,330
the superior hybrid could be identified

173
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:12,610
that may have commercial attributes

174
00:08:09,329 --> 00:08:17,579
so that's where the field came from the

175
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:20,860
the t22 strain that you yea manufacture

176
00:08:17,579 --> 00:08:24,930
yeah that the actual numbered p22 of the

177
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:26,280
strain its string number is called 12

178
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:30,850
19-22

179
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:35,500
strain 12 was in red line was was fused

180
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:37,450
to string 95 and many many different

181
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:40,090
hybrids were isolated dozens and dozens

182
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:42,580
and dozens over a hundred and it was the

183
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:44,560
22nd hybrid so isolated to the

184
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:46,270
microscope when we took it for further

185
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:49,239
testing had the bear the greatest

186
00:08:46,269 --> 00:08:52,600
attributes to attack the greatest range

187
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:57,129
of pathogens it would grow on the entire

188
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:59,769
root system it would grow in soil pH

189
00:08:57,129 --> 00:09:02,649
soil temperature soil moistures that

190
00:08:59,769 --> 00:09:05,799
were highly variable so this strain had

191
00:09:02,649 --> 00:09:07,389
attributes that made it pretty strong

192
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:09,039
out there in the environment against a

193
00:09:07,389 --> 00:09:12,279
range of issues in a variety of

194
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:14,139
environments and because the parents

195
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:16,149
were chosen from suppressive soils were

196
00:09:14,139 --> 00:09:18,100
synthetics were used the strain had a

197
00:09:16,149 --> 00:09:19,899
high degree of compatibility many

198
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:22,629
chemical fungus I didn't develop

199
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:24,490
resistance and so this is the original

200
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:28,899
strain or active ingredient in our

201
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:31,360
product root shield but being scientists

202
00:09:28,899 --> 00:09:33,970
you always look for what else is out

203
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,759
there that can help being businessmen

204
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:38,259
you you always want to have something

205
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:40,629
interesting to talk about you always

206
00:09:38,259 --> 00:09:43,120
want to try to improve your products to

207
00:09:40,629 --> 00:09:44,409
offer more efficacy to the farmers and

208
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:48,399
the growers out there in the real world

209
00:09:44,409 --> 00:09:50,529
and so we had some single line isolate

210
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:53,500
strains that were pretty strong and had

211
00:09:50,529 --> 00:09:56,279
attributes in excess of what the hybrid

212
00:09:53,500 --> 00:10:00,100
strain t22 had one of these strains was

213
00:09:56,279 --> 00:10:03,189
classified as g41 it was attractive

214
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:07,029
derma viren's and it had the ability to

215
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:09,880
grow in very wet soils and it like to

216
00:10:07,029 --> 00:10:12,220
attack pathogens found in the group on

217
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:16,350
the oh oh my seats including pet diamond

218
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:20,470
Phytophthora and downy mildew so visa

219
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:21,699
that this other strain was mixed with

220
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:23,859
the t20

221
00:10:21,698 --> 00:10:25,748
two hybrid strategy 41 strain and we

222
00:10:23,859 --> 00:10:29,589
introduced a product a couple years ago

223
00:10:25,749 --> 00:10:31,058
called root shield plus the name root

224
00:10:29,589 --> 00:10:33,129
shield was pretty good the name root

225
00:10:31,058 --> 00:10:36,608
chill plus we thought we'd keep it so

226
00:10:33,129 --> 00:10:39,459
you now have two different strains in

227
00:10:36,609 --> 00:10:41,319
the same package and and and they

228
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:46,539
complement each other and in fact we

229
00:10:41,318 --> 00:10:48,248
were granted a patent on the synergy

230
00:10:46,539 --> 00:10:50,349
between these two strings which means

231
00:10:48,249 --> 00:10:54,480
they act better together than either one

232
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:58,569
would alone they're a heck of a couple

233
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:02,558
yeah so you mentioned some effects

234
00:10:58,568 --> 00:11:05,498
against oh my SETI's which I'm not great

235
00:11:02,558 --> 00:11:07,719
at pronouncing either what are some of

236
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:09,489
the attributes of these particular

237
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:13,689
strains in terms of the root shield Plus

238
00:11:09,489 --> 00:11:16,959
that people in cannabis may see benefit

239
00:11:13,688 --> 00:11:18,578
from you mentioned downy mildew for

240
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:21,219
example and I want to talk about the

241
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:24,008
mildews later in the podcast what are

242
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:26,109
just some some general attributes

243
00:11:24,009 --> 00:11:29,949
associated that you found from these

244
00:11:26,109 --> 00:11:33,429
particular strains well these strains

245
00:11:29,948 --> 00:11:36,548
are what we call rhizosphere Raizel

246
00:11:33,428 --> 00:11:39,458
plane competent they like to grow not

247
00:11:36,548 --> 00:11:40,899
just in the soil not just near the roots

248
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:42,578
but they grab onto the roots and

249
00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:45,788
actually coil around them most

250
00:11:42,578 --> 00:11:47,558
importantly root hairs so when we use

251
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:50,980
the name root shield we're truly talking

252
00:11:47,558 --> 00:11:53,188
about shielding the roots blocking

253
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:55,959
entrance in the root tissue by pathogens

254
00:11:53,188 --> 00:11:59,618
so that's one of their strong attributes

255
00:11:55,958 --> 00:12:02,528
they cling on very tightly and so you

256
00:11:59,619 --> 00:12:05,918
know if you're growing clones either

257
00:12:02,528 --> 00:12:07,629
from cuttings or seeds you know you want

258
00:12:05,918 --> 00:12:10,808
to protect that newly emerging root

259
00:12:07,629 --> 00:12:13,389
tissue and these trichotomous found the

260
00:12:10,808 --> 00:12:15,488
roots your plus will do that we have a

261
00:12:13,389 --> 00:12:17,438
wet amol powder you can drench with we

262
00:12:15,489 --> 00:12:19,239
have a granular you can incorporate or

263
00:12:17,438 --> 00:12:24,038
even topdressing water down because they

264
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:26,559
grow so these are little microbes fungi

265
00:12:24,038 --> 00:12:29,139
that will colonize and protect that root

266
00:12:26,558 --> 00:12:32,499
and that's a pretty good thing shielding

267
00:12:29,139 --> 00:12:34,240
it in addition these fungi produce

268
00:12:32,499 --> 00:12:38,350
enzymes

269
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:41,499
the the t22 string produces an abundance

270
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:43,600
of what we call chitin aces and many of

271
00:12:41,499 --> 00:12:45,730
your fungal pathogens that try to attack

272
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:49,678
the roots contain chitin as a sugar

273
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:52,720
moiety in the cell wall other pathogens

274
00:12:49,678 --> 00:12:55,328
do not contain as much chitin in the

275
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,459
cell wall they contain a sugar moiety

276
00:12:55,328 --> 00:12:59,019
called a glue can and I don't want to

277
00:12:57,458 --> 00:13:00,248
bore your audience with the chemical

278
00:12:59,019 --> 00:13:02,860
structures but they're close but a

279
00:13:00,249 --> 00:13:06,519
little bit different a little different

280
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:11,169
spin on a glucose molecule and this glue

281
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:13,928
can we have that additional strain the

282
00:13:11,169 --> 00:13:16,928
g-41 that produces an abundance of glue

283
00:13:13,928 --> 00:13:19,149
kinases so it attacks different

284
00:13:16,928 --> 00:13:21,458
pathogens by dissolving the cell wall

285
00:13:19,149 --> 00:13:24,490
and feeding on it than the t22 string so

286
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:26,859
together they produce these enzymes

287
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:29,558
these chitin aces and glue kinases that

288
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:32,199
will attack the sugar moieties and most

289
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:34,509
fungal cell wall so these these tractor

290
00:13:32,198 --> 00:13:37,208
nerman is not just cling to the roots

291
00:13:34,509 --> 00:13:40,419
but they'll actually attack pathogens

292
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:43,239
that get near the roots and stop them

293
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:49,028
from entering root tissue and in fact we

294
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:51,278
have seen studies on fungi that produced

295
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:56,220
survival structures called sclerotia

296
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:59,980
Sclerotinia is one and our friend

297
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:03,369
powdery mildew produces sclerotia and

298
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:06,459
these these excuse me boat rightists

299
00:14:03,369 --> 00:14:08,559
produces sclerotia my point is these

300
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:10,328
fungal pathogens produce survival

301
00:14:08,558 --> 00:14:13,240
structures in the soil that allow them

302
00:14:10,328 --> 00:14:15,039
to hide from synthetic chemistry's with

303
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,778
the tract of dermis can sense where they

304
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:18,879
are they'll grow to them rapid random

305
00:14:16,778 --> 00:14:21,970
and start to digest and feed upon him

306
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:24,699
so these Trichoderma fennel root co+ can

307
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:26,740
can lower pathogen levels in the soil

308
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:29,229
and that can be advantageous because if

309
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:30,850
you attack pathogens especially are

310
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:32,589
those that may grow out of the soil and

311
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:34,928
attack the foliage if you suppress them

312
00:14:32,589 --> 00:14:37,660
in the ground you'll have less potential

313
00:14:34,928 --> 00:14:39,669
when they surface out of the ground to

314
00:14:37,659 --> 00:14:44,289
possibly attack the foliage and flower

315
00:14:39,669 --> 00:14:47,860
buds yeah now in a healthy ecosystem are

316
00:14:44,289 --> 00:14:49,629
you seeing persistence with these

317
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:51,639
Trichoderma extreme Trichoderma strains

318
00:14:49,629 --> 00:14:53,828
are they lasting or is this something

319
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:55,679
that needs to be applied on a fairly

320
00:14:53,828 --> 00:14:57,699
regular schedule if you're doing

321
00:14:55,679 --> 00:15:01,328
intensive cropping like you would be

322
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:02,890
with cannabis well I know out there

323
00:15:01,328 --> 00:15:05,139
people listening would love to have

324
00:15:02,889 --> 00:15:07,389
something that lasts forever but the EPA

325
00:15:05,139 --> 00:15:09,069
says that's a no-no we mean we don't

326
00:15:07,389 --> 00:15:11,860
want to you to release something that's

327
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:13,510
invasive that will take over so what we

328
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:15,278
see with our tract determines is that no

329
00:15:13,509 --> 00:15:18,549
colonize the root tissue and a

330
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:21,278
protective level for 8 up to 12 weeks

331
00:15:18,549 --> 00:15:24,819
depending upon the organic level of the

332
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:27,389
growing media organic levels tend to

333
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:30,339
encourage these praça dermis to persist

334
00:15:27,389 --> 00:15:33,519
but after 12 weeks we see these levels

335
00:15:30,339 --> 00:15:35,529
begin to drop in by 16 weeks there's no

336
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,929
appreciable protection with these

337
00:15:35,528 --> 00:15:39,639
strings of trichoderma found in root

338
00:15:37,929 --> 00:15:42,088
shield Plus so it doesn't last forever

339
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:45,009
and the other interesting point is that

340
00:15:42,089 --> 00:15:49,390
they have compatibility we know with

341
00:15:45,009 --> 00:15:53,139
mycorrhizae dolly back in the 1980s late

342
00:15:49,389 --> 00:16:00,100
1980s and early 1990s we were doing work

343
00:15:53,139 --> 00:16:02,439
with the USDA dr. Bob Lumsden who was

344
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:05,170
able to show that our strains attracted

345
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:08,279
Burma had no negative effect or little

346
00:16:05,169 --> 00:16:10,899
or no negative effect on micro raisa and

347
00:16:08,278 --> 00:16:12,850
dr. Mary house back from Michigan State

348
00:16:10,899 --> 00:16:14,528
University also published it saw less

349
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:17,589
than a 10 percent or about a 10%

350
00:16:14,528 --> 00:16:19,208
reduction in micro Rosie concentration

351
00:16:17,589 --> 00:16:22,600
when I'm using these strains of private

352
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:24,578
area which is not significant so we

353
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,769
don't always know why they're compatible

354
00:16:24,578 --> 00:16:28,929
but when we place them together they

355
00:16:26,769 --> 00:16:30,549
they seem to not have a negative effect

356
00:16:28,929 --> 00:16:33,458
on each other so that's a good thing but

357
00:16:30,549 --> 00:16:35,198
I like to say that doesn't hold for all

358
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:37,208
the different strains and all the

359
00:16:35,198 --> 00:16:40,838
different species of crocodilian that

360
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:42,669
may be offered to you out there like I

361
00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:45,310
said a lot of these strains may produce

362
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:47,948
metabolites that are have a negative

363
00:16:45,309 --> 00:16:49,899
effect on plants or may have a negative

364
00:16:47,948 --> 00:16:51,578
effect on mycorrhizae that's why some

365
00:16:49,899 --> 00:16:53,649
people say you can mix trichoderma

366
00:16:51,578 --> 00:16:56,169
mycorrhizae the others say I don't know

367
00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:58,958
others say you can't it depends on the

368
00:16:56,169 --> 00:17:01,029
strain and that's very important to

369
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:03,399
understand not all strains

370
00:17:01,029 --> 00:17:06,970
tracted Irma are the same not all humans

371
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:08,349
are the same so it's important to

372
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:09,100
understand the strain and ask the

373
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:12,009
questions

374
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:15,099
hey company do you know what your

375
00:17:12,009 --> 00:17:16,180
strains are compatible with I'm glad you

376
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:17,529
highlighted that because this is

377
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:21,160
something that you and I talked about

378
00:17:17,529 --> 00:17:22,960
last week as well off air and for me one

379
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:25,810
of the challenges I see is I see these

380
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:27,579
commercial products and you know I know

381
00:17:25,809 --> 00:17:30,369
here's one that I'm just looking at the

382
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:33,750
label it has 83 propagules per gram of

383
00:17:30,369 --> 00:17:41,079
Glomus and Terada sees it Globus ma CA

384
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:43,359
and then 313 313131 spam of trichoderma

385
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:45,129
so you have a preponderance of

386
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:47,859
trichoderma in there at concentrations

387
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:50,200
you know exponentially higher than the

388
00:17:47,859 --> 00:17:51,490
amount of micro rise in the product you

389
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,769
know even though the product is marketed

390
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:55,690
as a mycorrhizal product and you know

391
00:17:53,769 --> 00:17:56,889
the company claims that these things

392
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:59,860
play nice together

393
00:17:56,890 --> 00:18:01,509
but we don't really know you know it's

394
00:17:59,859 --> 00:18:04,779
an end user without seeing a lot of

395
00:18:01,509 --> 00:18:06,309
research to support it so I just want to

396
00:18:04,779 --> 00:18:09,220
caution listeners to do their homework

397
00:18:06,309 --> 00:18:10,720
and realize too what's on the label

398
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:12,240
isn't always what's actually in the

399
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,490
product - that's a whole nother

400
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,630
challenge that we're finding the Oregon

401
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:18,730
Department of Agriculture has been

402
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:20,530
testing a lot of products and finding

403
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:22,539
that with microbials you don't always

404
00:18:20,529 --> 00:18:25,470
get what you think you're getting when

405
00:18:22,539 --> 00:18:28,029
we're talking across the board here but

406
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:29,890
you know I have I have tried routes

407
00:18:28,029 --> 00:18:33,160
yield before I think I think you guys do

408
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:35,560
a great job with your products how does

409
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:38,950
that work in terms of shelf life with

410
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:40,029
the root shield and root shield Plus are

411
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:42,190
people able to walk into a store

412
00:18:40,029 --> 00:18:44,079
purchase it I know I ordered online and

413
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:45,700
had it shipped directly from you guys to

414
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:48,549
me and this was this is quite a few

415
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:50,470
years back but how does how to shelf

416
00:18:48,549 --> 00:18:52,750
life and those sorts of things stability

417
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:57,009
come into play with a microbial product

418
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:59,799
like this well just to make sure

419
00:18:57,009 --> 00:19:03,029
everybody can find this information on

420
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:09,669
their own please check out our website

421
00:19:03,029 --> 00:19:12,970
WWE have compatibility information shelf

422
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:15,670
life and storage information

423
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:18,190
if you want to treat ten plants or

424
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:22,060
10,000 acres we have small volume and

425
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:26,370
large volume calculations for you we

426
00:19:22,059 --> 00:19:30,099
have a very high quality expertise staff

427
00:19:26,369 --> 00:19:32,219
so ask the expert area on our websites

428
00:19:30,099 --> 00:19:36,519
and then your questions give us a call

429
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:38,710
we have a lot of PhDs we have under plus

430
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:40,420
years of expertise and experience with

431
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:42,819
some of the people we have on our

432
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:46,000
technical services and our biological

433
00:19:42,819 --> 00:19:47,859
program managers along with our people

434
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,769
like myself are biological solutions

435
00:19:47,859 --> 00:19:52,240
advisors we we throw a team effort of

436
00:19:50,769 --> 00:19:54,369
trying to give you an answer but to

437
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,980
answer your question quickly you know

438
00:19:54,369 --> 00:19:58,869
with our products it's temperature

439
00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:01,539
dependent most Trichoderma today are

440
00:19:58,869 --> 00:20:03,399
temperature dependent so if you stored

441
00:20:01,539 --> 00:20:06,009
at room temperature you can get six

442
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:08,380
months in the refrigerator

443
00:20:06,009 --> 00:20:10,839
you'll get longer in the freezer it

444
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:13,630
stores even longer so we have a shelf

445
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:15,429
life table based upon temperature can

446
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:18,360
you walk into a store and buy our

447
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:21,700
products there is a chance you can

448
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:24,369
however we typically try to direct

449
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:26,529
people through our distribution channel

450
00:20:24,369 --> 00:20:29,139
and again on our homepage

451
00:20:26,529 --> 00:20:30,609
if you click at the top or if you go to

452
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:32,650
the top there's a button where to buy

453
00:20:30,609 --> 00:20:34,929
into the state enter the country because

454
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:36,820
we're in multiple countries and you will

455
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:39,730
see a listing of our distributors and a

456
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:41,799
way to contact them so we try to do it

457
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:44,259
that way we do have a retail site we

458
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:46,779
have a couple of retail outlets

459
00:20:44,259 --> 00:20:49,059
Johnny's Lexi's barbacoa and others that

460
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:51,309
you can order from so we try to make it

461
00:20:49,059 --> 00:20:54,879
easy to get it from you or get it from

462
00:20:51,309 --> 00:20:57,369
us to get it to you we try to give you

463
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,200
shelf-life information tables that you

464
00:20:57,369 --> 00:21:01,979
can print off they're all PDFs we've got

465
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,910
compatibility with other biologicals

466
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:07,000
fertilizers agilent's and other

467
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:09,640
synthetic inputs I mean here are fungi

468
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,529
that you would expect not to be able to

469
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:14,200
be mixed with chemical fungicides but

470
00:21:11,529 --> 00:21:16,240
they can be there's many you can because

471
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:18,279
the premise behind biologicals roots

472
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,200
you'll + and anything else is you want

473
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:23,920
to prevent you don't want to try to cure

474
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:26,919
and in cannabis and him your toolboxes

475
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:29,980
are limited and what you have available

476
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:31,538
and so you want to prevent and not have

477
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:33,669
to go to that tool box for a hammer

478
00:21:31,538 --> 00:21:36,548
because you don't have a lot of hammers

479
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:39,220
but prevent and not only preventive from

480
00:21:36,548 --> 00:21:42,038
a root protective aspect or prevented it

481
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:44,048
from a foliar aspect you know things can

482
00:21:42,038 --> 00:21:45,999
get out of hand real fast above the

483
00:21:44,048 --> 00:21:48,009
ground and if you don't have some

484
00:21:45,999 --> 00:21:48,788
preventative out there you're gonna lose

485
00:21:48,009 --> 00:21:51,819
some plants

486
00:21:48,788 --> 00:21:53,858
you're gonna lose some flowers that's a

487
00:21:51,819 --> 00:21:55,689
good segue into the next part of our

488
00:21:53,858 --> 00:21:57,569
conversation but before we do I had one

489
00:21:55,690 --> 00:22:00,129
last question about Trichoderma

490
00:21:57,569 --> 00:22:02,519
specifically the ones that you are

491
00:22:00,128 --> 00:22:05,469
offering do those have offer any

492
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:06,878
assistance in regards to the microbial

493
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:09,220
loop or nutrient cycling

494
00:22:06,878 --> 00:22:14,398
in terms of plant health or plant growth

495
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:20,649
beyond the disease resistance potential

496
00:22:14,398 --> 00:22:23,758
how much time you got to that oh we

497
00:22:20,648 --> 00:22:26,979
published a paper at a station called

498
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:30,099
solubalization and sequestration of

499
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:34,378
inorganic nutrients by trichoderma

500
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:37,599
strength e22 don't ask me to say to you

501
00:22:34,378 --> 00:22:41,079
and they answer your question not just

502
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:44,428
hat just yes but heck yes these are try

503
00:22:41,079 --> 00:22:46,778
consumers have the ability to solubilize

504
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:50,288
insoluble nutrients we would take

505
00:22:46,778 --> 00:22:52,179
culture filtrate from strain teen 22 we

506
00:22:50,288 --> 00:22:54,069
put rock phosphate in it put it on a

507
00:22:52,179 --> 00:22:56,559
shaker over and I come back in the next

508
00:22:54,069 --> 00:22:59,230
day and it was gone somebody stole the

509
00:22:56,558 --> 00:23:01,739
rock no they didn't it was dissolved

510
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:04,538
because our track of nervous retreat

511
00:23:01,739 --> 00:23:06,940
produced reducing agent chelating agents

512
00:23:04,538 --> 00:23:10,148
they're part of the recycling of food

513
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:13,538
back to the root tissue in addition and

514
00:23:10,148 --> 00:23:15,638
this is a published paper in addition

515
00:23:13,538 --> 00:23:18,548
another paper was published out of the

516
00:23:15,638 --> 00:23:23,288
lab up from a scientist visiting from

517
00:23:18,548 --> 00:23:25,929
Taiwan again last century and they were

518
00:23:23,288 --> 00:23:28,658
able to show that utilizing our

519
00:23:25,929 --> 00:23:31,298
attractive derma strings as a soil

520
00:23:28,659 --> 00:23:36,249
drench that they could inhibit viral

521
00:23:31,298 --> 00:23:38,710
uptake by the plant tissue I got a paper

522
00:23:36,249 --> 00:23:40,779
in front of me right now I'm taking a

523
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:44,590
look at called practicer my heart

524
00:23:40,779 --> 00:23:47,889
t22 induces induces systemic resistance

525
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:51,279
in tomato infected by cucumber mosaic

526
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:53,200
virus we're seeing these tract of dermis

527
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:56,559
can turn on what's called induced

528
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:59,289
systemic resistance within that plant it

529
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:02,649
helps produce things like phyto alexinnz

530
00:23:59,289 --> 00:24:04,920
which are the antibodies of a plant it's

531
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:08,800
quite fascinating in fact we did a study

532
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:11,560
again a while ago at Texas A&amp;M on cotton

533
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:14,559
seedlings out of the strings and with

534
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:17,230
t22 we saw a tenfold increase in phyto

535
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:18,730
Alexan production in the roots and again

536
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:20,589
the plight of alexinnz are one of your

537
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:23,140
plant hormones that are produced as a

538
00:24:20,589 --> 00:24:25,480
response to a problem in infection there

539
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:28,690
the so called antibodies in a plant they

540
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:31,210
move from the roots up and so to answer

541
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:33,700
your question yes we there's a lot of

542
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:38,190
publications on this I if you would just

543
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:40,509
a search solubilization or or michael

544
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:42,549
parasitism or induced systemic

545
00:24:40,509 --> 00:24:44,019
resistance and t22 you're going to see a

546
00:24:42,549 --> 00:24:46,149
lot of papers popping out

547
00:24:44,019 --> 00:24:48,819
so there's a lot of publications we try

548
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:52,390
to make sure that we have data support

549
00:24:48,819 --> 00:24:54,879
what we say that's that's great that's I

550
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:56,890
love that I'm gonna put some links up on

551
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,760
the podcast page to your website as well

552
00:24:56,890 --> 00:25:02,470
as some of the publicly available papers

553
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:04,480
you and I can talk about that after the

554
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:06,759
podcast and we can put some of those up

555
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:09,700
and then I'm excited to put you in touch

556
00:25:06,759 --> 00:25:11,740
with dr. Ben Higgins to it and start

557
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:14,110
maybe doing some research on cannabis

558
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:16,089
here with some of these things because I

559
00:25:14,109 --> 00:25:19,599
think that's really exciting what you

560
00:25:16,089 --> 00:25:21,669
guys are doing - Jenna head we I've been

561
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:24,449
talking to scientists around the country

562
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:27,460
we want to set up studies to see how

563
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:30,400
metabolite production is enhanced

564
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:33,100
reduced altered using our inputs out we

565
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,480
look forward to having that data we look

566
00:25:33,099 --> 00:25:37,689
forward to those studies so please

567
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:41,710
anybody out there we want to work and

568
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:44,200
have data we we've strive for many many

569
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:47,680
decades to offer information so you

570
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:51,850
you're not guessing you're using facts

571
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:54,490
and figures to guide your programs

572
00:25:51,849 --> 00:25:56,230
yeah that's I totally agree with you on

573
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:57,309
that I think that's wonderful what you

574
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:59,500
guys are doing

575
00:25:57,309 --> 00:26:01,809
you had mentioned some of the

576
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:02,769
above-ground challenges which was

577
00:26:01,809 --> 00:26:04,299
something that I was really looking

578
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:07,509
forward to talking about with your

579
00:26:04,299 --> 00:26:11,409
background in pathology so one of the

580
00:26:07,509 --> 00:26:14,079
big challenges in cannabis is powdery

581
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:16,509
mildew can you talk a little about a bit

582
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:18,519
about what it is how it relates to

583
00:26:16,509 --> 00:26:22,960
cannabis and how we might be able to

584
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:26,019
better treat and prevent it well Padme

585
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:28,990
mildews uh it's tough I mean in a tax

586
00:26:26,019 --> 00:26:31,089
cannabis powdery mildew is just a

587
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:33,849
general name for many many different

588
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:36,009
genera that are included in the grouping

589
00:26:33,849 --> 00:26:38,319
powdery mildew thirty-plus and they're

590
00:26:36,009 --> 00:26:41,500
finding more all the time so it's a

591
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:43,679
pretty broad spectrum it typically

592
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:49,259
occurs on the upper leaf surface as a

593
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:54,130
white powdery kind of - little hairs and

594
00:26:49,259 --> 00:26:57,430
and so it's it's unique in that it's an

595
00:26:54,130 --> 00:27:01,320
obligate parasite so it likes living

596
00:26:57,430 --> 00:27:05,080
tissue to grow and develop it it's

597
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:07,659
unusual in that it doesn't require free

598
00:27:05,079 --> 00:27:10,059
moisture to germinate you know things

599
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:12,190
like Bo try this the free moisture -

600
00:27:10,059 --> 00:27:14,679
thank you go crazy quickly this thing

601
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:17,340
doesn't need free moisture you can

602
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:19,480
actually pull moisture out of

603
00:27:17,339 --> 00:27:22,779
atmospheric water we actually call

604
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:25,089
humidity so it can get out of hand

605
00:27:22,779 --> 00:27:29,259
it likes to thrive between temperatures

606
00:27:25,089 --> 00:27:31,589
of 60 to 72 if you can raise the

607
00:27:29,259 --> 00:27:34,660
temperature in your greenhouse or your

608
00:27:31,589 --> 00:27:37,809
atmospheric control unit to about 75 it

609
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:40,960
just doesn't thrive real well it's

610
00:27:37,809 --> 00:27:45,639
interesting in that powdery mildew needs

611
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:48,460
an open wound or a cut or a stoma -

612
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:50,410
inner leaf tissue it differs them you

613
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:51,910
know botrytis and downy in that they'll

614
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:53,950
make enzymes and dissolve their way

615
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:56,320
through the cuticle and the epidermis of

616
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:59,950
the leaf tissue powdery mildew really

617
00:27:56,319 --> 00:28:03,909
doesn't do that so you know you can use

618
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:04,920
certain products certain contact kill or

619
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:07,470
certain hammers

620
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:09,810
and some people will even say that's a

621
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:12,299
curative effect well powdery doesn't

622
00:28:09,809 --> 00:28:13,619
enter quickly so I don't know if its

623
00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:16,950
curative you just happen to whack it

624
00:28:13,619 --> 00:28:21,029
before it got into plant tissue so it's

625
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:23,190
a it's an interesting fungal problem to

626
00:28:21,029 --> 00:28:26,339
control it yeah just get the humidity

627
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:28,200
down get it down to 45 percent if you

628
00:28:26,339 --> 00:28:31,740
can I know that's pretty low but that

629
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:33,000
really discourages powdery mildew that

630
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:36,559
or get the temperature in your

631
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:40,049
greenhouse around 75 to discourage it

632
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:42,149
you know with any pathogen out there tad

633
00:28:40,049 --> 00:28:44,519
that may harm a plant it's always good

634
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:46,410
to find the best genetics available and

635
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:48,930
I know there's a bunch of work being

636
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:51,960
done in cannabis on genetics because

637
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:54,180
resistant varieties you know that's that

638
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:55,789
there's nothing that coating resistant

639
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:58,110
but more if you can lower pressure

640
00:28:55,789 --> 00:29:00,720
significantly than some of your contacts

641
00:28:58,109 --> 00:29:02,399
and biologicals may be all you'll ever

642
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,319
need to keep things from getting

643
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:08,370
seriously out of hand if you use them

644
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:12,059
preventative ly so it is a very common

645
00:29:08,369 --> 00:29:14,489
problem powdery mildew I mean Dolly the

646
00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:17,450
multiple generate can probably attack

647
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:22,980
over 1500 different types of plants so

648
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:25,380
it's a very common problem so I've a few

649
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:28,680
questions here let's start with the do I

650
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:30,570
need to worry about my the powdery

651
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:32,700
mildew on my comfrey or the powdery

652
00:29:30,569 --> 00:29:34,980
mildew on my squash infecting my

653
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:37,289
cannabis plant in my garden if I was say

654
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:41,700
in a greenhouse or outdoors or is there

655
00:29:37,289 --> 00:29:44,819
is there a specific species or strain

656
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:46,289
that's affecting cannabis that's that's

657
00:29:44,819 --> 00:29:49,589
different than what we're seeing on

658
00:29:46,289 --> 00:29:55,200
these other vegetables or other crops or

659
00:29:49,589 --> 00:29:56,579
do you know well sometimes they can jump

660
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,819
from one crop to the other it just

661
00:29:56,579 --> 00:30:02,579
depends upon the strain of the of the

662
00:29:59,819 --> 00:30:08,099
pathogen you know some of these

663
00:30:02,579 --> 00:30:11,039
pathogens are more crop specific some of

664
00:30:08,099 --> 00:30:12,779
them aren't so it's always best if you

665
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:16,440
if you got other plants in there with

666
00:30:12,779 --> 00:30:18,118
this powdery mildew it may not be a bad

667
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:21,328
idea that the tree

668
00:30:18,118 --> 00:30:26,908
those plants but again it just it just

669
00:30:21,328 --> 00:30:29,668
depends so what I see you know as

670
00:30:26,909 --> 00:30:32,189
someone who grows a fair number of

671
00:30:29,669 --> 00:30:34,799
vegetables with my squash and stuff when

672
00:30:32,189 --> 00:30:36,749
I start getting the colder nights I'll

673
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:38,818
get like I'll have like a really hot

674
00:30:36,749 --> 00:30:40,588
sunny day and then the next day it'll

675
00:30:38,818 --> 00:30:43,199
it'll rain or I'll have a really cold

676
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:45,448
night some sort of water event and then

677
00:30:43,199 --> 00:30:47,729
I'll start seeing powdered mildew a day

678
00:30:45,449 --> 00:30:49,259
or two later popping up and the spore

679
00:30:47,729 --> 00:30:52,588
pressure just seems to get really high

680
00:30:49,259 --> 00:30:54,469
and I can spray that that pumpkin plant

681
00:30:52,588 --> 00:30:57,628
or squash plant with an oil-based

682
00:30:54,469 --> 00:31:00,328
solution that will you know kill that

683
00:30:57,628 --> 00:31:02,308
powdery mildew but it doesn't it seems

684
00:31:00,328 --> 00:31:03,418
to just keep coming right back you know

685
00:31:02,308 --> 00:31:06,028
four or five days later

686
00:31:03,419 --> 00:31:07,829
I've got powdery mildew again and with

687
00:31:06,028 --> 00:31:10,618
cannabis I know you can't you can't

688
00:31:07,828 --> 00:31:11,818
spray a lot of stuff and flower I want

689
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:12,868
to talk a little more about the humidity

690
00:31:11,818 --> 00:31:15,328
and temperature thing but what are your

691
00:31:12,868 --> 00:31:19,558
thoughts in terms of treatments so when

692
00:31:15,328 --> 00:31:21,598
we're contact killing powdery mildew is

693
00:31:19,558 --> 00:31:24,178
it because of the spore pressure and the

694
00:31:21,598 --> 00:31:25,858
air that we're just seeing we're seeing

695
00:31:24,179 --> 00:31:27,989
more pop-up like do we need to control

696
00:31:25,858 --> 00:31:31,438
that or is the plant just damaged at

697
00:31:27,989 --> 00:31:33,449
that point it has easy access and it's

698
00:31:31,439 --> 00:31:37,019
just gonna keep coming back once we've

699
00:31:33,449 --> 00:31:39,989
seen it on a plant does that make sense

700
00:31:37,019 --> 00:31:41,628
pathogens pathogens are like the IRS

701
00:31:39,989 --> 00:31:44,159
they never go away

702
00:31:41,628 --> 00:31:46,558
they're always out there they're always

703
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:48,959
wanting to do something it just takes

704
00:31:46,558 --> 00:31:52,259
the right environmental trigger to turn

705
00:31:48,959 --> 00:31:56,578
them on and powdery mildews can survive

706
00:31:52,259 --> 00:32:00,378
up to three years in plant debris so you

707
00:31:56,578 --> 00:32:05,278
know they they they have persistence

708
00:32:00,378 --> 00:32:07,348
others can survive for decades but other

709
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:10,378
pathogens but battery mildew can survive

710
00:32:07,348 --> 00:32:12,298
in overwinter plant debris and survive a

711
00:32:10,378 --> 00:32:14,478
couple of winters up to three years in

712
00:32:12,298 --> 00:32:18,418
plant debris so it's always out there

713
00:32:14,479 --> 00:32:21,869
it's good to use as you said some of

714
00:32:18,419 --> 00:32:23,699
these contact hammers especially when

715
00:32:21,868 --> 00:32:25,708
the environment as you described starts

716
00:32:23,699 --> 00:32:27,899
to favor the occurrence because you know

717
00:32:25,709 --> 00:32:29,489
under certain environmental conditions

718
00:32:27,898 --> 00:32:30,619
and triggers a couple of days later it's

719
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:33,110
happening so

720
00:32:30,619 --> 00:32:35,359
that trigger hits let's get out to

721
00:32:33,109 --> 00:32:38,779
prevent it as you mentioned oils oils

722
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:40,969
are a great contact we have an oil I

723
00:32:38,779 --> 00:32:43,430
will mention it it's called self oil ex

724
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:45,890
the only reason I mention it that if

725
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:49,549
you've ever used an oil that looks like

726
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:52,910
milk that self Oil X it's an emulsified

727
00:32:49,549 --> 00:32:55,639
oil to give it charge so it will react

728
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:58,730
with water and it has some attributes

729
00:32:55,640 --> 00:33:01,820
from that aspect but other things you

730
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:04,610
can use besides oils for these foliar

731
00:33:01,819 --> 00:33:06,439
pathogens or soaps soaps can be

732
00:33:04,609 --> 00:33:09,558
effective but be careful

733
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:12,740
they can weaken the cuticle and do other

734
00:33:09,558 --> 00:33:15,190
things and then you have we have a salt

735
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:18,799
based chemistry called Mill stop it's a

736
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:22,549
potassium bicarbonate that will defecate

737
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:25,129
and not allow fungal spores to either

738
00:33:22,549 --> 00:33:28,190
germinate or grow very well because of

739
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:32,950
the desiccation properties and also the

740
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:35,360
pH alteration properties of this product

741
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:38,330
you know I've also done some experience

742
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:41,990
with there's an enzyme in milk raw milk

743
00:33:38,329 --> 00:33:43,990
apparently too that has some efficacy I

744
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:47,750
know that there's some specific

745
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:49,519
biological fungicides as well you know

746
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:52,160
products like actinovate but I haven't

747
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:53,660
had amazing success with like

748
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,080
streptomyces and some of those other

749
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:56,660
ones

750
00:33:54,079 --> 00:34:00,619
personally I don't want to say that they

751
00:33:56,660 --> 00:34:02,390
don't work but for me a lot of these

752
00:34:00,619 --> 00:34:04,549
other applications well the milk

753
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:06,530
shoot it dries and it looks like powdery

754
00:34:04,549 --> 00:34:11,898
mildew on your leaf surface which to me

755
00:34:06,529 --> 00:34:14,989
was it that was a deal-breaker but the

756
00:34:11,898 --> 00:34:17,329
oh the the streptomyces I felt like I

757
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:19,549
had to apply it like every few days like

758
00:34:17,329 --> 00:34:22,159
I wasn't getting very strong suppression

759
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:24,769
personally and this is anecdotal purely

760
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:26,628
anecdotal in my experience the oils all

761
00:34:24,769 --> 00:34:29,418
worked really well I haven't done

762
00:34:26,628 --> 00:34:32,628
anything with potassium bicarbonate but

763
00:34:29,418 --> 00:34:35,179
at the end of the day I find I'm still

764
00:34:32,628 --> 00:34:37,339
it's nothing completely wipes it out

765
00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:40,039
once I see it on a plant I feel like I'm

766
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:42,379
battling it until I crop have you had

767
00:34:40,039 --> 00:34:44,029
any success or any other experience with

768
00:34:42,378 --> 00:34:47,210
people having

769
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:48,830
or success with that and then if we're

770
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:51,800
cloning that plant what are the risks

771
00:34:48,829 --> 00:34:54,380
associated with besides let's just say

772
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:56,300
being a weak genetic line or poorly

773
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:58,250
resistant to powdery mildew are there

774
00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:00,350
any other risks of Rhian occu lating it

775
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:03,679
or bringing it back into our into our

776
00:35:00,349 --> 00:35:06,500
controlled environment yes there's

777
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:08,149
always risks when you take that's why on

778
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:11,300
your mother plants you should do your

779
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:13,039
best people sometimes think our mom's

780
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:15,230
fine I don't need to worry about her

781
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:17,929
well mom needs to be taken care of too

782
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:20,000
and so you know before taking settings

783
00:35:17,929 --> 00:35:21,829
that encourage people to put some some

784
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,489
one of these products down you know salt

785
00:35:21,829 --> 00:35:27,079
soaps oils and you mentioned

786
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:30,429
streptomyces dad have you ever made use

787
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:33,259
of products that contain a bacillus

788
00:35:30,429 --> 00:35:38,989
different species but Leppa sila

789
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:41,840
subtilis these bacteria had have you

790
00:35:38,989 --> 00:35:44,899
ever used a bacillus before I have there

791
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:46,610
was one I got from beasts from Wilbur

792
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:48,740
Ellis back in the day and I'm trying to

793
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:50,840
remember the name of it the commercial

794
00:35:48,739 --> 00:35:55,250
name maybe it'll come to me while we're

795
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:58,460
all shouting oh that was bacillus I'm a

796
00:35:55,250 --> 00:36:01,849
little liquify seeing or what heck

797
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:04,190
anyway I milk that product I'm trying to

798
00:36:01,849 --> 00:36:07,839
remember - sorry we're both having a I'm

799
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:10,789
having a senior moment you're just but

800
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:13,550
and and what I like to talk about is and

801
00:36:10,789 --> 00:36:17,119
I'll make mention now is I like that the

802
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:19,010
hammer residual concept I like to mix

803
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:21,230
these salt soaps and oils with a

804
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:23,870
biological that may have some residual

805
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:27,679
activity based upon its mechanism of

806
00:36:23,869 --> 00:36:30,619
action and so you know you are right

807
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:33,500
some of these you know hammers the oils

808
00:36:30,619 --> 00:36:35,210
Reuther and salts they they got to be

809
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:37,119
reapplied because they don't last a long

810
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:39,289
time that's a good thing or a bad thing

811
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:42,859
but they don't have a lot of residuals

812
00:36:39,289 --> 00:36:46,429
so why not mix it with something with a

813
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:49,309
residual and there's some Sbisa bacillus

814
00:36:46,429 --> 00:36:51,769
based products out there we happen to

815
00:36:49,309 --> 00:36:56,059
have one called fils it's a bacillus

816
00:36:51,769 --> 00:36:57,809
subtilis strength USP 713 for those of

817
00:36:56,059 --> 00:37:00,568
you that want to know that

818
00:36:57,809 --> 00:37:04,349
and compatibility got shelf-life info

819
00:37:00,568 --> 00:37:06,498
and these bacteria in general pad their

820
00:37:04,349 --> 00:37:10,829
their mechanism of action is to produce

821
00:37:06,498 --> 00:37:13,759
metabolites that we call them sometimes

822
00:37:10,829 --> 00:37:16,979
cyclic lipopeptides n' and

823
00:37:13,759 --> 00:37:19,670
biosurfactants sodaro for is there's all

824
00:37:16,978 --> 00:37:25,889
sorts of names but these metabolites

825
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:28,019
have the ability to make holes in cell

826
00:37:25,889 --> 00:37:30,748
walls and cell membranes and cells can

827
00:37:28,018 --> 00:37:33,389
bleed to that they can collapse and

828
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:35,248
those metabolites can have some reason

829
00:37:33,389 --> 00:37:40,348
that can have some residual activity on

830
00:37:35,248 --> 00:37:42,149
the foliage so you mix ah in a lot of

831
00:37:40,349 --> 00:37:45,180
our programs you'll see us recommend

832
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:46,499
mixing our bicarbonate mil stop which

833
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:48,719
will help spread and stick the

834
00:37:46,498 --> 00:37:51,118
metabolites with cease which hasn't but

835
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:53,999
tab like so you get a quick direct kill

836
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:57,028
on contact and then you get a residual

837
00:37:53,998 --> 00:37:59,879
activity from the metabolites fantasy so

838
00:37:57,028 --> 00:38:02,219
you know that's where you can start

839
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:04,259
putting these biologicals together in

840
00:38:02,219 --> 00:38:06,688
your programs for a quick kill and a

841
00:38:04,259 --> 00:38:10,619
residual activity so you don't have to

842
00:38:06,688 --> 00:38:12,509
come out so often so I looked up the

843
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:15,599
product it was it was called Sonata

844
00:38:12,509 --> 00:38:17,429
it's a bacillus band a Puma less I'm

845
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:22,109
turtle it I'm terrible

846
00:38:17,429 --> 00:38:24,920
Puma liver okay but one thing I wanted

847
00:38:22,108 --> 00:38:29,028
to jump back to you was regarding

848
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:33,269
powdery mildew and temperature and

849
00:38:29,028 --> 00:38:35,429
humidity so one of the one of the

850
00:38:33,268 --> 00:38:37,618
challenges you know traditionally people

851
00:38:35,429 --> 00:38:39,329
would would grow cannabis during the

852
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:41,849
flower cycle and just immediately drop

853
00:38:39,329 --> 00:38:44,309
the humidity down into the 40's for that

854
00:38:41,849 --> 00:38:47,278
very reason that you mentioned because

855
00:38:44,309 --> 00:38:49,890
the the molds and mildews just don't

856
00:38:47,278 --> 00:38:52,559
don't enjoy that level of humidity but I

857
00:38:49,889 --> 00:38:54,719
find what we found and again this is

858
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:58,289
this is still fairly anecdotal but by

859
00:38:54,719 --> 00:39:00,438
using you know a vapor pressure

860
00:38:58,289 --> 00:39:03,630
differential in raising the humidity

861
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:07,219
relative to the temperature the plant

862
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:10,410
seems to be more resistant to these

863
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:11,548
particular mildews than

864
00:39:10,409 --> 00:39:14,129
prior problems so we've had some

865
00:39:11,548 --> 00:39:15,809
cannabis growers that have rather than

866
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:17,068
you know their traditional dropping the

867
00:39:15,809 --> 00:39:19,200
community they've actually raised the

868
00:39:17,068 --> 00:39:21,929
humidity level in the rooms and raised

869
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:24,239
the temperature and by doing so they've

870
00:39:21,929 --> 00:39:25,679
been able to reduce the amount of

871
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:27,419
powdery mildew that they beans

872
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:30,690
they've seen expressed on the leaf on

873
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:32,309
the leaf tissue in cannabis I think

874
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:34,380
that's a great idea and I've seen people

875
00:39:32,309 --> 00:39:38,339
do that too here in Florida when I go

876
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:41,780
visit and elsewhere and yeah because as

877
00:39:38,338 --> 00:39:45,538
you raise the temperature the humidity

878
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:48,210
changes but the most important thing is

879
00:39:45,539 --> 00:39:50,039
about 75 were hired pattering just

880
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:52,949
doesn't like to grow well it just

881
00:39:50,039 --> 00:39:54,599
doesn't so raise it up a little bit even

882
00:39:52,949 --> 00:39:57,989
if the humidity goes up because the

883
00:39:54,599 --> 00:40:00,119
temperature is still not conducive for

884
00:39:57,989 --> 00:40:04,078
this problem to get out of hand and if

885
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:07,769
you remember the pathogen an insect and

886
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:09,240
pest triangle you need the host you need

887
00:40:07,769 --> 00:40:12,119
the problem and you need the right

888
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:13,709
environment and so raising that

889
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:16,650
temperature even if the humidity goes up

890
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:18,210
it's still okay because you're not going

891
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:20,160
to allow because of warmer temperatures

892
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:23,068
to power degree to get out of hand so

893
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:25,739
I've seen that work too I agree with you

894
00:40:23,068 --> 00:40:27,449
so we've been we've been starting with

895
00:40:25,739 --> 00:40:29,038
the higher humidity and then slowly

896
00:40:27,449 --> 00:40:33,118
tapering it down towards the end of

897
00:40:29,039 --> 00:40:35,460
flower to help prevent botrytis because

898
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:37,079
it seems like as the plant is starting

899
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:39,389
to senesce is we're getting later in the

900
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:42,420
crop cycle were more at risk for

901
00:40:39,389 --> 00:40:46,440
botrytis as the flowers are developing

902
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:48,690
and it seems that if we don't drop that

903
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:50,900
humidity towards the end of the cycle or

904
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:53,309
we're going to still have some botrytis

905
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:55,200
challenges what can you tell can you

906
00:40:53,309 --> 00:40:58,079
talk about botrytis and sort of how it

907
00:40:55,199 --> 00:40:59,308
relates to powdery mildew and some of

908
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:00,809
these other things because one of the

909
00:40:59,309 --> 00:41:02,789
issues here is we can't spray a lot of

910
00:41:00,809 --> 00:41:05,099
stuff on cannabis flowers in flowering

911
00:41:02,789 --> 00:41:07,230
cycles and even though microbials are

912
00:41:05,099 --> 00:41:08,940
really challenging because some states

913
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:11,849
are testing for microbials but they're

914
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:13,470
not differentiating between you know

915
00:41:11,849 --> 00:41:15,778
different different types you know

916
00:41:13,469 --> 00:41:17,308
gram-negative bacteria or all these

917
00:41:15,778 --> 00:41:20,068
different things just microbial biomass

918
00:41:17,309 --> 00:41:21,930
is all they're looking at and so there's

919
00:41:20,068 --> 00:41:22,369
a lot of challenges around testing that

920
00:41:21,929 --> 00:41:23,960
just

921
00:41:22,369 --> 00:41:25,819
from a legal perspective make it really

922
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:29,510
hard to treat these things if we don't

923
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:31,250
get ahead of them early on oh no

924
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:31,760
question about it two ads no question

925
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:34,280
about it

926
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:36,980
and they'll do a total microbial foam

927
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:39,350
fungi and mold and things and they've

928
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:41,570
made that's why you know with some of

929
00:41:39,349 --> 00:41:43,819
our microbial living products we

930
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:47,059
recommend stop applying you know before

931
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:48,680
you know harvest the flowers because our

932
00:41:47,059 --> 00:41:51,279
goal is to ultimately go to these

933
00:41:48,679 --> 00:41:55,129
testing labs and set up primers and

934
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:58,100
assays to allow distinction of what's is

935
00:41:55,130 --> 00:42:00,559
there so you can negate the use of some

936
00:41:58,099 --> 00:42:03,500
of these beneficial biologicals because

937
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:05,239
they are darn good tools that offer you

938
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:07,219
know nothing negative to the plants just

939
00:42:05,239 --> 00:42:10,009
all of my products have exempt from

940
00:42:07,219 --> 00:42:11,389
residue tolerance levels so you don't

941
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:13,310
have to worry about anything they

942
00:42:11,389 --> 00:42:15,949
produce as being toxic to you the

943
00:42:13,309 --> 00:42:17,420
environment or the plant all of my

944
00:42:15,949 --> 00:42:20,869
products have at least one formulation

945
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:23,210
organically certified I mean if you were

946
00:42:20,869 --> 00:42:26,000
growing something you could pick and eat

947
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:28,159
tomatoes and then apple we have zero

948
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,199
pre-harvest intervals with our products

949
00:42:28,159 --> 00:42:33,589
because they don't crews anything toxic

950
00:42:30,199 --> 00:42:36,049
but they're still testing going on to

951
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:38,200
look at total microbes so that's where

952
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:41,990
you may want to make use of some of your

953
00:42:38,199 --> 00:42:45,199
your nonliving biologicals some of these

954
00:42:41,989 --> 00:42:46,759
oils and salts and soaps you know before

955
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:48,980
the because what happens is when the

956
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:50,870
flower closes upping it's nice and dense

957
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:52,550
it holds moisture in there and that's

958
00:42:50,869 --> 00:42:55,369
where problems can get out of hand

959
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:57,380
inside that flower and I know you can't

960
00:42:55,369 --> 00:42:59,319
use vials so before it closes too tight

961
00:42:57,380 --> 00:43:02,090
maybe means one of these other inputs

962
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:05,870
that could be that could be helpful but

963
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:09,610
you know the thing with botrytis is it

964
00:43:05,869 --> 00:43:12,559
different from powdery mildew both Rytas

965
00:43:09,610 --> 00:43:16,490
needs free moisture to germinate so it

966
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:18,980
likes it when it's wet out so they'll

967
00:43:16,489 --> 00:43:20,179
try to you don't want to water plants at

968
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:22,369
the end of the day and leave them wet

969
00:43:20,179 --> 00:43:24,769
all night you'll have no try to popping

970
00:43:22,369 --> 00:43:26,839
up the next day you don't want to do

971
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:28,519
that so you want to you want to keep

972
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:30,230
your plants dry so I know people that

973
00:43:28,519 --> 00:43:32,829
have issues with botrytis will space

974
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:35,750
plants a little more so they can dry

975
00:43:32,829 --> 00:43:38,029
others will turn on fans they

976
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:41,239
drei plans now you don't want to do that

977
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:43,540
with both rightous because Petridis is

978
00:43:41,239 --> 00:43:47,179
dispersed by the wind

979
00:43:43,539 --> 00:43:49,219
so when but try to sporulate on the soil

980
00:43:47,179 --> 00:43:52,549
surface and you turn fans on all you're

981
00:43:49,219 --> 00:43:55,029
doing is spreading it so you got to be

982
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:58,130
careful with airflow and botrytis

983
00:43:55,030 --> 00:44:00,380
whereas airflow can help them powdery

984
00:43:58,130 --> 00:44:02,570
mildew and other issues it's not good to

985
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:05,210
have good airflow because it can cause

986
00:44:02,570 --> 00:44:07,820
spore dispersal with botrytis a booked

987
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:09,170
riders so they're just a little bit

988
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:11,660
different but try this will produce

989
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:13,610
chitin aces and lipases enzymes that

990
00:44:11,659 --> 00:44:15,589
allow it to penetrate right through the

991
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:19,370
leaf surface and not have to worry about

992
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:22,720
finding a an opening available to it so

993
00:44:19,369 --> 00:44:25,460
it's not a it's a tough one

994
00:44:22,719 --> 00:44:27,049
well practice is different from pottery

995
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:29,059
in that you know there's there's

996
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:32,500
multiple species but rightist is the

997
00:44:29,059 --> 00:44:34,820
genus name but there's multiple species

998
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:38,989
fortunately enough these species are

999
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:40,670
more host specific so as I mentioned

1000
00:44:38,989 --> 00:44:43,459
with your powdery mildew you got some

1001
00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:45,470
cucumbers or something near some some

1002
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:47,300
medicinal plants I wouldn't do that

1003
00:44:45,469 --> 00:44:49,399
there's a chance not always but there's

1004
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:52,250
a chance less of a chance with poke try

1005
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:55,519
this because they're more specific but

1006
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:56,409
you've got one certain species but try

1007
00:44:55,519 --> 00:44:59,809
to cinerea

1008
00:44:56,409 --> 00:45:01,339
and I got eleven years of college on tad

1009
00:44:59,809 --> 00:45:04,309
so I can pronounce these names pretty

1010
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:06,740
well I better be able to it's this book

1011
00:45:04,309 --> 00:45:08,420
try to cinerea you know it's a beggar

1012
00:45:06,739 --> 00:45:09,949
out there you're gonna tackle over 200

1013
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:12,800
different plants both monocots and

1014
00:45:09,949 --> 00:45:15,799
dicots so if it's a gnarly one and you

1015
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:18,110
you know you buy strawberries and you

1016
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:20,420
put them in your refrigerator right why

1017
00:45:18,110 --> 00:45:20,809
because I want to eat them in two three

1018
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:23,119
weeks

1019
00:45:20,809 --> 00:45:25,940
well you can't do that there's some

1020
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:29,809
something gray growing on that that's go

1021
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:32,329
try this we call it gray mold and you

1022
00:45:29,809 --> 00:45:34,880
know even the refrigerated temperatures

1023
00:45:32,329 --> 00:45:39,230
of 46 degrees Fahrenheit it can grow

1024
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:42,230
after time so it likes it cool it likes

1025
00:45:39,230 --> 00:45:44,059
it moist so it differs in powder you

1026
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:47,960
won't see powdery grow it in your fridge

1027
00:45:44,059 --> 00:45:49,880
I can't imagine so it's a little bit

1028
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:52,970
different but

1029
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:55,400
and on a good side boat ride it doesn't

1030
00:45:52,969 --> 00:45:56,869
survive for three years like powdery

1031
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:58,220
does but try to you know a couple of

1032
00:45:56,869 --> 00:46:00,710
weeks to a couple of months maybe a

1033
00:45:58,219 --> 00:46:04,309
little longer but it's and this is a

1034
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:06,380
neat one in but pritus is related to

1035
00:46:04,309 --> 00:46:08,480
Sclerotinia it's in the same family and

1036
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:11,059
they they form these survival structures

1037
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:13,010
in the soil and you know what corner we

1038
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:15,230
used to do studies looking at how well

1039
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:17,780
these sclerosis could be colonized by

1040
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:19,340
our different strains in rural plus and

1041
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:21,290
they did a pretty good job of growing on

1042
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:23,000
them and knocking them out so that's

1043
00:46:21,289 --> 00:46:25,789
where I talked about earlier to suppress

1044
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,619
the nature of these strains to suppress

1045
00:46:25,789 --> 00:46:31,730
pathogens in the soil before they can

1046
00:46:27,619 --> 00:46:34,150
service and do foliar damage so can you

1047
00:46:31,730 --> 00:46:37,099
explain to me sort of the the physical

1048
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:38,840
mechanisms associated with botrytis and

1049
00:46:37,099 --> 00:46:42,469
also you get yarn you touched on this

1050
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:45,110
lifecycle a little bit here can you sort

1051
00:46:42,469 --> 00:46:48,199
of explain how it survives and and

1052
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:52,160
exactly what it does to attacking the

1053
00:46:48,199 --> 00:46:54,849
plan well the survival structures are

1054
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:58,250
called sclerotia there's these little

1055
00:46:54,849 --> 00:47:01,880
they produce hi-c and other materials

1056
00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:06,019
that encapsulate the survival spores in

1057
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:09,490
this the surviving cells inside and and

1058
00:47:06,019 --> 00:47:12,320
when the right environment is is there

1059
00:47:09,489 --> 00:47:14,809
again it can be you know they thrive

1060
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:17,059
from about sixty to seventy-five degrees

1061
00:47:14,809 --> 00:47:20,179
Fahrenheit so they thrive it about the

1062
00:47:17,059 --> 00:47:21,920
russain temperature ranges powdery but

1063
00:47:20,179 --> 00:47:24,169
they can survive in much cooler

1064
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:27,590
environments and again you get enough

1065
00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:30,110
moisture a good rain and you got these

1066
00:47:27,590 --> 00:47:33,530
temperatures in the soil they're going

1067
00:47:30,110 --> 00:47:36,079
to come out of hiding they're gonna grow

1068
00:47:33,530 --> 00:47:37,910
to the soil surface the boat Rytas is

1069
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:38,269
going to sporulate the spore is going to

1070
00:47:37,909 --> 00:47:41,329
be

1071
00:47:38,269 --> 00:47:44,090
windblown and that's how they move

1072
00:47:41,329 --> 00:47:49,369
around and in their in the environment

1073
00:47:44,090 --> 00:47:52,550
but krytus also as I mentioned will go

1074
00:47:49,369 --> 00:47:54,969
directly through the cuticle through the

1075
00:47:52,550 --> 00:47:57,289
epidermis into the the plant tissue but

1076
00:47:54,969 --> 00:48:00,259
especially but try to cinerea they

1077
00:47:57,289 --> 00:48:02,449
actually produce small RNA molecules

1078
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:03,559
that can affect the plants immune system

1079
00:48:02,449 --> 00:48:05,389
so

1080
00:48:03,559 --> 00:48:07,609
some of these pathogens when they attack

1081
00:48:05,389 --> 00:48:10,938
they'll turn the plants defense system

1082
00:48:07,608 --> 00:48:15,498
off and they have free reign at that

1083
00:48:10,938 --> 00:48:18,588
time so did I did I answer the questions

1084
00:48:15,498 --> 00:48:22,278
had like you yeah so I've seen botrytis

1085
00:48:18,588 --> 00:48:24,469
spread really quickly like oh yeah

1086
00:48:22,278 --> 00:48:26,478
takeaway Twitter and I've seen people

1087
00:48:24,469 --> 00:48:28,458
attempt to treat it in a variety of ways

1088
00:48:26,478 --> 00:48:30,169
from everything from hydrogen peroxide

1089
00:48:28,458 --> 00:48:32,778
to cutting off and wounding that

1090
00:48:30,170 --> 00:48:35,088
particular bud and taking it away from

1091
00:48:32,778 --> 00:48:36,528
the room but at the end of the day they

1092
00:48:35,088 --> 00:48:38,208
all feel like losing battles

1093
00:48:36,528 --> 00:48:40,838
once you've spotted it you're kind of

1094
00:48:38,208 --> 00:48:44,149
you're kind of in trouble it seems like

1095
00:48:40,838 --> 00:48:47,420
what would be the best way to address it

1096
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:49,278
and how quickly can it really spread it

1097
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:51,588
seems like it just it spreads like

1098
00:48:49,278 --> 00:48:54,318
wildfire in my experience once it's

1099
00:48:51,588 --> 00:48:57,380
established in a room but can you touch

1100
00:48:54,318 --> 00:48:59,659
on those those things a little bit yeah

1101
00:48:57,380 --> 00:49:01,369
I mean if you got free moisture in the

1102
00:48:59,659 --> 00:49:04,728
right temperature the right environment

1103
00:49:01,369 --> 00:49:08,028
in eight hours it can germinate in eight

1104
00:49:04,728 --> 00:49:10,248
to twelve hours so in half a day you got

1105
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:12,619
the right conditions it's germinating

1106
00:49:10,248 --> 00:49:14,748
it's growing and it's producing enzymes

1107
00:49:12,619 --> 00:49:18,259
going right inside the the leaf tissue

1108
00:49:14,748 --> 00:49:20,838
so if you can't get it with contacts so

1109
00:49:18,259 --> 00:49:23,509
that's why when you you either have a

1110
00:49:20,838 --> 00:49:24,858
history or you start to see a few plants

1111
00:49:23,509 --> 00:49:27,139
having issues that's when you got a

1112
00:49:24,858 --> 00:49:30,139
quarantine that problem and it with some

1113
00:49:27,139 --> 00:49:33,798
some contacts also there are some

1114
00:49:30,139 --> 00:49:35,449
biologicals that are available again mix

1115
00:49:33,798 --> 00:49:37,309
some of these hammers these salt soaps

1116
00:49:35,449 --> 00:49:40,338
and oils with something living again our

1117
00:49:37,309 --> 00:49:43,819
C's product is helpful but we brought in

1118
00:49:40,338 --> 00:49:46,188
a new fungus from New Zealand Australia

1119
00:49:43,818 --> 00:49:49,938
Regent at a couple of years ago and

1120
00:49:46,188 --> 00:49:53,028
started testing it it's a unique

1121
00:49:49,938 --> 00:49:56,318
biological and that most biologicals

1122
00:49:53,028 --> 00:50:00,139
either attacked a host or produce

1123
00:49:56,318 --> 00:50:06,829
metabolites that are detrimental to the

1124
00:50:00,139 --> 00:50:09,558
target or other things this this fungus

1125
00:50:06,829 --> 00:50:13,219
in its technique called ulocal a diem

1126
00:50:09,559 --> 00:50:16,039
odo Montse strain you three because the

1127
00:50:13,219 --> 00:50:17,119
name u2 was taken and this particular

1128
00:50:16,039 --> 00:50:20,380
strain

1129
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:26,900
of fungus is called technically an

1130
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:28,789
antagonist so when cells semester die

1131
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:31,880
they rupture and they release moisture

1132
00:50:28,789 --> 00:50:34,880
nutrients and pathogens and insects can

1133
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:38,420
since sometimes these volatile in and

1134
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:39,079
move or grow towards these compromised

1135
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:41,930
cells

1136
00:50:39,079 --> 00:50:44,450
well this fungus will actually grow on

1137
00:50:41,929 --> 00:50:46,699
those compromised cells this this

1138
00:50:44,449 --> 00:50:48,439
product and we're talking about

1139
00:50:46,699 --> 00:50:50,629
controlling both rightists and our

1140
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:54,230
parking is called bo tree stop so I

1141
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:56,720
think you know what it controls into its

1142
00:50:54,230 --> 00:50:59,150
an antagonist that outcompetes Mik

1143
00:50:56,719 --> 00:51:01,480
occupation of ruptured cells so as a

1144
00:50:59,150 --> 00:51:04,789
preventive or as a quarantined

1145
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:06,769
preventive you spray this out on the

1146
00:51:04,789 --> 00:51:11,450
foliage and it will call and ice and

1147
00:51:06,768 --> 00:51:13,368
grow however too close to harvest it may

1148
00:51:11,449 --> 00:51:15,739
continue to grow so we tell people and

1149
00:51:13,369 --> 00:51:18,740
again we have programs for cannabis

1150
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:21,258
production on our website called bio

1151
00:51:18,739 --> 00:51:23,118
works cannabis program and you'll read

1152
00:51:21,259 --> 00:51:25,248
about when we tell you to stop applying

1153
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:27,650
these microbes based upon microbial

1154
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:31,368
testing that's being done but this is a

1155
00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:35,989
real good tool in the toolbox to control

1156
00:51:31,369 --> 00:51:39,999
both Rytas and other foliar issues by

1157
00:51:35,989 --> 00:51:44,389
sheer competition for niche occupation

1158
00:51:39,998 --> 00:51:48,679
so once we have once I spot botrytis on

1159
00:51:44,389 --> 00:51:50,449
a on a bud in a room can I safely assume

1160
00:51:48,679 --> 00:51:53,028
that the spore pressure in that room is

1161
00:51:50,449 --> 00:51:56,598
is already fairly high or can i

1162
00:51:53,028 --> 00:51:59,268
potentially catch it early enough and

1163
00:51:56,599 --> 00:52:00,950
just remove see when you remove the bud

1164
00:51:59,268 --> 00:52:02,988
you're wounding the plant and I guess

1165
00:52:00,949 --> 00:52:06,048
creating potentially other issues you

1166
00:52:02,989 --> 00:52:09,739
know another place for pathogen and

1167
00:52:06,048 --> 00:52:12,159
disease but what what do you think I

1168
00:52:09,739 --> 00:52:15,940
mean for people who can't apply

1169
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:18,768
microbials and can't harvest immediately

1170
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:23,829
what other options really are there if

1171
00:52:18,768 --> 00:52:23,828
any for you know preserving your crop

1172
00:52:24,190 --> 00:52:28,909
depends on I've been in facilities no

1173
00:52:27,318 --> 00:52:30,739
names but I've been in there where I saw

1174
00:52:28,909 --> 00:52:32,539
a little bit of

1175
00:52:30,739 --> 00:52:34,669
boat ride is starting to creep up and

1176
00:52:32,539 --> 00:52:36,829
they cut it out and had no issues with

1177
00:52:34,670 --> 00:52:39,190
that plant you know sometimes people

1178
00:52:36,829 --> 00:52:42,949
will come back with some of these

1179
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:44,900
contact materials to help protect that

1180
00:52:42,949 --> 00:52:50,299
wound kind of like a temporary band-aid

1181
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:53,090
that can be done I like to tell people

1182
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:55,430
if you can and it's small enough try to

1183
00:52:53,090 --> 00:52:58,130
cut it out if it's getting out of hand

1184
00:52:55,429 --> 00:52:59,779
remove it didn't ask yourself do I have

1185
00:52:58,130 --> 00:53:01,820
a lot of air circulation here in this

1186
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:03,530
room if I do and the problem is about

1187
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:06,530
try this I may have spread spores I

1188
00:53:03,530 --> 00:53:09,890
better get out with some sort of contact

1189
00:53:06,530 --> 00:53:11,630
preventative and again salt soaps and

1190
00:53:09,889 --> 00:53:15,829
oil I don't know but I think they'd be

1191
00:53:11,630 --> 00:53:18,559
tough to detect and testing for for you

1192
00:53:15,829 --> 00:53:19,460
know I just don't I think they would be

1193
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:22,489
okay again

1194
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:24,110
I we're trying to as a company work

1195
00:53:22,489 --> 00:53:26,719
closer with some of these testing labs

1196
00:53:24,110 --> 00:53:28,670
to be able to give you a clearer answer

1197
00:53:26,719 --> 00:53:30,618
on when these things can be applied

1198
00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:34,369
when's the last time they should be

1199
00:53:30,619 --> 00:53:36,920
applied so again I know you're gonna

1200
00:53:34,369 --> 00:53:38,750
damage our maybe hurt a plant by

1201
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:41,000
trimming it but if you can trim it a

1202
00:53:38,750 --> 00:53:43,480
little bit maybe come in with something

1203
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:46,639
to protect out like an oil that wound

1204
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:49,070
you could save that plant but it's

1205
00:53:46,639 --> 00:53:52,219
scouting that tea answer tag to

1206
00:53:49,070 --> 00:53:54,559
everything is scouting don't get lazy

1207
00:53:52,219 --> 00:53:56,689
get out and look at your plants and I

1208
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:58,279
know in cannabis there's a lot of people

1209
00:53:56,690 --> 00:54:01,400
out there and a lot of ice so your whole

1210
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:03,260
entire staff should be trained to go out

1211
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:07,340
and scout if they see something funny

1212
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:08,720
report it just don't ignore it so yeah

1213
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:10,970
and I want to highlight the important of

1214
00:54:08,719 --> 00:54:13,489
good genetics too I mean I've seen

1215
00:54:10,969 --> 00:54:15,679
plants covered in in botrytis and

1216
00:54:13,489 --> 00:54:18,259
powdery mildew next to plants that don't

1217
00:54:15,679 --> 00:54:21,440
even seem to care because they just have

1218
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:22,790
that innate resistance in them and you

1219
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:25,070
know some people they're like this is

1220
00:54:22,789 --> 00:54:27,079
just the best cultivar of cannabis I've

1221
00:54:25,070 --> 00:54:29,630
ever grown you know it's the one that

1222
00:54:27,079 --> 00:54:32,119
everyone wants at the end of the day if

1223
00:54:29,630 --> 00:54:33,710
if it gets botrytis every single time I

1224
00:54:32,119 --> 00:54:36,170
probably wouldn't grow it and a lot of

1225
00:54:33,710 --> 00:54:39,679
people get stuck in that world of sort

1226
00:54:36,170 --> 00:54:41,780
of that market need to grow something

1227
00:54:39,679 --> 00:54:44,089
versus what's practical in their

1228
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:44,720
environment so that's a challenge but

1229
00:54:44,090 --> 00:54:47,150
genetics

1230
00:54:44,719 --> 00:54:49,848
such a big role at the end of the day it

1231
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:51,139
really I think gets overlooked in a lot

1232
00:54:49,849 --> 00:54:54,950
of ways people are always trying to

1233
00:54:51,139 --> 00:54:56,539
treat potentially plants that are

1234
00:54:54,949 --> 00:54:58,429
genetically weak and then trying to keep

1235
00:54:56,539 --> 00:55:02,599
them healthy and that's a real challenge

1236
00:54:58,429 --> 00:55:04,489
oh I couldn't agree with you more I

1237
00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:07,910
think I said earlier tad that you know

1238
00:55:04,489 --> 00:55:10,818
with the proper genetics you really

1239
00:55:07,909 --> 00:55:14,449
won't have too many issues but if you do

1240
00:55:10,818 --> 00:55:16,519
your biologicals will work well because

1241
00:55:14,449 --> 00:55:19,009
the pressure didn't get out of hand so

1242
00:55:16,519 --> 00:55:20,630
rapidly and I like you have been in

1243
00:55:19,010 --> 00:55:22,579
facilities where there's different

1244
00:55:20,630 --> 00:55:24,108
varieties side by side one getting ate

1245
00:55:22,579 --> 00:55:26,300
up by something the other one looks

1246
00:55:24,108 --> 00:55:27,529
beautiful I'll say I can be not growing

1247
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:29,180
more of this and well this one what

1248
00:55:27,530 --> 00:55:31,430
everybody wants and I said we'll send it

1249
00:55:29,179 --> 00:55:33,108
to your sister facility you guys should

1250
00:55:31,429 --> 00:55:35,899
concentrate on this variety because you

1251
00:55:33,108 --> 00:55:37,549
know how to grow it well I mean yeah

1252
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:40,099
genetics are so important and you're

1253
00:55:37,550 --> 00:55:42,230
gonna see so much research being done on

1254
00:55:40,099 --> 00:55:46,940
genetics in the next couple of years it

1255
00:55:42,230 --> 00:55:48,289
it's gonna be so nice so I wanted to

1256
00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:50,750
jump back to powdery mildew I had

1257
00:55:48,289 --> 00:55:54,259
another question from a plant pathology

1258
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:57,289
perspective we see lately you mentioned

1259
00:55:54,260 --> 00:56:01,490
fans and airflow and a lot of growers

1260
00:55:57,289 --> 00:56:03,858
are removing quite a few quite a few

1261
00:56:01,489 --> 00:56:07,699
leaves families as a way of allowing

1262
00:56:03,858 --> 00:56:09,828
better airflow through the plant which

1263
00:56:07,699 --> 00:56:12,169
in general I tend to agree with now my

1264
00:56:09,829 --> 00:56:14,869
question is sort of in terms of

1265
00:56:12,170 --> 00:56:16,280
spreading powdery mildew you mentioned

1266
00:56:14,869 --> 00:56:17,180
that with botrytis those spores are

1267
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:19,869
riding in the air

1268
00:56:17,179 --> 00:56:22,699
what's going on with powdery mildew and

1269
00:56:19,869 --> 00:56:25,390
what's in a you know how much leaf

1270
00:56:22,699 --> 00:56:28,669
tissue should we be removing in a given

1271
00:56:25,389 --> 00:56:31,639
environment or a given canopy as a way

1272
00:56:28,670 --> 00:56:33,980
of optimizing our plants chance for

1273
00:56:31,639 --> 00:56:35,629
success against these against these

1274
00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:38,150
pathogens because when when I see a

1275
00:56:35,630 --> 00:56:42,050
space that's like when we get too many

1276
00:56:38,150 --> 00:56:43,639
leaves are too dense of a canopy in the

1277
00:56:42,050 --> 00:56:46,190
dig into that canopy not only can you

1278
00:56:43,639 --> 00:56:48,318
not scout it but you do see that's where

1279
00:56:46,190 --> 00:56:49,490
the powdery mildew wants to want to live

1280
00:56:48,318 --> 00:56:51,440
you know the areas that aren't getting

1281
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:53,229
good airflow so what kind of

1282
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:57,760
recommendations would you have around

1283
00:56:53,230 --> 00:57:03,190
sort of airflow and these pathogens

1284
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:06,390
why again but pottery airflows important

1285
00:57:03,190 --> 00:57:12,909
I mean and and so the leafing can be a

1286
00:57:06,389 --> 00:57:16,599
technique to help reduce the ability of

1287
00:57:12,909 --> 00:57:18,940
powdery mildew to get a foothold so I

1288
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:21,309
believe in deleting again how much

1289
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:22,690
should you do well doing nothing you

1290
00:57:21,309 --> 00:57:24,489
know you're getting good airflow number

1291
00:57:22,690 --> 00:57:26,409
one number two is belief enough that you

1292
00:57:24,489 --> 00:57:29,289
know you can scout in the middle of

1293
00:57:26,409 --> 00:57:32,769
something you know easier than having to

1294
00:57:29,289 --> 00:57:36,789
crawl in there so I mean the leafing

1295
00:57:32,769 --> 00:57:39,579
offers a couple of advantages so uh but

1296
00:57:36,789 --> 00:57:42,849
powdery likes to spread more by water

1297
00:57:39,579 --> 00:57:45,670
splashing on people's clothes it's not

1298
00:57:42,849 --> 00:57:47,829
blown around it's not wind dispersed or

1299
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:49,360
air dispersed like like poke try to so

1300
00:57:47,829 --> 00:57:52,650
that's an advantage of keeping that air

1301
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:55,329
flow up but again with patterning

1302
00:57:52,650 --> 00:57:56,769
temperatures importance get it up there

1303
00:57:55,329 --> 00:58:00,940
we talked about that at seventy-five a

1304
00:57:56,769 --> 00:58:05,079
little higher if you can and and you

1305
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:10,720
know powdery doesn't need free moisture

1306
00:58:05,079 --> 00:58:12,369
but pritus does patterning chin you can

1307
00:58:10,719 --> 00:58:14,889
get good airflow and stop it from

1308
00:58:12,369 --> 00:58:16,690
getting a foothold the botrytis it'll

1309
00:58:14,889 --> 00:58:18,579
help disperse it so there's no easy

1310
00:58:16,690 --> 00:58:21,550
solution or answer to that it's just

1311
00:58:18,579 --> 00:58:26,159
what's your biggest problem you know

1312
00:58:21,550 --> 00:58:29,769
play around with air flow watch over

1313
00:58:26,159 --> 00:58:32,079
fertilization I mean you know too much

1314
00:58:29,769 --> 00:58:34,690
fertilizer can alter the metabolites

1315
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:36,909
being produced by these medicinal plants

1316
00:58:34,690 --> 00:58:39,970
but also it can weaken and stress a

1317
00:58:36,909 --> 00:58:42,250
plant we know that an ornamental plants

1318
00:58:39,969 --> 00:58:45,459
the flowering plants you know if you add

1319
00:58:42,250 --> 00:58:49,059
too much nitrogen Pythium can attack the

1320
00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:51,639
roots more effectively white flies can

1321
00:58:49,059 --> 00:58:55,719
sense a plant is stressed and attack

1322
00:58:51,639 --> 00:58:57,909
more effectively in fact you know and

1323
00:58:55,719 --> 00:59:00,609
you guys have all heard about this some

1324
00:58:57,909 --> 00:59:03,969
of these so-called plant nutrition

1325
00:59:00,610 --> 00:59:07,000
products offering the ability to reduce

1326
00:59:03,969 --> 00:59:09,399
plant stress when plants get stressed

1327
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,989
they give off volatile and these

1328
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:14,900
volatiles are

1329
00:59:10,989 --> 00:59:17,500
gases ethylene is one that plants give

1330
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:20,450
off ethylene when they're stressed and

1331
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:22,909
issues can sense and detect that

1332
00:59:20,449 --> 00:59:26,778
ethylene emission and especially insects

1333
00:59:22,909 --> 00:59:30,399
and go and attack that plan so we be

1334
00:59:26,778 --> 00:59:35,268
cautious of too much cutting too much

1335
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:41,180
damage to a plant there are we have a a

1336
00:59:35,268 --> 00:59:44,469
plant nutrition called on guard and for

1337
00:59:41,179 --> 00:59:47,239
a lack of better terms this this this

1338
00:59:44,469 --> 00:59:48,288
amino acid based plant nutrition with

1339
00:59:47,239 --> 00:59:50,389
a500

1340
00:59:48,289 --> 00:59:52,640
for lack of better terms I'm going to

1341
00:59:50,389 --> 00:59:56,150
throw this out there is I call it prozac

1342
00:59:52,639 --> 01:00:00,259
for plants it reduces plant stressed and

1343
00:59:56,150 --> 01:00:03,380
in addition it is what I also call an

1344
01:00:00,259 --> 01:00:05,358
uber it helps transport nutrients inside

1345
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:08,778
the plant more effectively and

1346
01:00:05,358 --> 01:00:11,960
efficiently so you can utilize less

1347
01:00:08,778 --> 01:00:13,608
nutrients save money and not have salt

1348
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:16,849
built up so there are ways to try to

1349
01:00:13,608 --> 01:00:19,909
reduce stress in plants and I know that

1350
01:00:16,849 --> 01:00:22,548
University of Florida hired biostimulant

1351
01:00:19,909 --> 01:00:26,568
specialists a couple of years ago names

1352
01:00:22,548 --> 01:00:30,650
dr. schinsky Yaga Hara and he is working

1353
01:00:26,568 --> 01:00:33,259
on the use of bio stimulants because if

1354
01:00:30,650 --> 01:00:35,269
you can reduce plant stress plants are

1355
01:00:33,259 --> 01:00:38,358
capable on their own of fighting off a

1356
01:00:35,268 --> 01:00:40,879
lot of diseases and pathogens and

1357
01:00:38,358 --> 01:00:44,568
insects number one number two is they're

1358
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:48,440
not producing volatiles that help entice

1359
01:00:44,568 --> 01:00:51,018
problems to come in faster and if you

1360
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:53,980
can uptake nutrients more effectively

1361
01:00:51,018 --> 01:00:56,689
both your macro and your minor nutrients

1362
01:00:53,980 --> 01:00:58,400
the plants going to be healthier less

1363
01:00:56,690 --> 01:01:01,730
stressed and it can fight off a lot of

1364
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:03,619
problems on its own yeah I'm glad you

1365
01:01:01,730 --> 01:01:06,108
brought up over fertilization because I

1366
01:01:03,619 --> 01:01:07,869
have seen what your what you're talking

1367
01:01:06,108 --> 01:01:11,900
about there and relationship to nitrogen

1368
01:01:07,869 --> 01:01:14,599
and have you seen that sort of research

1369
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:16,369
done in an organic system where say that

1370
01:01:14,599 --> 01:01:19,579
nitrogen maybe have been applied in the

1371
01:01:16,369 --> 01:01:21,829
form of oh I don't know fish meal or

1372
01:01:19,579 --> 01:01:23,490
feather meal or some other form that's

1373
01:01:21,829 --> 01:01:26,700
not immediately available or key

1374
01:01:23,489 --> 01:01:29,309
lated where the you know you're waiting

1375
01:01:26,699 --> 01:01:33,239
for the microbes to break it down into a

1376
01:01:29,309 --> 01:01:35,789
plant available form are are you seeing

1377
01:01:33,239 --> 01:01:38,879
I mean I've seen where over application

1378
01:01:35,789 --> 01:01:41,400
of those products will cause bacterial

1379
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:43,410
blooms which and also raise the

1380
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:46,170
temperature of the soil which plants

1381
01:01:43,409 --> 01:01:49,019
don't like obviously but are you seeing

1382
01:01:46,170 --> 01:01:52,680
the same challenges around over

1383
01:01:49,019 --> 01:01:55,829
fertilization in organic soils I guess

1384
01:01:52,679 --> 01:01:57,629
or have you seen research on that I've

1385
01:01:55,829 --> 01:01:59,969
seen some research research is

1386
01:01:57,630 --> 01:02:02,369
continuing and there's a great deal of

1387
01:01:59,969 --> 01:02:04,829
research out there on organic production

1388
01:02:02,369 --> 01:02:06,750
because one of the limiting factors in

1389
01:02:04,829 --> 01:02:09,420
organic production is the availability

1390
01:02:06,750 --> 01:02:11,340
of good organic sources of nitrogen that

1391
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:13,889
are either too available or not

1392
01:02:11,340 --> 01:02:17,789
available and and your other needed

1393
01:02:13,889 --> 01:02:19,170
elements so work is being done I I can't

1394
01:02:17,789 --> 01:02:20,639
sit her and quote you on any of them

1395
01:02:19,170 --> 01:02:23,250
because a lot of it's still being

1396
01:02:20,639 --> 01:02:25,259
conducted I know here in Florida in the

1397
01:02:23,250 --> 01:02:27,179
southeast in general I hang out a lot

1398
01:02:25,260 --> 01:02:30,630
what I'm not in Mexico doing work is

1399
01:02:27,179 --> 01:02:33,210
that there's more and more interest in

1400
01:02:30,630 --> 01:02:35,789
some of these organic based inputs and

1401
01:02:33,210 --> 01:02:39,030
in fact we started a line a couple of

1402
01:02:35,789 --> 01:02:41,969
years ago of biological fertilizers we

1403
01:02:39,030 --> 01:02:45,000
call them where your nutrients are not

1404
01:02:41,969 --> 01:02:47,429
readily released by moisture temperature

1405
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:50,969
like a control release fertilizers you

1406
01:02:47,429 --> 01:02:55,589
literally need a living soil with good

1407
01:02:50,969 --> 01:02:58,049
biology to release the NPK because they

1408
01:02:55,590 --> 01:03:00,630
are released by microbes feeding on

1409
01:02:58,050 --> 01:03:02,400
these dried granular materials and not

1410
01:03:00,630 --> 01:03:04,800
by moisture and temperature like a lot

1411
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:06,450
of control releases are so there's a lot

1412
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:08,460
of interest in this area we as a company

1413
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:12,329
have interest in this area we'd like to

1414
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:15,539
develop specific plant nutrients for you

1415
01:03:12,329 --> 01:03:16,920
the cannabis needs and a lot of work is

1416
01:03:15,539 --> 01:03:18,389
being done in this area there are a lot

1417
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:20,159
of products out there to add there are

1418
01:03:18,389 --> 01:03:22,858
more products I mean

1419
01:03:20,159 --> 01:03:25,739
darn when I go to shows I see a lot of

1420
01:03:22,858 --> 01:03:28,049
stuff out there and when I start asking

1421
01:03:25,739 --> 01:03:30,719
specific questions I don't get specific

1422
01:03:28,050 --> 01:03:34,260
enough answers I get a lot of features

1423
01:03:30,719 --> 01:03:36,029
and benefits but not a lot of science so

1424
01:03:34,260 --> 01:03:38,460
I will say

1425
01:03:36,030 --> 01:03:42,570
there needs to be a whole lot more work

1426
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:44,309
than before we'll know what we need to

1427
01:03:42,570 --> 01:03:47,360
be doing as far as proper plant

1428
01:03:44,309 --> 01:03:51,779
nutrition both in organics and in

1429
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:53,460
cannabis production I can't agree with

1430
01:03:51,780 --> 01:03:55,170
you more there are a lot of products out

1431
01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:58,289
there like you said the new ones coming

1432
01:03:55,170 --> 01:04:00,690
on the market every day and it's it's

1433
01:03:58,289 --> 01:04:02,940
really hard one of the things that

1434
01:04:00,690 --> 01:04:04,889
Suzanne and I have had long discussions

1435
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:07,320
on and what she had me come down to the

1436
01:04:04,889 --> 01:04:09,869
biocontrol conference to give a talk on

1437
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:12,120
was specifically how do we how do we

1438
01:04:09,869 --> 01:04:13,529
evaluate or vet all of these products

1439
01:04:12,119 --> 01:04:16,079
you know what are the questions as

1440
01:04:13,530 --> 01:04:19,710
growers or end consumers do we need to

1441
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:21,719
be asking these companies to know not

1442
01:04:19,710 --> 01:04:24,449
only that what we're putting on our on

1443
01:04:21,719 --> 01:04:28,379
our plants is effective but that it's

1444
01:04:24,449 --> 01:04:30,329
even just as a low bar just safe for the

1445
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:32,070
end consumer because there have been

1446
01:04:30,329 --> 01:04:34,110
some companies in the past that have

1447
01:04:32,070 --> 01:04:36,870
been less than honest with us about what

1448
01:04:34,110 --> 01:04:38,460
they're putting in their product and so

1449
01:04:36,869 --> 01:04:41,759
there's some challenges around that too

1450
01:04:38,460 --> 01:04:43,800
but yeah this fertilizer thing I think

1451
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:45,240
is really interesting so I'm excited to

1452
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:48,380
see more research on the organic side

1453
01:04:45,239 --> 01:04:51,089
come out in relationship to optimal

1454
01:04:48,380 --> 01:04:52,769
nutrient levels associated with cannabis

1455
01:04:51,090 --> 01:04:55,289
and what those effects are on some of

1456
01:04:52,769 --> 01:05:00,300
these things like like you mentioned

1457
01:04:55,289 --> 01:05:01,949
like botrytis and powdery mildew and I

1458
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:04,350
look forward to the day we can do more

1459
01:05:01,949 --> 01:05:06,149
research to see how our products and

1460
01:05:04,349 --> 01:05:08,400
other types of biologicals like ours

1461
01:05:06,150 --> 01:05:10,769
affect metabolite production because I

1462
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:14,550
think that that is something that needs

1463
01:05:10,769 --> 01:05:17,369
to be understood and measured yeah well

1464
01:05:14,550 --> 01:05:20,039
Chris I know I know people are gonna

1465
01:05:17,369 --> 01:05:21,750
yell at me because you're you're a smart

1466
01:05:20,039 --> 01:05:23,849
guy I'm sure I didn't ask all the

1467
01:05:21,750 --> 01:05:26,159
questions I should have asked I'd love

1468
01:05:23,849 --> 01:05:28,349
to get you back on here at some point to

1469
01:05:26,159 --> 01:05:31,529
follow up but I really appreciate your

1470
01:05:28,349 --> 01:05:33,000
time today and you're explaining some of

1471
01:05:31,530 --> 01:05:37,019
these different microbes and pathogens

1472
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:38,610
was really helpful so thank you you're

1473
01:05:37,019 --> 01:05:40,559
welcome sir and it's been an honor to

1474
01:05:38,610 --> 01:05:42,210
talk with you and hopefully I've helped

1475
01:05:40,559 --> 01:05:44,489
a few cannabis growers out there

1476
01:05:42,210 --> 01:05:48,059
understand a little bit better about the

1477
01:05:44,489 --> 01:05:49,409
confusion that's going on there's a

1478
01:05:48,059 --> 01:05:49,739
whole lot of products out there being

1479
01:05:49,409 --> 01:05:53,549
off

1480
01:05:49,739 --> 01:05:55,919
- you just ask questions check them out

1481
01:05:53,550 --> 01:05:59,010
I mean there's a company we have over 25

1482
01:05:55,920 --> 01:06:02,369
years of history and ornamentals an

1483
01:05:59,010 --> 01:06:04,200
edible production and I'd like to say we

1484
01:06:02,369 --> 01:06:06,360
got all the answers in cannabis and hip

1485
01:06:04,199 --> 01:06:08,759
production but we don't we have

1486
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:09,990
questions we want to work with those

1487
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:11,640
that would like to work with us to

1488
01:06:09,989 --> 01:06:13,139
answer some of those questions and

1489
01:06:11,639 --> 01:06:16,049
that's the only way we're going to get

1490
01:06:13,139 --> 01:06:18,299
things done and as importantly tad we

1491
01:06:16,050 --> 01:06:20,880
need to make sure that we we have some

1492
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:23,670
sort of system in place in the future to

1493
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:25,700
certify or just to say these products

1494
01:06:23,670 --> 01:06:27,750
have been shown to help these haven't

1495
01:06:25,699 --> 01:06:29,699
good like you said there's a lot of

1496
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:31,860
products out there there's a there's a

1497
01:06:29,699 --> 01:06:33,389
lot of fermented products I don't want

1498
01:06:31,860 --> 01:06:35,820
to see anybody get harmed by people

1499
01:06:33,389 --> 01:06:38,219
coliforms or any anaerobic organisms so

1500
01:06:35,820 --> 01:06:43,289
be careful understand what you're doing

1501
01:06:38,219 --> 01:06:45,389
it may make sense to you the person

1502
01:06:43,289 --> 01:06:47,489
presenting the the product may have made

1503
01:06:45,389 --> 01:06:49,920
sense to you but ask around see what

1504
01:06:47,489 --> 01:06:51,539
people are using check out check out the

1505
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:53,070
company's websites he would take an

1506
01:06:51,539 --> 01:06:55,500
offer if they can't answer a whole lot

1507
01:06:53,070 --> 01:06:58,859
of questions I'd have a whole lot of

1508
01:06:55,500 --> 01:07:02,250
concerns about working with them I think

1509
01:06:58,858 --> 01:07:06,150
that's great advice yeah I appreciate

1510
