welcome to the Cannabis cultivation and

5
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:23,759
science podcast I'm your host Tad Hussey

6
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:25,740
of Kiss Organics

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,480
the podcast where we discuss The Cutting

8
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:29,579
Edge of growing from a science-based

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,019
perspective and drawn top experts from

10
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:33,299
around the industry to share their

11
00:00:31,018 --> 00:00:36,539
wisdom and knowledge my guest this week

12
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:37,979
is Dr Jack munz Dr munz has a decades

13
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:39,960
worth of experience in the field of

14
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:42,000
plant molecular genetics working on

15
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,460
complex Gene regulation and nutrient

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,200
metabolism projects He obtained a

17
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,058
Bachelor of Science in botany from

18
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,980
Colorado State University while working

19
00:00:48,058 --> 00:00:51,538
as a lab assistant facilitating the

20
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:54,058
development of genetic markers for

21
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:55,679
invasive species Jack then earned a

22
00:00:54,058 --> 00:00:57,599
master of science from Illinois State

23
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:59,340
University where he worked towards

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,260
increasing vegetable oils and temperate

25
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,760
grasses like corn for biodiesel

26
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:05,039
production using targeted gene

27
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:06,780
expression he then turned his PhD in

28
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,280
botany from the University of British

29
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,019
Columbia during which he worked to

30
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,180
unravel the genetic regulation of

31
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:14,938
nitrogen starvation responses in plants

32
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:17,280
with next-gen sequencing Technologies Dr

33
00:01:14,938 --> 00:01:19,500
Muntz is a lead scientist at Genie labs

34
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:23,299
and head of pathogen testing research

35
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,299
and development now on to the show

36
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,140
hey Jack thanks for coming on the show

37
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:27,140
today

38
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:30,539
thanks for having me I'm looking forward

39
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,180
to talking to you

40
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:36,060
yeah so uh if you could give listeners a

41
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:38,400
little background into uh your your

42
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,740
personal history and uh Three River

43
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,780
Three Rivers biotech uh why don't we

44
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:44,099
start there

45
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,320
absolutely

46
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:47,399
um so my background is plant molecular

47
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:49,500
genetics

48
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:52,259
um so I've been doing this for over 10

49
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,399
years now I've worked on a number of

50
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:55,680
projects

51
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:57,659
um I started working uh it's an

52
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,040
undergrad at Colorado State botany and

53
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:01,439
then went into uh

54
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,939
genetic projects working on biodiesel

55
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:06,239
and genetic engineering of crops for for

56
00:02:02,938 --> 00:02:09,179
biofuels so during that just a wealth of

57
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:10,079
genetic techniques that I learned

58
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:12,598
um

59
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,520
finished my PhD at University of British

60
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:17,159
Columbia and then took on a job with

61
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,920
Three Rivers biotech to develop genetic

62
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:22,739
diagnostic tools

63
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:25,458
for cannabis pathogens pathogens in

64
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:29,280
general in addition to sort of

65
00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:32,039
genotyping of cultivars for sort of

66
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,199
genetic identification purposes for our

67
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:36,598
tissue culture programs

68
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:39,479
um so Three Rivers biotech so we've been

69
00:02:36,598 --> 00:02:41,878
operating now for a few years

70
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:44,878
um we have labs in Canada and Washington

71
00:02:41,878 --> 00:02:48,239
and California for tissue culture and

72
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:49,919
for testing we have a lab in Washington

73
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,939
um just across the border for me and

74
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:56,518
then I'm based out of Canada myself but

75
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:59,519
um I sort of guide and go down there and

76
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:01,439
do testing for pathogens there as far as

77
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,000
what pathogens we test for so the main

78
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:05,939
ones hop late and thyroid

79
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,800
but then we can also test for 11 other

80
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:08,519
viruses

81
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,980
um

82
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:14,819
most of those are generic viruses to to

83
00:03:10,979 --> 00:03:17,818
uh just sort of broads broad range

84
00:03:14,818 --> 00:03:17,818
agriculture

85
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:24,080
um and in addition to that we do tests

86
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:26,459
for broad range fungal and bacterial

87
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,099
infections such as pithium infuseria and

88
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:29,939
botritis sort of those really big you

89
00:03:29,098 --> 00:03:31,439
know the Heavy Hitters in the

90
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:33,539
agriculture industry

91
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:35,818
um so yeah we have a variety of

92
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:38,158
different testing uh that we have

93
00:03:35,818 --> 00:03:40,619
available for folks but um but yeah it's

94
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:42,959
it's it's been very busy

95
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,219
um but that's sort of the where we're at

96
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,239
and then as far as the tissue culture

97
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:46,098
goes

98
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:49,980
um

99
00:03:46,098 --> 00:03:52,259
we provide storage and cleanup of

100
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:56,039
cultivars and we've gotten the timelines

101
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:58,079
really down to a shorter window so we're

102
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:59,579
looking we can get plants back out in

103
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,260
about three months best case scenario

104
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:03,000
and the price has gone down

105
00:04:01,259 --> 00:04:04,620
substantially too because tissue culture

106
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,019
is pretty expensive but um but we've

107
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:09,658
gotten it to be more amenable to a

108
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:11,938
market that is fast moving so so that's

109
00:04:09,658 --> 00:04:14,759
great yeah now we've been working with

110
00:04:11,938 --> 00:04:15,479
you and offering your pathogen testing

111
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:18,238
um

112
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:20,459
for over a year now maybe like a year

113
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:22,918
and a half I would guess off top my head

114
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:24,000
and that's been going really well all

115
00:04:22,918 --> 00:04:28,139
the feedback we've gotten has been

116
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,600
really positive and uh a good friend of

117
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:32,460
mine Justin McGill over at Mako Farms is

118
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,379
now doing some tissue culturing we need

119
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:36,719
to clean up some of his genetics while

120
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:38,699
he does a quick Farm reset here

121
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,720
um with the LCB so I'm excited for that

122
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:42,060
and we're going to be able to offer

123
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,560
those as well through kiss so I'm I'm

124
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:46,680
looking forward to being able to have

125
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,240
those things available and um

126
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,519
yeah let's just Dive Right into this

127
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:54,120
podcast so I do want to touch a little

128
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:55,680
bit on some other uh viruses that you do

129
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,360
tests for and some of your other testing

130
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,360
protocols and what folks can look for

131
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:03,900
but the main point of this this podcast

132
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:07,259
was because I recently attended that

133
00:05:03,899 --> 00:05:09,539
webinar that Dr uh punja put on uh Dr

134
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:11,639
zamir punja who's doing uh really the

135
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:14,520
cutting-ed research it appears on

136
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:16,800
hoplate and thyroid and he worked with

137
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:18,240
you guys in conjunction with you guys on

138
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,620
some of this with the testing can you

139
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,360
talk about that relationship really

140
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,800
quickly

141
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,900
yeah absolutely

142
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,819
um so early on

143
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:28,799
um I think it's like two and a half

144
00:05:26,819 --> 00:05:31,379
years ago um we connected with with Dr

145
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,418
punja at a conference here in uh in

146
00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:35,038
British Columbia an agricultural one

147
00:05:33,418 --> 00:05:37,620
that had a focus on some hemp and

148
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:38,879
cannabis stuff that um he has been

149
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:42,000
working in the field of cannabis and

150
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:44,339
hemp for a a while now mostly a lot of

151
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,379
Publications on on fusarium and pythium

152
00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:47,758
some of the botry to some of the fungal

153
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:49,379
pathogens

154
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,199
um but when he's been out there in the

155
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:54,360
field with Growers just saw sort of how

156
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:56,520
how widespread to miss hoplate and

157
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,500
viroid might actually be and so we

158
00:05:56,519 --> 00:06:00,060
started testing at a few big

159
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,639
cultivations that he collaborates with

160
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,959
and just in networks that he knows and

161
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,478
to sort of see the extent of the problem

162
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:09,659
a couple years ago and from there it

163
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:12,000
just sort of you know Snowball downhill

164
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:13,979
um took off as he realized that we know

165
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,839
not enough about this viroid we don't

166
00:06:13,978 --> 00:06:18,418
know how it spreads don't know the

167
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:19,859
stability and so he took it and just ran

168
00:06:18,418 --> 00:06:23,339
with it and so as far as the academic

169
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:25,080
side goes he's um just it's just a

170
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:27,299
wonderful resource of knowledge but as

171
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:30,000
far as what we've done with him is um

172
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:32,400
you know really high throughput large

173
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,439
screens to get a handle on on spread

174
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:36,239
which is challenging

175
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:38,399
um So within a big facility how is it

176
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,500
spreading and so getting some big

177
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:42,659
numbers on that kind of thing

178
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:46,019
testing different parts of the plant and

179
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:48,479
so both working with with Dr bernja and

180
00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:50,639
also a nursery in Oregon

181
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:51,779
um we were basically looking at

182
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,240
different parts of the plant to see

183
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:57,299
where hop late and viroid actually is

184
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,918
most prevalent and found that it is much

185
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:01,560
much higher in The Roots than anywhere

186
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:03,719
else in the plant and so one of the main

187
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,399
takeaways is just that testing leaves

188
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,440
and stems is going to give you a lot of

189
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:08,818
false negatives and testing Roots is

190
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:12,240
about four times more accurate we're

191
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:14,520
talking around 80 85 percent of the time

192
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,960
you can detect detect the positive in

193
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:18,000
The Roots whereas you're only detecting

194
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:20,098
positives in the leaves and stems about

195
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,720
25 to 30 of the time so it's a big

196
00:07:20,098 --> 00:07:23,219
difference

197
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,979
um and particularly when you're talking

198
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:27,479
about a latent viroid and you're going

199
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:29,219
to have to do more than one test to

200
00:07:27,478 --> 00:07:31,079
really prove a negative

201
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:33,660
um having

202
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:36,060
only a 25 to 30 hit rate in a known

203
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:38,460
infected plant it's just way too low to

204
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:40,019
really get you ahead of the viroid um

205
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:41,159
and so it's you're always playing

206
00:07:40,019 --> 00:07:43,019
catch-up

207
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,460
um so yeah that's one of the main

208
00:07:43,019 --> 00:07:47,038
aspects

209
00:07:44,459 --> 00:07:48,180
um also then the spread we did water

210
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:50,098
testing so that's something I've been

211
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:54,120
developing too is is being able to

212
00:07:50,098 --> 00:07:56,038
filter water systems and test viroid in

213
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:58,860
circulating water systems and so we did

214
00:07:56,038 --> 00:08:01,918
find that the hoplane viroid can be

215
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:04,620
detected in in recirculating water and

216
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:07,318
that can lead to infections that are on

217
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:09,959
that same flood table or anywhere in

218
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:14,460
contact with that water so a lot of

219
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:18,060
interesting findings absolutely so I the

220
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:20,878
the root thing is is relatively new in

221
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:23,699
the last what year or so would you say

222
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:27,240
that that research has shown and so

223
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:29,038
if a grower suspects they may have hop

224
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,819
late and viroid

225
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:32,819
um

226
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:36,000
what is the recommended sampling and

227
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:38,278
testing protocol to really determine uh

228
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,179
infection right

229
00:08:38,278 --> 00:08:43,860
yeah so we conducted those studies

230
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:46,739
um both here in Canada and in the states

231
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:48,060
it was uh August I think is when a lot

232
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,200
of that testing was done and then we

233
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:50,639
sort of released some of those findings

234
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,259
in september-ish so yeah it is

235
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:53,838
relatively new

236
00:08:52,259 --> 00:08:56,039
um and at this point you know it's

237
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,959
strongly you know I always strongly

238
00:08:56,039 --> 00:09:00,480
recommend testing Roots

239
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:02,399
um as far as testing protocols go the

240
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,860
type of Route you need is not you don't

241
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,360
need like a a central

242
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,860
um essential thick root that's that's

243
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,600
coming off of the root Crown like the

244
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,919
fibrous Roots around plant pots are

245
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,379
great

246
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:16,620
um so small root samples are fine

247
00:09:13,379 --> 00:09:17,419
as far as testing protocols go

248
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:20,459
um

249
00:09:17,419 --> 00:09:22,379
if you're able to take a small snip from

250
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:26,219
multiple parts around the plant that can

251
00:09:22,379 --> 00:09:28,500
help because even with roots there's

252
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:30,300
still some false negatives where it's

253
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,458
just not in the sample

254
00:09:30,299 --> 00:09:34,919
um so like I said it's about 80 85

255
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:38,099
accurate so we always recommend multiple

256
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:41,579
tests so zamir so Dr printer would

257
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:43,200
recommend three negative tests in a row

258
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,639
um I understand the constraints of Oak

259
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,740
Growers so I always recommend a minimum

260
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:49,439
of two and spread those out you know

261
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:51,240
three to four weeks and spreading them

262
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,600
out what that does is if it is a latent

263
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:57,959
infection like it's a newer infection a

264
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,220
few weeks is time for that viral load to

265
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:00,778
sort of increase to the point where it's

266
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:03,120
easier to detect

267
00:10:00,778 --> 00:10:04,860
um in the meantime those plants if you

268
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,440
do suspect an infection should be

269
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:09,419
quarantined shouldn't be sharing water

270
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,360
sources with other plants that you know

271
00:10:09,419 --> 00:10:14,338
are negative and and certainly not in

272
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,839
production rooms until you know that

273
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:18,000
they're negative otherwise you could be

274
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,600
spreading it without knowing

275
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,480
um

276
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,740
so yeah the testing protocols small bits

277
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:25,680
of roots from around the plant if

278
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:27,600
possible or you know multiple tests

279
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:29,419
always multiple tests that are negative

280
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,040
to ensure that you're getting a negative

281
00:10:29,419 --> 00:10:33,778
and always Roots you know there's just

282
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:35,159
really no point in testing leaves and

283
00:10:33,778 --> 00:10:37,019
stems now

284
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:37,919
um and then the one other point that I

285
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:40,799
mentioned

286
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:43,500
is that I have some preliminary data in

287
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:46,500
my lab young plants are also not a great

288
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:48,480
place to test so we took cuttings from

289
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:51,299
positive moms

290
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,459
rooted them and then tested every month

291
00:10:51,299 --> 00:10:54,719
and that first month in a positive

292
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:56,338
cutting even

293
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,379
the detection goes away for that first

294
00:10:56,339 --> 00:11:01,079
month and then it comes back to three

295
00:10:58,379 --> 00:11:02,879
months later so that

296
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:04,559
right after cloning is a terrible time

297
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:07,139
to test you want to test your old moms

298
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:08,399
before you do your cuttings and teens

299
00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:10,439
when you're trying to select new moms

300
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,600
teens before you up pot to Big pots

301
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:15,180
those are two critical moments that you

302
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:17,820
can get a better representative sample

303
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:21,778
of if they're positive or not

304
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:26,519
that's important and how much root mass

305
00:11:21,778 --> 00:11:28,559
do you need to actually uh do a sample

306
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:30,959
or a test right yeah very little so yeah

307
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:33,179
our testing we're talking about a

308
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:35,159
centimeter of fibrous Roots

309
00:11:33,179 --> 00:11:37,199
um so the actual mass if you were to

310
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:39,419
weigh it on a scale

311
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,160
um about 100 milligrams is sort of the

312
00:11:39,419 --> 00:11:42,899
upper limit so very small amount of

313
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:45,179
tissues needed so these molecular

314
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:45,839
amplification tests

315
00:11:45,179 --> 00:11:47,759
um

316
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,440
too much sample can actually overload it

317
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:52,200
so if you have too much genetic material

318
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,820
in a reaction a PCR reaction or a lamp

319
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,680
reaction it'll actually cause it to fail

320
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:58,200
especially

321
00:11:55,679 --> 00:12:02,578
um in plants there's a lot of junk

322
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:04,440
um cell walls so plant material is more

323
00:12:02,578 --> 00:12:07,019
challenging than than humans or animal

324
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:09,540
material to extract RNA from because of

325
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:11,759
the cell wall it's a complex mixture of

326
00:12:09,539 --> 00:12:13,919
pectins and carbohydrates and lignin and

327
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:17,159
and that goop can really interfere with

328
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:20,639
PCR and other methods of nucleic acid

329
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:23,399
amplification so the sample size is

330
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:25,379
better if it's in that smaller range

331
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:27,778
uh so yeah we need very little amount of

332
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:29,159
root and we want it you know if you can

333
00:12:27,778 --> 00:12:31,620
take it from the the periphery of the

334
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:33,059
plant and just be as least invasive as

335
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,740
possible

336
00:12:33,059 --> 00:12:35,458
um that's great

337
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,959
um

338
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:40,078
and then

339
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:43,739
yeah I mean if you're able to take

340
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:45,479
samples from around the pot you can get

341
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:47,519
a better sort of representative sample

342
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:49,920
so you can take like a centimeter from

343
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:52,200
around the pot the maximum we would

344
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:54,659
suggest is is maybe five centimeters of

345
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:56,579
thin roots and then beyond that if it's

346
00:12:54,659 --> 00:12:59,399
beyond that

347
00:12:56,578 --> 00:13:01,500
um it can cause a reaction to fail so

348
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:03,120
we don't like to but if we have to we

349
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,620
have to pull some of the sample out but

350
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,899
preferably not because we like to keep

351
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:09,659
everything in one tube that was my next

352
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:12,659
question was if we send you too much in

353
00:13:09,659 --> 00:13:14,519
a sample you you will adjust it

354
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:16,939
appropriately for a better result it

355
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:16,940
sounds like

356
00:13:17,578 --> 00:13:20,879
sometimes I'll flag it I mean if it's a

357
00:13:19,259 --> 00:13:23,879
you know it's

358
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:25,860
it's really really a headache to have to

359
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:28,439
adjust the sample volume

360
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:30,240
um because we have to do it in a

361
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:32,220
controlled fashion that I don't you know

362
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,480
I I can't risk it contaminating anything

363
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:36,000
else so I have to take it to a separate

364
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,680
bench and it's a lot longer

365
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,120
um so our turnaround time so when we

366
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:41,219
receive samples we can turn around

367
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,679
results to you within 24 to 48 hours

368
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:46,560
during business days

369
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:48,179
um but that timeline can get really

370
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:50,879
thrown off if I have to adjust samples

371
00:13:48,179 --> 00:13:52,620
uh and so it's you know one time I can

372
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:53,879
do it but it's it's not something that I

373
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:56,100
would repeat you know I would basically

374
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:57,240
just say I'll send you new test kits and

375
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,639
you'll have to send new samples because

376
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:01,320
it's um it really throws a monkey wrench

377
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:03,360
into the works to have samples that are

378
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,320
too large and it doesn't help it really

379
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,240
doesn't

380
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,399
um the

381
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,740
the larger the sample like I said it can

382
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,360
cause failure in the reaction and if

383
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:16,200
that were to happen I can then dilute

384
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:18,419
the sample and try again but um the

385
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:20,700
small I mean we're talking a small

386
00:14:18,419 --> 00:14:21,958
sample of of a centimeter is millions of

387
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,700
cells and each one of those cells

388
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:25,559
presumably has millions of copies of the

389
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:28,200
viroid and these are really really

390
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:29,219
sensitive methods so if it's in the

391
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,320
sample

392
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:32,940
we will find it

393
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:35,660
um the

394
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:38,579
sampling from around the plant is more

395
00:14:35,659 --> 00:14:39,958
if it's a newer infection and it's more

396
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:41,338
present in one side of the roots you

397
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:43,379
know if you have a

398
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:45,839
plants that are sharing or touching it

399
00:14:43,379 --> 00:14:48,120
all then perhaps one side may have a

400
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:50,279
viral load in it but

401
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:53,220
I've tried pooling samples and I usually

402
00:14:50,278 --> 00:14:55,679
don't see an increase in sensitivity

403
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:57,360
um you're not I don't miss results

404
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:58,919
because of that I miss it more from

405
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,480
biological reasons

406
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:02,639
um so if it's not in the sample yet

407
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,459
that's why we recommend multiple tests

408
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:07,919
space you know three weeks apart that's

409
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:10,259
a better way to go than pooling samples

410
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:12,360
um because comparing so we did it when

411
00:15:10,259 --> 00:15:13,919
we did the full study of all testing all

412
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:16,320
the different root types

413
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:19,019
I also compared pooling versus single

414
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:22,560
samples and the increase percent of

415
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:24,899
positives I didn't find any uh I think

416
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:27,479
maybe one out of hundreds there is a

417
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:29,578
pooled sample that tested positive

418
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:31,740
um that missed maybe a single sample

419
00:15:29,578 --> 00:15:33,299
would have missed so it's um

420
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:34,799
it's more one of those things I suggest

421
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:36,479
if people are really worried and they

422
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:38,399
want to send you know a representative

423
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,778
sample that's great but

424
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,919
um you're not gonna if you just send a

425
00:15:39,778 --> 00:15:42,179
single sample you're not going to miss

426
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:45,479
it really either

427
00:15:42,179 --> 00:15:47,819
um so more important is multiple tests

428
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:50,220
spaced out over time that's more

429
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:52,980
important than a pool sample

430
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:55,759
great and I'm you had mentioned mother

431
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:58,699
plants and fresh clones

432
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:02,039
I'm looking at this slide here I I

433
00:15:58,698 --> 00:16:04,078
screenshot a few slides from the uh

434
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:05,639
presentation from the webinar so I would

435
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:09,299
have notes to go off of with you here

436
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:11,100
and uh one of the first slides in the

437
00:16:09,299 --> 00:16:13,139
presentation says symptoms on mother

438
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:16,019
plants with the note being that most

439
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:18,480
mother plants are asymptomatic

440
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:22,259
can you talk about that

441
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,259
yeah yeah so

442
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:27,299
the oh man this viroid is such a pain in

443
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:28,039
the neck because

444
00:16:27,299 --> 00:16:30,899
um

445
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:34,078
oftentimes it will be asymptomatic

446
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:37,259
um and the reasons we don't have an

447
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:39,239
exact trigger for why symptoms sometimes

448
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:41,699
manifest so why disease is happening

449
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:43,980
that is an area that Dr punja is

450
00:16:41,698 --> 00:16:46,019
actively researching as to why there's a

451
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:49,379
a trigger between latent symptoms so

452
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:50,360
asymptomatic and a disease dotted plant

453
00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:53,100
um

454
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:56,039
the some of the possibilities would be

455
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:57,920
changes in photo period might trigger a

456
00:16:56,039 --> 00:17:00,240
proliferation of the viroid

457
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:04,078
environmental stresses might trigger a

458
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:07,679
proliferation in the viroid so

459
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:08,938
most facilities are you know I mean The

460
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,259
Growers have been growing for a long

461
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:12,540
time they're really great it grows and

462
00:17:10,259 --> 00:17:14,160
so their plants are super healthy that

463
00:17:12,539 --> 00:17:16,078
may have some reasons as why it's

464
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,759
asymptomatic a lot of the times is that

465
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:20,039
the plants are super healthy and so

466
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:22,259
they're not manifesting symptoms but

467
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:24,959
until we know what that trigger is I

468
00:17:22,259 --> 00:17:27,480
can't say for sure why some are diseased

469
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,880
or not but there does appear to be

470
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,319
a combination of genotype and

471
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,840
environmental conditions that when

472
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:36,379
together can cause a manifestation of

473
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:39,119
dudding loss of potency

474
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:41,400
morphological changes you know stunting

475
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:44,219
all those it does appear that

476
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:47,280
environment plus genotype play a role so

477
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:50,100
some genotype types may be more

478
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:51,660
susceptible to that trigger that switch

479
00:17:50,099 --> 00:17:53,219
um which stands to reason especially if

480
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:55,259
it if it does end up being a photo

481
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:56,759
period response obviously different

482
00:17:55,259 --> 00:17:57,599
cultivars have different you know

483
00:17:56,759 --> 00:17:59,279
different different genotypes have

484
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:01,439
different responses to flowering and

485
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:03,599
photo period so

486
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,519
um yeah we're still trying to find more

487
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:08,219
answers on that

488
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:10,379
um but it is certainly

489
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:12,419
most a lot of the time there are a lot

490
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:15,419
of asymptomatic infections

491
00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:17,280
um and that was sort of an eye-opening

492
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:19,740
moment when we were doing these um early

493
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:20,940
studies with large-scale facilities and

494
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:22,859
we're like oh wow there's a lot more

495
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:24,840
here than we realized yeah and

496
00:18:22,859 --> 00:18:26,459
anecdotally I would say from the

497
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:29,699
facilities that we work with that have

498
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:32,579
done testing that have

499
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:34,380
um known infections and because a lot of

500
00:18:32,579 --> 00:18:35,939
our guys are running living soil in bed

501
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:37,440
so they're raising the soil which

502
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:39,600
creates more challenges around this

503
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:42,480
thyroid for sure

504
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:44,459
um if they're able to have a really uh

505
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:47,099
good run where they don't have a lot of

506
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:48,840
uh abiotic stresses

507
00:18:47,099 --> 00:18:50,459
um you know just healthy plants that

508
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:54,359
they're able to keep happy they don't

509
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:56,400
see it really Express itself as much

510
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:59,519
um and and so that would fit sort of

511
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:03,780
with what you're saying I guess my

512
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:05,819
question around that is so so if we have

513
00:19:03,779 --> 00:19:09,259
say a positive infection and we have a

514
00:19:05,819 --> 00:19:11,639
plant in a room that we know is infected

515
00:19:09,259 --> 00:19:13,019
what are the chances then that the we

516
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,340
can't assume that the rest of the plants

517
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:17,819
in the room are clean because they're

518
00:19:14,339 --> 00:19:20,639
not expressing is that accurate

519
00:19:17,819 --> 00:19:22,798
that's accurate yeah unfortunately it's

520
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,860
no different than any other you know

521
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:29,099
viral outbreak where if you think

522
00:19:25,859 --> 00:19:30,599
there's been close contact

523
00:19:29,099 --> 00:19:33,480
UM those plants have to sort of go into

524
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:34,859
a quarantine mode where you're yeah you

525
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,480
have to you the only way to know is

526
00:19:34,859 --> 00:19:38,819
molecular testing especially when it's

527
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:41,700
asymptomatic but even with symptoms

528
00:19:38,819 --> 00:19:43,859
expressing to rule out you know any

529
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,940
other cause molecular testing is the

530
00:19:43,859 --> 00:19:46,500
only way I mean there's no way to walk

531
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:49,080
into a facility look at a plant say

532
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:50,700
that's for sure without a doubt you know

533
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:52,740
hotline viral the only way to know is

534
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:54,360
testing but yeah in that situation where

535
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:56,220
you have a positive plant and you have

536
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:58,199
other plants that are really you know

537
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:00,660
anywhere in that room facility out you

538
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:02,580
know grow just in general

539
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:04,860
um maybe they they were cloned same

540
00:20:02,579 --> 00:20:07,079
cutting table something like that

541
00:20:04,859 --> 00:20:09,240
um any kind of you know you have to

542
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:11,038
contact Trace essentially

543
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,660
um and from there the only way to know

544
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:14,940
is is testing

545
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:16,679
um so yeah it's

546
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:19,440
sort of yeah it's pernicious I mean it's

547
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:21,600
and it's a very stable viroid too so it

548
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:24,000
actually can last on surfaces for weeks

549
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:25,619
and that's another area of study that Dr

550
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,538
plunger has been been working on is just

551
00:20:25,619 --> 00:20:30,899
how stable is this thing and that's not

552
00:20:27,538 --> 00:20:33,538
uncommon for viroids um they are just by

553
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:35,640
their nature they're these small rnas

554
00:20:33,538 --> 00:20:37,980
that form it's a single stranded

555
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:39,780
circular RNA but it forms a complex

556
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:42,538
where it binds with itself and it

557
00:20:39,779 --> 00:20:45,119
basically is really tight organization

558
00:20:42,538 --> 00:20:48,000
that it's really hard to degrade

559
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:50,639
um both by just all the normal things

560
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,558
that degrade viruses and and DNA in

561
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,538
general and RNA in general

562
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:55,918
um it is really stable it's surprisingly

563
00:20:54,538 --> 00:21:00,058
stable so that's

564
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:02,460
the unfortunate reality of thyroids

565
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:04,619
yeah so let's touch on that a little bit

566
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:06,960
um yep

567
00:21:04,619 --> 00:21:10,019
some of the recent research shows that

568
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:12,419
heat is not a treatment option with this

569
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:14,460
viroid

570
00:21:12,419 --> 00:21:15,240
from what I understand yeah

571
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:18,000
um

572
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:19,200
it's it's like really high heat

573
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,880
um so

574
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,860
okay so we're still working through that

575
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,140
on hoplate and thyroid specifically so a

576
00:21:22,859 --> 00:21:26,939
lot of you know what I look to when I

577
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:28,919
get sort of rough numbers is is

578
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:30,120
something like potato spindle tuber

579
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:32,100
viroid

580
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:33,779
sorry potato tube or spindle viral I'd

581
00:21:32,099 --> 00:21:37,439
always get those two mixed up

582
00:21:33,779 --> 00:21:39,839
um the word so ptsvd

583
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,159
um that is one of the well-known viroids

584
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:42,418
that has had a lot of studies on it was

585
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:44,159
I think the first one that was

586
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:46,380
identified back in the 80s but it wasn't

587
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:47,940
until molecular genetics techniques

588
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:50,940
caught up that they were able to detect

589
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:52,019
what a viroid actually was so viroids in

590
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:53,880
general

591
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:56,879
um we're finding more now that we have

592
00:21:53,880 --> 00:22:00,600
more genetics tools to find them but

593
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:02,700
that vibrate potato tuber spindle viroid

594
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:05,219
they have shown they have expert like

595
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:08,038
really really high resolution electron

596
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:09,659
micrographs so microscopes that can see

597
00:22:08,038 --> 00:22:12,359
at that level

598
00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:14,100
um when you heat up the viroid that

599
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:16,319
tight structure it forms it does start

600
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:18,480
to pop back into a circle at around 70

601
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:19,079
Celsius

602
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,900
um

603
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:24,119
so there's some opportunities to make it

604
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:26,038
more susceptible to degradation at

605
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:28,439
really high heat

606
00:22:26,038 --> 00:22:31,019
um but to actually just degrade it just

607
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:33,058
just Bar None it's done it's not no

608
00:22:31,019 --> 00:22:36,538
longer infectious yeah heat is not

609
00:22:33,058 --> 00:22:39,599
looking to be super applicable

610
00:22:36,538 --> 00:22:41,519
um unfortunately uh just for those that

611
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:43,259
said I mean like you know certain

612
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:45,179
temperatures it can start to lose its

613
00:22:43,259 --> 00:22:46,798
form but for those of us stuck with an

614
00:22:45,179 --> 00:22:49,559
imperial system

615
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:52,319
um 70 Celsius converts to 158 degrees

616
00:22:49,558 --> 00:22:54,000
Fahrenheit which is a really tough

617
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:57,359
temperature to reach in a lot of Grow

618
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,419
rooms um safely and with HVAC equipment

619
00:22:57,359 --> 00:23:01,439
so yeah I just want to throw them yeah

620
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:03,120
it's more applicable to like

621
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,558
recirculating Water Systems where you

622
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:06,839
could heat that water up to a really

623
00:23:04,558 --> 00:23:09,418
really high temperature but even then

624
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:11,099
some of it still might get through

625
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:12,900
um because it's not it's maybe it's

626
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:14,699
losing its structure temporarily but

627
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:17,340
then when it cools back down it yeah so

628
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:19,919
this was more of a when we were thinking

629
00:23:17,339 --> 00:23:21,240
about that with some of this testing

630
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,620
um it was more directed towards

631
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,900
recirculating water and how you can

632
00:23:22,619 --> 00:23:26,459
sterilize it coming back through

633
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,538
um and it's yeah it's going to be it's

634
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:31,919
going to be a challenge

635
00:23:27,538 --> 00:23:33,960
so other other options are uh 20 bleach

636
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:36,480
I'm looking at the notes here

637
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:40,259
um 20 bleach vercon

638
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:41,120
um how well do you oxidizers work

639
00:23:40,259 --> 00:23:44,339
um

640
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:45,538
hydrogen peroxide based products

641
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:46,199
yeah

642
00:23:45,538 --> 00:23:48,720
yeah

643
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:50,940
um okay so again working through this

644
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,100
stuff and and Dr punja has more probably

645
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:55,200
hop late and specific information that

646
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:57,418
he's going to release when he's ready

647
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,759
um but in general what I can tell you is

648
00:23:57,419 --> 00:24:02,280
is he knows that vercon asks a two

649
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:04,919
percent work on S is the most effective

650
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:06,538
um and that tracks with other viroids

651
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:08,460
um so two percent burcon s is the most

652
00:24:06,538 --> 00:24:12,900
effective Next Step would probably be 10

653
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:14,519
bleach for three to five minutes but you

654
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:17,700
know obviously bleach stinks and it

655
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:19,379
corrodes your your your pruning tools so

656
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,700
I recommend bleach because it's just

657
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:22,080
something that everybody knows it's

658
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,400
common

659
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:26,220
um and that's typically you know it's

660
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:28,980
pretty standard to use bleach uh 10 at

661
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:30,480
least now you said 20. so

662
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:31,980
um if that's you know doctor's

663
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:35,159
recommendation then yeah it might it

664
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:36,599
might take 20 to really be effective

665
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:41,000
um so those are the top two two percent

666
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:44,279
work on S uh and then 10 Bleach then the

667
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,279
uh sort of hydrogen peroxide based and

668
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:48,960
an ethanol based alcohol-based stuff

669
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:51,000
typically those are less infective or

670
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:53,100
less effective for viroids so again

671
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,200
going back to potato tube or spindle

672
00:24:53,099 --> 00:24:57,240
viroid they didn't find that those to be

673
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,200
particularly effective

674
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,700
um

675
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,740
and so I I think that would probably

676
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:03,600
track with hopley structurally all the

677
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:04,919
viroids have a similar structure they

678
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:07,199
don't make proteins they don't have a

679
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:08,940
protein coat they're just naked RNA that

680
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,558
forms a little you know a circular

681
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,400
structure that forms a little

682
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:13,200
um

683
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,700
complementary sequence that has you know

684
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,419
bumps in it but

685
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:17,400
um

686
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:20,340
structurally they're all very similar so

687
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:23,400
I think that the effect of you know the

688
00:25:20,339 --> 00:25:25,798
efficacy of some of those uh oxidizers

689
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:28,019
and and hydro hydrogen peroxide based

690
00:25:25,798 --> 00:25:30,839
you know sanitate kind of things uh

691
00:25:28,019 --> 00:25:32,220
ethanol based ones the the efficacy is

692
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:33,359
going to be lower than burcon S and

693
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:35,759
bleach

694
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:38,219
um and that data will probably be out

695
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:39,538
later this year um from from Dr punj's

696
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:41,700
lab so that we can actually have like

697
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:42,839
numbers on that

698
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:45,419
um

699
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:48,298
one thing to mention just quickly is

700
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:49,860
bleach even if you so so in potato tube

701
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:52,859
or spindle virally if you bleach for 30

702
00:25:49,859 --> 00:25:54,778
seconds it's no longer infectious

703
00:25:52,859 --> 00:25:57,058
um but they were still able to detect it

704
00:25:54,778 --> 00:25:58,259
with with PCR techniques from those

705
00:25:57,058 --> 00:25:59,639
swabs

706
00:25:58,259 --> 00:26:01,859
um so

707
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:03,419
it can make it no longer infectious but

708
00:26:01,859 --> 00:26:04,740
on surfaces you could still probably

709
00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:07,380
detect it

710
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:09,599
um but really all we care about is is it

711
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:12,000
infecting more plants right so

712
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:13,740
um so yeah those would be the top two

713
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,700
um if you're using things like sanity

714
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:16,500
and stuff

715
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,880
they may help

716
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:20,159
um but they're not going to be 100

717
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:21,000
effective and and really you know I mean

718
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,200
some of these other ones like like

719
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,940
bleach probably isn't going to be 100

720
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,960
effective on sterilizing seeds either

721
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:26,759
you're probably going to get stuff come

722
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:29,538
through

723
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:33,720
so how

724
00:26:29,538 --> 00:26:34,679
transmissible is this thyroid with

725
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:37,980
um

726
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:40,980
pruning tools handling of plants you

727
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:43,019
know onto clothing things like that

728
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:45,298
um when I think of things as small I

729
00:26:43,019 --> 00:26:47,158
just assume it's everywhere like how do

730
00:26:45,298 --> 00:26:49,259
we I know like

731
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:51,179
how do we move through a facility as

732
00:26:49,259 --> 00:26:52,019
safely as possible I guess is my

733
00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:54,240
question

734
00:26:52,019 --> 00:26:55,980
yeah I know and you can't see it it

735
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,919
starts to feel like it's everywhere

736
00:26:55,980 --> 00:27:00,778
um not don't be too worried about it uh

737
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:02,520
as far as like gentle touching so

738
00:27:00,778 --> 00:27:05,038
clothes and walking through facilities

739
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:07,379
and handling of plants the

740
00:27:05,038 --> 00:27:10,200
transmissibility is going to be low

741
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:12,179
um Airborne there's no evidence of it

742
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:15,360
being Airborne

743
00:27:12,179 --> 00:27:16,679
um the main ones is sap contact so if

744
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:18,119
you have if you're if you're being rough

745
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:19,820
with the plants and something breaks and

746
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:22,798
there's there's sort of that contact

747
00:27:19,819 --> 00:27:24,720
that's highly transmissible but just

748
00:27:22,798 --> 00:27:25,918
gentle touching uh things like that if

749
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,360
you're if you're sterilizing your

750
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:29,100
pruning tools if you're switching

751
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:30,719
pruning tools between cultivars or

752
00:27:29,099 --> 00:27:34,678
genotypes

753
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:37,919
um that is low level of transmission

754
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:39,659
uh I think some of the the main areas to

755
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:41,100
focus on is just the infected clones

756
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:42,900
from infected bombs so once a mom's

757
00:27:41,099 --> 00:27:44,339
infected you should just assume all the

758
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:46,440
Clones are going to be infected I've

759
00:27:44,339 --> 00:27:48,119
done some studies

760
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:49,679
um so as I had mentioned the roots are

761
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:51,839
the best place to test so we found some

762
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:54,120
some in the very large scale study we

763
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:56,038
had six positive moms and we took a

764
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:57,538
bunch of clones from those uh and we

765
00:27:56,038 --> 00:27:59,579
tested the cuttings of those clones and

766
00:27:57,538 --> 00:28:02,158
the cuttings came back negative now

767
00:27:59,579 --> 00:28:03,839
leaves and stems having less viroid so

768
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:06,539
then we rooted those and tested those

769
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:08,459
for six months every month and most of

770
00:28:06,538 --> 00:28:10,259
them did stay negative for those six

771
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:13,019
months but that doesn't necessarily mean

772
00:28:10,259 --> 00:28:14,940
they won't come back positive eventually

773
00:28:13,019 --> 00:28:15,960
um but what I'm trying to get at here is

774
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:18,720
that

775
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:20,519
you can suppress you know if you you can

776
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,319
get clones from a mom that will appear

777
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:24,000
negative at first

778
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:26,339
um and then perhaps many months later

779
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,619
you can probably get a harvest through

780
00:28:26,339 --> 00:28:30,778
um and then maybe you know maybe the

781
00:28:28,619 --> 00:28:32,699
next generation of clones it comes up

782
00:28:30,778 --> 00:28:34,859
positive again so that's one of the main

783
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:37,080
methods is just positive clones or you

784
00:28:34,859 --> 00:28:39,000
know clones from a positive mom

785
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:40,439
um the seeds there is seed transmission

786
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,019
so

787
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:45,659
you know I used to when I was when we're

788
00:28:43,019 --> 00:28:47,339
first sort of trying to figure out the

789
00:28:45,659 --> 00:28:49,559
transmissibility we were looking at Hops

790
00:28:47,339 --> 00:28:52,139
and hops it's also seed transmissible

791
00:28:49,558 --> 00:28:53,819
but levels are very low and so it seemed

792
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:55,919
like it might be a viable option to get

793
00:28:53,819 --> 00:28:57,480
away from it but seed Transmission in

794
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:59,220
cannabis is somewhere between five to

795
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:01,140
thirty percent

796
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:02,579
um so that's a big you know that's still

797
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:04,860
an issue

798
00:29:02,579 --> 00:29:06,778
um and then yeah the infected sap on

799
00:29:04,859 --> 00:29:07,979
contaminated pruning tools is is another

800
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:09,359
one so if you're cut if you're doing

801
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:11,579
trimming if you're doing active work

802
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:12,899
with those tools you got to sterilize

803
00:29:11,579 --> 00:29:15,240
between

804
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:16,500
preferably if you had a separate set you

805
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:19,019
know that'd be great and then you could

806
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:21,659
sterilize sort of longer instead of just

807
00:29:19,019 --> 00:29:22,980
a dunk and then move to the next Plant

808
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:25,140
um but just sort of the gentle touching

809
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:28,019
is not a big deal the other main

810
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:29,278
transmissible way is

811
00:29:28,019 --> 00:29:30,778
um you know like I said though the water

812
00:29:29,278 --> 00:29:32,579
transmission so if they're sharing the

813
00:29:30,778 --> 00:29:34,500
same table and those roots are in the

814
00:29:32,579 --> 00:29:37,500
same sort of

815
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:39,000
uh medium nutrient medium um that is

816
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:41,720
definitely a way that you can have

817
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,720
transmission

818
00:29:41,819 --> 00:29:45,178
um and then I guess

819
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:46,798
really an area that should be very

820
00:29:45,179 --> 00:29:48,480
sterile is your cloning tables and

821
00:29:46,798 --> 00:29:50,038
benches like wherever you're working on

822
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,899
those clones

823
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:53,398
um if you have infected clones from an

824
00:29:51,898 --> 00:29:56,459
affected mom and you're doing work on

825
00:29:53,398 --> 00:29:57,959
that bench that whole surface could be a

826
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:59,579
potential place that you could transmit

827
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:01,380
to another another set of clones so

828
00:29:59,579 --> 00:30:03,898
that's an area just to be really careful

829
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:05,760
of is uh is cracks between tables that

830
00:30:03,898 --> 00:30:08,599
you're working on for anything where

831
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:08,599
you're cutting plants

832
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:14,278
so if I'm understanding correctly I

833
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:17,038
could buy seeds or or get seeds in to my

834
00:30:14,278 --> 00:30:19,019
facility pop those seeds they could look

835
00:30:17,038 --> 00:30:21,480
the mother plant could look clean that

836
00:30:19,019 --> 00:30:23,879
plant those seeds could look clean and

837
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:25,740
then the second cycle I could make it

838
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:27,960
all the way through flour and then if I

839
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:29,778
clone off that plant down the road I

840
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:34,159
could still get

841
00:30:29,778 --> 00:30:37,740
uh hoplate and thyroid potentially

842
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:39,299
uh yeah so okay that's a tough one we're

843
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:41,220
still working on I mean the long term

844
00:30:39,298 --> 00:30:42,480
those really long-term projects are

845
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:44,399
difficult because you have to have

846
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,919
sterility like really really tight

847
00:30:44,398 --> 00:30:48,898
sterility in a lab facility for a long

848
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:51,480
period of time to get like

849
00:30:48,898 --> 00:30:52,859
this came from this seed without a doubt

850
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,899
there was no horizontal transmission

851
00:30:52,859 --> 00:30:55,859
from anywhere else so those studies are

852
00:30:54,898 --> 00:30:57,898
challenging

853
00:30:55,859 --> 00:31:00,959
what I can tell you is that seed

854
00:30:57,898 --> 00:31:02,699
transmission is is is is possible so

855
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,558
five to thirty percent we are getting

856
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:07,200
transmission through seeds you can try

857
00:31:04,558 --> 00:31:08,579
and surface sterilize but it's likely

858
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,080
transmitted via

859
00:31:08,579 --> 00:31:12,778
um so in hops it's transmitted via

860
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:15,298
pollen uh we don't know yet for for

861
00:31:12,778 --> 00:31:17,398
cannabis if it's just pollen or if it's

862
00:31:15,298 --> 00:31:18,480
pollen ant egg cells but it's in the

863
00:31:17,398 --> 00:31:20,339
seed

864
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,099
um presumably we're still working on

865
00:31:20,339 --> 00:31:25,980
those tests so

866
00:31:22,099 --> 00:31:27,119
the as far as the detection so if you

867
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:28,460
take that seed you bring them into your

868
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:31,558
facility you pop them you grow them

869
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:33,240
definitely should be testing those those

870
00:31:31,558 --> 00:31:34,619
um those plants

871
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,880
I would prefer they're at least a month

872
00:31:34,619 --> 00:31:37,798
old

873
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:39,840
um that's another area where there might

874
00:31:37,798 --> 00:31:42,418
be we might be missing things when

875
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:43,678
they're in that young seedling stage

876
00:31:42,419 --> 00:31:46,799
um

877
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:48,480
it seems like the Hop latent can

878
00:31:46,798 --> 00:31:51,119
basically hide from detection like we've

879
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:53,220
sampled a bunch of seedlings and that

880
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:55,019
specific stage of development in the

881
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:57,360
plant it seems to be able to suppress

882
00:31:55,019 --> 00:32:00,720
the viroid and it's not until it's older

883
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:02,038
so then really pivotal would be if

884
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,298
you're cloning you know once you have a

885
00:32:02,038 --> 00:32:05,398
mom and you're ready to make the next

886
00:32:03,298 --> 00:32:07,379
generation of moms from that that's a

887
00:32:05,398 --> 00:32:09,000
really pivotal place to test those roots

888
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:10,380
of that Mom I would expect to show I

889
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,880
would expect to see the hot Lane at that

890
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:14,340
point

891
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:16,679
um whether or not you know it would show

892
00:32:14,339 --> 00:32:17,398
up in the next Generation

893
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:19,259
Um

894
00:32:17,398 --> 00:32:22,199
I don't have the data to say that that's

895
00:32:19,259 --> 00:32:23,640
happening I just would caution people

896
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,019
against thinking that they're in the

897
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,940
clear as soon as they tested that Mom

898
00:32:25,019 --> 00:32:27,839
it's clean and now they never need a

899
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:30,600
test again

900
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:32,699
um it's just okay I think that that's

901
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:35,459
setting yourself up for for heartbreak

902
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:38,278
later if if stuff starts coming back

903
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:39,600
positive you know in a generation or two

904
00:32:38,278 --> 00:32:41,700
um

905
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:44,278
it's a completely different system but

906
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:45,960
lettuce sclerosis virus in cannabis

907
00:32:44,278 --> 00:32:47,278
sometimes the symptoms don't manifest

908
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,778
until the next Generation off that Mom

909
00:32:47,278 --> 00:32:50,579
and that's in a peer-reviewed

910
00:32:48,778 --> 00:32:53,099
publication where they saw more severe

911
00:32:50,579 --> 00:32:56,460
symptoms in the following generation

912
00:32:53,099 --> 00:32:59,339
so the verdict's still out on hot Bladen

913
00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:01,319
as far as does it get more severe you

914
00:32:59,339 --> 00:33:03,538
know the more Generations you go

915
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:05,099
um all we can do at this point is test

916
00:33:03,538 --> 00:33:06,480
them when they're old enough to test so

917
00:33:05,099 --> 00:33:08,459
for me that's about a month to two

918
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:10,620
months old to that teenage stage before

919
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:12,298
you up pot to Mom plants it's a great

920
00:33:10,619 --> 00:33:13,979
place to test them and then test before

921
00:33:12,298 --> 00:33:16,558
you know a week before you clone that

922
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:19,679
Mom test the roots then those are sort

923
00:33:16,558 --> 00:33:21,778
of the two Benchmark places that that um

924
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:25,919
working with with Growers that sort of

925
00:33:21,778 --> 00:33:28,140
seems to be a good place to check

926
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:29,460
um to see you know at the very least

927
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:30,480
you'll know that next Generation should

928
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:33,960
be clean

929
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:36,240
yeah you gave us some numbers and uh I'm

930
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:38,278
also looking at another slide from Dr

931
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:41,339
punj's presentation on some work with

932
00:33:38,278 --> 00:33:43,859
Toomey genomics that showed uh positive

933
00:33:41,339 --> 00:33:47,278
females crossed with a negative male

934
00:33:43,859 --> 00:33:49,619
meaning the the females had hop Laden

935
00:33:47,278 --> 00:33:52,558
the the male did not and the infection

936
00:33:49,619 --> 00:33:56,759
rate was 31 out of 71 seedlings which is

937
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:59,839
about 43 44 infection rate that varied

938
00:33:56,759 --> 00:34:02,519
from mother to mother from 23 to 53

939
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:05,819
with the thyroid present on the seed

940
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:07,740
coat and inside the seat itself so

941
00:34:05,819 --> 00:34:09,119
pretty high transmission rate

942
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:10,980
unfortunately

943
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:12,838
and yours was a little bit lower but

944
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:15,480
still a fairly High rate of transmission

945
00:34:12,838 --> 00:34:17,039
so I think that's something The Growers

946
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:18,960
should be

947
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:21,259
right I think that's teasing apart two

948
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:24,599
things I mean because the seed coat

949
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:25,919
that's yeah so when I was seeing talking

950
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:28,200
about transmission we're talking about

951
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:29,460
sort of inside the seed the actual seed

952
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:30,358
so if you sterilize the seed coat

953
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:33,418
hopefully you wouldn't get that

954
00:34:30,358 --> 00:34:36,179
transmission but um yeah so yeah it's

955
00:34:33,418 --> 00:34:37,679
pretty high for seed yeah oh okay so

956
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:39,720
you're this would be a reason to

957
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:42,559
sterilize outside of the sea coat as a

958
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:45,598
way of reducing yeah yeah absolutely

959
00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:48,719
right yeah see before you um before you

960
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:50,220
pop those seeds uh 10 bleach three to

961
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:52,079
five minutes to try and sterilize

962
00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:54,480
anything that's on the seed coat

963
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:56,639
um it may still I mean that

964
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,019
can't be 100 you can't be certain that

965
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:00,240
that's 100 effective getting everything

966
00:34:58,019 --> 00:35:02,219
off these seed coat but that should at

967
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:03,719
the very least lower that that

968
00:35:02,219 --> 00:35:06,598
transmission rate

969
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:10,919
um from just things that are residual

970
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:13,500
from the mom plant um just on seacoat

971
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:15,780
so that brings up another

972
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:18,000
topic um that I wanted I wanted to

973
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:19,920
discuss with you so this idea of viral

974
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,539
load I know that just from everything

975
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,820
we've been learning with covid and how

976
00:35:21,539 --> 00:35:27,179
viruses work I know with this particular

977
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:30,780
viroid if we're able to lower the the

978
00:35:27,179 --> 00:35:34,319
load the amount of viroid present is

979
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:36,839
there any research to show that the

980
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:40,079
effects on the plant may be lower with a

981
00:35:36,838 --> 00:35:44,358
lower viral viral load than you know

982
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:44,359
another plant for example

983
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:49,920
because to say a plant in fact it

984
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:52,140
doesn't really speak to what level of

985
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,480
infection we have right I mean

986
00:35:52,139 --> 00:35:56,338
yeah yeah so the level of infection

987
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,960
definitely would correlate with um

988
00:35:56,338 --> 00:35:59,279
typically correlates with symptoms of

989
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:02,338
disease

990
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,960
um so yeah higher viral loads

991
00:36:02,338 --> 00:36:05,639
so okay so this goes back to that

992
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,960
genotype environment thing

993
00:36:05,639 --> 00:36:09,719
um and that's sort of where we're trying

994
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:11,159
to learn more about various genotypes

995
00:36:09,719 --> 00:36:12,439
are they more susceptible to higher

996
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:15,000
loads of virus

997
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:16,440
uh or thyroid

998
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,739
um and the environment what triggers

999
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:21,119
cause that proliferation of the thyroid

1000
00:36:18,739 --> 00:36:23,959
the more that's present the more likely

1001
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:26,579
you're going to get symptoms so there's

1002
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:29,220
basically the way that this is likely

1003
00:36:26,579 --> 00:36:32,940
affecting the plant is the sequence of

1004
00:36:29,219 --> 00:36:34,858
the viroid is matching a sequence of

1005
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:37,139
genes that are being turned on in the

1006
00:36:34,858 --> 00:36:39,119
plant and when those two things match it

1007
00:36:37,139 --> 00:36:42,299
can get targeted for degradation so it's

1008
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:44,700
basically turning off genes

1009
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:46,619
um so the more the thyroid is present

1010
00:36:44,699 --> 00:36:48,179
the more likely is to turn off some of

1011
00:36:46,619 --> 00:36:51,300
those genes that result in some of those

1012
00:36:48,179 --> 00:36:55,078
symptoms of of stunting and and reduced

1013
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:57,359
potency and flowering so yeah viral load

1014
00:36:55,079 --> 00:37:01,260
should correlate with disease symptoms

1015
00:36:57,358 --> 00:37:03,779
but as far as what kind of data we have

1016
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:05,400
um it's somewhat

1017
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:08,339
somewhat limited

1018
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:10,858
um the way that we do our testing it's

1019
00:37:08,338 --> 00:37:12,420
not going to be fully quantitative so to

1020
00:37:10,858 --> 00:37:15,960
get quantitative results you have to

1021
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:18,119
purify like highly purify the RNA

1022
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:19,980
and then you have to quantify the RNA

1023
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:22,260
all those things cost money

1024
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:23,940
making it not really affordable for just

1025
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:25,500
the typical grower to quantify and

1026
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:29,240
honestly if you have the viroid you have

1027
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:32,460
thyroid and if it's low high

1028
00:37:29,239 --> 00:37:33,719
it doesn't really matter as far as what

1029
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:35,820
your next steps are going to be of

1030
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:36,899
getting rid of the viroid

1031
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:38,519
um so

1032
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:41,220
the quantification of some of these

1033
00:37:38,519 --> 00:37:42,838
things I've sort of left that uh

1034
00:37:41,219 --> 00:37:45,659
that's more in the academic side of

1035
00:37:42,838 --> 00:37:48,059
things rather than robust you know

1036
00:37:45,659 --> 00:37:48,899
testing methods for clients

1037
00:37:48,059 --> 00:37:50,639
um

1038
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:52,079
so yeah as far as the quantity of the

1039
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:53,159
viroid it will correlate with disease

1040
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:56,539
symptoms

1041
00:37:53,159 --> 00:37:59,460
yeah I think of it more of how of of

1042
00:37:56,539 --> 00:38:01,079
viral load management or viroid

1043
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:03,358
management because in a lot of these

1044
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:06,420
facilities that we work with

1045
00:38:03,358 --> 00:38:09,179
um it doesn't necessarily feel realistic

1046
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:10,700
to try and completely eradicate it or if

1047
00:38:09,179 --> 00:38:12,960
that's even possible

1048
00:38:10,699 --> 00:38:15,118
especially because a lot of the The

1049
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:17,880
Growers that we work with are reusing

1050
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:21,539
their media at which adds a whole

1051
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:24,000
another layer of of challenges so like

1052
00:38:21,539 --> 00:38:26,820
for example at Mako Farms they um

1053
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:29,400
they're growing in these these soil beds

1054
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:31,740
that are not leaving the flowering room

1055
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:33,720
so if we know it's in that in that

1056
00:38:31,739 --> 00:38:34,858
flowering room in that soil in that

1057
00:38:33,719 --> 00:38:36,118
media

1058
00:38:34,858 --> 00:38:37,679
um

1059
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:40,500
done

1060
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:41,940
it's it's not going anywhere I guess and

1061
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:43,139
so it's more about management at that

1062
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:45,720
point unless they want to you know

1063
00:38:43,139 --> 00:38:47,759
replace all the soil or or do something

1064
00:38:45,719 --> 00:38:50,159
like that but that's you know for a lot

1065
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:52,740
of Growers that may not be realistic or

1066
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:54,960
practical from financially

1067
00:38:52,739 --> 00:38:57,838
um so that led me to what sort of

1068
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:59,760
cultural practices can we adopt to

1069
00:38:57,838 --> 00:39:02,699
reduce viral load such things as

1070
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:04,800
removing as much root mass when we go to

1071
00:39:02,699 --> 00:39:07,439
harvest as possible versus leaving that

1072
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:10,320
root mass in would that potentially

1073
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:13,139
reduce the amount of thyroid presence in

1074
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:14,579
that media does that make sense yeah

1075
00:39:13,139 --> 00:39:15,480
yeah it does make sense that makes a lot

1076
00:39:14,579 --> 00:39:16,680
of sense

1077
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:18,599
um so yeah you're right when you're

1078
00:39:16,679 --> 00:39:20,940
using living soil and you're you're you

1079
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:22,440
want that those nutrients back in the

1080
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:25,380
soil

1081
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:27,059
um most certainly the more we learn

1082
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:28,619
about management practices certain you

1083
00:39:27,059 --> 00:39:30,599
know genotypes that may be more

1084
00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:32,519
resistant to actually seeing the pheno

1085
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:33,780
you know the the disease symptoms

1086
00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:35,639
um the more we learn about environmental

1087
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:38,220
triggers those are obviously going to be

1088
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:41,159
really important for those grows as far

1089
00:39:38,219 --> 00:39:43,139
as trying to maintain the same media the

1090
00:39:41,159 --> 00:39:45,960
same soils I would agree with you that

1091
00:39:43,139 --> 00:39:47,759
removing root mass is probably one of

1092
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:50,159
the best steps you can take because the

1093
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,599
more root mass is the more wire that's

1094
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:52,500
going to be there

1095
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:55,140
um

1096
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:57,239
so yeah that is one very you know

1097
00:39:55,139 --> 00:39:58,379
practical step that you could take

1098
00:39:57,239 --> 00:40:00,059
um it's unfortunate because obviously

1099
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:02,039
you'd like to keep sort of some of that

1100
00:40:00,059 --> 00:40:03,539
in the media

1101
00:40:02,039 --> 00:40:05,460
um but yeah I mean it's really all you

1102
00:40:03,539 --> 00:40:07,320
can do right so

1103
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:09,900
um as far as those kind of management

1104
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:14,460
practices removing the infected material

1105
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:16,680
is is probably the best you can do uh

1106
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:18,019
and then from there you know I mean

1107
00:40:16,679 --> 00:40:20,159
there's not

1108
00:40:18,019 --> 00:40:21,480
as far as suppressing actual

1109
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:23,159
transmission suppressing actual

1110
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,780
proliferation there's nothing that I

1111
00:40:23,159 --> 00:40:27,420
know of at this moment that could

1112
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:30,660
prevent you know the transmission to a

1113
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:32,220
new round of plants in that media

1114
00:40:30,659 --> 00:40:34,199
um and going back you know the heat

1115
00:40:32,219 --> 00:40:36,598
treatment is not applicable so it's it

1116
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:38,159
at this point I don't know how else you

1117
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:39,660
would be able to sterilize that Media or

1118
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:41,639
just prevent infection so as far as

1119
00:40:39,659 --> 00:40:42,960
management practices I think yeah maybe

1120
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:44,578
the only practical thing you can do is

1121
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,260
remove some of that root mass after that

1122
00:40:44,579 --> 00:40:48,480
those plants are Harvest

1123
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:50,400
um and then starting with clean genetics

1124
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,199
you know when you when you reset you

1125
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,700
know if you can if you're able to reset

1126
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:55,019
and just starting with things that are

1127
00:40:53,699 --> 00:40:57,598
clean

1128
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:59,039
um as far as natural transmission uh

1129
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:03,119
we're still working on some of those

1130
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:04,800
methods you know I mean so presumably

1131
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:06,920
um insects that have piercing and

1132
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:10,140
sucking mouth Parts you know thrips

1133
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:12,059
and aphids potentially could spread hot

1134
00:41:10,139 --> 00:41:13,679
blatant but where they would get that

1135
00:41:12,059 --> 00:41:16,199
from if you have a you know if you have

1136
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:19,159
a farm it's all clean stock that is

1137
00:41:16,199 --> 00:41:20,699
still an unknown right so

1138
00:41:19,159 --> 00:41:23,819
Maybe

1139
00:41:20,699 --> 00:41:25,319
introduced naturally or outside

1140
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:27,359
um

1141
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:29,460
is still not something we have data on

1142
00:41:27,358 --> 00:41:30,659
so if you started with a you know if

1143
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:32,940
you're doing living soil you start with

1144
00:41:30,659 --> 00:41:35,519
clean stock start with clean media and

1145
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:36,900
then you'll be hopefully you'll be safe

1146
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:38,099
for a while

1147
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:39,838
um because I don't know of how else

1148
00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:42,900
you'd introduce it into your crop so

1149
00:41:39,838 --> 00:41:45,179
that's well let's just say we know in a

1150
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:46,619
facility so I know I keep throwing my

1151
00:41:45,179 --> 00:41:47,519
buddy Justin under the bus in this

1152
00:41:46,619 --> 00:41:49,260
podcast

1153
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:50,940
but he's been the best case for us in

1154
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:53,820
working through this so

1155
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:55,380
um if we know we have clean stock

1156
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:57,359
because we tested

1157
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:59,280
um and we know we have clean mothers we

1158
00:41:57,358 --> 00:42:02,460
know we have an infected flower room

1159
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:05,880
where those beds have media that had

1160
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:07,260
acted you know had thyroid in there

1161
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:09,780
um

1162
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:13,140
that would be a great way to reduce

1163
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:14,460
viral load on the plants themselves so

1164
00:42:13,139 --> 00:42:16,559
knowing they're coming in clean they're

1165
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:19,980
only going to have 55 days of exposure

1166
00:42:16,559 --> 00:42:22,019
to this viroid and potentially yeah uh

1167
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:23,280
less of an impact on our final crop I

1168
00:42:22,019 --> 00:42:25,199
guess is where I'm headed with this

1169
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:26,640
correct yeah correct

1170
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:28,019
um yeah and so going back to the

1171
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:30,838
previous study that we had done where we

1172
00:42:28,019 --> 00:42:32,699
took cuttings off of a positive mom and

1173
00:42:30,838 --> 00:42:33,838
those cuttings stayed positive for six

1174
00:42:32,699 --> 00:42:35,578
months

1175
00:42:33,838 --> 00:42:37,980
um and then I think only one or two came

1176
00:42:35,579 --> 00:42:40,200
back positive later after that

1177
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:41,940
yes so if you go in with clean stock

1178
00:42:40,199 --> 00:42:44,639
it'll stay clean for those that that

1179
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:47,099
Harvest that 55-day Harvest I

1180
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:49,319
maybe maybe some get infected but it

1181
00:42:47,099 --> 00:42:51,480
would be minimal

1182
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:53,099
um as far as what I've seen so yeah if

1183
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:55,380
you're going in with clean stock even if

1184
00:42:53,099 --> 00:42:56,760
it's going into that infected soil while

1185
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:58,980
they may get infected they may not show

1186
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:02,280
symptoms uh and that viral load is

1187
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:03,719
correlated with that so as far as

1188
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:05,040
management practices if you're able to

1189
00:43:03,719 --> 00:43:06,539
yeah if that's if that's a practical

1190
00:43:05,039 --> 00:43:08,639
solution for you yes that would help

1191
00:43:06,539 --> 00:43:11,279
reduce the viral load and subsequent

1192
00:43:08,639 --> 00:43:12,838
symptoms and bad Harvest

1193
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,700
but we would want to be careful then

1194
00:43:12,838 --> 00:43:16,980
when we're harvesting not to go back

1195
00:43:14,699 --> 00:43:21,000
through any vegetative spaces or have

1196
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:24,659
any contact with vegetative plants

1197
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:28,019
um just to reduce that

1198
00:43:24,659 --> 00:43:32,279
potentially circling around right

1199
00:43:28,019 --> 00:43:34,559
or is that nice in your in your eyes

1200
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:35,220
well okay so if you're asking you to

1201
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:37,078
make sure I understand the question

1202
00:43:35,219 --> 00:43:39,179
correctly um so if you're planning on

1203
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:42,300
making a new generation of plants from

1204
00:43:39,179 --> 00:43:44,279
that set no so is that plants coming

1205
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:46,140
into the flower room are clean we go to

1206
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:48,720
but once they're in the flower room

1207
00:43:46,139 --> 00:43:50,578
let's say they're now infected or dirty

1208
00:43:48,719 --> 00:43:52,980
we want to make sure that that Harvest

1209
00:43:50,579 --> 00:43:56,700
is going out a separate way not coming

1210
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:59,039
back through our our veg space

1211
00:43:56,699 --> 00:44:00,838
um or our cloning space yeah um and so

1212
00:43:59,039 --> 00:44:02,400
just people should have Sops around that

1213
00:44:00,838 --> 00:44:03,539
making sure that we're keeping things as

1214
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:07,318
clean as possible and that would be good

1215
00:44:03,539 --> 00:44:08,159
for any viroid or pathogen or pest in

1216
00:44:07,318 --> 00:44:11,039
general

1217
00:44:08,159 --> 00:44:12,598
um just as best right best practice so

1218
00:44:11,039 --> 00:44:14,579
yeah no absolutely

1219
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:16,440
um yeah so keeping that chain

1220
00:44:14,579 --> 00:44:19,440
um moving One Direction

1221
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:22,440
um even with cured dried flour uh yeah

1222
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:25,260
it should not ever come back to those

1223
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:27,300
earlier stages of growth

1224
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:28,859
so one thing we haven't really talked

1225
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:30,900
about in this podcast I know we've

1226
00:44:28,858 --> 00:44:32,400
covered it in Prior podcasts and most

1227
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:35,160
people are aware of this but we probably

1228
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:38,400
should just go over you know what some

1229
00:44:35,159 --> 00:44:40,078
of the more common symptoms are with uh

1230
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:42,900
hop late and viroid

1231
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:45,420
um do you want to start it off and I can

1232
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:46,680
add on anything that because there's a

1233
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:48,300
lot

1234
00:44:46,679 --> 00:44:51,239
it is a lot

1235
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:53,339
um so the loose buds okay so we'll start

1236
00:44:51,239 --> 00:44:54,838
with flour because that's really you

1237
00:44:53,338 --> 00:44:57,239
know I mean that's sort of one of the

1238
00:44:54,838 --> 00:44:58,619
Hallmarks uh is the dudding so if you

1239
00:44:57,239 --> 00:45:00,118
don't have flour at all I mean that's

1240
00:44:58,619 --> 00:45:02,940
the worst case scenario but then loose

1241
00:45:00,119 --> 00:45:06,980
flour uh so often it's called larfy buds

1242
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:09,119
so not nice tight not nice type flowers

1243
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:11,519
smaller yields

1244
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:13,920
often I mean there are so I think Dr

1245
00:45:11,519 --> 00:45:15,300
punja has found that that apical Branch

1246
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,619
sometimes I have smaller Buds and

1247
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:19,019
sometimes the secondary branches will

1248
00:45:16,619 --> 00:45:20,640
have one that looks more normal

1249
00:45:19,019 --> 00:45:22,920
um if it affects the plant earlier and

1250
00:45:20,639 --> 00:45:26,159
you get full on stunting then the plant

1251
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:27,900
that apical Branch will start to to

1252
00:45:26,159 --> 00:45:29,639
basically slow growth and the side

1253
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:31,380
branches will come up so you get sort of

1254
00:45:29,639 --> 00:45:33,659
a trident looking plant

1255
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:36,358
or a candelabra

1256
00:45:33,659 --> 00:45:38,639
um so lots of lateral growth brittle

1257
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:40,739
stems so if you just walk by and hit one

1258
00:45:38,639 --> 00:45:42,358
and it just flops off the plant that's a

1259
00:45:40,739 --> 00:45:44,818
really serious symptom so that's that's

1260
00:45:42,358 --> 00:45:46,739
a Hallmark of hot blade and

1261
00:45:44,818 --> 00:45:48,960
um there's some correlation with Leaf

1262
00:45:46,739 --> 00:45:50,539
morphology so we are seeing some

1263
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,980
interesting leaf

1264
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:56,219
phenotypes that I had not previously

1265
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:58,679
known as associated with top latent

1266
00:45:56,219 --> 00:46:00,779
um some people have yellow yellow leaves

1267
00:45:58,679 --> 00:46:03,179
towards the crown

1268
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:04,920
um and then the main one is your coas so

1269
00:46:03,179 --> 00:46:06,659
that way if you have asymptomatic plants

1270
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:09,000
but your coas are dropping you know

1271
00:46:06,659 --> 00:46:11,098
Harvest by Harvest and that can also be

1272
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,800
a sign that something's going on uh

1273
00:46:11,099 --> 00:46:15,599
regarding hot blatance to the potency

1274
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:17,519
the reduction in potency it can be

1275
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:20,160
severe you know it can be like 50 or

1276
00:46:17,519 --> 00:46:22,079
more um so those kind of things are all

1277
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:24,598
Hallmarks

1278
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:26,940
um some anecdotal ones some poor rooting

1279
00:46:24,599 --> 00:46:28,859
so in clones uh if you're getting really

1280
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:32,460
poor rooting that can actually be a

1281
00:46:28,858 --> 00:46:33,900
symptom that we've noticed uh given

1282
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:35,460
where we're finding the viroid that's

1283
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:37,559
not really too surprising so some of

1284
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:39,059
that can actually be seen early in in

1285
00:46:37,559 --> 00:46:40,858
when you're rooting clones and so those

1286
00:46:39,059 --> 00:46:42,239
would be probably the main ones that

1287
00:46:40,858 --> 00:46:44,338
come to mind

1288
00:46:42,239 --> 00:46:45,779
you got all the ones that I had from the

1289
00:46:44,338 --> 00:46:48,659
presentation I was going to add to it

1290
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:52,319
but I think you nailed them all the one

1291
00:46:48,659 --> 00:46:54,598
other thing would be that you may also

1292
00:46:52,318 --> 00:46:57,239
have increased susceptibility if you

1293
00:46:54,599 --> 00:46:58,920
have a hop blatant positive plant to

1294
00:46:57,239 --> 00:47:01,519
other

1295
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:04,680
pathogens go ahead

1296
00:47:01,519 --> 00:47:06,599
yeah yeah so this is this is um so as I

1297
00:47:04,679 --> 00:47:07,980
mentioned um Dr punj has been in this

1298
00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:09,420
field for a long you know in the field

1299
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:11,460
of campus and have been in lots of other

1300
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:13,380
pathogens uh mind you but um and

1301
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:15,358
different crops too but um specific to

1302
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:18,660
his research in cannabis and ham

1303
00:47:15,358 --> 00:47:21,420
um fungal pathogens uh he is

1304
00:47:18,659 --> 00:47:22,920
just a worldwide expert on that um and

1305
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:24,180
what he has found is that there is an

1306
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:25,500
increased susceptibility to things like

1307
00:47:24,179 --> 00:47:27,598
fusarium

1308
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:29,280
um and other root pathogens

1309
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:30,838
uh when you have a hot blade and fire

1310
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:32,819
infection

1311
00:47:30,838 --> 00:47:36,599
um so it sort of can spiral out of

1312
00:47:32,818 --> 00:47:38,460
control right so and this is pretty sort

1313
00:47:36,599 --> 00:47:39,720
of a general rule that when the plants

1314
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:40,679
are diseased with one thing it kind of

1315
00:47:39,719 --> 00:47:41,759
leaves them susceptible to other

1316
00:47:40,679 --> 00:47:43,379
diseases

1317
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:46,260
um and that's just sort of you know it

1318
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:48,180
can only fight so many things at once

1319
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:51,420
um

1320
00:47:48,179 --> 00:47:53,219
okay I hate to bring this into it but

1321
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:55,500
there is some evidence and we don't have

1322
00:47:53,219 --> 00:47:58,318
this in cannabis yet but there is some

1323
00:47:55,500 --> 00:48:00,659
evidence that these viroids

1324
00:47:58,318 --> 00:48:02,940
um specifically hops done thyroid and a

1325
00:48:00,659 --> 00:48:06,539
few other viroids can actually replicate

1326
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:07,380
in some fungi So like fusarium

1327
00:48:06,539 --> 00:48:09,838
um and then they can actually

1328
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:11,400
horizontally transmit but we don't have

1329
00:48:09,838 --> 00:48:12,960
that as evidence for cannabis yet so I

1330
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:15,420
really want to make sure that big

1331
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:17,818
disclaimer is there but there is some

1332
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:20,280
very interesting research going on uh so

1333
00:48:17,818 --> 00:48:22,019
right now there's 33 viroid species out

1334
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:24,180
in the world that we know of I think

1335
00:48:22,019 --> 00:48:25,858
three of them have been shown to have

1336
00:48:24,179 --> 00:48:27,779
horizontal transmission with various

1337
00:48:25,858 --> 00:48:29,639
fungi

1338
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:32,700
um we don't have any data for hobbling

1339
00:48:29,639 --> 00:48:34,318
on that yet but um it is an interesting

1340
00:48:32,699 --> 00:48:35,939
sort of

1341
00:48:34,318 --> 00:48:37,920
you know natural transmission

1342
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:40,019
possibility

1343
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:43,019
um that that these things could actually

1344
00:48:40,019 --> 00:48:45,300
be replicated uh in a fungi and just

1345
00:48:43,019 --> 00:48:47,039
kept alive and a fungi and then you know

1346
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:51,060
be transmitted horizontally that way

1347
00:48:47,039 --> 00:48:53,400
which would be not fun not a fun way so

1348
00:48:51,059 --> 00:48:54,960
so I'm sure there's going to be more

1349
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:57,539
research coming out

1350
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:59,760
um sooner than later because this is

1351
00:48:57,539 --> 00:49:02,400
such a devastating uh

1352
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:04,560
devastating disease and I do hope to get

1353
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:06,300
Dr punja on the show eventually he's

1354
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:07,799
just been really busy

1355
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:09,720
um but I know I know you're in contact

1356
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:12,180
with him and you did a virtual

1357
00:49:09,719 --> 00:49:14,818
introduction for me which I appreciate

1358
00:49:12,179 --> 00:49:17,039
um yeah but in the meantime

1359
00:49:14,818 --> 00:49:18,480
um while we're you know until we get

1360
00:49:17,039 --> 00:49:22,199
more research I feel like you covered

1361
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:25,380
that all pretty well what other viruses

1362
00:49:22,199 --> 00:49:27,719
are you really seeing or other pathogens

1363
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:29,280
as being more prevalent in your lab with

1364
00:49:27,719 --> 00:49:31,439
the testing that you're doing in

1365
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:35,160
cannabis specifically

1366
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:37,740
yeah I mean so we do really broad range

1367
00:49:35,159 --> 00:49:39,598
path and detection as far as viruses are

1368
00:49:37,739 --> 00:49:41,699
concerned so the things that affect a

1369
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:44,160
lot of crops you know the mosaics like

1370
00:49:41,699 --> 00:49:46,618
Alfalfa and cucumber Mosaic and and

1371
00:49:44,159 --> 00:49:49,500
tomato Mosaic those aren't that common

1372
00:49:46,619 --> 00:49:52,140
we find those very rarely

1373
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:54,000
um they can infect cannabis but

1374
00:49:52,139 --> 00:49:55,858
typically I only recommend those on a

1375
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,579
case-by-case basis

1376
00:49:55,858 --> 00:49:59,699
um

1377
00:49:56,579 --> 00:50:02,220
the main ones that are more more

1378
00:49:59,699 --> 00:50:06,299
prevalent would be beat curly top virus

1379
00:50:02,219 --> 00:50:09,598
now that's more outdoor grows

1380
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:10,760
um so Dr punya nachapa at Colorado State

1381
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:13,140
University

1382
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:16,920
really great research on be curly top

1383
00:50:13,139 --> 00:50:19,318
virus the Southwest is where the natural

1384
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:22,680
transmission Vector overwinters so

1385
00:50:19,318 --> 00:50:23,940
that's beet Leaf Hoppers they typically

1386
00:50:22,679 --> 00:50:25,919
they're the overwinter in like New

1387
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:27,960
Mexico and then they travel up into

1388
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:29,880
Colorado so that's outdoor grows really

1389
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:32,338
susceptible to be curly top I have seen

1390
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:35,160
it as I have seen in Washington

1391
00:50:32,338 --> 00:50:37,259
um and that's not unusual uh beet you

1392
00:50:35,159 --> 00:50:39,899
know sugar beets are affected by beet

1393
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:41,880
curly top in Washington and Oregon so

1394
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:43,680
um that is a possibility so beat curly

1395
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:45,660
top the symptoms there's three different

1396
00:50:43,679 --> 00:50:48,058
strains of beet curly top and it can

1397
00:50:45,659 --> 00:50:49,379
range in severity so the symptoms can be

1398
00:50:48,059 --> 00:50:50,640
a little different depending on what

1399
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:53,579
type of strain you got the one that I

1400
00:50:50,639 --> 00:50:56,338
saw was really twisted growth

1401
00:50:53,579 --> 00:50:58,500
um swollen leaf veins and the leaf pulls

1402
00:50:56,338 --> 00:51:00,358
down like there's a drawstring in it and

1403
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:03,239
the the branches curl so the symptoms

1404
00:51:00,358 --> 00:51:04,619
can be really Stark on that one and it

1405
00:51:03,239 --> 00:51:06,479
may only affect one part of the plant so

1406
00:51:04,619 --> 00:51:07,800
this plant it was like one branch was

1407
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:10,139
all curled and then everything else is

1408
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:12,240
fine but um you can detect be curly top

1409
00:51:10,139 --> 00:51:14,639
anywhere

1410
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:18,118
um so that one is one to watch out for

1411
00:51:14,639 --> 00:51:20,039
and I mean that one I don't think

1412
00:51:18,119 --> 00:51:22,019
um the data so far says it's not

1413
00:51:20,039 --> 00:51:24,659
mechanically transmitted uh it's a

1414
00:51:22,019 --> 00:51:26,880
dna-based plant virus which is the

1415
00:51:24,659 --> 00:51:28,980
smaller most plant viruses are RNA based

1416
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:31,079
dna-based plant viruses only account for

1417
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:33,300
about 25

1418
00:51:31,079 --> 00:51:36,960
um and I think that its life cycle needs

1419
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:40,700
it doesn't mechanically transfer well so

1420
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:43,139
um that one's not as big of a piano a

1421
00:51:40,699 --> 00:51:44,639
spread problem

1422
00:51:43,139 --> 00:51:46,259
um but outdoor grows yeah I should be

1423
00:51:44,639 --> 00:51:48,299
worried about that lettuce chlorosis

1424
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:49,920
virus is another one uh originally

1425
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:51,960
lettuce sclerosis virus was identified

1426
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:54,300
in lettuce in California

1427
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:56,159
um but it was found in cannabis facility

1428
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:59,579
in a really well done peer-reviewed

1429
00:51:56,159 --> 00:52:02,338
article uh I think in 2017 or 2019 from

1430
00:51:59,579 --> 00:52:05,300
uh I believe was Israel

1431
00:52:02,338 --> 00:52:08,099
but yeah they um have symptoms of

1432
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:10,318
chlorosis so yellow plants

1433
00:52:08,099 --> 00:52:12,359
um produce the yield stunting typical

1434
00:52:10,318 --> 00:52:14,880
with most viruses stunting is kind of a

1435
00:52:12,358 --> 00:52:16,920
common theme weird morphology things so

1436
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:18,358
those would be the two that I think a

1437
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:20,818
lot of people look to test for speak

1438
00:52:18,358 --> 00:52:22,679
really top lettuce sclerosis virus

1439
00:52:20,818 --> 00:52:24,420
um so far no symptoms have been

1440
00:52:22,679 --> 00:52:27,000
correlated with tobacco mosaic virus

1441
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:28,440
even though people you know you might go

1442
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:31,139
on online forums and people might

1443
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:33,780
suggest that it can infect cannabis but

1444
00:52:31,139 --> 00:52:35,219
the peer-reviewed Articles and it's an

1445
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:37,079
old one admittedly

1446
00:52:35,219 --> 00:52:38,578
um but the studies where they've

1447
00:52:37,079 --> 00:52:40,579
infected cannabis there's no symptoms

1448
00:52:38,579 --> 00:52:43,800
for tobacco and mosaic

1449
00:52:40,579 --> 00:52:45,240
cannabis cryptic virus the name implies

1450
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:47,339
that it actually doesn't do anything so

1451
00:52:45,239 --> 00:52:48,719
cryptic we give that to viruses that

1452
00:52:47,338 --> 00:52:50,338
it's there but it doesn't actually cause

1453
00:52:48,719 --> 00:52:52,078
symptoms so people might tell you

1454
00:52:50,338 --> 00:52:52,980
cannabis cryptic is an issue we can test

1455
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:55,079
for it

1456
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:57,539
currently there's no strong correlation

1457
00:52:55,079 --> 00:52:58,980
with that and symptoms

1458
00:52:57,539 --> 00:53:00,300
um and there is a really good also

1459
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:02,159
peer-reviewed article on cannabis

1460
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:06,720
cryptic virus done I want to say

1461
00:53:02,159 --> 00:53:09,480
2019-2020 where they sort of they were

1462
00:53:06,719 --> 00:53:11,338
trying to figure out the cause of uh

1463
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:12,659
what appeared to be hemp streak I think

1464
00:53:11,338 --> 00:53:14,519
it was or hemos it was either hemp

1465
00:53:12,659 --> 00:53:16,440
streak or hemosaic it's a hemp streak

1466
00:53:14,519 --> 00:53:17,579
virus and hem mosaic virus those aren't

1467
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:19,200
actually we don't know what those are

1468
00:53:17,579 --> 00:53:20,818
those are just symptoms that have been

1469
00:53:19,199 --> 00:53:22,259
seen on plants that have been then given

1470
00:53:20,818 --> 00:53:23,579
a disease name but no one's ever figured

1471
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:25,319
out what the disease is like no one's

1472
00:53:23,579 --> 00:53:26,700
figured out the cause for those so they

1473
00:53:25,318 --> 00:53:28,440
went looking for the cause of hemp

1474
00:53:26,699 --> 00:53:30,058
streak all they found was Cannabis

1475
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:31,559
cryptic virus and it didn't correlate

1476
00:53:30,059 --> 00:53:32,819
like every time they it didn't correlate

1477
00:53:31,559 --> 00:53:34,619
with symptoms sometimes they would see

1478
00:53:32,818 --> 00:53:36,779
it with symptoms sometimes without and

1479
00:53:34,619 --> 00:53:38,940
so as we know it now cannabis cryptic

1480
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:40,260
doesn't cause symptoms it's not to say

1481
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:42,119
that we won't find some correlation

1482
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:43,079
later maybe with specific genotypes or

1483
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:45,838
something

1484
00:53:43,079 --> 00:53:48,660
um but that's one we can test for but so

1485
00:53:45,838 --> 00:53:50,219
far no symptoms from that so the ones

1486
00:53:48,659 --> 00:53:53,578
that are really you know I mean top

1487
00:53:50,219 --> 00:53:55,318
latent Far and Away be curly top if you

1488
00:53:53,579 --> 00:53:57,480
have symptoms that are reminiscent

1489
00:53:55,318 --> 00:53:58,800
lettuce sclerosis those would be the

1490
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:01,920
main ones

1491
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:04,619
then there's one more that

1492
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:05,818
I don't want to get too far ahead and I

1493
00:54:04,619 --> 00:54:07,740
don't want to I don't want to be

1494
00:54:05,818 --> 00:54:10,858
alarmist

1495
00:54:07,739 --> 00:54:12,899
um it's cannabis mitovirus one

1496
00:54:10,858 --> 00:54:14,818
I've been finding it I've been testing a

1497
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:18,119
lot of samples in the background

1498
00:54:14,818 --> 00:54:21,000
um just as a sort of uh figure out it's

1499
00:54:18,119 --> 00:54:22,858
really prevalent really really prevalent

1500
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,358
um we're talking on the scale of you

1501
00:54:22,858 --> 00:54:25,858
know it's probably similar prevalence

1502
00:54:24,358 --> 00:54:28,019
just to something as like hop late and

1503
00:54:25,858 --> 00:54:29,639
viroid but again this is one that we

1504
00:54:28,019 --> 00:54:31,380
don't think at this moment there's no

1505
00:54:29,639 --> 00:54:33,659
evidence to say it causes symptoms so a

1506
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:36,300
cannabis mitovirus it's a virus that

1507
00:54:33,659 --> 00:54:39,719
proliferates in the mitochondria

1508
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:43,318
um mitoviruses in general are sort of an

1509
00:54:39,719 --> 00:54:44,699
emerging research area I think a lot of

1510
00:54:43,318 --> 00:54:46,199
the research this is one of those things

1511
00:54:44,699 --> 00:54:47,460
that we started finding now that we have

1512
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:49,199
all these next-gen sequencing

1513
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:52,920
Technologies and we're able to assemble

1514
00:54:49,199 --> 00:54:55,618
these tiny genomes from scratch and

1515
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:57,180
we've been finding more of them so the

1516
00:54:55,619 --> 00:55:00,000
research is very early and not just

1517
00:54:57,179 --> 00:55:01,919
cannabis like all myodviruses the

1518
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,900
research is pretty early the only one

1519
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:06,480
that has any sort of empirical data is

1520
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:08,579
one that affects quinoa plants they

1521
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:10,199
don't find symptoms but they they have

1522
00:55:08,579 --> 00:55:12,420
found a correlation with increased

1523
00:55:10,199 --> 00:55:15,419
immune response so the plants are more

1524
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:17,880
ready to to to fight off other

1525
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:18,960
infections because it primes the immune

1526
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:21,539
response

1527
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:23,460
so that's a lot of info um

1528
00:55:21,539 --> 00:55:25,500
cannabis minovirus is probably prevalent

1529
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:28,559
in a lot of cannabis crops but as of now

1530
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:30,358
we don't think it causes issues maybe

1531
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:32,579
that changes maybe we correlate some

1532
00:55:30,358 --> 00:55:33,779
symptom with it as of now it's not

1533
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:35,640
something I'm like going out there and

1534
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:38,519
telling people oh they got to test for

1535
00:55:35,639 --> 00:55:41,219
um so that's sort of the lay of the land

1536
00:55:38,519 --> 00:55:43,019
the generic viruses are less common and

1537
00:55:41,219 --> 00:55:44,699
then yeah it's Top Lane far and away is

1538
00:55:43,019 --> 00:55:46,739
the one you need to be worried about be

1539
00:55:44,699 --> 00:55:48,379
curly top for outdoor Growers lettuce

1540
00:55:46,739 --> 00:55:49,919
sclerosis

1541
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:53,760
intermittently

1542
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:55,440
um and then the Cannabis mitavirus one

1543
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:58,740
but that's not something you need to

1544
00:55:55,440 --> 00:56:01,800
test for it's just probably there

1545
00:55:58,739 --> 00:56:05,039
Dr punja gave some prevalence

1546
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:06,720
numbers but I I don't want to misspeak

1547
00:56:05,039 --> 00:56:10,558
because I don't I didn't write that down

1548
00:56:06,719 --> 00:56:12,719
do you remember seeing it yeah so he's

1549
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:14,819
seen it around 90 of the samples he's

1550
00:56:12,719 --> 00:56:18,838
looked at have cannabis minovirus I'm

1551
00:56:14,818 --> 00:56:21,000
seeing more two-thirds ish oh but these

1552
00:56:18,838 --> 00:56:22,380
are probably differences in sampling at

1553
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:27,000
this time

1554
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:28,079
um I was thinking sorry oh hot Bladen uh

1555
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,900
prevalence

1556
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:33,300
um yeah so that one

1557
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:34,920
the numbers are so I sort of think of

1558
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:37,318
facilities because once a facility is

1559
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:38,760
infected it's sort of you got to make

1560
00:56:37,318 --> 00:56:40,139
sure that your facility is clean and

1561
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:42,540
it's not spreading so facilities we're

1562
00:56:40,139 --> 00:56:44,400
seeing it in like 90 of facilities and

1563
00:56:42,539 --> 00:56:45,719
uh I can't remember what Dr punj's

1564
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,920
numbers are on this so that one I don't

1565
00:56:45,719 --> 00:56:47,759
want to I don't want to stay off the

1566
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:48,599
cuff

1567
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:50,520
um

1568
00:56:48,599 --> 00:56:52,619
the

1569
00:56:50,519 --> 00:56:54,480
prevalence is

1570
00:56:52,619 --> 00:56:56,400
yeah for us we're seeing it in like 90

1571
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:57,599
of facilities and and the ones that

1572
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,380
we're not seeing it in sometimes it

1573
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:59,880
might just be because they're not

1574
00:56:58,380 --> 00:57:00,720
sampling enough like it's a few plants

1575
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:02,460
here

1576
00:57:00,719 --> 00:57:05,519
um and it's not sort of a robust testing

1577
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:07,500
strategy so it's highly prevalent

1578
00:57:05,519 --> 00:57:09,358
um but as far as the number on cultivars

1579
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:11,159
I don't have that off top my head

1580
00:57:09,358 --> 00:57:13,199
yeah I don't remember either I remember

1581
00:57:11,159 --> 00:57:15,179
he threw out like the num the percentage

1582
00:57:13,199 --> 00:57:17,818
in Canada that was infected and it was

1583
00:57:15,179 --> 00:57:19,919
that he suspected was infected and it

1584
00:57:17,818 --> 00:57:22,079
was I remember it was over 50 because I

1585
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:23,818
was shocked by it um yeah how high oh

1586
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:25,619
yeah I can't remember off the top of my

1587
00:57:23,818 --> 00:57:27,480
head so I don't want to yeah I don't

1588
00:57:25,619 --> 00:57:30,660
want to misspeak but

1589
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:32,338
um it appears to be everywhere

1590
00:57:30,659 --> 00:57:34,679
oh and that's see that's why I like to

1591
00:57:32,338 --> 00:57:37,318
think of it as facilities because yeah

1592
00:57:34,679 --> 00:57:39,838
it is everywhere one but two it's like

1593
00:57:37,318 --> 00:57:41,759
um if you were to say okay 50 of

1594
00:57:39,838 --> 00:57:44,219
cultivars in Canada have it or or

1595
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:45,960
America or whatever

1596
00:57:44,219 --> 00:57:47,639
um how many facilities is that because

1597
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:49,079
once it's in a facility it can be

1598
00:57:47,639 --> 00:57:51,118
transmit to all you know it can be

1599
00:57:49,079 --> 00:57:53,099
transmit to your cultivars very quickly

1600
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:54,358
if you don't have good protocols in

1601
00:57:53,099 --> 00:57:55,380
place

1602
00:57:54,358 --> 00:57:57,420
um

1603
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:59,280
so that's why the numbers can be a

1604
00:57:57,420 --> 00:58:00,900
little bit so it's um

1605
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:03,540
it is a very large number though it is

1606
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:05,760
it's yeah it's it's uh that tracks of

1607
00:58:03,539 --> 00:58:07,800
over 50 tracks uh because once it's in a

1608
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:10,200
facility it's usually widespread

1609
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:12,180
um especially considering the data on

1610
00:58:10,199 --> 00:58:14,279
how it spreads is only just now sort of

1611
00:58:12,179 --> 00:58:16,558
getting ironed out

1612
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:18,960
um so folks may have been unwittingly

1613
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:20,640
knowing you know transmitting it the

1614
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:24,000
seed bringing seed thinking it's clean

1615
00:58:20,639 --> 00:58:26,639
uh things like that so yeah those

1616
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:28,920
numbers yeah it's probably greater than

1617
00:58:26,639 --> 00:58:31,379
50 of plants

1618
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:33,119
so one thing I wanted to just go back to

1619
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:34,559
was you mentioned

1620
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:37,858
um

1621
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:40,079
with the hemp or or campus like the leaf

1622
00:58:37,858 --> 00:58:41,039
the streaking you don't know what causes

1623
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:43,619
that

1624
00:58:41,039 --> 00:58:46,380
is that at all related to variegation or

1625
00:58:43,619 --> 00:58:49,500
is those two totally separate

1626
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:51,660
things or do you know probably separate

1627
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:52,858
things yeah probably separate things

1628
00:58:51,659 --> 00:58:55,858
um but I don't know

1629
00:58:52,858 --> 00:58:58,858
um so ham streak virus and hemp mosaic

1630
00:58:55,858 --> 00:59:00,598
virus are things that have been around

1631
00:58:58,858 --> 00:59:02,460
decades

1632
00:59:00,599 --> 00:59:05,099
um people just sort of called it that

1633
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:06,838
without it basically manifests like

1634
00:59:05,099 --> 00:59:10,440
something that looks like a virus

1635
00:59:06,838 --> 00:59:11,779
um hemp streak has Chevron like

1636
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:14,880
um

1637
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:16,380
uh check marks on the leaves and that's

1638
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:18,000
typical of something like the streak

1639
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:19,318
viruses that's a name we give to ones

1640
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,940
that have sort of a Chevron shaped

1641
00:59:19,318 --> 00:59:22,920
streak in there you know in the main

1642
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:24,599
host so tobacco Street virus in tobacco

1643
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:25,980
gives a little Chevron streak on the on

1644
00:59:24,599 --> 00:59:26,700
the leaves

1645
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:30,000
um

1646
00:59:26,699 --> 00:59:32,219
and Mosaic typical Mosaic symptoms if

1647
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:34,679
you've seen if you've looked at you know

1648
00:59:32,219 --> 00:59:36,539
online forums with people who say they

1649
00:59:34,679 --> 00:59:38,759
may have took tobacco mosaic virus

1650
00:59:36,539 --> 00:59:41,219
that's a mosaic symptom and you can see

1651
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:42,900
it so those are very clear

1652
00:59:41,219 --> 00:59:44,639
um sort of morphologies that that were

1653
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:46,019
associated with hemp streak and hemosaic

1654
00:59:44,639 --> 00:59:48,960
now we don't know what causes those

1655
00:59:46,019 --> 00:59:50,940
whether or not that's actually viral or

1656
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:52,980
we don't we just don't know and it could

1657
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:54,240
be one of these other viruses

1658
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:57,420
um but back then they didn't have the

1659
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:58,739
techniques to test and so sort of just

1660
00:59:57,420 --> 01:00:02,338
gave it a name

1661
00:59:58,739 --> 01:00:04,139
um as far as variegation goes uh

1662
01:00:02,338 --> 01:00:06,179
yeah

1663
01:00:04,139 --> 01:00:08,338
there could be things that look similar

1664
01:00:06,179 --> 01:00:10,919
to a mosaic based on a variegation like

1665
01:00:08,338 --> 01:00:12,900
sort of a somatic mutation that then is

1666
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:14,220
looks like that but variegation when I

1667
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:16,380
think of it sort of like you know if

1668
01:00:14,219 --> 01:00:18,598
somebody sends me a a leaf that's like

1669
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:20,519
half white and half green like that's a

1670
01:00:18,599 --> 01:00:22,260
really clear sort of variegated leaf and

1671
01:00:20,519 --> 01:00:24,659
that's not that's just typical sort of

1672
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:25,799
mutation that happens uh over you know

1673
01:00:24,659 --> 01:00:27,118
thousands of thousands of plants you're

1674
01:00:25,798 --> 01:00:29,280
going to get a plant that may have that

1675
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:31,700
kind of split pattern so that's not

1676
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:35,400
correlated then with any particular

1677
01:00:31,699 --> 01:00:37,739
virus or viroid that you're aware of

1678
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:39,838
that's just the normal genetics oh yeah

1679
01:00:37,739 --> 01:00:41,519
yeah it's just a normal genetic thing if

1680
01:00:39,838 --> 01:00:43,380
you were to clone off that you might

1681
01:00:41,519 --> 01:00:45,480
actually get clones that look variegated

1682
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:47,760
it's probably just a somatic mutation

1683
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:49,260
which means like a a cell that's not a

1684
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:50,940
reproductive cell that has a mutation so

1685
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:51,960
every so often these things are going to

1686
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:53,760
happen

1687
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:55,440
um the older things are you know the

1688
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:57,059
older we get the more some adaptations

1689
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:58,318
we accumulate and eventually one of

1690
01:00:57,059 --> 01:01:00,240
those may cause cancer kind of kind of

1691
01:00:58,318 --> 01:01:01,798
thing um so yeah this is just a normal

1692
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:03,058
process especially when you're cloning

1693
01:01:01,798 --> 01:01:05,219
and growing in these high growth

1694
01:01:03,059 --> 01:01:07,980
situations

1695
01:01:05,219 --> 01:01:10,439
um eventually yeah there might be a leaf

1696
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:11,940
or or even a plant that just um just

1697
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:12,599
doesn't look great

1698
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:14,760
um

1699
01:01:12,599 --> 01:01:17,160
and so that's one of those

1700
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:18,900
you know I mean there's yeah it's not

1701
01:01:17,159 --> 01:01:21,239
likely to be correlated with it okay

1702
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:23,039
last last question then uh since he

1703
01:01:21,239 --> 01:01:25,858
brought it up uh

1704
01:01:23,039 --> 01:01:28,920
the uh sort of like uh mutation over

1705
01:01:25,858 --> 01:01:32,460
time with with genetics so people talk

1706
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:33,240
about genetic drift with cloning

1707
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:35,460
um

1708
01:01:33,239 --> 01:01:37,618
I I I'm under the impression that's not

1709
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:39,720
really a thing it's more about maybe you

1710
01:01:37,619 --> 01:01:42,119
may get some small mutations that may

1711
01:01:39,719 --> 01:01:43,139
manifest over time

1712
01:01:42,119 --> 01:01:45,059
um

1713
01:01:43,139 --> 01:01:48,179
what are your thoughts on that and then

1714
01:01:45,059 --> 01:01:51,720
this idea of moving a plant outdoors to

1715
01:01:48,179 --> 01:01:53,519
sort of revitalize the genetics

1716
01:01:51,719 --> 01:01:54,719
um can you touch on both of those really

1717
01:01:53,519 --> 01:01:58,739
quickly

1718
01:01:54,719 --> 01:02:00,659
sure um okay so the so the first one is

1719
01:01:58,739 --> 01:02:04,078
the name the word the phrase genetic

1720
01:02:00,659 --> 01:02:06,058
drift is is been thrown out a lot and

1721
01:02:04,079 --> 01:02:08,460
it's not in this particular contest is

1722
01:02:06,059 --> 01:02:10,140
not used correctly it's one of those so

1723
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:11,818
sorry so when I was in when I was in

1724
01:02:10,139 --> 01:02:13,440
grad school I was teaching every single

1725
01:02:11,818 --> 01:02:16,440
semester in first year genetics that was

1726
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:18,599
always a tough concept because it sounds

1727
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:19,980
um it sounds like it has a it sort of

1728
01:02:18,599 --> 01:02:21,420
sounds like something like genetic drift

1729
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:23,099
it's drifting away from something um

1730
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:25,920
genetic drift actually refers to Natural

1731
01:02:23,099 --> 01:02:28,559
populations and random mating

1732
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:30,298
um so by random chance you may randomly

1733
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:31,980
drift towards one phenotype just by

1734
01:02:30,298 --> 01:02:35,400
random chance and that's genetic drift

1735
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:37,740
is is sort of uh in in

1736
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:40,260
um natural populations where there's no

1737
01:02:37,739 --> 01:02:41,578
uh there's not is non-random so you've

1738
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:43,319
got random mating and things like that

1739
01:02:41,579 --> 01:02:44,880
like it meets all the criteria of the

1740
01:02:43,318 --> 01:02:47,039
natural population you may get a genetic

1741
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:48,780
drift One Direction so that's not what

1742
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:51,779
we're dealing with

1743
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:53,940
with that clonal stuff did you touch on

1744
01:02:51,780 --> 01:02:55,980
that so like like let's just say let's

1745
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:56,760
let's give an example

1746
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:59,900
um

1747
01:02:56,760 --> 01:03:06,420
so if we had a population of gorillas

1748
01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:08,940
and one gorilla had larger ears they may

1749
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:11,400
that Paul population May drift towards

1750
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:12,539
having larger ears just based on random

1751
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:14,460
mating

1752
01:03:12,539 --> 01:03:17,159
um is that genetic drift then what

1753
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:19,318
you're saying it's it's not necessarily

1754
01:03:17,159 --> 01:03:21,480
um a mutation it's just that one

1755
01:03:19,318 --> 01:03:23,579
particular trait may become more

1756
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:25,920
prevalent over time

1757
01:03:23,579 --> 01:03:28,559
that's right yeah yeah so it's um yeah

1758
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:31,200
so yeah it's it's a very common one

1759
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:33,720
that's um yeah on exams that was always

1760
01:03:31,199 --> 01:03:35,399
a fun one to great so okay I just want

1761
01:03:33,719 --> 01:03:38,639
to make sure I understood it okay

1762
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:39,960
yeah yeah yeah in a nutshell yes yes

1763
01:03:38,639 --> 01:03:42,838
um there's certain assumptions that are

1764
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:44,039
met out in the world that um yeah that's

1765
01:03:42,838 --> 01:03:46,199
where genetic drift is actually

1766
01:03:44,039 --> 01:03:47,818
happening so in these sort of artificial

1767
01:03:46,199 --> 01:03:49,439
scenarios where we're doing artificial

1768
01:03:47,818 --> 01:03:51,239
mating and we're cloning and things like

1769
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:53,099
that it's not applicable here

1770
01:03:51,239 --> 01:03:55,259
um but what we are talking about

1771
01:03:53,099 --> 01:03:57,240
is that a is that you have a genetic you

1772
01:03:55,260 --> 01:03:59,099
have a genotype had a reliable phenotype

1773
01:03:57,239 --> 01:04:00,598
and over time that phenotype is changing

1774
01:03:59,099 --> 01:04:02,760
right so that's sort of what we're

1775
01:04:00,599 --> 01:04:04,559
trying to to discuss um when we talk

1776
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:07,500
when people are talking about that in

1777
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:09,960
this context so that is um

1778
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:11,639
over time you may get mutations that

1779
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:13,318
accumulate within that plant when you

1780
01:04:11,639 --> 01:04:14,879
clone off that plant

1781
01:04:13,318 --> 01:04:16,739
um the Next Generation may have those

1782
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:18,298
slight variations right

1783
01:04:16,739 --> 01:04:19,979
um so because it's because it's clonal

1784
01:04:18,298 --> 01:04:21,659
everything coming off that plant is

1785
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:23,219
going to be a genetically identical and

1786
01:04:21,659 --> 01:04:24,480
then from that you know subsequent

1787
01:04:23,219 --> 01:04:26,039
Generations these things are going to

1788
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:27,619
start to to snowball you're going to get

1789
01:04:26,039 --> 01:04:30,179
more and more of these somatic mutations

1790
01:04:27,619 --> 01:04:31,858
it only affects it if you take a clone

1791
01:04:30,179 --> 01:04:33,480
off of that mutation but if that

1792
01:04:31,858 --> 01:04:35,818
mutation happened early in that next

1793
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:37,079
mom's development but every all those

1794
01:04:35,818 --> 01:04:38,759
cells that grow from it are going to

1795
01:04:37,079 --> 01:04:41,400
have that mutation so

1796
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:43,200
the longer you go the more likely that's

1797
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:45,240
going to happen the longer I live the

1798
01:04:43,199 --> 01:04:46,019
more mutations I'm going to accumulate

1799
01:04:45,239 --> 01:04:48,179
um

1800
01:04:46,019 --> 01:04:50,639
that's just the way it is especially now

1801
01:04:48,179 --> 01:04:53,879
the other this part the next part's the

1802
01:04:50,639 --> 01:04:55,679
stickier part of that is that we our DNA

1803
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:58,680
replication mechanisms get worse over

1804
01:04:55,679 --> 01:05:01,199
time so it introduces more mutations

1805
01:04:58,679 --> 01:05:02,519
um with clonal plants

1806
01:05:01,199 --> 01:05:03,719
I don't have I don't actually know the

1807
01:05:02,519 --> 01:05:05,519
answer is that whether or not those

1808
01:05:03,719 --> 01:05:08,039
replication mechanisms start to get

1809
01:05:05,519 --> 01:05:10,559
worse subsequent Generations or not I

1810
01:05:08,039 --> 01:05:12,119
think that they would

1811
01:05:10,559 --> 01:05:14,280
well I don't actually know the answer

1812
01:05:12,119 --> 01:05:16,700
that so that's one of the issues is that

1813
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:18,540
if you have over time if you have

1814
01:05:16,699 --> 01:05:20,159
mutations that are occurring in the

1815
01:05:18,539 --> 01:05:21,719
replication you know the DNA then you're

1816
01:05:20,159 --> 01:05:23,098
gonna get more and more mutations over

1817
01:05:21,719 --> 01:05:25,199
time it's going to be less able to

1818
01:05:23,099 --> 01:05:26,579
proofread those errors the error rate

1819
01:05:25,199 --> 01:05:28,439
for different organisms you know it's

1820
01:05:26,579 --> 01:05:30,059
like one in a trillion cells or you know

1821
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:31,559
it's it's rare because there's proof

1822
01:05:30,059 --> 01:05:33,660
reading mechanisms in place but it

1823
01:05:31,559 --> 01:05:35,579
happens because we're dividing you know

1824
01:05:33,659 --> 01:05:37,739
trillions of cells to make a plant you

1825
01:05:35,579 --> 01:05:38,460
know lots of cells so it happens

1826
01:05:37,739 --> 01:05:40,379
um

1827
01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:42,358
so that's over time how you're

1828
01:05:40,380 --> 01:05:43,980
accumulating these these changes in

1829
01:05:42,358 --> 01:05:47,098
genotype

1830
01:05:43,980 --> 01:05:49,380
the part about resetting outside

1831
01:05:47,099 --> 01:05:50,818
also I mean I should probably preface it

1832
01:05:49,380 --> 01:05:52,260
this is all speculation on my part

1833
01:05:50,818 --> 01:05:54,000
because I don't have the data to to to

1834
01:05:52,260 --> 01:05:55,440
to go off of

1835
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,659
um

1836
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:59,338
um I've heard of this where you have a

1837
01:05:57,659 --> 01:06:01,139
genetic that's no longer performing the

1838
01:05:59,338 --> 01:06:02,818
way it used to and so people put it

1839
01:06:01,139 --> 01:06:04,618
outside to try and and see if that

1840
01:06:02,818 --> 01:06:06,900
resets some of what you used to love

1841
01:06:04,619 --> 01:06:08,338
about that cultivar or genetic

1842
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:11,280
um

1843
01:06:08,338 --> 01:06:13,078
it's possible that something epigenetic

1844
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:15,359
now these are modifications that are

1845
01:06:13,079 --> 01:06:17,579
triggered by various environmental

1846
01:06:15,358 --> 01:06:18,659
stimuli it's possible that something

1847
01:06:17,579 --> 01:06:19,920
like that

1848
01:06:18,659 --> 01:06:21,899
could

1849
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:23,099
be reintroduced if you put it back

1850
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:24,599
outside

1851
01:06:23,099 --> 01:06:27,059
but I don't have any data to support

1852
01:06:24,599 --> 01:06:28,500
that so those are all anecdotal I've

1853
01:06:27,059 --> 01:06:30,240
heard people who take a plant that's

1854
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:32,338
underperforming grow it outside for a

1855
01:06:30,239 --> 01:06:33,118
generation bring it you know back in or

1856
01:06:32,338 --> 01:06:34,980
whatever

1857
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:36,539
um and it performs better if you were to

1858
01:06:34,980 --> 01:06:37,500
do that I would recommend testing like

1859
01:06:36,539 --> 01:06:38,579
make sure that you're not putting

1860
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:40,559
something outside getting a pathogen

1861
01:06:38,579 --> 01:06:42,240
bringing it back in

1862
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:43,500
um so be careful of that you might want

1863
01:06:42,239 --> 01:06:44,879
to quarantine it when it comes back in

1864
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:46,920
just make sure that there's nothing

1865
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:48,119
pathogenic that you brought back in from

1866
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:50,220
going outside

1867
01:06:48,119 --> 01:06:51,420
um but I wouldn't rule out that being

1868
01:06:50,219 --> 01:06:53,279
away

1869
01:06:51,420 --> 01:06:55,318
I don't yeah I have no reason to suggest

1870
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:56,519
that that wouldn't help you know if

1871
01:06:55,318 --> 01:06:58,199
people say it helps maybe it does I

1872
01:06:56,519 --> 01:06:59,759
don't have any data on that so

1873
01:06:58,199 --> 01:07:02,639
um there are some possible genetic

1874
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:04,859
mechanisms that could potentially be

1875
01:07:02,639 --> 01:07:07,739
involved in something like that so

1876
01:07:04,858 --> 01:07:10,920
um you're saying you're saying

1877
01:07:07,739 --> 01:07:14,279
it is it's possible that by moving a

1878
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:15,838
plant outside maybe exposure to

1879
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:19,280
sunlight so something to do with

1880
01:07:15,838 --> 01:07:21,960
photobiology something to do with the

1881
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:24,599
microbiology interacting with the plant

1882
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:26,338
could potentially unlock something in

1883
01:07:24,599 --> 01:07:31,380
those genetics

1884
01:07:26,338 --> 01:07:33,480
that wasn't being unlocked indoors is

1885
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:36,358
that kind of a dumbing Down way of

1886
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:38,639
saying what you're saying

1887
01:07:36,358 --> 01:07:41,400
yeah I mean it's potentially I mean yeah

1888
01:07:38,639 --> 01:07:43,798
so different you know I mean the light

1889
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:45,480
one I think is interesting because

1890
01:07:43,798 --> 01:07:47,940
full spectrum light

1891
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:50,159
photo period changes those you know

1892
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:52,079
those I mean I know photo period changes

1893
01:07:50,159 --> 01:07:53,000
do involve epigenetic there are some

1894
01:07:52,079 --> 01:07:54,960
some some

1895
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:57,358
non-heritable changes in in gene

1896
01:07:54,960 --> 01:08:00,960
expression that happen uh

1897
01:07:57,358 --> 01:08:04,500
boy is it complicated though so

1898
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:07,019
it's one of those issues that I I just

1899
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:08,400
don't have you know the data it's a

1900
01:08:07,019 --> 01:08:10,798
complicated phenomenon to begin with but

1901
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:12,480
then to try and uh and to try and um

1902
01:08:10,798 --> 01:08:13,619
say that I know one way or the other I

1903
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:16,079
don't

1904
01:08:13,619 --> 01:08:18,060
um so if it works for people it works

1905
01:08:16,079 --> 01:08:18,659
it's sort of where I'm at with it

1906
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:21,839
um

1907
01:08:18,659 --> 01:08:23,698
we do see I will say this uh so we when

1908
01:08:21,838 --> 01:08:26,100
we put a plant through tissue culture

1909
01:08:23,698 --> 01:08:27,358
and it comes back out oftentimes it is a

1910
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:29,640
much healthier version of what that

1911
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:31,319
genetic used to be

1912
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:33,000
um and that could be a variety of

1913
01:08:31,319 --> 01:08:35,539
reasons it could be cleaning up you know

1914
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:38,039
just some un unknown you know some some

1915
01:08:35,539 --> 01:08:39,539
underlying pathogen or calls like that

1916
01:08:38,039 --> 01:08:42,539
it could be putting it into tissue

1917
01:08:39,539 --> 01:08:44,159
culture elicits some sort of epigenetic

1918
01:08:42,539 --> 01:08:45,238
change and it comes back out and it's

1919
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:47,338
healthier

1920
01:08:45,238 --> 01:08:49,738
um so well from my own personal

1921
01:08:47,338 --> 01:08:51,719
experience going through TC does help

1922
01:08:49,738 --> 01:08:53,818
reset that

1923
01:08:51,719 --> 01:08:55,140
um people have said that that going

1924
01:08:53,819 --> 01:08:56,580
Outdoors coming back or it can help

1925
01:08:55,140 --> 01:08:58,380
reset that and I have no reason to say

1926
01:08:56,579 --> 01:08:59,698
that that I have no evidence to say it's

1927
01:08:58,380 --> 01:09:03,659
contrary so

1928
01:08:59,698 --> 01:09:04,738
um the exact mechanisms for why uh I I

1929
01:09:03,659 --> 01:09:06,599
don't know

1930
01:09:04,738 --> 01:09:07,979
um but it could have something to do

1931
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:10,319
with something like a non-heritable

1932
01:09:07,979 --> 01:09:12,718
change like epigenetics which are

1933
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:14,819
chemical modifications of of the genome

1934
01:09:12,719 --> 01:09:17,399
that make certain genes more or less

1935
01:09:14,819 --> 01:09:19,560
likely to be turned on

1936
01:09:17,399 --> 01:09:21,719
um that sort of epigenetics in a

1937
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:24,779
nutshell there are some that are

1938
01:09:21,719 --> 01:09:25,880
heritable but most of them are not

1939
01:09:24,779 --> 01:09:28,859
okay

1940
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:31,699
last question then because I had one

1941
01:09:28,859 --> 01:09:34,560
more are there are there any known

1942
01:09:31,698 --> 01:09:37,439
cultivars or genotypes that are

1943
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:39,060
resistant to hoplate and thyroid at this

1944
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:42,778
time

1945
01:09:39,060 --> 01:09:45,120
at this time I do not have that no

1946
01:09:42,779 --> 01:09:48,900
um there's data to show some level of

1947
01:09:45,119 --> 01:09:51,179
resistance right I mean yeah there's a

1948
01:09:48,899 --> 01:09:54,539
variety yeah

1949
01:09:51,179 --> 01:09:57,600
right and there's there's also uh a

1950
01:09:54,539 --> 01:10:00,000
recent there's a white page by medicinal

1951
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:01,500
genomics uh end of last year where they

1952
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,719
looked at the structure of hot blade and

1953
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:05,939
viroid and I had mentioned earlier that

1954
01:10:03,719 --> 01:10:08,159
the way that it causes symptoms or the

1955
01:10:05,939 --> 01:10:09,779
way that we the the leading hypothesis

1956
01:10:08,159 --> 01:10:13,619
for why it causes symptoms is that part

1957
01:10:09,779 --> 01:10:16,198
of the genome is a match for genes in

1958
01:10:13,619 --> 01:10:17,819
the Cannabis genome and when I say A

1959
01:10:16,198 --> 01:10:21,119
match it's sort of like the yin it's

1960
01:10:17,819 --> 01:10:22,500
it's the the mirror image and when those

1961
01:10:21,119 --> 01:10:24,300
two things come together they form a

1962
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:27,238
double-stranded RNA that can be degraded

1963
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:28,739
so it can basically change gene

1964
01:10:27,238 --> 01:10:30,359
expression

1965
01:10:28,738 --> 01:10:33,059
so what medicinal geometrics then also

1966
01:10:30,359 --> 01:10:34,920
looked for is is cultivars that had a

1967
01:10:33,060 --> 01:10:37,560
slightly different version of that those

1968
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:39,539
genes so that it wasn't such a good

1969
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:41,340
match and so the disease wouldn't

1970
01:10:39,539 --> 01:10:42,899
manifest as much so now it's not

1971
01:10:41,340 --> 01:10:44,579
resistant to infection

1972
01:10:42,899 --> 01:10:47,279
it still would be infected but it would

1973
01:10:44,579 --> 01:10:48,479
be more resistant to the adverse effects

1974
01:10:47,279 --> 01:10:51,119
of infection

1975
01:10:48,479 --> 01:10:53,779
I think that for something like this I

1976
01:10:51,119 --> 01:10:56,819
think that's more likely a path forward

1977
01:10:53,779 --> 01:10:58,319
the problem with viroids is they're so

1978
01:10:56,819 --> 01:11:00,960
darn tiny

1979
01:10:58,319 --> 01:11:03,619
that once they're in the plant and they

1980
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:03,619
start replicating

1981
01:11:04,079 --> 01:11:08,519
there's the challenge is how does the

1982
01:11:06,719 --> 01:11:10,859
plant actually degrade it

1983
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:12,420
um and there are some perhaps genetic

1984
01:11:10,859 --> 01:11:14,939
engineering methods that you could do to

1985
01:11:12,420 --> 01:11:16,560
basically have a plant ready to Target

1986
01:11:14,939 --> 01:11:18,238
that for degradation

1987
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:19,739
but it's it's

1988
01:11:18,238 --> 01:11:21,059
I don't know if we're going to find

1989
01:11:19,738 --> 01:11:22,979
something that's resistant to the

1990
01:11:21,060 --> 01:11:24,420
infection I think what we might find is

1991
01:11:22,979 --> 01:11:26,459
something that's resistant to the

1992
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:28,140
symptoms of the infection I think that's

1993
01:11:26,460 --> 01:11:30,000
probably more likely

1994
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:33,659
what have they done in the Hops

1995
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:35,760
Community to deal with

1996
01:11:33,658 --> 01:11:37,259
hot blade and thyroid

1997
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:38,699
that's a great question

1998
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:40,260
um so up until recently they didn't

1999
01:11:38,698 --> 01:11:41,939
think that hoplite Enviro had caused any

2000
01:11:40,260 --> 01:11:43,500
symptoms I think recent Studies have

2001
01:11:41,939 --> 01:11:45,299
found that it decreases some of the

2002
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:46,920
aromatics some of the you know just like

2003
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:49,320
we're seeing a decrease in in the

2004
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:50,399
cannabinoids THC and things like that I

2005
01:11:49,319 --> 01:11:52,559
think recent Studies have found

2006
01:11:50,399 --> 01:11:56,460
decreases in those those desirable

2007
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:58,080
chemical compounds of hop uh cones

2008
01:11:56,460 --> 01:11:59,100
but previously they hadn't really

2009
01:11:58,079 --> 01:12:00,300
thought it was a big problem so they

2010
01:11:59,100 --> 01:12:03,179
weren't really doing a whole heck of a

2011
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:06,719
lot some of the things they do

2012
01:12:03,179 --> 01:12:08,340
um to prevent uh having so when you have

2013
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:10,319
the material lying around you know the

2014
01:12:08,340 --> 01:12:11,880
facilities full of hop cones and things

2015
01:12:10,319 --> 01:12:13,500
like that and Vines and when you destroy

2016
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:15,480
the binds some of the things they're

2017
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:16,859
doing is uh anaerobic digestion at high

2018
01:12:15,479 --> 01:12:19,259
heat

2019
01:12:16,859 --> 01:12:20,939
um so this goes back to that how hot do

2020
01:12:19,260 --> 01:12:23,039
you need to go to get thyroid to get

2021
01:12:20,939 --> 01:12:25,259
degradation they did show degradation of

2022
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:27,960
hop Lane viroid at 70 Celsius but it

2023
01:12:25,260 --> 01:12:30,480
took like days uh

2024
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:33,000
and that's also an anaerobic

2025
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:34,799
um digestion so they have enzymes in

2026
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:36,179
there that are helping degrade some of

2027
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:37,560
that stuff so

2028
01:12:36,179 --> 01:12:39,239
um

2029
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:40,440
what are they doing same things we're

2030
01:12:39,238 --> 01:12:41,639
doing it's more preventative than

2031
01:12:40,439 --> 01:12:42,419
anything

2032
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:45,179
um

2033
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:47,819
and getting rid of stocks that have

2034
01:12:45,179 --> 01:12:48,600
thyroid so they have a different viroid

2035
01:12:47,819 --> 01:12:50,819
I think they're more concerned about

2036
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:52,800
hops stunt thyroid

2037
01:12:50,819 --> 01:12:57,899
um and so that one has been shown to be

2038
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:59,940
transmitted by aphids uh goats uh a few

2039
01:12:57,899 --> 01:13:02,039
other things so so the Hop stunt viroid

2040
01:12:59,939 --> 01:13:04,139
is probably their major concern I think

2041
01:13:02,039 --> 01:13:05,939
more now that they've learned more about

2042
01:13:04,140 --> 01:13:08,760
the cone thing that maybe hop Lane be

2043
01:13:05,939 --> 01:13:10,979
more uh more prevalent but yeah testing

2044
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:12,719
clean stocks

2045
01:13:10,979 --> 01:13:14,579
um and I guess replacing whenever they

2046
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:16,739
have to because those grow from rhizomes

2047
01:13:14,579 --> 01:13:18,600
right so it's you're kind of

2048
01:13:16,738 --> 01:13:20,639
having to dig those up and replace them

2049
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:22,560
whenever you have to but

2050
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:25,380
um yeah it's I mean it's really the same

2051
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:27,000
issues I mean viroids cannot be there's

2052
01:13:25,380 --> 01:13:29,400
nothing you can do there's no there's no

2053
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:31,859
there's no pesticide or or spray you can

2054
01:13:29,399 --> 01:13:34,439
use to get rid of a viroid um as it

2055
01:13:31,859 --> 01:13:35,880
stands now and I don't expect there to

2056
01:13:34,439 --> 01:13:38,279
be one just because of how these things

2057
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:40,199
operate what they actually are

2058
01:13:38,279 --> 01:13:41,819
um unfortunately the reality is clean

2059
01:13:40,198 --> 01:13:45,719
stocks and preventative measures are

2060
01:13:41,819 --> 01:13:47,460
your best tool against them

2061
01:13:45,719 --> 01:13:49,198
great well on that note I really

2062
01:13:47,460 --> 01:13:50,640
appreciate your time today I learned a

2063
01:13:49,198 --> 01:13:52,559
lot and I think that was really helpful

2064
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:55,440
to get that information out to Growers

2065
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:58,320
so thank you so much and uh thank you

2066
01:13:55,439 --> 01:14:00,779
yeah have a wonderful rest of your day

2067
01:13:58,319 --> 01:14:03,238
yep and if anybody's interested in virus

2068
01:14:00,779 --> 01:14:05,219
testing my email is jack.muns at Three

2069
01:14:03,238 --> 01:14:07,198
Rivers biotechs that's three is in the

2070
01:14:05,219 --> 01:14:09,658
number three rivers biotech

2071
01:14:07,198 --> 01:14:11,759
um and then we also do tissue culture uh

2072
01:14:09,658 --> 01:14:13,799
in in various States and also in Canada

2073
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:16,739
so if you're interested in cleaning up

2074
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:18,179
stocks that's one way or storage so yeah

2075
01:14:16,738 --> 01:14:19,738
if you have any questions reach out and

2076
01:14:18,179 --> 01:14:20,940
I will answer as best I can thank you

2077
01:14:19,738 --> 01:14:23,359
