podcast where we discuss the cutting

7
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:28,399
edge of growing from a science-based

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,920
perspective and drawn top

9
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:31,598
experts from around the industry to

00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,520
the market and new stuff popping up

13
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,920
every day

14
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,359
on my social media feeds i see ads for

15
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,960
gardening products all the time that

16
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:42,878
claim to be the best or something i

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,079
absolutely need for my garden

18
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:45,599
so how do you sort through all the

19
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,840
marketing hype and get to the bottom of

20
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,840
what's really worth your time and money

21
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,440
i brought suzanne wayne wright evans

22
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,800
back to help me with this podcast

23
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:54,399
because she has a long background in

24
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:55,679
both the cannabis industry and the

25
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,359
horticulture industry

26
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:58,878
so she has really seen both sides and

27
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:00,159
how different marketing is between the

28
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:01,839
two industries

29
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:03,599
this podcast is really a discussion on

30
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,159
how to evaluate products and what

31
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,000
questions

32
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,240
i think you should be asking as a grower

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,200
when evaluating a product or inputs into

34
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:11,519
your garden

35
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,520

well you know you and i have talked a

00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:09,199
lot off the air

65
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:11,759
about a variety of uh products and how

66
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:14,399
to evaluate products and how to look at

67
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:15,919
biocontrols and pesticides and uh you

68
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,280
actually had me come down

69
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:21,679
to the biocontrols conference to

70
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,919
give a talk on exactly the subject and i

71
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,480
just thought it was so important that we

72
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:27,919
might want to cover it on the podcast so

73
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:30,238
uh thank you for doing this

74
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:31,598
well and let me let me cut in because i

75
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,840
i'm going to say it again

76
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:35,518
that was a phenomenal presentation you

77
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,560
did and anybody that missed it really

78
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,519
missed out

79
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,280
and i'm really once everybody gets to go

80
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,560
back to meetings and conferences don't

81
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,000
think i'm not going to be pushing for

82
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,560
you to do that same talk

83
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,280
at other events because i think you had

84
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,920
a really

85
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,598
really good message and it was great

86
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:53,119

00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:55,439
things about it so thank you for coming

88
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,158
and doing that

89
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:59,519
wow well thank you i was super nervous

90
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:02,079
so i'm glad that it went

91
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,439
it went pretty well um yeah public

92
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,120
speaking is tough for me

93
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:07,199
but i'm glad i got to do it it was a

94
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,800
wonderful opportunity right before

95
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:12,318
this whole pandemic hit um but to really

96
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,239
dive in on this topic just to

97
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:15,919
keep things moving i kind of want to

98
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,158
talk about a general overview

99
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:20,079
of how we evaluate a product and then i

100
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:23,280
want to talk more specifically with you

101
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,879
about how do we evaluate you know

102
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,400
media soil and compost how do we

103
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:27,759
evaluate nutrients

104
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,680
and then really your wheelhouse how do

105
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:32,878
we evaluate pesticides and

106
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:35,519
bio controls in general so and microbial

107
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:37,280
inputs things like that so

108
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,200
talking from a general overview i want

109
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,039
to just highlight a few points and then

110
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:42,399
if you want to just jump in with any

111
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:45,199
suggestions thoughts

112
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,080
as we go along that would be great so if

113
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:48,158
we're talking about

114
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,680
a product in general the first thing i

115
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:51,519
want to say is that there's no such

116
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,519
thing as a good product

117
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,959
uh there is such thing as a bad product

118
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,239
for your garden uh there's a lot of

119
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,120
snake oil products out there and that's

120
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,239
one of the reasons we're doing this

121
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,319
podcast

122
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,239
in particular but in terms of a good

123
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:04,719
product i hear people all the time like

124
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,519
hey you know my buddy's using product x

125
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:08,000
in their garden

126
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,959
i need to get products x in my garden or

127
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,400
what do you think about

128
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,799
i get question emails like hey should i

129
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,360
add product x into my into my regimen

130
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,280
and

131
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,199
my question or my response to them is

132
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,720
really like well

133
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,959
what's in the product and what what does

134
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,880
your garden actually need because

135
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,079
i think this is an important thing to to

136
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:27,040
really highlight at the beginning is

137
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:29,918
like for example if we're talking about

138
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,199
nutrients if your plant is if or your

139
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:33,680
soil is lacking

140
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,879
nitrogen and you add a product that has

141
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,759
nitrogen in it

142
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:37,680
you're going to get a good plant

143
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,800
response it was a good product to apply

144
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,840
and you're going to have

145
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,439
a healthier plant however if your soil

146
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:44,319
already has sufficient levels of

147
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:46,478
nutrients

148
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:47,759
or nitrogen in this case by adding more

149
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:49,519
nitrogen you're not actually

150
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,199
going to be improving the quality of

151
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:52,399
your soil the health of your

152
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,400
plant and you could actually cause

153
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:55,679
toxicities and other problems so

154
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:57,039
that's i guess what i want to get out

155
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,800
when i say there's no such thing as a

156
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,479
good product

157
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,919
we really have to look at our garden

158
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:05,038
holistically

159
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:07,599
and make a determination based on what

160
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:10,719
the limiting factors of growth are

161
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,520
for our plant do you want to comment on

162
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,039
that at all

163
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:15,599
yeah no i agree because i mean you can

164
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:17,360
have

165
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,120
you know the best products in a way in

166
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,919
the world but if your plants don't need

167
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,720
them

168
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:24,319
there's you know no point in using them

169
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,160
because i get that too

170
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:28,079
people ask all the time you know product

171
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,000
x you know should i be spraying this and

172
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:33,120
my question is do you need it

173
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,800
um and just because you know that a

174
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,918
product may work well in a particular

175
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,840
pest or resolve

176
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:39,839
a particular nutritional issue only if

177
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:43,119
your crop needs it is it

178
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:44,879
necessary um so i i think

179
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,160
you're dead on there and it's important

180
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:49,759
to evaluate

181
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,439
um if if those products actually do what

182
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,240
they claim because

183
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:54,959
i see a lot of claims on a lot of

184
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,759
products

185
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:58,318
um thus you know part of the the tinfoil

186
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:02,160
hat

187
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:05,360
issue and without

188
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:08,319
any science to back them up which

189
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,840
you know is is a very important part of

190
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,280
trying to decide if you need a product

191
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:13,038
or not

192
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:14,559
yes i completely agree with that that

193
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:17,279
actually brings up my next

194
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,560
sort of thing i put together a list of

195
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:19,918
just kind of like

196
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,759
a few different things that i want to

197
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:23,120
highlight that i kind of keep in my head

198
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,080
whenever i'm thinking about

199
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,439
any product uh and potentially adding it

200
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:29,359
to my garden

201
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:30,719
and some of these questions are are sort

202
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,479
of the following here like one

203
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,400
what are the ingredients you know are

204
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:36,719
they using high quality inputs

205
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:37,439
uh what's the manufacturing or processes

206
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,960
involved

207
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:41,038
and if they tell me it's proprietary

208
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:42,879
that's my first red flag

209
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:44,159
most people are willing to share if

210
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:46,879
they're legitimate

211
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,319
at least some of what's going on uh with

212
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:50,399
the product that they're making

213
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,080
um if and if they don't understand the

214
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:55,279
mechanism of action

215
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:55,839
like uh i've had some people regarding

216
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:58,079
uh

217
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:59,359
you know adding sea salt you know some

218
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:01,680
of these uh

219
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,360
salt-based sodium products that where

220
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,800
they're harvesting you know salt out of

221
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,280
the middle of the ocean or sea water out

222
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,520
of the middle

223
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:08,879
of the mill the ocean i say why why do i

224
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:11,038
want to be adding this to my garden

225
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:11,918
and they're not able to give me you know

226
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:14,000
a really

227
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:15,038
solid answer uh that's something i

228
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,560
really struggle with or they're not

229
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:18,079
willing to tell me you know exactly how

230
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,839
they're manufacturing it's a special

231
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:21,279
process that they can't share because it

232
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:23,679
would give everything away

233
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:25,038
uh those are that's just a big red flag

234
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,400
for me right you want to touch on that

235
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:28,719
on before i mention the next one

236
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:29,758
yeah and you know from a pest management

237
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,880
standpoint

238
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:36,319
from pesticides and

239
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:38,399
if it kills a pest it is a pesticide

240
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,479
soaps and oils and all that are

241
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:41,758
pesticides pesticides is not necessarily

242
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:45,680
a bad word

243
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:48,160
but if the products are epa registered

244
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,079
for their active ingredient in the

245
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,199
product the active means that's that's

246
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:53,199
the part of the product

247
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,478
that gets the work done they have to

248
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,400
list what it is

249
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:58,478
because that way you know exactly what

250
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:00,878
you're applying to the plant

251
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:02,719
now there are inerts in there and those

252
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,879
often are the carriers

253
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,639
which could be you know different

254
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,840
powders talcs

255
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:11,680
clay oils and things like that

256
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:13,519
they don't necessarily have to give you

257
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,598
all the inner information but you can

258
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:18,159
find a lot of the information like on

259
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:21,360
msds sheets and things like that

260
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:23,759
but that's one of the reasons why

261
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,240
i'm a little lean more towards some of

262
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,680
the epa richard products is because

263
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,000
they they have to be a bit more

264
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:33,440
forthcoming with you about what's

265
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,958
what's in the product sometimes you're

266
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,880
not necessarily going to be able to find

267
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:40,239
out all the manufacturing

268
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:42,240
um of methods

269
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,278
um and you know i was talking to a

270
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,759
friend of mine who

271
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:47,200
um she works at a fertilizer

272
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:50,159
manufacturing company

273
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,879
and she said that for their fertilizer

274
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:54,480
inputs

275
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:56,399
before they'll even offload the innards

276
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,600
to the factory or the input products

277
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,159
they're having metal testing the

278
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,360
products

279
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:03,120
right on the truck to make sure that

280
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,159
even before they unload there's no heavy

281
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,799
metals in it

282
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:08,480
to make sure purity of the product and

283
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:10,799
you know companies telling you

284
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,680
they're doing things like that really

285
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:13,359
make you feel

286
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:16,159
better about using those products and

287
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,839
they do have set standards

288
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:20,159
totally that uh i think that is

289
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,519
important and just to get to give an

290
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:22,079
example of what you mentioned like for

291
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,759
example

292
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,200
uh the first thing i thought of and i

293
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:26,080
know you're not a huge fan of it but is

294
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,600
neem oil

295
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,200
uh there we're talking about an active

296
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,639
ingredient of acidoractin

297
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,399
it's also you know no there's

298
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:34,958
derivatives like azimax right

299
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,000
no isn't that no and neem oil the active

300
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:39,679
ingredient is neem

301
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,320
oil in um the acid aractin

302
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:43,519
is a derivative that comes from the neem

303
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,600
plant also that's

304
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,679
not really an oil that's an insect

305
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,519
growth regulator

306
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:51,519
so there's actually two products that

307
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,720
come out of the neem well there's lots

308
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,600
of products come out the neem tree but

309
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,000
as far as

310
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,920
you know plants are concerned you know

311
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,879
you basically have neem oil which is a

312
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:00,639
suffocant

313
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:02,720
and also has a repelling quality and

314
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:05,838
then you have acid aractin which is

315
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,440
the active in you know there's

316
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,200
i don't know like 10 15 different

317
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,839
products on the market now

318
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,320
they they have as a max as a troll yeah

319
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,839
now

320
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,839
when you say that so does so that would

321
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,800
neem oil have to without getting off on

322
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,720
a tangent would nemo

323
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:20,559
have to list azidar actin as an active

324
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,680
ingredient if it's epa certified

325
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:25,359
no because our register the acid aractin

326
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:27,039
to my understanding has been removed out

327
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,519
of it because again it's an

328
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:31,120
oil you're spraying not an insect's

329
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,240
earth regulator with the neem product it

330
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,839
is a suffocant

331
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,680
they're two different things they're

332
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:38,399
splitting what they're getting out of

333
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:41,439
the plant apart

334
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:43,039
because i've seen azidoractin levels on

335
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,200
tests of

336
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:46,319
neem based products it could be that

337
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,759
that's part of the testing

338
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,640
it could that could happen and this is

339
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:53,360
the meme's been very inconsistent

340
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:55,039
um there's been you know ish i don't

341
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,360
want to say issues makes it sound bad

342
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:57,278
but

343
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,959
you know the it's i would say it's a

344
00:10:57,278 --> 00:11:02,000
pretty inconsistent product

345
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:03,599
because it is it's a botanical

346
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,039
because it's coming from a plant in the

347
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,240
harvesting methods and the plants

348
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,559
themselves can be

349
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,759
different you know what where they're

350
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:12,399
grown how they're

351
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:13,600
you know raised just like how cannabis

352
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,159
is a perfect example

353
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,120
you know you extract from cannabis and

354
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:20,240
how it's grown

355
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,919
you get different compounds out of it so

356
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,320
it's possible there's traces of it in

357
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:25,120
there

358
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,040
but it's not sold as an acidoractan

359
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,078
product that's a separate product in

360
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:30,078
itself

361
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:31,679
also you know there could be because

362
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:33,599
there has been these contamination

363
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:35,679
issues with the neem oils with the other

364
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,480
synthetic pesticides it's possible there

365
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:39,199
could be some

366
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,000
isotoractin uh contamination potentially

367
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,200
happening too

368
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,559
at the processing facility that's

369
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,839
interesting i wasn't uh

370
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:47,439
i wasn't aware of that distinction

371
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,720
between the two so that's yeah that's

372
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,240
good

373
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,079
because you look at the label and you

374
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,759
look at what the active is and either

375
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:54,879
it'll say neem oil or it will say

376
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:56,879
azidoractin

377
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:59,039
and so like acid reaction being an

378
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:01,600
insect growth regulator what that does

379
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:02,240
is that it regulates the growth of

380
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,560
insects

381
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,680
so it prevents them from being able to

382
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:08,879
basically molt

383
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:10,159
into their next life stage and so it

384
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:13,120
works very well on

385
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:14,559
immature insects where if you've got a

386
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,240
whole bunch of adult insect

387
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:18,000
acid reaction really isn't necessarily

388
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:21,919
great for that where neem oil

389
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:25,039
working as a suffocant would be

390
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:25,679
got it thank you for clarifying that

391
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:29,120
you're welcome

392
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:30,638
and uh moving on to my second

393
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,639
point here is one you kind of already

394
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:35,600
mentioned uh is the product

395
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:37,919
certified so is it registered is organic

396
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,519
epa certified is it registered as a

397
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:41,599
fertilizer

398
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,679
you know with living soils we don't have

399
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,278
that requirement however i know my

400
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:46,559
company we chose to to do that

401
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:47,679
registration because of the amount of

402
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:51,199
nutrients that we're putting

403
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:53,838
into our soil and that that registration

404
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,720
or level of certification requires a lot

405
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,880
more reporting

406
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,040
it requires heavy metal testing it

407
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:02,480
requires me to put an mpk level

408
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:04,078
on my bag and by taking it a step

409
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,839
further and getting certified certified

410
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:07,759
organic

411
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,519
you know they're tracing everything all

412
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:11,360
of my inputs all the way back so there's

413
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,200
someone out there that knows my recipe

414
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,200
with the you know organic certification

415
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,600
and is verifying that the inputs are

416
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:20,000
organic that they're all registered

417
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,360
that they're allowed for use in organic

418
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,919
production

419
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,959
so while it's not a perfect system

420
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:26,319
because someone could

421
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:27,759
you know go through all of this and then

422
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,079
still throw in an ingredient that you're

423
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:31,360
not allowed to use

424
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:33,359
guardian might spray would be a great

425
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,600
example of that on the pesticide side

426
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,560
there is at least some level of

427
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,360
oversight

428
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:40,239
and regulation around the product uh and

429
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,600
testing so

430
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,919
you know the oregon department of

431
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,040
agriculture wsda here in washington will

432
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:47,278
go out

433
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:48,719
off of a shelf and pull a product and

434
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:50,078
you know check the weight on it

435
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,639
check the label make sure everything's

436
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:54,479
correct uh do a nutrient analysis

437
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,480
and make sure that what is being claimed

438
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,440
on the label matches up with what you're

439
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,120
actually receiving

440
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,800
in the bottle or in the box or in the

441
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,480
soil so

442
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:03,919
having a product certified is just one

443
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,320
more level of protection it's not

444
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:07,599
the end-all be-all um as i mentioned but

445
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,600
it is something to consider

446
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,440
and uh do you want to touch a little bit

447
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,079
about what that epa registration is

448
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,680
because i think

449
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:15,278
this is one of the really important

450
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:18,159
points around

451
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:20,078
pesticides with sort of what type of

452
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:21,838
registration that they're able to get or

453
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:25,198
what they have around a product

454
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:28,880
well it used to be that if you

455
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:31,039
claimed any pesticide

456
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:33,439
activity like if you said my product

457
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:36,240
kills aphid my product kills mites

458
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,480
my product kills rats even rodentia

459
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,198
sides fall under pesticides

460
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:43,199
by law you had to have it registered

461
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:45,359
with the epa

462
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:46,399
and you know each state then reviews

463
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,320
labels and because

464
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,078
you'll see with pesticides like the

465
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,360
label in california can be different

466
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:52,879
than new york or

467
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,959
you can have products we can use in

468
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:55,838
florida but then we can't use them in

469
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:58,319
new york so

470
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,760
then on top of it each state you know

471
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,680
kind of looks at the product and makes

472
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:03,439
decisions on it too

473
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:06,239
but about i'm trying to remember the

474
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,680
exact year maybe about 10 years ago

475
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,399
and i should know this off the top of my

476
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:11,120
head um uh the federal government said

477
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,720
listen

478
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,959
you know there's certain products out

479
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,160
there you know rosemary oil is a really

480
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:19,759
good example

481
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:22,000
we know it has pesticidal properties

482
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:22,958
but we also know it's pretty safe for

483
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,879
humans

484
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:26,159
because it's in a lot of cosmetics it's

485
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:29,439
in food it's

486
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:31,439
in a bunch of different stuff so if

487
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,959
people are using it and we know it's

488
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,600
safe you know

489
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:36,319
then we're not going to require you to

490
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,480
register

491
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,680
a product if that's the active

492
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,360
ingredient in it

493
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:46,399
and there's a list from

494
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:49,278
the epa if you go the 25 25b

495
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:51,519
list is one of the names they call it um

496
00:15:49,278 --> 00:15:55,198
but it's basically you have these exempt

497
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:56,720
inputs and

498
00:15:55,198 --> 00:15:58,240
the thing is again all that means is

499
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,600
those products are

500
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:04,079
safe for humans it doesn't mean

501
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,360
that they're good miticides or

502
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:07,439
insecticides or

503
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,879
are safer plants by any stretch the

504
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,279
imagination

505
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:13,278
but with the cannabis industry really

506
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:14,480
kicking up over the last few years and

507
00:16:13,278 --> 00:16:16,958
people looking for

508
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,879
products there has been this flood to

509
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:22,319
the market of of these products

510
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:24,480
that are not epa registered and

511
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,360
it's been a very much buyer beware

512
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,519
situation

513
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,278
because we don't always know what's in

514
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,480
them there's really not a lot of

515
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:33,519
oversight

516
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:36,079
federally on them

517
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,799
and when you contact these companies and

518
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:39,198
say okay

519
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:41,439
do you have any trial data do you have

520
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:42,559
any and it's really hard to get specific

521
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,720
information

522
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:45,679
where when you have something epa

523
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,560
registered

524
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:50,000
um there you can definitely get a lot

525
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:51,758
more information on the product because

526
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,600
there's such higher requirements through

527
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:55,039
the epa to get a product registered and

528
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,360
it takes years and years

529
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:58,480
there's lots of testing and now you know

530
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,039
they have to do all this b

531
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,720
testing now uh to make sure your product

532
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:06,240
is going to be safe for bees but

533
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:08,160
those exempt products um don't have to

534
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,279
go through any of that rigorous testing

535
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,038
and so

536
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:12,959
that's where you can really see the the

537
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:15,119
differences out there

538
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,318
but the cannabis industry has really

539
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:19,678
exploded with these

540
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:21,119
exempt products that is the perfect lead

541
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,000
into the next question that i keep in my

542
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:24,719
head

543
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,400
which is is the product found outside of

544
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,679
the cannabis industry

545
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,440
do you want to explain why that might be

546
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:31,038
an important uh

547
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,558
variable to consider when you're looking

548
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:36,000
at a product yeah

549
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:39,200
so um i say this all the time too

550
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,679
in my presentations that when you look

551
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:45,279
at let's say poinsettia growers

552
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:47,280
their profit margins are so low

553
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:48,879
on poinsettias sometimes just a few

554
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:51,759
pennies a pot

555
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,400
that they can't afford to use products

556
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:55,599
um

557
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,440
that don't work and so i always say to

558
00:17:55,599 --> 00:18:00,480
my cannabis guys you know these

559
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:03,038
all these wonderful cannabis products

560
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,759
why aren't other industries really using

561
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:07,038
them

562
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:08,400
and you know from what i my experience

563
00:18:07,038 --> 00:18:10,400
has been and what we've tested because a

564
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:14,480
lot of times they don't work that well

565
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:16,240
um and also the the

566
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,480
the ability to get information on a

567
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,919
product that is epa registered as a

568
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,519
company i mean there's just so much more

569
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,280
information available for these epa

570
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:26,960
registered products

571
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:29,918
i i don't see my

572
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,759
non-cannabis growers using many of these

573
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:33,280
non-epa registered products because

574
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:34,960
again they can't get information they

575
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:36,399
can't get trial information and again

576
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,279
sometimes it's a mystery to what's

577
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,600
really in there

578
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:40,399
and also a lot of them are botanical

579
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:44,079
oils

580
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:47,519
which can be highly phytotoxic

581
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:49,119
and that's another big concern yes with

582
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:51,200
epa registered products of course you

583
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:54,479
can have phytotoxicity

584
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:56,480
but because of liability reasons

585
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,400
the companies do a lot of thorough

586
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,558
testing and generally the labels will

587
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,880
tell you exactly what you can and cannot

588
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:04,160
use

589
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,840
products on to prevent lawsuits because

590
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,160
i have seen

591
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:09,119
lawsuits where people have sprayed a

592
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,120
product it's

593
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:12,959
killed the crop and then they've sued

594
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:14,479
the manufacturer of the product and i

595
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,759
have a feeling

596
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,240
one of these days this is going to

597
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:19,839
happen in the cannabis industry

598
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,679
right now i haven't heard of any things

599
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:22,639
like that happening but i've absolutely

600
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:26,240
seen it happen

601
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,240
in the ornamental market

602
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:31,038
so i i guess that brings up some

603
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:33,678
questions for me around uh

604
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:35,359
phytotoxicity have you seen a lot of you

605
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,840
mentioned botanical air uh

606
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:39,439
oils when you talk about phytotoxicity

607
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:41,519
is there anything you can

608
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,600
share around that that might be a

609
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:45,519
warning to listeners

610
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,959
in terms of potential active ingredients

611
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:49,359
that might be more

612
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,640
likely to cause phytotoxicity well but

613
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:53,279
it's hard to know

614
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,559
because sometimes they don't break down

615
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:57,678
the concentrations

616
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:59,359
of what's in the product um i think

617
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:02,080
sometimes they do that

618
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:03,519
because if you really knew that you know

619
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:05,038
this particular bottle of product you

620
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:07,519
just paid a hundred dollars for

621
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:09,519
has you know one percent rosemary and

622
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:13,038
you know half a percent thyme

623
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:14,960
and you know one percent garlic extract

624
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:16,960
so really there's about three three

625
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,519
dollars maybe of active ingredient in

626
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,360
there you

627
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:20,798
they can you can understand what the

628
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:24,319
markup on these products

629
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:25,440
are um so and also i understand

630
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:26,879
that people are trying to make a

631
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,480
competitive product and you don't want

632
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:32,240
to hand your formula

633
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:35,759
to somebody else um so

634
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:38,640
you know even with any epa registered

635
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:39,200
product when a new product comes to

636
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,080
market

637
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,120
with my ornamental growers we always do

638
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:45,759
trials first

639
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:47,359
first is it safe for the plant do we see

640
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:51,519
any phytoplexity and second

641
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:53,678
does it actually do what it says it does

642
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:55,679
we do have the advantage that you know a

643
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,600
lot of the universities

644
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,360
do trial these epa registered products

645
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:01,038
for ornamentals and vegetables so we

646
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:03,759
have that as a resource i'm hoping

647
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:05,440
down the road because a lot of the

648
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:06,480
land-grant universities are now working

649
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,600
on hemp

650
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:14,000
we can get more trial work

651
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:17,119
you know through that avenue um

652
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,480
but you know it it's it's tough for the

653
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:20,798
growers and it's tough

654
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:23,120
for the growers to know if the claims

655
00:21:20,798 --> 00:21:25,119
are really true or not

656
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:26,798
um you know one of the biggest things

657
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:27,439
that makes me just want to bang my head

658
00:21:26,798 --> 00:21:28,798
on the wall

659
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,279
is when i see people all the time

660
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:34,400
promoting you know their

661
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:34,960
amazing unicorn tear pesticide only

662
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,798
kills

663
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,159
pests like hemp fluorescent might but

664
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:39,519
it's absolutely safe for your

665
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:42,720
beneficials

666
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:44,720
it just doesn't work that way

667
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,640
now some of the synthetic chemistries

668
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,440
which can't be used in cannabis and hip

669
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,919
at this time

670
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,120
we actually do have some very very

671
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:54,000
targeted

672
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:56,959
pesticides that work on very particular

673
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,720
very specific metabolic pathways

674
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,400
there's a one miticide that's made by

675
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,960
basf that

676
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,480
that's pretty safe with most beneficials

677
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,759
and we can actually spray it over top of

678
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,480
predatory mites

679
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:09,599
but it absolutely smokes two spot spider

680
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,640
mites immatures

681
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:14,719
adults and eggs so in the synthetic

682
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,720
world we do have some pretty good

683
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,038
products like that but when it comes to

684
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,759
the

685
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:21,200
non-epa registered stuff which almost

686
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:24,240
all are killing

687
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:26,000
more as a suffocant or a desiccant it's

688
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,079
their broad spectrum products and so

689
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,798
they're going to be non-selective

690
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:34,000
and again with with soaps and oils you

691
00:22:30,798 --> 00:22:37,519
have to be very careful of particle size

692
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,798
um because again a phyto toxicity and

693
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:40,400
actually

694
00:22:38,798 --> 00:22:42,079
will they kill and it's kind of

695
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,480
interesting to look to

696
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:46,399
um at the differences between the oils

697
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,720
because rosemary oil

698
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,840
um which has been abused a bit more and

699
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,519
there's some products that have been

700
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:54,079
trying to go mainstream

701
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:56,079
um the limitation there is cost because

702
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:58,879
rosemary oil is very expensive and

703
00:22:56,079 --> 00:23:00,158
it can be a good alternative because

704
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,400
there's no

705
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,840
rei or re-entry interval with it so you

706
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,559
can spray it and your workers can go

707
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:06,558
back to work

708
00:23:04,558 --> 00:23:08,000
but what's interesting is rosemary oil

709
00:23:06,558 --> 00:23:11,599
does not work well on

710
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:14,720
like spider mite eggs where the

711
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:17,678
petroleum oils the parafanatic oils they

712
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,679
smoke spider mite eggs so not all oils

713
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,400
are the same and they all do not perform

714
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,840
the same

715
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:26,880
out in the field

716
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:28,798
well that i kind of touched on the next

717
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,400
point that i had here which was what

718
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:32,240
testing and research do you have to

719
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,720
support the claims

720
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,519
that they're making around the product

721
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,279
and

722
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:39,599
what of that research are they willing

723
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:41,839
to share with you um

724
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:43,038
i think that's really important that we

725
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:47,278
ask those questions

726
00:23:43,038 --> 00:23:50,319
and then be very very uh

727
00:23:47,278 --> 00:23:53,038
critical of what responses we get back

728
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:53,759
um critical in the sense of that we're

729
00:23:53,038 --> 00:23:55,839
we're really

730
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:57,038
evaluating what they're saying and not

731
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:59,759
getting overwhelmed

732
00:23:57,038 --> 00:24:00,319
by you know quote unquote science so i

733
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:03,200
had

734
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:04,399
i had a guy recently that was making a

735
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,519
claim about how their

736
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,320
their microbial product uh create made

737
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:10,400
up for

738
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:11,678
low light conditions and so i reached

739
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,640
out to him i said you have research on

740
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,519
this and he sent me

741
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:17,278
an encyclopedia on quantum physics and

742
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:18,720
said that this answered it and i that's

743
00:24:17,278 --> 00:24:19,919
like this this has nothing to do with

744
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,480
what you're claiming

745
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,120
and it was very scientific looking but

746
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,720
uh

747
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:26,798
again had nothing to do with actually

748
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,000
answering or supporting the claim that

749
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:30,720
they were making

750
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,519
and uh this is a really time consuming

751
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,798
part of it but

752
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:35,119
if we're talking about adding something

753
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:36,798
into our garden i think it's critical

754
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:38,639
that we spend the time to really

755
00:24:36,798 --> 00:24:40,480
research what we're doing and

756
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,240
you know obviously having peer review

757
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,679
research is really nice but that's

758
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,440
difficult when we start talking about

759
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,960
the cannabis industry we don't have that

760
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:50,400
you know a lot of it is

761
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:53,120
anecdotal you know experiential

762
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,640
word of mouth there is some research

763
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:56,798
more and more coming out daily

764
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,880
and like you mentioned there's research

765
00:24:56,798 --> 00:25:00,158
on other crops that doesn't necessarily

766
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,600
cross over perfectly but

767
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:03,440
at least give us a trend or an

768
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:04,240
indication as to the quality of our

769
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,519
product

770
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:09,038
but um how do you evaluate uh

771
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:10,798
you know research yourself if you want

772
00:25:09,038 --> 00:25:12,079
to look at not so much if you want to

773
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:13,519
test it out yourself because i want to

774
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:14,960
that's my next one i want to talk about

775
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:16,558
but if you wanted to look at what body

776
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,600
of research existed about a product

777
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:20,879
let's take

778
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:21,439
you know pesticide x where would you

779
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,880
start

780
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:28,000
in that sort of like testing research

781
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:30,799
supporting the claims world online

782
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,278
or through your contacts well i mean i

783
00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:32,879
always

784
00:25:31,278 --> 00:25:34,960
you know when it dissects the product

785
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,799
and know again with the actives in it

786
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,880
what you know what's in the product

787
00:25:36,798 --> 00:25:40,400
because you know if you look at a

788
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,320
product and let's just say

789
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,440
product x is well just since we've been

790
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:45,119
talking about rosemary and i'm not

791
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,480
picking on rosemary oil because it can

792
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:47,439
be a very good product and the right

793
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,360
application

794
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,840
but you know okay we now we know it

795
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:53,839
contains rosemary oil

796
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:55,119
well then i want to go look and see what

797
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:57,918
research has been done

798
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:59,439
on rosemary because you know you

799
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:00,159
mentioned how there's not a lot of

800
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,679
research

801
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:04,640
done on uh you know cannabis crops

802
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:06,480
believe it or not

803
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,880
on some of the ornamental crops there's

804
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:12,000
not a lot of research either

805
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:15,520
and where a lot of research is done

806
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:18,640
is on food crops and so i kind of

807
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:20,639
have to go to food crop research and see

808
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,960
what i can extract out of that to see

809
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,080
how it applies to what i'm actually

810
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,600
working on

811
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:28,158
and so i do what's called you know a

812
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:30,798
literature search where you

813
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:32,400
do a search for research papers that

814
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:34,319
have been published and i tend to look

815
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,000
at like active ingredients

816
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:37,519
um of you know what's the active in

817
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
there so i'm gonna look for you know any

818
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:41,200
research

819
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:44,240
on rosemary oil and see what's been done

820
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,919
around the world on rosemary oil and

821
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,640
then the other thing that i look at

822
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,520
that's really

823
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:51,759
important is how is the research done

824
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:54,879
because we all know

825
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:57,200
if you want a particular answer you can

826
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,640
skew the way you do things to make it

827
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:03,919
happen a certain

828
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:06,720
way i i think that

829
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:07,840
how pesticides are applied is really

830
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,679
important

831
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:15,038
because a lot of pests can just be blown

832
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:16,960
off a plant with a spray of water and so

833
00:27:15,038 --> 00:27:18,798
if you're you know you're doing a trial

834
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:22,240
and you have like you're only doing

835
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:24,000
four plants um and those plants are

836
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,798
getting sprayed with the active

837
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,359
but with a good jet of water how do you

838
00:27:26,798 --> 00:27:30,000
know

839
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:31,519
it's not the mechanical means removing

840
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,640
those pests and i've had some questions

841
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:36,240
about some

842
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:38,159
you know pesticides that you know is it

843
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,599
the spraying action that removes the

844
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:42,000
pest or

845
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:44,480
was it the actual active ingredient and

846
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,558
that's why

847
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,399
when researchers today do research on

848
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:50,960
the microbial products products that

849
00:27:48,398 --> 00:27:52,398
contain like bavaria and isaiah and

850
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,759
medarisium and things like that these

851
00:27:52,398 --> 00:27:55,759
beneficial fungus

852
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:57,599
what they actually do is they isolate

853
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:58,240
the fungus out of the commercial

854
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:00,000
products

855
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,519
so it's a hundred percent pure product

856
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,720
and they're no innards

857
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:06,720
to make sure that they're applying just

858
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,880
the straight active ingredient

859
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,640
companies typically will not just

860
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,159
provide the straight active ingredient

861
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,200
so for the microbials they actually have

862
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:16,799
to isolate it

863
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:19,440
out and and look at it that way but

864
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:20,879
how they do the applications is is very

865
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,360
important too and that's the kind of

866
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,799
stuff

867
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:25,678
i look at to see like okay does this

868
00:28:24,798 --> 00:28:27,599
make sense

869
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:29,200
also you have to look at again how the

870
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:33,119
research is done

871
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:35,600
because if it is done

872
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:37,839
but again they're testing four plants in

873
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:40,079
you know a research greenhouse

874
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:42,079
the way they did that can it be ramped

875
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:44,000
up the five acres or ten acres

876
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:45,918
and sometimes it can't because

877
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,278
oftentimes researchers aren't looking at

878
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:50,000
the economics

879
00:28:47,278 --> 00:28:52,319
of doing something for past management

880
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,558
and how much it's going to cost in labor

881
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:56,158
and the reality of spray coverage

882
00:28:54,558 --> 00:28:58,000
because again research greenhouses

883
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:59,760
they're all nice and spaced out

884
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,440
and you can get full coverage from every

885
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:02,240
side and you can take time to spray

886
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,480
everything

887
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,440
where you go to any commercial facility

888
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,200
and people just like

889
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,720
running down the aisles trying to spray

890
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,558
as fast as they can

891
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,079
and you don't get the same kind of spray

892
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:13,759
coverage and and this is why

893
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:15,918
sometimes you can get one result in

894
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:18,158
research and another in real world

895
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:20,080
because of application differences

896
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:21,440
how much water is used there's so many

897
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:23,839
variables but

898
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,120
we need the research we need it from a

899
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:27,359
starting point because

900
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:28,239
if you know let's just say rosemary oil

901
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:31,439
was sprayed

902
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,798
and they saw no efficacy at all under

903
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,720
ideal conditions

904
00:29:32,798 --> 00:29:37,200
well then it's probably not going to

905
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:39,278
work under sub-ideal conditions in a

906
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,440
commercial growing facility and so

907
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:43,440
generally that's where i start and then

908
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,240
you know i i pick up my you know little

909
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,960
bug phone

910
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,759
and i call my you know university

911
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:51,600
friends

912
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:52,798
and other you know people i know

913
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:54,639
that you know have worked in the

914
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:56,158
industry for a long time with science

915
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,520
background and when we talk about you

916
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:00,399
know what are we seeing

917
00:29:57,519 --> 00:30:01,278
because you know kind of the proof is in

918
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:03,278
the pudding

919
00:30:01,278 --> 00:30:04,960
once stuff gets out to the field whether

920
00:30:03,278 --> 00:30:06,640
it's going to work or not

921
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,000
and then you know looking at all of that

922
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,440
kind of make decisions on

923
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,839
if you know with the product i should

924
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,679
recommend or not but i tell you with the

925
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:15,038
products that are targeting specific for

926
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:18,720
the cannabis industry it's

927
00:30:15,038 --> 00:30:21,119
nearly impossible to get

928
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,558
like solid research from the companies

929
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:23,839
saying here's the trial here's the

930
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:26,639
protocol we used

931
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:30,319
and here's our results it's it's it's

932
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,320
very difficult to get that kind of stuff

933
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:36,000
yeah and i remember in my talk i i went

934
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,079
to a particular website of a

935
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,319
pretty famous cannabis nutrient company

936
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:42,240
that i won't mention here on the podcast

937
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:44,000
and they had these charts that were just

938
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:47,919
incredible you know product x

939
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:50,240
causes 75 better growth and is reported

940
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:53,679
by master growers to produce

941
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:55,519
you know 50 better trichome density you

942
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:56,880
know or some some ridiculous number but

943
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:58,720
then they have no

944
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,240
uh reference to the actual study that

945
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,759
they conducted and when you

946
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,440
write to them and ask them for it they

947
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:05,119
say that that's proprietary

948
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,640
well that research really isn't useful

949
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:08,079
it probably doesn't even exist but they

950
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:11,038
had a cool bar graft

951
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:12,639
you know supposedly supporting it and

952
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:15,119
when you're looking at research

953
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,399
that's it's so tough because like you

954
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:18,000
said you actually have to look at it you

955
00:31:16,398 --> 00:31:20,239
know it may have been a researcher that

956
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,359
had four tents up you know in a

957
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,440
controlled environment

958
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:24,719
and like you said four plants or even

959
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,558
even 20 plants

960
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,000
that's a really low end value the

961
00:31:26,558 --> 00:31:30,639
statistical power of that

962
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,240
is relatively speaking is is fairly low

963
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,919
and we want to see it replicated that's

964
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,240
the thing about these trials

965
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:37,759
is we can't draw huge conclusions from

966
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,079
that we can say well

967
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:41,599
this shows a trend there's a likelihood

968
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:44,158
that because of this research

969
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:46,719
we're going to get similar results but

970
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:49,440
too many times i see people conclusively

971
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,558
cite research and and say that you know

972
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,640
this causes this

973
00:31:50,558 --> 00:31:54,398
to happen and we really have to be

974
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,480
cautious with that

975
00:31:54,398 --> 00:31:58,000
and we really have to read the research

976
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,599
really carefully

977
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,759
and like you mentioned the application

978
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:04,959
method the application rate

979
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:06,319
um on on the soil and nutrient side

980
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,600
when we talk about those sort of things

981
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:09,038
we have to look at what was already

982
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:11,759
existing in the soil

983
00:32:09,038 --> 00:32:12,319
um you know what kind of plants are they

984
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:14,398
growing

985
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:16,079
in there you know what there's just so

986
00:32:14,398 --> 00:32:17,839
many things we have to consider

987
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:19,519
uh before we draw like any hard

988
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:21,278
conclusions so

989
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:23,038
well assuming we get through this

990
00:32:21,278 --> 00:32:24,398
testing and research oh go ahead

991
00:32:23,038 --> 00:32:26,879
i was just gonna add i think one of the

992
00:32:24,398 --> 00:32:29,038
most classic you know

993
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,278
we think we know the answer and oh my

994
00:32:29,038 --> 00:32:34,000
gosh we were wrong kind of thing

995
00:32:31,278 --> 00:32:35,278
and yeah i know the cannabis industry

996
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,640
you know you guys don't use that a

997
00:32:35,278 --> 00:32:38,398
medical opinion please don't

998
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,799
send me hate mail because i said i'm at

999
00:32:38,398 --> 00:32:44,000
a cloprid but it's a really

1000
00:32:40,798 --> 00:32:45,519
good example of how research could be

1001
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,240
done by good people

1002
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:48,720
doing good things but can be wrong

1003
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,519
because

1004
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,159
of replications and what the situation

1005
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:55,679
was

1006
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:58,799
when a metacobrage it was being used

1007
00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:02,080
to uh treat pests in

1008
00:32:58,798 --> 00:33:04,158
uh the state of new york on a lot of par

1009
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:05,599
uh central the trees and central parks

1010
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:08,799
and things like that

1011
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:10,000
and what was interesting is they started

1012
00:33:08,798 --> 00:33:11,839
to notice trees that were

1013
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,720
treated with a metacloprid had a

1014
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:16,720
flare-up of spider mites afterwards that

1015
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,558
if you treat the metacloprid boom those

1016
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:21,440
plants ended up with spider mites

1017
00:33:18,558 --> 00:33:22,158
and everybody went to the conclusion

1018
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,399
that well

1019
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:26,240
because the medical over the systemic

1020
00:33:24,398 --> 00:33:28,398
that a lot of beneficials

1021
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,319
in in addition to eating the meat of the

1022
00:33:28,398 --> 00:33:32,239
insects are also plant feeders pollen

1023
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:33,278
and nectar or they drink plant juices

1024
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:36,558
and so that

1025
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:39,599
they assumed that the metacloprid was

1026
00:33:36,558 --> 00:33:40,480
killing the beneficials and this is what

1027
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:42,879
was said

1028
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,480
for a while until they started looking

1029
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,720
going back and looking closer

1030
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,919
and what they actually found is yes a

1031
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,919
medical opinion can kill

1032
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:52,240
some beneficials but that's not what was

1033
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:54,480
causing this they found that the plants

1034
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:57,519
treated with a metacloprid

1035
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:59,759
actually were basically more nutritious

1036
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:01,759
and that the spider mites that were

1037
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:03,440
feeding on these plants were like

1038
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:05,919
super spider mites it was like getting

1039
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,759
super vitamins and they were the females

1040
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:10,878
were actually laying more eggs

1041
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:13,440
and being much more productive and so it

1042
00:34:10,878 --> 00:34:16,000
was just like a metachoprid

1043
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,878
triggered the plant to feed the spider

1044
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,280
mites better

1045
00:34:16,878 --> 00:34:20,719
and so it seemed like at first a

1046
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,399
metacorporate was you know

1047
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:24,078
killing the beneficials and that was why

1048
00:34:22,398 --> 00:34:25,398
we had the might issues but it wasn't

1049
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:28,320
and so that's why we need

1050
00:34:25,398 --> 00:34:30,480
replications over and over stuff stuff

1051
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,599
has to be peer reviewed you need a lot

1052
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,679
of people putting input

1053
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:35,039
in on this and you know some great work

1054
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:36,159
university of maryland was heavily

1055
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:37,599
involved with that and they did some

1056
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:41,119
great work on that

1057
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:44,000
and and and this is what's hard

1058
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:44,879
is because it takes years to figure this

1059
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,719
stuff out

1060
00:34:44,878 --> 00:34:48,239
and you have a grower standing there

1061
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:51,598
saying my plants are dying

1062
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:53,439
uh right now i need an answer now and so

1063
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:55,519
it's it's very difficult and with the

1064
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:57,200
lack of funding going to research

1065
00:34:55,519 --> 00:34:59,039
the lack of researchers it's going to

1066
00:34:57,199 --> 00:34:59,439
get nothing but harder and harder to get

1067
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:03,599
this

1068
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:06,000
good information um out there so

1069
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:07,838
it makes me cringe when people say oh i

1070
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,920
had this pest issue i disprayed this

1071
00:35:07,838 --> 00:35:11,519
and it totally went away when the

1072
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,400
product to me in my head doesn't make

1073
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:15,599
sense

1074
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,400
and you know there could be other things

1075
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:20,079
going on

1076
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:21,440
that the growers aren't even aware of

1077
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:23,119
that's a good example i hadn't heard

1078
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,400
that one i'm not i'm not very familiar

1079
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:26,320
with like traditional

1080
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:28,240
chemistry so it's cool to hear that but

1081
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:31,280
that really does highlight the point

1082
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:33,118
that we're trying to make um but let's

1083
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,320
just assume that we get through all of

1084
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:35,519
this process and you're like

1085
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,760
you know i still want to give this

1086
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:40,000
product a shot

1087
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,440
that's where it comes to testing it out

1088
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,800
using controls

1089
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:47,119
and determining if the product is valid

1090
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:49,839
can you talk a little bit about how you

1091
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:51,599
would set up a trial or a test

1092
00:35:49,838 --> 00:35:52,880
let's just say in a really small grow

1093
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:54,960
just to make it simple

1094
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:57,519
how would you how would you isolate for

1095
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:59,358
a product x to determine if it is a

1096
00:35:57,519 --> 00:36:02,639
controlling variable or not

1097
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:04,159
well and this is challenging because

1098
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:06,000
i mean i think growers need to test

1099
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:09,039
products don't get me wrong

1100
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,800
and many of my larger greenhouse

1101
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:13,039
facilities they actually have their own

1102
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:15,680
in-house research people to do this

1103
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:20,000
stuff but most cannabis facilities don't

1104
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:21,919
um the problem is is oftentimes

1105
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,239
because the plants are so valuable in

1106
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:26,079
cannabis you can't afford to sacrifice

1107
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:28,159
you know five plants and just say hey

1108
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:30,320
we're not going to treat these plants

1109
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:32,799
where with poinsettias and mums it's

1110
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:35,920
super easy to sacrifice a few plants

1111
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:40,079
so that creates a challenge in itself um

1112
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:42,800
also if those plants um

1113
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:43,280
if you're not treating them they can

1114
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,519
become

1115
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:47,119
a problem for the pest and you know

1116
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:49,199
often your pest numbers spike on those

1117
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:52,320
plants and spread to other plants

1118
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:54,239
now you can cage plants um

1119
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,920
and this is something that's often done

1120
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:58,078
i've got you know like a dozen cages

1121
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:00,240
here at my house that i put plants in

1122
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:01,280
um they have little you know zip windows

1123
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:02,639
on them um

1124
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,800
if you ever need them you get them from

1125
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:06,078
bioquip out in california

1126
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,920
and what you can do is you can put your

1127
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:09,119
plants inside of there and then you zip

1128
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:12,559
them closed

1129
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:14,880
and that way they're isolated because

1130
00:37:12,559 --> 00:37:16,000
what one of the biggest problems you

1131
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,358
have when

1132
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,119
you know let's say you have a plant

1133
00:37:17,358 --> 00:37:21,440
covered with aphids and you want to test

1134
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:23,358
if products x will kill them

1135
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,880
what happens if ladybugs show up what

1136
00:37:23,358 --> 00:37:26,559
happens if lace wings show up

1137
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,480
what happens if a natural occurring

1138
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:29,679
fungus show up and and that can really

1139
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:32,000
mess your trial up

1140
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:33,519
and so the cages will help exclude

1141
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,079
beneficials from getting

1142
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:37,199
in there but it also can create a

1143
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:40,320
microclimate

1144
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:40,799
when you're treating those plants um so

1145
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,880
it

1146
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:48,320
it can be challenging um

1147
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:50,480
i think that with growers

1148
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:52,000
if they have a good scout and a good

1149
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,880
pest management program you know they

1150
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,239
can tag

1151
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:56,480
certain plants they're not going to

1152
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:57,358
treat and then tag certain plants they

1153
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,880
are going to treat

1154
00:37:57,358 --> 00:38:00,400
but they have to be under the same

1155
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:02,400
environmental conditions

1156
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:04,160
they have to be on the same nutrients i

1157
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:07,280
mean they have to be identical

1158
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:09,358
in all ways to see if the product's

1159
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:11,200
going to work for them

1160
00:38:09,358 --> 00:38:13,119
but it's very difficult if you're going

1161
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:14,399
to go spray these plants but not those

1162
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:17,119
over there spray drift

1163
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,559
because spray drift pesticides drift

1164
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:21,358
further than people

1165
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:22,078
often realize and so that can be very

1166
00:38:21,358 --> 00:38:24,639
challenging

1167
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:26,079
and and this is why a lot of people just

1168
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:26,960
are like let the universities do the

1169
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:28,720
work and then

1170
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,400
you know because they've got the set up

1171
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:31,679
they have research greenhouses they have

1172
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,599
growth chambers they have all this

1173
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:36,159
isolated stuff to be able to do this

1174
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:37,440
but again in the cannabis situation it's

1175
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:40,399
not so easy

1176
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:42,000
um you need to watch the hemp research

1177
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,920
because you know virginia tech's doing a

1178
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,599
lot on hemp colorado state's doing a lot

1179
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,358
on hemp cornell has gotten a chunk of

1180
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:49,119
money to do research on hemp

1181
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:50,480
and you know there will be papers being

1182
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:53,358
published

1183
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,400
coming out on that from those

1184
00:38:53,358 --> 00:38:55,838
universities

1185
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,519
but as far as a grower setting

1186
00:38:55,838 --> 00:38:58,159
withdrawal i mean i hate to say it but i

1187
00:38:57,519 --> 00:39:01,519
don't think

1188
00:38:58,159 --> 00:39:03,759
most cannabis growers are in a position

1189
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:06,400
to necessarily

1190
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,960
test products without really focusing on

1191
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,760
that

1192
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:11,280
and maybe having an isolated area to do

1193
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:13,200
it in

1194
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,720
or to be able to space their plants at

1195
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:16,000
because cannabis growers tend to grow

1196
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:18,480
really tight

1197
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,159
and you know if your plants are touching

1198
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,000
and one's getting sprayed and one's not

1199
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:23,759
again the pesticide is going to end up

1200
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,960
on the other one

1201
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,520
you can let's say you wanted to test a

1202
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,760
product

1203
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:30,719
for spider mites let's say and if you

1204
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:33,680
have

1205
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:34,000
several infected leaves and you can kind

1206
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:35,838
of

1207
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,519
look at those leaves and then if you

1208
00:39:35,838 --> 00:39:39,440
carefully spray them

1209
00:39:37,519 --> 00:39:41,119
with the pesticide product and then wait

1210
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:43,280
24 hours and come back and look you can

1211
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:46,320
get an idea of what's going on

1212
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:47,839
but what's difficult about that is think

1213
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,119
about if you're just going to spray one

1214
00:39:47,838 --> 00:39:50,400
leaf compared to spraying

1215
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:52,240
a plant and you're going to end up with

1216
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,880
a lot more active ingredient

1217
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:56,000
on that leaf than you would if you're

1218
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:59,119
spraying a whole plant

1219
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,960
and so it kind of skews you know

1220
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:03,200
the reality of how you really spray

1221
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,760
compared to a trial spray there so

1222
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:07,199
that's

1223
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:09,520
you know it's a difficult thing to do

1224
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:10,399
i think the biggest mistake growers make

1225
00:40:09,519 --> 00:40:13,440
is they don't

1226
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:15,599
assess well after they use a product and

1227
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:17,760
report back what they see you know

1228
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:19,599
before they spray you know if they found

1229
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:21,119
let's say 10 spiderman eggs per leaf

1230
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:24,318
they come through they spray product

1231
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:27,358
x and they come back if those

1232
00:40:24,318 --> 00:40:29,440
eggs have hatched out in a few days then

1233
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:30,719
the product didn't work if the eggs are

1234
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,800
dead well

1235
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:35,439
then you know the product worked so it's

1236
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:37,039
that follow-up and scouting

1237
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,880
after you've done treatments i think is

1238
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:40,559
really critical and using the sticky

1239
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:43,599
cards to monitor numbers will really

1240
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:46,639
help evaluate a product

1241
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:48,318
i know that was a lot i'm sorry

1242
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:50,239
no it's it's interesting because i don't

1243
00:40:48,318 --> 00:40:50,800
look at it from a pest perspective like

1244
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:52,239
you do so

1245
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,560
that's why i'm glad i'm doing this

1246
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:55,919
podcast with you uh one other factor or

1247
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:57,679
variable i want to mention

1248
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,119
with specific specifically with

1249
00:40:57,679 --> 00:41:01,679
pesticides is the

1250
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:03,680
sprayer itself that's the whole world

1251
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:06,799
too in terms of particle size and

1252
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:07,679
and dispersion and oh all of that i mean

1253
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,400
what a nightmare

1254
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:11,039
um yeah i think so michael brownbridge

1255
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,440
i'm not sure

1256
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:14,880
i think he said this on one of the

1257
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:18,480
webinars we did

1258
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:21,280
you know where you know you can have um

1259
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:22,719
a bad product and a good sprayer and

1260
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:25,200
it's not going to

1261
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:26,879
work but if you have a good product and

1262
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:27,519
a bad sprayer it's definitely not going

1263
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:31,119
to work

1264
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:33,759
so the sprayers can

1265
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:35,440
make all the difference in the world and

1266
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,319
i've had several people tell me that

1267
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:38,800
once they've

1268
00:41:36,318 --> 00:41:40,159
gone from paint sprayers cement sprayers

1269
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,400
you know the home depot

1270
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:43,279
special backpack sprayer to you know

1271
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,358
commercial

1272
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,800
sprayers the right nozzles it's made

1273
00:41:45,358 --> 00:41:49,279
it's made their products work

1274
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,800
that much better especially with the

1275
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:53,839
horticultural oils

1276
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,640
because you can't have big gloppy droppy

1277
00:41:53,838 --> 00:41:57,759
particles

1278
00:41:54,639 --> 00:41:58,480
you need a fine almost aerosol mist on

1279
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:02,720
those leaves

1280
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:05,599
with the oils so let's just say that

1281
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:06,239
testing out pesticides has numerous

1282
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:09,359
challenges

1283
00:42:06,239 --> 00:42:12,639
for the average person or average grower

1284
00:42:09,358 --> 00:42:14,400
uh just to simplify this point though

1285
00:42:12,639 --> 00:42:15,679
uh i'm gonna pick something like

1286
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,160
lighting for example

1287
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:19,519
so let's say we wanted to compare four

1288
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:23,118
different types of lighting

1289
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:23,599
we could throw you know 10 to 15 plants

1290
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:26,400
under

1291
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:27,359
a particular brand of double-ended hps

1292
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:31,119
lights another one

1293
00:42:27,358 --> 00:42:32,000
under a particular led brand and vice

1294
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:33,920
versa and keep them

1295
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,599
in separate you know in separate tents

1296
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:37,838
or separate rooms to where

1297
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:39,359
all all the plants are exactly the same

1298
00:42:37,838 --> 00:42:40,880
which means we're running the exact same

1299
00:42:39,358 --> 00:42:42,719
cultivar we can't compare

1300
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:44,400
different cultivars and then do a yield

1301
00:42:42,719 --> 00:42:45,358
comparison at the end because that's not

1302
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,119
going to be accurate

1303
00:42:45,358 --> 00:42:48,719
they need to be cloned plants if we want

1304
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:49,760
to talk about them being genetically

1305
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:51,838
identical

1306
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:53,040
and of identical health and identical

1307
00:42:51,838 --> 00:42:54,318
height and then

1308
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:56,159
you know a good scientific experiment

1309
00:42:54,318 --> 00:42:57,440
would actually randomize those clones so

1310
00:42:56,159 --> 00:42:58,719
you wouldn't say oh these five are going

1311
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,480
to go into this

1312
00:42:58,719 --> 00:43:02,239
you know into this under this light you

1313
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,760
would actually do a random number

1314
00:43:02,239 --> 00:43:05,279
generator and give each plant a number

1315
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,880
and then pull those out that way and do

1316
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:09,760
it to really randomize

1317
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:11,119
things as much as possible and then uh

1318
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:12,160
all the you know everything would be the

1319
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:14,000
same across the board

1320
00:43:12,159 --> 00:43:15,358
and then assuming you've controlled for

1321
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,800
all those variables that would at least

1322
00:43:15,358 --> 00:43:18,400
give you idea that your plants are going

1323
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,480
to yield

1324
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:22,000
a prod this particular cultivar we can't

1325
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,960
even make assumptions across a variety

1326
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,960
of cultivars

1327
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,000
right you know would yield a certain

1328
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,760
amount or have this

1329
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,760
level of health or this level of growth

1330
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,800
under this particular light or lighting

1331
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:33,440
spectrum

1332
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,800
and you know even with a simple example

1333
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,519
like that it gets challenging because

1334
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,039
well

1335
00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:38,239
you know the double-ended hps light

1336
00:43:37,039 --> 00:43:39,920
you're going to have different heat

1337
00:43:38,239 --> 00:43:42,078
requirements so that's going to change

1338
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:43,440
the environment of the room

1339
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:45,039
which is going to have to be accounted

1340
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,400
for we can't just assume that all the

1341
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:48,480
rooms are going to need the exact same

1342
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:50,240
requirements based on the lighting and

1343
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:52,240
you know just trying to pick the

1344
00:43:50,239 --> 00:43:53,838
simplest of examples

1345
00:43:52,239 --> 00:43:55,279
you can find is quite challenging and

1346
00:43:53,838 --> 00:43:57,920
when we start looking at

1347
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:59,760
you know uh bottled nutrients or our

1348
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:01,119
fertilizers

1349
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:03,040
we have to know what's in the media

1350
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:04,400
already so we know our starting point

1351
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:06,400
and if we're starting from a completely

1352
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:07,599
inert media like rockwool for example

1353
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,200
that makes it quite easy

1354
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:10,960
but on the organic side that's not

1355
00:44:09,199 --> 00:44:13,439
really ideal um

1356
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:14,720
and so then we have to start looking at

1357
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:17,119
you know adding

1358
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:18,159
this product is it actually is it making

1359
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:19,680
a difference

1360
00:44:18,159 --> 00:44:21,279
is everything else the same and then we

1361
00:44:19,679 --> 00:44:23,838
you know we have a program

1362
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,319
that's our you know sort of our control

1363
00:44:23,838 --> 00:44:27,039
and then

1364
00:44:24,318 --> 00:44:27,838
we add product x to a certain number of

1365
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:30,400
plants

1366
00:44:27,838 --> 00:44:30,960
uh and we get this sort of a response

1367
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,400
and

1368
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,000
based on that response then i would go

1369
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,639
back again and test it again and say

1370
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,318
okay

1371
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:40,639
well was it this what was the the

1372
00:44:38,318 --> 00:44:42,400
controlling mechanism of action in this

1373
00:44:40,639 --> 00:44:44,159
product that made this occur

1374
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,920
or was it something really specific to

1375
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:47,920
this product was it adding

1376
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:49,680
nitrogen phosphorus whatever macro

1377
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,000
micronutrient and then i would try

1378
00:44:49,679 --> 00:44:52,719
another

1379
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,400
experiment adding just that that micro

1380
00:44:52,719 --> 00:44:55,358
or macronutrient to see if i could do it

1381
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,960
more affordably

1382
00:44:55,358 --> 00:44:58,559
or get that same response to know if it

1383
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:00,079
really is the product or really is a

1384
00:44:58,559 --> 00:45:00,880
particular nutrient that's a limiting

1385
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:04,240
factor

1386
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:05,838
in my grow so it it's sort of this

1387
00:45:04,239 --> 00:45:09,039
never-ending

1388
00:45:05,838 --> 00:45:10,960
uh fairly sophisticated uh

1389
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:12,559
way of thinking that will allow you to

1390
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:15,039
improve your garden but also

1391
00:45:12,559 --> 00:45:16,480
sort of get a better idea of how a

1392
00:45:15,039 --> 00:45:19,199
product is performing for you

1393
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:20,639
right and and you know you'll it's easy

1394
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:23,279
i don't think it's easy but

1395
00:45:20,639 --> 00:45:24,239
you know historically it's easier to

1396
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:28,560
find research

1397
00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:31,279
on let's say i will call a soil with no

1398
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:32,880
microbial or nutrient activity like rock

1399
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:35,440
wool

1400
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,920
and to do nutrient research on that is

1401
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,240
way

1402
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:40,318
easier because as you mentioned all the

1403
00:45:38,239 --> 00:45:40,879
variables that go into a living soil

1404
00:45:40,318 --> 00:45:42,719
because

1405
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:44,480
is there a micro beating another microbe

1406
00:45:42,719 --> 00:45:46,000
that processes this other nutrient that

1407
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:48,559
then binding something up

1408
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,920
and it's so complex and that's why with

1409
00:45:48,559 --> 00:45:52,239
the bio control

1410
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,039
you see way more pesticide trials

1411
00:45:52,239 --> 00:45:54,639
because

1412
00:45:53,039 --> 00:45:57,119
you know here's the leaf spray it is the

1413
00:45:54,639 --> 00:45:57,759
bug dead yes when it comes to bio

1414
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:00,559
control

1415
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:01,040
it's so complex because you know if you

1416
00:46:00,559 --> 00:46:03,279
have

1417
00:46:01,039 --> 00:46:04,079
i think a classic example is a rogue

1418
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:06,480
beetle

1419
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:08,160
okay here you've got a rogue beetle and

1420
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:09,358
you know on its normal day at work it's

1421
00:46:08,159 --> 00:46:11,279
cruising through the soil and it's like

1422
00:46:09,358 --> 00:46:12,960
oh i like to eat fungus gnats and oh it

1423
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,560
likes to eat thrips pupa

1424
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,400
and you know it's still kind of this

1425
00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:18,239
weird thing about root aphids because

1426
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,838
i've seen people put buckets of them out

1427
00:46:18,239 --> 00:46:20,318
and they still have massive root aphids

1428
00:46:19,838 --> 00:46:22,239
but

1429
00:46:20,318 --> 00:46:24,559
if you take that rogue beetle and starve

1430
00:46:22,239 --> 00:46:26,719
it for 24 hours and put in a petri dish

1431
00:46:24,559 --> 00:46:28,159
under a you know trial setting and throw

1432
00:46:26,719 --> 00:46:31,519
some root aphids in there

1433
00:46:28,159 --> 00:46:35,440
it will eat it and so what it does

1434
00:46:31,519 --> 00:46:37,519
in a petri dish these living organisms

1435
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,480
in this sterile environment is going to

1436
00:46:37,519 --> 00:46:41,759
be different than

1437
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:45,280
what happens out in these living systems

1438
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:45,680
and so that's why some of the research

1439
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:47,359
that

1440
00:46:45,679 --> 00:46:49,279
is done and that's why i always look to

1441
00:46:47,358 --> 00:46:52,400
see how it's done you know

1442
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:54,480
if if are they given a food choice

1443
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:56,160
and you know if you saw it eating the

1444
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:57,599
petri dish does that really mean it's

1445
00:46:56,159 --> 00:46:58,159
going to go eat it out in the wild when

1446
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:00,720
it's given

1447
00:46:58,159 --> 00:47:02,159
all these other things to feed on so

1448
00:47:00,719 --> 00:47:03,358
again this is why it's important to

1449
00:47:02,159 --> 00:47:06,480
understand

1450
00:47:03,358 --> 00:47:09,759
how the research is actually done

1451
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:10,639
not just did it kill it or not because

1452
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,640
i've seen

1453
00:47:10,639 --> 00:47:14,639
a lot of expensive i don't know if the

1454
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:17,679
words mistakes but a lot of people using

1455
00:47:14,639 --> 00:47:19,358
products that

1456
00:47:17,679 --> 00:47:22,480
we knew weren't going to work in a

1457
00:47:19,358 --> 00:47:24,558
growing growers setting

1458
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,519
even though they got results under a

1459
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:28,000
controlled

1460
00:47:25,519 --> 00:47:29,519
lab setting so it's very important to

1461
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,960
look and see how they've done that

1462
00:47:29,519 --> 00:47:33,119
research and even though

1463
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:34,960
you know microbes aren't necessarily

1464
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:35,519
getting up and walking away kind of

1465
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:38,079
thing they

1466
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:41,199
are a living thing that interacts with

1467
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:41,200
the environment around it

1468
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,719
yeah that brings up a good point um

1469
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:48,079
and the way i'd like to highlight this

1470
00:47:46,719 --> 00:47:49,118
point is actually kind of funny because

1471
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:52,720
it's sort of how i

1472
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:55,039
met you it was at uh photo x and

1473
00:47:52,719 --> 00:47:56,558
we were talking i don't i don't think i

1474
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:58,400
brought it up but somehow we got on the

1475
00:47:56,559 --> 00:48:01,519
topic of compost teas

1476
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:03,760
and uh i know that that was sort of a

1477
00:48:01,519 --> 00:48:05,519
maybe it still is a little bit of a of a

1478
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:06,000
trigger for you in some ways because i

1479
00:48:05,519 --> 00:48:07,920
know there's

1480
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,519
a lot of claims being out there out

1481
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:11,119
there being made about compost teas that

1482
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:12,880
are just frankly not accurate

1483
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:14,880
you know especially things relating to

1484
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:17,358
insects and bugs like i sprayed

1485
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:19,119
compost tea and now my soil you know i

1486
00:48:17,358 --> 00:48:20,880
did a drench i no longer have fusarium

1487
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:23,440
or i no longer

1488
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:25,119
have pests it repels the pests or makes

1489
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:26,480
the plant so healthy that it's now

1490
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:29,200
immune to pests or

1491
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:30,880
you know a variety of things and for you

1492
00:48:29,199 --> 00:48:33,759
i realized that that is uh

1493
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:34,000
obviously something that would would set

1494
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,680
you

1495
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,039
off or or you don't like that i don't

1496
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:38,960
want to say i'm set

1497
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:40,400
off you made me sound like i'm a crazy

1498
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:43,119
lady

1499
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:45,119
no no no no i just i remember when you

1500
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:46,800
met me i somehow you found out that i

1501
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:48,559
had something to do with compost teas

1502
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:50,240
and i remember having it being

1503
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:52,400
we had a longer it actually was good

1504
00:48:50,239 --> 00:48:55,199
because it sparked a longer conversation

1505
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:57,039
where i got to explain to you like hey i

1506
00:48:55,199 --> 00:48:59,919
i agree with a lot of what you're saying

1507
00:48:57,039 --> 00:49:01,519
because compost tea being a you know a

1508
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:03,680
microbial product

1509
00:49:01,519 --> 00:49:04,559
that is so varied every batch is

1510
00:49:03,679 --> 00:49:06,480
different

1511
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:08,240
there isn't a good way to scientifically

1512
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:10,480
control for it and study it

1513
00:49:08,239 --> 00:49:11,919
um so it would be very hard to get

1514
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:13,519
peer-reviewed research and even if we

1515
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:14,880
got any i wouldn't trust it anyway

1516
00:49:13,519 --> 00:49:16,480
because the batch that i make

1517
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:18,640
in my garden is going to be so different

1518
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:20,240
than what that study made

1519
00:49:18,639 --> 00:49:21,759
that it doesn't really carry a lot of

1520
00:49:20,239 --> 00:49:24,399
weight and

1521
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:25,760
to make claims around it then would be

1522
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:28,000
very challenging

1523
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:30,079
because every batch is different and you

1524
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,800
do have so many different

1525
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:34,480
things going on in terms of the the

1526
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:37,280
microbial interactions

1527
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:39,119
even using very controlled inputs that

1528
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:40,960
uh

1529
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:42,880
to me that kind of highlights it i i

1530
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:44,480
definitely uh don't want to throw you

1531
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:46,000
under the bus here i just thought that

1532
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,800
was a good example of sort of the

1533
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,280
diversity

1534
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:50,559
and inability to really control or study

1535
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,119
something when we talk about living

1536
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:53,280
systems

1537
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:56,838
right well and i think what i get upset

1538
00:49:53,280 --> 00:50:00,720
about not triggered but upset is

1539
00:49:56,838 --> 00:50:01,279
because i i it's not that i'm ever going

1540
00:50:00,719 --> 00:50:04,558
to say

1541
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:07,040
compost tea is a bad thing my issue

1542
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:08,800
is is the claims that are being made

1543
00:50:07,039 --> 00:50:09,358
spray this and you won't have pest

1544
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,680
issues

1545
00:50:09,358 --> 00:50:13,199
do this and you won't have that without

1546
00:50:11,679 --> 00:50:15,358
anything really to back it up

1547
00:50:13,199 --> 00:50:17,118
and you know always this question of

1548
00:50:15,358 --> 00:50:18,960
well how do you know you're not brewing

1549
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:23,039
pathogens because

1550
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:26,079
same thing with you know insects

1551
00:50:23,039 --> 00:50:27,039
it's a matter of opinion if something is

1552
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:29,280
good or bad

1553
00:50:27,039 --> 00:50:30,079
and a compost is not sentient to sit

1554
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:32,160
there and say

1555
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:33,839
well today i'm only going to brew the

1556
00:50:32,159 --> 00:50:34,480
healthy stuff but i'm going to make sure

1557
00:50:33,838 --> 00:50:36,239
that you know

1558
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:38,960
all the the plant pathogens and

1559
00:50:36,239 --> 00:50:40,479
pathogens die it can't do that

1560
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:42,559
i mean there's definite things you can

1561
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:43,199
do you know controlling your inputs and

1562
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:45,519
all that

1563
00:50:43,199 --> 00:50:46,719
to i would say steer the boat a certain

1564
00:50:45,519 --> 00:50:50,400
direction

1565
00:50:46,719 --> 00:50:53,439
but it's it's this idea of

1566
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:56,480
black and white does not exist

1567
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:59,280
in in really in a lot of the stuff we're

1568
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:01,519
talking about there's so much gray area

1569
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:03,440
and the question is is does the benefit

1570
00:51:01,519 --> 00:51:06,480
outweigh the risk

1571
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:09,679
and the idea that a pesticide

1572
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:10,960
a compost tea again is only going to do

1573
00:51:09,679 --> 00:51:13,279
amazing things

1574
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:14,800
and never do anything bad i mean i would

1575
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:16,800
say the same thing of you know even

1576
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:18,559
pesticides and bio control agents

1577
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:20,400
because even sometimes bio control

1578
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:22,720
agents do naughty things

1579
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:23,680
you know lace wings they're awesome and

1580
00:51:22,719 --> 00:51:25,838
they kick ass

1581
00:51:23,679 --> 00:51:27,199
but will they feed on other beneficials

1582
00:51:25,838 --> 00:51:30,159
absolutely

1583
00:51:27,199 --> 00:51:32,960
you know so there's no absolute in

1584
00:51:30,159 --> 00:51:35,279
defining this stuff and i think that

1585
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:36,240
with the compost seat we are just not

1586
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:39,280
there yet

1587
00:51:36,239 --> 00:51:39,838
in understanding them and for most

1588
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:43,680
people

1589
00:51:39,838 --> 00:51:45,440
i think the risk can be challenging

1590
00:51:43,679 --> 00:51:47,118
or the risk is too high that they're

1591
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:50,240
going to screw up or

1592
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:53,119
get something wrong in there especially

1593
00:51:50,239 --> 00:51:53,838
if you're doing edible things like micro

1594
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:55,920
greens

1595
00:51:53,838 --> 00:51:58,239
i mean you get any you know human

1596
00:51:55,920 --> 00:52:00,000
pathogens in there

1597
00:51:58,239 --> 00:52:01,519
you know there goes your whole crop and

1598
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,519
possibly your whole business i mean you

1599
00:52:01,519 --> 00:52:05,759
look at the recalls that happen

1600
00:52:03,519 --> 00:52:06,719
because of foodborne illnesses and i can

1601
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:09,119
already hear everybody saying well

1602
00:52:06,719 --> 00:52:11,679
that's factory farming

1603
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:13,358
it still can happen i you know you just

1604
00:52:11,679 --> 00:52:16,239
don't hear about the smaller

1605
00:52:13,358 --> 00:52:17,598
issues with it so that's it i'm not

1606
00:52:16,239 --> 00:52:19,838
going to say accomplice is bad

1607
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:21,359
i just don't think we're there yet in

1608
00:52:19,838 --> 00:52:24,318
the understanding

1609
00:52:21,358 --> 00:52:26,159
and it is not the miracle cure that i

1610
00:52:24,318 --> 00:52:29,599
hear so many people

1611
00:52:26,159 --> 00:52:31,598
you know spouting granted you know

1612
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:33,440
is it hurting the environment to do it

1613
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:35,039
no but i'd much rather have people do

1614
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:36,400
that than just dumping out pounds and

1615
00:52:35,039 --> 00:52:37,679
pounds of pounds of synthetic

1616
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:39,599
fertilizer not knowing what they're

1617
00:52:37,679 --> 00:52:43,440
doing absolutely

1618
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:46,240
but my job is to give you know

1619
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:47,039
make the growers successful and you know

1620
00:52:46,239 --> 00:52:51,358
i just

1621
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:52,880
it's you know it's inconsistent so

1622
00:52:51,358 --> 00:52:55,199
so two thoughts on that one i just want

1623
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:58,000
to be clear i have not heard of any

1624
00:52:55,199 --> 00:53:00,000
um any of these outbreaks being caused

1625
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:03,039
specifically by compost tea

1626
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,079
uh no in regards to that so i just want

1627
00:53:03,039 --> 00:53:05,440
to just want to throw that out there so

1628
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:06,720
people don't necessarily make that

1629
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,760
correlation i think there is that

1630
00:53:06,719 --> 00:53:09,759
possibility

1631
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:11,200
if it's brewed improperly or contains

1632
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:13,599
pathogens but i just

1633
00:53:11,199 --> 00:53:15,679
you know usually hear about a you know

1634
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:17,920
some sort of uh

1635
00:53:15,679 --> 00:53:19,838
you know uh dairy up the road that's you

1636
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:20,079
know putting out a bunch of stuff into

1637
00:53:19,838 --> 00:53:21,519
the

1638
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:22,960
end of the water supply and you know

1639
00:53:21,519 --> 00:53:24,400
manure and stuff like that and that's

1640
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,960
where the e coli comes from but who

1641
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:28,000
knows

1642
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:30,079
wild pigs and bird poop i mean there's

1643
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,838
and you know they like to you know

1644
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:33,280
workers potentially could spread it too

1645
00:53:31,838 --> 00:53:35,199
but i've heard some stories about

1646
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:36,480
animals are one and it's stuff you can't

1647
00:53:35,199 --> 00:53:39,118
control and that's why

1648
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:39,599
um you know they have all these falconer

1649
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:42,640
guys

1650
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:43,359
now that have the birds flying around to

1651
00:53:42,639 --> 00:53:45,838
chase

1652
00:53:43,358 --> 00:53:49,119
the little birds uh out of the field so

1653
00:53:45,838 --> 00:53:51,358
they don't poop in the fields

1654
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:52,720
yeah and i just my last point i want to

1655
00:53:51,358 --> 00:53:54,239
make on compost tea would be i would

1656
00:53:52,719 --> 00:53:55,679
argue that you say we're not there yet i

1657
00:53:54,239 --> 00:53:58,239
don't know that we will ever be able to

1658
00:53:55,679 --> 00:54:00,719
understand that level of complexity

1659
00:53:58,239 --> 00:54:02,399
um or control it i think that uh just

1660
00:54:00,719 --> 00:54:04,078
like with our soils i don't think that

1661
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:05,760
that's something that we'll ever

1662
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:07,680
fully understand or be able to control

1663
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:09,839
because it is so complex

1664
00:54:07,679 --> 00:54:11,519
when we start talking about microbiology

1665
00:54:09,838 --> 00:54:12,880
you know a hundred are you wrong

1666
00:54:11,519 --> 00:54:16,000
a hundred years ago they probably didn't

1667
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:19,119
think we'd be on the moon in the 60s

1668
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:22,639
so you know just saying

1669
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:25,680
i you know i mean i agree to disagree

1670
00:54:22,639 --> 00:54:29,199
and you know what with all the

1671
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:30,399
genetic work that's coming on where

1672
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:32,159
you know we're going to be able to do

1673
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:33,838
tests to see if things are present by

1674
00:54:32,159 --> 00:54:35,279
looking for presence of the dna we're

1675
00:54:33,838 --> 00:54:37,759
going to be able to understand

1676
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:39,119
a lot more um it's probably not going to

1677
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:40,720
be in our lifetime

1678
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:42,960
but you know i think we're going to come

1679
00:54:40,719 --> 00:54:45,838
a lot further and you know i do

1680
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:46,880
believe that you know having all these

1681
00:54:45,838 --> 00:54:48,639
microbial

1682
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:49,920
interactions are really important but

1683
00:54:48,639 --> 00:54:50,558
again at the end of the day i got a

1684
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,318
grower

1685
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:54,079
that's got to produce a crop by a

1686
00:54:52,318 --> 00:54:56,079
certain date and if you know

1687
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:57,519
on flowers and stuff if those aren't you

1688
00:54:56,079 --> 00:54:59,039
know in bud

1689
00:54:57,519 --> 00:55:01,280
ready to bloom like three days before

1690
00:54:59,039 --> 00:55:03,759
mother's day it's a problem

1691
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:07,839
and so in those kinds of situations it's

1692
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:10,000
just not been consistent enough

1693
00:55:07,838 --> 00:55:12,159
sure i get that i understand the desire

1694
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,760
to control every aspect of the process

1695
00:55:12,159 --> 00:55:14,798
it certainly makes things easier in a

1696
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:16,319
lot of ways

1697
00:55:14,798 --> 00:55:18,880
um and that's one of the challenges with

1698
00:55:16,318 --> 00:55:20,798
organics and living soils and

1699
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:22,160
farming in general is there so many

1700
00:55:20,798 --> 00:55:24,239
things that are out of our control or

1701
00:55:22,159 --> 00:55:26,480
we're letting go of control of when we

1702
00:55:24,239 --> 00:55:28,479
start using you know or utilizing

1703
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:29,760
uh the microbial loop or nutrient

1704
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:32,240
cycling through

1705
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:34,079
through these microbes or even waiting

1706
00:55:32,239 --> 00:55:36,239
for your native beneficials to show

1707
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:38,000
up instead of spraying you know sitting

1708
00:55:36,239 --> 00:55:39,439
there biting your nails you know when's

1709
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,960
the oreo's going to arrive when's the

1710
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:42,720
oreos going to arrive and waiting for it

1711
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:43,519
to happen it's the same kind of thing

1712
00:55:42,719 --> 00:55:47,118
and you just

1713
00:55:43,519 --> 00:55:48,159
hope that all the mother nature's aligns

1714
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:50,240
to work

1715
00:55:48,159 --> 00:55:51,838
like it's supposed to um it's nerve

1716
00:55:50,239 --> 00:55:53,039
wracking there's no doubt about it but

1717
00:55:51,838 --> 00:55:54,880
you know i do

1718
00:55:53,039 --> 00:55:56,558
believe this is the right way we're

1719
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:59,440
going um again i am

1720
00:55:56,559 --> 00:56:00,319
not anti-compost tea and i i'll say this

1721
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:01,760
again i'm

1722
00:56:00,318 --> 00:56:03,039
not a compost these specialists so i

1723
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:04,799
don't know why you dragged me into these

1724
00:56:03,039 --> 00:56:07,920
conversations

1725
00:56:04,798 --> 00:56:10,559
but i just i've been around it enough

1726
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:13,838
and the claims that again people make

1727
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:15,920
these claims and can't back any of it up

1728
00:56:13,838 --> 00:56:17,759
i think i brought it up because uh i

1729
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:20,000
know like as someone who's

1730
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:22,079
worked in that industry for a long time

1731
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:24,639
and is considered by a lot of people to

1732
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:26,000
be fairly knowledgeable on the topic

1733
00:56:24,639 --> 00:56:29,440
because that's sort of where i cut my

1734
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:31,679
teeth in the whole you know agricultural

1735
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:32,559
growing horticulture world through my

1736
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:34,318
father

1737
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:35,920
was learning how to use a microscope and

1738
00:56:34,318 --> 00:56:37,199
learning about compost tea it was kind

1739
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:39,280
of where i got thrown in

1740
00:56:37,199 --> 00:56:40,558
and so meeting you and seeing your

1741
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:41,119
reaction which was actually really

1742
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:43,920
common

1743
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:45,838
um when you talk to people who come from

1744
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:47,358
an academic background

1745
00:56:45,838 --> 00:56:49,039
it was good to have that conversation

1746
00:56:47,358 --> 00:56:50,480
and realize that we actually shared a

1747
00:56:49,039 --> 00:56:54,400
lot of the same views

1748
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:55,679
um around around compost teas

1749
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:57,519
that was sort of what i was getting at

1750
00:56:55,679 --> 00:57:00,719
but there's so many snake oil

1751
00:56:57,519 --> 00:57:01,920
you know thoughts about it uh that i i

1752
00:57:00,719 --> 00:57:03,039
totally understood where you're coming

1753
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:04,720
from and that's where that product

1754
00:57:03,039 --> 00:57:05,838
evaluation i think really comes in

1755
00:57:04,719 --> 00:57:07,598
right right and i think i mean to be

1756
00:57:05,838 --> 00:57:09,199
honest we're on the same page on this

1757
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:10,720
except for where we're gonna be in a

1758
00:57:09,199 --> 00:57:13,118
hundred years because i think we'll

1759
00:57:10,719 --> 00:57:15,039
we'll we're gonna learn a lot more um

1760
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:17,519
and i don't see you

1761
00:57:15,039 --> 00:57:19,759
out there saying oh if you spray compost

1762
00:57:17,519 --> 00:57:22,318
tea you'll never have pesticide

1763
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:23,520
or oh if you spray compost tea you know

1764
00:57:22,318 --> 00:57:25,358
your yield will be

1765
00:57:23,519 --> 00:57:27,519
ten times hot you know i don't see you

1766
00:57:25,358 --> 00:57:29,519
making those claims you're living within

1767
00:57:27,519 --> 00:57:34,079
side of the realms of reality

1768
00:57:29,519 --> 00:57:35,679
um not trying to push a product

1769
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:37,839
sure and i want to stay friends with you

1770
00:57:35,679 --> 00:57:37,838
too

1771
00:57:38,159 --> 00:57:41,920
so just on the for the sake of this

1772
00:57:40,239 --> 00:57:42,318
podcast and not letting it get too long

1773
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:44,079
uh

1774
00:57:42,318 --> 00:57:46,639
i there were a couple things i wanted to

1775
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:48,000
highlight uh specifically because

1776
00:57:46,639 --> 00:57:49,598
uh what we've been talking about has

1777
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,960
been really general in terms of

1778
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:54,240
evaluating products

1779
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:56,079
but um it definitely varies depending on

1780
00:57:54,239 --> 00:57:57,358
what we're talking about so i wanted to

1781
00:57:56,079 --> 00:57:58,960
highlight a few uh

1782
00:57:57,358 --> 00:58:01,598
that i'm more familiar with so for

1783
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:03,920
example if i was looking at a soil

1784
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:05,760
or a compost the things that i would

1785
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:07,358
want specific to those products would be

1786
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:09,599
i would want a chemical analysis

1787
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:11,440
i would want a biological analysis again

1788
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:13,519
i want to know what inputs they're using

1789
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:17,280
and ingredients in creating this

1790
00:58:13,519 --> 00:58:18,719
product or process and i'd also want a

1791
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:19,200
heavy metal analysis these are all

1792
00:58:18,719 --> 00:58:21,439
things

1793
00:58:19,199 --> 00:58:23,679
that a company should be able to provide

1794
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:24,559
you if you're going to be spending money

1795
00:58:23,679 --> 00:58:26,558
on

1796
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:27,680
the particular product and these are

1797
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:29,200
things that i would want to know

1798
00:58:27,679 --> 00:58:30,719
about anything i'm bringing into my grow

1799
00:58:29,199 --> 00:58:32,159
just like testing your water testing

1800
00:58:30,719 --> 00:58:34,959
your own soil

1801
00:58:32,159 --> 00:58:36,239
don't take a company's word for it if

1802
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:37,519
you can afford i know this isn't

1803
00:58:36,239 --> 00:58:38,798
something everyone can afford to do but

1804
00:58:37,519 --> 00:58:40,318
if you can afford to do these tests

1805
00:58:38,798 --> 00:58:42,719
yourself i think that's really powerful

1806
00:58:40,318 --> 00:58:44,719
to have a third-party analysis of it too

1807
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:46,159
i know i'm always getting tests back

1808
00:58:44,719 --> 00:58:49,039
soil tests back from

1809
00:58:46,159 --> 00:58:50,078
clients uh that they're using our soils

1810
00:58:49,039 --> 00:58:52,079
and so i can compare

1811
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:54,640
those with our tests and then see you

1812
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:56,079
know one what are we putting out there

1813
00:58:54,639 --> 00:58:57,598
and how do these different tests from

1814
00:58:56,079 --> 00:58:58,720
different labs compare to what i think

1815
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:00,880
i'm putting out there

1816
00:58:58,719 --> 00:59:02,558
and also make improvements or see where

1817
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:05,680
something might have gone wrong

1818
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:08,240
it's just it's a good tool to use and

1819
00:59:05,679 --> 00:59:09,519
knowing that chemical analysis which is

1820
00:59:08,239 --> 00:59:11,598
when i say that i'm really talking about

1821
00:59:09,519 --> 00:59:13,280
a soil test or a lab test

1822
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:14,480
uh when we talk about chemicals that

1823
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:15,440
it's just telling us the mineral

1824
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:17,679
nutrient level

1825
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:20,318
is is really important is there anything

1826
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:22,239
you want to add on just compost and soil

1827
00:59:20,318 --> 00:59:24,000
in terms of evaluating them that you

1828
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:27,679
want to touch on

1829
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:30,000
uh no because again it's i mean

1830
00:59:27,679 --> 00:59:32,239
it's just not my area of specialty again

1831
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:34,000
i mean i did take composting in college

1832
00:59:32,239 --> 00:59:35,358
agronomy and you know what's really cool

1833
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:38,400
i actually

1834
00:59:35,358 --> 00:59:40,159
found my one of my agronomy professors

1835
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:41,680
from the university of florida and i

1836
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:42,879
messaged him the other day and he

1837
00:59:41,679 --> 00:59:46,159
remembers me

1838
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:48,720
which is pretty cool dr phil busey um

1839
00:59:46,159 --> 00:59:49,199
down uh in florida so that was kind of

1840
00:59:48,719 --> 00:59:52,399
nice

1841
00:59:49,199 --> 00:59:53,358
um but i mean again i just know enough

1842
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:55,200
to be dangerous

1843
00:59:53,358 --> 00:59:56,719
and i just kind of satellite around and

1844
00:59:55,199 --> 00:59:58,719
you know i don't consult on any of this

1845
00:59:56,719 --> 01:00:00,798
i stick to my six and eight legs but i

1846
00:59:58,719 --> 01:00:03,919
think that the scientific

1847
01:00:00,798 --> 01:00:04,960
idea applies to whatever it is you know

1848
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:06,639
whether it be

1849
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:08,318
pesticides or bugs i mean you just have

1850
01:00:06,639 --> 01:00:11,519
to go through this scientific thing

1851
01:00:08,318 --> 01:00:12,798
and one of the things that my mom always

1852
01:00:11,519 --> 01:00:14,480
said to me and i think this is a whole

1853
01:00:12,798 --> 01:00:15,920
branding thing i need to do in addition

1854
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:17,358
to my tinfoil hat

1855
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:19,200
um i would say something and my mom

1856
01:00:17,358 --> 01:00:21,598
would say put your thinking cap on

1857
01:00:19,199 --> 01:00:22,480
and does that make sense and i think a

1858
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:25,760
lot of times

1859
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:29,199
when somebody makes a claim on a product

1860
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:31,920
stop put your little thinking cap on and

1861
01:00:29,199 --> 01:00:33,279
you know does it really make sense that

1862
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:36,240
this product

1863
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:36,798
you know could do all this but not do

1864
01:00:36,239 --> 01:00:39,118
that

1865
01:00:36,798 --> 01:00:40,719
and if it was so amazing why isn't the

1866
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:42,400
whole world using it

1867
01:00:40,719 --> 01:00:44,480
that's kind of what i you know on these

1868
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:46,559
thought processes with some of the stuff

1869
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:48,159
not to say they can't be good products

1870
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:49,440
but people if they're a good product

1871
01:00:48,159 --> 01:00:51,279
they don't need to overstate their

1872
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:52,639
claims

1873
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:54,000
you know i just had that conversation

1874
01:00:52,639 --> 01:00:55,440
with a grower yesterday because he was

1875
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:58,079
asking me like what do you think about

1876
01:00:55,440 --> 01:01:00,000
these ph adjusted water for pests

1877
01:00:58,079 --> 01:01:02,559
and i know you and i touched on it

1878
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:04,798
briefly but i just my thing was you know

1879
01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:05,599
i haven't tried it but from my

1880
01:01:04,798 --> 01:01:07,679
experience

1881
01:01:05,599 --> 01:01:09,359
i why have i not seen this in greater

1882
01:01:07,679 --> 01:01:10,000
you know agriculture horticulture world

1883
01:01:09,358 --> 01:01:12,960
if this is such

1884
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:14,239
a wonderful cure for all all pests and

1885
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:17,358
diseases

1886
01:01:14,239 --> 01:01:18,719
i mean would would the giant soybean

1887
01:01:17,358 --> 01:01:21,039
farmer rather spend

1888
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:22,318
you know three hundred thousand dollars

1889
01:01:21,039 --> 01:01:25,279
on pesticides

1890
01:01:22,318 --> 01:01:25,920
or adjust his ph of water and spray his

1891
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:29,200
plants

1892
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:30,559
where he doesn't need any licensing

1893
01:01:29,199 --> 01:01:32,000
he doesn't have to buy expensive

1894
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:33,440
pesticides he doesn't have to worry

1895
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,719
about liability of spray drift he

1896
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:36,400
doesn't have to worry about pesticide

1897
01:01:34,719 --> 01:01:40,239
resistance if that worked

1898
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:41,760
why haven't we been doing this for years

1899
01:01:40,239 --> 01:01:44,318
yeah it's not a it's not a perfect

1900
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:46,160
answer i mean one could argue that

1901
01:01:44,318 --> 01:01:47,759
we're just the technology is just now

1902
01:01:46,159 --> 01:01:49,279
catching up with or uh

1903
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:50,960
the the research is catching up with the

1904
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:52,079
technology i guess if i want to say that

1905
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:54,559
in the right order

1906
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:55,839
but in general i think that's a good

1907
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:57,760
just

1908
01:01:55,838 --> 01:02:00,078
a good guide when we're evaluating a

1909
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:00,079
product

1910
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:03,920
touching on another aspect of growing

1911
01:02:03,358 --> 01:02:07,119
though

1912
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:08,400
if we look at biostimulants or microbial

1913
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:09,920
inputs

1914
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:12,240
what sort of things do you look at when

1915
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:14,559
you're looking at those

1916
01:02:12,239 --> 01:02:16,239
with the microbial products the first

1917
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:18,798
thing i always want to know is

1918
01:02:16,239 --> 01:02:19,598
first of all is it alive because we have

1919
01:02:18,798 --> 01:02:21,358
had issues

1920
01:02:19,599 --> 01:02:22,880
with products that are being sold that

1921
01:02:21,358 --> 01:02:26,239
are not viable

1922
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:27,519
uh we're seeing a a bunch of products

1923
01:02:26,239 --> 01:02:29,759
coming to the market right now that

1924
01:02:27,519 --> 01:02:31,838
traditionally have been epa registered

1925
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:32,960
pesticides things like bavaria and

1926
01:02:31,838 --> 01:02:36,400
isaiah

1927
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:39,440
but people are now producing them and

1928
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:42,079
then selling them as bio stimulants so

1929
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:42,798
they can circumvent the epa registration

1930
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:45,039
process

1931
01:02:42,798 --> 01:02:46,480
and what what's interesting i've

1932
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:48,480
actually been looking at some spore

1933
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:50,559
counts uh that actually come from the

1934
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:52,318
companies and it does these these

1935
01:02:50,559 --> 01:02:55,680
inoculum products

1936
01:02:52,318 --> 01:02:57,440
um or you know this i guess inoculum is

1937
01:02:55,679 --> 01:03:00,159
the best way to call them

1938
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:01,280
um they definitely do have lower spore

1939
01:03:00,159 --> 01:03:04,318
numbers in there

1940
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:05,839
but you also have to make sure what

1941
01:03:04,318 --> 01:03:07,279
they're claiming is in there is actually

1942
01:03:05,838 --> 01:03:10,480
in there because we did

1943
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:12,240
get some products from a grower

1944
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:14,559
that had bought one of these non-epa

1945
01:03:12,239 --> 01:03:17,118
registered microbial products

1946
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:18,960
and there are about 15 different

1947
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:21,760
microbial things

1948
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:23,519
in the product after it was plated out

1949
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:24,000
and so ideally there should have just

1950
01:03:23,519 --> 01:03:27,280
been

1951
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:28,960
one thing like if you buy say botanica

1952
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:30,559
wp and you plate it out you're just

1953
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:32,000
going to get a little series of white

1954
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:33,200
fuzz balls and it's all going to look

1955
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:36,159
completely uniform

1956
01:03:33,199 --> 01:03:37,118
and the same with these other products

1957
01:03:36,159 --> 01:03:40,318
and i'm not saying

1958
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:41,838
all soil inoculum or bio i'm not saying

1959
01:03:40,318 --> 01:03:43,759
they're all bad i'm just saying there is

1960
01:03:41,838 --> 01:03:45,759
an issue with some of these products

1961
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:47,599
and so it's very much a buyer beware and

1962
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:48,160
that's why buying epa registered

1963
01:03:47,599 --> 01:03:50,640
products

1964
01:03:48,159 --> 01:03:52,480
that there's a lot of oversight on that

1965
01:03:50,639 --> 01:03:54,078
are regularly checked and tested

1966
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:55,838
and there's companies that have been

1967
01:03:54,079 --> 01:03:56,720
around for decades that are producing

1968
01:03:55,838 --> 01:03:59,358
them so they're good

1969
01:03:56,719 --> 01:03:59,919
solid companies and when you contact

1970
01:03:59,358 --> 01:04:02,480
them

1971
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:03,039
and ask do you have any trial data on

1972
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:05,440
how this

1973
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:07,039
controls that they may not have it for

1974
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:08,400
cannabis but they probably will have a

1975
01:04:07,039 --> 01:04:11,440
lot of good information for

1976
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:14,798
other crops and can provide that kind

1977
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:17,838
of support to you but it is

1978
01:04:14,798 --> 01:04:21,038
it is a very buyer beware be very

1979
01:04:17,838 --> 01:04:24,000
serious aware um because you just don't

1980
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:24,960
know what's in these mystery microbial

1981
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:29,280
products

1982
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:30,000
um yeah it it it's it's scary to me and

1983
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:32,079
to be honest

1984
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,358
i think the epa will catch up with some

1985
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:34,640
of this stuff

1986
01:04:33,358 --> 01:04:37,038
because some of them are making

1987
01:04:34,639 --> 01:04:38,798
pesticidal claims and you cannot

1988
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:41,839
do that on these products because they

1989
01:04:38,798 --> 01:04:44,318
are not epa exempt

1990
01:04:41,838 --> 01:04:45,358
so you're referencing bio pesticides not

1991
01:04:44,318 --> 01:04:48,480
necessarily

1992
01:04:45,358 --> 01:04:50,880
all microbial inputs that are no

1993
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:52,240
making claims around uh you know

1994
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:54,318
increased nutrient cycling

1995
01:04:52,239 --> 01:04:56,479
plant growth yield right you know

1996
01:04:54,318 --> 01:04:56,798
phosphorus solubilization those sorts of

1997
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:59,440
things

1998
01:04:56,798 --> 01:05:01,280
well no not i mean no because again you

1999
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:02,318
know that's my wheelhouse is the six and

2000
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:04,640
eight leg things

2001
01:05:02,318 --> 01:05:05,679
but uh you know with with things like

2002
01:05:04,639 --> 01:05:07,279
trichoderma

2003
01:05:05,679 --> 01:05:09,199
you know which can help with you know

2004
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:11,119
nutrient uptake and disease management

2005
01:05:09,199 --> 01:05:14,239
and stuff too yeah i think that's a

2006
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:16,798
product because i've seen that also sold

2007
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:18,318
um not epa registered and i think it'd

2008
01:05:16,798 --> 01:05:22,000
be very important

2009
01:05:18,318 --> 01:05:24,159
to and it is hard for a grower to

2010
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:26,920
test it you know you can do some quick

2011
01:05:24,159 --> 01:05:29,038
and easy testing in

2012
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:30,000
pre-pre-filled petri dishes that you can

2013
01:05:29,039 --> 01:05:31,520
buy amazon

2014
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,599
but all that's going to tell you is if

2015
01:05:31,519 --> 01:05:35,038
the product's viable but you have to be

2016
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:39,119
very careful because

2017
01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:41,920
not all microbial products will grow

2018
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:43,440
on the the media in these petri dishes i

2019
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:44,480
think mycorrhizae is a really good

2020
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:46,159
example

2021
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:48,079
because you just can't plate up

2022
01:05:46,159 --> 01:05:49,279
mycorrhizae and expect it to grow

2023
01:05:48,079 --> 01:05:52,400
because i

2024
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:54,319
i've i'm i'm

2025
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:56,000
just dangerous enough on mycorrhizae and

2026
01:05:54,318 --> 01:05:57,759
i've been trying to understand it more

2027
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:01,280
and you know i did ask several of the

2028
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:04,559
companies how do you test for viability

2029
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:06,240
because there's concerns on are

2030
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:08,160
are the products actually alive when you

2031
01:06:06,239 --> 01:06:10,639
get them and it was amazing to me how

2032
01:06:08,159 --> 01:06:13,118
many people couldn't answer

2033
01:06:10,639 --> 01:06:15,118
from my from mycorrhizae companies how

2034
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:16,640
you actually test mycorrhizae to see if

2035
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:18,400
it's alive and that's kind of a little

2036
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:20,000
bit of a red flag for me and i'm not

2037
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:22,960
saying all products are bad

2038
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,920
but i just think that you know if you

2039
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:25,838
look at products

2040
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:28,318
that have a long track record that are

2041
01:06:25,838 --> 01:06:30,400
being used across multiple industries

2042
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:32,079
that might be a little better than

2043
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:35,599
something that's a smaller company

2044
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:38,559
that's just been cannabis focused

2045
01:06:35,599 --> 01:06:40,720
yeah i think microbial inputs are tricky

2046
01:06:38,559 --> 01:06:41,760
for sure so you mentioned viability

2047
01:06:40,719 --> 01:06:44,798
you know how do we know that they're

2048
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:47,359
even viable how do we know that

2049
01:06:44,798 --> 01:06:48,880
what's in the bag matches what's on the

2050
01:06:47,358 --> 01:06:50,480
label because technically to make it on

2051
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:51,519
that label they just have to provide one

2052
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:53,280
test

2053
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:55,679
that shows those levels guarant as a

2054
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:58,640
guaranteed analysis from a lab

2055
01:06:55,679 --> 01:07:00,639
to whatever the registration registering

2056
01:06:58,639 --> 01:07:01,118
agency is whether it's but that people

2057
01:07:00,639 --> 01:07:03,118
aren't even

2058
01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:04,559
ready but the stuff isn't even

2059
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:06,880
registered this stuff

2060
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:07,760
that we picked up for the one grower

2061
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:09,519
they bought it

2062
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:11,359
at a trade show like from under the

2063
01:07:09,519 --> 01:07:12,719
table and it didn't even have there was

2064
01:07:11,358 --> 01:07:15,440
no epa register there was

2065
01:07:12,719 --> 01:07:18,879
nothing on it just here here's the rate

2066
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:21,838
and a date and that was it

2067
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:22,960
well i wouldn't buy that but but the

2068
01:07:21,838 --> 01:07:25,838
problem you know

2069
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:26,318
is a grower didn't understand that this

2070
01:07:25,838 --> 01:07:29,599
was

2071
01:07:26,318 --> 01:07:32,318
a problem you know that's

2072
01:07:29,599 --> 01:07:33,920
that's until you realize this they

2073
01:07:32,318 --> 01:07:35,519
thought that was fine to use and they

2074
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:37,599
don't understand

2075
01:07:35,519 --> 01:07:38,880
the risk involved with doing stuff like

2076
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:42,240
that and

2077
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:45,200
and it's just coming from i

2078
01:07:42,239 --> 01:07:45,759
you know not understanding regulatory

2079
01:07:45,199 --> 01:07:49,038
stuff

2080
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:51,119
and and risk is you know

2081
01:07:49,039 --> 01:07:52,640
it's not the grower's fault um they're

2082
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:54,559
trying to do the right thing

2083
01:07:52,639 --> 01:07:58,480
um but it's just it's a really tough

2084
01:07:54,559 --> 01:08:00,798
situation right now with all of that

2085
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:01,920
well we are seeing some testing coming

2086
01:08:00,798 --> 01:08:03,280
out of the oregon department of

2087
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:05,039
agriculture they've been doing it for a

2088
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:06,160
number of years now and they share that

2089
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:08,160
testing now

2090
01:08:06,159 --> 01:08:10,078
whether or not all the manufacturers

2091
01:08:08,159 --> 01:08:10,960
agree with that testing is a whole

2092
01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:13,519
another

2093
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:15,519
uh a whole another podcast altogether

2094
01:08:13,519 --> 01:08:17,039
but there is some testing available so

2095
01:08:15,519 --> 01:08:19,359
you can go on their website

2096
01:08:17,039 --> 01:08:21,039
and and see what results they got and

2097
01:08:19,359 --> 01:08:21,920
some products test quite well other

2098
01:08:21,039 --> 01:08:23,920
products test

2099
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:25,759
quite differently than what they are

2100
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:28,960
purportedly on the label

2101
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:30,640
itself but when we're looking at these

2102
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:32,798
microbial products

2103
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:34,560
i think we have at least for me if i was

2104
01:08:32,798 --> 01:08:36,719
going to trial one

2105
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:38,640
what i would do or what we've done in

2106
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:39,920
facilities is look at okay we're going

2107
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:42,079
to apply

2108
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:42,960
this particular microbial product just

2109
01:08:42,079 --> 01:08:45,920
to

2110
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:46,880
the these beds here or these plants and

2111
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:48,560
see

2112
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:50,400
and keep those plants separate out so

2113
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:53,039
that when we go to we go to harvest we

2114
01:08:50,399 --> 01:08:55,039
can see if our yield increased

2115
01:08:53,039 --> 01:08:56,798
overall and if we can say that you know

2116
01:08:55,039 --> 01:08:59,920
product x microbial product

2117
01:08:56,798 --> 01:09:00,719
increased our yield in this facility by

2118
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:02,000
10

2119
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:04,158
then it would be worth applying because

2120
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:05,679
it's you know a high value crop

2121
01:09:04,158 --> 01:09:07,599
it would be worth using that product now

2122
01:09:05,679 --> 01:09:09,039
do we know what the mechanism action was

2123
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:12,159
do we know that every bottle is

2124
01:09:09,039 --> 01:09:13,838
is viable uh the answer would be no to

2125
01:09:12,158 --> 01:09:14,318
all of that but we can we can at least

2126
01:09:13,838 --> 01:09:16,960
apply

2127
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:18,080
some level of control or or testing or

2128
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:20,319
trial

2129
01:09:18,079 --> 01:09:22,479
before just applying a product you know

2130
01:09:20,319 --> 01:09:24,640
willy-nilly across an entire

2131
01:09:22,479 --> 01:09:25,919
entire grow i guess i agree with you a

2132
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:28,480
hundred percent

2133
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:29,600
the only thing that i'm kind of curious

2134
01:09:28,479 --> 01:09:31,519
about i noticed

2135
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:33,440
because so and i'm not picking on

2136
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:35,920
medicine but i'm not meditating

2137
01:09:33,439 --> 01:09:37,039
i'm sorry um mycorrhizae you know there

2138
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:39,279
was a big push

2139
01:09:37,039 --> 01:09:41,600
into the ornamental greenhouse about 10

2140
01:09:39,279 --> 01:09:43,040
12 years ago for michael ryzey

2141
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:45,120
you know for you know to use it on

2142
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:47,198
everything and all the growers jumped in

2143
01:09:45,119 --> 01:09:48,798
but you know my question is if the

2144
01:09:47,198 --> 01:09:51,119
mycorrhizae is so good

2145
01:09:48,798 --> 01:09:52,798
why do you have other things like

2146
01:09:51,119 --> 01:09:53,519
cytokinins and then they're mixed in

2147
01:09:52,798 --> 01:09:56,399
with the product

2148
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:58,159
and how do you know what is actually

2149
01:09:56,399 --> 01:10:00,799
providing the benefit to the plant

2150
01:09:58,158 --> 01:10:02,158
so i get a little leery if there's too

2151
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:04,880
many things in the product

2152
01:10:02,158 --> 01:10:05,920
i mean if it's you know it should be

2153
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:08,480
able to just

2154
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:10,079
be the the product you need and not the

2155
01:10:08,479 --> 01:10:10,639
other things around it because i i

2156
01:10:10,079 --> 01:10:12,719
wonder

2157
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:14,560
sometimes with those tests if it was a

2158
01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:15,119
cytokines given that little push in the

2159
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:17,679
plant

2160
01:10:15,119 --> 01:10:18,960
because the more i'm understanding about

2161
01:10:17,679 --> 01:10:21,199
how long it takes for

2162
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:23,279
you know mycorrhizae to really establish

2163
01:10:21,198 --> 01:10:25,359
if you've got the right species

2164
01:10:23,279 --> 01:10:27,920
and all that you know the ornamental

2165
01:10:25,359 --> 01:10:29,599
crops have too fast of a turnaround time

2166
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:31,119
you know because the ornamental crops

2167
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:33,760
are usually you know out

2168
01:10:31,119 --> 01:10:35,198
real fast and so you know that's what

2169
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:36,960
makes me think it was actually maybe the

2170
01:10:35,198 --> 01:10:38,719
cytokinins doing the work and not

2171
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:42,079
necessarily the mycorrhizae having time

2172
01:10:38,719 --> 01:10:42,079
to get established in the crop

2173
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:46,239
yeah and i wanna i wanna come back to

2174
01:10:44,719 --> 01:10:48,880
mycorrhizae but one thing before

2175
01:10:46,238 --> 01:10:50,158
uh or mycorrhizal fungus but before i do

2176
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:52,239
the one thing i wanna mention too is

2177
01:10:50,158 --> 01:10:53,920
also microbial persistence

2178
01:10:52,238 --> 01:10:56,000
and this idea is like how long are these

2179
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:57,440
microbes staying alive in the soil after

2180
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,560
we apply them do we have to apply them

2181
01:10:57,439 --> 01:11:00,079
every two weeks

2182
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:01,840
do we apply them once and never have to

2183
01:11:00,079 --> 01:11:05,198
worry about again now when we talk about

2184
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:05,600
mycorrhizal fungus and it's interesting

2185
01:11:05,198 --> 01:11:06,799
because

2186
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:08,400
mycorrhizae is actually that

2187
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:10,320
relationship between the fungus and the

2188
01:11:08,399 --> 01:11:13,359
root so there's a little bit of a

2189
01:11:10,319 --> 01:11:15,119
nomenclature distinction here but um

2190
01:11:13,359 --> 01:11:16,719
and i know justin i know just a little

2191
01:11:15,119 --> 01:11:17,920
bit more to be slightly more dangerous

2192
01:11:16,719 --> 01:11:19,520
than you on this

2193
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:21,199
but uh when we talk you mentioned

2194
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:22,800
species and we talk about that well

2195
01:11:21,198 --> 01:11:24,000
there's products out there that you you

2196
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:24,880
go to read the label you know you're

2197
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,238
trying to do the right thing and you

2198
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:28,079
read it and you're like oh my gosh this

2199
01:11:26,238 --> 01:11:31,439
has 1.2 million

2200
01:11:28,079 --> 01:11:32,158
spores of uh you know mycorrhizal spores

2201
01:11:31,439 --> 01:11:33,279
in there

2202
01:11:32,158 --> 01:11:34,799
and but then when you look a little

2203
01:11:33,279 --> 01:11:36,639
closer you see that they're you know for

2204
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:38,279
example if we're growing cannabis

2205
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:40,320
and they have high levels of

2206
01:11:38,279 --> 01:11:41,840
ectomycorrhizal spores well

2207
01:11:40,319 --> 01:11:44,000
that forms a relationship with conifers

2208
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:45,520
that's not going to do us any good

2209
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:48,158
in terms of getting mycorrhizal

2210
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:50,239
infection of our cannabis plant

2211
01:11:48,158 --> 01:11:52,399
so you know if i'm if i'm looking

2212
01:11:50,238 --> 01:11:55,678
growing you know blueberries or

2213
01:11:52,399 --> 01:11:57,039
azaleas or tomatoes those

2214
01:11:55,679 --> 01:11:59,039
those are going to be very different

2215
01:11:57,039 --> 01:12:00,719
mycorrhizal relationships and so i have

2216
01:11:59,039 --> 01:12:03,039
to make sure i'm getting the right

2217
01:12:00,719 --> 01:12:04,319
uh you know mycorrhizal species and then

2218
01:12:03,039 --> 01:12:06,000
just to complicate things they keep

2219
01:12:04,319 --> 01:12:08,479
changing names so you'll have

2220
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:10,079
glomus enteratises which is now you know

2221
01:12:08,479 --> 01:12:12,479
uh glomus irregularis

2222
01:12:10,079 --> 01:12:14,000
which got changed out of the glomus

2223
01:12:12,479 --> 01:12:17,439
family altogether so it became

2224
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:18,960
uh i believe rhizophagus irregularis so

2225
01:12:17,439 --> 01:12:20,079
it just gets really really confusing

2226
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:22,000
because you could find any of those

2227
01:12:20,079 --> 01:12:25,359
names on a particular label

2228
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:28,800
it's all the same species essentially of

2229
01:12:25,359 --> 01:12:30,319
a fungus now one other thing to consider

2230
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:32,079
there when we're talking about this is

2231
01:12:30,319 --> 01:12:32,880
you mentioned multiple products in there

2232
01:12:32,079 --> 01:12:35,119
so you'll see

2233
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:36,000
let's say that product had you know 1.2

2234
01:12:35,119 --> 01:12:37,760
million spores

2235
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,679
of ectomycorrhizal fungus well it may

2236
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:43,199
have a hundred spores

2237
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:45,119
per cc of you know the right glomus

2238
01:12:43,198 --> 01:12:45,759
endomycorrhizal species for the plant

2239
01:12:45,119 --> 01:12:47,840
that we're going

2240
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:49,199
in this case cannabis but then it may

2241
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:52,319
have

2242
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:52,799
three million spores of trichoderma in

2243
01:12:52,319 --> 01:12:55,119
there

2244
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:57,360
and like you mentioned well shoot when

2245
01:12:55,119 --> 01:13:00,559
we have that much of a difference

2246
01:12:57,359 --> 01:13:01,679
in uh the amount of spores in a product

2247
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:03,440
how do we know that it isn't the

2248
01:13:01,679 --> 01:13:05,679
trichoderma that's making a difference

2249
01:13:03,439 --> 01:13:07,439
trichoderma is you know cheap relative

2250
01:13:05,679 --> 01:13:10,239
to mycorrhizal fungus

2251
01:13:07,439 --> 01:13:10,719
uh why are we spending all this money at

2252
01:13:10,238 --> 01:13:12,079
the

2253
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:14,319
at the very least we're spending too

2254
01:13:12,079 --> 01:13:15,600
much money or we're you know

2255
01:13:14,319 --> 01:13:17,039
we're applying the product wrong you

2256
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:18,880
know if we just apply the product over

2257
01:13:17,039 --> 01:13:20,560
the top and it's not coming in direct

2258
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:21,119
contact with the roots now we're wasting

2259
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:23,600
our money

2260
01:13:21,119 --> 01:13:24,238
as well so there's just so many of these

2261
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:25,600
variables

2262
01:13:24,238 --> 01:13:27,198
that like you mentioned that are that

2263
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:28,640
are really important with microbials

2264
01:13:27,198 --> 01:13:29,119
that i think we have to we have to

2265
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:31,840
really

2266
01:13:29,119 --> 01:13:32,479
consider right yeah and again this is

2267
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:34,880
something

2268
01:13:32,479 --> 01:13:36,559
that in the reality we know nothing

2269
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:38,319
about really what's happening not for

2270
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:38,960
hundreds of years will we understand

2271
01:13:38,319 --> 01:13:42,079
more

2272
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:43,279
but there is some initial work going on

2273
01:13:42,079 --> 01:13:45,519
right now looking at some of the

2274
01:13:43,279 --> 01:13:47,279
bacillus's and trichodermas

2275
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:49,280
and how they perform differently in

2276
01:13:47,279 --> 01:13:52,719
different media types

2277
01:13:49,279 --> 01:13:56,000
because basically they do the

2278
01:13:52,719 --> 01:13:56,800
they they perform different different

2279
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,880
medias to

2280
01:13:56,800 --> 01:14:00,000
to leave it at that and that's why again

2281
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:03,119
why you may

2282
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,679
see a researcher do a project you do a

2283
01:14:03,119 --> 01:14:05,439
trial

2284
01:14:03,679 --> 01:14:07,039
with a product and get great results and

2285
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:09,198
then you don't see that

2286
01:14:07,039 --> 01:14:10,880
out in your facility it could have to do

2287
01:14:09,198 --> 01:14:12,238
your soil types are different enough

2288
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:15,359
that the microbials

2289
01:14:12,238 --> 01:14:16,959
are acting different and by the way

2290
01:14:15,359 --> 01:14:19,198
while we were sitting here

2291
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:21,679
i googled real quick you know plants

2292
01:14:19,198 --> 01:14:25,039
with non-mycorrhizal associations

2293
01:14:21,679 --> 01:14:28,719
apparently 29 of all vascular

2294
01:14:25,039 --> 01:14:29,279
plants are non-hosts for mycorrhizae so

2295
01:14:28,719 --> 01:14:32,480
30

2296
01:14:29,279 --> 01:14:33,759
of plants aren't hosts i

2297
01:14:32,479 --> 01:14:36,319
thought it had been a lot lower than

2298
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:38,560
that i thought it was like

2299
01:14:36,319 --> 01:14:40,960
90 some percent of plants had some some

2300
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:43,120
level of mycorrhizal relationship

2301
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:44,000
notably for those of us that grow

2302
01:14:43,119 --> 01:14:47,599
vegetables

2303
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:49,679
anything in the brassica family uh is uh

2304
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:50,880
non-mycorrhizal so we don't want to be

2305
01:14:49,679 --> 01:14:53,760
applying

2306
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:55,279
it to our kale or our broccoli for those

2307
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:57,520
of us that are using mycorrhizae in our

2308
01:14:55,279 --> 01:14:58,719
garden yeah well and you know from

2309
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:01,120
when you say garden do you mean like

2310
01:14:58,719 --> 01:15:03,198
vegetable garden or garden garden yeah

2311
01:15:01,119 --> 01:15:04,880
sorry vegetable garden when i say garden

2312
01:15:03,198 --> 01:15:06,079
and you know i do massive tons of

2313
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:08,239
vegetable gardening here

2314
01:15:06,079 --> 01:15:10,238
but you know what it's pennsylvania you

2315
01:15:08,238 --> 01:15:12,639
look at the soil and it grows here

2316
01:15:10,238 --> 01:15:14,238
so i don't do and i mean in my seedlings

2317
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:16,079
i add trichoderma just to you know

2318
01:15:14,238 --> 01:15:18,479
prevent a little damping off

2319
01:15:16,079 --> 01:15:19,519
but other than that i mean my soil is so

2320
01:15:18,479 --> 01:15:21,599
rich here i mean

2321
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:22,800
tomatoes volunteer each year from the

2322
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:25,520
previous year

2323
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:26,960
it's uh it's pretty nuts and then yet

2324
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:29,120
and you know getting those 11 inches of

2325
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:30,960
rain in 48 hours you know

2326
01:15:29,119 --> 01:15:33,198
we're good on water for a while now over

2327
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:33,198
here

2328
01:15:33,279 --> 01:15:36,479
that's great that's great well i

2329
01:15:35,119 --> 01:15:39,760
appreciate your time today

2330
01:15:36,479 --> 01:15:42,238
and uh talking about this topic i just

2331
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:45,760
i just want to caution listeners you

2332
01:15:42,238 --> 01:15:47,599
know when considering whatever product

2333
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:49,039
that they may be using in their garden

2334
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:51,520
make sure that they're doing

2335
01:15:49,039 --> 01:15:53,359
this sort of thought process or level of

2336
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:56,320
evaluation because at the very

2337
01:15:53,359 --> 01:15:57,679
at the very very least um they could

2338
01:15:56,319 --> 01:16:00,079
probably save some money

2339
01:15:57,679 --> 01:16:01,279
even if the product itself works there

2340
01:16:00,079 --> 01:16:04,479
may be more

2341
01:16:01,279 --> 01:16:05,599
effective ways to get the same result uh

2342
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:08,319
using something that might be more

2343
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:10,000
affordable um or using less of a product

2344
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:11,679
so you can always be testing things to

2345
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:13,520
improve your process i guess

2346
01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:15,039
right and and i mean i agree with

2347
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:16,400
everything you've been saying tad that's

2348
01:16:15,039 --> 01:16:20,000
why i like you so much

2349
01:16:16,399 --> 01:16:22,719
um and i i just i you can't i mean yes

2350
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:24,880
there's a lot to be said for talking to

2351
01:16:22,719 --> 01:16:26,960
other people that have done other stuff

2352
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:28,239
um and i guess word of mouth is a

2353
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:29,760
starting point

2354
01:16:28,238 --> 01:16:31,359
but i think it's always good to check

2355
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:34,480
the products from yourself and and do

2356
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:36,799
your homework on your products and um

2357
01:16:34,479 --> 01:16:37,519
you know i i had a grower comment back

2358
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:39,920
to me

2359
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:42,080
that you know well they're too busy to

2360
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:42,560
to check on details and facts on these

2361
01:16:42,079 --> 01:16:45,359
things

2362
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:47,199
and i'm like how can you not be because

2363
01:16:45,359 --> 01:16:49,198
i mean this is your livelihood

2364
01:16:47,198 --> 01:16:51,039
or if you're just doing this as a hobby

2365
01:16:49,198 --> 01:16:53,198
is it something you're ingesting i mean

2366
01:16:51,039 --> 01:16:55,840
do your homework and make sure

2367
01:16:53,198 --> 01:16:56,319
that what you're doing is you know safe

2368
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:57,920
for you

2369
01:16:56,319 --> 01:17:00,479
safe for the environment and you're not

2370
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:02,319
wasting money i mean that's the

2371
01:17:00,479 --> 01:17:03,759
you know the one of the big things there

2372
01:17:02,319 --> 01:17:06,639
i do see a lot of money

2373
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:08,159
spent that's not needed i i do fully

2374
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:10,719
believe in microbial stuff i

2375
01:17:08,158 --> 01:17:12,319
i think with pest management we're going

2376
01:17:10,719 --> 01:17:14,000
to see a lot more microbial pest

2377
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:16,479
management products coming

2378
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:18,079
um i mean i already am pretty excited

2379
01:17:16,479 --> 01:17:20,399
that we have you know

2380
01:17:18,079 --> 01:17:23,119
several registered strains of a very

2381
01:17:20,399 --> 01:17:25,759
basiana here in the united states to use

2382
01:17:23,119 --> 01:17:27,439
and so again the big guys are getting

2383
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:29,199
more involved with microbials and so

2384
01:17:27,439 --> 01:17:31,119
they can afford more research so we'll

2385
01:17:29,198 --> 01:17:33,279
we'll get more information on it

2386
01:17:31,119 --> 01:17:34,479
uh just be smart and you know again

2387
01:17:33,279 --> 01:17:38,158
we're in your thinking cap

2388
01:17:34,479 --> 01:17:38,158
my mom will be proud of you if you do

2389
01:17:38,319 --> 01:17:42,319
thanks suzanne and oh man i want to sign

2390
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:43,520
off there but i really have to ask you

2391
01:17:42,319 --> 01:17:46,319
this question

2392
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:47,280
with microbials are you seeing

2393
01:17:46,319 --> 01:17:49,840
resistance

2394
01:17:47,279 --> 01:17:51,119
from uh insects like you might with

2395
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:53,440
traditional chemistries

2396
01:17:51,119 --> 01:17:54,158
or is that not a problem the same with

2397
01:17:53,439 --> 01:17:56,960
other like

2398
01:17:54,158 --> 01:17:57,359
you know predatory insects so when i

2399
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:59,760
went

2400
01:17:57,359 --> 01:18:02,399
and i took that insect pathology course

2401
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:04,400
at cornell and it was taught by the top

2402
01:18:02,399 --> 01:18:06,238
insect pathologists in the world it was

2403
01:18:04,399 --> 01:18:08,479
amazing i mean i was fangirling the

2404
01:18:06,238 --> 01:18:10,718
whole time about these researchers

2405
01:18:08,479 --> 01:18:12,158
i asked that exact question and they

2406
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:15,600
said they have never

2407
01:18:12,158 --> 01:18:18,319
seen it is it possible yes

2408
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:19,360
anything's impossible i mean anything's

2409
01:18:18,319 --> 01:18:22,479
possible

2410
01:18:19,359 --> 01:18:24,799
but um it is not something we're worried

2411
01:18:22,479 --> 01:18:26,639
about i have an ornamental greenhouse

2412
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:28,640
that we rely heavily on bio control and

2413
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:29,920
we fog in a cold fogger

2414
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:31,440
which by the way i've recently learned

2415
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:32,239
cannabis growers don't know what cold

2416
01:18:31,439 --> 01:18:35,119
foggers are

2417
01:18:32,238 --> 01:18:36,399
so you know go google cold foggers

2418
01:18:35,119 --> 01:18:38,079
people and learn about them

2419
01:18:36,399 --> 01:18:40,238
ornamental growers use them all the time

2420
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:41,760
but they cold fog bavaria

2421
01:18:40,238 --> 01:18:43,279
once a week and they've been doing it

2422
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:46,400
for years and we have not had any

2423
01:18:43,279 --> 01:18:48,079
resistance issues with it

2424
01:18:46,399 --> 01:18:49,839
cool all right well we'll end on that

2425
01:18:48,079 --> 01:18:51,279
note because uh i think that's a really

2426
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:51,679
interesting point that i wasn't aware of

2427
01:18:51,279 --> 01:18:54,319
either

2428
01:18:51,679 --> 01:18:55,440
so thank you for your time today suzanne
