00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:20,719
welcome to the cannabis cultivation and

3
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,640
science podcast

4
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:24,879
i'm your host tadd hussey of kiss

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,719
organics this is the podcast where we

6
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:28,239
discuss the cutting edge of growing from

7
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:30,079
a science-based perspective

8
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:31,518
and drawn top experts from around the

9
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:32,479
industry to share their wisdom and

10
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:34,320
knowledge

11
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:36,159
now to date i've had few guests on the

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,520
show that grow using mineral salts or

13
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:39,359
chemical fertilizers

14
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,359
the majority of my guests using organic

15
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:42,719
production mainly because i'm big on

16
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:44,558
organics and that's the side of the

17
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,160
industry i'm most familiar with

18
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:48,079
however there is a lot of science in

19
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:50,319
recent years coming from universities

20
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,239
and researchers using chemical nutrients

21
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,759
and i think as a science-based podcast

22
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:55,038
we need to cover all aspects of

23
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:56,479
cultivation

24
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,320
not only is there a lot to learn from

25
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:59,358
our fellow cultivators regardless of

26
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,039
methodology

27
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,960
but i realize that chemical nutrients

28
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,960
are here to stay and there are pros and

29
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,239
cons to using chemical nutrients as well

30
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:08,478
as organics

31
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:09,920
now if we can grow more sustainably or

32
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:10,959
use more environmentally friendly

33
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,439
methods that reduce

34
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:15,118
salts in our runoff then i'm all for it

35
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:16,478
using nutrients that have a smaller

36
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:19,040
fossil fuel footprint

37
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:20,879
reduce runoff contain less heavy metals

38
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,439
and allow us to maximize plant health

39
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:22,879
and growth

40
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:24,239
is important on both sides of the

41
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:26,560
industry and this is something we

42
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:28,798
discussed today in greater depth

43
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,118
my guest this week is carrie peters she

44
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,240
is the vice president at j.r peters and

45
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:33,759
the formulator of all

46
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:35,280
products and development of new

47
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,280
fertilizer formulas

48
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,200
that provide crop specific solutions to

49
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,960
growers nutritional issues

50
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,478
she has too many honors and accolades to

51
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:43,919
list here but i will put them up on the

52
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:46,640
podcast page

53
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,399
carrie has a phd in plant sciences and a

54
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,680
masters of science in agronomy from the

55
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,118
university of maryland

56
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,840
as well as a bachelor's of science in

57
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:55,438
biology she's the third generation of

be here thank you yeah let's start off

67
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:18,399
by giving listeners a little

68
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,560
bit of your background so they know who

69
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:24,080
they're listening to today

70
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:26,878
yeah well i'm dr carrie peters and

71
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,959
i guess my title that they're trying to

72
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:31,679
be a little more fun and cool instead of

73
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,959
chemist i'm the master crafter and

74
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,159
formulator of

75
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:38,319
jax fertilizer and we make

76
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:40,159
fertilizers for a whole bunch of

77
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:41,919
different things all over the world

78
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:43,519
here and we're based in allentown

79
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:46,799
pennsylvania

80
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:50,239
so yeah i'm the formulator for this crew

81
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:53,040
here now you spent some time

82
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,439
in in school studying this sort of thing

83
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:54,878
right

84
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:56,959
can you touch a little bit on your

85
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:59,199
academic background

86
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,158
yeah for sure i mean the cool thing

87
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:02,479
about

88
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:04,239
being in a family business is and that's

89
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:05,439
what we have here jax is a family

90
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,319
business we've been

91
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:09,598
that was founded in 1947. you kind of

92
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:11,598
grow up

93
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:12,719
just thinking that everybody knows

94
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:14,959
things about

95
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:15,919
plants and and plant nutrients and the

96
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,080
science behind it

97
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:19,039
but turns out you know what you hear

98
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,000
from your grandparents

99
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:24,158
isn't always you know fact-based so i

100
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,878
went to school i actually was a biology

101
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:28,239
major

102
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:29,039
in uh for my undergrad and a chemistry

103
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,680
background

104
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:32,239
and then for my master's i got my

105
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,360
master's

106
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:38,239
in agronomy with the usda and i

107
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,440
worked with plants that accumulated

108
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,480
heavy metals

109
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:45,519
that was really cool you know all over

110
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:46,000
this usda kind of project was all over

111
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,080
the world

112
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,919
and plants that hyper accumulate nickel

113
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,159
and cadmium and zinc

114
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:53,759
and then to kind of bring it back to

115
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:55,039
things i needed to know to join my

116
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:58,399
family company

117
00:03:55,039 --> 00:04:00,000
my phd is in plant nutrition from the

118
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,480
university of maryland

119
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,519
and i spent a lot of time with geraniums

120
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:04,878
geraniums

121
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,280
even though they annoy a lot of people

122
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:09,438
are my favorite crop and i looked at

123
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,199
nutrient uptake under different

124
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:14,560
conditions so

125
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:16,000
yeah i did you know finally get out of

126
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,600
school and was able to bring that

127
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,798
knowledge back to my

128
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,879
uh family company in 2004

129
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:24,478
and i've been with them ever since kind

130
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:27,360
of crafting and

131
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:28,560
and bringing my kind of i don't know my

132
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,360
my little

133
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:34,959
influence into how we build um

134
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,479
fertilizers under the jack's name

135
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:38,239
so you definitely have the background to

136
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:40,240
bring science to the table uh when it

137
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,160
comes to these formulations and i

138
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,000
i want to start off talking a little bit

139
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,479
about

140
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,600
about your companies but i do want to

141
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:49,359
touch on

142
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,320
the heavy metal stuff i want to touch on

143
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,479
water and some of these other aspects

144
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:56,159
but let's start off just talking about

145
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:56,719
because this is a little bit out there

146
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,479
for

147
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,560
me in the sense that i'm i'm an organic

148
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:02,159
guy i don't have any experience growing

149
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,560
with mineral salts or chemical

150
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,160
fertilizers uh and your company that's

151
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,879
sort of your world

152
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,360
let's let me talk a little bit about

153
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:12,240
some

154
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,720
of the uh you know sustainably

155
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,918
sustainability aspects of

156
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:20,479
uh mineral salts or chemical fertilizers

157
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:21,839
yeah for sure i mean it is so

158
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:24,478
interesting because

159
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:27,519
um you know our my whole family are

160
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:29,360
right like grew up in this mineral world

161
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:31,120
and actually in allentown pennsylvania

162
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,520
in our little town here

163
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,240
there is the company called bro dale who

164
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:36,399
did

165
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,000
runner's world and organic magazine and

166
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:40,239
they they lived right across

167
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,279
the street from my grandfather so they

168
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,639
always used to have

169
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:46,319
these like really cool discussions about

170
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,319
you know the beginning of the organic

171
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:49,680
movement and this was in the like 60s

172
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:51,599
and 70s

173
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,199
to you know how my grandfather was

174
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,560
moving forward so

175
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,360
it's kind of neat um but yeah we we are

176
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,519
a company that

177
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,000
truly the majority of what we do is we

178
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:04,719
blend water-soluble powders

179
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
and in different you know ratios and

180
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,440
concentrations in order

181
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,720
to deliver these really soluble

182
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:15,279
and available nutrients to the plant

183
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,160
we make for our product that's under the

184
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:17,679
name of jax

185
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,759
you'll see jack's professional and

186
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,079
horticulture

187
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,038
and also like specialty ag all over the

188
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:25,839
world

189
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:26,560
and then jack's nutrients goes into

190
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:29,198
cannabis

191
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,240
and hemp and then the jack's classic

192
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:33,360
line is like for

193
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,120
home gardeners we we don't sell to um

194
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,960
like home depot and walmart and stuff

195
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,439
like that but we it's

196
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:41,680
independent garden centers and kind of

197
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:42,319
mom-and-pop main street america things

198
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,038
but

199
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,560
it's all these really quality and

200
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:49,279
qualified

201
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,160
raw materials that are these nutrient

202
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:53,198
salts

203
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,960
that we take them from like

204
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,240
you know it's a global market right

205
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:58,478
you're getting them from all over the

206
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,360
world and we qualify them for low heavy

207
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:04,399
metals and the purity and solubility

208
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,800
that we find is our standard at jacks

209
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:07,679
and that's how we go about putting

210
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,360
together

211
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,280
the products that we have out there

212
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:15,840
under our name so

213
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:17,198
does that make sense it does so

214
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:18,638
i'm trying to think how to approach this

215
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,240
here i want i want to kind of have a

216
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,680
little bit of a debate a friendly debate

217
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,038
that is on some of the

218
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:28,879
pros and cons of organics versus

219
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:30,478
um you know chemical fertilizers and

220
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:32,399
you know there's there are definite pros

221
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:34,159
and cons on both sides so

222
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:35,359
i'm gonna list a few and you know tell

223
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,639
me what i miss here but i'm just

224
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,280
thinking off top my head

225
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,879
uh some of the the cons with mineral

226
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:44,000
salts are

227
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:45,519
risk of over application and leaching

228
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,000
into our groundwater

229
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:52,799
um cost in terms of manufacturing

230
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,560
and and freighting and stuff to get some

231
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:58,000
of these mineral salts

232
00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:01,519
processed and produced and into you know

233
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,598
to your location um

234
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:05,680
those are the two major ones i think of

235
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:08,159
um

236
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,560
in terms of benefits you have the

237
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,800
ability to really craft something

238
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,800
exactly the way you want it and in terms

239
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,800
of consistency

240
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,160
and ability to replicate something i

241
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,240
think you have a lot more control than

242
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,240
we do in organics

243
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,280
what are some of the other pros and cons

244
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,319
around there

245
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:29,519
at least on the on the mineral salt side

246
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:32,240
yeah we do get this

247
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:33,120
quite a bit because like you said before

248
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,959
my world is

249
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:40,479
100 this mineral side of it but um

250
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:42,319
you know when we look at when you look

251
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:45,680
at delivering nutrients

252
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,920
to a plant a lot and and we we have a

253
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:48,239
laboratory on site here that we do a lot

254
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:51,360
of

255
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,519
um testing of all different crops and

256
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,759
and honestly we never really ask like

257
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,440
what nutrients are you using like we're

258
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:58,240
not going to test it if you're not using

259
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,720
jax

260
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,320
but what that does is gives a a real

261
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,320
insight on

262
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,399
the nutrient targets or nutrient

263
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,640
requirements that different crops

264
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,799
grown and all these these different

265
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:14,240
environmental conditions

266
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:17,759
um kind of require and like you said the

267
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:19,839
the i i think in my opinion the biggest

268
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:23,278
benefit is being able to hit

269
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:26,320
nutrient targets exactly with mineral

270
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:29,278
raw materials so we're able to

271
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,160
you know say we would like a formula to

272
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:32,720
deliver

273
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:34,399
you know 40 percent of its nitrogen from

274
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:39,200
a nitrate base

275
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:40,799
and we can exactly match that um

276
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,720
there's there's a difference when you

277
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:45,919
talk about cons like

278
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,879
what you're saying is so true that some

279
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:50,159
of the mineral

280
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:52,320
sources out there that are you know

281
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:53,199
chemical fertilizers are horrible

282
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,879
quality

283
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,879
like you're getting them from sources

284
00:09:54,879 --> 00:10:00,320
you don't know where they're coming from

285
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:01,838
they have you know not so great things

286
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,040
in there as by-products or

287
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:07,200
others um the most obvious that everyone

288
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:11,519
worries about is heavy metals of course

289
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:13,440
arsenic lead lead cadmium um

290
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,679
you know all all of those types of

291
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,680
things but there's also just

292
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:19,759
you know other byproducts that really

293
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:22,639
the plant doesn't need

294
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:23,519
and when you apply them at the wrong

295
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:25,919
rate

296
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,039
they do kind of take up the spaces in

297
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:30,399
the root zone

298
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:32,000
the large and small pore spaces and it

299
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:35,039
doesn't allow for great root

300
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
growth and you know it can and lead to

301
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:39,759
all this buildup

302
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,720
in there um so overall you run into that

303
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:43,439
quite a bit with

304
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,959
with choosing mineral fertilizers like

305
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,200
when we talk about jacks

306
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:49,439
we don't we that's why i'm saying we we

307
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,240
qualify these raw materials to be these

308
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,880
really pure

309
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,879
sources so like if we're using a

310
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:56,320
potassium source

311
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:58,159
we would choose something like a

312
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,800
potassium nitrate which

313
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:01,360
is super and even the the grade of it is

314
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:04,399
super

315
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,639
um soluble and available and it's

316
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,799
you know giving potassium to the plant

317
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:10,399
attached to a nitrate

318
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:11,838
you know some other things you can see

319
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,240
but in the

320
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,519
you know grocery stores of these not so

321
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,159
great fertilizers

322
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,039
have a potassium source as a potassium

323
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:21,679
chloride

324
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:23,599
i mean no plant wants to have a root

325
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:25,679
zone filled with chloride and yes you

326
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:29,440
will get potassium from it

327
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:32,958
but it's also coming with this salt

328
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,480
that isn't great so if that kind of

329
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:37,439
makes sense you have like

330
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,399
good mineral salts and bad mineral salts

331
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,320
you know what i mean

332
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:44,240
does that yeah

333
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,160
one other aspect of that too i would

334
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,480
think in terms of sustainability is not

335
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:49,039
over

336
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,560
applying these chemical fertilizers so

337
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:53,360
your spent media

338
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:54,159
at the end of your grow should be fairly

339
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,639
low ec

340
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:59,278
i would expect if you want to do this as

341
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:01,519
sustainably as possible

342
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:02,639
yeah and that's one of the cool things

343
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:06,000
that

344
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:07,680
when we work with growers

345
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,278
and we work with a lot of like hybrid

346
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:10,958
growers too that

347
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:12,958
you know obviously aren't like omri

348
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:14,879
listed type people but are trying to

349
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:15,759
build the sustainability of their

350
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:17,919
operation

351
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:20,399
so they're using a a mixture of a

352
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:23,919
mineral and an organic approach

353
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:25,839
but we we go crop by crop and develop

354
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:29,439
these nutrient targets

355
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:32,480
so you're looking at okay

356
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:35,040
you know i only need 30

357
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,039
parts per million of phosphorus that's

358
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:37,679
all we're trying to deliver how do we

359
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:39,278
get there

360
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:41,679
you know what i mean like are you using

361
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:44,958
this as a nutrient amendment

362
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:46,159
we'll use some water soluble as like an

363
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:49,518
available kind of

364
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:52,719
shot of of a fertilizer solution

365
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:55,120
but in reality we are never

366
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,399
we're trying never to over apply because

367
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,078
the plant doesn't need

368
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:01,600
more you know what i mean more isn't

369
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:03,278
better in most cases

370
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,560
yeah and just to be fair i want to talk

371
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:06,958
about some of the pros and cons on the

372
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:08,799
organic side

373
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:10,559
so in terms of organics i think the

374
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:13,120
advantages we have are that it is

375
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:13,119
organic

376
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,079
which is a big big point to a lot of

377
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,759
people including myself

378
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:21,359
some of the challenges and disadvantages

379
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:23,039
are that we we can't quite hit these

380
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,919
targets quite as exactly because

381
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:25,278
nutrients are

382
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:27,838
being released over time they're

383
00:13:25,278 --> 00:13:30,720
requiring microbial

384
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:33,760
action or process in order to become

385
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,519
available to the plant in most cases

386
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:37,039
there are still some sustainability

387
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,440
issues depending on what

388
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:40,879
that uh nutrient is and where it's

389
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,800
sourced from that amendment you know

390
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:44,480
coming some cocoa core comes from

391
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:45,838
tropical locations uh

392
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,320
you know neem karan just some of these

393
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:52,639
things are not locally produced so there

394
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:54,320
is that fossil fuel cost to get it to us

395
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,839
some of the advantages are that we a lot

396
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,278
of people are reusing their soil and

397
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,160
that's something that we talk about

398
00:13:57,278 --> 00:14:00,958
here that i work with a lot of growers

399
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:02,719
on

400
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:04,000
but that doesn't give us the same level

401
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,800
of consistency

402
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,399
that you would get from you know a

403
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:10,319
mineral salt program

404
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,078
so i think that's uh you know i just

405
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,079
want to be fair here in terms of the the

406
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:17,278
pros and cons on both sides

407
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:19,039
um oh yeah and i

408
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:21,039
it sounds silly but being a plant

409
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:23,519
nutritionist that i you know

410
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:25,360
and and and the chemistry side the like

411
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:28,399
alchemy side of

412
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:30,800
mixing things together to like provide

413
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,839
nutrients to the plant i'm always open

414
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:33,759
to

415
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,680
you know coming up and working with

416
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:38,958
growers with these hybrid programs

417
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:40,799
or even just helping them understand the

418
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:42,638
nutrient profile with whatever they're

419
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:44,958
using so that's kind of the fun

420
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,919
side of what we do here at jr peters

421
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:49,679
because we have our

422
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:51,519
lab we get to really look at the crop

423
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:53,120
and and how people are growing it all

424
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,440
different ways so

425
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:58,399
i love these heated debates this isn't

426
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:01,519
too heated though tags so uh you know

427
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:03,120
just good conversation sure sure no we

428
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,399
have a lot of mutual friends and i've

429
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,000
heard such great stuff about you i'm

430
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:09,039
certainly not going to

431
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,240
be too hard on you i here's one though

432
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:11,360
that might be a little bit more

433
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,440
contentious

434
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,440
i've always thought it was a little

435
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,199
arrogant of us as humans to think that

436
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,760
we could formulate

437
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:20,319
a nutrient solution for a plant better

438
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:23,278
than

439
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,720
nature now not when it comes to yield

440
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:26,559
necessarily but i mean

441
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,720
that kind of brings in the whole idea of

442
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:30,399
steroids you know obviously we can pump

443
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,720
a plant full of something and grow it

444
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,879
bigger but is it healthier or is new or

445
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,278
is nutritious or going to have the same

446
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:41,039
terpene expression as you might get from

447
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:42,958
you know a well-managed organic grow

448
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:44,799
yeah and that's definitely something

449
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:47,278
that that we discuss

450
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:48,399
constantly here in our like inner tech

451
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:51,600
team meetings

452
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:54,159
you know are we truly

453
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,800
missing out because we're just so

454
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:57,838
focused

455
00:15:54,799 --> 00:16:00,240
on these targets and that's why we

456
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:02,000
we're always you know looking at you

457
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,360
know other additives and things

458
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,480
that might be useful in enhancing a root

459
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,600
zone but

460
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:12,720
i hear what you're saying for sure

461
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:15,360
and you know unfortunately like the fun

462
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:18,800
part of my job is being so like

463
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,759
like um intense on this mineral side

464
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:22,879
that

465
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:25,360
you kind of you know love to hear

466
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:27,679
everyone's opinion but we still just

467
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,240
with jax are trying to make sure we have

468
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:32,479
the most soluble and available mineral

469
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,480
blends so it does kind of put blinders

470
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,839
on if you know what i mean

471
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,800
a bit well i i will admit i am jealous

472
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:42,320
in your ability

473
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:43,439
to research and and do studies because

474
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,278
you know a lot of people don't want to

475
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,920
touch organics in a lot of ways because

476
00:16:45,278 --> 00:16:49,360
there are

477
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:51,439
so many variables involved in every um

478
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,600
growing scenario especially when we talk

479
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,120
about soils or living soils as people

480
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,800
are calling them

481
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,799
really really hard to do research on it

482
00:16:56,799 --> 00:17:01,039
compared to

483
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:02,559
you know a chemical grow like this with

484
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:03,838
an inert media or something that's

485
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:06,558
really consistent so

486
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:08,000
in that sense i i am jealous of your

487
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:11,279
ability to do research

488
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,160
in a lot of this stuff and i think too

489
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:16,959
like what was what you know the the

490
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,038
background of our company is mostly like

491
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:21,759
especially ag and horticulture back when

492
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:24,558
it started in the 40s and 50s

493
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:26,558
but as cannabis has really you know

494
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:30,720
stepped into the limelight over

495
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:31,599
you know with in the illegal and legal

496
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,000
side of it

497
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:35,678
we've gotten to see so many more people

498
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,279
kind of jumping into this and what i'm

499
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,280
super excited for

500
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:40,720
is now finally the universities are

501
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:43,798
going to be able to

502
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,440
you know put out some of these

503
00:17:43,798 --> 00:17:48,720
research-based

504
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,240
um studies and and bring some of this to

505
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,160
light a little bit more than what what

506
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,160
has gone on in the past and i think that

507
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:57,360
will help all of us

508
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,160
really jump into the perfect kind of

509
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:00,159
scenario

510
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,360
and exactly what you're saying like

511
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,798
plant yield

512
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:06,159
plant quality and um expression of the

513
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:08,160
final product too for

514
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,759
hemp and cannabis and that's that's what

515
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,919
excites us here at jax

516
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:13,679
we we work with a lot of different

517
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:17,038
universities to kind of

518
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:17,679
you know provide the the mineral side of

519
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:20,558
it

520
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,759
so i can't wait to see that as we you

521
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:25,519
know move forward

522
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:27,599
2021 and beyond yeah now

523
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:28,639
i'm under the impression that if we're

524
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:31,599
talking about

525
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,320
strictly yield that a combination of

526
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:35,599
organics

527
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:37,359
and synthetics is the optimal way for

528
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:39,199
for increasing and getting the highest

529
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:41,918
levels of yield and i'm saying this

530
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,640
only based on my own anecdotal evidence

531
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,320
and

532
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,480
what i've seen out of the giant pumpkin

533
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:48,000
growers you know they kind of maxed out

534
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:52,319
around 2000

535
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:54,558
pounds oh sorry around a thousand pounds

536
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:56,639
back in the 90s and then they started

537
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:58,399
incorporating you know some biologicals

538
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,559
like mycorrhizal fungus started treating

539
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:03,200
their patches with a little bit more

540
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:04,399
care from an organic perspective and

541
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,600
along with genetic

542
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:09,840
improvements which is huge um as well

543
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:11,279
they've they're now up over 500 pounds

544
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:12,639
with these these pumpkins and it's

545
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:13,759
pretty incredible and it's sort of this

546
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,080
hybrid method

547
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:17,759
um what is your experience with sort of

548
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:19,439
you know hybrid methods in regards to

549
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:21,679
yield versus

550
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,440
you know a strict organic or mineral

551
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:26,400
salt approach

552
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:28,160
well like i said this is the this is the

553
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,440
cool part about having the lab here

554
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,600
because we're kind of we're

555
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,558
really able to work with growers doing

556
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:36,159
all different things

557
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:39,519
to kind of track where they started

558
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:43,038
what amendments they're using and then

559
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:45,038
match that to data to like nutrient

560
00:19:43,038 --> 00:19:46,160
concentrations in the tissue and in the

561
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:48,319
root zone

562
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,519
so we've seen a lot of different things

563
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:52,319
and like

564
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:55,038
it's it's so difficult for me

565
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:56,240
specifically to say oh i lean one way or

566
00:19:55,038 --> 00:20:00,960
another because i

567
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:03,120
i feel that people tend to have

568
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,240
i don't know their own ability to make

569
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:07,439
whatever choice

570
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:09,359
they decide to go with work well i've

571
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:12,000
seen a lot of growers using

572
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:12,798
strict mineral fertilizers ours or

573
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,919
otherwise

574
00:20:12,798 --> 00:20:16,879
do unbelievable yields in hemp and

575
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:19,840
cannabis

576
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:22,080
and then again i've seen other growers

577
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:23,439
really be able to cultivate this living

578
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:26,158
soil

579
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,480
you not even utilize a mineral component

580
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:29,600
at

581
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:31,759
all and be able to reach very similar

582
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:33,359
or you know exactly the same type of

583
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:36,400
yield

584
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:36,959
in in in the same varieties that they're

585
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,400
growing

586
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:42,640
so it's it's so many factors i think now

587
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,559
tad that it's hard to

588
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,240
you know say one yeah one way is better

589
00:20:44,558 --> 00:20:48,000
than another so i agree with you this

590
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,480
hybrid approach i've found has

591
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,440
been really successful for most people

592
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,558
either starting

593
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,120
out in their own like home environments

594
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:57,119
or

595
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:58,158
even slightly larger than that or moving

596
00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:00,719
forward

597
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:02,640
but i have to say there's there are a

598
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:06,558
lot of growers we work with

599
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:09,600
that have these multi-state operations

600
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:12,798
that really are on the path

601
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:13,678
to you know making this as efficient as

602
00:21:12,798 --> 00:21:15,918
possible

603
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:18,240
so i know you talked about that in the

604
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:21,280
beginning that efficiency

605
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:23,599
and you know when you look at

606
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:25,519
how much these inputs cost and the

607
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:26,079
sustainability of where you're getting

608
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:28,158
them from

609
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:29,839
that's going to be very important as

610
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:33,520
this market kind of

611
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:36,319
moves forward and the mineral

612
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:37,279
side of it does have a really low cost

613
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:39,359
in use

614
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:41,200
you know when you're talking about like

615
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:43,918
how much the powder costs

616
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,840
versus all these liquid amendments being

617
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:48,559
shipped all over the country

618
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:48,959
so yeah absolutely very interesting to

619
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:50,798
see

620
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,400
i mean if if you're gonna go with a

621
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:54,480
mineral salt i think

622
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,240
you know powdered is the way to go

623
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,558
people can mix with their own water

624
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,558
um

625
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:05,519
well um you know i feel like we've

626
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:07,519
covered that

627
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:09,038
pretty well i know people are going to

628
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:10,798
want to talk about water

629
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:12,319
um you've mentioned how your experience

630
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:13,918
with heavy metals

631
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:15,678
why don't we start there though because

632
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:18,400
i you know i talk to people

633
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,960
all the time and that's always a

634
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,000
challenge

635
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:25,519
is you know limiting arsenic limiting

636
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,279
cadmium lead for example where are you

637
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:28,960
finding these cropping up the most what

638
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:31,599
are the like most common

639
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,038
sources of contamination um you know

640
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:36,480
obviously nutrient solution

641
00:22:33,038 --> 00:22:37,679
soil are big ones um water

642
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,759
what other things should people be

643
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:42,480
watching for if they want to limit

644
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:43,919
their exposure to these well

645
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,798
specifically i see

646
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:49,038
a lot of heavy metals coming in as

647
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:51,519
carrier

648
00:22:49,038 --> 00:22:52,640
i guess byproducts in these individual

649
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:56,158
nutrients

650
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:59,520
so you know if you're adding in

651
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:03,039
some sort of nitrogen or calcium

652
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:04,558
source as into your root zone you got to

653
00:23:03,038 --> 00:23:05,919
watch for the heavy metals there one of

654
00:23:04,558 --> 00:23:08,558
the things that we see quite

655
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:10,480
often is people are using gypsum in

656
00:23:08,558 --> 00:23:12,798
their root zone to try and

657
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,558
you know add a soluble calcium source

658
00:23:12,798 --> 00:23:17,918
that's a little long

659
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:21,038
little longer lasting and doesn't um

660
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:22,159
affect the ph of the root zone we found

661
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:25,440
a lot of gypsum

662
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:27,280
sources having cadmium cadmiums

663
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,240
basically the main one

664
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:31,599
but we've also seen arsenic and lead in

665
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,120
there and that's just

666
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:34,959
something that you don't think of you're

667
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:38,000
like oh gypsum that's

668
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,840
you know a really nice way to get a good

669
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,319
calcium source and then you don't

670
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:45,678
realize it's coming with all of these

671
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:48,879
kind of carrier terrible things in there

672
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:52,559
um i'm trying to think like we also

673
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,760
seem to in almost every single nutrient

674
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:56,319
that we're

675
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:58,400
we're bringing in as a raw material from

676
00:23:56,319 --> 00:24:01,439
sources all over the world

677
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:04,480
we always see some level

678
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,558
or another of heavy metals in there so

679
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,240
for people to say oh i'm doing stuff

680
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:11,119
that has zero heavy metals

681
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,798
it's impossible it's always there it's

682
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:15,918
just trying to get

683
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:16,319
a refined material that has the lowest

684
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:19,038
amount

685
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:19,839
possible that that's what we strive at

686
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:22,558
jax and it's

687
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:24,480
very very difficult we we have a whole

688
00:24:22,558 --> 00:24:26,720
kind of qaqc

689
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,960
qualification process to try and keep

690
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,480
these levels as low as possible

691
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,759
and we're paying attention can you

692
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,960
imagine if people weren't paying

693
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:35,440
attention

694
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,759
you know that's what worries me yeah

695
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,360
it's a challenge

696
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:42,000
i have a few thoughts on that so first

697
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:44,319
off like i chose to get my soil

698
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,079
registered as a fertilizer so it would

699
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:47,599
have heavy metal testing and come under

700
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:48,960
that same level of scrutiny as your

701
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:49,439
fertilizers because i think that's

702
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,440
important

703
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,480
yeah i don't know anyone else that's

704
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,558
doing that but

705
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,480
um there's a lot of challenges around it

706
00:24:54,558 --> 00:24:58,399
like you said and

707
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,240
you know especially on the organic side

708
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,080
you know we're testing our amendments

709
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,440
but you know things can change batch to

710
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:04,720
batch and so we're constantly trying to

711
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,640
monitor that

712
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,798
um you know you said gypsum that wasn't

713
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,080
even really one on my radar i think of

714
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:11,918
like rock dusts

715
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:13,678
um for example that people are using

716
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:15,919
kelp meal

717
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:17,600
things like that for inputs um feather

718
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:20,400
meal yeah

719
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:21,439
but um yeah i think it's i think it's

720
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,840
something growers really

721
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,840
need to be aware of and monitor but

722
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:27,519
let's say you had a field that

723
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:28,959
did have you know you had a crop that

724
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:31,519
failed

725
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,200
at that point what what would you try

726
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:34,720
and do to remediate that would you have

727
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,759
them grow a hemp crop

728
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:39,200
or some other accumulator possibly to

729
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:41,200
get some of that

730
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:44,240
you know arsenic or something into the

731
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:46,000
the biomass of the plant to dispose of

732
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,440
how do we manage i think things like

733
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,640
that i think that

734
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:53,759
that is where hopefully

735
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,080
we will be able to move um over the you

736
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:57,278
know

737
00:25:54,079 --> 00:26:00,319
future years to come here because the

738
00:25:57,278 --> 00:26:03,440
hyper accumulator research like we know

739
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:06,720
that there's certain species of plants

740
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:10,480
that take up heavy metals really well

741
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:13,839
and they do that up in at least

742
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:16,640
six to eight inches of the root zone so

743
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:17,278
by planting like a crop a cover crop

744
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,679
almost and

745
00:26:17,278 --> 00:26:22,319
some of these are like you know from the

746
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:24,159
mustard family or sunflower family or

747
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:26,960
cabbage family and

748
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:28,320
and just planting a crop of of those

749
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:31,600
types of

750
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:33,759
plants to remove the heavy metals and

751
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:34,639
and we know that they're excellent at

752
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:38,558
cadmium

753
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:40,640
zinc nickel selenium the ones we

754
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:42,558
know that have harder problems are like

755
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:46,400
arsenic in there but

756
00:26:42,558 --> 00:26:49,918
um it would be that's the way to go

757
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:52,080
i just don't know how

758
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:54,240
often people are thinking of doing that

759
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:56,879
right now i know a few growers that

760
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,558
are growing outside in these situations

761
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,278
in areas of the

762
00:26:58,558 --> 00:27:03,599
of the us here that do have soils that

763
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:06,319
are extremely high in heavy metals

764
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:06,798
and not only is it just it in the root

765
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:09,918
zone

766
00:27:06,798 --> 00:27:12,960
it's also like the dust so if like it's

767
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,520
dusty and you get that dust on your

768
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,319
plants

769
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:18,158
you can effectively fail a crop because

770
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:21,038
that dust is now stuck

771
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:22,159
to your you know your sticky butt and

772
00:27:21,038 --> 00:27:25,278
it's been a real

773
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:26,559
real problem um around the country

774
00:27:25,278 --> 00:27:29,119
and let's be fair that some of these

775
00:27:26,558 --> 00:27:31,119
testing um

776
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:32,158
things are showing huge variability i

777
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:33,599
found in

778
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:35,200
the results that growers are getting so

779
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:37,359
they'll pass at one lab and fail

780
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,240
another um so we obviously have

781
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:40,240
variability there

782
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,240
some of the laws i think are a little

783
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,519
too stringent around this since we don't

784
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:46,798
really know

785
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:48,319
what levels are acceptable or safe

786
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:49,839
and we're not testing our vegetables

787
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:51,038
like this it's really crazy that

788
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:54,398
cannabis has this

789
00:27:51,038 --> 00:27:56,798
completely different standard um

790
00:27:54,398 --> 00:27:58,879
i i don't know i 100 agree it's

791
00:27:56,798 --> 00:28:02,000
frustrating it's extremely frustrating

792
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:04,960
and like i also feel like the the

793
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,278
group that regulates this in our country

794
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,399
is

795
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:10,079
um the american um plant food control

796
00:28:08,398 --> 00:28:11,519
officials that do a lot of regulating

797
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:13,759
for like you said you're registering

798
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:17,038
your soils as a fertilizer

799
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:19,440
they are uh definitely a smart

800
00:28:17,038 --> 00:28:21,119
group of people but they are operating

801
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:24,320
on a state level

802
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:25,278
so it's there's just even from one state

803
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:27,119
to another there's

804
00:28:25,278 --> 00:28:28,960
all these different requirements and

805
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:31,599
recommendations that

806
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,640
you know could really be useful if we

807
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:35,759
are going to

808
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:38,080
you know step cannabis and and quality

809
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:40,398
products coming into our country

810
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:41,599
how it's regulated needs to be something

811
00:28:40,398 --> 00:28:44,158
that's that's on

812
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:46,158
a larger level and not specific to each

813
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:48,640
state it's super frustrating

814
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:50,640
as i'm sure you know in registration to

815
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:54,000
try and make sense of

816
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:56,480
you know what people are asking for

817
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,440
so it's tough so we just at jax we just

818
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,519
try and

819
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,720
qualify every raw material to have the

820
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:03,839
lowest possible

821
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:06,720
and and keep that in a non-detectable or

822
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:08,720
you know as low as possible for all of

823
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:13,038
these specific heavy metals

824
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:14,319
and it's it keeps us busy for sure

825
00:29:13,038 --> 00:29:15,759
yeah we're doing a similar thing in

826
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:17,278
terms of just trying to be as low as

827
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:19,679
possible and constantly

828
00:29:17,278 --> 00:29:21,200
trying to innovate if we find ways to

829
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:23,679
you know lower our

830
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,720
our levels even more but it's a it's a

831
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:27,278
constant

832
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:29,440
process one thing i do want to mention

833
00:29:27,278 --> 00:29:30,720
too is that genetics appears to play a

834
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,640
pretty big role

835
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,558
in all of this as well so people need to

836
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:37,038
be aware of that

837
00:29:34,558 --> 00:29:39,359
i'm seeing a lot of times where just a

838
00:29:37,038 --> 00:29:41,278
portion of a crop will fail

839
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:43,439
so obviously a cultivar selection is

840
00:29:41,278 --> 00:29:44,720
huge um when it comes to this heavy

841
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,038
metal uptake

842
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,720
you know something to consider i 100

843
00:29:47,038 --> 00:29:49,359
agree that's why it'll be kind of neat

844
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,038
to see

845
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:54,079
if we start to really pull out these

846
00:29:53,038 --> 00:29:56,240
cultivars that

847
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:57,199
are the high performers and and we can

848
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,440
also

849
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,200
you know pay attention to those other

850
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,480
traits like heavy metal hyper

851
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,679
accumulation

852
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:07,679
and get that data out for others to

853
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,919
so that when we're you know growers are

854
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:10,320
making selections on what they want to

855
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:12,720
grow

856
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:13,439
or what they want to breed themselves

857
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:17,038
they can

858
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,440
um you know utilize some of the data

859
00:30:17,038 --> 00:30:19,278
that

860
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,960
they have on these cultivars and it's

861
00:30:19,278 --> 00:30:22,000
not kind of like oh my friend down the

862
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,960
street's growing this

863
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,720
and that worked well that type of thing

864
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,319
and that will only come in time as

865
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,240
there's more like research

866
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:33,119
kind of published and out there for us

867
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:36,480
to ponder

868
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:39,038
so when we talk about you know using

869
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,480
mineral salts a lot of people on the

870
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:43,278
organic side

871
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,640
uh you know are are concerned that these

872
00:30:43,278 --> 00:30:47,679
salts are going to be killing

873
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:49,759
off microorganisms in their soil

874
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,960
if they're also gardening in a manner

875
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:52,960
that

876
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,399
includes you know biological inputs

877
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,159
compost things you know they're trying

878
00:30:54,398 --> 00:30:59,199
to get nutrient cycling

879
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:00,559
going from a microbial perspective what

880
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:06,000
are the effects of salts

881
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:06,000
on you know on soils

882
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:09,119
well that's that's a great question and

883
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:12,240
that's something that we get

884
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:15,439
asked quite a bit um because

885
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:17,599
again there is a lot of misconception

886
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:20,159
out there when you're thinking about you

887
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:22,639
know people saying oh it's salt

888
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:24,720
so there there's a qualification of like

889
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:28,000
good salts and bad salts

890
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,880
and obviously um the bad salts are the

891
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,880
things that you

892
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,000
you probably think of sodium and

893
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,159
chloride

894
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,558
and they're they're the ones that that

895
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:40,880
can have quite a

896
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:42,240
destructive characteristic in the root

897
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:45,200
zone because

898
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,000
the plant is it needs there is some

899
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,640
requirement

900
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,480
for a sodium or chloride ion in the life

901
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:53,360
cycle of any plant growing

902
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,640
but it's super low and this is where and

903
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:55,599
i know you said this in the beginning

904
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,720
you talk about

905
00:31:55,599 --> 00:32:01,359
application rate so

906
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:03,120
providing nutrients to the soil in the

907
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:05,439
right concentration

908
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:08,239
so that they're available for plant

909
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:11,519
uptake and also for soil microbe use

910
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:13,278
you know nutrients are a source of food

911
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:14,798
for the good things that live in your

912
00:32:13,278 --> 00:32:17,200
soil too

913
00:32:14,798 --> 00:32:19,519
and they're not qualifying it as oh this

914
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:22,159
calcium is coming from a mineral base

915
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:23,839
versus an organic base they're seeing

916
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:27,200
that nutrient as a

917
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:29,839
as a charged entity and utilize it that

918
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:33,200
way as a food source or otherwise

919
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:33,678
but if you're you know slamming it down

920
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,120
there and

921
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:39,840
bombarding things with calcium magnesium

922
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:40,839
phosphorus nitrogen it's just going to

923
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:43,519
be like an

924
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:44,639
overload and you can do quite a bit of

925
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:47,679
the damage

926
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:50,000
you know as as and what people have seen

927
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:51,759
is you know killing off these wonderful

928
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,480
environments because the application

929
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:55,519
rate was

930
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:58,558
was way too high so

931
00:32:55,519 --> 00:33:01,278
on our side of things we always cr

932
00:32:58,558 --> 00:33:03,599
try and get people to understand the the

933
00:33:01,278 --> 00:33:04,640
concept of like a constant liquid

934
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:08,079
feeding which is

935
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:10,480
really a low low rate and overall

936
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:12,000
parts per million of a nutrient solution

937
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,798
that's quite a bit lower than

938
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,440
then you would see or think about and

939
00:33:14,798 --> 00:33:17,759
feeding

940
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,200
that every time the pla every time the

941
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:21,679
plant needs water

942
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,038
so it's getting this constant low stream

943
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:25,120
of a balanced

944
00:33:23,038 --> 00:33:26,879
nutrition from a mineral from our

945
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:30,639
mineral type source

946
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:32,880
does that make sense yeah so

947
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,480
low levels of mineral salts are saying

948
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,240
are not going to necessarily cause this

949
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:39,120
osmotic shock in your

950
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:41,278
soil and kill off all the microorganisms

951
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:45,119
when they're applied at a proper

952
00:33:41,278 --> 00:33:46,880
dosage right correct

953
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:48,558
and and then to kind of follow up on

954
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:51,039
that question how do

955
00:33:48,558 --> 00:33:52,720
chemical fertilizers interact with

956
00:33:51,038 --> 00:33:54,398
biostimulants

957
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,960
and when i say biostimulants i'm talking

958
00:33:54,398 --> 00:33:59,678
about you know microbial

959
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:01,200
products that are added to the soil

960
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:04,720
things that contain you know

961
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:07,120
bacillus optilis you know pseudomonas

962
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,480
trichoderma you know these sorts of like

963
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:10,319
specialized

964
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:13,440
microbial products that that we're

965
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:16,159
seeing pop up a lot more in agriculture

966
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:18,800
yeah and it's kind of neat you know

967
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:21,358
seeing the data behind it too that

968
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,000
show that these products do have such a

969
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:24,799
benefit

970
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,800
in in building a healthy root zone to

971
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:29,839
allow the roots to kind of have this

972
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:33,839
symbiosis of like

973
00:34:29,838 --> 00:34:37,039
their water and the organic

974
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:38,799
elements that are in the root zone um

975
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:40,639
you know when it comes down to it and

976
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:43,599
you see this in the good and bad too a

977
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:46,960
bad example of it is the chesapeake bay

978
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:50,000
nutrients mineral salts or otherwise

979
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:52,480
act as food for

980
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,039
as a food source as an energy source for

981
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,079
these

982
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:59,440
these in this case of these good

983
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:02,640
biostimulants in the root zone so again

984
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:05,200
they're useful in that they're providing

985
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:07,920
a very soluble and available

986
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:09,358
energy source right that they don't

987
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,200
really have to work for

988
00:35:09,358 --> 00:35:14,159
you know kind of just bumps right into

989
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:15,199
them and it causes those populations to

990
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:18,000
thrive

991
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:19,439
again we go back to the thing of

992
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,320
application rate

993
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,760
you overdo this even slightly and you're

994
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,559
going to see negative effects

995
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:28,960
quickly but if you do provide it in a

996
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:30,799
way that it is this constant energy

997
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,480
source so you're providing like a

998
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,240
thriving environment for these

999
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:38,159
biostimulants you can

1000
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:41,199
really see the positive effects of them

1001
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:43,279
in your your growing environment quickly

1002
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:44,879
because it's like oh yay look at this

1003
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,119
this makes me happy

1004
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,039
i'm gonna grow well and then it's gonna

1005
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:51,358
provide such a positive benefit for the

1006
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:52,800
plant growth too

1007
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:54,719
now what are you seeing specifically

1008
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,000
with mycorrhizal fungus you know i've

1009
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:59,439
heard high p

1010
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,119
can cause the you know reduce infection

1011
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,000
rates because the plant's getting what

1012
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:05,838
it needs

1013
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:07,838
directly already from from a fertilizer

1014
00:36:05,838 --> 00:36:09,759
source

1015
00:36:07,838 --> 00:36:12,559
in terms of cannabis and mycorrhizal

1016
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:14,720
fungus are you seeing any research there

1017
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:18,320
or any results

1018
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:20,559
in your programs you know we

1019
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,838
jack the jacks programs that we put

1020
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:24,559
together have a very

1021
00:36:21,838 --> 00:36:25,838
different kind of outlook on phosphorus

1022
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:29,199
levels and application

1023
00:36:25,838 --> 00:36:33,679
then you will see kind of out

1024
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:37,039
and you know scrolling the internet

1025
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:40,239
our application of phosphorus is

1026
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:43,039
a targeted time and a

1027
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:45,118
that that is right at between the

1028
00:36:43,039 --> 00:36:45,838
vegetative and reproductive state where

1029
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:48,880
we really

1030
00:36:45,838 --> 00:36:49,920
flood the root zone with phosphorus to

1031
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:53,200
kind of

1032
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:54,960
stimulate the change from the vegetative

1033
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:56,960
state to reproductive

1034
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,159
and then we shut it off so it's almost

1035
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:01,280
like a one little

1036
00:36:58,159 --> 00:37:03,279
shot booth um i

1037
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:05,359
from what i've heard and the growers

1038
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:07,119
that we work with we haven't seen any

1039
00:37:05,358 --> 00:37:11,279
negative effects

1040
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:14,079
on this you know short targeted amount

1041
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:16,640
of phosphorus at this stage

1042
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:17,280
we have heard from other growers though

1043
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:19,920
that if you

1044
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:21,280
use phosphorus at the high rates that

1045
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,519
you often will see

1046
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,400
people saying that that cannabis does

1047
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:26,559
quite

1048
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:28,880
well with these high you know you see

1049
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:32,400
these blossom boosters of like

1050
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:35,119
50 available p205

1051
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,760
that that it has had a negative effect

1052
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:37,519
for

1053
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,800
you know the infection rates of fungi

1054
00:37:37,519 --> 00:37:40,639
but

1055
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:42,240
you know i don't know it's one of those

1056
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:45,039
things with our

1057
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:45,598
our the research that we do here is we

1058
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:48,079
haven't

1059
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:50,640
done any trials ourselves it's working

1060
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:53,119
with growers and hearing their

1061
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:54,639
recommendations and and the positive and

1062
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:56,800
negative that they've been

1063
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:57,920
kind of able to reflect with us but our

1064
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,400
way of going about

1065
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:01,280
phosphorus is is quite different than

1066
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:04,160
others

1067
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:05,040
so we get a lot of feedback to that too

1068
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:07,598
like wait a second

1069
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:08,400
i should be using like a blossom booster

1070
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:11,599
all through

1071
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:13,599
flower and we're like no you use it for

1072
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:16,400
a five to seven day period

1073
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:18,480
potentially ten day period and that's it

1074
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,838
with the jax program so it's a little

1075
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,920
different

1076
00:38:19,838 --> 00:38:23,679
well i'm convinced that in general

1077
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,358
growers still are over applying

1078
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:27,039
phosphorus though it's gotten better but

1079
00:38:25,358 --> 00:38:29,598
there was this idea that

1080
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:32,800
plants need nitrogen and veg and

1081
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:32,800
phosphorus and flour

1082
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:38,320
i hear that a lot all the time too i'm

1083
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,680
convinced that it's really potassium

1084
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,280
that's it's leading to a lot of the

1085
00:38:39,679 --> 00:38:43,679
yield increases that we're seeing

1086
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,960
and so um and i could be wrong you know

1087
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:47,519
you're the plant

1088
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:49,599
nutrient or nutritionist here but it

1089
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:52,639
seems to me that potassium is a much

1090
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:53,359
uh more important element when we talk

1091
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:56,559
about

1092
00:38:53,358 --> 00:38:58,000
you know finishing versus these pk

1093
00:38:56,559 --> 00:38:59,519
boosters i'm not sure the peas really

1094
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,480
doing a whole heck of a lot

1095
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:03,679
at that stage but um you know i want to

1096
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,280
ask you about this so i'm looking at

1097
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:07,358
your formulations right now

1098
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:09,519
on your website um and you have these

1099
00:39:07,358 --> 00:39:11,679
these very specific ratios

1100
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:13,838
can you talk a little bit about uh you

1101
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:15,358
know why and how you came up with these

1102
00:39:13,838 --> 00:39:17,519
formulations because this is something

1103
00:39:15,358 --> 00:39:18,880
we can apply to organics as well

1104
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:20,800
um yeah i think we can take some of

1105
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:23,280
these and um

1106
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,640
you know try and hit targets closer to

1107
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,040
them based on the research that's being

1108
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:26,838
done

1109
00:39:25,039 --> 00:39:28,079
by you know companies and people like

1110
00:39:26,838 --> 00:39:31,039
you

1111
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:31,519
yeah well you you hit it right on the

1112
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:34,639
head

1113
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:35,599
it's all about the ratios so a lot of

1114
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:38,960
times when

1115
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:42,079
i'm building formulas for cannabis or

1116
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:44,000
other crops it's about making sure we

1117
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:47,760
have those balanced ratios

1118
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:49,920
in between nitrogen and potassium or

1119
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,040
phosphorus or calcium and magnesium and

1120
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,200
sulfur or

1121
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:55,199
even the micronutrients iron some

1122
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:59,039
manganese and then

1123
00:39:55,199 --> 00:40:00,239
zinc boron and copper we specifically

1124
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:03,279
pay attention to

1125
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:05,358
the ratios between that um

1126
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,880
when we're building for specific crops

1127
00:40:05,358 --> 00:40:10,559
so

1128
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:11,440
super important for the way we set up

1129
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:14,559
our our jax

1130
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:17,200
nutrients we've we started developing

1131
00:40:14,559 --> 00:40:21,440
these formulas in 2010

1132
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:24,399
and um you know people have used our

1133
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:25,679
version of jax or peter's fertilizer

1134
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,559
before that

1135
00:40:25,679 --> 00:40:29,838
you know to grow cannabis and they used

1136
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:32,239
all different formulas

1137
00:40:29,838 --> 00:40:34,318
and we would look at it and go what are

1138
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:35,439
you doing they would specifically use

1139
00:40:34,318 --> 00:40:38,400
triple 20

1140
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:41,200
20 20 20 in veg and then the blossom

1141
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:43,119
booster 10 30 20 all through flower

1142
00:40:41,199 --> 00:40:45,279
or they would use this old school one

1143
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:48,880
which is called variegated violet

1144
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:52,480
which was a 10 52 10 all through flower

1145
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:54,318
and we would be like this is ridiculous

1146
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,159
why are people doing this but this was

1147
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:57,358
like you know what everyone thought that

1148
00:40:56,159 --> 00:40:59,440
you should do

1149
00:40:57,358 --> 00:41:01,679
even now you'll see people using our

1150
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,800
triple 20 and blossom booster 2 as part

1151
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:06,799
of the

1152
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:08,720
garden line but when we started to dive

1153
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,960
in there and really look at the

1154
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:13,439
the genetics and the and the cultivars

1155
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:15,760
and the species that were available

1156
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:17,760
when we started and and started playing

1157
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,400
with it we found that manipulating

1158
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,839
ratios

1159
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:25,200
at the different crop stages

1160
00:41:21,838 --> 00:41:25,759
really led to an overall healthier

1161
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:28,078
looking

1162
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:30,400
crop that's how we started it like we

1163
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:34,318
were just going for

1164
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:36,318
let's try and make a a crop of you know

1165
00:41:34,318 --> 00:41:38,480
this cultivar that looks like a healthy

1166
00:41:36,318 --> 00:41:39,920
plant because we were running into

1167
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:43,440
different growers that would

1168
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:45,599
have like these terribly yellow stocky

1169
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,880
looking things and i'm like this cannot

1170
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:49,599
be good

1171
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:52,160
and then we started playing with the

1172
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:55,119
ratios at the different crop stages

1173
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:56,719
to kind of enhance you know terpene

1174
00:41:55,119 --> 00:42:00,160
expression and yield

1175
00:41:56,719 --> 00:42:02,719
and that's how we eventually from 2010

1176
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:05,838
to the release of this line in 2017

1177
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:07,919
kind of dialed in the formulas that you

1178
00:42:05,838 --> 00:42:11,519
see as part of jack's nutrients

1179
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:12,318
does that make sense yeah yeah it does i

1180
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:14,318
see

1181
00:42:12,318 --> 00:42:15,440
um and i'm trying to read your website

1182
00:42:14,318 --> 00:42:17,679
here it looks like

1183
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:19,358
you have a part a and b and so you're

1184
00:42:17,679 --> 00:42:20,239
giving a little bit of phosphorus at the

1185
00:42:19,358 --> 00:42:22,880
beginning

1186
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:24,879
and then you go to a 1500 that's just

1187
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:27,440
purely nitrogen

1188
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:30,079
for veg and then in the part b and then

1189
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:32,639
you switch over into flour

1190
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:34,480
where you give a fair bit uh you have a

1191
00:42:32,639 --> 00:42:37,440
10 30 20 it looks like

1192
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:39,119
and then finished with 7 15 30 and this

1193
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:40,400
is all on the jacks nutrient

1194
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:41,680
website so anyway we can go and look at

1195
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:45,200
this you don't have to you know write

1196
00:42:41,679 --> 00:42:47,199
down or memorize these numbers right

1197
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:48,239
can you uh can you touch on sort of you

1198
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:51,759
know each stage

1199
00:42:48,239 --> 00:42:54,879
just a quick sentence or two on on why

1200
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:58,319
you know from a plant perspective

1201
00:42:54,880 --> 00:43:01,440
yeah so there's really two different

1202
00:42:58,318 --> 00:43:03,679
kind of ways to go about

1203
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:06,079
you know growing with our products we

1204
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:08,879
always start with looking at your water

1205
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:10,480
so we started the water quality at the

1206
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:13,760
source that you'll be growing with

1207
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:16,639
so are you using ro or are you you know

1208
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:18,160
using water from your well or your city

1209
00:43:16,639 --> 00:43:19,679
and we take a look at that and kind of

1210
00:43:18,159 --> 00:43:22,239
form a baseline with

1211
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:23,358
what's what you're starting with and

1212
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:27,759
then we try and

1213
00:43:23,358 --> 00:43:31,440
match that to formula selection

1214
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:35,920
um in veg we really suggest a

1215
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:38,800
lower percent available phosphorus p205

1216
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:40,240
in the vegetative state this so these

1217
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:42,400
formulas you'll see

1218
00:43:40,239 --> 00:43:45,679
appear nitrogen heavy so they'd be like

1219
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:48,880
15 520 which is our top formula or 12 4

1220
00:43:45,679 --> 00:43:50,879
16. so they they appeared

1221
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:53,838
like oh you know it's very nitrogen

1222
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:56,160
heavy which the ratio does allow for but

1223
00:43:53,838 --> 00:43:59,759
you're feeding at a parts per million of

1224
00:43:56,159 --> 00:44:03,279
like 125 to 150

1225
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:06,319
so it's that balance of the nitrogen

1226
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:08,560
to phosphorus to potassium and most of

1227
00:44:06,318 --> 00:44:11,279
the formulas there

1228
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:11,679
do have elevate in the in the nutrient

1229
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:14,880
line

1230
00:44:11,679 --> 00:44:15,199
for for hemp and cannabis almost always

1231
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,838
have

1232
00:44:15,199 --> 00:44:18,799
slightly elevated potassium than

1233
00:44:17,838 --> 00:44:22,000
nitrogen

1234
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:26,000
across all stages um

1235
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:28,239
when we switch the flower there is this

1236
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,679
period of time the bud initiation phase

1237
00:44:28,239 --> 00:44:33,199
where we do

1238
00:44:29,679 --> 00:44:36,078
promote and and use a concentration of

1239
00:44:33,199 --> 00:44:37,919
available phosphorus that does that is

1240
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:38,560
higher than almost anywhere else in our

1241
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,880
programs

1242
00:44:38,559 --> 00:44:43,679
for the short bursts of time and it

1243
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:46,800
basically surrounds the root zone with

1244
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:47,118
phosphorus and that makes it available

1245
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,880
for

1246
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:50,400
plant uptake for the short period of

1247
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:53,280
time it really

1248
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:55,039
you know floods the soil solution the

1249
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:56,720
small and large pore spaces with

1250
00:44:55,039 --> 00:44:59,838
available phosphorus

1251
00:44:56,719 --> 00:45:03,439
and then it's over so by

1252
00:44:59,838 --> 00:45:05,599
continuing by shutting that down

1253
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:07,039
you don't have the negative effects of

1254
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:10,640
phosphorus like you know

1255
00:45:07,039 --> 00:45:12,000
excess stretch and and and that type of

1256
00:45:10,639 --> 00:45:14,639
stuff that

1257
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,000
would cause a crop to really kind of

1258
00:45:14,639 --> 00:45:18,159
look different

1259
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,000
as it grows through its flower stage so

1260
00:45:18,159 --> 00:45:21,118
really it's only that small period of

1261
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,800
time

1262
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:27,519
and then just then as you move to flower

1263
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,480
again we found that the ratios by

1264
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:30,318
decreasing

1265
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:34,159
the nitrogen and increasing the

1266
00:45:30,318 --> 00:45:34,159
potassium so having a slightly

1267
00:45:34,639 --> 00:45:38,799
different ratio for nitrogen to

1268
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:42,159
potassium as the plant goes into its

1269
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:44,960
finished stage it's it's shown

1270
00:45:42,159 --> 00:45:46,078
great benefits to enhancing the yield

1271
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:48,559
and also the terpene

1272
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:49,680
expression and it's also the micros and

1273
00:45:48,559 --> 00:45:52,559
the choice of

1274
00:45:49,679 --> 00:45:54,879
nitrogen that we use at those stages too

1275
00:45:52,559 --> 00:45:55,279
so it's kind of all like a mixture of

1276
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,838
this

1277
00:45:55,280 --> 00:46:01,839
but focusing on ratios through the whole

1278
00:45:58,838 --> 00:46:05,358
program

1279
00:46:01,838 --> 00:46:08,159
that's great so you mentioned nitrogen

1280
00:46:05,358 --> 00:46:10,078
um it appears that cannabis prefers its

1281
00:46:08,159 --> 00:46:13,199
nitrogen in the form of nitrate

1282
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:14,560
for the most part what i'm seeing can

1283
00:46:13,199 --> 00:46:15,199
you talk a little bit about you said you

1284
00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:16,960
know

1285
00:46:15,199 --> 00:46:18,799
nitrogen the form of nitrogen and its

1286
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:22,800
importance

1287
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:25,039
yeah and um our formulas have

1288
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:26,000
some of them have all nitrate nitrogen

1289
00:46:25,039 --> 00:46:29,119
and some do

1290
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,760
have a slight amount of ammonium

1291
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:32,160
nitrogen

1292
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:34,480
in there too so the initial studies that

1293
00:46:32,159 --> 00:46:37,519
we found

1294
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:41,119
was that there is benefits from having

1295
00:46:37,519 --> 00:46:43,280
a mixture of an ammonium and nitrate

1296
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:45,599
source we don't have urea in

1297
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:46,800
any of our formulas whatsoever so that's

1298
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:49,519
just like an

1299
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:50,079
we don't use that source of nitrogen but

1300
00:46:49,519 --> 00:46:52,239
one of the

1301
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:53,920
cool things we saw was like at the clone

1302
00:46:52,239 --> 00:46:57,118
stage so in the beginning

1303
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:58,720
there was a lot of talk like oh for your

1304
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:00,960
clones or for your start

1305
00:46:58,719 --> 00:47:02,879
like taking this from seed just feed at

1306
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:04,400
a lower nitrogen concentration of a

1307
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,800
balanced fertilizer

1308
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:07,680
and you will you know be able to have a

1309
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:10,960
successful

1310
00:47:07,679 --> 00:47:14,159
clone clone stage and what we've found

1311
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:18,000
with our clone is a 15 617

1312
00:47:14,159 --> 00:47:21,279
it actually has a about a 20

1313
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:23,599
ammonium nitrogen um component

1314
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:26,000
and we found with the ratio of that

1315
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:28,720
product with the micros all together

1316
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,280
we were able to speed up root formation

1317
00:47:28,719 --> 00:47:33,519
and branching and

1318
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:37,359
establishment from a typical

1319
00:47:33,519 --> 00:47:40,079
you know 10 to 14 days to 7 to 10

1320
00:47:37,358 --> 00:47:42,078
and we found that the plants really

1321
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:44,318
thrived when we got that ratio of

1322
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:45,920
ammonium to nitrate correct

1323
00:47:44,318 --> 00:47:47,440
which was kind of neat to see because

1324
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:49,280
back then

1325
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,639
people just thought oh no just feed it

1326
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:53,680
lower strength

1327
00:47:50,639 --> 00:47:56,078
and everything will be good and and we

1328
00:47:53,679 --> 00:47:58,399
and also everyone also thought too oh

1329
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:59,920
you need a ton of phosphorus to start

1330
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:01,920
well that was not the case at all our

1331
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:05,599
formula for clones is a 15

1332
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:06,079
6 17. so it has it does not have that

1333
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:08,318
huge

1334
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:09,760
phosphorus number it has the right

1335
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:11,838
amount of phosphorus

1336
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:14,480
with the ratio of nitrogen to potassium

1337
00:48:11,838 --> 00:48:16,318
that makes things work

1338
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:18,400
yeah so what are folks typically using

1339
00:48:16,318 --> 00:48:21,838
for media with your fertilizers

1340
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:24,000
and then how are your plants finishing

1341
00:48:21,838 --> 00:48:25,039
in terms of the ec levels in the media

1342
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,880
as well as

1343
00:48:25,039 --> 00:48:31,599
the look of the plant i guess

1344
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:32,720
yeah people use all different media i

1345
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:34,720
mean

1346
00:48:32,719 --> 00:48:37,039
in the beginning it was just like it

1347
00:48:34,719 --> 00:48:40,000
seemed like everyone was using cocoa

1348
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:42,719
we have a lot of a lot of growers that

1349
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:45,920
do grow in rock wool and those types of

1350
00:48:42,719 --> 00:48:48,719
inert medias and then

1351
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:50,079
obviously you know soilless mix the

1352
00:48:48,719 --> 00:48:52,719
versions of that

1353
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:54,400
come on in and and people make their own

1354
00:48:52,719 --> 00:48:56,480
mixtures doing all these different

1355
00:48:54,400 --> 00:49:00,318
things too so the media can be

1356
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:01,760
several varieties of things and then we

1357
00:49:00,318 --> 00:49:03,519
a lot of times when we set people up

1358
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:05,280
with programs we look at their water

1359
00:49:03,519 --> 00:49:06,800
and then also consider the media

1360
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:10,880
characteristics

1361
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:12,640
in order to start with a

1362
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:14,480
concentration that would be right for

1363
00:49:12,639 --> 00:49:16,799
their growth so if you check

1364
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:18,400
on the website you'll see all these grow

1365
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,920
schedules which are which are really

1366
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:22,639
cool and

1367
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:23,599
it gives you a great place to start with

1368
00:49:22,639 --> 00:49:27,039
jax because

1369
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:29,200
it will kind of identify the nutrient

1370
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:30,639
concentrations that like you said aren't

1371
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:31,519
too much you know and you're not

1372
00:49:30,639 --> 00:49:34,239
overdoing it

1373
00:49:31,519 --> 00:49:35,838
it's never what what did someone say to

1374
00:49:34,239 --> 00:49:38,078
me the other day they were like

1375
00:49:35,838 --> 00:49:39,920
oh well i was mixing your fertilizer and

1376
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:42,079
i didn't think it was blue enough so i

1377
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:43,680
add some added some more i'm like oh my

1378
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:47,039
gosh

1379
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:49,838
that is not how you test the ec

1380
00:49:47,039 --> 00:49:51,358
or strength of fertilizer and you don't

1381
00:49:49,838 --> 00:49:54,480
have to run into that with your

1382
00:49:51,358 --> 00:49:55,119
organic side of it tad right oh all the

1383
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:57,119
time

1384
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:58,880
people i mean not so much the color but

1385
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:00,800
people are like oh my buddy said i

1386
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:02,640
should use bat guano so i added a bunch

1387
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:04,880
of baguano or you know whatever

1388
00:50:02,639 --> 00:50:06,239
that thing is and you're like no i you

1389
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,599
know there's plenty of phosphorous

1390
00:50:06,239 --> 00:50:10,959
already you don't need more pee

1391
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:12,480
you know kind of thing but right and

1392
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:13,920
growers want to tinker you know that's

1393
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:15,199
that's part of growing is you feel like

1394
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:18,079
you have to be doing something and

1395
00:50:15,199 --> 00:50:19,838
sometimes that gets carried away

1396
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:21,839
a hundred percent and you see that with

1397
00:50:19,838 --> 00:50:23,519
our formulas too that's why we kind of

1398
00:50:21,838 --> 00:50:25,519
put those growth schedules out there

1399
00:50:23,519 --> 00:50:26,239
because it gave everyone kind of a place

1400
00:50:25,519 --> 00:50:29,440
to start

1401
00:50:26,239 --> 00:50:30,479
tinkering you know and one of the useful

1402
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:33,440
things is too when

1403
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:35,599
when you're saying with ec because again

1404
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:37,358
recs are very different than other

1405
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:40,559
companies are because of the

1406
00:50:37,358 --> 00:50:42,480
purity of the raw materials so a lot of

1407
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:45,599
times people will say oh my gosh

1408
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:46,960
you know that's that's not that's that

1409
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:50,559
can't be right you can't

1410
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:52,480
you know grow a crop with these ecs and

1411
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:54,880
you know we're like no that's it's

1412
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:55,920
measured to be exactly that way you have

1413
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:57,838
to add in your

1414
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:59,599
you know obviously the ec of the water

1415
00:50:57,838 --> 00:51:00,799
that you're starting with but this is

1416
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:04,720
all you really need

1417
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:06,720
to deliver those nutrients um and then

1418
00:51:04,719 --> 00:51:08,558
you'll also see people kind of tinkering

1419
00:51:06,719 --> 00:51:11,039
around with their like

1420
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:13,119
watering practices so you'll see

1421
00:51:11,039 --> 00:51:16,358
different growers leaching

1422
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:19,200
um you know and and others not and and

1423
00:51:16,358 --> 00:51:22,400
recirculating systems and stuff so

1424
00:51:19,199 --> 00:51:25,919
at the end of the crop cycle we

1425
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:27,680
do tend to see ec levels

1426
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:29,838
increasing because especially our

1427
00:51:27,679 --> 00:51:32,078
finished formula does have a higher

1428
00:51:29,838 --> 00:51:32,880
overall ec when you're only feeding at

1429
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:35,839
100

1430
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:38,640
parts per million of nitrogen but we do

1431
00:51:35,838 --> 00:51:42,960
recommend a four to seven day flush

1432
00:51:38,639 --> 00:51:45,598
in most growing environments

1433
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:47,199
right before harvest i did want to talk

1434
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:50,318
about that actually because

1435
00:51:47,199 --> 00:51:52,078
this is something that well one person

1436
00:51:50,318 --> 00:51:55,039
got really upset with me on

1437
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:56,240
on apple podcast because i said uh you

1438
00:51:55,039 --> 00:51:58,000
know we don't really flush it with

1439
00:51:56,239 --> 00:51:58,879
organic soils because the nutrients

1440
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,039
aren't

1441
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:03,119
for the most part aren't in a form they

1442
00:52:01,039 --> 00:52:05,838
can be removed from the soil

1443
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:07,599
easily i mean if you i guess have too

1444
00:52:05,838 --> 00:52:08,960
much nitrates or sodium things like that

1445
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:09,359
you could flush out but for the most

1446
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:12,400
part

1447
00:52:09,358 --> 00:52:14,400
it it's not the same as growing

1448
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:16,318
you know with mineral salts but i'd love

1449
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:19,039
to hear your thoughts on this and if

1450
00:52:16,318 --> 00:52:20,318
if you are let's just say in a

1451
00:52:19,039 --> 00:52:22,318
hypothetically

1452
00:52:20,318 --> 00:52:24,719
if you've got a perfectly dialed in

1453
00:52:22,318 --> 00:52:27,838
system in theory i wouldn't think that

1454
00:52:24,719 --> 00:52:31,039
there would be a lot to flesh out

1455
00:52:27,838 --> 00:52:34,400
i agree with you and we constantly

1456
00:52:31,039 --> 00:52:36,719
in like our internal discussions

1457
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:37,920
talk about this okay because you're

1458
00:52:36,719 --> 00:52:40,799
exactly right we're

1459
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:41,760
we are suggesting feeding constant

1460
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:44,880
liquid feed

1461
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:47,520
at this conservative lower

1462
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:48,880
end rate to really just kind of make

1463
00:52:47,519 --> 00:52:51,039
sure you're

1464
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:52,880
giving enough to the plant we're also

1465
00:52:51,039 --> 00:52:54,400
suggesting testing the plants through

1466
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:57,920
the crop cycle so you can

1467
00:52:54,400 --> 00:53:00,079
really dial in where your nutrient

1468
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:03,680
concentration is both at the root zone

1469
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:06,720
and in the plant tissue so

1470
00:53:03,679 --> 00:53:09,838
you shouldn't have to

1471
00:53:06,719 --> 00:53:11,919
flush at all however we have found

1472
00:53:09,838 --> 00:53:13,519
through multiple growers and people that

1473
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:15,358
worked with

1474
00:53:13,519 --> 00:53:17,039
our products and other products and it

1475
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:20,078
just seems like

1476
00:53:17,039 --> 00:53:21,759
this is something that is is part of the

1477
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:25,519
culture here growing cannabis

1478
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:28,559
is that they feel that you know a flush

1479
00:53:25,519 --> 00:53:30,400
increases the you know the

1480
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:31,680
beneficial characteristics of the end

1481
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:34,000
product so

1482
00:53:31,679 --> 00:53:35,440
i've heard people say oh well i make

1483
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,159
sure i flush so i

1484
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:40,159
so you know you know when i either

1485
00:53:38,159 --> 00:53:43,440
mostly smoke it it doesn't

1486
00:53:40,159 --> 00:53:45,039
seem so harsh i honestly that's personal

1487
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:47,519
preference i really don't

1488
00:53:45,039 --> 00:53:49,279
you know think that that's a we haven't

1489
00:53:47,519 --> 00:53:50,960
been able to show that that's a function

1490
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:52,319
of the nutrients being flushed out of

1491
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:55,039
the system but that's what's

1492
00:53:52,318 --> 00:53:55,358
attributed to quite a bit but you're

1493
00:53:55,039 --> 00:53:59,838
right

1494
00:53:55,358 --> 00:53:59,838
if it's a if it's a system that is

1495
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:04,720
exhibiting the nutrient concentrations

1496
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:08,558
perfectly for plant health and yield

1497
00:54:04,719 --> 00:54:10,318
you shouldn't have to flush at all

1498
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:11,920
has anyone done research where they've

1499
00:54:10,318 --> 00:54:14,159
done tissue testing

1500
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:16,639
on plants that have been flushed versus

1501
00:54:14,159 --> 00:54:19,358
not flushed we know with low ec

1502
00:54:16,639 --> 00:54:19,759
in the media to show that there actually

1503
00:54:19,358 --> 00:54:23,279
is

1504
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:24,079
less a mineral accumulation in the

1505
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:26,000
tissue

1506
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:29,200
to where when you did smoke it it would

1507
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:31,920
be less you know quote unquote harsh

1508
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:33,679
i mean we've done our own versions of

1509
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:35,358
trials in multiple different like

1510
00:54:33,679 --> 00:54:38,399
growing environments like outside

1511
00:54:35,358 --> 00:54:39,598
inside you know closed system open

1512
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:42,798
system

1513
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:45,280
and the data just isn't

1514
00:54:42,798 --> 00:54:46,960
clear you know there's nothing to say

1515
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:49,040
this is the best way

1516
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:50,798
and that's where i think possibly as

1517
00:54:49,039 --> 00:54:53,358
these universities

1518
00:54:50,798 --> 00:54:55,599
do set up these environments where they

1519
00:54:53,358 --> 00:54:56,960
can really dial in on specifics that

1520
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:58,160
would be something that would be super

1521
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:00,798
interesting

1522
00:54:58,159 --> 00:55:01,679
to know because it is a ton of personal

1523
00:55:00,798 --> 00:55:05,039
preference

1524
00:55:01,679 --> 00:55:06,318
too and and varietal and cultivar

1525
00:55:05,039 --> 00:55:08,719
specific

1526
00:55:06,318 --> 00:55:09,599
which is makes it even more difficult

1527
00:55:08,719 --> 00:55:10,719
you know

1528
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:12,880
yeah and we hadn't even talked about

1529
00:55:10,719 --> 00:55:16,078
plant stress and had that impact on

1530
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:17,680
terpene expression or thc production

1531
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:19,119
which is obviously a role too like

1532
00:55:17,679 --> 00:55:20,960
possibly these flushes

1533
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:22,480
at the end you know create more plant

1534
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:24,720
stress uh

1535
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:26,240
do the water saturation saturation you

1536
00:55:24,719 --> 00:55:28,239
know affecting the root hairs maybe

1537
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:31,118
causing the plant to

1538
00:55:28,239 --> 00:55:33,598
produce more you know terpenes or

1539
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:35,039
cannabinoids things like that so

1540
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:37,119
that's something interesting too in

1541
00:55:35,039 --> 00:55:38,318
terms of targeted plant stress that i

1542
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:39,200
haven't seen a lot of research with

1543
00:55:38,318 --> 00:55:42,719
cannabis on

1544
00:55:39,199 --> 00:55:43,358
but uh no a lot of it has to be coming

1545
00:55:42,719 --> 00:55:45,759
now

1546
00:55:43,358 --> 00:55:46,480
it's exciting i think we're in a very

1547
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:49,200
exciting

1548
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:50,318
stage to be and i think anyone like in

1549
00:55:49,199 --> 00:55:53,919
the

1550
00:55:50,318 --> 00:55:56,400
in in in this cool environment

1551
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:57,680
is ready to learn i mean and that's what

1552
00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:00,960
i was talking to

1553
00:55:57,679 --> 00:56:03,039
earlier about you know horticulture is

1554
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:05,519
a community of people that are just

1555
00:56:03,039 --> 00:56:06,798
starving for knowledge and you and it is

1556
00:56:05,519 --> 00:56:08,318
plants and

1557
00:56:06,798 --> 00:56:10,400
you know you think you know something

1558
00:56:08,318 --> 00:56:11,358
about a plant and then just spending

1559
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:13,519
time with it and

1560
00:56:11,358 --> 00:56:15,920
watching it and manipulating certain

1561
00:56:13,519 --> 00:56:17,199
things you always are in a great state

1562
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:18,798
to learn more

1563
00:56:17,199 --> 00:56:21,039
and i think and that's what i'm so

1564
00:56:18,798 --> 00:56:22,639
excited about with jax for

1565
00:56:21,039 --> 00:56:24,159
just doing what we're doing on the

1566
00:56:22,639 --> 00:56:25,118
everyday you know blending water

1567
00:56:24,159 --> 00:56:27,759
solubles

1568
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:28,559
but also working with growers to try and

1569
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:31,440
you know help

1570
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:32,240
them you know reach their most optimum

1571
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:33,838
for their

1572
00:56:32,239 --> 00:56:35,358
growing environment even if it's a

1573
00:56:33,838 --> 00:56:38,639
combination of

1574
00:56:35,358 --> 00:56:40,719
you know uh living soil or organics or

1575
00:56:38,639 --> 00:56:41,118
different amendments and biostimulants

1576
00:56:40,719 --> 00:56:44,318
it's

1577
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:46,480
so fun and i'm i'm i feel

1578
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:48,639
thankful to be in this industry at this

1579
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:51,358
time you know

1580
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:52,719
oh totally me too i mean how many

1581
00:56:51,358 --> 00:56:53,279
opportunities do you have in a lifetime

1582
00:56:52,719 --> 00:56:55,838
to work

1583
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:56,720
on a plant that you can actually do

1584
00:56:55,838 --> 00:56:59,358
research on

1585
00:56:56,719 --> 00:56:59,838
that's impactful i mean you talk about

1586
00:56:59,358 --> 00:57:02,639
corn

1587
00:56:59,838 --> 00:57:04,159
you know or some of these you know crops

1588
00:57:02,639 --> 00:57:04,719
there's so much research that's already

1589
00:57:04,159 --> 00:57:06,798
been done

1590
00:57:04,719 --> 00:57:08,318
it's like what's new to really try

1591
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:12,000
whereas with cannabis it's

1592
00:57:08,318 --> 00:57:13,358
a blank slate and i love that yeah and

1593
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,639
that's what's neat about it like the

1594
00:57:13,358 --> 00:57:17,279
mineral side

1595
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:18,798
we're trying as much as possible to

1596
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:22,240
provide

1597
00:57:18,798 --> 00:57:26,000
pure you know as pure and and

1598
00:57:22,239 --> 00:57:28,399
and high quality water soluble um

1599
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,119
blends as possible so that people when

1600
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:31,920
they

1601
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:32,640
you know whatever they're trying to do

1602
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:34,559
you know and

1603
00:57:32,639 --> 00:57:36,000
and grow the crops they know that if

1604
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:38,319
they come and they see something with

1605
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:40,318
jax on it there's research behind here

1606
00:57:38,318 --> 00:57:43,679
this is science science-based

1607
00:57:40,318 --> 00:57:45,358
knowledge and that's what you know you

1608
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:47,759
see a lot of these other

1609
00:57:45,358 --> 00:57:48,880
companies out there you know doing this

1610
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:51,920
that and the other and

1611
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:52,720
driving around cars with blah blah blah

1612
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:54,880
anyway but

1613
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:55,919
this this is where we need to get for

1614
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:58,720
our community

1615
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:59,440
right so we can all benefit from science

1616
00:57:58,719 --> 00:58:02,558
factual

1617
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:04,880
knowledge you know like i said i'm a

1618
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:06,880
hardcore organic guy but if we can move

1619
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:10,000
away from bottled nutrients

1620
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:11,838
you know even just these powdered

1621
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,119
formulations to me that's a win because

1622
00:58:11,838 --> 00:58:14,400
i realize that not everyone's going to

1623
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:17,680
go organic

1624
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:20,400
and uh you know while that may be my own

1625
00:58:17,679 --> 00:58:21,598
life path uh there are reasons that

1626
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:23,039
people choose to grow with mineral

1627
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:23,760
assaults and if they're going to do it

1628
00:58:23,039 --> 00:58:25,679
like apply

1629
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:27,040
science use the information that's out

1630
00:58:25,679 --> 00:58:28,078
there and go with products that are

1631
00:58:27,039 --> 00:58:31,119
going to be safer

1632
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:34,079
and purer and more concentrated

1633
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:35,358
um that you listed yeah totally you know

1634
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:37,119
and cost effectively you're not

1635
00:58:35,358 --> 00:58:38,798
shipping right you're not shipping

1636
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:42,079
things all over you know

1637
00:58:38,798 --> 00:58:45,039
a truck full of water it truly is a

1638
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:46,318
a ratio of an efficient formula to

1639
00:58:45,039 --> 00:58:48,480
deliver

1640
00:58:46,318 --> 00:58:49,519
you know the concentration that that you

1641
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:52,159
need

1642
00:58:49,519 --> 00:58:52,960
and it isn't like all this other bs

1643
00:58:52,159 --> 00:58:56,159
involved

1644
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:57,760
you know so i want to you know i'd be

1645
00:58:56,159 --> 00:58:58,798
remiss if i didn't focus a little bit

1646
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:01,839
more on water

1647
00:58:58,798 --> 00:59:03,440
because we're seeing um we're seeing

1648
00:59:01,838 --> 00:59:05,440
some challenges on the organic side with

1649
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:07,358
people who are using ro water

1650
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:08,559
in regards to possibly heavy metal

1651
00:59:07,358 --> 00:59:11,759
uptake

1652
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:14,559
as well as just how water impacts

1653
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:16,319
nutrients and you know obviously have

1654
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:17,119
different formulations based on water

1655
00:59:16,318 --> 00:59:18,639
quality

1656
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:20,318
can you talk about what you're looking

1657
00:59:18,639 --> 00:59:22,159
at when it comes to water i know that's

1658
00:59:20,318 --> 00:59:25,199
kind of a big topic

1659
00:59:22,159 --> 00:59:27,920
but specifically um you know i know

1660
00:59:25,199 --> 00:59:28,879
rl wants to to buffer but how do we how

1661
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:32,159
do we accommodate

1662
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:34,480
you know water and and

1663
00:59:32,159 --> 00:59:36,798
and ph and these factors into our

1664
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:38,960
growing systems

1665
00:59:36,798 --> 00:59:40,400
oh and and we spend a lot of time on

1666
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:42,880
this just

1667
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:44,400
on this is really the most important

1668
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:46,318
thing when we talk about

1669
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:47,760
what we deal with at jacks every day i

1670
00:59:46,318 --> 00:59:50,719
mean our laboratory

1671
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:51,760
on site we probably have you know 50 to

1672
00:59:50,719 --> 00:59:53,838
100 different

1673
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:54,960
what people sending us water samples in

1674
00:59:53,838 --> 00:59:58,318
a day

1675
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:59,358
um on on a flow day just trying to take

1676
00:59:58,318 --> 01:00:01,838
a look at

1677
00:59:59,358 --> 01:00:02,480
build their baseline to understand what

1678
01:00:01,838 --> 01:00:05,279
important

1679
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:06,880
nutrient qualities are in their water

1680
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:08,000
when i look at a water source especially

1681
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:12,318
when i'm matching

1682
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:15,519
nutrition to it is i look at the ph

1683
01:00:12,318 --> 01:00:17,440
the alkalinity which obviously is a

1684
01:00:15,519 --> 01:00:18,559
a measure of the buffering capacity of

1685
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:21,599
the water

1686
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:24,720
um and then also a few

1687
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:26,720
of the secondary elements mostly calcium

1688
01:00:24,719 --> 01:00:29,919
magnesium and sulfur

1689
01:00:26,719 --> 01:00:30,798
to see you know what that buffering

1690
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:33,920
capacity

1691
01:00:30,798 --> 01:00:36,318
or water alkalinity is from

1692
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:37,039
is it from something good or something

1693
01:00:36,318 --> 01:00:39,039
bad

1694
01:00:37,039 --> 01:00:40,798
and then uh the bad things that you

1695
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:41,279
don't want to see in your water is a lot

1696
01:00:40,798 --> 01:00:44,400
of

1697
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:44,960
sodium and chloride so we're looking at

1698
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:47,358
those

1699
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:48,159
elements just a quick and dirty glance

1700
01:00:47,358 --> 01:00:50,558
and you can tell

1701
01:00:48,159 --> 01:00:52,798
right off the bat if this is a good

1702
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:54,960
water source that's going to help you

1703
01:00:52,798 --> 01:00:57,039
or another type of water source where

1704
01:00:54,960 --> 01:01:00,720
you're going to have to make some

1705
01:00:57,039 --> 01:01:04,000
choices to make to balance

1706
01:01:00,719 --> 01:01:04,639
nutrients correctly for optimum you know

1707
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,599
plant

1708
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:07,598
nutrient uptake

1709
01:01:07,679 --> 01:01:13,039
now i know you can formulate around ro

1710
01:01:10,798 --> 01:01:15,119
pretty easily

1711
01:01:13,039 --> 01:01:17,119
on a chemical side but for those of us

1712
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:19,119
on the organic side

1713
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:20,720
there's some more challenges i mean i

1714
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:22,079
know you have a little more chemistry

1715
01:01:20,719 --> 01:01:23,519
background than i do

1716
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:25,359
i want to get a chemist on the show

1717
01:01:23,519 --> 01:01:26,880
specifically to talk about water and

1718
01:01:25,358 --> 01:01:28,960
heavy metals

1719
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:31,039
but uh yeah is there anything you can

1720
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:34,318
share along those lines in terms of

1721
01:01:31,039 --> 01:01:37,599
you know using rl water in

1722
01:01:34,318 --> 01:01:40,639
an organic media in terms of some of the

1723
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:44,559
the challenges around that

1724
01:01:40,639 --> 01:01:46,960
yeah i mean ro is a

1725
01:01:44,559 --> 01:01:48,880
is a tough it's not a tough topic

1726
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:51,039
because it really

1727
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:52,000
you know in in a lot of times when i'm

1728
01:01:51,039 --> 01:01:55,279
talking to growers

1729
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:57,519
that are like i would like to start

1730
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:58,480
you know growing cannabis or growing

1731
01:01:57,519 --> 01:02:01,920
hemp

1732
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:03,440
and they don't have anything figured out

1733
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:06,079
yet they don't know if they want to

1734
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:07,519
try an organic pathway they don't know

1735
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:09,519
you know what their water is like

1736
01:02:07,519 --> 01:02:10,719
they don't know how they're even going

1737
01:02:09,519 --> 01:02:14,239
to set up their

1738
01:02:10,719 --> 01:02:16,480
their site it's great to get

1739
01:02:14,239 --> 01:02:19,038
people at that stage because you can

1740
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:22,719
really make some good decisions and

1741
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:25,200
ro water is useful in that it takes out

1742
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:26,399
all of the potential bad that could come

1743
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:29,199
from a water source

1744
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:30,559
right so you know too high sodium too

1745
01:02:29,199 --> 01:02:35,199
high chloride

1746
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:39,280
um the boron is too high or the iron

1747
01:02:35,199 --> 01:02:39,679
whatever but when in doing that you

1748
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:42,319
really

1749
01:02:39,679 --> 01:02:43,838
lose the good things that also come from

1750
01:02:42,318 --> 01:02:45,358
water sources

1751
01:02:43,838 --> 01:02:47,119
so if you're working with a grower

1752
01:02:45,358 --> 01:02:50,798
especially in an organic

1753
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:53,920
setting where they you know are using ro

1754
01:02:50,798 --> 01:02:56,880
my first thought for organic or

1755
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:58,079
mineral side is that that grower needs

1756
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:01,200
to understand that

1757
01:02:58,079 --> 01:03:04,559
every time they deliver water to their

1758
01:03:01,199 --> 01:03:05,118
you know plant they need to also make

1759
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:08,319
sure

1760
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:09,440
that they're building a solution in the

1761
01:03:08,318 --> 01:03:12,719
root zone

1762
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:15,358
that has all of the essential

1763
01:03:12,719 --> 01:03:16,239
elements that the plant needs for uptake

1764
01:03:15,358 --> 01:03:18,798
so

1765
01:03:16,239 --> 01:03:20,399
in an organic setting making sure that

1766
01:03:18,798 --> 01:03:23,280
you have those sources of

1767
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:25,519
secondary and micronutrients that are

1768
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:27,920
not only immediately available

1769
01:03:25,519 --> 01:03:29,280
but are you know slowly available so

1770
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:32,079
they're always

1771
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:32,880
there as a source is important for a

1772
01:03:32,079 --> 01:03:36,000
grower that

1773
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:39,280
is using an ro source it's not

1774
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:42,559
as important if you have a really great

1775
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:44,240
well where you already have a nice ratio

1776
01:03:42,559 --> 01:03:46,880
of calcium to magnesium

1777
01:03:44,239 --> 01:03:49,358
some sulfur some microbes in there it

1778
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:52,480
kind of takes some of the pressure off

1779
01:03:49,358 --> 01:03:54,159
but ro you know really kicks it up to

1780
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:55,199
that next level where you have to

1781
01:03:54,159 --> 01:03:57,519
remember

1782
01:03:55,199 --> 01:04:01,439
at all times you have to provide these

1783
01:03:57,519 --> 01:04:01,440
essential nutrients for plant uptake

1784
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:06,480
yeah now what about the fact that ro you

1785
01:04:04,719 --> 01:04:07,838
know it's it wants to bond with

1786
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:09,920
water wants to bond with something it

1787
01:04:07,838 --> 01:04:10,880
doesn't like surviving in a vacuum like

1788
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:13,358
that so

1789
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:15,200
um you know we are like for example i

1790
01:04:13,358 --> 01:04:18,318
had a i had a grower using

1791
01:04:15,199 --> 01:04:20,318
these uh galvanized steaks and they they

1792
01:04:18,318 --> 01:04:22,480
were stripped pretty quickly

1793
01:04:20,318 --> 01:04:23,519
um right from from watering with ro

1794
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:25,599
water um

1795
01:04:23,519 --> 01:04:27,519
well i guess any water would eventually

1796
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:29,440
do it but

1797
01:04:27,519 --> 01:04:32,318
you know we were concerned possibly that

1798
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:35,119
might lead to higher heavy metal content

1799
01:04:32,318 --> 01:04:37,199
how does ro water or water in general

1800
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:39,680
interact with

1801
01:04:37,199 --> 01:04:40,879
heavy metals i know ph plays a big role

1802
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:42,239
which we haven't really talked about in

1803
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:45,519
terms of uptake

1804
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:46,879
but um can you touch on the water aspect

1805
01:04:45,519 --> 01:04:50,239
there

1806
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:53,920
yes of course so you know

1807
01:04:50,239 --> 01:04:54,959
certain things um all nutrients really

1808
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:57,599
are

1809
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:58,318
more more or less available according to

1810
01:04:57,599 --> 01:05:01,280
the ph

1811
01:04:58,318 --> 01:05:03,440
that is in the nutrient solution so in

1812
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:04,559
most cases for micronutrients the more

1813
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:07,679
acidic

1814
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:11,200
of a ph of soil solution or soil collet

1815
01:05:07,679 --> 01:05:13,519
environment the more available those

1816
01:05:11,199 --> 01:05:14,639
ions will be for the plant to be able to

1817
01:05:13,519 --> 01:05:17,038
take them up

1818
01:05:14,639 --> 01:05:18,798
and then the other way around too as the

1819
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:22,880
ph gets above

1820
01:05:18,798 --> 01:05:26,639
mostly like six two six five you'll see

1821
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:28,960
a pretty sharp decrease in how

1822
01:05:26,639 --> 01:05:31,038
certain nutrients are available for

1823
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:34,318
plant uptake

1824
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:37,039
ro not having any you know

1825
01:05:34,318 --> 01:05:37,920
any charge associated with it is

1826
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:41,920
constantly

1827
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:45,119
looking to balance itself by stealing

1828
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:47,440
um you know one or two you know negative

1829
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:51,599
or positive charges to kind of make it

1830
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:55,440
make itself get to equilibrium

1831
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:57,519
so it's just very interesting because

1832
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:58,559
what you have available in your soil

1833
01:05:57,519 --> 01:06:02,480
solution or

1834
01:05:58,559 --> 01:06:06,640
in your soil environment will interact

1835
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:08,880
back and forth with your water source um

1836
01:06:06,639 --> 01:06:10,480
so i i'm trying to think like now i

1837
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:12,400
forgot what your question was

1838
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:14,960
pad so you'll have to remind me but am i

1839
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:17,440
going on the right path

1840
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:19,519
yeah i'm just wondering how you know say

1841
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:22,720
water that is

1842
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:24,960
you know well water versus ro water you

1843
01:06:22,719 --> 01:06:27,199
know water that has minerals in it

1844
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:28,639
um what what differences might we expect

1845
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:32,078
in a soil

1846
01:06:28,639 --> 01:06:36,159
media or soilless media in terms of uh

1847
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:38,640
heavy metal uptake or other effects

1848
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:40,558
you know with a buffered water versus

1849
01:06:38,639 --> 01:06:43,838
you know unbuffered water i guess is

1850
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:46,240
my question i think the main

1851
01:06:43,838 --> 01:06:48,480
thing to be concerned about is the ph

1852
01:06:46,239 --> 01:06:49,279
and and the buffering because that does

1853
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:52,400
have a

1854
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:56,480
you know uh effect on on

1855
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:59,200
ph swings in in the water source

1856
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:59,679
if you have a completely pure water

1857
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:03,038
source

1858
01:06:59,679 --> 01:07:06,159
that living at a ph that is

1859
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:09,119
in the mid to low fives almost

1860
01:07:06,159 --> 01:07:11,440
anything including micronutrients and

1861
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:14,079
heavy metals are going to have

1862
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:14,720
just tend to be more available and

1863
01:07:14,079 --> 01:07:17,119
soluble

1864
01:07:14,719 --> 01:07:19,759
in that environment so if you're using

1865
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:22,720
an ro water

1866
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:24,799
in most cases and with the use of a lot

1867
01:07:22,719 --> 01:07:28,879
of the fertilizers that we have

1868
01:07:24,798 --> 01:07:32,079
we try to keep the ph

1869
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:34,960
between six of eight and six

1870
01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:35,519
two in order to keep that perfect kind

1871
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:37,760
of like

1872
01:07:35,519 --> 01:07:39,358
mostly available but not too available

1873
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:42,880
on the acidic side or not

1874
01:07:39,358 --> 01:07:46,480
unavailable at the basic side so that

1875
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:48,960
we can you know just allow a perfect

1876
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:50,960
ram of what's available but if you're

1877
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:52,079
using any water source and it's living

1878
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:53,838
at a ph where thing

1879
01:07:52,079 --> 01:07:55,680
where it makes things more available

1880
01:07:53,838 --> 01:07:58,798
you're going to see increased uptake

1881
01:07:55,679 --> 01:08:01,199
of heavy metals or otherwise so ph and

1882
01:07:58,798 --> 01:08:02,880
alkalinity of the water source is most

1883
01:08:01,199 --> 01:08:04,558
important

1884
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:06,880
no matter where you're getting your

1885
01:08:04,559 --> 01:08:12,079
water from

1886
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:13,599
that makes sense yeah um

1887
01:08:12,079 --> 01:08:15,039
i you know those were my main questions

1888
01:08:13,599 --> 01:08:16,239
for you today was there anything else

1889
01:08:15,039 --> 01:08:19,119
you wanted to

1890
01:08:16,238 --> 01:08:19,119
talk about or add

1891
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:24,000
no i feel like i don't know we got to

1892
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:26,960
talk about a lot of fun things i hope

1893
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:28,079
that you know we can continue our

1894
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:31,198
relationship i'm

1895
01:08:28,079 --> 01:08:33,838
super happy to be asked to be on your um

1896
01:08:31,198 --> 01:08:35,838
podcast thank you so much and i think

1897
01:08:33,838 --> 01:08:39,439
this is what the future of

1898
01:08:35,838 --> 01:08:40,318
our industry needs to always consider

1899
01:08:39,439 --> 01:08:43,599
there's

1900
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:45,359
people with knowledge on their little

1901
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:49,199
sector of things like

1902
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:51,279
i'm like a mineral you know what i mean

1903
01:08:49,198 --> 01:08:53,678
so that's what i do on the day-to-day

1904
01:08:51,279 --> 01:08:55,279
but conversations like this that you're

1905
01:08:53,679 --> 01:08:57,119
especially through your podcast you're

1906
01:08:55,279 --> 01:08:58,640
able to bring people together

1907
01:08:57,119 --> 01:09:00,399
i think it's only going to benefit our

1908
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:02,239
industry so i

1909
01:09:00,399 --> 01:09:04,719
applaud you and thank you so much for

1910

1916
01:09:14,798 --> 01:09:21,920
yeah we uh we at jax are trying to

1917
01:09:18,399 --> 01:09:24,000
help answer some of these like basic

1918
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:25,600
plant nutrition on the mineral side

1919
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,479
questions so we've been doing all these

1920
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:30,000
little like get

1921
01:09:26,479 --> 01:09:33,919
technical videos so

1922
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:35,838
any suggestions what you're kind of um

1923
