welcome to the Cannabis cultivation and

3
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:28,719
science podcast I'm your host Tad hussy

4
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:30,278
of Kiss Organics this is the podcast

5
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:32,199
where we discuss the cutting edge of

6
00:00:30,278 --> 00:00:33,920
growing from a science-based perspective

7
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,359
and drawn top experts from around the

8
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,600
industry to share their wisdom and

9
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:40,039
knowledge my podcast this week is with

10
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,600
Virginia Emery Virginia is the founder

11
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:44,000
and CEO of beta hatch a pioneering

12
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,280
insect farming company that is

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,159
industrializing insects for agriculture

14
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,759
beta hatch is fueled by a passion to see

15
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:51,799
insects reach their true potential in

16
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:53,479
our food systems the company has grown

17
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:55,479
to be internationally recognized for its

18
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:57,358
scientific approach to scaling insect

19
00:00:55,479 --> 00:00:59,319
production and operates North America's

20
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:01,800
largest mealworm farm for animal feed

21
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,399
production in Washington Virginia is the

22
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:05,399
country's most Innovative insect

23
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:08,478
entrepreneur recently recognized as a

24
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,640
Visionary Grist 50 fixer Virginia has a

25
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:12,799
PHD in entomology from the University of

26
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,560
California Berkeley and has been awarded

27
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,200
over 20 grants and honors and is

28
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,159
published on subjects ranging from

29
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,439
chemical communication to genetics to

30
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:23,400
insect Behavior her life's mission is to

31
00:01:20,438 --> 00:01:25,359
breed a bug that tastes like bacon some

32
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,200
highlights of frass use in relation to

33
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:30,039
cannabis production are the following

34
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,359
it's a clean product ideal for indoor

35
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,240
growing because their insects are

36
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:35,280
growing indoors in climate controlled

37
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:37,560
conditions on organic feed there is no

38
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,799
risk of pests heavy metals pesticides

39
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,879
herbicides or fungicides coming into the

40
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:43,600
greenhouse uh it's a highly soluble

41
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:45,359
source of nitrogen immediately available

42
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:47,959
to plants their Studies have shown

43
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:50,078
increases in leafing and fruiting unlike

44
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:51,759
a conventional mineral fertilizer fras

45
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:53,879
contains small concentrations of

46
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,599
micronutrients like copper zinc and

47
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:58,519
manganese studies suggests the addition

48
00:01:56,599 --> 00:02:00,158
of frass stimulates soil microbial

49
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:02,200
activity especially when it is mixed

50
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:05,439
with mineral fertilizer suggesting a

51
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:07,118
synergistic effect between both uh taken

52
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:08,639
together results indicate that fras has

53
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:10,159
a great potential to be used as a

54
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,958
partial or complete substitute for

55
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:14,759
mineral NPK fertilizer their frass is

56
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,479
produced locally in Washington state in

57
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:20,639
a zero waste system and is omry and USDA

58
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:22,759
certified organic now on to the

59
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:26,279
show hey Virginia thanks for coming on

60
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:29,280
the show today thank you for having me

61
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:32,919
yeah I'm excited to learn more about uh

62
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:35,159
insect grass and uh insect rearing and

63
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:37,119
production can we start off though by

64
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:37,919
telling uh listeners a little bit about

65
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,480
your

66
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:44,679
background yeah sure so I am an

67
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:47,719
entomologist by training so I'm a bug

68
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:50,879
expert uh they call me the bug lady in

69
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:52,759
Seattle where I've been um sharing my

70
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:54,878
business for a couple of years uh my

71
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:58,639
company is beta hatch and we Farm

72
00:02:54,878 --> 00:03:01,359
insects as a sustainable protein um and

73
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:03,958
one of the Great um co-products of our

74
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:07,799
process is fras fras is the word of the

75
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:10,319
day today it's uh the technical term for

76
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:13,439
insect poop so we have a saying at beta

77
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:14,839
hatch that frass happens um and the

78
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:17,318
company's been a couple years under

79
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:19,080
development I started working on this in

80
00:03:17,318 --> 00:03:22,280
2015 and we've been operating

81
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:24,879
commercially for about four years um you

82
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,759
know I got started with the business uh

83
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:29,438
because as an entomologist you know

84
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:32,039
about 99% of what you work on is how to

85
00:03:29,438 --> 00:03:34,639
kill bugs we kind of have this very

86
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:36,759
antagonistic relationship with insects

87
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:39,559
and it it's really leaving a lot on the

88
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:42,158
table I mean bugs do incredible things

89
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,438
as far as ecosystem services for us um

90
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:46,239
and everyone's very familiar with

91
00:03:43,438 --> 00:03:50,120
pollination but you know organic waste

92
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:52,280
recycling and nutrition is an area that

93
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,360
we we see a lot of missed opportunities

94
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,959
and so that's what beta hatch has been

95
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,280
working on is just making sure that

96
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:01,519
insects can be part of that um circular

97
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:04,318
regenerative food system

98
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:06,599
so when you started beta hatch uh is

99
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:09,839
there a reason that you chose uh meal

100
00:04:06,598 --> 00:04:12,238
worms as your main uh I guess insect

101
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,920
source of uh frass or for breaking down

102
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,759
material versus some of the other

103
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:19,478
options out there like black soldier

104
00:04:15,758 --> 00:04:21,798
flies yeah well so I guess there's the

105
00:04:19,478 --> 00:04:24,800
the technical reasons that I could quote

106
00:04:21,798 --> 00:04:26,198
you you know our bugs are dry adapted um

107
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,800
they've got a lot of genome diversity

108
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:29,400
which is useful for breeding they can

109
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,240
eat all kinds of feed stocks break down

110
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:33,359
Mich toxins there's all kinds of things

111
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,000
like that I could quote but sort of the

112
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,199
initial start which is probably more fun

113
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,439
for your listeners is that I I started

114
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:42,759
off growing bugs in um a little shed at

115
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:44,759
my house in Ballard we called it the

116
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:47,240
Ballard bug burn it was basically a

117
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:49,240
little climate controlled shed that I

118
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,759
grew a couple dozen species of bugs in

119
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,280
while I was experimenting at first and

120
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,759
one of the big things that was a first

121
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:57,638
sign that the mealor was going to be a

122
00:04:54,759 --> 00:05:02,720
good species to work with happened over

123
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:05,478
the summer when I uh went away and uh

124
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,520
had neglected some of my insect colonies

125
00:05:05,478 --> 00:05:10,079
because I had been out on vacation and

126
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:12,439
when I came back um most of the bugs

127
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:15,560
were in trouble you know in the case of

128
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:18,680
some flies had literally flown away but

129
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:21,240
the MS were just happy and contented and

130
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:24,360
uh a few months later I found a box that

131
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:27,079
I had neglected for even longer and um

132
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,560
you know stuffed away sort of back on a

133
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:31,918
shelf and they were also doing just fine

134
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:35,038
these are really Hardy insects and so um

135
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:36,799
that was the the first um you know I

136
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:39,478
guess indications that the mealworm was

137
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,478
going to be a really great insect that

138
00:05:39,478 --> 00:05:43,680
um could handle all kinds of the

139
00:05:41,478 --> 00:05:46,000
challenges that we've run into as we

140
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:49,400
work to scale up production um they're

141
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:53,000
just really hearty bugs that can um you

142
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:53,799
know basically withstand very cold very

143
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,839
hot

144
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:58,759
temperatures um all kinds of humidity

145
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:02,159
levels and can eat almost anything um so

146
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:04,600
it's a uh really they're a really nice

147
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,479
uh insect to work with from a you know

148
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:09,000
if you're a smaller producer just

149
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:10,959
looking to get started producing bugs

150
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,279
one of the easiest ones to to work with

151
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:13,839
but then also from an industrial

152
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:15,719
standpoint where we're working with beta

153
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:17,719
hatch they're super amenable to

154
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,960
Automation and there's a lot of reasons

155
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,639
that it's actually a lot cheaper to

156
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:24,799
produce them so yeah I mean I'd

157
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:26,800
encourage anyone who's um you know

158
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:30,120
interested in in trying out raising some

159
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:32,079
bugs me rooms are a great place to start

160
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:37,120
so I would like to hear from you about

161
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:38,800
what um or or I guess how uh a home user

162
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,439
may be able to start incorporating meal

163
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:44,079
worms into their uh you know their goals

164
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:45,399
for sustainability with composting but

165
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:46,719
before we do can you talk a little bit

166
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:48,318
when you said that meal worms are really

167
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,240
good eating a wide variety of food

168
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,840
sources what sorts of things do you feed

169
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:55,240
your meal worms and what are they best

170
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:58,239
known for in terms of consuming yeah so

171
00:06:55,240 --> 00:07:00,079
we're um you know pretty focused on

172
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,680
ensuring that what we're doing is is as

173
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:03,918
sustainable as possible so we've been

174
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:07,038
looking at industrial co-products and

175
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:09,079
byproducts mostly from food processing

176
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:11,000
um at our facility in Cashmere

177
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:13,519
Washington we're actually one of the

178
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,918
ingredients we use is um a apple

179
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:18,439
byproduct we're in the wachi valley it's

180
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:20,038
the Apple capital and there's a an apple

181
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:22,519
processor just down the road from us

182
00:07:20,038 --> 00:07:23,918
that's probably less than a mile to go

183
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:27,159
and get that feed stock which is

184
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:29,839
incredibly short supply chain so um they

185
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:31,199
can eat actually a huge range of things

186
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:33,478
um we've looked at over a hundred

187
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,199
different ingredients and there's

188
00:07:33,478 --> 00:07:38,000
nothing we found that they can't eat

189
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:40,919
they can actually even eat plastic um

190
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,598
and so you know we've been from an

191
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:44,598
industrial and sort of commercial

192
00:07:42,598 --> 00:07:47,240
perspective focused on feed stocks that

193
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:49,240
make sense for us um economically but

194
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,519
also from a sustainability standpoint

195
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:53,598
trying to make sure that as we're

196
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:56,158
looking at um inputs we're trying to

197
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:57,680
find the ones that have both the the

198
00:07:56,158 --> 00:08:00,000
lowest cost but also the lowest

199
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,400
environmental Footprints um

200
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,279
and making sure we're not diverting food

201
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:07,839
from other uh sources such as other

202
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:10,000
animal feeds um the meal orms are stored

203
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:12,839
grain pests so they've been living for

204
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,519
Millennia with us in our stored grain

205
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:17,158
and so you know the common things people

206
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:21,079
think about are oats and Wheats and uh

207
00:08:17,158 --> 00:08:25,560
those grains that you might um have

208
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:27,279
found a a stray insect in before and

209
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,519
certainly we've done a really good job

210
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:33,079
of eliminated eliminating them as a St

211
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:34,879
grein pests um but the you know that's

212
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,000
sort of their history of how they've

213
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:38,679
evolved um for eating but because

214
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,599
they've been these you know scavengers

215
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:41,838
in many ways they have incredible

216
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:45,360
digestive Powers they're like little

217
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,920
bioreactors and the gut microbes and all

218
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,839
the things living in their guts allow

219
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:50,559
them to break down all kinds of stuff

220
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:53,160
and as I said even plastic the only

221
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:55,679
known way to biodegrade polystyrene or

222
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:57,879
styrofoam is in the gut of a meal worm

223
00:08:55,679 --> 00:09:00,159
so it's a pretty

224
00:08:57,879 --> 00:09:03,439
incredible um set of things that they

225
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:06,559
can be eating now is there any risk of

226
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,640
uh pests or pathogens with mealworm

227
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:09,759
production or

228
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:13,240
rearing well it's an interesting

229
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:15,319
question um we're very much farmers in a

230
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:17,079
typical sense we've got a crop we worry

231
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,680
about you know the pest and disease that

232
00:09:17,078 --> 00:09:21,399
can impact them they can get sick just

233
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:24,838
like anything else viruses and bacteria

234
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:26,919
and um you know in our case pest control

235
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:29,040
of just making sure that we don't have

236
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:30,278
any other insects coming in is a big

237
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:32,439
concern and we've basically made

238
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:34,639
Paradise for bugs everyone wants to live

239
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:38,000
there so we have to be really careful

240
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:42,360
about uh ensuring we don't have any um

241
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,078
pests established in our facility um but

242
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,360
it's also very different than a lot of

243
00:09:44,078 --> 00:09:47,679
traditional farming because it's

244
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:51,079
completely indoors we control every

245
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:54,039
aspect of production from the inputs you

246
00:09:51,078 --> 00:09:55,479
know the growing process you know the

247
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:58,199
sort of manufacturing pieces that just

248
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:01,680
allow us to separate out the product um

249
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:03,839
it it's lot more like a factory kind of

250
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:06,000
setting almost like a clean room setting

251
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:09,959
than it is a farm with soil so it's kind

252
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,759
of an interesting place to um you know

253
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:13,399
we kind of straddled that divide between

254
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:15,759
being a farmer and being a

255
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:17,879
manufacturer um but the beauty of that

256
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:20,078
indoor production is that because we

257
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:23,958
have total control over the process and

258
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:26,000
the inputs there's very minimal uh risk

259
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:30,000
in our products so that means both from

260
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:33,000
a path you know pathogen standpoint the

261
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,919
microbial um components uh and then you

262
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:40,200
know there's no um you know residues of

263
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:42,479
soils or risk of uh things like heavy

264
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,800
metals in the products so across the

265
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,360
board because we have such a great

266
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:47,879
control over how we're growing these

267
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:51,360
meal worms we can actually ensure a much

268
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:53,838
safer product um for both our feed

269
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,519
products where the meal worms themselves

270
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:58,200
are being used as feed we can ensure

271
00:10:56,519 --> 00:11:00,278
that there's been no bioaccumulation of

272
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:02,000
any kind of toxins we can make sure that

273
00:11:00,278 --> 00:11:03,879
it's um you know everything we're doing

274
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,879
is organically produced and so we Source

275
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:09,958
organic ingredients for um our our Pro

276
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:11,958
process and so everything is certified

277
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:14,518
organic and then on the fertilizer side

278
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:17,599
the FR side of the equation um we can

279
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:20,360
also ensure there's no pests or

280
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,920
pathogens in there so this is basically

281
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:25,560
a microm manure where you're not going

282
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:28,919
to have any kind of risk of um any kind

283
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:31,439
of insects or other microbial um issues

284
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:33,039
that might of concern um to anyone who's

285
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,920
using the

286
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:36,799
products yeah I probably we probably

287
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:40,639
should back up and talk about what the

288
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:43,599
end products are from uh your mealworm

289
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:46,879
production and then also what the life

290
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:50,879
cycle of a mealworm is yeah yeah there's

291
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:52,639
a so much um uh to talk about here the

292
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:55,439
the meal worms I'll start with the life

293
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:58,240
cycle um the meal worm as it's commonly

294
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:02,399
known is not a worm at all it's an

295
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:04,079
insect and the adult is a beetle so it's

296
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,799
you know similar to how a butterfly will

297
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:10,078
go through this transformation of uh

298
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:11,879
being a caterpillar to a cocoon or pupil

299
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:13,958
stage into the adult which is a

300
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:16,039
butterfly that lays an egg we have a

301
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:18,278
beetle that lays eggs those hatch into

302
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:19,919
the larvae also known as the meal worms

303
00:12:18,278 --> 00:12:23,600
and that's the main product we Harvest

304
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:25,278
and then a subset of our system we are

305
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,720
breeding these insects and so we allow

306
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:28,720
them to go through pupation they become

307
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,720
Pupa they kind of look like little

308
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,959
aliens in the pupil stage and then those

309
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:37,160
guys will um turn into adults and the

310
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:39,359
cycle continues um and so that whole

311
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:41,759
process can take as as long as a few

312
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,399
months or short as a few weeks um

313
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:45,278
depending on how we handle um handle

314
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,159
them and treat them and what we're

315
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:51,799
feeding them typically we're looking at

316
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:55,759
around two months um from egg to product

317
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:57,599
in our case um and you know as we're

318
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:59,399
growing them the main product is the

319
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,680
meal worms the larvae themselves and so

320
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:06,039
we Harvest those mealor worms as a

321
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:08,039
nutritious high protein high fat feed

322
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:11,000
ingredient for Animals we're really

323
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:12,919
focused right now on backyard birds so

324
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,759
anyone who's got a flock at home this is

325
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:16,278
a

326
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:18,240
fantastic uh way to give a big

327
00:13:16,278 --> 00:13:20,399
nutritional boost to your birds

328
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:24,440
certified organic made right here in

329
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:26,639
Washington and so the um the larvae are

330
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:29,680
the feed ingredient they're great for

331
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,560
poultry but also great for fish um um

332
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:34,239
and increasingly we're we're exploring

333
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:36,759
all our options in pet food so even cats

334
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,039
and dogs love meal wors so that's the

335
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:39,879
bug piece of the equation and then of

336
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:43,519
course as they're growing they're

337
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:45,198
producing uh FR so just as any other

338
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:48,440
animal that's growing they'll produce

339
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:50,758
some kind of manure type products um

340
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:52,240
some kind of you know we call it waste

341
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:54,278
of course we have this you know

342
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,360
vocabulary around waste which in my

343
00:13:54,278 --> 00:13:58,159
opinion I think is going to eventually

344
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:01,079
be eliminated everything we think of is

345
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:03,120
waste now um there's we're increasingly

346
00:14:01,078 --> 00:14:05,599
finding uses for all of our wastes

347
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:08,078
because we see um you know anywhere

348
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,120
there's a product that's coming out of

349
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:10,719
some sort of system There's an

350
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,480
opportunity for someone else and so

351
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,240
that's also where beta hatch has been

352
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,959
really looking at the supply chain

353
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:20,440
trying to say hey where can we find a a

354
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:22,479
waste byproduct and take that feed it to

355
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:25,079
our insects and create something of real

356
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,839
value and so those products are the meal

357
00:14:25,078 --> 00:14:30,638
worms as a a feed and the FR as a

358
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,680
fertilizer

359
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,959
yeah I know uh you know having been a

360
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:39,120
former feed store owner up until last

361
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:41,518
year we sold a ton of dried meal worms

362
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,399
uh literally and you know we call it

363
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,919
chicken crack is what a lot of the home

364
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:46,679
backyard chicken owners called it

365
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:48,198
because chickens will go crazy for it

366
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:50,399
very high in protein which is good for

367
00:14:48,198 --> 00:14:53,519
egg production um as a supplement to

368
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:55,600
their diet but what I didn't realize was

369
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,278
a lot of the ones that we were ordering

370
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:00,320
uh in our supply chain were coming out

371
00:14:57,278 --> 00:15:02,078
of China which um potentially from what

372
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,839
I was reading and I'm not an expert on

373
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:06,439
this but there's a lot more risks of

374
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,000
toxins heavy metals from the production

375
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,320
methods that are being used over there

376
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,198
because there's a lot less

377
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:14,800
oversight um versus say something here

378
00:15:12,198 --> 00:15:19,000
here in the states yeah so I mean it's

379
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:21,479
pretty um unknown but every single dried

380
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,159
meal worm that's on the market today

381
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:26,519
except for the products with our

382
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:28,360
customer chbby mealor worm um is from

383
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:30,959
China so all of the dried mealor worms

384
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:33,600
that you see even if they say they might

385
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:36,758
have been packaged in the US they were

386
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,639
grown in China we're the only domestic

387
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:42,120
producer of meal worms for backyard

388
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:44,600
birds and so we have been really trying

389
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:47,000
to try to bring awareness to this the

390
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,839
fact that you know this treat that a lot

391
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,318
of backyard bird owners are super

392
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:52,360
excited to give to their flock because

393
00:15:50,318 --> 00:15:55,240
yeah it is chicken crack they they love

394
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:57,039
it um but that's coming from China and

395
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:59,759
there are some responsible producers for

396
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:01,799
sure um but there's also just a lot of

397
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,639
unknowns and I actually have been in

398
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:07,559
China and visited some of these

399
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:08,959
operations um you know there's uh just a

400
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:11,838
kind of different approach and standard

401
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:14,239
to production so you know to give you a

402
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:16,519
a case in point even the interpretation

403
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:19,919
of the rules can be a little

404
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:22,000
um I guess Lost in Translation um you

405
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:24,399
know we visited a a facility they said

406
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,839
oh yeah we're only giving pre-consumer

407
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:29,240
grocery waste to our insects and you

408
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,279
know as I'm Turing the operation it was

409
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,639
pretty clear it looked like they were

410
00:16:30,278 --> 00:16:33,278
just eating garbage there's bits of

411
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:35,519
glass and plastic and they kept

412
00:16:33,278 --> 00:16:38,600
reassuring me like no no it's all

413
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:40,959
pre-consumer grocery waste which is what

414
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:44,680
the rules are for responsible production

415
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:46,078
according to the FDA um the the thing

416
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:49,039
that was Lost in Translation here is

417
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:50,958
they weren't actually depackaging any of

418
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:53,799
that grocery waste so they were just

419
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:56,318
grinding up you know plastic containers

420
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:58,039
and glass bottles with whatever that

421
00:16:56,318 --> 00:17:01,039
organic material was and giving that to

422
00:16:58,039 --> 00:17:03,439
the insects well if the insects are

423
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:05,199
actively digesting eating plastic that's

424
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,959
getting into the product and who knows

425
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,038
what other kinds of you know

426
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:11,360
contaminants or things could be getting

427
00:17:09,038 --> 00:17:14,519
in there so yeah there's definitely some

428
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:17,399
concerns with um you know relying on

429
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:18,798
that foreign supply chain for something

430
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,679
that people are putting in their bodies

431
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:22,959
and so that's why we're super excited to

432
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:26,038
get to Market with our American grown

433
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,318
meal worms they're organically produced

434
00:17:26,038 --> 00:17:29,919
um everything that we're giving our

435
00:17:27,318 --> 00:17:34,000
insects is certified organic so we've

436
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:36,160
ensured from the inputs to the end

437
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,880
products that we're making everything is

438
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,759
food grade certified organic um and

439
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,960
grown right here in Washington State uh

440
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:46,319
from waste ingredients so it's a not

441
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:49,240
only domestically produced but complete

442
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:51,480
transparency and Trust of you know just

443
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:54,640
knowledge of what's going into our

444
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:56,038
insects um and that's something that we

445
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,640
think is really important for anyone

446
00:17:56,038 --> 00:18:00,720
who's grown birds that you know if

447
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:03,880
you're going to harvest eggs and um you

448
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,679
know enjoy uh having backyard birds you

449
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,559
want them to be as healthy as possible

450
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:09,360
and so that's why we've seen such great

451
00:18:07,558 --> 00:18:11,079
opportunities with our business and we

452
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:12,639
actually can't grow fast enough that's a

453
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:15,079
it's a great problem to

454
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,400
have um and one of the reasons we're

455
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:19,119
scaling up our production that is great

456
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:21,280
I didn't realize you were the only

457
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:24,199
domestic producers I mean I think I met

458
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:25,558
you uh oh probably five four or five

459
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:28,519
years ago now at the flower and garden

460
00:18:25,558 --> 00:18:30,319
show and you were still kind of uh you

461
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:31,599
know getting production established and

462
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:34,119
things like that so I'm glad we're able

463
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:36,798
to Circle back on that uh one thing you

464
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:40,319
you touched on just now was how uh the

465
00:18:36,798 --> 00:18:41,759
feed stock will affect the final uh

466
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:44,119
product whether it's the meal worm

467
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:45,798
itself or it's frass uh do you have any

468
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:48,479
more information about that like uh has

469
00:18:45,798 --> 00:18:51,000
there been any research done or um have

470
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,640
you seen that NPK values for example

471
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:57,519
will vary based on what you feed the

472
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:59,280
meal worms oh absolutely we've um you

473
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:01,038
know this is one of those chall Alles

474
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:03,480
with marketing any kind of fertilizer

475
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:07,119
products you have sort of a guaranteed

476
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:09,400
minimum on your label um but you know we

477
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:11,639
often are ex you know exceeding those

478
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:15,360
numbers as far as our mpks we guarantee

479
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:18,400
a 232 but we've measured close to 555

480
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:19,879
and and uh with some feed stocks so yeah

481
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:23,440
what you put in really changes what you

482
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:27,400
get out um we're trying to you know get

483
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:29,080
a firm number set for our new facility

484
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,120
so that we can hopefully um adjust some

485
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:33,480
of those numbers

486
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:34,759
accordingly but effectively um yeah what

487
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:37,599
you're feeding the insects is going to

488
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:38,879
change the quality of the frass um one

489
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:40,480
thing that doesn't change though about

490
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,159
the frass regardless of what the mpk

491
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,558
value looks like is that it's a a

492
00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:49,440
product rich in Kaiden um and so there's

493
00:19:45,558 --> 00:19:51,558
a lot of benefits to um sort of the the

494
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,798
non those macronutrients that get a lot

495
00:19:51,558 --> 00:19:55,720
of attention but there's micronutrients

496
00:19:53,798 --> 00:19:58,720
and other components that can have these

497
00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:01,000
other benefits um so there's a lot of

498
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:05,079
know benefits on controlling patod

499
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:08,119
because you can activate um kiten

500
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:10,079
feeding uh microbes in the soil when you

501
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:11,918
are providing a source of kiteen as you

502
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:13,319
get infras and so then that can help

503
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:16,520
lead to bio control of things like

504
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:19,079
nematodes and some of the other um pests

505
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:21,960
that can affect different types of crops

506
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:23,879
um you know magnesium is another uh

507
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:26,440
nutrient that we certify in our products

508
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:28,120
so the frass has um at least a half

509
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:31,440
percentage of magnesium which is really

510
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:33,439
important for the Fring of tomatoes and

511
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:36,080
other night shades and plenty of other

512
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,919
plants so there's not just the mpk but a

513
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:41,599
lot of other um I guess interesting

514
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:44,360
interactions between frass and the soil

515
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:46,158
when you use it as a fertilizer and as a

516
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:49,439
soil

517
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:50,360
amendment that's great so uh one

518
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,279
question I had do you know anything

519
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:54,839
about the microbial content of the final

520
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:57,480
Frost have you guys looked at that at

521
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:59,158
all from a biological perspective yeah

522
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:01,120
we've started to dig in there a little

523
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:03,559
bit more um we actually have a

524
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:07,279
microbiologist on staff and so she's

525
00:21:03,558 --> 00:21:09,879
been um really digging into just all the

526
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:12,240
microbial interactions with their bugs

527
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:14,919
and and in the products um we do know

528
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:17,200
that uh you we certify each batch making

529
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:18,960
sure that there's no pathogenic microbes

530
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,038
like ecoli that are going to be a

531
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,480
problem um but we do know there is a

532
00:21:21,038 --> 00:21:24,558
rich community of microbes there and

533
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:27,519
we're trying to learn as much as we can

534
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:29,558
about how that impacts the soil um we've

535
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:32,158
done some testing with comp postas we

536
00:21:29,558 --> 00:21:35,399
certainly know that as a stimulator for

537
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:38,799
compost Frost can uh really help enrich

538
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:42,200
and feed a compost to to get it started

539
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:44,359
and producing a healthy microbial um

540
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:46,558
consortia but as I'm sure you know with

541
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:48,199
microbes it's just this small world

542
00:21:46,558 --> 00:21:50,558
we're barely scratching the surface up

543
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:53,080
so we're just you know starting to learn

544
00:21:50,558 --> 00:21:56,079
the importance and value of microbes and

545
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:57,960
soils um and we're you know part of that

546
00:21:56,079 --> 00:21:59,119
revolution of trying to really think

547
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:01,440
about

548
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:04,399
fertilizers and soil amendments and soil

549
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:06,038
in a more I guess Community focused way

550
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,840
where we're looking at the community of

551
00:22:06,038 --> 00:22:10,599
microbes and trying to think about what

552
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:12,399
that looks like um so you know I think

553
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:14,119
this is an area we're really excited in

554
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,159
the next growing season to do more field

555
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:19,759
tests on um and we're always looking for

556
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:21,880
testing Partners to um you know help get

557
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:25,079
some independent thirdparty testing of

558
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:27,880
the products done oh that's great yeah

559
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:29,720
no that's wonderful um and and one of

560
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:32,480
the questions that uh I wanted to go

561
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:35,798
back to was also how do people um if

562
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:38,278
they want to say rear meal meal rear

563
00:22:35,798 --> 00:22:39,918
meal worms themselves uh how would you

564
00:22:38,278 --> 00:22:42,759
go about doing that um any

565
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:46,120
recommendations for uh I don't know

566
00:22:42,759 --> 00:22:49,440
websites or books or even just a quick

567
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:51,319
how to right now over the podcast yeah I

568
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,919
mean there's tons of great resources

569
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:55,200
online I've seen lots of really

570
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:57,960
interesting YouTube channels people

571
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:01,278
getting really uh elaborate in their

572
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:03,558
home setups um meal arms are really easy

573
00:23:01,278 --> 00:23:05,359
um you can grow them in a shoe box

574
00:23:03,558 --> 00:23:06,759
basically although I wouldn't recommend

575
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:08,079
a a cardboard shoe box because they can

576
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:12,079
eat through the

577
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:18,678
cardboard um but the uh two resources I

578
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:21,720
would Point people to um one is uh a a a

579
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:24,519
group Karine Katarina angers a great

580
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:27,079
entrepreneur who's done a lot of work on

581
00:23:24,519 --> 00:23:29,720
um insects more of the food Focus but

582
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:31,879
absolutely there's an opport Unity for

583
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:33,360
those insects to be you know they've

584
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:35,919
been really interested in helping people

585
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:37,519
get in in their diet directly but just

586
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:40,159
you're not ready for that getting it

587
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:43,079
into your bird's diet um and so her

588
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:45,919
company on Farm has um actually a little

589
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:47,918
desktop version they call it the hive um

590
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,759
which is a little ready-made kit for

591
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:52,600
growing mealor worms so that's a great

592
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:55,679
place for people to get started um there

593
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:59,079
was also a project called open Bug farm

594
00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:00,519
that um the current

595
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:02,759
folks that were working on that project

596
00:24:00,519 --> 00:24:04,558
um have moved on to other things but I

597
00:24:02,759 --> 00:24:08,359
believe that's still an active resource

598
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:11,720
with a lot of online um uh different

599
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:13,879
forums with questions and they had an

600
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:15,919
active community of people who were you

601
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:19,200
know on this sort of small scale looking

602
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:20,559
to grill bugs contributing their knowhow

603
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,360
and so that's another resource that I

604
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:25,240
would recommend people check out um but

605
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:28,079
the internet is full of great and

606
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:30,720
wonderful things and uh certainly the

607
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:34,558
wealth of knowledge around um farming

608
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:36,240
bugs at home has has really grown so uh

609
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:37,798
I'd recommend yeah know YouTube's got

610
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:41,440
plenty of of interesting great

611
00:24:37,798 --> 00:24:44,000
explainers as well so in theory like a

612
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:47,679
an average you know residential family

613
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:50,278
four could create a a small little

614
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:53,840
mealor worm setup and recycle some of

615
00:24:50,278 --> 00:24:56,839
their waste into potentially a more

616
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:58,879
useful uh product I guess for their

617
00:24:56,839 --> 00:25:01,319
Garden

618
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,720
yeah it's it's possible I will say you

619
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:05,720
know one of the challenges and this is

620
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:08,319
true of any kind of home compost kind of

621
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:11,240
operation or you know any setup you're

622
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:13,439
trying to do to recycle your waste um is

623
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:16,000
is a question of volume and just sort of

624
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,759
time and ability to you know take care

625
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,919
of whatever it is that's helping you

626
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:23,278
break down any kind of organic waste you

627
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:26,000
have um you know I would say meal worms

628
00:25:23,278 --> 00:25:27,759
are they can eat almost anything but

629
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,359
they still need to be fed in a

630
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:33,158
particular way away and they're animals

631
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:35,839
they need they need Care on a fairly

632
00:25:33,159 --> 00:25:37,240
frequent basis and so absolutely would

633
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:39,359
encourage anyone who's interested in

634
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:42,038
trying this out to give it a go but you

635
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:44,278
can also just buy our meal worms if uh

636
00:25:42,038 --> 00:25:46,798
it's it's something that you're finding

637
00:25:44,278 --> 00:25:48,519
a little intimidating um as far as you

638
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:50,480
know thinking about how to get a little

639
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:53,079
home setup going I would actually

640
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:56,360
suggest um you know if you're looking

641
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:59,519
you know composting is a great way to um

642
00:25:56,359 --> 00:26:02,918
I think be be looking at recycling some

643
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:04,519
of your organic waste um and there are

644
00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:05,919
some interesting there's some

645
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:08,480
interesting stuff going on with black

646
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:10,840
soldierly which um handles a much more

647
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:14,240
wet waste which is typically what most

648
00:26:10,839 --> 00:26:16,519
People's Kitchen waste is like um and

649
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,919
that's uh another you know the the black

650
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:22,440
soldier fly is a type of fly so they

651
00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:24,880
produce a larvae that um as I said lives

652
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:26,679
more of this kind of wet feed um the

653
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:29,200
challenge is of course that they're fly

654
00:26:26,679 --> 00:26:30,480
so they um you know getting a reliable

655
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,200
breeding system going for black

656
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,200
soldierly on a home basis can be a

657
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:36,919
little challenging especially in the

658
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:39,399
winter um but there's plenty of um

659
00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:41,720
different uh suppliers that you can buy

660
00:26:39,398 --> 00:26:43,519
animals from both the black soldierly or

661
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:45,679
meal worm or any other type of bug that

662
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:48,359
you're interested in growing there's um

663
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:50,320
a pretty active live market that's

664
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:52,000
actually seen a lot of growth um through

665
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:54,759
the last year because there's been this

666
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,278
huge surgeon interest in uh backyard

667
00:26:54,759 --> 00:26:59,038
birds and

668
00:26:56,278 --> 00:27:01,640
homesteading so I'm very excited to see

669
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:02,798
that Trend I hope it continues into 2021

670
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:05,840
and

671
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:08,798
Beyond yeah I got to tour a facility up

672
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:12,119
in Vancouver that grows black soldierly

673
00:27:08,798 --> 00:27:13,720
and produces uh oh nice an insect frass

674
00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:14,959
and it was it was pretty cool to see I

675
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:16,278
didn't you know when I first started

676
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,278
looking into this I didn't realize that

677
00:27:16,278 --> 00:27:19,640
black soldier fly adults when they're in

678
00:27:18,278 --> 00:27:22,000
the fly form they don't eat so they

679
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:23,759
don't transmit the same diseases that

680
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,880
your traditional house fly it gets

681
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:29,038
attributed to um which was really

682
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:32,679
interesting and so I actually I tried

683
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:36,759
uh raising um black soldier flies I

684
00:27:32,679 --> 00:27:40,000
bought one of those uh protopod larvae

685
00:27:36,759 --> 00:27:42,480
uh things and I had no luck uh getting

686
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,519
any naturalization here in the Seattle

687
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,720
area but apparently some people have I

688
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:49,399
tried for a couple seasons and uh

689
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,960
finally gave up on that but um I know

690
00:27:49,398 --> 00:27:52,558
some people in certain areas are like oh

691
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,960
black soldier flies are everywhere they

692
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:58,480
contaminate my compost pile is how some

693
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:00,519
people look at it but um yep they are

694
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,519
pretty amazing creatures and I just want

695
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:04,679
to mention so we do you know through

696
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:08,278
through kiss Organics we do have a black

697
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:10,200
soldierly frass that we offer as well as

698
00:28:08,278 --> 00:28:12,679
we're going to start offering uh your

699
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:15,080
the beta hatch mealworm product as well

700
00:28:12,679 --> 00:28:16,360
which I'm really excited about too um

701
00:28:15,079 --> 00:28:18,519
after looking at

702
00:28:16,359 --> 00:28:22,079
it yeah well and it's interesting

703
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:26,200
because the the word fras is just you

704
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:28,158
know it's a term for bug poop um but you

705
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:30,880
know slightly different process here so

706
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:33,640
so the uh meal worm frass is actually

707
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,679
pure frass we sift it out in a way that

708
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:38,399
we're basically getting little tiny

709
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:40,159
granules of bug poop people used to ask

710
00:28:38,398 --> 00:28:41,398
like how do you collect it I made the

711
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,640
joke well we just have lots of tiny

712
00:28:41,398 --> 00:28:45,119
little doggy

713
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:47,360
bags and uh but it looks kind of like

714
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:49,639
sand right so this is a podcast people

715
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:52,398
aren't really seeing what we're talking

716
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:54,799
about um you can kind of just imagine

717
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:56,879
you know probably people are imagining

718
00:28:54,798 --> 00:28:58,119
um you know when they've looked at their

719
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,600
compost pile and what that looks like

720
00:28:58,119 --> 00:29:01,119
with a bunch of you know maggots in

721
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:03,319
there and that kind of thing it's it's a

722
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:05,479
very clean operation inside and

723
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:07,240
controlled the products and just so that

724
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:09,360
everyone again can sort of imagine what

725
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:11,120
they look like the meal worms you know

726
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:16,519
it just looks like a little about an

727
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:18,359
inch long uh a little larvae um very um

728
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:22,919
kind of like a little half half you know

729
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:25,398
cresant Moon uh inchon little dried um

730
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:28,200
they almost look like a snack um like a

731
00:29:25,398 --> 00:29:30,558
cheex mix sort of ingredient yeah and

732
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:32,240
the frass the frass um the mealor frass

733
00:29:30,558 --> 00:29:34,839
is is basically like a sand so it's

734
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:37,798
really easy to apply because it's that

735
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:40,119
pure frass um it has a really good and

736
00:29:37,798 --> 00:29:43,000
consistent nutritional value um black

737
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:46,000
soldierly frass um you know sometimes

738
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,519
has a mix of other inputs in it um

739
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,640
because the the diet is harder to

740
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:51,919
separate from the fras but it's also a

741
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:53,038
great ingredient for any kind of soil

742
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:55,360
amendment or

743
00:29:53,038 --> 00:29:57,599
fertilization so yeah I mean I would

744
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:59,558
definitely hope that your listeners are

745
00:29:57,599 --> 00:30:03,319
um stress than trying it out in their

746
00:29:59,558 --> 00:30:07,278
Gardens yeah it's definitely a larger uh

747
00:30:03,319 --> 00:30:09,319
larger sized um and and more varied

748
00:30:07,278 --> 00:30:11,558
amendment in terms of the way it looks

749
00:30:09,319 --> 00:30:13,000
compared to the insect frat that we're

750
00:30:11,558 --> 00:30:15,798
talking about with the mealor worms your

751
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,119
product is is much finer I it's very

752
00:30:15,798 --> 00:30:18,639
obvious when you look at them side by

753
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:21,599
side and they have slightly different

754
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:24,480
NPK levels as well like you mentioned um

755
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:28,558
and I assume a different consortia of uh

756
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:30,319
microbes when we yeah you know I had

757
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:32,879
oh go ahead go ahead I was gonna say I

758
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:35,439
haven't seen any um work on it yet

759
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,519
comparing these two kind of the two

760
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,640
products but there's some really

761
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:41,079
interesting work coming out of Europe

762
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:43,159
and parts of Asia as well um where

763
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:45,720
there's been a lot of good independent

764
00:30:43,159 --> 00:30:48,159
science and data on frass both me worm

765
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:49,399
fras and black soldierly fras and like

766
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:50,679
you're asking about the microbes this is

767
00:30:49,398 --> 00:30:54,518
kind of like all the things that we

768
00:30:50,679 --> 00:30:57,320
can't see that are in there um having

769
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:59,440
these benefits and um you know they've

770
00:30:57,319 --> 00:31:03,638
been finding some really interesting

771
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:06,278
compelling um I guess value to fras

772
00:31:03,638 --> 00:31:09,359
that's beyond just the mpk so one of the

773
00:31:06,278 --> 00:31:12,599
studies um was published actually in

774
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:15,599
nature um as as part of their group of

775
00:31:12,599 --> 00:31:19,119
journals um and they looked at me FR and

776
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:20,798
found when you take a control group

777
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:23,798
where it's just you know exactly the

778
00:31:20,798 --> 00:31:26,480
same NPK profile and you take you know

779
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:29,480
the fras group The FR group

780
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:31,120
outperforms uh the NPK group so you know

781
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:33,880
when you look at a nutritionally

782
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:35,839
equivalent control that's not derived

783
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:38,919
from frost there's something that sort

784
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:40,199
of inex inexplicable something and

785
00:31:38,919 --> 00:31:43,600
there's definitely that question of is

786
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:45,159
this a microbe is it the kiden what is

787
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:46,678
what's happening that's you know

788
00:31:45,159 --> 00:31:48,000
basically creating this bio stimulant

789
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:50,159
effect in the plants and that's

790
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,359
something that Mech mechanistically is

791
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:54,159
still being looked into but you know

792
00:31:52,359 --> 00:31:56,319
it's pretty clear from all the growth

793
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:58,399
trials um that there's something there

794
00:31:56,319 --> 00:32:00,720
that's um causing

795
00:31:58,398 --> 00:32:02,558
better plant performance um and we've

796
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,759
seen that in our our tests too we just

797
00:32:02,558 --> 00:32:06,960
did a bunch of field trials one of my

798
00:32:04,759 --> 00:32:09,720
favorites I I grew a bunch of

799
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:11,600
jalapenos at my house this summer I have

800
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,759
way more than I know what to do with so

801
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:17,480
I don't know if you have any good salsa

802
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:19,599
recipes yeah I'm I'm flush with

803
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:22,038
jalapenos now because of this growth

804
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:23,959
test um but one of the surprising

805
00:32:22,038 --> 00:32:25,679
results is that we actually got twice as

806
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:28,200
many fruits that were twice as large

807
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:29,960
with our fres treatment and we ran you

808
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:32,319
know a negative control and also a

809
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:34,399
positive control against a couple other

810
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:35,720
just commercial products that are and

811
00:32:34,398 --> 00:32:39,239
and did a you know made sure everything

812
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:41,798
was nutrient similar as far as mpk goes

813
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:43,440
and we got this extra fruit production

814
00:32:41,798 --> 00:32:45,759
and so it's kind of again hard to

815
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,000
pinpoint why but we know that that's a

816
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:48,638
real effect that we're seeing with the

817
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,679
use of

818
00:32:48,638 --> 00:32:52,119
frass yeah I think that's a really

819
00:32:50,679 --> 00:32:54,919
interesting point when we talk about the

820
00:32:52,119 --> 00:32:56,918
biological aspects of it and uh one

821
00:32:54,919 --> 00:32:58,159
thing i' I'd like to touch on is that

822
00:32:56,919 --> 00:33:01,200
that you mentioned at the end is is that

823
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:04,120
you do need to take into account the NPK

824
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:07,440
value when you know formulating or

825
00:33:04,119 --> 00:33:09,398
adding it into your soil but um assuming

826
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:12,000
you're doing that I think you guys are

827
00:33:09,398 --> 00:33:14,599
recommending around a cup per cubic foot

828
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:18,000
uh is a safe

829
00:33:14,599 --> 00:33:21,480
rate I mean as far as yeah as far as the

830
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:24,558
safe rate because it's got this you know

831
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:26,558
um pretty mellow uh nutrient

832
00:33:24,558 --> 00:33:28,558
concentration this isn't a fertilizer

833
00:33:26,558 --> 00:33:30,720
that's going to burn your your plants or

834
00:33:28,558 --> 00:33:32,519
cause any issues with over

835
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,319
application um in the same way that you

836
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:36,839
would see with say like a a synthetic

837
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:38,798
fertilizer so yeah typically about a cup

838
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:42,480
per cubic foot is a great application

839
00:33:38,798 --> 00:33:44,839
rate um but even a teaspoon or

840
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,278
tablespoon in a cubic foot can have an

841
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:49,158
impact based on some of the work that

842
00:33:46,278 --> 00:33:51,480
we've done so yeah again that that

843
00:33:49,159 --> 00:33:52,559
intangible I mean oh man I'd love to do

844
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:54,558
a follow- up next year after we've done

845
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:56,480
a little more research and started to

846
00:33:54,558 --> 00:33:59,440
understand the microbial component

847
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:03,200
because yeah there a lot to look into

848
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:05,120
there um we're one of the tests we're um

849
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,798
going to be doing this coming fall is

850
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:09,799
actually looking at frass in Martian

851
00:34:07,798 --> 00:34:11,679
soil so we're really interested in the

852
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:14,560
application of what we do to space

853
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:17,639
travel um thinking about Clos Loop and

854
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:21,398
enclosed food production systems and so

855
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:23,639
we've ordered some uh simulated Martian

856
00:34:21,398 --> 00:34:26,358
soil it's developed by the jet

857
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:29,000
propulsion lab and we're um going to be

858
00:34:26,358 --> 00:34:32,838
using our frass to fertilize it and and

859
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:35,079
get a sense of how it performs as a uh

860
00:34:32,838 --> 00:34:38,320
basically a source of nutrition and

861
00:34:35,079 --> 00:34:40,359
otherwise sterile uh kind of soil so I

862
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:42,440
should have some updates on that that

863
00:34:40,358 --> 00:34:43,799
trial in a couple months for you oh

864
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:45,519
that's fun yeah I look forward to

865
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:50,599
hearing that that's uh that's really

866
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:53,159
cool um I know that from working with uh

867
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:55,599
some researchers in the lab up in Canada

868
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:59,599
they looked at black soldierly frass and

869
00:34:55,599 --> 00:35:02,519
found in this particular produc are uh

870
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:06,119
good levels of calcium solubilizing and

871
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:09,280
phosphorus solubilizing bacteria so I

872
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:11,440
think there is a lot to be said for the

873
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:14,320
you know the the microbes that are being

874
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:16,559
you know excreted or the gut microbes

875
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:18,599
from these insects as as like you said

876
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:20,078
that sort of intangible benefit that

877
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:21,800
we're still I don't know that we'll ever

878
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:25,359
learn all the mechanisms of soil science

879
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:26,720
or or insects for that matter but uh you

880
00:35:25,358 --> 00:35:28,199
know there there is something to it

881
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:31,959
Beyond just

882
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:34,358
the NPK values of of the product itself

883
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:35,838
for sure yeah oh yeah and we're

884
00:35:34,358 --> 00:35:38,759
definitely really interested in nitrogen

885
00:35:35,838 --> 00:35:40,000
fixing bacteria we've um we know like

886
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:42,440
basically we've done some genomic

887
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,159
analysis we know each of these players

888
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:47,800
are there and present it's just that

889
00:35:45,159 --> 00:35:49,679
question of how abundant are they what

890
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:51,400
are they doing in with the frass and the

891
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:52,759
soil those are the kind of questions

892
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,240
we're trying to dig into a bit more and

893
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:55,920
trying to figure out if we can boost

894
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:58,598
those beneficial microbes a little bit

895
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,358
more in the product um but yeah lots to

896
00:35:58,599 --> 00:36:02,359
learn it's it's a really exciting time

897
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:04,239
to be involved in insect

898
00:36:02,358 --> 00:36:06,799
agriculture yeah so when people are

899
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:08,838
using it with their plants are they just

900
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:10,800
uh you know you said teaspoon tablespoon

901
00:36:08,838 --> 00:36:13,719
or even a cup per cubic foot are they

902
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:16,039
mixing it in uh prior to planting or are

903
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:18,199
people using as a top dress are there

904
00:36:16,039 --> 00:36:20,119
any like best practices that you've seen

905
00:36:18,199 --> 00:36:22,118
with this particular

906
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:23,960
fertilizer yeah I mean I definitely

907
00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:25,760
recommend if you can blend it in that's

908
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:29,358
great it will work as a top dress as

909
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:31,079
well um it it has a fraction of the

910
00:36:29,358 --> 00:36:33,719
nutrients of course that are soluble and

911
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:36,359
we'll sort of water in um but you'll see

912
00:36:33,719 --> 00:36:39,679
of course some of that uh it doesn't

913
00:36:36,358 --> 00:36:42,039
dissolve completely so it'll stay uh on

914
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:45,719
the surface um as you water it in over a

915
00:36:42,039 --> 00:36:47,639
few few days or few weeks um but the

916
00:36:45,719 --> 00:36:49,480
nutrition from the frass is still

917
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:52,598
getting into the soil even with a top

918
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:55,199
dress um so it's a a fairly flexible

919
00:36:52,599 --> 00:37:00,559
product in that sense um you know we've

920
00:36:55,199 --> 00:37:04,118
done trials even at larger scale with um

921
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:06,358
traditional uh Field farm equipment for

922
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:08,200
uh dispensing fertilizer and that's a

923
00:37:06,358 --> 00:37:10,799
top dress application and it's gotten

924
00:37:08,199 --> 00:37:12,719
really good results that way so um we

925
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,839
know both you know blending and mixing

926
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:17,000
if you can at the beginning of the

927
00:37:13,838 --> 00:37:19,279
season is the best way to make sure that

928
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,358
the those nutrients are near the roots

929
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:24,640
where you really need to have that

930
00:37:21,358 --> 00:37:27,239
nutrition but a top dress um also just

931
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:30,358
sort of as a mid-season um addition is

932
00:37:27,239 --> 00:37:31,799
also a great way to to use FR us as well

933
00:37:30,358 --> 00:37:35,119
um and I should also say we've used it

934
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:39,200
indoors uh fairly often it doesn't have

935
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:41,240
really any kind of odor um and you can

936
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:45,159
um be using this we've I Ed it on my

937
00:37:41,239 --> 00:37:46,959
indoor plants so um there's a lot of

938
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:50,199
broad ranges of applications for the

939
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:52,318
fres that we produce um and we're really

940
00:37:50,199 --> 00:37:56,358
excited to be able to start making more

941
00:37:52,318 --> 00:37:59,440
in the next year as our new um big bug

942
00:37:56,358 --> 00:38:01,119
Factory I guess opened up in cashmir so

943
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:05,480
we're very excited next season's going

944
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:07,240
to be uh lots of frass out there um

945
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:09,400
hopefully growing lots of great food for

946
00:38:07,239 --> 00:38:11,959
people here in Washington and

947
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:14,318
Beyond I'm looking for to next season as

948
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:15,599
well uh for a variety of reasons with

949
00:38:14,318 --> 00:38:18,079
everything going on in the world these

950
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:21,838
days uh next year will definitely be a

951
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:23,318
better year um one question I wanted to

952
00:38:21,838 --> 00:38:25,679
ask you do you see with these top

953
00:38:23,318 --> 00:38:28,039
dressing applications uh due to the

954
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:32,679
biology in the frass are you seeing like

955
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:35,838
melal growth or um mold over time

956
00:38:32,679 --> 00:38:37,559
growing from we've never seen no we've

957
00:38:35,838 --> 00:38:40,318
never seen that um in the test that

958
00:38:37,559 --> 00:38:42,480
we've done um I'm sure it's it's a

959
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:44,199
possible uh effect because you just

960
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,920
never know what's in the soil that might

961
00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:49,399
get activated but from the frass itself

962
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:52,599
there's never been any growth like that

963
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:54,440
so um that's not typically been

964
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:56,680
something that we've noticed in any of

965
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:58,159
the trials that we've done and the

966
00:38:56,679 --> 00:39:01,639
microbiology that you're seeing in the

967
00:38:58,159 --> 00:39:05,078
fras is it uh strictly bacteria or maybe

968
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:09,400
ARA in in the there's some there's some

969
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:12,359
fungal um microbes as well um yeah man I

970
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:15,960
wish my microbiologist Ola was able to

971
00:39:12,358 --> 00:39:17,838
join us so she's a done a lot of work on

972
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:19,039
you know everything from what's inside

973
00:39:17,838 --> 00:39:22,358
the mealor worms so then of course what

974
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:25,480
ends up outside in the frass and um yeah

975
00:39:22,358 --> 00:39:28,838
we've seen all kinds of fungal micro

976
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:31,159
microbia um it's kind of a cross spans

977
00:39:28,838 --> 00:39:34,279
you know the whole Spectrum uh of what

978
00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:37,118
you might expect um and we don't have at

979
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:39,400
this time any particular treatment for

980
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:42,240
the fras we we're trying to maintain as

981
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:45,000
much of that natural microbiota as we

982
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:47,039
can so we're not doing any kind of heat

983
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,239
treatment or sterilization because we do

984
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:50,559
know that there's some of that um you

985
00:39:49,239 --> 00:39:52,879
know certainly it's something we can do

986
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:54,799
for a customer if they're concerned but

987
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:57,960
we see a lot of value in maintaining

988
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:59,720
that natural good microbial consor that

989
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:02,639
is valuable for

990
00:39:59,719 --> 00:40:04,239
soil yeah I think one of the main the

991
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:06,159
biggest benefit is probably the

992
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:10,039
biological aspect so I'm glad to hear

993
00:40:06,159 --> 00:40:12,399
that it is microbial active um yeah and

994
00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:14,838
you're not sterilizing it right well and

995
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:16,519
I think that the kiden uh component as

996
00:40:14,838 --> 00:40:18,159
well is something that we're very

997
00:40:16,519 --> 00:40:19,838
interested in continuing to explore so

998
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:22,039
that's not necessarily it's not a you

999
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:25,358
know something live in of itself but it

1000
00:40:22,039 --> 00:40:28,400
nourishes naturally existent microbes in

1001
00:40:25,358 --> 00:40:30,119
the soil um to help defend against some

1002
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:32,160
of these pathogens that can impact

1003
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:34,960
different um types of plants and so

1004
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:36,920
that's another area that we're going to

1005
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:39,079
be working on doing some some future

1006
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:40,639
testing um and we have ways in our

1007
00:40:39,079 --> 00:40:43,280
process of kind of increasing how much

1008
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:44,519
Cen content there is in the in the frost

1009
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,560
and so we see that as an interesting

1010
00:40:44,519 --> 00:40:48,039
opportunity down the road as we you know

1011
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:49,838
start to learn more and more about the

1012
00:40:48,039 --> 00:40:52,000
products that we we have which we know

1013
00:40:49,838 --> 00:40:53,719
are great just finding ways to make them

1014
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,719
even better is something that I'm really

1015
00:40:53,719 --> 00:40:58,039
excited

1016
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:59,199
