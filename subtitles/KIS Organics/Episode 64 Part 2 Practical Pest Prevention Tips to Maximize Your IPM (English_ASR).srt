00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:21,000
welcome to the cannabis cultivation and

3
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,100
science podcast

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,350
I'm your host tad hussy of KISS organics

5
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,609
this is the podcast where we discuss the

6
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,618
cutting edge of growing from a

7
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:30,150
science-based perspective and drawn top

8
00:00:28,618 --> 00:00:32,070
experts from around the industry to

9
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:33,600
share their wisdom and knowledge this

10
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:35,308
week's podcast is all about pest

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,050
management and is the second part of my

12
00:00:35,308 --> 00:00:38,429
interview with Kelly Vance if you

13
00:00:37,049 --> 00:00:40,529
haven't listened to the first part I'd

14
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:42,090
suggest checking that out first and you

15
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:43,439
can learn a bit more about Kelly and his

16
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,660
background in horticulture and

17
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:47,820
integrated pest management now on to the

18
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:50,759
show

19
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:53,070
so uh getting back I had this list of

20
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:54,299
questions and we keep we can already

21
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:57,480
kind of been floating around I've known

22
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:59,759
I've enjoyed our discussion I go into

23
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:01,890
the rock yeah I want to talk about your

24
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:03,960
experience in coming from large green

25
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:05,640
house and production setting like what

26
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,500
practices did you see that you were

27
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,219
using on the horticultural side that

28
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:13,189
hasn't really made it into cannabis that

29
00:01:10,219 --> 00:01:16,259
you think should should be implemented

30
00:01:13,189 --> 00:01:18,659
um you know I used to say and I will

31
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:20,430
I'll go back to help I'll just repeat

32
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:23,609
the crop staging just because I I

33
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:25,680
believe that all things that fundamental

34
00:01:23,609 --> 00:01:27,179
things need to be repeated until you get

35
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,060
annoyed with them because at that point

36
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:34,530
is concreted into your head crop staging

37
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:36,899
is one I use to say quarantine although

38
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:39,390
I am starting to see more of it so I'm

39
00:01:36,899 --> 00:01:42,420
I'm actually really excited to see that

40
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:45,019
and in fact the grower who was the

41
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:48,539
absolute best at it that I ever met

42
00:01:45,019 --> 00:01:50,849
after two years of practically begging

43
00:01:48,539 --> 00:01:53,939
him now works for us

44
00:01:50,849 --> 00:01:56,280
that's our Repsol who I was working with

45
00:01:53,938 --> 00:01:59,449
at the time that he's a large green

46
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:02,400
house cannabis operation in Salinas and

47
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:05,490
he had a whole greenhouse set up for

48
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:07,890
quarantine of incoming plants dip

49
00:02:05,489 --> 00:02:09,539
dipping protocols I'm sure that you guys

50
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,539
have talked about dipping on the show by

51
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:14,489
now and actually quarantine after the

52
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:19,259
fact before any of these plants go out

53
00:02:14,489 --> 00:02:21,450
in any of these greenhouses but I still

54
00:02:19,259 --> 00:02:23,189
see tons of people especially this time

55
00:02:21,449 --> 00:02:24,539
of year the early beginning of the

56
00:02:23,189 --> 00:02:26,400
season they're bringing in plant

57
00:02:24,539 --> 00:02:28,889
material from all over the place

58
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,110
sometimes I've had them tell me that

59
00:02:28,889 --> 00:02:34,319
yeah I know that I got I know that i got

60
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:36,390
my russet mites from XYZ and then the

61
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:39,389
next year they buy from the same person

62
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:41,669
and okay let's pretend they're the only

63
00:02:39,389 --> 00:02:43,649
source you still need your plants but

64
00:02:41,669 --> 00:02:45,298
you haven't implemented some kind of a

65
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:49,079
quarantine when you know for a fact that

66
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:52,409
you've had issues from these so that's a

67
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:54,540
huge one and one that I see a lot of but

68
00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:57,569
not enough of - when you consider the

69
00:02:54,539 --> 00:02:59,519
value of this crop is just general PPE

70
00:02:57,569 --> 00:03:02,280
in the greenhouse and

71
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:03,990
I don't know what the proper term

72
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:07,140
because all of this falls under cultural

73
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:10,050
control in the in a tired old IPM

74
00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:12,449
pyramid but um you know you just don't

75
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:15,480
see any control of who's working in what

76
00:03:12,449 --> 00:03:18,030
area and then moving to other areas I'll

77
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:19,889
say that sometimes I ask growers to do a

78
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:22,620
little more than I used to do in the

79
00:03:19,889 --> 00:03:24,569
greenhouse but I because we didn't

80
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,920
really a lot of this stuff it wasn't

81
00:03:24,569 --> 00:03:27,629
like we had it running like a Swiss

82
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:29,759
watch in my greenhouses we had very

83
00:03:27,629 --> 00:03:31,229
chaotic days where I would end up in

84
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:34,409
every greenhouse by the end of the day

85
00:03:31,229 --> 00:03:36,419
but for the most part we had our stock

86
00:03:34,409 --> 00:03:39,509
fuchsia greenhouse which is those were

87
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:44,069
our mother plants so I am NOT going to

88
00:03:39,509 --> 00:03:45,899
go spend all day in the Sun bersia which

89
00:03:44,069 --> 00:03:47,639
I know are crawling with spider mites

90
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:50,069
and threats and then go work in the

91
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:53,339
stock fuchsias that I see plenty of

92
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:54,840
people in cannabis grows and when you

93
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,960
get into an indoor cannabis grow I'm

94
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,430
sure you've been in enough of them like

95
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:01,349
these guys are paying a lot for that

96
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:03,810
facility so they're trying to use every

97
00:04:01,349 --> 00:04:06,599
square foot for plant canopy as possible

98
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:08,490
so like unless you are a teeny tiny

99
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:10,319
little person it's impossible to walk

100
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:12,360
through one of those rooms without I

101
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:15,419
like to say getting getting to know

102
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:17,879
their plants so there's no way you're

103
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:19,858
spending all day in this room that has

104
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:21,089
spider mites has athens has whatever and

105
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:24,870
then you're going to go work in the moms

106
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:27,779
for the rest of the day taking cuts that

107
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:29,610
to me is just like a no-brainer but it's

108
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:31,409
very frustrating when I see it happening

109
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:35,460
and you see these small facilities that

110
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:37,950
just keep recycling their problem yeah

111
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:39,419
Justin Justin has a good analogy for

112
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:42,000
this that kind of liked he looks at like

113
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:43,800
a river so he always starts at the head

114
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,269
of the river like the area that has the

115
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:50,220
least amount of pest pressure you know

116
00:04:48,269 --> 00:04:52,560
like your mother in theory should be

117
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,910
your cleanest part you know and

118
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,259
propagation that needs to be the

119
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:56,850
cleanest part of your facility and it's

120
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:58,680
the easiest area to control because you

121
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:00,000
have the least amount of canopy so you

122
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,340
should be able to keep that area clean

123
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,259
and then you work your way through and

124
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:06,599
end you always end in the flower room

125
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:08,849
because these are your oldest you know

126
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,650
probably most stressed finishing plants

127
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:12,449
that are going into senescence then

128
00:05:10,649 --> 00:05:14,299
those are the ones that are gonna have

129
00:05:12,449 --> 00:05:17,639
in theory the worst amount of bugs

130
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:21,838
that's the first thing that when when we

131
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:23,338
visit whether it's a farm or and it's no

132
00:05:21,838 --> 00:05:25,168
matter what the crop is no matter what

133
00:05:23,338 --> 00:05:26,639
the layout is the first thing that we

134
00:05:25,168 --> 00:05:29,338
ask is do you have any areas that are

135
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,769
really infested and if they say yeah we

136
00:05:29,338 --> 00:05:35,098
should take me there last you know and

137
00:05:31,769 --> 00:05:38,549
one of the things that that we try to

138
00:05:35,098 --> 00:05:41,819
stay on top of is we try to keep our own

139
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:44,460
PPE on us as well so a lot of times if

140
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:46,740
we show up to a facility a lot of times

141
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:49,968
they provide you a Tyvek or you know at

142
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:52,560
least a lab coat or something to wear

143
00:05:49,968 --> 00:05:55,319
occasionally you know you get there and

144
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,819
even I've done it where even the the

145
00:05:55,319 --> 00:06:00,060
growers themselves aren't wearing this

146
00:05:56,819 --> 00:06:02,009
stuff I throw it on just because I don't

147
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:04,769
want to be for one I might be visiting

148
00:06:02,009 --> 00:06:07,229
three or four operations that day and

149
00:06:04,769 --> 00:06:08,818
for another I don't want to be two

150
00:06:07,228 --> 00:06:09,990
months from now when you have a problem

151
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:12,270
and you start thinking yeah but it was

152
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:13,978
that bug guy he walks around at bugs all

153
00:06:12,269 --> 00:06:17,609
day and he came here and walked around

154
00:06:13,978 --> 00:06:19,528
in our plants so uh yeah that that I

155
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:24,360
like to tell growers try to have I like

156
00:06:19,528 --> 00:06:26,129
the river analogy I might uh whose was

157
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,800
that so I can properly credit them if I

158
00:06:26,129 --> 00:06:31,110
use it my buddy Justin I think he met

159
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:39,598
him at the biocontrol conference he was

160
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:41,610
yeah yeah yeah yeah anyway so I just

161
00:06:39,598 --> 00:06:44,759
would add like for me when I go visit

162
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:46,499
these facilities I'll only go to one in

163
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:48,439
a day and I'll make sure I'm putting on

164
00:06:46,499 --> 00:06:51,300
clean clothes fresh out of the laundry

165
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:52,620
clean shoes especially like I'm not

166
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:55,379
going to take I'm not going to go walk

167
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:57,870
around my farm and then go visit a

168
00:06:55,379 --> 00:06:59,399
facility and then it I have had to visit

169
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:02,550
two facilities in one day and I

170
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:05,430
literally did a full clothing change in

171
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:07,110
that case and especially my shoes not

172
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:09,478
because you know like you said you just

173
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:11,338
don't want to be a potential vector and

174
00:07:09,478 --> 00:07:15,360
a lot of places don't I find don't have

175
00:07:11,338 --> 00:07:17,310
tae Baek seeds or PPE and I you know

176
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,139
frankly I don't know that that's a

177
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:20,038
complete solution I think it's part of

178
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:23,218
the picture like we want to do

179
00:07:20,038 --> 00:07:26,430
everything we can to reduce transmission

180
00:07:23,218 --> 00:07:28,649
but I think every facility should just

181
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:30,540
plan on getting bugs plan on getting

182
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:32,189
you're gonna have to deal with rude

183
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:34,410
aphids and ham press it and thrips and

184
00:07:32,189 --> 00:07:36,480
all of these things don't think that any

185
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:38,250
facility is immune from these so you

186
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,629
better have a plan ahead of time and you

187
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,189
should I think bowel controls are a

188
00:07:39,629 --> 00:07:43,409
great preventative maybe we should talk

189
00:07:41,189 --> 00:07:45,000
about that a little bit just because you

190
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:46,980
don't have insects now doesn't mean you

191
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,069
shouldn't be using bio controls now it's

192
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:52,470
a perfect time for bowel controls right

193
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:55,230
prevention is the key for us to have

194
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:57,830
success and it is it's one of the things

195
00:07:55,230 --> 00:08:00,240
that you have to maybe slightly relearn

196
00:07:57,829 --> 00:08:01,829
or at least learn from a different

197
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,629
perspective if you're switching from

198
00:08:01,829 --> 00:08:06,359
conventional pest management into bio

199
00:08:03,629 --> 00:08:08,430
control is but it is funny though

200
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:11,550
because I do recall back to my days of

201
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:13,139
doing a lot of spraying and a lot of the

202
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:15,689
classes that we would take when we were

203
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:17,250
getting our CE use for our applicator

204
00:08:15,689 --> 00:08:19,019
license you know they're telling you do

205
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:21,029
preventive sprays so they're even

206
00:08:19,019 --> 00:08:24,959
talking about spraying before you have a

207
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:27,869
problem so it is kind of a hard thing to

208
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:29,399
get a grower used to the idea of well I

209
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:32,700
don't have pest pressure why am i

210
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:34,470
putting out bugs and one of the

211
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:37,050
challenges of that to me is a lot of

212
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:39,540
times chemicals only have one rate so

213
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:41,789
you know that's the amount that you mix

214
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:43,259
whether you have a little bit of threats

215
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:46,049
or you have a lot of threats a lot of

216
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:48,210
times chemicals will have ranges we have

217
00:08:46,049 --> 00:08:50,069
low rate high rate and that's when I do

218
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:53,370
try to put that into perspective for

219
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:56,820
growers where the whole concept of

220
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:58,679
having a presence in your crop to make

221
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:02,430
it unattractive for pests in the first

222
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:03,899
place is what keeps the control when

223
00:09:02,429 --> 00:09:07,139
they do show up because they're

224
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:09,840
outnumbered if you wait until you have a

225
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:11,100
pest problem to address it it's all

226
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,170
about numbers it's all about

227
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:16,620
outnumbering and overwhelming the pests

228
00:09:13,169 --> 00:09:19,679
so when you have five or six thrips and

229
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:22,769
here's the thing I have never ever in my

230
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:25,109
life been in a pest free crop and I've

231
00:09:22,769 --> 00:09:27,210
had growers tell me they grow pest free

232
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:28,980
crops I don't believe them I have never

233
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:33,629
grown a pest free crop in my entire

234
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:35,820
career when you start out with a fresh

235
00:09:33,629 --> 00:09:37,620
new dip you need to assume that you

236
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,850
didn't get thrips eggs that might be in

237
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,649
the lease

238
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:42,298
to assume that you might not have gotten

239
00:09:40,649 --> 00:09:43,589
all the spider mite eggs you need to

240
00:09:42,298 --> 00:09:45,720
assume that you might not have gotten

241
00:09:43,589 --> 00:09:47,220
every last time for us it might so under

242
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:50,819
that theory there's no such thing as a

243
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:53,009
pest free crop beginning started early

244
00:09:50,818 --> 00:09:54,659
and preventive and having these things

245
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:56,369
in place is what prevents the

246
00:09:54,659 --> 00:09:59,578
infestation in the first place

247
00:09:56,369 --> 00:10:02,249
and for some pests hamper us it might is

248
00:09:59,578 --> 00:10:05,578
the main one that I use as an example on

249
00:10:02,249 --> 00:10:06,778
a scale of one to ten with one being one

250
00:10:05,578 --> 00:10:10,128
hem for us at night at my whole

251
00:10:06,778 --> 00:10:12,619
greenhouse and ten being oh my god I've

252
00:10:10,129 --> 00:10:15,869
closed the doors we're out of business

253
00:10:12,619 --> 00:10:18,689
anything past three we can't really do

254
00:10:15,869 --> 00:10:22,350
much about we can but it's gonna cost a

255
00:10:18,688 --> 00:10:24,469
lot of money so compress it might is the

256
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:26,970
main one that I use is the example like

257
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:28,399
at this point everybody's either had

258
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:30,809
them or they're at least aware of them

259
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,578
the people that did have them caught

260
00:10:30,808 --> 00:10:35,188
them too late the first time that's

261
00:10:32,578 --> 00:10:38,159
usually a pretty common thing and they

262
00:10:35,188 --> 00:10:40,228
saw what it cost them a good one to

263
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:42,358
compare it to in the ornamentals world

264
00:10:40,229 --> 00:10:45,538
is in poinsettias

265
00:10:42,359 --> 00:10:47,339
everybody talks about white fly the most

266
00:10:45,538 --> 00:10:48,568
that is the most prominent pest in

267
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:50,879
poinsettias it's where most of the

268
00:10:48,568 --> 00:10:52,438
research goes into a mite that doesn't

269
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:54,778
get as much coverage as a lot of other

270
00:10:52,438 --> 00:10:56,969
mites it's called the Lewis mite Lewis

271
00:10:54,778 --> 00:10:58,619
mite is a pest in poinsettias but the

272
00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:02,428
problem with Lewis mite and poinsettias

273
00:10:58,619 --> 00:11:05,939
it doesn't show damage until far long

274
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:08,038
after the feeding so you have to be

275
00:11:05,938 --> 00:11:10,498
attacking these Lewis mites very very

276
00:11:08,038 --> 00:11:12,149
early before you know that you have them

277
00:11:10,499 --> 00:11:15,899
before it looks like you have them no

278
00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:18,328
visual symptoms on the plants and the

279
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:19,948
thing is if you spray that when you cut

280
00:11:18,328 --> 00:11:21,808
if you find it early and you spray it

281
00:11:19,948 --> 00:11:23,849
you've now taken some of the sprays

282
00:11:21,808 --> 00:11:25,769
options out that you might need later

283
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:27,479
for white fly so that's a good example

284
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:29,459
right there of Lee you have to go in

285
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:31,709
preventively against this almost non

286
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:34,108
pest to keep your pest management

287
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:35,458
program in place down the road for your

288
00:11:34,109 --> 00:11:37,979
white fly if that makes sense

289
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:41,338
and yeah I want to highlight something

290
00:11:37,979 --> 00:11:43,049
you said back because this was new this

291
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:45,149
was new information to me within the

292
00:11:43,048 --> 00:11:46,048
last year I didn't realize that thrips

293
00:11:45,149 --> 00:11:47,938
can lay eggs

294
00:11:46,048 --> 00:11:50,399
inside the leaf so just because a plant

295
00:11:47,938 --> 00:11:52,379
looks clean even with really careful

296
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,820
scouting that quarantine room is super

297
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:57,720
important because thrips could still

298
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:59,490
show up for sure and that's the the

299
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:02,220
Western flower threats the mama

300
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:04,440
basically has almost like a little nice

301
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:06,960
that she just opens the lease and

302
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:09,690
oviposit sin there so now there's

303
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:12,420
there's I'm sure that they're highly

304
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:14,880
skilled entomologists with keen eyes out

305
00:12:12,419 --> 00:12:19,049
there that can spot what thrips eggs

306
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:21,600
inside of a leaf look like I can't I've

307
00:12:19,049 --> 00:12:23,669
never seen it that I can tell you with

308
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,129
certainty that's what that is on that

309
00:12:23,669 --> 00:12:28,439
leaf I don't know I know that I've seen

310
00:12:26,129 --> 00:12:32,580
thrips emerge out of leaves that looked

311
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:35,370
100% pest free to me so that's one right

312
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:37,680
there that even dipping you know I love

313
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:39,360
dips and I encourage anybody to get into

314
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:40,709
doing oil dips if you're bringing in a

315
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,019
lot of plant material that you just

316
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:45,750
don't know why take the chance

317
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:48,000
Suzanne is out there spreading the word

318
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:49,950
about it there's there's it's a lot of

319
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,470
info available now about it online

320
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:55,620
really have no excuse it's cheap just do

321
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:57,210
it but still know that you might not

322
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:59,310
have got thrips eggs that might be

323
00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:01,139
inside of the leaf strips are one that

324
00:12:59,309 --> 00:13:03,359
get overlooked in cannabis a lot because

325
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:06,179
they're not seen as as big of a pest as

326
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:09,480
spider mites or aphids or hemp russet

327
00:13:06,179 --> 00:13:12,719
might one thing I like to remind people

328
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:16,730
of thrips vector more pests more plant

329
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:19,110
viruses than any of those other bugs

330
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:21,300
taking the chance with the plant virus

331
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:23,250
if you I mean I think we're all starting

332
00:13:21,299 --> 00:13:26,459
to learn the impact that human viruses

333
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:27,870
have if you've ever seen a plant virus

334
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:30,030
move through a greenhouse or moved

335
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:33,210
through a room the devastation that that

336
00:13:30,029 --> 00:13:36,089
causes and I have been in a greenhouse

337
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:38,700
situation where my own negligence at

338
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:40,620
treating thrips in a crop that I that I

339
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:42,710
didn't think they were a problem in and

340
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:45,860
I'll say it's a crop called coleus

341
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:48,150
coleus are very colorful leaved plant

342
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:50,340
not a lot of flower production in a

343
00:13:48,149 --> 00:13:52,529
coleus thrips get on them they don't

344
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:54,720
really damage them I never saw what I

345
00:13:52,529 --> 00:13:57,149
considered significant thrips damage I

346
00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:00,740
wasn't asleep at the wheel on them I

347
00:13:57,149 --> 00:14:05,220
just wasn't prioritizing them as a pest

348
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:06,299
meanwhile they spread I nsv impatient

349
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:09,590
necrotic spot

350
00:14:06,299 --> 00:14:11,789
through that crop to the tune of about

351
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:16,290
$25,000 worth of plants by the end of

352
00:14:11,789 --> 00:14:18,719
the season stacked up plants wrapped

353
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:20,639
shrink wrapped in plastic because you

354
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,529
now have to dispose of them in a

355
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,419
different way because they are infected

356
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:26,100
and you have to dispose of plants that

357
00:14:24,419 --> 00:14:29,849
might not be infected but you just don't

358
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:32,970
know so that was from me not paying

359
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:34,649
attention to thrips so rip legs and the

360
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:37,379
leaves and it can really lead to

361
00:14:34,649 --> 00:14:38,850
problems down the road now I know that

362
00:14:37,379 --> 00:14:40,860
there's still a lot of research and a

363
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:44,190
lot of work being done to research this

364
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:46,560
this hopped latent thyroid and cannabis

365
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:49,350
and the jury's still out on if cannabis

366
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:51,419
get certain plant viruses but I mean why

367
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:53,430
wouldn't it that's the way I say it why

368
00:14:51,419 --> 00:14:57,479
wouldn't it why white why would we not

369
00:14:53,429 --> 00:14:58,979
assume that thrips that vector is to all

370
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,870
these other plants that they would be

371
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:04,320
that they wouldn't do the same to this

372
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:07,740
plant how do you you know for a while

373
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:10,830
there it seemed like every weird display

374
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:13,830
of stuff leaf damage was being called

375
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:17,190
tobacco mosaic virus but I've never seen

376
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:19,440
an actual pathology report confirming it

377
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:21,780
on cannabis and I think talking to

378
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,420
Suzanne she hadn't seen it either it's

379
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:26,129
always a buddy's friend that has the lab

380
00:15:24,419 --> 00:15:27,899
result you know but no one's ever been

381
00:15:26,129 --> 00:15:29,610
able to produce them yeah you haven't

382
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:32,069
seen him yet you seen it yet either no I

383
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:37,200
had I had one grow that I worked with

384
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:39,450
out in Bend Oregon that they I mean then

385
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:41,340
these guys it was such a tragedy because

386
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:44,550
the first time I visited their place I

387
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:46,590
told them I'm gonna brag about you guys

388
00:15:44,549 --> 00:15:49,169
to every grower I meet from now on and

389
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:51,420
and guilt-trip them for not having the

390
00:15:49,169 --> 00:15:55,500
same setup that you do I mean these guys

391
00:15:51,419 --> 00:15:57,719
had their PPE dialed in they had zip up

392
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:00,090
rubber doors between the rooms they had

393
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:02,580
maps in each room if you came in this

394
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:04,379
door you leave out of this door so there

395
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:06,540
was like a forced river there you

396
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:09,299
couldn't go back out the way you came in

397
00:16:06,539 --> 00:16:11,250
really cool guys and very talented very

398
00:16:09,299 --> 00:16:13,349
smart and look forward to working with

399
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:15,870
them and then about a month later the

400
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:19,110
guy sends me a picture of a plant that

401
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:19,860
looks like it has tmv and said is this

402
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:23,250
team

403
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:24,959
I don't know I was very honest with him

404
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:26,339
I only been working with cannabis for

405
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:27,479
about a year I said I'd really don't

406
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:29,850
know I have no idea what it would

407
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:32,159
display like in this crop and he said

408
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:36,329
well that plant looked beautiful

409
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:38,610
two days ago and I said I was out of

410
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:40,559
state at the time and I said I can't get

411
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:42,089
out there right now I could come like

412
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:43,559
Monday or whatever is as soon as I can

413
00:16:42,089 --> 00:16:45,329
get there so do me a favor send me a

414
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:47,518
picture that exact same plant tomorrow

415
00:16:45,328 --> 00:16:49,049
from the same angle and everything and

416
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:52,528
he did and somewhere I have those two

417
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:53,039
photos I put them side-by-side in one

418
00:16:52,528 --> 00:16:56,669
day

419
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:58,769
whatever that I I guess I probably won't

420
00:16:56,669 --> 00:17:00,870
ever know what it was it was definitely

421
00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:03,328
viral as I've never seen anything impact

422
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:06,568
a plant that fast not even spray I mean

423
00:17:03,328 --> 00:17:08,668
it was it was just it looked exactly

424
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:12,750
like tmv except it was starting at the

425
00:17:08,669 --> 00:17:14,910
top of the plants so I called this guy I

426
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:19,470
said look you need to get a test kit the

427
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:21,660
contest for tmv Insp tswv which is

428
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:23,730
tomato spotted wilt virus I mean

429
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:26,519
anything you can I ended up connecting

430
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:29,099
them with Ag dia which is the company

431
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:31,259
that produces the the test kits that we

432
00:17:29,099 --> 00:17:33,209
always used for years into greenhouses

433
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:35,730
it and these things aren't cheap they

434
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:36,750
had to pay fifteen hundred dollars to

435
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:39,900
get a box of them because they don't

436
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:42,480
sell just one so they tested all of

437
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:44,340
their suspect crops three tests and

438
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,620
negative for every one of the plant

439
00:17:44,339 --> 00:17:48,928
viruses meanwhile they lost about I

440
00:17:46,619 --> 00:17:51,719
don't know a hundred plants to whatever

441
00:17:48,929 --> 00:17:53,220
was going on there the nexus sometime

442
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,289
when we see each other again remind me

443
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:58,558
to show you the photos it's it's

444
00:17:55,289 --> 00:18:05,298
horrible it looks like it looked like

445
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:08,730
TMZ it was very decisively not tmv but

446
00:18:05,298 --> 00:18:09,990
out there yeah maybe there is I the only

447
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:12,450
thing I've ever seen

448
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:15,179
damaged plants that quickly and this is

449
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:19,529
this is an awful but yet kind of funny

450
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:22,769
story back in a day we were when I was I

451
00:18:19,529 --> 00:18:23,910
was growing outdoor with my my brother

452
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:26,579
and my father

453
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:29,519
I had taken a sprayer and filled it with

454
00:18:26,579 --> 00:18:32,139
bleach to bleach an old room that we had

455
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:34,210
been growing in in in a giant

456
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:37,660
garage warehouse on this property and

457
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:40,090
then my dad without me knowing

458
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:41,830
took that sprayer and it's like oh yeah

459
00:18:40,089 --> 00:18:43,929
I rinsed it out and then went and

460
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:45,849
sprayed I can't remember what it might

461
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:47,049
have been like neem oil or a compost tea

462
00:18:45,849 --> 00:18:50,319
I can't remember something out of that

463
00:18:47,049 --> 00:18:51,849
sprayer on do write plants and I came

464
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:54,909
out the next day and there was just like

465
00:18:51,849 --> 00:18:56,169
necrotic damage on the leaves and I

466
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:58,000
couldn't figure out what it was and

467
00:18:56,170 --> 00:19:01,029
literally over the course of three days

468
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,500
the entire crop was it was just gone it

469
00:19:01,029 --> 00:19:05,680
looked like the worst case of botrytis

470
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:08,319
you've ever seen just my brother is

471
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:09,880
still mad about it yeah I chalked it up

472
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:13,139
as a learning experience but it was I

473
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:15,550
mean these were this was a lot of plants

474
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:18,850
I'm not saying that's what they did but

475
00:19:15,549 --> 00:19:22,119
it was it was I was bad my probably

476
00:19:18,849 --> 00:19:23,709
biggest time of ruining ruining plants

477
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:25,449
from a mistake and it's funny because

478
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:28,180
it's actually something that I find

479
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:31,569
myself talking a lot about working in

480
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:34,480
cannabis is the dangers of a sulphur and

481
00:19:31,569 --> 00:19:36,009
oil treatment too close together which I

482
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,019
learned the hard way with a greenhouse

483
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:40,029
full of African violets which get

484
00:19:38,019 --> 00:19:43,139
powdery mildew like you wouldn't believe

485
00:19:40,029 --> 00:19:45,009
and I've had sold four burners in there

486
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:47,500
determined that I wasn't doing enough

487
00:19:45,009 --> 00:19:49,960
and did a very light micronized sulfur

488
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:53,650
spray and it wasn't five or six days

489
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:56,110
later that an oil spray was done I

490
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:58,120
didn't do the oil spray but I also

491
00:19:56,109 --> 00:20:02,099
didn't communicate with the person who

492
00:19:58,119 --> 00:20:04,239
did and and in his defense he he was

493
00:20:02,099 --> 00:20:05,740
still learning a lot and he didn't have

494
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:10,120
any idea about the interactions between

495
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:12,160
the two and yeah a lot of cannabis

496
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:16,389
growers have learned the hard way about

497
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:18,940
going after p.m. or Russ it might with

498
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:20,920
sulfur and oil and doing them within ten

499
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:22,360
days of each other I mean it's the

500
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:24,310
plants look probably about like your

501
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:28,619
your plants did they got hit with the

502
00:20:24,309 --> 00:20:30,700
bleach yeah it was so it was so rapid

503
00:20:28,619 --> 00:20:31,929
have a hemp press that question I know

504
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:34,480
were jumped around a little bit but I

505
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:36,670
had it I was on the phone with a grower

506
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,740
the other day and he was telling me that

507
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:41,410
he claims he got hemp Russ it from his

508
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:43,720
soil now I want to clarify not kiss soil

509
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:45,700
not my soil I have you don't wreck with

510
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:47,589
this grower just so I don't

511
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:49,149
people freaking out but alright he

512
00:20:47,589 --> 00:20:53,109
claimed that the hem press it can

513
00:20:49,148 --> 00:20:56,229
actually propagate in the soil which I

514
00:20:53,109 --> 00:20:58,750
thought it was exclusively a plant that

515
00:20:56,230 --> 00:21:01,950
lived or sorry an insect that lived in

516
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:06,788
the canopy and exclusive only to

517
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:08,139
cannabis or right what what about you I

518
00:21:06,788 --> 00:21:10,028
mean I'm open to being wrong here

519
00:21:08,138 --> 00:21:11,829
publicly off you're certainly here

520
00:21:10,028 --> 00:21:14,380
you're certainly right about it being

521
00:21:11,829 --> 00:21:17,230
exclusive to hemp in cannabis there are

522
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:19,750
other area Fayyad mites that at a glance

523
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:20,528
don't mean you wouldn't be able to tell

524
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:23,200
the difference

525
00:21:20,528 --> 00:21:24,429
most entomologist without slide mounting

526
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,720
them would not be able to tell the

527
00:21:24,429 --> 00:21:28,059
difference so there's a lot of mites

528
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:30,038
that look a lot like hand for us at

529
00:21:28,058 --> 00:21:32,470
mites that are not hem for us at mites

530
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:35,349
and one of the fun little things i play

531
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:37,028
with in my head sometimes is do we know

532
00:21:35,349 --> 00:21:39,099
that they only get him for us it might

533
00:21:37,028 --> 00:21:40,808
it could be a different one in there to

534
00:21:39,099 --> 00:21:43,148
a different area Fayed

535
00:21:40,808 --> 00:21:47,319
but trust moves we all know that one as

536
00:21:43,148 --> 00:21:52,298
as many as you need so they do all of

537
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:55,148
their feeding and they're there the

538
00:21:52,298 --> 00:21:58,089
lively part of their life on the leaves

539
00:21:55,148 --> 00:22:00,759
on the foliage feeding on the canopy of

540
00:21:58,089 --> 00:22:04,240
the plant now here's where the jury's

541
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:06,398
out since I'm sure you know and it's

542
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,798
been said many times that you know a

543
00:22:06,398 --> 00:22:11,229
hemp and cannabis exclusive test is

544
00:22:08,798 --> 00:22:13,179
going to have little to no official

545
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:16,179
research done on it

546
00:22:13,179 --> 00:22:17,860
the the actual University based studies

547
00:22:16,179 --> 00:22:19,659
and to have Russ it might are limited to

548
00:22:17,859 --> 00:22:22,298
a couple of things at Colorado State's

549
00:22:19,659 --> 00:22:24,639
put out so they haven't been studied at

550
00:22:22,298 --> 00:22:26,408
length to the level of something like a

551
00:22:24,638 --> 00:22:28,750
spider mite where we know a lot about

552
00:22:26,409 --> 00:22:31,389
the to spot spider mite you know so

553
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:36,159
we're the jury's out is the diapause

554
00:22:31,388 --> 00:22:38,888
part of their lifecycle so spider mites

555
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,510
do diapause into soil or if they have

556
00:22:38,888 --> 00:22:42,099
enough leaf litter if they can't get to

557
00:22:40,509 --> 00:22:47,158
good soil if you have enough leaflet or

558
00:22:42,099 --> 00:22:50,259
just you know just just soil litter

559
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:52,090
nobody really knows and I've had people

560
00:22:50,259 --> 00:22:55,298
tell me that they've had people tell

561
00:22:52,089 --> 00:22:55,778
them that oh yeah they died a pause in

562
00:22:55,298 --> 00:22:59,029
the soil

563
00:22:55,778 --> 00:23:02,180
the thing is area Fayyad mites

564
00:22:59,029 --> 00:23:04,039
that whole order of mites is a very to

565
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:05,990
use the same analogy to forts like a

566
00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:08,210
roulette wheel the ones that you can

567
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:09,319
find information on the full lifecycle

568
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:11,690
it doesn't help

569
00:23:09,319 --> 00:23:14,450
because some diapause on the plant

570
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:17,630
itself which that doesn't make sense on

571
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:18,920
an annual so if their diet pausing are

572
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:22,310
they going down into the soil to

573
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:25,430
diapause possibly but the only way that

574
00:23:22,309 --> 00:23:28,639
this grower would be getting area fired

575
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:31,310
my or hemp russet mites in purchased

576
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:35,030
soil is if he's purchasing the soil from

577
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:37,129
an old cannabis farm so they're not just

578
00:23:35,029 --> 00:23:39,680
going to be naturally occurring in soil

579
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:43,270
that's being sold and being amended and

580
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:45,710
all of that and sold as commercial soil

581
00:23:43,269 --> 00:23:47,450
there may be some sort of dormancy

582
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:49,490
period though where these are able to

583
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:53,420
survive potentially in the soil we just

584
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:56,450
don't know what we don't know that's the

585
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:58,220
thing we don't know and until until it's

586
00:23:56,450 --> 00:24:00,680
kind of like when people tell me that

587
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:02,210
they've seen hemp russet my eggs they're

588
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,470
like well we don't have them but I know

589
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:05,990
we have them because we found their eggs

590
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:07,460
I'm like take a picture and proves that

591
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:08,720
it sent for us it might eggs and you'll

592
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:10,700
make a lot of money off of it because

593
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:13,029
nobody has a picture of them nobody

594
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:15,620
knows what they look like really

595
00:24:13,029 --> 00:24:17,930
they haven't been studied on the degree

596
00:24:15,619 --> 00:24:21,519
that they need to be which is in a

597
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:24,200
laboratory or research greenhouse

598
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:26,119
university setting so until then

599
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,289
unfortunately people have a lot of

600
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:30,019
theories but at the end of the day

601
00:24:27,289 --> 00:24:32,480
they're just theories and the chances of

602
00:24:30,019 --> 00:24:34,579
you vectoring hemp for us it might in

603
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:38,779
any way except bringing them in on

604
00:24:34,579 --> 00:24:41,329
plants that you bought is very low in my

605
00:24:38,779 --> 00:24:43,129
opinion yes they can travel on gusts of

606
00:24:41,329 --> 00:24:46,759
wind yes they can get on your clothing

607
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:49,610
and then rub up against a plant can they

608
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:52,190
come in on other pests we don't know for

609
00:24:49,609 --> 00:24:55,819
sure but we know abroad might do so I

610
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:57,620
think that I've seen photos of citrus

611
00:24:55,819 --> 00:25:00,679
rust mite which is almost identical to

612
00:24:57,619 --> 00:25:03,529
two hemp russet might they jump off of

613
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:04,880
plants and they can't fly so I don't

614
00:25:03,529 --> 00:25:06,980
think they would jump off for any reason

615
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,180
except to either catch a wind current or

616
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:11,240
maybe catch a ride on it

617
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:12,769
who knows on a broad Mitel attached to a

618
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:14,120
white fly and

619
00:25:12,769 --> 00:25:18,230
let the whitefly take it to another

620
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:22,038
plant but with all of those potentials

621
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:23,690
yes they can do all of that I think 99%

622
00:25:22,038 --> 00:25:26,119
of the hemp rest of my cases we work

623
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:28,250
with I tell the people you bought these

624
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:30,408
you bought these we bought these plants

625
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:31,940
that they came in so like you know be

626
00:25:30,409 --> 00:25:36,380
aware that you were killing bugs that

627
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:40,070
you paid for yeah that's that's a good

628
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:41,419
way to put it one okay so I have a

629
00:25:40,069 --> 00:25:43,398
couple more questions for this podcast

630
00:25:41,419 --> 00:25:44,630
and I think I'd like to do just a

631
00:25:43,398 --> 00:25:45,829
separate follow-up one because I know

632
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:48,740
the thing that you want to talk about

633
00:25:45,829 --> 00:25:51,319
was the cannabis aphid and oh yeah and

634
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:53,720
and and it's just it's we've talked it

635
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:55,759
to death this year in the last couple of

636
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:57,140
years it's just one that I feel like it

637
00:25:55,759 --> 00:26:00,140
needs to be talked to death until

638
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:02,240
growers are terrified of it so they

639
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:04,549
actually stay on top of managing it a

640
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:07,759
hundred percent let's let's save that

641
00:26:04,548 --> 00:26:09,379
one and do another podcast here but I

642
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:11,000
did have a couple other questions that

643
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:13,539
kind of fit with this sort of Q&amp;A

644
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,599
podcast that we're doing right now so

645
00:26:13,538 --> 00:26:18,859
one of the things we talked about was

646
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:21,109
and because of Suzanne I always tell

647
00:26:18,859 --> 00:26:23,058
folks to work directly with an insect or

648
00:26:21,109 --> 00:26:24,168
go to an insect eree to make sure you're

649
00:26:23,058 --> 00:26:26,418
getting you know not only just good

650
00:26:24,169 --> 00:26:30,140
information as well as fresh bugs and

651
00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:32,390
can you talk a little bit about that

652
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:37,669
process or what your thoughts on are on

653
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:39,799
it yeah and and for sure you know when I

654
00:26:37,669 --> 00:26:41,899
used to buy a lot of bugs I would buy

655
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:43,668
through resellers and then occasionally

656
00:26:41,898 --> 00:26:48,259
when I was lucky and working directly

657
00:26:43,669 --> 00:26:49,759
with manufacturers now as times change

658
00:26:48,259 --> 00:26:52,190
we do change our business approach

659
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:54,710
sometimes and the truth is I mean we

660
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:57,980
have a really deadly smart good team of

661
00:26:54,710 --> 00:27:00,710
guys here but there's four of us and we

662
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:03,349
can't really get out and visit growers

663
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:06,069
all around the country so we do work

664
00:27:03,349 --> 00:27:08,629
with some distributors that usually are

665
00:27:06,069 --> 00:27:10,879
larger AG distributors that are selling

666
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:12,590
products that growers are already buying

667
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,090
already needed a lot of times they're

668
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:16,490
already set up with accounts with these

669
00:27:14,089 --> 00:27:18,288
companies that are providing stuff like

670
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:24,649
the conventional stuff that they will

671
00:27:18,288 --> 00:27:26,390
use fertilizers soil irrigation but one

672
00:27:24,648 --> 00:27:28,909
thing that we do is we try

673
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:30,440
- at least with these larger companies

674
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:33,110
that we're working with we're doing drop

675
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:36,410
shipping so when a grower works with

676
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:38,149
this rep who it may not disrupt that

677
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:40,700
they're working with may not work for us

678
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:45,320
they're providing our bugs directly from

679
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:47,750
our company so they do we ship them from

680
00:27:45,319 --> 00:27:49,220
our facility in Redding California to

681
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:51,799
you there's no middleman

682
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:54,259
so they're coming to you absolutely as

683
00:27:51,799 --> 00:28:00,470
fresh as possible most times within 24

684
00:27:54,259 --> 00:28:02,480
hours and also we try to work with these

685
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:04,250
distributors that are open to having us

686
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,960
come out and visit their growers with

687
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:08,180
them when we make time to visit

688
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:09,410
sometimes it's you know we have ones

689
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:12,259
that are working with growers in

690
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:15,080
Pennsylvania and Michigan Florida so

691
00:28:12,259 --> 00:28:16,609
when we visit out there we'll link up

692
00:28:15,079 --> 00:28:18,379
with these reps that are selling them

693
00:28:16,609 --> 00:28:21,169
our bugs and these other products and

694
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:23,090
say hey let's go visit so-and-so so that

695
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:26,330
way the grower still gets direct access

696
00:28:23,089 --> 00:28:28,099
to our specialists they have our contact

697
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:31,519
info they can reach out to us for

698
00:28:28,099 --> 00:28:33,919
technical support and stuff a lot of

699
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:35,619
times we have other we do have a few

700
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:37,940
other sellers that there is kind of a

701
00:28:35,619 --> 00:28:39,679
middleman person that they do keep a

702
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:41,930
separation between us and their

703
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:43,340
customers now most times companies like

704
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:44,810
that are going to be a lot more

705
00:28:43,339 --> 00:28:47,419
knowledgeable and biocontrol

706
00:28:44,809 --> 00:28:50,210
then say some of the bigger AG companies

707
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:52,940
because you have a rep who's pretty much

708
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:56,180
selling everything versus a rep who's

709
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:58,730
dedicated to biocontrol however those

710
00:28:56,180 --> 00:29:01,130
companies may not want a direct

711
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:02,900
relationship with suppliers and their

712
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:06,410
customers so we're kind of cut off from

713
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:09,170
them it is kind of at the end of the day

714
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:12,710
I just want you to buy our box I really

715
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:15,380
I want I want to as many people to get

716
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:17,410
our bugs into their greenhouses to their

717
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:20,330
grow rooms or to their farms as possible

718
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:24,380
it is kind of the growers decision if

719
00:29:20,329 --> 00:29:28,329
you want access with your reps with the

720
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:32,090
technical end of what we provide and

721
00:29:28,329 --> 00:29:33,439
potential visits to your location you

722
00:29:32,089 --> 00:29:35,089
need to be working with one of these

723
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:38,059
distributors it is getting it direct

724
00:29:35,089 --> 00:29:39,529
from us that is open to us visiting and

725
00:29:38,059 --> 00:29:40,210
you know the thing is these reps are

726
00:29:39,529 --> 00:29:43,240
also selling

727
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:45,370
bugs for other producers too and every

728
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:47,650
chance that they're probably working

729
00:29:45,369 --> 00:29:49,419
with them and visiting but that's that's

730
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:51,759
how we can connect with the growers and

731
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:54,850
it's how I'm not going to run our team

732
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:57,309
of four just completely ragged trying to

733
00:29:54,849 --> 00:30:00,519
work directly with every single grower

734
00:29:57,309 --> 00:30:02,529
that reaches out because it is it's it's

735
00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:06,220
it's a challenge there's a lot of

736
00:30:02,529 --> 00:30:08,200
support involved in what we do so the

737
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:10,779
key takeaway I think for people listen

738
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:12,420
this podcast is make sure the bugs are

739
00:30:10,779 --> 00:30:15,309
being shipped direct from insect erease

740
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:16,779
for sure and and that's just to make

741
00:30:15,309 --> 00:30:19,359
sure that they're as fresh as possible

742
00:30:16,779 --> 00:30:21,819
because now if you're if you're a four

743
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:23,679
by four tent or you know a few lights

744
00:30:21,819 --> 00:30:26,139
you may not have that option you may

745
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:30,519
only want a hundred 150 or something you

746
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:32,259
may have to go with you know someone

747
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:36,910
that's that's buying the bugs in as a

748
00:30:32,259 --> 00:30:41,230
middleman and then read distributing

749
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:43,450
them well or may not be as fresh exactly

750
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:45,940
unfortunately we only go down so small

751
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:49,330
and order sizes so sometimes the the

752
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:51,100
third party that is a good a good time

753
00:30:49,329 --> 00:30:53,019
for them to shine where they do they can

754
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:55,269
break things down into smaller units and

755
00:30:53,019 --> 00:30:57,400
and in their defense it's not like these

756
00:30:55,269 --> 00:30:58,900
are just getting shipped to some hot

757
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,830
warehouse where they're going to sit for

758
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:02,440
days

759
00:30:59,829 --> 00:31:03,939
most of these resellers have cold rooms

760
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:06,789
that they're doing all of the open

761
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:08,500
opening and repackaging in there so it's

762
00:31:06,789 --> 00:31:10,659
never coming out of that target

763
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:12,609
temperature the worst case is sometimes

764
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:15,759
you have an extra day in transit now the

765
00:31:12,609 --> 00:31:17,799
reality of all of this is to be

766
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:19,839
perfectly honest we sell some stuff that

767
00:31:17,799 --> 00:31:21,309
we don't produce some stuff that and and

768
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:23,230
that's the case with every producer

769
00:31:21,309 --> 00:31:25,179
don't let them tell you differently

770
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:27,460
we all buy and sell bugs to each other

771
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:30,970
at times so sometimes we are buying bugs

772
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:34,450
from Europe there are 6 days in transit

773
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:37,870
I used European bugs for years in my

774
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:39,309
greenhouses because the I wasn't even

775
00:31:37,869 --> 00:31:41,259
really producing a lot of greenhouse

776
00:31:39,309 --> 00:31:43,720
products back then B I was mainly doing

777
00:31:41,259 --> 00:31:45,759
lacewing and trikha grandma and a few

778
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:48,730
other things but no aureus no cuckoo

779
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:50,529
Marys nothing like that yet so I mean

780
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:52,660
for many many years everybody

781
00:31:50,529 --> 00:31:53,500
successfully did biocontrol with bugs

782
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:55,210
that were sick

783
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:58,839
today's and transit so it's not that

784
00:31:55,210 --> 00:32:00,519
it's not that extra Transit is going to

785
00:31:58,839 --> 00:32:02,349
impact the quality it's just you're

786
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:07,389
adding a lot more chances for something

787
00:32:02,349 --> 00:32:10,629
to go wrong and we do as much on our end

788
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:12,670
as we can these third-party resellers

789
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:15,190
are doing as much as they can by having

790
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:17,890
a cold room but we are totally at the

791
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:21,549
mercy of UPS and FedEx or whoever's

792
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:23,080
moving those bugs so the quicker the

793
00:32:21,549 --> 00:32:27,039
less time they have it the more

794
00:32:23,079 --> 00:32:30,220
comfortable I am yeah I know you and

795
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:31,930
Suzanna bull taught classes on how to

796
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:33,430
even evaluate the bugs that you are

797
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:36,670
receiving to know that they're viable

798
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:39,880
not just alive but actually going to go

799
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:42,340
out there and eat a target pest and

800
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:45,310
that's a whole other conversation in

801
00:32:42,339 --> 00:32:48,909
class and probably better done live in

802
00:32:45,309 --> 00:32:52,809
person but what I'm not I'm sorry good

803
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:55,210
oh go ahead just real quickly and it's

804
00:32:52,809 --> 00:32:57,690
it kind of plays into and and I will

805
00:32:55,210 --> 00:33:01,420
make it quick I just want to kind of a

806
00:32:57,690 --> 00:33:02,740
promotion for bi but we have been one

807
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:06,460
thing that we have been working on

808
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:08,589
during this downtime which is cool I had

809
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:10,630
developed a series of released

810
00:33:08,589 --> 00:33:13,000
instruction videos in the last year and

811
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:15,370
a half or so just kind of quick little

812
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,859
men and a half two minute long videos on

813
00:33:15,369 --> 00:33:20,589
our YouTube channel where growers can go

814
00:33:17,859 --> 00:33:22,899
if they get a bottle of what XYZ and say

815
00:33:20,589 --> 00:33:25,240
because we send printed instructions

816
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:28,120
with them but a lot of times it's just

817
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:29,920
so much easier to just watch 30 seconds

818
00:33:28,119 --> 00:33:31,569
of somebody actually using it to say

819
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:35,200
okay that's how I'm supposed to do that

820
00:33:31,569 --> 00:33:37,899
so one thing that we have recently been

821
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:40,150
adding during this downtime the Repsol

822
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:43,269
that i mentioned earlier he's bilingual

823
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:45,820
so we have gone and all of our videos we

824
00:33:43,269 --> 00:33:49,119
also now have available with Spanish

825
00:33:45,819 --> 00:33:50,169
audio over for spanish-speaking IPM

826
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:53,739
management which is something we're

827
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:57,160
running into a lot more often now so but

828
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:58,779
that plays into now that we've got

829
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:01,390
pretty much all of our release videos

830
00:33:58,779 --> 00:34:04,269
for our bugs done we're going to move

831
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:06,380
into the next project is a series of

832
00:34:04,269 --> 00:34:09,259
videos on scouting and

833
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:12,289
series of videos on QC of incoming bugs

834
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:14,600
of knowing what to look for all of that

835
00:34:12,289 --> 00:34:17,059
stuff so and moving forward now that we

836
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:19,069
have the gift of the of a bilingual

837
00:34:17,059 --> 00:34:21,549
specialist all of our videos will debut

838
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:23,990
in English and Spanish at the same time

839
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:25,970
hey that's great we'll put a link on the

840
00:34:23,989 --> 00:34:29,119
podcast page to the YouTube channel so

841
00:34:25,969 --> 00:34:32,269
people can check that out oh yeah what

842
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:36,049
bugs are you most famous for producing I

843
00:34:32,269 --> 00:34:37,460
wanted to cover that real quick i man

844
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:39,230
I'm probably speaking out of turn but I

845
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:40,519
thought I remembered it was 2 Khmer so

846
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:43,579
if you're on the west coast it's the

847
00:34:40,519 --> 00:34:46,610
fastest easiest way to get to Camaros is

848
00:34:43,579 --> 00:34:49,398
that right I would yeah if you're on the

849
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:50,628
west coast of the United States I don't

850
00:34:49,398 --> 00:34:51,440
see a way for you to get them quicker

851
00:34:50,628 --> 00:34:55,179
than us

852
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:57,740
I I would say VI is probably most known

853
00:34:55,179 --> 00:35:00,680
historically because just the eyes have

854
00:34:57,739 --> 00:35:05,299
been around for 35 years it's not until

855
00:35:00,679 --> 00:35:08,559
the last about 12 years that Cynthia our

856
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:11,390
owner expanded it out and she recruited

857
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:14,509
some people with a bigger emphasis in

858
00:35:11,389 --> 00:35:17,299
greenhouse products because for years bi

859
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:19,340
has been a huge producer of lacewing is

860
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:22,400
probably what we're known the best for

861
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:23,539
just because we I might be overstating

862
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,380
but we've got to be one of the largest

863
00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:28,550
producers in North America of lacewing

864
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:30,559
we produced a lot of turkey grandma

865
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:33,740
wasps which are used to control various

866
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:35,840
mods you know but as far as what the

867
00:35:33,739 --> 00:35:39,049
greenhouse is using these a lot of

868
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:40,760
lacewing in there but for me I really

869
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:44,900
fell in love with di when I found out

870
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:49,000
about our aureus aureus cuckoo Maris

871
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:52,309
strata Oh estradiol elapsed DeLucie

872
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:55,610
we have 10 or 12 organisms that we

873
00:35:52,309 --> 00:35:58,519
produce right here and reading that ship

874
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:59,420
out like you said I don't see a way for

875
00:35:58,519 --> 00:36:01,159
you to get them quicker

876
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:03,019
it's a no-knock against any other

877
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:04,969
company just they have to ship

878
00:36:03,019 --> 00:36:07,639
internationally to get them to you

879
00:36:04,969 --> 00:36:09,829
whereas you know you're up in the

880
00:36:07,639 --> 00:36:12,199
Seattle area of course today's Friday so

881
00:36:09,829 --> 00:36:14,150
it's an exception but you know Monday

882
00:36:12,199 --> 00:36:16,369
morning you call hey Kelly I've got a

883
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:18,349
real problem I need a I need some cuckoo

884
00:36:16,369 --> 00:36:19,849
marys bulk and I need some cuckoo Maris

885
00:36:18,349 --> 00:36:23,299
sachets

886
00:36:19,849 --> 00:36:25,309
you know the very longest it's going to

887
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:26,960
take you're in ham on Wednesday you call

888
00:36:25,309 --> 00:36:31,369
us early enough on Monday you might have

889
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:32,900
them on Tuesday so uh yeah that's and

890
00:36:31,369 --> 00:36:34,699
that's not even just because you're on

891
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:36,349
the west coast it could be you're in New

892
00:36:34,699 --> 00:36:38,569
York it's it's overnight shipping either

893
00:36:36,349 --> 00:36:40,159
way once we get it once we get it there

894
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:41,420
sometimes orders come in late in the day

895
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:44,960
we don't get the production into

896
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:48,409
shipping at time at that time now right

897
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:50,809
now things are day-to-day with the whole

898
00:36:48,409 --> 00:36:54,049
covert situation just because of all the

899
00:36:50,809 --> 00:36:55,309
shippers that we do use so a lot of

900
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:58,310
things I will just kind of put an

901
00:36:55,309 --> 00:37:02,029
asterisk on just as a commune

902
00:36:58,309 --> 00:37:05,059
just a cya type of situation right now

903
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:06,560
but so far we've had no issues with

904
00:37:05,059 --> 00:37:08,960
deliveries we've had no issues with our

905
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:12,079
shipments being impacted but of course

906
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:16,130
we're living in strange times but when

907
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:17,989
everything's running as normal yeah I

908
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:19,910
mean I ordered aureus the first time

909
00:37:17,989 --> 00:37:22,819
from beneficial and secretary and I got

910
00:37:19,909 --> 00:37:25,009
him the next day I was used to placing

911
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:28,250
orders on Thursday to get my bugs the

912
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:30,350
following Wednesday that's a game

913
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:33,010
changer you know because a lot of times

914
00:37:30,349 --> 00:37:35,929
in a green hot in a pest management

915
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:38,570
situation if you've been gone for a few

916
00:37:35,929 --> 00:37:40,129
days or you just didn't Scout that area

917
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:41,840
good enough and you come in and you say

918
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:45,200
oh my god look at these spider mites

919
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:48,920
I've got to do something in the next two

920
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:50,989
days if your bugs if we can't get bugs

921
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:52,789
to you in two days at the most

922
00:37:50,989 --> 00:37:54,109
all right you know if we can't get them

923
00:37:52,789 --> 00:37:55,489
to you any quicker than that you're

924
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:57,800
going to spray and then you're gonna

925
00:37:55,489 --> 00:38:00,019
nuke your bio control program so the

926
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:01,670
quicker that you can say I need to do

927
00:38:00,019 --> 00:38:04,190
something about that I can get bugs for

928
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:06,889
it and attack it that way instead of

929
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:10,429
setting everything back and starting

930
00:38:06,889 --> 00:38:11,809
again because I sprayed yeah I do want

931
00:38:10,429 --> 00:38:14,690
to highlight there are other insect

932
00:38:11,809 --> 00:38:16,039
erease out there beneficial is obviously

933
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:17,840
a great one

934
00:38:16,039 --> 00:38:20,300
you know you come highly recommended by

935
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:21,860
Suzanne there are and there's there's a

936
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:23,450
ton of different insect erease well not

937
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:25,910
a ton there's a limited amount of insect

938
00:38:23,449 --> 00:38:28,609
Ares in the world when you actually

939
00:38:25,909 --> 00:38:30,339
think about it and I would highlight

940
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:32,980
that there's a lot of different release

941
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:34,780
methods that all of these insect Ares

942
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:36,429
and that's probably a whole nother

943
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:38,140
conversation that's probably better done

944
00:38:36,429 --> 00:38:39,489
with visuals as well because there's

945
00:38:38,139 --> 00:38:42,190
pros and cons to all these different

946
00:38:39,489 --> 00:38:45,098
released you know sachets and bulk and

947
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:48,789
all of this stuff and I think once

948
00:38:45,099 --> 00:38:50,740
someone gets on a program that works for

949
00:38:48,789 --> 00:38:53,259
their facility and I want to talk I have

950
00:38:50,739 --> 00:38:55,868
a question for you around this in theory

951
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:59,560
you're not having to order these frantic

952
00:38:55,869 --> 00:39:01,119
you know orders last-minute and need him

953
00:38:59,559 --> 00:39:03,400
in two days it's it's nice that that's a

954
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:05,950
possibility but I know someone like

955
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:09,519
Justin has he has a standard order now

956
00:39:05,949 --> 00:39:11,679
and this works so he knows exactly when

957
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:14,739
he needs throughout the month to get

958
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:18,309
these bugs in there just to maintain his

959
00:39:14,739 --> 00:39:21,848
preventative IPM but my note on that

960
00:39:18,309 --> 00:39:23,949
would be on forums a lot of times or you

961
00:39:21,849 --> 00:39:25,240
know on Instagram social media media you

962
00:39:23,949 --> 00:39:27,279
see a lot of people like hey what's this

963
00:39:25,239 --> 00:39:29,399
bug and not only do you see a ton of

964
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:32,019
misidentification and misinformation

965
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:34,358
around biocontrol advice but let's say

966
00:39:32,019 --> 00:39:37,259
someone has you know a fan they say oh

967
00:39:34,358 --> 00:39:40,619
you need you need a Phidias or you need

968
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:43,630
you know lace wings or whatever that

969
00:39:40,619 --> 00:39:44,670
isn't enough information to get good

970
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:48,099
biocontrol

971
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:52,690
success and now I know one thing Suzanne

972
00:39:48,099 --> 00:39:54,369
has really like parked on me for is that

973
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:57,659
sounds bad one thing she's really

974
00:39:54,369 --> 00:39:59,588
drilled into my head is that every

975
00:39:57,659 --> 00:40:01,779
situation an environment and grow

976
00:39:59,588 --> 00:40:04,119
environment is unique and requires a

977
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:06,400
custom approach you can't you know these

978
00:40:04,119 --> 00:40:08,318
rates vary so dramatically based on

979
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,510
every situation because you highlighted

980
00:40:08,318 --> 00:40:12,699
there isn't a standard growing

981
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:15,010
methodology for cannabis like you would

982
00:40:12,699 --> 00:40:17,889
get with other crops so can you just

983
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:19,839
talk a little bit about that yeah well I

984
00:40:17,889 --> 00:40:22,779
mean especially I'm glad you used a fit

985
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:25,929
as an example because if it is the one

986
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:28,390
that uh I tell people like if you ask me

987
00:40:25,929 --> 00:40:30,279
one question about your aphids prepare

988
00:40:28,389 --> 00:40:33,009
for 20 out of me before I give you an

989
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:35,140
answer because the most important thing

990
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:37,510
is that what aphid is it that matters

991
00:40:35,139 --> 00:40:39,578
because if if we're gonna if we're

992
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:41,500
approaching let's say you're in a

993
00:40:39,579 --> 00:40:43,300
situation where you need to use wasps

994
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:45,940
it's critical to know what Jay said you

995
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:46,660
have or if you don't know which a lot of

996
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:47,679
growers don't and

997
00:40:46,659 --> 00:40:51,549
they don't have a way to get it

998
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:54,730
identified you know in their defense you

999
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:56,710
know Suzanne and and me and and I are

1000
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:58,869
big about get your bug ID if you don't

1001
00:40:56,710 --> 00:41:01,210
know what it is get it ID'd the reality

1002
00:40:58,869 --> 00:41:03,639
is I've sent bugs officer ID from my

1003
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:05,320
greenhouse and entomologist have work to

1004
00:41:03,639 --> 00:41:07,929
do so you get an idea about five weeks

1005
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:10,500
later four and a half weeks after you

1006
00:41:07,929 --> 00:41:13,509
sprayed because you had to do something

1007
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:15,940
but it is important to know which aphid

1008
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:19,180
you have with thrips too a lot of times

1009
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:20,829
I I it's a bad habit a lot of us have I

1010
00:41:19,179 --> 00:41:22,750
just say thrips I should say Western

1011
00:41:20,829 --> 00:41:24,400
flower thrips because what's true for

1012
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:26,230
Western flower thrips isn't always true

1013
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:28,210
for chili thrips or onion thrips or

1014
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:31,240
greenhouse thrips or a chi no thrips or

1015
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:34,780
cuban laurel threats or all the various

1016
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:36,909
ones so there's that for one you need to

1017
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:38,890
know that you're using the right species

1018
00:41:36,909 --> 00:41:40,899
to attack now in the case of like

1019
00:41:38,889 --> 00:41:42,609
lacewing larvae that's what I love about

1020
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:45,010
lacewing they don't care they're gonna

1021
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:47,260
eat aphids if they have access to them

1022
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:48,790
but are you in a situation where

1023
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:52,930
lacewing might not be a good approach

1024
00:41:48,789 --> 00:41:54,309
and then you have to use wasps you can

1025
00:41:52,929 --> 00:41:55,750
release both and know that you're

1026
00:41:54,309 --> 00:41:57,880
controlling it but if you know which

1027
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:59,949
aphid you have if you know for a fact

1028
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:02,470
that you have a green peach aphid

1029
00:41:59,949 --> 00:42:04,839
there's no need to release a phidias ERV

1030
00:42:02,469 --> 00:42:06,759
I which are expensive you can release a

1031
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:10,150
phidias coleman coal money which are not

1032
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:12,430
as expensive if you don't get that aphid

1033
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:13,450
Aidid you got to release both if you

1034
00:42:12,429 --> 00:42:16,210
want to know that you're covering your

1035
00:42:13,449 --> 00:42:19,989
butt and then another example of like I

1036
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:22,659
said maybe you want to use Faust's now

1037
00:42:19,989 --> 00:42:24,849
this is this is uh this is something

1038
00:42:22,659 --> 00:42:27,519
that I have observed in the field quite

1039
00:42:24,849 --> 00:42:29,920
a lot in the last few years a couple of

1040
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:32,530
the guys at work have also made similar

1041
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:34,539
observations so a lot of times I like to

1042
00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:36,450
start with a disclaimer I'm not making a

1043
00:42:34,539 --> 00:42:39,579
scientific statement that I have

1044
00:42:36,449 --> 00:42:41,469
research to show this it's just field

1045
00:42:39,579 --> 00:42:43,119
observations and feedback from our

1046
00:42:41,469 --> 00:42:47,889
growers but one thing that I'm starting

1047
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:49,900
to notice in cannabis and hemp and not

1048
00:42:47,889 --> 00:42:52,210
just cannabis and hemp any plant that in

1049
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:55,000
its late pubescent stage gets these

1050
00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:58,079
heavy trichomes a good example in the

1051
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,809
ornamentals world would be petunias or

1052
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:02,210
just greenhouse

1053
00:42:59,809 --> 00:43:04,070
tomatoes is a good example as well where

1054
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:04,699
if you're familiar with the lacewing

1055
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:07,220
larva

1056
00:43:04,699 --> 00:43:09,349
with its anatomy and they look like

1057
00:43:07,219 --> 00:43:12,049
little alligators with six legs kinda

1058
00:43:09,349 --> 00:43:13,339
they're kind of dragging their belly on

1059
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:15,830
the ground when they walk and they

1060
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:17,900
they're not exactly small they do like

1061
00:43:15,829 --> 00:43:20,420
to get into tight areas and feed but

1062
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:22,550
they don't seem to really they're not

1063
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:24,470
thrilled about going into areas of

1064
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:27,019
hugely dense trichomes that they

1065
00:43:24,469 --> 00:43:28,609
obviously have trouble navigating so if

1066
00:43:27,019 --> 00:43:31,070
you have an aphid issue on a plant

1067
00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:32,750
that's a week seven of flower throwing

1068
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:34,730
lacewing larvae and it might not be the

1069
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:38,119
right approach so then then it is

1070
00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:39,800
critical to know that's not the answer

1071
00:43:38,119 --> 00:43:42,109
that's not going to work we need to do

1072
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:44,330
wasps and then which wasps do we need to

1073
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:45,620
do white flies another good one why it's

1074
00:43:44,329 --> 00:43:46,929
why you need to know which white fly to

1075
00:43:45,619 --> 00:43:49,969
know that you're using the right

1076
00:43:46,929 --> 00:43:51,619
parasitoid for it so anybody that just

1077
00:43:49,969 --> 00:43:53,089
comes on a forum and says hey what do I

1078
00:43:51,619 --> 00:43:55,940
do about Athens and somebody gives them

1079
00:43:53,090 --> 00:44:00,740
an answer they really didn't ask enough

1080
00:43:55,940 --> 00:44:02,630
questions almost any almost any

1081
00:44:00,739 --> 00:44:06,739
situation I need to know what stage the

1082
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:09,280
plants in what you're growing you know

1083
00:44:06,739 --> 00:44:11,419
if it's if it's something like thrips

1084
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:13,010
you know it's important to know are you

1085
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:15,320
a hydroponic growers because if you are

1086
00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:17,980
then we can't be putting strategy laps

1087
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:23,720
in the soil that you don't have you know

1088
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:25,309
so uh forums forums and social media and

1089
00:44:23,719 --> 00:44:28,099
I used to belong to a lot of different

1090
00:44:25,309 --> 00:44:30,199
insect ID groups on Facebook and I just

1091
00:44:28,099 --> 00:44:32,719
got so frustrated because it's assault

1092
00:44:30,199 --> 00:44:35,149
like and it's funny I I tease Suzanne

1093
00:44:32,719 --> 00:44:37,389
about this she spends 90% of her time

1094
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:39,950
online just having to go in and just

1095
00:44:37,389 --> 00:44:41,659
correct all of this bad info and it's

1096
00:44:39,949 --> 00:44:46,399
great that people are out there doing it

1097
00:44:41,659 --> 00:44:47,960
it's just exhausting for me and at the

1098
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,940
end of the day when there's no research

1099
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:52,369
to back up some of this stuff you get to

1100
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:54,710
a point where I can say everything I

1101
00:44:52,369 --> 00:44:57,019
just said but the next guy can come in

1102
00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:58,519
and say something and I can't prove them

1103
00:44:57,019 --> 00:45:00,800
wrong and they can't prove me wrong and

1104
00:44:58,519 --> 00:45:02,929
then it's like it's like when you go on

1105
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:04,820
reddit looking for an answer to

1106
00:45:02,929 --> 00:45:06,559
something and you read this long

1107
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:08,260
response and it's like huh that guy

1108
00:45:06,559 --> 00:45:10,159
sounds like they're really making sense

1109
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:11,810
that's probably the right answer and

1110
00:45:10,159 --> 00:45:13,409
then you read the very next one and

1111
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:16,500
you're like oh wait a minute that one

1112
00:45:13,409 --> 00:45:18,869
makes sense too so it's it's a little

1113
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:21,599
Wild West in that area but anybody that

1114
00:45:18,869 --> 00:45:23,940
says what do I do for a Fitz hey just

1115
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:25,710
throw ladybugs at them you didn't put

1116
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:28,679
enough thought into it and chances are

1117
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:30,840
it's not gonna work yeah I want to say

1118
00:45:28,679 --> 00:45:34,019
that timing also is important an

1119
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:36,059
application rate and environment in

1120
00:45:34,019 --> 00:45:38,190
terms of your your lighting your

1121
00:45:36,059 --> 00:45:40,170
humidity or your temperatures can all

1122
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:42,480
play a role so it's really important I

1123
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:44,369
think that people get a program that's

1124
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:45,840
really customized to them and I know

1125
00:45:44,369 --> 00:45:47,789
you've mentioned ladybugs a couple times

1126
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:49,500
I just want to make sure if you're

1127
00:45:47,789 --> 00:45:50,849
thinking about buying ladybugs please go

1128
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:52,679
back and listen to the last podcast

1129
00:45:50,849 --> 00:45:55,139
because there's a lot of challenges

1130
00:45:52,679 --> 00:45:58,259
around these wild harvested ladybugs and

1131
00:45:55,139 --> 00:46:00,480
like yeah I I hope people aren't

1132
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:03,900
purchasing those I know there are some

1133
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:06,210
insect or insect or reared ladybugs but

1134
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:08,730
it's really rare and that's not what 99%

1135
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:10,079
of the population and and most times and

1136
00:46:08,730 --> 00:46:12,449
they're not the ones you're going to be

1137
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:14,369
buying at a grow shop either the

1138
00:46:12,449 --> 00:46:16,619
insectary reared lady beetles are not

1139
00:46:14,369 --> 00:46:18,599
the traditional ones that most people

1140
00:46:16,619 --> 00:46:20,759
think of when they say ladybug these are

1141
00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:23,719
ones that are specialized for going

1142
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:25,920
after different pests like mealy bugs or

1143
00:46:23,719 --> 00:46:28,739
even one there is one that goes after

1144
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:30,809
spider mites but not the ones that

1145
00:46:28,739 --> 00:46:32,669
you're buying at a grow shop those as

1146
00:46:30,809 --> 00:46:34,920
you said wild harvest it's one of those

1147
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:37,200
things that if there's something to get

1148
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:38,880
up on a soapbox about that's one and

1149
00:46:37,199 --> 00:46:41,189
that's that's my soapbox thing that I

1150
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:43,110
get up on it's like look ladybugs

1151
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:45,150
showing up on their own or your friend

1152
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:46,740
you don't need to you don't need to

1153
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:48,269
worry you're not hurting anybody by

1154
00:46:46,739 --> 00:46:50,849
letting them come and hang out in your

1155
00:46:48,269 --> 00:46:53,009
garden or on your crop but buying them

1156
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:55,980
is just it's kind of spitting in the

1157
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:58,260
face of sustainability in my opinion

1158
00:46:55,980 --> 00:47:00,449
it's taking them out of we're taking

1159
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:02,640
them out of where we need them I just

1160
00:47:00,449 --> 00:47:05,339
wanted to clarify that just to make sure

1161
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:07,799
growers weren't buying any any ladybirds

1162
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:10,230
or anything like that yeah I'm not gonna

1163
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:13,800
scream at you for it but I might wag my

1164
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:16,289
finger at you a little bit yeah cool

1165
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:19,260
well one other thing I wanted to cover

1166
00:47:16,289 --> 00:47:20,849
real quick was talking about your staff

1167
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:21,900
and how you guys work with the grower

1168
00:47:20,849 --> 00:47:23,519
because we just talked about the

1169
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:24,990
importance of a customized approach you

1170
00:47:23,519 --> 00:47:26,280
mentioned a little bit that some of

1171
00:47:24,989 --> 00:47:29,000
these

1172
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:31,980
some of these distributors will allow

1173
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:34,619
you and your staff to come in and you

1174
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:36,240
know maybe even to her greenhouse or to

1175
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:37,590
our facility or work directly with the

1176
00:47:36,239 --> 00:47:39,299
grower and coming up with a program

1177
00:47:37,590 --> 00:47:41,100
you're still buying the bugs through the

1178
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:44,820
distributor you're not selling direct

1179
00:47:41,099 --> 00:47:46,440
but how do how do people interact with

1180
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:48,510
your staff and let's do a quick little

1181
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:49,829
bio about the four people that they may

1182
00:47:48,510 --> 00:47:51,750
interact with over a beneficiary

1183
00:47:49,829 --> 00:47:54,119
beneficial because I've met them all you

1184
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:56,670
guys are all great guys let's take a

1185
00:47:54,119 --> 00:48:00,269
nominator and plug that yeah I've got a

1186
00:47:56,670 --> 00:48:02,309
great team to that well I guess three

1187
00:48:00,269 --> 00:48:04,349
kind of the numbers all of them I'm kind

1188
00:48:02,309 --> 00:48:07,108
of had a hand in getting them on board

1189
00:48:04,349 --> 00:48:07,789
here Greg Greg Bryant he lives in

1190
00:48:07,108 --> 00:48:11,549
Colorado

1191
00:48:07,789 --> 00:48:15,170
Greg joined up with us around the summer

1192
00:48:11,550 --> 00:48:18,269
last year a year before I'm sorry and

1193
00:48:15,170 --> 00:48:20,400
Greg actually came to us from one of our

1194
00:48:18,269 --> 00:48:23,969
competitors so he had a little bit of

1195
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:26,849
experience already in doing exactly what

1196
00:48:23,969 --> 00:48:29,819
we do and prior to that had experience

1197
00:48:26,849 --> 00:48:33,358
working with nematode colonies and did

1198
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:35,369
he did work in efficacy trials with

1199
00:48:33,358 --> 00:48:37,559
pesticides and greenhouses and stuff so

1200
00:48:35,369 --> 00:48:41,700
he's got a really cool entomology

1201
00:48:37,559 --> 00:48:45,389
background and then we have Sol Alba

1202
00:48:41,699 --> 00:48:48,449
who's down in Los Angeles Sol is the one

1203
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:50,819
who was about 15 minutes into the first

1204
00:48:48,449 --> 00:48:53,159
time I visited him as a grower you know

1205
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:54,359
as a supplier customer relationship I

1206
00:48:53,159 --> 00:48:56,639
asked him if he'd ever think about

1207
00:48:54,358 --> 00:48:59,279
coming to work for us and in about two

1208
00:48:56,639 --> 00:49:00,599
years later he he finally took me up on

1209
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:03,690
my offer

1210
00:49:00,599 --> 00:49:06,329
Sol is licensed PCA in the state of

1211
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:08,460
California he's got IPM hands-on

1212
00:49:06,329 --> 00:49:11,639
experience in large green house cannabis

1213
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:14,090
which is and actually he when I first

1214
00:49:11,639 --> 00:49:18,079
met him he was working in organic herbs

1215
00:49:14,090 --> 00:49:20,700
he's grown done IPM and mushrooms and

1216
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:22,679
vineyards and worked in wine chemistry

1217
00:49:20,699 --> 00:49:27,000
before that so he's got a really create

1218
00:49:22,679 --> 00:49:30,899
an incredible background of chemical and

1219
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:33,929
and macro biological plus the licensed

1220
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:35,490
PCA part not that we sell insecticides

1221
00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:36,989
that it's good to have someone license

1222
00:49:35,489 --> 00:49:38,489
to consult in it because we can go a

1223
00:49:36,989 --> 00:49:38,949
little deeper in working with growers

1224
00:49:38,489 --> 00:49:40,959
that are

1225
00:49:38,949 --> 00:49:43,088
coming off of conventional programs and

1226
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:45,970
getting them more towards chemistry

1227
00:49:43,088 --> 00:49:49,088
that's a little friendlier to what we do

1228
00:49:45,969 --> 00:49:52,239
and then our most recent addition to the

1229
00:49:49,088 --> 00:49:53,980
team is Eric Vanderslice he lives up in

1230
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:57,909
the Portland area

1231
00:49:53,980 --> 00:50:00,849
Eric was I knew him as IPM manager from

1232
00:49:57,909 --> 00:50:02,980
another very large ornamentals

1233
00:50:00,849 --> 00:50:04,660
greenhouse operation up there very

1234
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:06,070
similar to the one that I worked for in

1235
00:50:04,659 --> 00:50:10,629
fact the two companies did business

1236
00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:12,400
together but prior to that Eric is one

1237
00:50:10,630 --> 00:50:16,210
of the weird ones that he crossed over

1238
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:18,880
from cannabis into ornamentals not the

1239
00:50:16,210 --> 00:50:22,088
other way around because he had a couple

1240
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:26,500
years as head grower for large cannabis

1241
00:50:22,088 --> 00:50:28,690
operation in Washington so our team is

1242
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:30,460
just full of this diverse background of

1243
00:50:28,690 --> 00:50:33,519
experience so that's I just had to do a

1244
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:35,170
little bragging about them the way

1245
00:50:33,519 --> 00:50:36,969
generally that they'll work with us it

1246
00:50:35,170 --> 00:50:38,530
depends if you know like the show that

1247
00:50:36,969 --> 00:50:40,118
we did in Portland where I saw you last

1248
00:50:38,530 --> 00:50:42,040
a lot of times we meet people we get

1249
00:50:40,119 --> 00:50:45,369
their information there and we'll reach

1250
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:48,009
out to them get them connected with who

1251
00:50:45,369 --> 00:50:50,650
they need to to get orders placed and

1252
00:50:48,010 --> 00:50:52,180
then if it's someone within driving

1253
00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:54,250
distance of course we get out there as

1254
00:50:52,179 --> 00:50:56,559
soon as possible if it's someone that's

1255
00:50:54,250 --> 00:51:00,429
in a different part of the country that

1256
00:50:56,559 --> 00:51:01,690
we do have other area other stuff that

1257
00:51:00,429 --> 00:51:04,059
we work at there you know

1258
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:06,838
personally I like to try to get a visit

1259
00:51:04,059 --> 00:51:09,219
to the place as soon as possible because

1260
00:51:06,838 --> 00:51:11,679
just like I said with the release videos

1261
00:51:09,219 --> 00:51:13,868
sometimes it takes 30 minutes for me to

1262
00:51:11,679 --> 00:51:16,899
explain something that takes 30 seconds

1263
00:51:13,869 --> 00:51:18,730
to show you sometimes like if I've had

1264
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:21,190
growers that I've worked with for a year

1265
00:51:18,730 --> 00:51:23,108
or two years and never seen their

1266
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:24,760
facility and then somehow something

1267
00:51:23,108 --> 00:51:26,199
happens where I get a chance and you go

1268
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:28,150
out there and you're like oh this is not

1269
00:51:26,199 --> 00:51:29,889
what I it's like when you're reading a

1270
00:51:28,150 --> 00:51:31,329
book and then you watch the movie and

1271
00:51:29,889 --> 00:51:33,879
they don't look anything like you

1272
00:51:31,329 --> 00:51:35,740
expected them to some growers are really

1273
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:37,480
bad at explaining I'm not just blaming

1274
00:51:35,739 --> 00:51:38,979
the growers but some are really bad at

1275
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:41,318
explaining what their greenhouses or

1276
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:42,760
their rooms look like or what they don't

1277
00:51:41,318 --> 00:51:45,940
know their own square footage a lot of

1278
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:50,650
times so just me putting eyes on it one

1279
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:52,760
time helps now with with kovat and and

1280
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:54,530
our travel being very limited right now

1281
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:57,530
trying to encourage more growers to be a

1282
00:51:54,530 --> 00:51:59,390
little active in sending us photos that

1283
00:51:57,530 --> 00:52:01,310
works that that works better than

1284
00:51:59,389 --> 00:52:03,109
explaining it to us sometimes just walk

1285
00:52:01,309 --> 00:52:05,360
around take about 20 photos of your

1286
00:52:03,110 --> 00:52:06,860
location send them to me and tell me

1287
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:08,809
which one is green house a and green

1288
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:13,039
house B or green house 21 and green

1289
00:52:08,809 --> 00:52:15,949
house 22 and then that way I have in my

1290
00:52:13,039 --> 00:52:17,480
photos I have folders for each of the

1291
00:52:15,949 --> 00:52:19,549
customers that I visited that I put the

1292
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:21,769
photos in there from so it's like if if

1293
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:23,510
CAD calls me and he's got an issue and

1294
00:52:21,769 --> 00:52:25,219
go and see what Tad's a green house

1295
00:52:23,510 --> 00:52:28,040
looks like because the sad truth is

1296
00:52:25,219 --> 00:52:29,439
after four years of working here it gets

1297
00:52:28,039 --> 00:52:31,550
hard to remember a lot of them sometimes

1298
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:33,769
it's hard to even wrap my head around

1299
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:37,160
how many places I visited at this point

1300
00:52:33,769 --> 00:52:38,690
but the sooner we can get a visit the

1301
00:52:37,159 --> 00:52:40,519
better sometimes that doesn't work out

1302
00:52:38,690 --> 00:52:44,510
if we can get photos and get growers

1303
00:52:40,519 --> 00:52:45,920
started a lot of times growers it's how

1304
00:52:44,510 --> 00:52:47,300
much they want to share with us if

1305
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:49,940
they're willing to share stuff like a

1306
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:51,950
production schedule with us we can get

1307
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:54,079
them going like your friend Justin we're

1308
00:52:51,949 --> 00:52:55,460
okay we know when you're gonna plant

1309
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:57,799
when you're going to harvest we know

1310
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:59,240
when the plants are switching when

1311
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:01,310
they're going to be transplanted we can

1312
00:52:59,239 --> 00:53:04,279
lay out some groundwork right here and

1313
00:53:01,309 --> 00:53:06,259
then there's no such thing as a

1314
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:07,820
subscription biocontrol there's no set

1315
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:10,640
it and forget it you can set up certain

1316
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:13,700
things like sachets releases of strata

1317
00:53:10,639 --> 00:53:15,230
flike that we still in my opinion I

1318
00:53:13,699 --> 00:53:16,759
think it's like you got to go to the

1319
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:18,559
doctor for a check-up we have to check

1320
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:20,780
up every now and then and just touch

1321
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:23,840
base you might have certain cultivars to

1322
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:26,030
give a little bit of pest pressure but

1323
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:28,550
you know most of the time we're just a

1324
00:53:26,030 --> 00:53:30,740
phone call away we do travel a lot so

1325
00:53:28,550 --> 00:53:32,780
sometimes run available immediately that

1326
00:53:30,739 --> 00:53:35,479
we all will get back with you within 24

1327
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:39,080
hours of an email or text or phone call

1328
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:41,480
coming in you know that's a good point

1329
00:53:39,079 --> 00:53:43,369
you're constantly tweaking your program

1330
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:45,320
it's never a set it and forget it is

1331
00:53:43,369 --> 00:53:48,139
something that's always being you know

1332
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:50,780
adapt to a given you know your given

1333
00:53:48,139 --> 00:53:52,339
situation seasonally you get better over

1334
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:55,670
time you get better at just kind of

1335
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:57,890
knowing what you need and some things

1336
00:53:55,670 --> 00:53:59,389
are pretty much set it and forget it

1337
00:53:57,889 --> 00:54:02,179
like you can Pro you can you can

1338
00:53:59,389 --> 00:54:04,579
forecast out nematode drenches or like I

1339
00:54:02,179 --> 00:54:05,500
said strata or lay lapse releases if you

1340
00:54:04,579 --> 00:54:08,739
know you're going to have

1341
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:10,780
amount of plants but as far as pest

1342
00:54:08,739 --> 00:54:12,429
pressure goes you're not going to have

1343
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:14,860
consistent spider mite pressure

1344
00:54:12,429 --> 00:54:18,250
throughout the entire crop consistent

1345
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:20,079
thrips pressure so you have to but for a

1346
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:23,230
certain amount of it it can be set up

1347
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:25,329
ahead of time and then it's like you

1348
00:54:23,230 --> 00:54:26,800
know you you go out and you scout which

1349
00:54:25,329 --> 00:54:28,599
everybody should be doing whether you're

1350
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:30,310
on a subscription biocontrol or

1351
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:32,349
subscription spray or whatever you're

1352
00:54:30,309 --> 00:54:35,650
doing you need to be scouting you scout

1353
00:54:32,349 --> 00:54:37,599
and you say you know what sometimes if

1354
00:54:35,650 --> 00:54:39,220
you're doing really good you can reduce

1355
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:42,599
what you were going to buy you know what

1356
00:54:39,219 --> 00:54:45,699
I don't need that extra blah blah blah

1357
00:54:42,599 --> 00:54:47,710
sometimes you say oh well that new

1358
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:49,929
strain that we have is really getting

1359
00:54:47,710 --> 00:54:52,300
hit by spider mites so we need to tack

1360
00:54:49,929 --> 00:54:55,899
on an extra bottle of personalist to

1361
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:57,039
push those back so for the most part

1362
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:58,930
we're never done

1363
00:54:57,039 --> 00:55:00,519
communicating with the grower I mean

1364
00:54:58,929 --> 00:55:04,179
they're never going to be done having

1365
00:55:00,519 --> 00:55:05,380
pest pest challenges and I mean we do we

1366
00:55:04,179 --> 00:55:06,789
have some growers that they can't even

1367
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:08,500
place an order without calling and

1368
00:55:06,789 --> 00:55:08,889
talking to us and that's what we're here

1369
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:12,219
for

1370
00:55:08,889 --> 00:55:13,690
you know to support them yeah you know

1371
00:55:12,219 --> 00:55:16,119
you had your soapbox moment around

1372
00:55:13,690 --> 00:55:17,829
ladybugs or lady beetles and I want to

1373
00:55:16,119 --> 00:55:20,619
have a quick one around what you just

1374
00:55:17,829 --> 00:55:22,599
what you just mentioned cuz I get I get

1375
00:55:20,619 --> 00:55:24,219
blurry photos and videos all the time of

1376
00:55:22,599 --> 00:55:26,799
insects let me just start off by saying

1377
00:55:24,219 --> 00:55:28,929
I am NOT going to identify your insect I

1378
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:30,970
don't I'm not a pathologist I don't have

1379
00:55:28,929 --> 00:55:33,159
enough experience I know what I write no

1380
00:55:30,969 --> 00:55:34,929
I mean I can guess I'm pretty good at

1381
00:55:33,159 --> 00:55:36,909
that but I'm not gonna do that for your

1382
00:55:34,929 --> 00:55:39,609
girl it's just not right it wouldn't be

1383
00:55:36,909 --> 00:55:41,019
ethical of me but I would write happily

1384
00:55:39,610 --> 00:55:43,360
refer you to someone like Suzanne

1385
00:55:41,019 --> 00:55:44,920
someone like Kelli and they can identify

1386
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:47,170
but they're not gonna be lied enta PHY

1387
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:49,930
awful happy you know 90% of the images I

1388
00:55:47,170 --> 00:55:52,720
get are not high enough resolution check

1389
00:55:49,929 --> 00:55:54,849
and identification and that's so invest

1390
00:55:52,719 --> 00:55:56,799
in something I know Suzanne loves Dino

1391
00:55:54,849 --> 00:55:58,269
lights I have a Dino light I love it I

1392
00:55:56,800 --> 00:56:00,250
don't want to sound like they're the

1393
00:55:58,269 --> 00:56:01,929
only things that take a good measure cuz

1394
00:56:00,250 --> 00:56:04,480
that's you know what

1395
00:56:01,929 --> 00:56:06,639
years ago though I gave up on trying to

1396
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:09,280
not sound like a marketing Dino light

1397
00:56:06,639 --> 00:56:11,289
because they're they're so easy to find

1398
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:13,660
there's so many other ones out there

1399
00:56:11,289 --> 00:56:15,730
that but I have bought the other ones

1400
00:56:13,659 --> 00:56:18,369
and it's really a crapshoot of quality

1401
00:56:15,730 --> 00:56:19,460
whereas again I don't get paid by Dino

1402
00:56:18,369 --> 00:56:21,230
life I don't think you

1403
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:22,610
do I know I don't think Suzanne does

1404
00:56:21,230 --> 00:56:25,820
they really just are

1405
00:56:22,610 --> 00:56:27,500
it's like DRAM Auto foggers I don't get

1406
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:30,320
paid by them I just want to tell you

1407
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:32,389
what the best one to use is I do sell

1408
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:36,170
Dino lights now because of Suzanne so I

1409
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:38,299
do not very smell origin but I do I do

1410
00:56:36,170 --> 00:56:41,090
carry him now yeah dude they're they're

1411
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:43,250
they're indispensable I mean nobody has

1412
00:56:41,090 --> 00:56:46,070
an excuse to not have one at this point

1413
00:56:43,250 --> 00:56:50,360
there you can get the dynamite basic is

1414
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:52,280
like 125 bucks at the most I mean what

1415
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:53,870
is your crop worth to you one plant is

1416
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:56,870
worth I mean that's a fraction of what

1417
00:56:53,869 --> 00:56:59,000
you make off one plant so I have a slide

1418
00:56:56,869 --> 00:57:01,279
that I do and a lot of talks just called

1419
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:03,619
help me help you and I use it as a

1420
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:05,600
collage of all of the just atrocious

1421
00:57:03,619 --> 00:57:07,969
pictures that I've gotten sent where

1422
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:09,529
it's like dude I have no idea what I'm

1423
00:57:07,969 --> 00:57:12,019
looking at I can't tell us that's a

1424
00:57:09,530 --> 00:57:15,110
might or an asset or if it's even a

1425
00:57:12,019 --> 00:57:16,730
plant you know so but there's someone

1426
00:57:15,110 --> 00:57:19,070
that will identify that for you on a

1427
00:57:16,730 --> 00:57:20,719
forum confident of course it's a

1428
00:57:19,070 --> 00:57:26,120
renascent thank you

1429
00:57:20,719 --> 00:57:29,359
now I'm trying to use kovat as a little

1430
00:57:26,119 --> 00:57:32,119
bit of an a motivator to people like

1431
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:34,340
look you know things nobody could have

1432
00:57:32,119 --> 00:57:35,900
seen this coming but you know we need to

1433
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:37,970
take into account things happen

1434
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:40,970
sometimes it like I just cannot come out

1435
00:57:37,969 --> 00:57:42,799
there and see you and if I can't come

1436
00:57:40,969 --> 00:57:45,079
out and shake your plants out and

1437
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:47,030
identify your bugs you got to get good

1438
00:57:45,079 --> 00:57:49,460
pictures to me you got to get good at

1439
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:52,310
doing you know and and we're open to

1440
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:53,570
doing getting on skype and you know put

1441
00:57:52,309 --> 00:57:56,329
us on your phone and walk around your

1442
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:58,910
room with us and where we can see it but

1443
00:57:56,329 --> 00:58:01,039
this right now should be the biggest

1444
00:57:58,909 --> 00:58:03,079
reason for people to start communicating

1445
00:58:01,039 --> 00:58:05,630
being better I mean we're all doing zoom

1446
00:58:03,079 --> 00:58:07,279
meetings and stuff to to check in and

1447
00:58:05,630 --> 00:58:08,539
most people are working from home if

1448
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:12,470
they can

1449
00:58:08,539 --> 00:58:14,809
so it's time times like this gear up and

1450
00:58:12,469 --> 00:58:16,759
have good ways to send us good photos

1451
00:58:14,809 --> 00:58:20,059
because the truth is I've been looking

1452
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:22,010
at bugs for 20 years I still have I

1453
00:58:20,059 --> 00:58:24,049
still have to have an incredibly clear

1454
00:58:22,010 --> 00:58:27,110
picture for me to with certainty tell

1455
00:58:24,050 --> 00:58:29,120
you now I can with certainly to

1456
00:58:27,110 --> 00:58:32,510
certainty tell you if it's a strip or a

1457
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:33,018
spider fight or thrips Oh Suzanne's a

1458
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:35,028
rake

1459
00:58:33,018 --> 00:58:38,088
over the coals for that it's three no

1460
00:58:35,028 --> 00:58:41,059
never thrift it strips I can tell you if

1461
00:58:38,088 --> 00:58:42,409
it's the strips or a spider mite a lot

1462
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:45,769
of times I can tell you yeah it's

1463
00:58:42,409 --> 00:58:48,439
Western flour thrips but those are rare

1464
00:58:45,768 --> 00:58:51,408
when I get a photo of that good most

1465
00:58:48,438 --> 00:58:53,328
times it's a blurry photo of what ends

1466
00:58:51,409 --> 00:58:57,048
up being springtails or something like

1467
00:58:53,329 --> 00:58:59,179
that but yeah that's a good soap box to

1468
00:58:57,048 --> 00:59:01,909
get up on and I believe was it you or

1469
00:58:59,179 --> 00:59:05,689
Suzanne who did a talk specifically on

1470
00:59:01,909 --> 00:59:09,229
that at the biocontrol show about being

1471
00:59:05,688 --> 00:59:13,248
better at taking photos and now Suzanne

1472
00:59:09,228 --> 00:59:15,498
mine was on evaluating products for your

1473
00:59:13,248 --> 00:59:17,298
garden making good production decisions

1474
00:59:15,498 --> 00:59:20,358
in terms of what you need to do in terms

1475
00:59:17,298 --> 00:59:22,668
of research and in scientific method

1476
00:59:20,358 --> 00:59:25,458
when you're going to bring any product

1477
00:59:22,668 --> 00:59:28,489
into your garden that was my talk which

1478
00:59:25,458 --> 00:59:30,918
was fun but the other side I see on my

1479
00:59:28,489 --> 00:59:34,668
side of the industry with soil is I'll

1480
00:59:30,918 --> 00:59:36,648
get a photo of a leaf and they want me

1481
00:59:34,668 --> 00:59:38,778
they want me to tell them what's going

1482
00:59:36,648 --> 00:59:42,380
on you know whether it's a deficiency

1483
00:59:38,778 --> 00:59:45,619
whether it's a powder yeah and you you

1484
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:47,778
literally can't so like I come back and

1485
00:59:45,619 --> 00:59:50,298
I'll need to see a photo of the entire

1486
00:59:47,778 --> 00:59:52,639
plant for one so I can see if it's a

1487
00:59:50,298 --> 00:59:54,228
mobile nutrient if it is an efficiency I

1488
00:59:52,639 --> 00:59:55,969
need to know if it are pest pressure

1489
00:59:54,228 --> 00:59:58,098
what other things you might have foliar

1490
00:59:55,969 --> 00:59:59,418
sprayed what kind of lighting what your

1491
00:59:58,099 --> 01:00:02,119
environment looks like how are you

1492
00:59:59,418 --> 01:00:03,739
watering what's the hydrology process

1493
01:00:02,119 --> 01:00:06,169
with your soil like that's that's a huge

1494
01:00:03,739 --> 01:00:08,509
thing when it comes to deficiencies and

1495
01:00:06,168 --> 01:00:13,158
you know 9 the soil gets blamed for

1496
01:00:08,509 --> 01:00:14,809
everything in nutrient programs and to

1497
01:00:13,159 --> 01:00:16,099
be fair a lot of times it can be

1498
01:00:14,809 --> 01:00:17,899
something like that but with a lot of

1499
01:00:16,099 --> 01:00:19,939
these you know living soil programs I'm

1500
01:00:17,898 --> 01:00:21,978
finding a lot of times it's it's it

1501
01:00:19,938 --> 01:00:23,598
comes down to the watering or other

1502
01:00:21,978 --> 01:00:24,948
stuff that they're doing that they

1503
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:26,419
figure that they do and that's where

1504
01:00:24,949 --> 01:00:28,130
going to the facility like you said you

1505
01:00:26,418 --> 01:00:30,438
may look over in a corner and see a

1506
01:00:28,130 --> 01:00:31,909
bottle of something and be like oh are

1507
01:00:30,438 --> 01:00:34,009
you using that they're like oh yeah we

1508
01:00:31,909 --> 01:00:36,318
used it and we just forgot to put it on

1509
01:00:34,009 --> 01:00:38,119
the email and those are the kind of

1510
01:00:36,318 --> 01:00:40,909
things that you miss from these photos

1511
01:00:38,119 --> 01:00:42,619
that's so important and that's just

1512
01:00:40,909 --> 01:00:45,349
something that I that would probably be

1513
01:00:42,619 --> 01:00:46,380
my biggest soapbox moment water water

1514
01:00:45,349 --> 01:00:48,420
management

1515
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:53,039
it's I mean it really is the foundation

1516
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:55,470
of so many things like it really ripples

1517
01:00:53,039 --> 01:00:58,259
out to affecting how effective every

1518
01:00:55,469 --> 01:00:59,789
other thing you do is and you know for

1519
01:00:58,260 --> 01:01:01,200
an instance like it's funny because you

1520
01:00:59,789 --> 01:01:03,090
say the soil gets blamed for everything

1521
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:04,980
sometimes you just can't help the soil

1522
01:01:03,090 --> 01:01:07,050
you're growing in so you have to learn

1523
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:09,719
how to manage the soil that you have

1524
01:01:07,050 --> 01:01:12,390
I have growers that they got in over

1525
01:01:09,719 --> 01:01:16,199
their heads trying to do living soil in

1526
01:01:12,389 --> 01:01:18,059
very shallow raised beds and now they

1527
01:01:16,199 --> 01:01:21,359
have gone a little overboard and they've

1528
01:01:18,059 --> 01:01:22,799
got this incredibly organic soil that I

1529
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:26,130
mean it might as well be growing in

1530
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:28,380
compost so now there's a lot of stuff a

1531
01:01:26,130 --> 01:01:30,480
lot of a lot of bio activity in there

1532
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:33,420
they hadn't accounted for another thing

1533
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:35,309
that's going on the same one all of

1534
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:37,409
their old mulch and stuff that's in

1535
01:01:35,309 --> 01:01:41,460
there decaying is now just playing a

1536
01:01:37,409 --> 01:01:43,859
huge host to isopods suits Roly Polys

1537
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:45,900
toe bugs and they're actually starting

1538
01:01:43,860 --> 01:01:48,180
to damage their young plants there

1539
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:50,430
they're feeding on the skin like

1540
01:01:48,179 --> 01:01:54,509
basically girdling these small plants

1541
01:01:50,429 --> 01:01:56,279
now they really do need to just once

1542
01:01:54,510 --> 01:01:58,440
they harvest just change this out this

1543
01:01:56,280 --> 01:02:00,720
whole system out that's what I told them

1544
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:02,220
the last harvest and they still growing

1545
01:02:00,719 --> 01:02:04,259
in the same spot this year with some of

1546
01:02:02,219 --> 01:02:06,389
the same problems but another thing that

1547
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:08,100
has a lot to do with all of that stuff

1548
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:11,489
happening the way it is is the fact that

1549
01:02:08,099 --> 01:02:12,900
they overwater under watering is not or

1550
01:02:11,489 --> 01:02:15,059
you know backing off the water is not

1551
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:16,920
going to fix that problem but it's

1552
01:02:15,059 --> 01:02:17,610
certainly going it's not going to make

1553
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:19,769
it worse

1554
01:02:17,610 --> 01:02:21,180
just like a lot of times we have growers

1555
01:02:19,769 --> 01:02:23,730
to get concerned when they see huge

1556
01:02:21,179 --> 01:02:26,519
abundance and springtails for one

1557
01:02:23,730 --> 01:02:28,469
springtails aren't really a bad bug but

1558
01:02:26,519 --> 01:02:30,570
I like to say spring tales are good

1559
01:02:28,469 --> 01:02:33,419
Scouts because spring tales like dead

1560
01:02:30,570 --> 01:02:35,190
roots so if I walk past a plant that's

1561
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:36,900
just exploding with spring tails I know

1562
01:02:35,190 --> 01:02:38,849
that spring tales aren't the problem but

1563
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:40,920
I want to know why so many spring tales

1564
01:02:38,849 --> 01:02:42,239
have something to eat that tells me

1565
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:45,900
there's a lot of dead roots in this

1566
01:02:42,239 --> 01:02:48,779
plant so is it up is it a soil you know

1567
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:50,130
do I have a root disease do I have

1568
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:52,470
something going on there nine times out

1569
01:02:50,130 --> 01:02:55,250
of ten it's over watering because spring

1570
01:02:52,469 --> 01:02:58,439
tales for one are you familiar with them

1571
01:02:55,250 --> 01:03:00,000
yes I see them a lot in these girls you

1572
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:01,409
know spring tales

1573
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,940
you know a little bit about them they're

1574
01:03:01,409 --> 01:03:05,009
technically they're not even insects

1575
01:03:02,940 --> 01:03:08,579
they're a whole separate group of

1576
01:03:05,010 --> 01:03:11,760
arthropods called : Bella they're very

1577
01:03:08,579 --> 01:03:13,799
they share a common ancestor but they're

1578
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:15,720
technically not insects and and if you

1579
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:17,460
look at them you look at their Anatomy

1580
01:03:15,719 --> 01:03:21,500
you can see it - certain things don't

1581
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:24,840
don't match up you know totally wingless

1582
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:26,579
very very primitive compared to an

1583
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:28,500
insect when it comes down to their

1584
01:03:26,579 --> 01:03:32,639
actual physiology and and the main way

1585
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:34,349
is insects have very very primitive kind

1586
01:03:32,639 --> 01:03:35,789
of lungs that I like to compare it to

1587
01:03:34,349 --> 01:03:38,819
like the chambers inside of like a

1588
01:03:35,789 --> 01:03:42,090
harmonica or something isopods

1589
01:03:38,820 --> 01:03:46,080
or a colon Bela even less they have to

1590
01:03:42,090 --> 01:03:48,000
diffuse oxygen out of water so they have

1591
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:51,509
to have they have to be wet to breathe

1592
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:53,550
so what does that tell you if you if you

1593
01:03:51,510 --> 01:03:56,220
want to send their numbers out they

1594
01:03:53,550 --> 01:03:57,810
cannot live in dry soil but I have

1595
01:03:56,219 --> 01:03:59,909
growers that just keep battling

1596
01:03:57,809 --> 01:04:01,079
springtails not battling them but they

1597
01:03:59,909 --> 01:04:03,420
don't you know they're saying well why

1598
01:04:01,079 --> 01:04:06,569
do we have so many of them you don't

1599
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:08,400
have any diseases you're over watering

1600
01:04:06,570 --> 01:04:10,980
they can't breathe if you take that

1601
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:14,430
water out of there but they'll blame the

1602
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:17,250
soil the blames the roots or you know

1603
01:04:14,429 --> 01:04:19,559
what do I need to spray you know you

1604
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:22,619
need to spray less water that's what you

1605
01:04:19,559 --> 01:04:24,239
need to do well I always under the

1606
01:04:22,619 --> 01:04:27,059
impression that springtails not only a

1607
01:04:24,239 --> 01:04:29,579
dead roots but other forms of organic

1608
01:04:27,059 --> 01:04:31,590
matter as well so if you're using a soil

1609
01:04:29,579 --> 01:04:32,610
that has high levels of compost or

1610
01:04:31,590 --> 01:04:35,490
you're recycling

1611
01:04:32,610 --> 01:04:37,620
sort of your beds with these you know

1612
01:04:35,489 --> 01:04:38,939
flour rooms you're gonna have root hairs

1613
01:04:37,619 --> 01:04:41,849
that are just left over from the

1614
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:44,789
previous grow is that yeah a concern

1615
01:04:41,849 --> 01:04:46,710
because my thought on the other side of

1616
01:04:44,789 --> 01:04:48,690
this is well if we start having a wet

1617
01:04:46,710 --> 01:04:50,159
dry cycles or allow the soil to dry out

1618
01:04:48,690 --> 01:04:52,579
too much then we're reducing our

1619
01:04:50,159 --> 01:04:55,379
nutrient cycling on a microbial level

1620
01:04:52,579 --> 01:04:59,340
there's there's a balance there for sure

1621
01:04:55,380 --> 01:05:04,860
you can definitely overwater right where

1622
01:04:59,340 --> 01:05:06,840
does their own balance lie I guess yeah

1623
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:08,610
and you are right about them being kind

1624
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:10,079
of a little more of a generalist debt

1625
01:05:08,610 --> 01:05:13,410
reward that they're gonna feed on other

1626
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:14,259
stuff as well the concern with it that I

1627
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:16,089
have actually seen

1628
01:05:14,260 --> 01:05:19,450
this in person and it's kind of like the

1629
01:05:16,090 --> 01:05:21,579
the the pill bugs damaging these these

1630
01:05:19,449 --> 01:05:23,619
plants usually pill bugs they're not a

1631
01:05:21,579 --> 01:05:26,250
pest good luck trying to find any

1632
01:05:23,619 --> 01:05:28,779
information on controlling pill bugs

1633
01:05:26,250 --> 01:05:30,639
because all of everything you're gonna

1634
01:05:28,780 --> 01:05:33,160
find that reads gonna say they feed on

1635
01:05:30,639 --> 01:05:34,719
rotting things they don't feed on new

1636
01:05:33,159 --> 01:05:37,359
cannabis plants but here they are

1637
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:39,489
feeding on them and it's a lot of times

1638
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:42,190
when you get an abundance of something

1639
01:05:39,489 --> 01:05:43,959
and it doesn't have it has way too much

1640
01:05:42,190 --> 01:05:46,090
competition for its preferred food

1641
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:49,269
source they get creative they may not

1642
01:05:46,090 --> 01:05:52,600
you know infest a plant like they're

1643
01:05:49,269 --> 01:05:56,559
going to if they were a thirds or thrips

1644
01:05:52,599 --> 01:05:59,380
or anything like that but in my case it

1645
01:05:56,559 --> 01:06:01,989
was a crop of dianthus of carnations

1646
01:05:59,380 --> 01:06:04,119
that was just they're very tricky plant

1647
01:06:01,989 --> 01:06:06,639
to water and if you're not careful

1648
01:06:04,119 --> 01:06:07,719
you'll overwater them and people weren't

1649
01:06:06,639 --> 01:06:10,629
careful and they're pretty much

1650
01:06:07,719 --> 01:06:12,369
constantly over watered so that was my

1651
01:06:10,630 --> 01:06:14,470
little I called it the popcorn because

1652
01:06:12,369 --> 01:06:18,190
it's like just spring tail jumping out

1653
01:06:14,469 --> 01:06:20,199
of every pot and I would pull the roots

1654
01:06:18,190 --> 01:06:22,720
out to make sure you know that they're

1655
01:06:20,199 --> 01:06:24,969
they're not doing the damage that that I

1656
01:06:22,719 --> 01:06:26,889
assumed they could and then lo and

1657
01:06:24,969 --> 01:06:29,139
behold we start finding them feeding on

1658
01:06:26,889 --> 01:06:31,359
live roots and damaging our plants and

1659
01:06:29,139 --> 01:06:33,819
it was only because I had they're so

1660
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:34,360
untended that they're running out of

1661
01:06:33,820 --> 01:06:37,059
dead roots

1662
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:39,460
there's too many this it's like this

1663
01:06:37,059 --> 01:06:41,559
place is so abundantly good for them now

1664
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:43,740
there's too many of them and at that

1665
01:06:41,559 --> 01:06:46,480
point you have to back off of the water

1666
01:06:43,739 --> 01:06:50,139
you want springtails in your soil you

1667
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:51,670
know you want isopods in your soil you

1668
01:06:50,139 --> 01:06:52,900
don't want them to the point that

1669
01:06:51,670 --> 01:06:56,320
they're so hungry that they're gonna

1670
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:58,000
start costing you money that's a good

1671
01:06:56,320 --> 01:07:02,650
point that's a good point I have seen

1672
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:04,690
the roly-poly bugs girdling class like I

1673
01:07:02,650 --> 01:07:06,220
had never had never seen that until

1674
01:07:04,690 --> 01:07:08,050
working with this there's a lot of

1675
01:07:06,219 --> 01:07:10,449
things I had never seen until working in

1676
01:07:08,050 --> 01:07:12,250
cannabis and I'm not trying to poke fun

1677
01:07:10,449 --> 01:07:14,859
or anything but a lot of times growers

1678
01:07:12,250 --> 01:07:16,360
like the whole living soil and I have a

1679
01:07:14,860 --> 01:07:20,260
lot of growers that are big and you know

1680
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:22,809
Korean natural the KNF growing it's one

1681
01:07:20,260 --> 01:07:25,780
like you can really screw it up if you

1682
01:07:22,809 --> 01:07:27,820
don't follow the fundamentals of it and

1683
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:30,010
you can end up with a really funky

1684
01:07:27,820 --> 01:07:31,690
soyal going on that like you might have

1685
01:07:30,010 --> 01:07:36,610
just created a whole lot of problems for

1686
01:07:31,690 --> 01:07:40,929
yourself yeah no I I get that I there

1687
01:07:36,610 --> 01:07:44,440
are certain things about no-till growing

1688
01:07:40,929 --> 01:07:46,569
and you know some of these processes

1689
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:48,820
that I don't believe translate well to

1690
01:07:46,570 --> 01:07:50,230
controlled environment agriculture now

1691
01:07:48,820 --> 01:07:51,070
as you know I'm a big proponent of

1692
01:07:50,230 --> 01:07:53,679
living soils

1693
01:07:51,070 --> 01:07:57,340
I personally however don't believe in

1694
01:07:53,679 --> 01:07:59,289
using cover crops indoors and living

1695
01:07:57,340 --> 01:08:00,940
mulch or even mulch is in general

1696
01:07:59,289 --> 01:08:02,800
because of the some of the challenges

1697
01:08:00,940 --> 01:08:05,110
that you mentioned we just don't have

1698
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:07,780
the diversity about diversity that you

1699
01:08:05,110 --> 01:08:11,050
see outdoors it allows for these things

1700
01:08:07,780 --> 01:08:12,670
to be really effective but and some

1701
01:08:11,050 --> 01:08:13,990
people do it successfully so I don't

1702
01:08:12,670 --> 01:08:17,289
want to say oh there's only one way to

1703
01:08:13,989 --> 01:08:19,239
do it I don't own them but and and and I

1704
01:08:17,289 --> 01:08:21,100
have we have a grow that we work with up

1705
01:08:19,239 --> 01:08:23,949
in northern Washington like in the

1706
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:25,838
northern Okanagan Valley that right when

1707
01:08:23,949 --> 01:08:28,119
I was starting to kind of almost think

1708
01:08:25,838 --> 01:08:29,559
like god I hate these things no-till

1709
01:08:28,119 --> 01:08:32,289
growers because they're not doing it

1710
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:34,180
right I've went visited this farm and

1711
01:08:32,289 --> 01:08:36,609
it's to this day I use them as an

1712
01:08:34,180 --> 01:08:39,400
example it's like one of the healthiest

1713
01:08:36,609 --> 01:08:42,310
just like most kick-ass farms I've ever

1714
01:08:39,399 --> 01:08:44,799
been to because these guys are committed

1715
01:08:42,310 --> 01:08:46,839
it's and biocontrol is very similar like

1716
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:49,060
when you commit to it you see what it

1717
01:08:46,838 --> 01:08:50,619
can do it's great but if you go in half

1718
01:08:49,060 --> 01:08:52,930
hearted and you're not going to stick to

1719
01:08:50,619 --> 01:08:57,369
it it's the same thing with something as

1720
01:08:52,930 --> 01:08:59,350
involved and time and with as much time

1721
01:08:57,369 --> 01:09:01,920
involved as building a good no-till

1722
01:08:59,350 --> 01:09:04,750
environment for soil and I would assume

1723
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:08,380
much like ours you have a better chance

1724
01:09:04,750 --> 01:09:10,390
of succeeding when you have access to

1725
01:09:08,380 --> 01:09:12,760
people who know about it and can support

1726
01:09:10,390 --> 01:09:17,220
you with it soil much the same approach

1727
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:22,119
I would assume yeah yeah I mean for me I

1728
01:09:17,220 --> 01:09:23,500
find that running a cover crop just it

1729
01:09:22,119 --> 01:09:25,989
creates another crop that you have to

1730
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:29,020
manage which is challenging indoors it's

1731
01:09:25,989 --> 01:09:32,619
potentially going to be another vector

1732
01:09:29,020 --> 01:09:36,850
for anything from pathogens to insects

1733
01:09:32,619 --> 01:09:38,500
and pests and then these mulch is I

1734
01:09:36,850 --> 01:09:39,780
think you can get carried away with

1735
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:40,949
organic matter it's

1736
01:09:39,779 --> 01:09:43,319
already gonna be really high if you're

1737
01:09:40,949 --> 01:09:45,420
running a living soil so those are my

1738
01:09:43,319 --> 01:09:47,549
concerns I mean they they all are very

1739
01:09:45,420 --> 01:09:49,170
cool sustainable concepts that I a

1740
01:09:47,550 --> 01:09:51,810
hundred percent believe in when it comes

1741
01:09:49,170 --> 01:09:54,210
to agriculture or outdoors but indoor

1742
01:09:51,810 --> 01:09:57,000
air I just you don't get that same level

1743
01:09:54,210 --> 01:09:59,010
diversity and then in terms of no-till I

1744
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:01,079
get this question a lot so I have a blog

1745
01:09:59,010 --> 01:10:03,900
post on it with my thoughts again this

1746
01:10:01,079 --> 01:10:07,829
is all of my just my opinion but for me

1747
01:10:03,899 --> 01:10:11,069
I like to mix nutrients into the soil

1748
01:10:07,829 --> 01:10:13,800
and disturb the soil when I read a

1749
01:10:11,069 --> 01:10:16,409
living soil bed because we are cropping

1750
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:18,199
so rapidly that I want to get those

1751
01:10:16,409 --> 01:10:21,059
nutrients down into the rhizosphere

1752
01:10:18,199 --> 01:10:22,590
quickly I don't if we're using organic

1753
01:10:21,060 --> 01:10:24,630
amendments and we're not using mineral

1754
01:10:22,590 --> 01:10:26,659
salts I don't have the luxury of that

1755
01:10:24,630 --> 01:10:28,829
time for that to break down like I would

1756
01:10:26,659 --> 01:10:30,510
outdoors cuz outdoors you know if you're

1757
01:10:28,829 --> 01:10:33,029
growing an agricultural land sure you

1758
01:10:30,510 --> 01:10:36,119
don't have to tell you can top dress you

1759
01:10:33,029 --> 01:10:38,849
can allow you can run you know other

1760
01:10:36,119 --> 01:10:40,529
crops during off crop cycles you can

1761
01:10:38,850 --> 01:10:41,670
allow that soil to rest there's all

1762
01:10:40,529 --> 01:10:43,859
these other things but if you're trying

1763
01:10:41,670 --> 01:10:46,980
to bring in your next crop 24 to 36

1764
01:10:43,859 --> 01:10:49,170
hours later in the flowering room I like

1765
01:10:46,979 --> 01:10:51,449
to get those nutrients mixed into the

1766
01:10:49,170 --> 01:10:52,739
soil and I get these questions a lot so

1767
01:10:51,449 --> 01:10:55,529
I just want to mention them on the end

1768
01:10:52,739 --> 01:10:57,449
of this podcast just because well yeah I

1769
01:10:55,529 --> 01:11:00,420
mean you got to take into account you're

1770
01:10:57,449 --> 01:11:03,000
growing a crop that you're growing a

1771
01:11:00,420 --> 01:11:06,180
crop that right out of the gate is just

1772
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:08,069
a very hungry crop that is that you're

1773
01:11:06,180 --> 01:11:10,650
deliberately trying to give it as much

1774
01:11:08,069 --> 01:11:13,319
as possible to produce as healthy of a

1775
01:11:10,649 --> 01:11:15,029
plant so as you said outdoors you have

1776
01:11:13,319 --> 01:11:16,920
all of these all of these processes

1777
01:11:15,029 --> 01:11:20,519
working that you don't have working

1778
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:24,060
indoors that yeah and with production I

1779
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:27,120
mean we can do it as natural and as as

1780
01:11:24,060 --> 01:11:29,390
by you know by mother nature's guide as

1781
01:11:27,119 --> 01:11:32,599
possible but I've said this many times

1782
01:11:29,390 --> 01:11:36,000
there is no such thing as natural

1783
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:39,360
farming we have to accept that when we

1784
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:41,310
decide to put in a big mass quantity of

1785
01:11:39,359 --> 01:11:43,380
a crop that didn't just spring up out of

1786
01:11:41,310 --> 01:11:45,390
the earth on its own we have to do some

1787
01:11:43,380 --> 01:11:48,989
things differently we can keep it as

1788
01:11:45,390 --> 01:11:51,840
close to you know what Mother Nature's

1789
01:11:48,989 --> 01:11:53,760
providing us but Mother Nature this spot

1790
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:55,650
didn't evolve over the last million you

1791
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:58,199
years thinking that I was going to plant

1792
01:11:55,649 --> 01:12:02,219
a cannabis crop here or even even a

1793
01:11:58,198 --> 01:12:04,408
field of corn so we can do what was

1794
01:12:02,219 --> 01:12:06,239
naturally in place here we can amend the

1795
01:12:04,408 --> 01:12:08,098
soil naturally but we do have to take

1796
01:12:06,238 --> 01:12:09,689
some steps we have to ramp up some

1797
01:12:08,099 --> 01:12:12,900
numbers whether it's Predators or

1798
01:12:09,689 --> 01:12:15,029
whether it's nutrition in the soil you

1799
01:12:12,899 --> 01:12:21,058
know especially when we're growing at

1800
01:12:15,029 --> 01:12:23,969
such an a borderline unrealistic level

1801
01:12:21,059 --> 01:12:25,769
of quality you know that's it's grow

1802
01:12:23,969 --> 01:12:27,929
it's like it's like everybody's trying

1803
01:12:25,769 --> 01:12:31,469
to grow orchids you're growing perfect

1804
01:12:27,929 --> 01:12:33,840
plants so you have to have the nutrition

1805
01:12:31,469 --> 01:12:36,920
in the soil and something that I will

1806
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:39,210
never shake from working in such large

1807
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:41,819
environments and with such large crops

1808
01:12:39,210 --> 01:12:43,349
and working selling to box stores is

1809
01:12:41,819 --> 01:12:47,130
there was an incident emphasis on

1810
01:12:43,349 --> 01:12:47,849
uniformity hanging baskets had to be

1811
01:12:47,130 --> 01:12:51,000
identical

1812
01:12:47,849 --> 01:12:52,739
you know sometimes plants there were no

1813
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:56,368
visual flaws it just wasn't the right

1814
01:12:52,738 --> 01:12:59,428
shape so it has to go so you get you

1815
01:12:56,368 --> 01:13:01,078
very early learn the importance of the

1816
01:12:59,429 --> 01:13:02,849
assurance of knowing like what you're

1817
01:13:01,078 --> 01:13:04,198
saying putting those nutrients back in

1818
01:13:02,849 --> 01:13:06,690
the soil knowing that that stuff's going

1819
01:13:04,198 --> 01:13:08,038
to be there because you know in an

1820
01:13:06,689 --> 01:13:09,689
ornamental world you have to produce

1821
01:13:08,038 --> 01:13:11,939
little cookie cutter plants that look

1822
01:13:09,689 --> 01:13:14,308
exactly the same there's no way to do

1823
01:13:11,939 --> 01:13:17,538
that without knowing ok I'm putting

1824
01:13:14,309 --> 01:13:19,980
enough in for this crop at each turn

1825
01:13:17,538 --> 01:13:21,899
yeah plus the the breakdown of these

1826
01:13:19,979 --> 01:13:23,549
cover crops like let's say we have some

1827
01:13:21,899 --> 01:13:25,138
nitrogen fixers in there it's really

1828
01:13:23,550 --> 01:13:28,019
hard to control the amount of nitrogen

1829
01:13:25,139 --> 01:13:30,779
we're getting from the you know renzo

1830
01:13:28,019 --> 01:13:33,750
via and the clover that may be it may be

1831
01:13:30,779 --> 01:13:35,279
living right so managing nitrogen levels

1832
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:37,649
becomes more challenging especially as

1833
01:13:35,279 --> 01:13:39,599
we want a plant to senesce towards the

1834
01:13:37,649 --> 01:13:41,908
end of its life cycle as we go to

1835
01:13:39,599 --> 01:13:43,400
harvest it for flower so it's just it's

1836
01:13:41,908 --> 01:13:46,170
it's additional variability that

1837
01:13:43,399 --> 01:13:48,839
personally I don't like to do even

1838
01:13:46,170 --> 01:13:51,480
though it sounds really good and cool

1839
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:53,279
and it fits with my ethics I think it

1840
01:13:51,479 --> 01:13:56,189
creates challenges on a commercial scale

1841
01:13:53,279 --> 01:13:58,408
but if you have a four by four ten by

1842
01:13:56,189 --> 01:14:01,348
all means like it's great in those

1843
01:13:58,408 --> 01:14:03,448
situations it's it's all about scale man

1844
01:14:01,349 --> 01:14:06,050
and we try our hardest to not become

1845
01:14:03,448 --> 01:14:08,419
factory farms but it

1846
01:14:06,050 --> 01:14:11,960
certain point you production dictates

1847
01:14:08,420 --> 01:14:13,399
the way some things have to go and you

1848
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:15,469
know it's like I say there's always a

1849
01:14:13,399 --> 01:14:17,089
place for craft growing there's always a

1850
01:14:15,469 --> 01:14:19,460
place it's the reason there's still

1851
01:14:17,090 --> 01:14:22,480
craft brewery and there's there's craft

1852
01:14:19,460 --> 01:14:25,340
brews and there's Budweiser you know

1853
01:14:22,479 --> 01:14:29,000
there is a place for those true

1854
01:14:25,340 --> 01:14:31,069
approaches like that but when you know I

1855
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:33,380
come from the background of for many

1856
01:14:31,069 --> 01:14:35,269
years punching a clock and then getting

1857
01:14:33,380 --> 01:14:37,130
in a golf cart to drive around my

1858
01:14:35,270 --> 01:14:39,020
greenhouses because there was no way I

1859
01:14:37,130 --> 01:14:41,900
could walk them all and realistically

1860
01:14:39,020 --> 01:14:45,199
scout them in a day so when you scale

1861
01:14:41,899 --> 01:14:48,049
out to a certain point yeah you do have

1862
01:14:45,198 --> 01:14:49,549
to but still I mean as long as you're

1863
01:14:48,050 --> 01:14:52,610
coming into it with that approach of

1864
01:14:49,550 --> 01:14:54,529
doing as much as you can and only only

1865
01:14:52,609 --> 01:14:56,929
adding what you have to and then when

1866
01:14:54,529 --> 01:14:58,609
you do add it's like with biocontrol

1867
01:14:56,929 --> 01:15:00,408
we're just putting in stuff that's

1868
01:14:58,609 --> 01:15:03,828
that's naturally occurring when you're

1869
01:15:00,408 --> 01:15:06,679
amending soil you're you're amending it

1870
01:15:03,828 --> 01:15:08,658
with organic stuff so the people that

1871
01:15:06,679 --> 01:15:12,920
get stuck in no-till and they refuse to

1872
01:15:08,658 --> 01:15:14,988
do make changes and we have a grower

1873
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:16,639
who's dealing with some pylons every

1874
01:15:14,988 --> 01:15:19,189
year that's one that you don't ever

1875
01:15:16,639 --> 01:15:20,809
barely ever hear about some pylons they

1876
01:15:19,189 --> 01:15:24,198
look like little teeny tiny centipedes

1877
01:15:20,809 --> 01:15:27,260
that live down in the soil and they're

1878
01:15:24,198 --> 01:15:29,299
an annual pest every year in the exact

1879
01:15:27,260 --> 01:15:34,190
same spot on their farm they get a huge

1880
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:36,230
issue with the roots being damaged you

1881
01:15:34,189 --> 01:15:38,988
know you have to do something about

1882
01:15:36,229 --> 01:15:41,328
problems like that with some pylons a

1883
01:15:38,988 --> 01:15:43,819
lot of times people plant potatoes as a

1884
01:15:41,328 --> 01:15:45,859
as a crop to kind of get them out of the

1885
01:15:43,819 --> 01:15:48,229
soil and that's what they're going to

1886
01:15:45,859 --> 01:15:51,170
start doing next season this the season

1887
01:15:48,229 --> 01:15:52,488
they didn't get to it in time and by the

1888
01:15:51,170 --> 01:15:53,899
end of the season I'll have some good

1889
01:15:52,488 --> 01:15:56,598
pictures for you of what they do to

1890
01:15:53,899 --> 01:15:58,519
plants hmm that's cool

1891
01:15:56,599 --> 01:16:02,328
well I feel like you and I could talk

1892
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:03,829
all day I know your man yeah I got to

1893
01:16:02,328 --> 01:16:07,578
get back now and out with my newborn

1894
01:16:03,828 --> 01:16:09,229
clod I catch up soon as much time and

1895
01:16:07,578 --> 01:16:10,729
yeah I could talk about this stuff all

1896
01:16:09,229 --> 01:16:13,789
day and any time you want to talk about

1897
01:16:10,729 --> 01:16:15,769
the phorid on the cannabis aphid that is

1898
01:16:13,789 --> 01:16:18,189
one I could probably focus on and just

1899
01:16:15,770 --> 01:16:20,740
stay on topic for an entire so

1900
01:16:18,189 --> 01:16:22,329
alright I'll do a follow up with you

1901
01:16:20,739 --> 01:16:24,099
here on the canvas aphid but thank you

1902
01:16:22,329 --> 01:16:25,930
so much for your time today and you and

1903
01:16:24,100 --> 01:16:27,610
you and your family stay safe this is

1904
01:16:25,930 --> 01:16:29,850
gonna be a very dated podcast because

1905
01:16:27,609 --> 01:16:34,000
we're talking about this virus hopefully

1906
01:16:29,850 --> 01:16:35,440
every six months a year from now it

1907
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:37,689
won't be nearly the impact that we're

1908
01:16:35,439 --> 01:16:39,250
all seeing so of course well man thank

1909
01:16:37,689 --> 01:16:41,279
you so much for having me and I'm sorry

1910
01:16:39,250 --> 01:16:43,779
it took so long to make it happen and

1911
01:16:41,279 --> 01:16:45,699
but yeah so let's stay in touch I look

1912
01:16:43,779 --> 01:16:57,250
forward to hearing it alright have a

1913
01:16:45,699 --> 01:16:59,409
great day thank that that was Kelly

were listening to the cannabis

1916
01:17:00,399 --> 01:17:04,750
cultivation and science podcast I'm your
