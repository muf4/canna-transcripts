1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,040
so I get asked from time to time what

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:10,199
lights am I using in my grow and what

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,359
light companies do I recommend so I've

4
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:13,558
worked with a few different light

5
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:15,518
companies over the years and the one

6
00:00:13,558 --> 00:00:18,960
that I'm using in my grow right now is

7
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:22,518
bios I love their lights they're a

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,800
smaller company uh NASA spin-off so the

9
00:00:22,518 --> 00:00:26,598
lights are well engineered I love that

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,759
NASA connection I just think as a nerd

11
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:31,518
that's so cool um some of the highlights

12
00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:34,439
about these lights so not only do they

13
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:39,000
have very very good uh power levels

14
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:41,199
efficacy all of that they have this uh

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,719
glass cover on the lights I think that's

16
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,680
really really important because if I I

17
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:47,359
just cleaned my lights today for example

18
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:48,759
and you know the amount of dust and

19
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:51,479
overspraying stuff that can end up on

20
00:00:48,759 --> 00:00:54,399
your lights can really affect the

21
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:56,238
overall uh par ppfd levels that you're

22
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,719
getting down here and you may not even

23
00:00:56,238 --> 00:01:01,238
realize it and you don't want to be

24
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:03,640
cleaning exposed diode so that to me is

25
00:01:01,238 --> 00:01:05,560
number one when I'm looking at an LED

26
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:08,799
light uh

27
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:11,560
secondly customer service and uh

28
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,520
warranties are huge because the light is

29
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,400
so wellb built they have a seven-year

30
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:17,640
warranty I don't know if anyone else in

31
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:20,079
the industry even coming close to that

32
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,920
and uh I work really closely with my rep

33
00:01:20,078 --> 00:01:25,039
uh Jennifer she's wonderful and so uh

34
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,200
she helps me with lighting proposals

35
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,439
technical questions and I can you know

36
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,240
we have a great relationship I can just

37
00:01:28,438 --> 00:01:33,959
shoot her a text so I love having that

38
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:35,359
one toone close relationship and I

39
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:37,039
haven't had any issues with the light

40
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:40,519
but I know if I do they're going to take

41
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,880
good care of me uh this light here to

42
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:45,280
tell you the difference this is the ti2

43
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:47,679
so this light's been out um I mean don't

44
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,680
quote me on this but for a few years now

45
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,280
um my only complaint with this light is

46
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,159
it's a little overbuilt it's just it's

47
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,599
really heavy to lift up and down um that

48
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,960
makes it a little bit unwieldy but

49
00:01:55,599 --> 00:02:00,000
that's cuz it's built like a tank like I

50
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:02,158
feel like I could drop this light and it

51
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,478
would still work just

52
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:08,640
fine but moving over here they just came

53
00:02:05,478 --> 00:02:10,199
out with this light last year um I was

54
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,479
fortunate enough to get one of their

55
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:16,159
prototypes um but this is the this is

56
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:19,000
the BIOS Endeavor I love this light it's

57
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:21,239
a six light bar instead of the ti2 which

58
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,439
is an eight light bar over there you can

59
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:25,560
see the difference but the power levels

60
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:28,560
are really really close I'm running both

61
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,519
of these I think they're 650 watt if for

62
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,439
some reason you needed like an 800 watt

63
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:35,239
light then you'd have to move over to

64
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:38,239
the ti2 cuz this one's only 650 but it

65
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:41,560
weighs 11 lb it's so easy to move up and

66
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:44,280
down it folds out um so installation

67
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:47,000
took me all of 2 minutes it's pretty

68
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:49,400
much plug andplay and I just I love the

69
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,878
form factor um the plants as you can see

70
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:54,519
are doing just as well under it as they

71
00:02:51,878 --> 00:02:57,158
are under the

72
00:02:54,519 --> 00:03:00,080
ti2 so I just wanted to mention that we

73
00:02:57,158 --> 00:03:02,399
work with bios directly so if you wanted

74
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,760
a lighting proposal or an estimate on

75
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,799
one of these lights if you wanted to try

76
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:10,120
out the Endeavor or the ti2 in your

77
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:11,920
garden or you're interested in the Luna

78
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:14,360
or some of their you know top bar

79
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:16,000
Greenhouse lights uh just hit us up I'm

80
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,480
happy to get you over the spec sheets

81
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,560
any information you may want on them and

82
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:22,919
even help with a lighting proposal or

83
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:26,400
design for your space specifically all

84
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:26,399
right thanks for checking it out
