1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:05,480
so someone commented on one of my recent

2
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:07,759
YouTube videos with a great question

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:10,400
they asked one what are you doing in a

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:13,359
garage and two why didn't you prune the

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,519
plants better and so it got me thinking

6
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:17,000
and I wanted to give a thoughtful reply

7
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,679
uh so the reason I'm in a garage is

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,960
because this is a tester room that I set

9
00:00:18,679 --> 00:00:23,839
up to try out new products um different

10
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,800
ways of growing and also have a place

11
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:28,480
just to shoot videos so I want to be

12
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,160
able to demonstrate how simple and easy

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,399
it is to grow plants and an afford

14
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,799
manner without a whole bunch of products

15
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,600
uh secondly it got me thinking about why

16
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:39,558
I prune cuz subconsciously I wasn't

17
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:42,000
really concerned with how much pruning I

18
00:00:39,558 --> 00:00:45,039
had done in my room and I wanted to talk

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,119
to you kind of about why that is so why

20
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,840
do we prune well one of the main reason

21
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:52,000
we prune is for Pest and pathogen

22
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,640
pressure by reducing the amount of leaf

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,960
mass that we have here we're we're

24
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,640
effectively reducing habitat for Pest

25
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:00,799
and pathogens we're also increasing air

26
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,920
flow by doing this and by increasing air

27
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:05,079
flow there's no pockets for you know

28
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:07,159
different microclimates for powdery

29
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:09,840
mildew or other pathogens to start

30
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:12,000
growing and things like that um another

31
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,880
reason that we prune is for herbivory

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,159
this idea that insects are chewing on

33
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:19,239
the plants and so when we create a wound

34
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,400
here by cutting off this fan Leaf um

35
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:22,879
essentially what we're doing is we're

36
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,118
triggering SAR which is systemic

37
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:26,959
acquired resistance the immune system of

38
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:30,359
the plant uh and that has a ton of

39
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:32,399
benefits too so these are all various

40
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:34,438
reasons why we prune one other last

41
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:37,719
reason I want to mention is that some

42
00:01:34,438 --> 00:01:39,839
leaves lower down on the canopy are not

43
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:41,319
photosynthesizing as effectively as

44
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,040
leaves up here towards the top of the

45
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:46,158
canaby so things that are shaded out

46
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:49,320
down here potentially are nutrient sinks

47
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:51,280
so by removing those they're no longer

48
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:53,478
required by the plant to put energy into

49
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,799
maintaining that leaf though as we

50
00:01:53,478 --> 00:01:57,118
remove leaves we have to keep in mind

51
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,960
that some mobile nutrients are able to

52
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:02,078
be pulled from lower families if the

53
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:05,519
plant found a deficiency or needed them

54
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:07,158
so my thought on it is I have sufficient

55
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:09,199
airf flow you can see down below here I

56
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:11,480
turned it off but I have some under

57
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:14,199
canopy air flow going you know I have

58
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:16,679
other fans throughout the room so I have

59
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:19,719
really good air flow um and then it

60
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,400
comes down to to me time and labor and

61
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:23,840
this is more of an issue in a commercial

62
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,480
facility but I've been really busy

63
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,080
lately with work and family stuff so I

64
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:29,399
haven't had the time that I've wanted to

65
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,519
come in here and necessarily remove all

66
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,000
the lead

67
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:34,640
that um may not be required but I

68
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,080
haven't felt any pressure to that either

69
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:37,878
because like I said for the reasons

70
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,120
below I feel pretty confident in where

71
00:02:37,878 --> 00:02:41,919
I'm at right now and where my canopy is

72
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,719
to where I'm not really worried about so

73
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:47,679
much the pest and pathogen issue and I'd

74
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:49,280
rather not um spend that time pruning so

75
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,680
that's kind of a little bit behind it

76
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,560
and for a commercial facility you have

77
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,360
to realize like there's a tradeoff there

78
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:58,120
like how much do I need to prune to

79
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,319
reduce P Pest and pathogen pressure

80
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,719
without causing so much labor

81
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:05,079
that I'm raising my labor cost so high

82
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:06,719
without really improving my yield so

83
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,159
there is always a tradeoff there and

84
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:09,479
pruning can almost be more of an art

85
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:10,878
than a skill and there's certain things

86
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:14,119
that we want to consider when we're

87
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:15,719
pruning um but overall that that's sort

88
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,480
of what's going through my head when I

89
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:21,479
think about like when to prune why to

90
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:22,919
prune and and how to prune oh and one

91
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:26,238
last thing to mention it's another thing

92
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:28,119
is to open up the plant and allow for uh

93
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,280
light to hit various Bud sites if

94
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,400
there's tooo many large fan leaves

95
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,759
blocking those those buds just don't

96
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,200
seem to develop quite as well so hope

97
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:38,199
this is helpful thanks for checking it

98
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:38,199
out
