4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,519
science podcast I'm your host Tad Hussey

6
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,059
the podcast where we discuss The Cutting

7
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,219
Edge of growing from a science-based

8
00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:30,599
perspective and drawn top experts from

9
00:00:29,219 --> 00:00:31,979
around the industry to share their

10
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:33,899
wisdom and knowledge

11
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,219
first off I want to say thank you to

12
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:37,259
everyone who has tuned into the podcast

13
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:39,179
I know some of you have been listening

14
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:41,339
since the very beginning and others are

15
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:43,019
still just finding the podcast I really

16
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,879
appreciate when folks Reach Out directly

17
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,920
or leave a rating in review I do read

18
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:49,500

19
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,879
on social media it all really helps and

20
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,799
a big thank you to those of you who have

21
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:54,599
been able to support us on patreon as we

22
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:56,459
fired that back up and got new and

23
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,600
exclusive content for subscribers on

24
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,520
here

25
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,260
today's podcast is a little different

26
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,539
I've been listening to the Andrew

27
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:05,338
huberman podcast lately he's a

28
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:07,379
neuroscientist and professor at Stanford

29
00:01:05,338 --> 00:01:09,000
University and he does a variety of

30
00:01:07,379 --> 00:01:10,379
podcasts related to human health that

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,239
are worth checking out

32
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:14,459
anyway in addition to his regular

33
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:16,140
podcast interviews he does this extra

34
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:18,000
Series where he answers listener

35
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,739
questions and talks more in depth about

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,659
a variety of topics

37
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:23,640
the first 15 to 20 minutes of these

38
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:25,799
podcasts which he calls ask me anything

39
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,900
are available for free on the podcast

40
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:29,280
Channel and then you can subscribe to

41
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,299
his premium channel if you want to hear

42
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,519
the rest

43
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:34,618
well I have found in the course of all

44
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:36,239
my interviews I sometimes find topics

45
00:01:34,618 --> 00:01:38,879
that I want to talk about more in depth

46
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:40,798
or share a deeper opinion on than I get

47
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:42,298
to in the podcast itself

48
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,759
sometimes the flow of the podcast

49
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:46,618
changes direction or it just doesn't fit

50
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:48,359
in the context of the interview but

51
00:01:46,618 --> 00:01:49,799
regardless of the reason I thought a

52
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:52,078
format like this would allow me to both

53
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:53,579
share more information on the podcast as

54
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:55,078
well as further support and provide

55
00:01:53,578 --> 00:01:57,298
value to the listeners Who currently

56
00:01:55,078 --> 00:01:59,158
support our patreon Channel

57
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:01,259
also I found that in some of my earlier

58
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:02,640
interviews the information has changed

59
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:04,799
or I may not agree with everything that

60
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,540
was shared by a guest this will allow me

61
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,939
to go share an alternative Viewpoint or

62
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,439
perspective on a topic it takes me a

63
00:02:08,939 --> 00:02:12,180
long time now to vet guests for the show

64
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:14,219
and while I'd like to release podcasts

65
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:17,700
more frequently I'd rather focus on

66
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:19,979
quality content rather than quantity

67
00:02:17,699 --> 00:02:21,719
so in the spirit of this new idea I'll

68
00:02:19,979 --> 00:02:23,939
be releasing some shorter podcasts on

69
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:25,560
here that will be just me talking about

70
00:02:23,939 --> 00:02:27,479
a particular topic or answering

71
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,098
listeners submitted questions that I

72
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:31,139
think are really interesting or deserve

73
00:02:29,098 --> 00:02:32,340
to be shared some of the topics I know

74
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:35,219
I'd like to cover already are

75
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:37,020
mycorrhizal fungi the use of teas and

76
00:02:35,219 --> 00:02:39,539
cultivation like nutrient teas or

77
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:43,040
compost teas how water impacts

78
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:44,818
cultivation no-till in soilless media

79
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:46,859
science-based metrics for growing

80
00:02:44,818 --> 00:02:48,479
cannabis and much more

81
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,640
this is all going to be additional

82
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:52,919
content and won't take away from we are

83
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:54,419
already doing with the podcast I promise

84
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:56,098
that all the guest interviews I do

85
00:02:54,419 --> 00:02:57,899
outside of Kiss Organics will continue

86
00:02:56,098 --> 00:03:00,419
to be free to access on the podcast

87
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,739
that's really important to us and a part

88
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:04,199
of our mission to share and provide

89
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:05,878
science-based education

90
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:07,799
and I'd also like to give you an update

91
00:03:05,878 --> 00:03:08,939
with what's going on with kiss Organics

92
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,860
and my life

93
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:12,840
I'm finally ready to start growing at my

94
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:16,680
house I'm putting the finishing touches

95
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:19,019
on the HVAC which Dr Nadia Saba AKA Dr

96
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,760
Greenhouse gave me feedback on I

97
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:22,620
recorded that conversation and we did a

98
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:24,120
video walkthrough and I'll be sharing

99
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,080
that here soon too on our YouTube

100
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,759
channel

101
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,680
I have the electrical done finally

102
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:31,378
that's a whole other story on why it

103
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,120
took so long and we'll be hand watering

104
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:35,158
most of this first cycle but the goal is

105
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,719
to show the entire process of cannabis

106
00:03:35,158 --> 00:03:38,459
cultivation from a science-based

107
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:40,680
perspective and really share and talk

108
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:42,239
about what we're doing and why there's

109
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,920
too many companies out there right now

110
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,080
that will show you how to grow using

111
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:47,699
only their products and frankly I think

112
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,980
many of the products are not necessary

113
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:51,719
and a total waste of money I want to

114
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:53,219
show you how to grow amazing plants with

115
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:55,560
minimal inputs and look forward to

116
00:03:53,219 --> 00:03:57,598
starting that really soon

117
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:59,759
anyway today's topic for our first

118
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:01,798
podcast is the soil food web

119
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:05,158
this is a bit of a controversial topic

120
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:07,379
why I don't really know I think some

121
00:04:05,158 --> 00:04:09,479
quote unquote experts have taken this

122
00:04:07,378 --> 00:04:12,120
concept of microbial nutrient cycling or

123
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:13,438
the microbial Loop just way too far I

124
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,878
see this with a lot of methods or

125
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:17,579
beliefs in the organic gardening World

126
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:20,339
whether it's biodynamics Korean natural

127
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:23,100
farming soul food web mineral balancing

128
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:25,799
permaculture or some popular living soil

129
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:27,780
companies methods or ways folks get so

130
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,579
dogmatic about it it becomes part of

131
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:31,319
their identity and it starts to feel

132
00:04:29,579 --> 00:04:32,459
more like a religion than a cultivation

133
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:34,199
method

134
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:36,599
but today on what I want to focus on is

135
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:37,978
the soul food web how does it work how

136
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,360
do we use our knowledge of the soil food

137
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:42,120
web to improve our gardening or

138
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,520
cultivation practices what can microbes

139
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,079
really do or not do in our soil for

140
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:47,879
instance can they prevent or eliminate

141
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:50,219
disease or help plants resist pest

142
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:52,560
pressure does the fungal to bacteria

143
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:54,000
ratio really matter or play a role in

144
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,560
soil health

145
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,120
you've probably heard the statistics

146
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,759
before and they're pretty unbelievable

147
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,459
that a mere teaspoon of soil contains

148
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:05,220
over a billion bacteria several yards of

149
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:07,680
fungal hyphae thousands of protozoa and

150
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:10,199
40 to 50 nematodes or more

151
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,360
so what is the soil food web

152
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:14,819
the soul food web represents the

153
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:17,100
community of organisms many of which are

154
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:18,779
microscopic that live in the soil and

155
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,820
are a part of the ecosystem

156
00:05:18,779 --> 00:05:23,279
now why is it not the soil food chain

157
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:25,199
the idea being that one organism gets

158
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:26,939
eaten by another organism and this

159
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,740
continues in One Direction going from

160
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:30,719
one trophic level to another and on off

161
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:32,460
the chain well the reason it's called a

162
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,720
web is because of the complexity of

163
00:05:32,459 --> 00:05:35,939
these processes

164
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:38,340
in addition because much of the soil

165
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:39,899
food web is microscopic it's been very

166
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:42,060
difficult to research and fully

167
00:05:39,899 --> 00:05:44,339
understand in fact we are constantly

168
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:47,220
learning new things about how plants and

169
00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:49,739
microorganisms interact in the soil

170
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:52,259
for example Jeff lowenfell's new book

171
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:53,699
teeming with bacteria I had him on here

172
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:56,100
as a guest if you want to learn more on

173
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:58,978
this topic discusses new research from

174
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:00,960
Dr James White on rhizophagy particular

175
00:05:58,978 --> 00:06:03,360
bacteria called endophytes that are able

176
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:05,638
to move into the plant roots shed their

177
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,100
cellular walls release nutrients to the

178
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:10,560
plant and then move back out of the root

179
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:12,479
hair tips into the soil reform their

180
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,100
cellular walls where they can obtain

181
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:16,139
nutrients from the soil and then

182
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,879
potentially repeat the process

183
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:20,160
this is something we had no knowledge of

184
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:22,199
until 2008 when some researchers at the

185
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,520
University of Queensland discovered a

186
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:27,120
relationship between a particular

187
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:30,060
bacteria a non-pathogenic E coli and a

188
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:33,000
fungi saccharomyces cerevisiae also

189
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:34,978
known by most people is brewer's yeast

190
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,860
the soul food web is a dynamic

191
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:40,079
constantly changing ecosystem but the

192
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:42,000
concept is relatively simple

193
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:44,219
plants take in sunlight in the form of

194
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,079
photosynthesis and convert this to a

195
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:48,419
variety of different substances which

196
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:50,758
are then excreted as root exudates

197
00:06:48,418 --> 00:06:53,698
these exudates are comprised of sugars

198
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:56,879
amino acids organic acids vitamins

199
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:59,400
enzymes and more these x8s not only feed

200
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:01,199
symbiotic bacteria and archaea but they

201
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:03,418
work to suppress pathogens by attracting

202
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,860
microorganisms that are antagonistic to

203
00:07:03,418 --> 00:07:06,839
these pathogens

204
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:08,879
the exudates can adjust the pH of the

205
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:10,799
rhizosphere a fancy word for the area

206
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:12,360
around the roots so the pH could be

207
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,819
buffered into a range that is more

208
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,439
suitable for nutrient uptake that's one

209
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:17,759
of the reasons why organic Growers can

210
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:21,660
get away with growing in Greater pH

211
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:23,580
ranges than say a hydroponic grower

212
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:25,139
so the plant is releasing nutrients to

213
00:07:23,579 --> 00:07:27,598
feed the microbes in the rhizosphere

214
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:30,180
these exudates are being consumed by the

215
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:32,399
bacteria and archae in the soil

216
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:33,780
our care are singer-celled in organisms

217
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:35,818
that initially were classified as

218
00:07:33,779 --> 00:07:38,339
bacteria and originally discovered in

219
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:40,680
deep sea vents they were able to survive

220
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:41,698
in places where no life was thought to

221
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,680
exist

222
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:45,478
now we know they exist everywhere not

223
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,819
just in the soil and the ocean but even

224
00:07:45,478 --> 00:07:49,800
in our stomachs and on our skin and have

225
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:52,080
a variety of roles very similar to

226
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,939
bacteria so from here on out when I

227
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:56,159
mention bacteria you can safely assume

228
00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:58,079
that I'm talking about archaea too

229
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,479
getting back to the soil food web though

230
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:02,639
these bacteria are essentially consuming

231
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:04,500
the root exudates and then some of what

232
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,598
they excrete back into the soil is plant

233
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:08,639
available nutrients meaning it's an

234
00:08:06,598 --> 00:08:10,379
ionic form like phosphate or nitrate

235
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,240
identical to what we are adding when we

236
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:14,159
use chemical fertilizers

237
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,259
now some of these bacteria are being

238
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,939
eaten by larger microorganisms like

239
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:20,639
bacteria feeding nematodes or

240
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:22,918
flagellates or ciliates a bacteria

241
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,560
feeding nematode can feed on up to 5 000

242
00:08:22,918 --> 00:08:27,598
bacterial cells per day which is six and

243
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,759
a half times their own body weight what

244
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:32,278
they then poop out or excrete is plant

245
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,440
available nutrients as well this process

246
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:36,299
is called the microbial Loop or referred

247
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,640
to as nutrient cycling

248
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:40,559
now in addition to all of this bacteria

249
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:43,259
and fungi play major roles as primary

250
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:45,359
decomposers they release enzymes to

251
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:47,220
break down organic matter into inorganic

252
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,019
forms so that these elements and

253
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:51,480
molecules can be released and recycled

254
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:54,120
this is how composting works and why

255
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:56,759
organic matter is so important to soils

256
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,980
taking it a step further when organic

257
00:08:56,759 --> 00:09:01,319
matter becomes humus it is a more stable

258
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:02,940
form of organic matter and it is no

259
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,740
longer identifiable as to what the

260
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:07,260
original source of organic matter was

261
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:10,200
whether it was Leaf litter a dead animal

262
00:09:07,259 --> 00:09:12,600
or an old shoe microscopically it's been

263
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,519
broken down to be indistinguishable but

264
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,259
organic matter in humus is probably its

265
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:19,379
own podcast

266
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:22,259
so the big takeaways are that one the

267
00:09:19,379 --> 00:09:23,879
soul food web is complex and dynamic and

268
00:09:22,259 --> 00:09:26,100
constantly changing

269
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:27,958
two it's the primary way a plant

270
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:31,680
receives nutrients in an organic system

271
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:33,719
called nutrient cycling and three these

272
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:35,338
microbes have roles in protecting the

273
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,620
plant from pathogens and disease

274
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:39,420
creating soil structure and much much

275
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:41,700
more

276
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:43,679
so the soil food web and microbes in

277
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:45,240
general are very important in our soils

278
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:46,979
and soilless media when we are

279
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,259
cultivating using a method like living

280
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:51,360
soils which technically is not a soil

281
00:09:49,259 --> 00:09:53,039
and I don't want to understand how

282
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,379
important the soil food web is to

283
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:57,059
healthy plants I think it's crucial in

284
00:09:55,379 --> 00:09:58,860
all my gardening practices take into

285
00:09:57,059 --> 00:10:00,539
account how they would impact the

286
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,339
microbes in my soil

287
00:10:00,539 --> 00:10:04,379
and again this was not meant to be

288
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:06,240
exhaustive or comprehensive explanation

289
00:10:04,379 --> 00:10:07,679
of the soil food web but I wanted to

290
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,419
give you a foundation that would help

291
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:11,159
explain why don't subscribe to

292
00:10:09,419 --> 00:10:12,899
everything that's being put out there by

293
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:14,939
folks calling themselves soil food web

294
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:16,740
consultants and what I think the limits

295
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:20,100
are to what microbes can consistently

296
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:21,839
and reliably offer us in our garden

297
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,820
so let's talk about some of the basic

298
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,680
concepts or practices we can do to

299
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:27,180
encourage and support the soul food web

300
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:28,819
in our soils

301
00:10:27,179 --> 00:10:31,319
this is pretty straightforward

302
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:33,540
maintaining optimal moisture levels is

303
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:35,278
the absolute most important thing you

304
00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:36,539
can do for microbial life and activity

305
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:38,939
in your soil

306
00:10:36,539 --> 00:10:41,639
water is so critical to not just plants

307
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:43,620
and animals but to microbes as well sure

308
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:45,480
microbes have strategies for dealing

309
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:47,578
with drought such as insisting or going

310
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,959
dormant but if we want to keep nutrients

311
00:10:47,578 --> 00:10:51,179
cycling then we want to keep the

312
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:52,799
microbes alive and happy and if you're

313
00:10:51,179 --> 00:10:55,078
Watering your plants correctly this is

314
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:57,240
really not an issue if soil is just

315
00:10:55,078 --> 00:10:58,859
sitting without a plant in it and I tell

316
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,659
folks it's still treated like it has a

317
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:03,419
plant and keep watering it accordingly

318
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:05,338
if it does dry out say in a bed or a pot

319
00:11:03,419 --> 00:11:08,039
then I suggest adding a handful or two

320
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:09,660
of organic alfalfa meal or watering with

321
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:12,120
a tablespoon per gallon of water with

322
00:11:09,659 --> 00:11:14,100
unsulfured blackstrap molasses something

323
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,839
to get the microbes more active prior to

324
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:18,120
planting but as long as you remember

325
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:21,420
that your soil or soil mix is alive and

326
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:23,519
treated as such you should be fine

327
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:25,679
the next thing is using high quality

328
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:28,139
compost or earthworm castings

329
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:30,299
without going too deep as it's deserving

330
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:32,159
of its own podcast just know that you

331
00:11:30,299 --> 00:11:34,799
want to use compost or castings that are

332
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:37,259
high in biological diversity and overall

333
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:39,179
microbial biomass but also with a

334
00:11:37,259 --> 00:11:40,919
balanced mineral content and there's

335
00:11:39,179 --> 00:11:42,539
ways of testing for some of that but

336
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:43,979
don't think that all compost is created

337
00:11:42,539 --> 00:11:45,899
equal and you can get in a lot of

338
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:47,820
trouble for using bad compost either

339
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:49,379
that's not fully composted or may

340
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:51,660
contain things that you don't want like

341
00:11:49,379 --> 00:11:53,159
herbicides or pesticides that have not

342
00:11:51,659 --> 00:11:55,379
fully broken down in the composting

343
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:57,778
process or even things like weed seeds

344
00:11:55,379 --> 00:11:59,759
which can be really annoying compost can

345
00:11:57,778 --> 00:12:01,620
also contain harmful pathogens so

346
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:03,480
understanding what the inputs are and

347
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:06,060
how it's made is really important you

348
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:07,500
really have to trust your source

349
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:09,838
and then one last thing I'd like to

350
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:11,940
highlight is soil disturbance tilling

351
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,279
soils can be very destructive to soil

352
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:15,839
structure and soil biology there are

353
00:12:14,278 --> 00:12:17,759
times when I think it's necessary to

354
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,980
till but let's not confuse tilling with

355
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:22,019
a mechanical tiller to what we may have

356
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:24,480
to do in a bed with digging in nutrients

357
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:26,278
they are not the same thing I have a

358
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,959
whole blog on this topic on our website

359
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:30,539
if you want to read more

360
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:32,399
and some Souls of disturbance may be

361
00:12:30,539 --> 00:12:34,799
beneficial to the Ecology of your soil

362
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,600
not all disturbance is a bad thing it

363
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:39,299
adds benefits too like the potential to

364
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:41,459
encourage microbial diversity just know

365
00:12:39,299 --> 00:12:42,899
that microbes play a big role in soil

366
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:44,099
structure and we want to support that

367
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:46,379
process

368
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,940
oh and if you can always keep a plant in

369
00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:49,799
your soil this will encourage healthy

370
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:51,720
microbial communities due to the

371
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:53,159
relationship between the plant and its

372
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,440
ability to continue tributing to

373
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:57,719
nutrient cycling as I mentioned in the

374
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,940
beginning of this podcast

375
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,920
so why is any of this controversial it

376
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:04,320
seems pretty straightforward right and

377
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:05,578
it is everything that I shared above has

378
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,820
been established and is generally

379
00:13:05,578 --> 00:13:10,319
accepted by soil scientists universally

380
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:12,800
now here's where it gets a bit more

381
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,800
complicated

382
00:13:16,339 --> 00:13:21,300
alright so that was the first part of my

383
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:23,100
podcast on the soil food web I hope you

384
00:13:21,299 --> 00:13:24,778
found it interesting and apologies for

385
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:26,940
the vocal quality I'm recovering from

386
00:13:24,778 --> 00:13:29,100
covet as I record this and I'm still a

387
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:30,839
bit stuffed up and out of breath if you
