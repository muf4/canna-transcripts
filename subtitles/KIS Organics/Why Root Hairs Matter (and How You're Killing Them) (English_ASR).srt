1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,960
every time I water my plants I think

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:08,199
about root hairs when you pull a healthy

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:09,960
plant out of a pot or out of the ground

4
00:00:08,199 --> 00:00:12,239
and you see those tiny fuzzy white

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,839
strands coming out of the root those are

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,160
your root hairs root hairs are lateral

7
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:19,079
extensions of a single cell and the

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,759
primary source of water and nutrient

9
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:23,679
uptake root hairs are the main interface

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,480
with the rizosphere the area around the

11
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:28,559
roots and where interactions with

12
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:30,640
microbes and soil minerals occur so why

13
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:32,238
root hairs every time I water

14
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,600
well I'm not really thinking about root

15
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:36,718
hairs so much as I am about root hair

16
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,679
death now root hairs have a limited

17
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,120
lifespan and plants are constantly

18
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:42,558
generating new ones as old ones die but

19
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:45,479
there's also things that we do as

20
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:47,558
Growers that kill root hairs effectively

21
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:50,319
limiting water and nutrient uptake to

22
00:00:47,558 --> 00:00:52,919
our plants stressful conditions like

23
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,480
extreme soil temperatures nutrient

24
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,079
deficiencies or toxicities and watering

25
00:00:55,479 --> 00:01:00,959
play a key role in root hair Health but

26
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,239
here's why I think about it when I'm in

27
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,840
my botney professor Don Marshall used to

28
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:07,879
say that overwatering and underwatering

29
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,920
cause the same above ground symptoms in

30
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:11,879
plants so you cannot tell if a plant has

31
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,840
been over or underwatered simply by

32
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:17,359
looking at it why because both over and

33
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:19,560
underwatering cause root hair death and

34
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:21,920
the plant is not able to uptake

35
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,519
nutrients and water as efficiently until

36
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,759
those root hairs regrow so understanding

37
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:28,959
the why or the mechanism behind what we

38
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:30,200
do as Growers can be useful and improve

39
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:32,679
our ability to grow health healthy

40
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,478
plants so next time you're watering I

41
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,200
encourage you to think about root hairs

42
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:40,239
and root hair death and the role you

43
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,240
play in your plant's health
