spent the last six years with galenus um

or certified organic grow in akan Ohio

57
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:21,759
and prior to that I worked in vegetable

58
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,239
farming for Great Lakes Brewing Company

59
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:27,239
spent 13 years in the field growing 30

60
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:30,200
or 40 different crops and just learning

61
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:33,239
how to grow vegetables hops p pumpkins

62
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:34,919
for the pumpkin ale things like that and

63
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:37,680
um I've also worked in policy quite a

64
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:40,119
bit worked for marijuana policy project

65
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,920
um created a network of signature

66
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,560
gatherers for various campaigns to

67
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:47,919
legalize medical marijuana did some

68
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,719
lobbying um lobi in DC and spent some

69
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:53,238
time really just kind of building

70
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:55,000
networks of activists to help um

71
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:58,039
essentially legalized medical marijuana

72
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,280
in Ohio which now led to our adult useth

73
00:02:58,039 --> 00:03:03,039
legalization as well um I have three

74
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,799
children three wonderful children I even

75
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:08,280
have my first grandchild now so I've

76
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:10,040
spent a lot long time raising kids and

77
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,000
growing healthy foods for all of them to

78
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:14,199
eat as well and been involved with food

79
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,519
policy and food access in neighborhoods

80
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:18,000
where I

81
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:22,719
live oh that's great I I wanted to ask

82
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,719
you so prior to getting into uh galenus

83
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:25,840
had you grown cannabis because it sounds

84
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:29,239
like your background is really in

85
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:31,479
vegetable production yeah so primarily

86
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:34,200
I've focused on vegetable production and

87
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:38,518
really that ties back into raising

88
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:41,318
children so I did grow cannabis um when

89
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:43,039
I was very young and you know I was part

90
00:03:41,318 --> 00:03:46,518
of the marijuana culture I would say

91
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:48,798
from a teenager on and then when my

92
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:51,680
children were born I decided it wasn't

93
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:53,599
worth the risk essentially Ohio's been a

94
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,760
Prohibition state for a very long time

95
00:03:53,598 --> 00:04:00,560
and um for me personally the two just

96
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:03,679
couldn't work together couldn't coexist

97
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,280
so I took my energy of wanting to grow

98
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,040
cannabis and put it into vegetable

99
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:11,120
production until legalization passed and

100
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:12,719
then was able to finally dive full in on

101
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,640
legal cannabis

102
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:17,199
production okay so you had some

103
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:19,319
familiarity with the plant um and some

104
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,720
of the differences between that and say

105
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:23,519
you know some of these vegetable crops

106
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:27,000
like like pumpkins and and uh you

107
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:29,120
mentioned Hops uh how did that

108
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,759
experience you know coming from

109
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,120
agriculture

110
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:35,439
help you when you move to I I mean

111
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,759
you're moving from outdoor production

112
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:39,918
too it sounds like to controlled

113
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:41,479
environment agriculture indoors um how

114
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:43,319
did that process help you and what

115
00:04:41,478 --> 00:04:47,319
things were did you kind of have to get

116
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:50,399
to speed on so it definitely prepared me

117
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:53,038
quite a bit um it growing so many

118
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:56,359
different vegetables too like in a more

119
00:04:53,038 --> 00:04:59,199
polyculture Farm setting I think I just

120
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:02,639
learned the essentials of what plants

121
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:04,439
crave what they need to grow so I was

122
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:07,000
pretty well versed on growing everything

123
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:09,759
from like spring crops and coal crops to

124
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,680
tomatoes um hops which are totally

125
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,680
different perennials fruit trees I just

126
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:17,439
became sort of well-versed in Plants

127
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:21,240
overall but I was concerned for sure

128
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:23,360
when I moved into indoor agriculture um

129
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,800
and just because I didn't essentially

130
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,000
grow cannabis myself at home during

131
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,960
those years while I was growing

132
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,959
vegetables I definitely assisted uh some

133
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:34,519
other people in growing cannabis so I

134
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:37,799
had close friends of course that were

135
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:40,240
Growers and um spent quite a bit of time

136
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,600
learning from them and kind of preparing

137
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:46,639
myself for when I would be able to grow

138
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:48,759
commercially but moving into indoor

139
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:52,038
production my biggest concern when I

140
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:54,038
moved from Outdoors indoors really was

141
00:05:52,038 --> 00:05:57,120
can I do the same things that I'm doing

142
00:05:54,038 --> 00:06:00,279
outside inside without running the risk

143
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,079
of failing crops for microbial I mean

144
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:03,959
that was honestly my biggest risk

145
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:06,240
because I've always grown organically

146
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:09,239
I've always had like this soil food web

147
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:12,199
sort of production model and I was

148
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:15,360
definitely very concerned that I would

149
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:20,800
have problems failing for beneficial

150
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:24,120
bacteria essentially or fungi and that

151
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,199
fear um led me to be more restrictive

152
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,879
over what things I used indoors until I

153
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:29,439
started passing some tests and making

154
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:32,240
sure that I was going to be able to kind

155
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:34,360
of used the same systems that I had used

156
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,800
outside but of course it was a big

157
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,520
adjustment and I think some things I

158
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,919
found are a lot easier like of course

159
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:41,959
you're not dealing with the weather and

160
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:44,439
the rain and you're able to control the

161
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:46,279
climate and that makes a huge difference

162
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:49,360
and some things have been a little more

163
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:52,559
challenging like just like using soil

164
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,038
managing the dust really is a big thing

165
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,839
um so when you're transplanting when

166
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:58,839
you're moving soil throughout a

167
00:06:55,839 --> 00:07:02,198
building being very cautious as to where

168
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:05,318
those dusts are going and doing a ton of

169
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:08,319
Sanitation of course to stay on top of

170
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:10,400
um the residues and buildups that you

171
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,720
can get from using soil in an indoor

172
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:15,318
operation have been a challenge but um

173
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,759
we've been very successful we have a 95%

174
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:20,720
pass rate over the past six years which

175
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:24,520
I think is very good for living soil

176
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:26,759
indoors and um we also have the benefit

177
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:29,038
of having like a really nice tur profile

178
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:31,120
yields and just kind of an overall very

179
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:32,360
high quality that we've established

180
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,360
which I think a lot of that is

181
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:37,639
attributed to the compost based mediums

182
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,160
and and different uh techniques that

183
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:41,079
we're using indoors that our competitors

184
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,800
essentially

185
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:47,038
aren't now you have you have the added

186
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:49,800
challenge of Ohio regulations to where

187
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:52,199
you had to build vertically correct

188
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,478
correct um yes just because of the way

189
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:55,319
the laws are structured can you talk

190
00:07:53,478 --> 00:07:58,360
about that a little bit describe what

191
00:07:55,319 --> 00:08:02,280
your facility looks like yeah so Ohio

192
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:04,280
has uh different regulation model um

193
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:05,839
they're not limited by plant count or

194
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:08,239
regulated by plant count and they're

195
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:13,478
also not regulated by canopy size but

196
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:15,319
rather by regulated room footprint So

197
00:08:13,478 --> 00:08:19,240
currently there was well there was two

198
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:22,520
two tiers of medical um cultivation size

199
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:24,720
one was 25,000 square foot of indoor

200
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:26,959
regulated room the other was 3,000

201
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,960
square foot so I'm in the smaller Grove

202
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:32,559
which was the 3,000 square foot but the

203
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:36,759
ownership group of the company decided

204
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:40,478
to um essentially exploit that legally

205
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:43,838
compliantly by building vertically um I

206
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:45,959
know that uh I think flora and Flame

207
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:49,040
which was a guest um previously on your

208
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:50,958
show the head cultivator there spoke

209
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:56,000
about their grow being modeled after the

210
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:58,719
Grove in Las Vegas um so galenus where I

211
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,200
work was also modeled after that grow

212
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,519
which I think is kind of a common theme

213
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:06,360
for this being a new style of producing

214
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:08,759
cannabis indoors and so it was built

215
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,879
designed to have three growing tiers in

216
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:13,559
each of the two flower rooms so the two

217
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:16,838
flower rooms are both 1500 square foot

218
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:20,359
but have three tiers of cultivation um

219
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:22,160
across the you know vertically and so

220
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:24,278
we're essentially growing on all those

221
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:27,439
three tier so we're really operating at

222
00:09:24,278 --> 00:09:32,200
essentially 9,000 square foot of growing

223
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:35,000
space but only 3,000 square foot of room

224
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:37,920
footprint and tell me a little bit about

225
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,480
your cultivation method so you mentioned

226
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:43,599
living soil you are in containers some

227
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,680
people have pushed back on this idea of

228
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,920
living

229
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:50,439
soils being in containers saying you

230
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:53,360
know if you're truly living soil you're

231
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:55,240
reusing the soil you're in beds um I

232
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,759
don't get quite as caught up in the

233
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:59,560
those semantics um so I'm fine with you

234
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:01,759
using the term living soil I think as

235
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:04,639
long as you're focused on cultivating

236
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:06,439
with Biology in mind with the concept of

237
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:08,319
nutrient cycling coming from the

238
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:11,480
microbes in your soil then that soil's

239
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,600
alive and it's living soil so what um

240
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:16,800
what SI containers are you using what

241
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,839
does that process sort of look like so

242
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:21,199
yeah the the living soil thing is

243
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:24,399
definitely a a term that I had never

244
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,360
used prior to coming into cannabis um so

245
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,078
like a compost-based medium or

246
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,759
compost-based potting soil is probably

247
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:33,319
the more accurate term um living soil

248
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:35,480
and what exactly that implies I don't

249
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:37,959
know if that's defined by pot size or

250
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:39,839
exactly the the parameters around

251
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:41,799
officially using that term but it's

252
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,839
definitely something very commonly used

253
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:47,399
in the um cannabis industry and so I

254
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:50,560
guess I've adopted it a bit but um we're

255
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:54,480
currently growing in 10 and 15 gallon

256
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:55,359
pots when I first started the facility

257
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,360
was

258
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:01,159
using five gallon fabric pots and they

259
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:05,720
were running

260
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:08,319
2,000 plants per room I've since over

261
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:12,278
the course of 5 years reduced the number

262
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:15,600
of plants down to 744 per room so it was

263
00:11:12,278 --> 00:11:17,439
a substantial reduction in plant count

264
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:21,040
um I know that there are definitely

265
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:24,800
trends that point or or data that points

266
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:27,319
to more of a sea of green and having a

267
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:30,039
larger population of plants that are

268
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:32,720
much smaller in size can um achieve

269
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:35,159
higher yields in certain systems and I

270
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:39,639
think that there's definitely a place

271
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:41,679
for that and um that's potentially a way

272
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:43,959
to achieve greater yields in certain

273
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:46,319
systems but our building was designed

274
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:51,278
essentially for larger plants because

275
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:53,040
the tiers are s feet apart um and also

276
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:54,559
they didn't have gutters so they were

277
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:56,799
not designed for like an automated

278
00:11:54,559 --> 00:12:01,319
watering system

279
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:03,719
so my strategy was to reduce the touch

280
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:05,320
points essentially that people are

281
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:08,000
having to do because labor being one of

282
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:10,600
our greatest cost it made the most sense

283
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,360
to when you have to take all of your

284
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:15,560
plants and put them on a scissor lift

285
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:17,278
and lift them up 10 and 20 plus feet

286
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:19,719
into the air and then set them on a

287
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:23,679
bench and repeat that cycle every 60

288
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:26,360
days it made more sense um for us to be

289
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:28,879
using less plants per bench but in a

290
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:30,560
bigger pot the advantage to that also is

291
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:33,519
that is a bigger pot and there's more

292
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:36,958
soil so the plant biology I'm sorry the

293
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:38,600
soil biology can stay alive more easily

294
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:41,719
it's more stable because it's in this

295
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:43,800
larger pot so we use 15 gallon pots on

296
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,759
the on the bottom tier and then we use

297
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:49,639
10 gallon pots on the second and third

298
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:52,120
tier and I've seen a slightly larger

299
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:54,919
increase in yield per plant in the 15

300
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:57,159
gallon over the 10 gallon it does depend

301
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:58,879
on the cultivar so I've seen some

302
00:12:57,159 --> 00:13:01,399
cultivars that actually produce slightly

303
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:04,799
higher at 10 10 gallons but the majority

304
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:07,480
of them produce roughly 5% higher yield

305
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:10,958
in the 15 gallon over the 10 gallon but

306
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:14,399
in both size pots we're able to really

307
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:17,078
keep the soil microbiology very stable

308
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:20,240
and also have the watering cycle that is

309
00:13:17,078 --> 00:13:22,159
the most efficient for our team um this

310
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:26,519
was also as most of the decisions I've

311
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:28,198
made in the facility very team driven so

312
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:30,120
you know I go to the cultivation

313
00:13:28,198 --> 00:13:33,319
technicians hey what would you rather do

314
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:35,440
lift 20 plants 20 pots that are lighter

315
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:37,278
onto a bench or 10 pots that are heavier

316
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,519
and the consensus was always 10 pots

317
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:43,480
that are heavier so um it's more

318
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:46,799
efficient we're able to load a room in

319
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:50,759
essentially 12 hours and we're able to

320
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:52,559
offload a room in four hours so that's

321
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:54,240
been the most efficient method we found

322
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:57,278
and I also like the stability of the

323
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:59,120
soil and all the other things that we do

324
00:13:57,278 --> 00:14:01,519
have less touch points so like when we

325
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:05,320
take moisture readings for example like

326
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:08,159
we use a a a a moisture reader to

327
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:10,680
determine how much water we should water

328
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:13,000
in that the next watering we can take a

329
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:16,319
smaller sampling and still get a good

330
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,799
look at where each cultivar is um as far

331
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,800
as moisture

332
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:25,078
levels so one thing I would think would

333
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:27,480
be more apparent would be any sort of

334
00:14:25,078 --> 00:14:29,239
nutrient deficiency or issue that you

335
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,920
may have I would expect to see it in the

336
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:34,639
10 gallon pot sooner than the 15 across

337
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:36,479
the same cultivar uh that's the biggest

338
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:39,198
Advantage I've seen to more soil is just

339
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,360
sort of a that buffering effect in terms

340
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:42,399
of deficiency or nutrient uptake what

341
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,360
what are your experience with that

342
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,879
though yeah I definitely agree with that

343
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:49,879
and we do see this the deficiencies that

344
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:52,120
do pop up more quickly in the 10 gallons

345
00:14:49,879 --> 00:14:54,480
um we do sometimes actually see higher

346
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:56,399
potency in the 10 gallons over the 15

347
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,639
gallons and I feel like that's directly

348
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:01,399
related because of course if you have an

349
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:03,799
excess of nitrogen from my experience

350
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:05,559
I've always seen that plants if we feed

351
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:07,240
a little too much nitrogen in or if the

352
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:10,119
soil had a little too much nitrogen to

353
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:11,799
begin with that we see a drop in potency

354
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:14,399
um so I do believe that's like an you

355
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:17,159
know fairly well established inverse

356
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:20,799
relationship um so we do see more

357
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:23,639
deficiency earlier in the 10 but um they

358
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:26,359
do also have different dry backbacks and

359
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:30,240
that I think attributes sometimes to or

360
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:31,839
you know generally to um uptake of

361
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,278
course so you know if the plant stays a

362
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:36,160
little bit too dry for too long then

363
00:15:34,278 --> 00:15:42,039
that deficiency could essentially be a

364
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:44,318
dry back issue versus a soil fertility

365
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:46,559
issue yeah I would think maybe the in

366
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:50,958
the 10 gallons in addition to nitrogen

367
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:54,318
just the uh plant stress you may have

368
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:55,919
you know unintentional Str plant stress

369
00:15:54,318 --> 00:15:58,078
through maybe osmotic pressure on the

370
00:15:55,919 --> 00:16:00,360
roots or something related to your

371
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:03,078
watering or a lack of nutrients due to

372
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:06,800
the smaller pot that may lead to

373
00:16:03,078 --> 00:16:10,519
higher you know translate to higher

374
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:13,399
canono levels like you were saying um

375
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:17,039
typically at the expense of yields I

376
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:18,399
would say uh could be the case but um

377
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:21,039
yeah no I think that's an interesting

378
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:23,000
comparison between 10 and 15 or or let's

379
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:25,360
just say a larger versus smaller

380
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,240
container size with with what we're

381
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:31,919
calling living soils correct yes

382
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:35,120
definitely yeah I think that um

383
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:37,919
ultimately as we expand and we move into

384
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,198
four flower rooms or six flower rooms

385
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:41,919
will probably go to a 10 gallon only

386
00:16:40,198 --> 00:16:44,679
just to keep everything completely the

387
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:47,559
same because obviously the more

388
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:49,439
differences you have in your system the

389
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:51,318
more accommodations you have to make in

390
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,000
your schedules and into the attention

391
00:16:51,318 --> 00:16:55,599
that you're giving the plants so we

392
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,360
would probably move to 10 gallons um for

393
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:01,120
the whole operation but it I think it's

394
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:02,839
a pretty happy medium a 10 gallon prior

395
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,558
to a 10 gallon I was using a 6 and a

396
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:07,640
half gallon and I definitely saw more

397
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:11,318
issues with deficiency than now I see a

398
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:13,880
10 a 10 is more stable um we have 4 by

399
00:17:11,318 --> 00:17:17,519
eight benches and 10 10 on that 4 by8

400
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:21,000
bench works pretty well with the canopy

401
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:22,519
filling out without having any um which

402
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,359
without having the plants obviously too

403
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:27,400
crowded and enough room to work so that

404
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:30,839
you can access all sides of the plants

405
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,840
and have the right air flow

406
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,240
so you're not going water only

407
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:39,480
throughout the grow cycle in that 10

408
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:41,079
though either is that corre no correct

409
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:44,120
yeah so we definitely start with a

410
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:47,798
pretty heavily fortified soil it's 25

411
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:50,399
roughly 25% compost-based um is a soil

412
00:17:47,798 --> 00:17:53,160
that I've worked with a local soil maker

413
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,880
to be used specifically for cannabis

414
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:58,400
production and it was a process that

415
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:01,640
probably took us a full two years to

416
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:05,759
fully develop um so we kind of started

417
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:09,640
with their base soil and added some more

418
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:11,480
more fertility a little more Iration um

419
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:13,320
and got it to where we wanted with the

420
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:16,400
dryback and then just like focused a

421
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:19,038
little bit more on individual

422
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:21,240
nutrients excuse me and making sure that

423
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:22,960
we had exactly what we wanted with the

424
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:25,480
fertility levels and that was based

425
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:28,600
really on tissue testing you know mid

426
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:30,599
cycle late cycle testing spent soil at

427
00:18:28,599 --> 00:18:34,678
the end and seeing what was left and

428
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:36,879
what we started with and then um we as I

429
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:39,559
mentioned we worked with that soil maker

430
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:41,840
to really develop it how we wanted to

431
00:18:39,558 --> 00:18:45,519
and then after that I

432
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:48,839
decided basically that one top dress per

433
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:50,759
cycle with a granular I use a a granular

434
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:53,079
um chicken manure based fertilizer

435
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:56,240
that's also made here in Ohio that one

436
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:58,439
top dress at week two was about the

437
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:02,798
right amount of additional fertilizer

438
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:04,480
that we haded to add in a dry um form

439
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:07,960
but then we also take that same

440
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:10,240
fertilizer and weekly from week two

441
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:15,360
through week seven I take that same

442
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:18,120
granular fertilizer I mix it in a brute

443
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:20,399
um container 44 gallon brute container

444
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:23,239
and put it on a bubbler overnight so we

445
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,679
do maybe eight of those brutes per room

446
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:26,720
bubble it overnight which really

447
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:28,759
essentially is just breaking it down and

448
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,960
probably doing some level of nitrogen

449
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:35,879
conversion and then we give each plant a

450
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:38,319
liter of that liquid once per week from

451
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:40,280
week two through week seven so that's

452
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:44,038
essentially all the additional nutrient

453
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:46,480
that we water into the soil and I've

454
00:19:44,038 --> 00:19:50,000
tried I've done quite a few different

455
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:51,960
little R&amp;D trials with just loading all

456
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,400
of that nutrient in on the front end

457
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:56,679
into the soil and definitely not had

458
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:59,000
nearly the same results as when we sort

459
00:19:56,679 --> 00:20:03,759
of spoon feed it on a weekly basis in

460
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:07,558
this partially decomposed way um I do

461
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:11,119
also push a lot of worm castings so the

462
00:20:07,558 --> 00:20:13,839
worm castings are also made into a

463
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:17,599
liquid not a tea exactly but just an

464
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:20,720
extract and so in veg I like to really

465
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:23,558
feed in a lot of worm casting extract

466
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:26,798
and then I do taper that off at the

467
00:20:23,558 --> 00:20:28,240
beginning of flower but um I also do a

468
00:20:26,798 --> 00:20:30,240
little bit of foler feeding with a

469
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:33,159
couple different products that I like

470
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:35,880
for just kind of the beginning of the

471
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:37,799
cycle and so those folar feeds which are

472
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:40,400
essentially just like a soy protein

473
00:20:37,798 --> 00:20:44,879
hydrolysate and a potassium product that

474
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:48,679
I like uh quite a bit I use those Al of

475
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:51,760
course certified organic products in veg

476
00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:54,080
through week one of flour and then

477
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:55,720
that's the only other nutrient that the

478
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:57,839
plants get and again it's it's more

479
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:59,558
frontloading it in the vegetative cycle

480
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:02,480
to like build build that structure that

481
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:04,399
we're looking for in the flower uh in

482
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,279
the flower

483
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:10,240
finish yeah you brought up some good

484
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:12,278
points uh in there I think the first one

485
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:15,599
I want to highlight is this idea that if

486
00:21:12,278 --> 00:21:17,798
you are in a container and I I look at a

487
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:20,719
10 gallon container as sort of a smaller

488
00:21:17,798 --> 00:21:22,960
size relatively speaking for for growing

489
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,679
in what we're call in living soil here

490
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,000
um you will probably get much better

491
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,559
results you may be able to make it

492
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,278
through a whole cycle water only

493
00:21:28,558 --> 00:21:33,720
depending on lighting you know um CO2

494
00:21:32,278 --> 00:21:36,440
levels those sorts of other limiting

495
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:39,880
factors uh how you're watering but if

496
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:41,840
you can add fertility slowly throughout

497
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,440
that cycle I I would absolutely expect

498
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:46,119
to get better results so I think that's

499
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:48,400
a really good point to highlight um did

500
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:50,918
you want to touch on that before I um no

501
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:53,200
I I would just just say that you know in

502
00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:54,919
the side by sides that we've done of

503
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,640
putting that nutrient this the equal

504
00:21:54,919 --> 00:21:59,520
amount of nutrient in the front end I

505
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:02,640
mean the yield was almost half of what

506
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:04,639
it was when we add it in Little Bits

507
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,759
throughout the cycle so I it's a pretty

508
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:09,159
dramatic difference that I've seen from

509
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:12,960
doing it that way are you watering to

510
00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:14,840
run off as well so we we are essentially

511
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:18,319
watering to run off but there's very

512
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:21,480
little runoff okay so I like we we have

513
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:24,079
a saucer underneath each plant um so

514
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:26,759
there's no like run to waste so whatever

515
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:27,519
does run off is recaptured and reused by

516
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:32,319
the

517
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:36,359
plant interesting okay and mov going

518
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:37,798
back to your um formulation of a soil

519
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:39,000
you said it took about two years and I

520
00:22:37,798 --> 00:22:40,480
think that's really interesting because

521
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,200
that's the number that I throw out to

522
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:45,240
people when I say what it should take to

523
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:47,440
formulate a soil uh and it sounds like

524
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:49,159
we had a similar process a thought

525
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,720
process so you start with like a what I

526
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:53,640
would call a base mix um so for us

527
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:57,159
that's something usually around Pete

528
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:59,880
Moss pmus and a compost um and then we

529
00:22:57,159 --> 00:23:02,360
add fertility to that and then we we

530
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:04,278
test and just turn one dial at a time

531
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:06,119
and once we get it kind of where we want

532
00:23:04,278 --> 00:23:09,119
it then we start running plant trials

533
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:12,479
and then further refine the process uh

534
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:13,359
and it just takes a long time yes go

535
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,919
ahead is there anything you want to add

536
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:17,359
to that um no I would just say it takes

537
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:21,278
a lot of time and it takes a lot of

538
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:23,119
testing and R&amp;D in general is really

539
00:23:21,278 --> 00:23:25,880
difficult in a production facility I

540
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:27,839
mean looking back you know like if I

541
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:29,799
could redesign the facility that we're

542
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:31,839
in would definitely build out a small

543
00:23:29,798 --> 00:23:34,359
R&amp;D room because I think if you have

544
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:37,399
your own R&amp;D room and you can trial

545
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:39,199
things on like a 10 or 20 plant basis

546
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:41,038
and take that testing you could really

547
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,240
move things forward a lot more quickly

548
00:23:41,038 --> 00:23:45,640
than you can when every square foot

549
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:47,480
counts in your production facility so in

550
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:49,360
your production facility you're really

551
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:52,079
your hands are kind of tied in the sense

552
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:53,959
that you can only play around with so

553
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:56,720
many things per cycle you know and for

554
00:23:53,960 --> 00:24:00,720
me that's generally maybe 10 plants 10

555
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:02,640
to 20 plants a cycle so I would much

556
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,919
rather be able to do that outside of the

557
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:07,520
production space and be able to just

558
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:10,000
have side by sides running all the time

559
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:12,240
and even the other issue with R&amp;D is

560
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:16,359
just really especially now when we have

561
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:17,880
a team that's just so dialed in is just

562
00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:19,240
you know oh you can only do this for

563
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,760
this plant you have to do this

564
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:23,038
differently for this plant you know it's

565
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:25,879
just hard to stay as efficient of course

566
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:28,839
with your task delegation when you have

567
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:31,440
um R&amp;D going now our teams been really

568
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:33,839
creative and figuring out how to uh make

569
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,120
little signs and markers and tags and

570
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:36,918
things like that for plants that are

571
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:39,079
supposed to get some sort of special

572
00:24:36,919 --> 00:24:41,399
instructions and we have been able to

573
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:43,398
collect much better data now that we

574
00:24:41,398 --> 00:24:45,599
have like this team that's really well

575
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:48,639
established and knows what they're doing

576
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:49,798
um so it it definitely can be done but

577
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,919
it's always

578
00:24:49,798 --> 00:24:54,679
challenging the the bigger part of it

579
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:57,038
too is the testing you know so like the

580
00:24:54,679 --> 00:24:58,919
extra expense of testing 10 plants

581
00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:00,519
specifically and now what are we doing

582
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:02,360
with that small batch how is it going to

583
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:03,440
be sold what if the test results are

584
00:25:02,359 --> 00:25:05,719
different and we don't want to release

585
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:08,480
it onto the market so then that small

586
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:10,360
batch has to essentially be be frozen or

587
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:13,200
used for a different purpose so I mean

588
00:25:10,359 --> 00:25:16,359
it has um challenges all the way down

589
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:19,080
the cycle that make it just take more

590
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:21,558
time and cost more money so it is

591
00:25:19,079 --> 00:25:23,839
difficult but um we've definitely been

592
00:25:21,558 --> 00:25:25,918
able to do a fair share of it and I

593
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:28,519
think that as long as you're really

594
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:31,159
being dilig diligent about capturing the

595
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:32,480
data that that's the most important part

596
00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:34,278
because it's easy to start the

597
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:37,079
experiment but it's harder to see it all

598
00:25:34,278 --> 00:25:39,119
the way through and then analyze the

599
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:40,960
data and sometimes it's really Cult of

600
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:43,798
art dependent you know so that makes a

601
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:46,558
big difference as well so it gets tricky

602
00:25:43,798 --> 00:25:48,960
but um with the soil process yeah I

603
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:51,519
would say that took us a solid two years

604
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:54,038
and we still it's still it's ongoing so

605
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:56,240
you know there's times when a supply

606
00:25:54,038 --> 00:25:58,679
input may change and say well we have to

607
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:02,440
shift to this and so now we have to kind

608
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:05,320
of start the process again or um in

609
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:07,399
certain situations we realize that

610
00:26:05,319 --> 00:26:09,278
something is occurring that we want to

611
00:26:07,398 --> 00:26:12,038
improve again slightly upon whether it's

612
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:13,759
usually like paracity drainage dryback

613
00:26:12,038 --> 00:26:16,599
things like that more so than nutrient

614
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:18,359
levels and I feel pretty locked in on

615
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:20,599
our nutrient levels at this point just

616
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:23,319
because we get such cons consistent High

617
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:25,079
potency and we also just get the yields

618
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:29,158
that are achieving our goals all the

619
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:30,439
time um but there's always a question in

620
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:31,960
the back of your mind well what if we

621
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:33,960
tried a little bit more of this where

622
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:36,880
would it go you know so it's it's an

623
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:38,720
ongoing process and I think that um

624
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,440
there's that it should always continue

625
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,240
because the research and development is

626
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:44,200
what you can't break the barrier until

627
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:47,599
you've tried something

628
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:50,960
new yeah and we talk about these inputs

629
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:52,759
uh you know fertilizers compost castings

630
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,960
all these things like they're uh

631
00:26:52,759 --> 00:26:56,640
consistent and they're homogeneous and

632
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,840
in the real world frankly they aren't

633
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,559
and that does require testing

634
00:26:58,839 --> 00:27:02,519
so I think that is important and that's

635
00:27:01,558 --> 00:27:04,158
what you're paying for when you buy

636
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:07,398
commercial soil is that the company has

637
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:09,000
done that testing for you so to ask for

638
00:27:07,398 --> 00:27:12,479
testing results I think is a very

639
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,359
reasonable request um and expectation

640
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,440
and then understanding how to interpret

641
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:18,519
those results because I've seen tests

642
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:21,640
tests that have been put out publicly by

643
00:27:18,519 --> 00:27:24,960
various companies that highlight issues

644
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:27,080
in my in in my experience yet um they're

645
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,600
being promoted as a good test so I think

646
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:31,599
understanding how to read a test is a

647
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:36,879
really important skill for sure

648
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:38,879
just it's more so it's also not just um

649
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,960
the batch testing that you're seeing but

650
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,080
even and I found this with some of the

651
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:45,600
oil uh other soil manufacturers that I

652
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:47,759
worked with previously is that the

653
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:50,359
quality control of the product you know

654
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:53,240
so like you might get the batch testing

655
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:54,959
every year but your soil might come in

656
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:56,679
in a different state than it had other

657
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,278
times and I've had problems just like

658
00:27:56,679 --> 00:27:59,720
with vegetable production because I

659
00:27:58,278 --> 00:28:01,398
always started all my plants in a

660
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:03,798
greenhouse from seed every year and I'm

661
00:28:01,398 --> 00:28:05,719
talking about like 10,000 plants um

662
00:28:03,798 --> 00:28:07,200
where some years the the soil just

663
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:09,798
wasn't of the same quality whether it

664
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:13,200
was too hot or it you know had a

665
00:28:09,798 --> 00:28:16,240
different moisture um was able to hold

666
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:18,120
moisture differently that the quality

667
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,480
control from batch to batch is really

668
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:21,839
important and I worry sometimes because

669
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,278
I'm working with a very small soil

670
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:26,079
provider that as these companies grow

671
00:28:24,278 --> 00:28:28,640
and get really big and start supplying

672
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:30,558
soil to the all over the country can

673
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:34,080
they maintain that same level of quality

674
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:36,119
control and I think that's really

675
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:39,759
important yeah the other thing I want to

676
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:42,079
touch on was you were talking about um

677
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:43,759
figuring out what the soil got you for

678
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:46,319
dry backs and essentially what you were

679
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:48,119
you were highlighting is what are the

680
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:51,079
physical properties of this soil does it

681
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:54,558
have the right levels of paracity and

682
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:57,119
gas exchange and water retention uh that

683
00:28:54,558 --> 00:28:58,918
I want and then from there you started

684
00:28:57,119 --> 00:29:00,719
looking at fertility which is sort of

685
00:28:58,919 --> 00:29:02,640
the chemical analysis what we would get

686
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,798
back from on a soil test report looking

687
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,759
at levels of you know C calcium

688
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:09,319
magnesium potassium nitrogen all of

689
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:10,558
these things and balancing those second

690
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:12,879
and I think that's really important

691
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:14,918
because there's sort of really I look at

692
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,320
it like a triangle where we have the

693
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:19,278
when we talk about soils we're looking

694
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:21,879
at chemical physical and

695
00:29:19,278 --> 00:29:24,440
biological um properties of soils and

696
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:28,679
those are really the that's how I like

697
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:32,080
to approach I guess soil mixing or or so

698
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:35,880
formulation definitely yeah I agree I

699
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:38,599
mean it's it's a complex product it's

700
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:41,679
it's really not very simple and

701
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:44,639
straightforward and I think that um when

702
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:47,120
we started the soils that I first was

703
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:49,399
triing were essentially just too heavy

704
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:51,759
for the most part and I needed to

705
00:29:49,398 --> 00:29:54,359
lighten them up more and we work to you

706
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:56,599
know like add some different essentially

707
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:59,000
like more perlite and different things

708
00:29:56,599 --> 00:30:01,119
that could open up the it of the soil a

709
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,079
little bit more because I really think

710
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:06,798
that dryback that you're looking for is

711
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:08,278
is very important and if you can't get

712
00:30:06,798 --> 00:30:09,720
and I know I've already said this but if

713
00:30:08,278 --> 00:30:11,640
you can't get the watering and the

714
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:13,798
dryback right then you just really start

715
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:16,880
to see a lot of nutrient problems and I

716
00:30:13,798 --> 00:30:18,759
think oftentimes Growers are F focused

717
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:22,039
more on the nutrient issues than they

718
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:24,558
are just simply on the water holding

719
00:30:22,038 --> 00:30:26,798
capacity of the medium this is so

720
00:30:24,558 --> 00:30:30,798
important so when you say dryback you're

721
00:30:26,798 --> 00:30:33,158
saying the soil was staying too wet for

722
00:30:30,798 --> 00:30:35,879
too long so you weren't able to get any

723
00:30:33,159 --> 00:30:40,320
gas exchange around the in the root

724
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:42,320
system correct yeah exactly so the

725
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:45,119
structure of the soil being you know

726
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:48,119
really important of course because also

727
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:49,879
how does it compact over time you know

728
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:52,439
how quickly does it Compact and close

729
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:55,880
out that those those pores or how does

730
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:58,880
it retain that that that

731
00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:00,639
paracity and when you say Dy back how

732
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,320
dry are you letting the soil really get

733
00:31:00,638 --> 00:31:04,798
what are we are we talking about bone

734
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:06,720
dry or we talking about just a lower

735
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:11,480
lower moisture level that allows you to

736
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:14,480
re rewater re correct yeah just so what

737
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:17,200
I so I use like our cultivation

738
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:19,440
technicians are using the um the blue

739
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,759
lab pulse moisture meter which I like a

740
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:23,080
lot I think you know it pairs with their

741
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:25,200
phone pretty easily they can go through

742
00:31:23,079 --> 00:31:28,439
and just like stick a lot of pots and

743
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:30,960
and get a a general range um so as long

744
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:33,840
as that's calibrated with the the medium

745
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:36,319
that you're using I look for the plants

746
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:40,638
being around 30% when I want to water

747
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:43,879
again so can the plants get to that 30%

748
00:31:40,638 --> 00:31:46,558
in the time that fits into our schedule

749
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:48,880
to rewater you know so like we we only

750
00:31:46,558 --> 00:31:51,200
actually water our plants two times per

751
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:53,679
week so we water our plants on Mondays

752
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:57,278
and we water our plants on Fridays on

753
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:59,120
Wednesdays is when we apply a a tea and

754
00:31:57,278 --> 00:32:03,359
like I said that usually either just a

755
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:06,839
vermac compost extract or that's the um

756
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:10,599
bubbled granular fertilizer um which

757
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:12,558
like a nutrient tea and so those on on

758
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:14,959
Wednesdays they'll get a liter of tea

759
00:32:12,558 --> 00:32:17,638
which is really pretty small amount of

760
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,840
liquid but on Mondays and Fridays I'd

761
00:32:17,638 --> 00:32:21,599
like that the plants to be able to take

762
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:23,359
a full gallon on both days so if the

763
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:25,158
plants can take that full gallon then

764
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:28,359
I'm getting the dryback that I need so I

765
00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:31,559
want them to reach that 30% or

766
00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:33,759
slightly less but not over before they

767
00:32:31,558 --> 00:32:36,278
get that full gallon again and then as

768
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:38,638
the plants get through flower and

769
00:32:36,278 --> 00:32:42,359
they're they're really metabolizing

770
00:32:38,638 --> 00:32:45,959
really high in like week four through

771
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:47,638
eight let's say then we do an additional

772
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:50,038
moisture reading so we we do the

773
00:32:47,638 --> 00:32:51,959
moisture readings before each watering

774
00:32:50,038 --> 00:32:55,079
so then we do an an additional moisture

775
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:58,480
reading on Wednesdays and the plants

776
00:32:55,079 --> 00:33:00,599
that now are drying back too fast

777
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,120
as they're really metabolizing hard and

778
00:33:00,599 --> 00:33:04,278
building a lot of flow then they'll get

779
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:07,000
a midweek watering but that's usually

780
00:33:04,278 --> 00:33:09,519
very cultivar specific so the majority

781
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:12,038
of the plants are getting watered one

782
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:13,919
gallon on Mondays one gallon on Fridays

783
00:33:12,038 --> 00:33:17,038
but then as we get into that like really

784
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:19,600
heavy bulking phase then plants will get

785
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:21,638
a half gallon sometimes even a gallon

786
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:23,558
depending on the cultivar

787
00:33:21,638 --> 00:33:25,798
midweek but that's usually only for

788
00:33:23,558 --> 00:33:28,200
about three weeks and then we taper that

789
00:33:25,798 --> 00:33:31,000
off again

790
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:33,919
okay okay uh couple thoughts so first

791
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:36,440
off that blue lab pulse meter um I did a

792
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:38,440
full review of it on YouTube channel for

793
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:40,000
people that are listening it's got some

794
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:41,679
really cool features in terms of how it

795
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,278
connects with your phone and allows you

796
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:46,759
to even snap photos or write notes about

797
00:33:45,278 --> 00:33:48,960
in relation to that reading that you're

798
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:51,960
getting uh so you get soil temperature

799
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:54,519
and you get moisture which is cor cool

800
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:56,000
yeah I wish it did I believe I believe

801
00:33:54,519 --> 00:33:58,519
you also get

802
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,759
EC although we don't don't really use

803
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:02,759
that component of it much yes that's

804
00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:04,759
right you do get EC too and I think that

805
00:34:02,759 --> 00:34:06,679
that can be interesting you do need to

806
00:34:04,759 --> 00:34:07,480
correlate it with the moisture level

807
00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:10,079
those

808
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:12,639
are there is a relationship there yeah

809
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:15,839
definitely um but we have found in a

810
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:18,639
couple places that we visited um when I

811
00:34:15,838 --> 00:34:21,960
bring the that in and we go to test the

812
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:24,240
soil we found either uh where we have

813
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:26,079
issues extremely high or extremely low

814
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:29,719
EC and that allows us to figure it out

815
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:29,720
really quickly as a

816
00:34:29,878 --> 00:34:34,319
but sounds like you have a pretty uh you

817
00:34:32,878 --> 00:34:35,878
dialed program for what you guys are

818
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:40,240
doing with consistency to where you

819
00:34:35,878 --> 00:34:42,679
wouldn't see huge swings in EC right um

820
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:45,319
so you're able to use the the pulse

821
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:46,440
meter to measure your your readings and

822
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:48,679
then when

823
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:51,960
you

824
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:54,159
water um you're you're able to water

825
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:56,159
just twice a week and I assume this is

826
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:57,960
because uh the plants are still

827
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:01,559
establishing Roots filling out the

828
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:03,280
container they're not necessarily um

829
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:05,320
needing as much water and then you said

830
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:07,240
you then add because my first thought

831
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:10,200
was like you only water on set days like

832
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:13,239
how do you do that because um in my

833
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:16,519
experience you know plants will need

834
00:35:13,239 --> 00:35:18,519
water you know on it doesn't correlate

835
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:20,759
necessarily with the work week as nicely

836
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:22,800
as we would like it to so right um

837
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:24,640
you're able to do that by adding another

838
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,039
supplementing watering as the roots fill

839
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:28,118
out the pot the plant starts growing

840
00:35:26,039 --> 00:35:30,159
more we further in flower and now you're

841
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:33,039
adding a third watering it sounds like

842
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:37,679
correct um but the other thing is by

843
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:39,759
using the moisture readers we um

844
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:41,519
determine how much water the plants get

845
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:43,680
on Mondays and Fridays so it might not

846
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:45,599
always be the same so if a plant isn't

847
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:47,480
drying back is if one cultivar isn't

848
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:49,079
drying back as fast as another that

849
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:51,119
plant may only get a half gallon on

850
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:53,440
Mondays and a gallon on Friday or

851
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:55,800
something like that so we're using the

852
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:58,039
readings to help guide us into how much

853
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:00,680
water each cultiv our should get at that

854
00:35:58,039 --> 00:36:02,159
watering so I like to get to that gallon

855
00:36:00,679 --> 00:36:04,960
point I feel like when they're getting

856
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:07,078
the gallon twice a week that they're

857
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,880
metabolizing the way that I want them to

858
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:11,560
but it really you know when you have a

859
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:13,680
plant that's six feet tall and a plant a

860
00:36:11,559 --> 00:36:15,719
cultivar that only gets two feet tall

861
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:17,078
and is real bushy or something like that

862
00:36:15,719 --> 00:36:19,598
they're just not going to dry back at

863
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:22,920
the same at the same rate um so the

864
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:25,960
moisture readings guide us as well with

865
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:28,680
how much water they get per watering um

866
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:32,358
and it's not it's not perfect of course

867
00:36:28,679 --> 00:36:35,039
because it's um we're not sampling every

868
00:36:32,358 --> 00:36:36,639
single plant you know so in 744 plants

869
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:39,079
in a room we're not taking a reading off

870
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:41,759
every plant but we're taking enough of a

871
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:44,119
sample size per culti fire to be able to

872
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:46,800
say hey this strain seems like it's

873
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:50,160
drying back slower it's reading every

874
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:52,119
morning at 50 or 60% on Mondays versus

875
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:53,759
the rest reading at 30 we're going to

876
00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:56,160
cut that down to a half a gallon on

877
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:59,640
Mondays things like that so it is it is

878
00:36:56,159 --> 00:37:02,879
adjusted more so than just by the day

879
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:05,679
but by the amount as

880
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:07,160
well and how are you getting that half

881
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:09,000
gallon are you is it a matter of

882
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:11,159
counting when you're using a spray wand

883
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,559
or are you literally pouring out a half

884
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:15,399
gallon into another container and then

885
00:37:12,559 --> 00:37:17,599
water um we're using just like a flow

886
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:19,680
flow meter gallon counter I don't know

887
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:21,200
exactly what you call it but just that

888
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:23,039
little Gadget that you're just hooking

889
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:26,039
on to the end of the hose in between the

890
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:28,159
watering wand and the hose so it's just

891
00:37:26,039 --> 00:37:31,519
measuring the flow that's going past

892
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:33,118
that device yeah it's it's pretty nice

893
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:34,920
it works pretty well I mean they're an

894
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:37,480
inexpensive little piece of equipment

895
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:39,159
and we kind of cycle through quite a few

896
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:41,079
of them because you'll use them for a

897
00:37:39,159 --> 00:37:43,039
couple months or maybe six or eight

898
00:37:41,079 --> 00:37:44,480
months and they won't a technician will

899
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:47,199
say I don't think this one's reading

900
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:49,280
quite the same because I'm they're used

901
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:50,960
to the rhythm of how long a gallon takes

902
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,960
to deliver to the plants and it seems

903
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,838
like it's off then we replace them I

904
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,720
mean but they're they're it's I'd say

905
00:37:54,838 --> 00:37:59,239
they're pretty effective overall so yeah

906
00:37:56,719 --> 00:38:01,078
all the technicians just use a hose

907
00:37:59,239 --> 00:38:05,000
watering wand with the gallon counter on

908
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:07,440
it and we determine how many gallons or

909
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:10,358
half gallon 3/4 of a gallon whatever we

910
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:13,960
want to give them and then they're just

911
00:38:10,358 --> 00:38:18,000
watching the meter and going to the next

912
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:19,880
Plant and what uh talking since we're

913
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,159
talking about water uh what is your

914
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:27,160
water source so the facility was built

915
00:38:23,159 --> 00:38:29,159
out with RO water um as we're expanding

916
00:38:27,159 --> 00:38:31,078
into another facility I think we're

917
00:38:29,159 --> 00:38:34,078
going to move to to city water that's

918
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:36,000
filtered versus using reverse osmosis in

919
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:38,920
the new facility I think it's a bit of

920
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,358
Overkill and it also is pretty wasteful

921
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:44,760
and it doesn't really align with the

922
00:38:40,358 --> 00:38:47,759
company's Mission um but it works fine I

923
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:51,760
mean I've always I think there's a lot

924
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:55,119
of um discussion over whether reverse

925
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:58,960
osmosis water can negatively impact good

926
00:38:55,119 --> 00:39:01,720
soil and soil microbial life and I think

927
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,920
that um it's hard to say it's something

928
00:39:01,719 --> 00:39:07,039
that I thought quite a lot of bit uh

929
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:10,039
quite um a lot about over the past few

930
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:11,880
years or five or six years is would it

931
00:39:10,039 --> 00:39:16,358
be better to not be using reverse

932
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:18,880
osmosis water um but since our plants

933
00:39:16,358 --> 00:39:20,759
don't run off at all I feel like the

934
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:23,880
fact that if it is like over

935
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:27,440
solubilizing nutrients um in its like

936
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:30,680
corrosiveness essentially and washing

937
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:32,720
some nutrients out of the soil they're

938
00:39:30,679 --> 00:39:34,118
able to kind of go back in because

939
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:36,159
they're in a saucer and so it's all

940
00:39:34,119 --> 00:39:39,119
contained if we were running the waste

941
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:40,759
if we were running you know like a lot

942
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:42,280
of water out the bottom of the pots I

943
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:44,880
think it would probably flush nutrients

944
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:47,160
too quickly um but that's not the case

945
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:50,880
we're with our system so it works pretty

946
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:52,960
well and then considering that we do add

947
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:55,000
you know we do use it with our te's at

948
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:57,119
least we kind of know where it's at and

949
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,679
we know what we're adding and and we

950
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:01,838
know that we're not getting any like

951
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:05,039
antagonism from maybe the calcium and

952
00:40:01,838 --> 00:40:05,039
magnesium that's in the tap

953
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:17,719
water and what um what are you running

954
00:40:09,559 --> 00:40:20,480
for ppfd at canopy so I run up to around

955
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:26,318
500 I I'm sorry I start off at around

956
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:30,559
400 to 500 in veg finish around 700 ppfd

957
00:40:26,318 --> 00:40:33,358
in veg and then run from 700 and top out

958
00:40:30,559 --> 00:40:36,159
around a Max of 1100 in flower so I'm

959
00:40:33,358 --> 00:40:37,838
usually hitting right around 1050 and I

960
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:39,679
find like that's kind of the sweet spot

961
00:40:37,838 --> 00:40:43,318
for me so like the lights that we're

962
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:46,759
using at 144 um fluent spiders in each

963
00:40:43,318 --> 00:40:48,719
room which um they're reaching the end

964
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:50,280
of their life here so I am experimenting

965
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:52,399
with some other fixtures to see if

966
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:56,440
there's you know an an advantage to

967
00:40:52,400 --> 00:41:00,000
trying something new but um right around

968
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:04,318
1050 seems to be where I don't start to

969
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,880
see light burn or you know plant stress

970
00:41:04,318 --> 00:41:07,599
once I get above that which I have

971
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,838
experimented higher than that I just

972
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:11,280
haven't really

973
00:41:08,838 --> 00:41:13,119
seen a benefit like I know a lot of

974
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,560
people run substantially higher than

975
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:16,599
that and say that you're going to get

976
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:19,358
higher yield but I usually just see too

977
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:21,039
much plant stress above that that it

978
00:41:19,358 --> 00:41:22,838
just doesn't equate to higher yield now

979
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:25,358
I know you have to obviously feed in

980
00:41:22,838 --> 00:41:28,039
higher and you know the plants have to

981
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:30,000
metabolize higher so you need more CO2

982
00:41:28,039 --> 00:41:33,039
at higher temperature all those things

983
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,318
which is sort of hard to push in soil

984
00:41:33,039 --> 00:41:37,279
from my experience um it's not like

985
00:41:35,318 --> 00:41:40,880
Hydroponics obviously where you're just

986
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:43,119
dialing in a certain feed level so for

987
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:45,880
me I think we're pushing the plants kind

988
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:48,119
of as hard as we can nutrient wise and

989
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:50,280
that seems to be the right point to get

990
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:52,240
us the yields and the quality which are

991
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:55,200
always a balance of course I know a lot

992
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:58,679
of people push really high yields but

993
00:41:55,199 --> 00:42:00,919
those people when I see their systems I

994
00:41:58,679 --> 00:42:03,598
feel like often times at it's at the

995
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:05,119
expense of quality and so that's always

996
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:07,599
you're always trying to find this sweet

997
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:09,760
spot of quality and yield and that

998
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:12,200
usually hits it for me around

999
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:15,880
there and what are the CO2 levels that

1000
00:42:12,199 --> 00:42:19,799
you're running in the rooms so in veg I

1001
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:22,960
run around 800 ppms and then in flow I

1002
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:26,359
go from that 800 ppms up to about 1,400

1003
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:30,159
ppms and it's just adjusting up by the

1004
00:42:26,358 --> 00:42:32,679
week I've tried some rooms of dropping

1005
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:35,399
the CO2 levels down in the last two

1006
00:42:32,679 --> 00:42:37,759
weeks I I still think it's sort of

1007
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:41,079
questionable whether or not it's just a

1008
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:42,839
waste of CO2 toward the end um if the

1009
00:42:41,079 --> 00:42:44,640
plants are really using it when you

1010
00:42:42,838 --> 00:42:47,199
start to drop temperature and you start

1011
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:49,279
to hold back on water and the plant

1012
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:51,598
metabolism starts slowing down is it

1013
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:54,040
really necessary to run that high to the

1014
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:56,519
exact finish and I think there's been a

1015
00:42:54,039 --> 00:42:58,880
lot of discussion about that and maybe

1016
00:42:56,519 --> 00:43:01,519
disagreement about that so I do usually

1017
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:04,079
step down CO2 in the last two weeks but

1018
00:43:01,519 --> 00:43:06,519
not back down to like 600 like some

1019
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:10,160
people do so I'll usually finish around

1020
00:43:06,519 --> 00:43:12,920
a thousand ppms CO2 in a room that's

1021
00:43:10,159 --> 00:43:16,118
pretty 1400 High I I mean in my

1022
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:18,000
experience um and I would I would

1023
00:43:16,119 --> 00:43:19,760
speculate I mean I don't think there's a

1024
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,318
ton of research on this that at least

1025
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:25,440
that I've seen that uh stepping it down

1026
00:43:23,318 --> 00:43:27,838
in the final weeks is that would be

1027
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:29,519
beneficial yeah that you're just not

1028
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:31,960
utilizing it with the amount of light

1029
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:32,800
and you know metabolism that's happening

1030
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:34,760
in the

1031
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:37,760
plant exactly towards the very end of

1032
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:39,280
its life cycle assuming you have a plant

1033
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,680
that's going to that wants to finish

1034
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:43,359
around the time that you're harvesting

1035
00:43:40,679 --> 00:43:47,159
because I know in commercial facilities

1036
00:43:43,358 --> 00:43:49,679
you don't have the luxury of you know

1037
00:43:47,159 --> 00:43:52,920
running a plant an extra two three weeks

1038
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:54,919
to hit maybe optimal uh cannaboid or

1039
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:58,200
tpine levels um just because you're on a

1040
00:43:54,920 --> 00:44:00,480
schedule definitely I'd say that you

1041
00:43:58,199 --> 00:44:02,439
know CO2 is kind of an elusive one

1042
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:04,519
because it's it's really hard and just

1043
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:08,318
like with any R&amp;D it's hard

1044
00:44:04,519 --> 00:44:10,119
to isolate one control especially in a

1045
00:44:08,318 --> 00:44:12,759
big room like when we're in a room

1046
00:44:10,119 --> 00:44:16,519
that's half of our total production area

1047
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:19,480
if I was to drop it to you know 600 ppms

1048
00:44:16,519 --> 00:44:21,639
in the last two weeks and I saw 10%

1049
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:23,800
reduction in yield that would be a big

1050
00:44:21,639 --> 00:44:25,358
problem you know so it's it's really

1051
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:28,000
difficult again to experiment in these

1052
00:44:25,358 --> 00:44:30,400
large flower rooms um but it's also

1053
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,519
there's just so many variables of course

1054
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:35,358
every cycle um so I haven't really

1055
00:44:32,519 --> 00:44:39,039
experimented a whole lot with CO2 what I

1056
00:44:35,358 --> 00:44:41,440
have changed more over my years of in

1057
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:43,159
this same system of production is

1058
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:45,440
humidity I would say that's probably the

1059
00:44:43,159 --> 00:44:48,199
biggest thing that's changed from where

1060
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:50,760
I started and as to where I am right now

1061
00:44:48,199 --> 00:44:53,078
um temperature I've always ran a similar

1062
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:55,240
temperature in the room so like in the

1063
00:44:53,079 --> 00:44:59,599
peak metabolism phase of flower I'm

1064
00:44:55,239 --> 00:45:01,239
running like around 80 deges and I do

1065
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:03,000
definitely drop that down pretty

1066
00:45:01,239 --> 00:45:04,919
substantially in the last two weeks to

1067
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,239
get like the color and the finish and

1068
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:09,639
the the tarpine profile that we're

1069
00:45:07,239 --> 00:45:11,118
looking for and I think that cooling it

1070
00:45:09,639 --> 00:45:13,159
down and just sort of preserving the

1071
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:17,119
Tarpin at the at the end and not cooking

1072
00:45:13,159 --> 00:45:19,000
things off is pretty important um and I

1073
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:20,760
have played around more with the

1074
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,800
differential between day and night

1075
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:25,520
temperature in the beginning I was only

1076
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:28,240
running at a five degree differential

1077
00:45:25,519 --> 00:45:31,318
and I've pushed that much farther apart

1078
00:45:28,239 --> 00:45:33,279
now and I have seen again it's hard to

1079
00:45:31,318 --> 00:45:34,639
attribute it to just one specific thing

1080
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:37,280
because you're making a lot of changes

1081
00:45:34,639 --> 00:45:39,920
each each cycle sometimes in especially

1082
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:41,960
in cultivar you know like we run eight

1083
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:44,000
to 12 cultivars a cycle and they're

1084
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:47,000
always different you know so it's it's

1085
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:49,119
hard to really truly say but I feel as

1086
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:52,239
though bringing that differential

1087
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:54,240
farther apart and trying even to achieve

1088
00:45:52,239 --> 00:45:56,439
definitely a 10 degree spread but even

1089
00:45:54,239 --> 00:46:00,479
up to a 15 degree spread in the last two

1090
00:45:56,440 --> 00:46:02,599
weeks can really push yield and quality

1091
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:04,519
i' I feel as though I've seen that quite

1092
00:46:02,599 --> 00:46:06,440
a bit and I've definitely read some

1093
00:46:04,519 --> 00:46:07,880
studies and I try and dig into research

1094
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:09,280
all the time because it's it's so

1095
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:11,519
exciting obviously now all the new

1096
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:13,599
research that's coming out and I've seen

1097
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:15,838
some reearch research that suggested

1098
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:18,960
that a 70 degree night temperature and

1099
00:46:15,838 --> 00:46:21,558
an 81 degree day temperature was optimal

1100
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:24,639
for yield on certain cannabis strains

1101
00:46:21,559 --> 00:46:26,960
and I feel pretty similar to that spread

1102
00:46:24,639 --> 00:46:29,519
being probably the most effective of the

1103
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:31,559
different ones that I've tried but as

1104
00:46:29,519 --> 00:46:35,239
far as humidity that's something that

1105
00:46:31,559 --> 00:46:38,359
I've really raised over my time in

1106
00:46:35,239 --> 00:46:41,318
production here and I think that was it

1107
00:46:38,358 --> 00:46:44,279
was primarily fear driven at first to be

1108
00:46:41,318 --> 00:46:47,159
honest is like running a room at 72%

1109
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:49,480
humidity and flour just went against

1110
00:46:47,159 --> 00:46:53,679
everything that I knew about managing

1111
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:55,519
disease in in cannabis and so I was very

1112
00:46:53,679 --> 00:46:58,919
nervous to ever run those higher

1113
00:46:55,519 --> 00:47:01,079
humidities and now I run that 72 to 74%

1114
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:03,599
humidity definitely through the veg

1115
00:47:01,079 --> 00:47:06,800
cycle into week one and two and then

1116
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:10,760
when I step it down I step it down much

1117
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:15,039
more gradually and I'm really running in

1118
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:17,559
the 68 to 70% humidity range through

1119
00:47:15,039 --> 00:47:21,000
week three to four and only really

1120
00:47:17,559 --> 00:47:22,839
stepping it down into like the 50s and

1121
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:26,960
potentially Below in the very last few

1122
00:47:22,838 --> 00:47:30,318
weeks of flow and I have not seen any

1123
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:33,240
more problems with plant disease at

1124
00:47:30,318 --> 00:47:37,318
those higher humidities honestly I feel

1125
00:47:33,239 --> 00:47:39,318
like running that 70% humidity through

1126
00:47:37,318 --> 00:47:42,400
well through the first half of flour has

1127
00:47:39,318 --> 00:47:46,679
actually been beneficial in preventing

1128
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:48,880
powder Milo um I I really I feel like

1129
00:47:46,679 --> 00:47:50,719
I've I've definitely clearly seen you

1130
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:52,960
know I've dealt with powdery mildew

1131
00:47:50,719 --> 00:47:56,118
we've had a few instances primarily it

1132
00:47:52,960 --> 00:48:00,760
comes from you know genetics bringing in

1133
00:47:56,119 --> 00:48:04,079
New strains and things like that um but

1134
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:06,000
when I have had issues it's usually been

1135
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:08,720
when there was a problem with the

1136
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:11,800
management of the HVAC system so that

1137
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:13,358
there was bigger swings in the humidity

1138
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:15,599
and now that I've been able to tighten

1139
00:48:13,358 --> 00:48:19,679
that band up which I really attribute to

1140
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:21,318
blae dykman who is my um is an HVAC

1141
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:24,039
specialist that I brought in two and a

1142
00:48:21,318 --> 00:48:26,239
half years ago he's really changed some

1143
00:48:24,039 --> 00:48:27,838
things about how we run the air

1144
00:48:26,239 --> 00:48:30,519
conditioners and the dehumidifiers and

1145
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:33,039
we really run the ve the dehumidifiers

1146
00:48:30,519 --> 00:48:35,639
very little now so he's using like the

1147
00:48:33,039 --> 00:48:38,639
reheat component of the air conditioning

1148
00:48:35,639 --> 00:48:40,519
to heat the air on the supply side so

1149
00:48:38,639 --> 00:48:42,960
that we're doing most of the

1150
00:48:40,519 --> 00:48:45,679
dehumidification with the air handlers

1151
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:47,880
versus the dehumidifiers and the

1152
00:48:45,679 --> 00:48:51,960
difference in that band in tightening up

1153
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:54,920
that band has just been so beneficial to

1154
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:58,960
the plant disease Cycles um I'm able to

1155
00:48:54,920 --> 00:49:00,159
maintain like a like a 5% humidity band

1156
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:02,240
whereas when we were using the

1157
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:05,719
dehumidifiers there's 18 dehumidifiers

1158
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:09,000
in each room the band would swing

1159
00:49:05,719 --> 00:49:11,759
sometimes 20% from Peak humidity to low

1160
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:14,440
humidity over and over again every hour

1161
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:16,040
and I feel like that was a big driver of

1162
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:18,519
um disease

1163
00:49:16,039 --> 00:49:22,239
spread absolutely yeah I think you're

1164
00:49:18,519 --> 00:49:23,559
right on spot on with that and um

1165
00:49:22,239 --> 00:49:25,838
getting back

1166
00:49:23,559 --> 00:49:27,240
to this idea you mentioned you have to

1167
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:29,480
bring you're bringing a new C cultivars

1168
00:49:27,239 --> 00:49:30,759
all the time um every room is you know

1169
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:31,920
you're changing so many dials it's

1170
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:33,160
really hard to know exactly what's

1171
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,880
making a difference I think that's a

1172
00:49:33,159 --> 00:49:38,279
really important thing to highlight

1173
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:40,000
because we are you know if we want to do

1174
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:42,798
a controlled experiment it really does

1175
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:45,159
need to be um across a few different

1176
00:49:42,798 --> 00:49:47,358
cultivars so we can get an idea of the

1177
00:49:45,159 --> 00:49:49,719
genetic diversity that's in cannabis and

1178
00:49:47,358 --> 00:49:52,440
how it responds to a given you know

1179
00:49:49,719 --> 00:49:55,399
mechanism or change uh and that's where

1180
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:57,358
this uh getting back to this R&amp;D room

1181
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:59,760
that you mentioned you wish you had uh

1182
00:49:57,358 --> 00:50:01,000
right again like every time we consult

1183
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:03,359
with someone that's the first thing I

1184
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,679
look for on their design is to make sure

1185
00:50:03,358 --> 00:50:06,798
they have that because it's not only an

1186
00:50:04,679 --> 00:50:09,879
R&amp;D room but it's also a quarantine

1187
00:50:06,798 --> 00:50:12,079
space so when you bring in new genetics

1188
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:13,519
you need to be testing those genetics to

1189
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:14,480
make sure they're clean and you need to

1190
00:50:13,519 --> 00:50:16,239
grow them out to make sure that they

1191
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:19,798
don't have pests because some things

1192
00:50:16,239 --> 00:50:23,039
will pupate in the leaves or in the soil

1193
00:50:19,798 --> 00:50:24,798
and we need to wait give them time to

1194
00:50:23,039 --> 00:50:27,519
really uh make sure that they're clean

1195
00:50:24,798 --> 00:50:29,679
so definitely I want to highlight that a

1196
00:50:27,519 --> 00:50:31,880
question you brought up a ton of really

1197
00:50:29,679 --> 00:50:36,399
great stuff there uh a question I had

1198
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:39,440
though going back was all the way to um

1199
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:41,720
CO2 I was wondering how do you disperse

1200
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:44,119
that evenly across the room being that

1201
00:50:41,719 --> 00:50:45,798
CO2 is heavier than air what's your

1202
00:50:44,119 --> 00:50:48,240
method for making sure that this you

1203
00:50:45,798 --> 00:50:51,079
know massive vertical difference that

1204
00:50:48,239 --> 00:50:54,078
you have across canopies uh stays as

1205
00:50:51,079 --> 00:50:56,839
relatively even as you can yeah it's

1206
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:59,200
definitely very difficult um the way so

1207
00:50:56,838 --> 00:51:02,078
the CO2 injects into one of the duck

1208
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:03,838
socks on one of the air handlers so

1209
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:06,039
essentially the air handler is then just

1210
00:51:03,838 --> 00:51:07,599
moving it through the room that's not

1211
00:51:06,039 --> 00:51:10,358
going to be perfect because they're not

1212
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:13,039
always running when the CO2 would inject

1213
00:51:10,358 --> 00:51:15,400
so it definitely isn't perfectly

1214
00:51:13,039 --> 00:51:17,798
homogenized um but we have a lot of

1215
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:20,358
horizontal fans in the room that are

1216
00:51:17,798 --> 00:51:23,599
moving in kind of a a serpentine design

1217
00:51:20,358 --> 00:51:26,798
so we have a serpentine design on each

1218
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:28,359
um tier where you know one row is

1219
00:51:26,798 --> 00:51:30,480
blowing one way and then the next row is

1220
00:51:28,358 --> 00:51:33,639
blowing the opposite way for each of the

1221
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:37,039
four rows and that is replicated on the

1222
00:51:33,639 --> 00:51:39,400
second and third tier and I think just

1223
00:51:37,039 --> 00:51:41,279
having that high volume of vertical air

1224
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:43,480
movement plus there's some vertical fans

1225
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:46,319
in the rooms as well and just keeping

1226
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:48,639
that air stirred really well is just our

1227
00:51:46,318 --> 00:51:50,000
best strategy for homogenizing all of

1228
00:51:48,639 --> 00:51:53,078
the air

1229
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,880
inevitably the air flow and the the

1230
00:51:53,079 --> 00:51:56,318
climate are not the same I have sensors

1231
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:58,680
on the third tier I have sensors on the

1232
00:51:56,318 --> 00:52:00,558
first first here you know so we so we we

1233
00:51:58,679 --> 00:52:04,118
had the Argus control system which gives

1234
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:05,920
us a lot of data of course over the

1235
00:52:04,119 --> 00:52:08,440
environmental set points in the room and

1236
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:10,240
that's extremely helpful um but also

1237
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:13,318
I've installed just some smaller like

1238
00:52:10,239 --> 00:52:15,000
cheap sensors to be able to see what's

1239
00:52:13,318 --> 00:52:16,798
happening on the third deer third tier

1240
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:19,559
compared to the ground floors and the

1241
00:52:16,798 --> 00:52:21,119
third tier definitely has more swings

1242
00:52:19,559 --> 00:52:22,519
because the air handlers are all up

1243
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:24,160
there you know so it's substantially

1244
00:52:22,519 --> 00:52:26,119
cooler when the air when the air

1245
00:52:24,159 --> 00:52:28,480
conditioning is running it can heat up

1246
00:52:26,119 --> 00:52:31,280
quite a bit bit as the heat in the room

1247
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:32,798
Rises um so I see bigger swings up there

1248
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:35,480
and what I've done over the years is

1249
00:52:32,798 --> 00:52:38,440
generally I just plant the shorter

1250
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:41,760
cultivars on the third tier um the ones

1251
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:45,240
that have kind of a more compact canopy

1252
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:47,520
my theory with that is just that these

1253
00:52:45,239 --> 00:52:50,078
shorter stocky stockier plants that have

1254
00:52:47,519 --> 00:52:52,880
this more compact canopy are able to

1255
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:56,079
hold kind of a boundary of humidity

1256
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:57,798
within their own canopy so that like

1257
00:52:56,079 --> 00:53:00,839
sort of boundary layer that those

1258
00:52:57,798 --> 00:53:03,119
shorter plants create themselves is a

1259
00:53:00,838 --> 00:53:05,159
bit more of a buffer and then I mean

1260
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:07,559
it's just a workflow management thing

1261
00:53:05,159 --> 00:53:10,679
too I mean having if you have a plant

1262
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:12,599
that has a a ton of stretch and you're

1263
00:53:10,679 --> 00:53:17,199
trellis training it and doing all this

1264
00:53:12,599 --> 00:53:18,720
work to harvest it and de dellis it um

1265
00:53:17,199 --> 00:53:20,719
it's much easier for that to be on the

1266
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:22,078
ground floor because you can just pay

1267
00:53:20,719 --> 00:53:24,318
more attention to it without having to

1268
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:27,640
get up on a scissor lift so those

1269
00:53:24,318 --> 00:53:29,079
compact more compact plants

1270
00:53:27,639 --> 00:53:31,440
just work better from a labor

1271
00:53:29,079 --> 00:53:33,920
perspective as well on the third tier

1272
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:36,480
another thing that I've started doing

1273
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:39,240
maybe two years ago was using air movers

1274
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:41,599
on the floor so just like a basic big

1275
00:53:39,239 --> 00:53:44,439
air mover fan that you plug in that can

1276
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:48,000
really blow a lot of air down the floor

1277
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:50,480
we put those at the ends of the aisles

1278
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:53,719
on each side of the room because what we

1279
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:56,960
noticed um specifically was the back

1280
00:53:53,719 --> 00:53:59,399
corners of the room on the ground tier

1281
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:01,519
had a lot of problems with pests or

1282
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:03,119
disease and it was just an air flow

1283
00:54:01,519 --> 00:54:04,798
issue you know it was just like creating

1284
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:07,119
kind of a pocket back there where there

1285
00:54:04,798 --> 00:54:08,679
wasn't much air movement and heat would

1286
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:11,559
kind of build up in those back corners

1287
00:54:08,679 --> 00:54:13,960
and we would see things like thrips um

1288
00:54:11,559 --> 00:54:16,000
kind of setting in in those back corners

1289
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:18,880
of the rooms because there just wasn't

1290
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:20,519
any good air flow and so now we put an

1291
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:22,480
air mover in those back corners and

1292
00:54:20,519 --> 00:54:24,440
we're always like blowing air out of

1293
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:26,440
that back corner of the room and that

1294
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:28,200
helps to just kind of keep that air St

1295
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:29,720
ring on the floor as well and that

1296
00:54:28,199 --> 00:54:31,719
probably helps with your CO2 because

1297
00:54:29,719 --> 00:54:33,519
your CO2 is going to come settle and as

1298
00:54:31,719 --> 00:54:36,279
long as you have this air movement not

1299
00:54:33,519 --> 00:54:38,559
just above the canopy but on the floor

1300
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:41,119
you're moving air off of the floor and

1301
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:43,079
kind of redistributing it back into the

1302
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:45,358
into the

1303
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:47,480
mix yeah that was another question I was

1304
00:54:45,358 --> 00:54:49,558
going to ask you was do you typically

1305
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:52,719
see most of your pathogen and pest

1306
00:54:49,559 --> 00:54:55,119
issues and plant stress stuff at on the

1307
00:54:52,719 --> 00:54:56,879
top canopy because it does have more

1308
00:54:55,119 --> 00:55:00,280
fluctuation um

1309
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:02,480
board would as a pattern I would say at

1310
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:04,440
first so like the the first year that we

1311
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:06,760
were in production we only ran on two

1312
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:08,639
tiers and then the second year we moved

1313
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:12,400
into the third tier and it definitely

1314
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:16,480
took some time to figure out how best to

1315
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:19,400
manage the climate there and it also I

1316
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:21,880
mean there's just like it's it's

1317
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:24,720
multiple things because it's not just

1318
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:27,400
the climate but it's just the individual

1319
00:55:24,719 --> 00:55:29,038
workers often can spend less time on the

1320
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:30,838
third tier they just there's less eyes

1321
00:55:29,039 --> 00:55:32,799
up there you may not be catching

1322
00:55:30,838 --> 00:55:34,679
something as quickly and we have quite a

1323
00:55:32,798 --> 00:55:36,000
good scouting program so that we're

1324
00:55:34,679 --> 00:55:37,798
making sure that we're looking at all

1325
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:40,480
the plants every day and that sort of

1326
00:55:37,798 --> 00:55:43,759
thing um from a kind of a bird's eye

1327
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:45,480
view as well but it's it's still

1328
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:48,400
difficult to get the the same amount of

1329
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:50,000
attention to the higher tiers like

1330
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:52,358
everything is just more difficult like I

1331
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:54,000
say things take twice as long on the

1332
00:55:52,358 --> 00:55:55,759
second tier but they take four times as

1333
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,400
long on the third tier and that's just

1334
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,880
as simple as harvesting the plants on

1335
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:00,358
the ground floor you're just cutting

1336
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:02,400
them down you're carrying them over

1337
00:56:00,358 --> 00:56:04,400
you're weighing them on the second tier

1338
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:06,358
you're you're handing them down and then

1339
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:07,760
on the third tier you're binning them

1340
00:56:06,358 --> 00:56:09,598
and running them like we actually run

1341
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:11,240
them down like a pulley sort of thing to

1342
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:12,680
drop them down in a bin to the people on

1343
00:56:11,239 --> 00:56:14,598
the ground and you're running that

1344
00:56:12,679 --> 00:56:18,000
pulley back up so everything on the

1345
00:56:14,599 --> 00:56:20,559
third tier takes longer and um it's just

1346
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:22,039
more challenging but then the the the

1347
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:24,640
benefit of the third tier is it also

1348
00:56:22,039 --> 00:56:25,680
doesn't have a top so the the second the

1349
00:56:24,639 --> 00:56:27,639
first and the second tier have

1350
00:56:25,679 --> 00:56:29,919
essentially a roof which is the bench of

1351
00:56:27,639 --> 00:56:32,558
the tier above them but the third tier

1352
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:34,280
is just open and I did play around a

1353
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:37,280
little bit with that because I was

1354
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:38,680
concerned about the air air conditioners

1355
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:40,680
being up there which occasionally you

1356
00:56:38,679 --> 00:56:44,078
know you have something that's leaking

1357
00:56:40,679 --> 00:56:46,279
or a pipe that's cloged or just a

1358
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:48,318
machine that freezes like the dehes used

1359
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:50,720
to freeze a lot when we use the

1360
00:56:48,318 --> 00:56:52,759
dehumidifiers and then they're leaking

1361
00:56:50,719 --> 00:56:54,399
water on the plant so we did experiment

1362
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:57,760
with like putting like a plexiglass

1363
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:59,559
ceiling on the third floor but then as

1364
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:01,799
we were able to better manage the

1365
00:56:59,559 --> 00:57:05,119
equipment and and dial that in more on a

1366
00:57:01,798 --> 00:57:07,480
control system side and I think the big

1367
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:09,079
benefit of getting a person working in

1368
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:10,880
the building on a daily basis that's

1369
00:57:09,079 --> 00:57:12,760
like an HVAC specialist and is really

1370
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:17,079
able to like do the preventative

1371
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:18,760
maintenance in a more complete way um as

1372
00:57:17,079 --> 00:57:22,200
we had less and less problems with the

1373
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:25,839
machines then I I decided just to remove

1374
00:57:22,199 --> 00:57:27,919
that third tier roof essentially because

1375
00:57:25,838 --> 00:57:29,798
there is so much air that gets stirred

1376
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:32,480
up there just from the air handlers

1377
00:57:29,798 --> 00:57:35,000
running all the time so I found actually

1378
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:37,679
that due to the increased air flow up

1379
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:40,159
there even though there's a bigger swing

1380
00:57:37,679 --> 00:57:43,038
in humidity and temperature you have

1381
00:57:40,159 --> 00:57:45,558
substantially more air moving on the top

1382
00:57:43,039 --> 00:57:47,359
and that it probably offsets a lot of

1383
00:57:45,559 --> 00:57:49,200
the disease pressure that you would get

1384
00:57:47,358 --> 00:57:50,519
from those swings just with that amount

1385
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:52,318
of air like when you're up there you

1386
00:57:50,519 --> 00:57:54,119
just I mean it's just like blasting you

1387
00:57:52,318 --> 00:57:55,838
when the air conditioners are on and you

1388
00:57:54,119 --> 00:57:59,119
can see the plants even on the camera

1389
00:57:55,838 --> 00:58:00,558
just really waving really hard in the

1390
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:03,358
third on the third tier when all that

1391
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:04,519
air flow is up there yeah I think it

1392
00:58:03,358 --> 00:58:07,558
kind of

1393
00:58:04,519 --> 00:58:11,000
balances moving uh the plants up and

1394
00:58:07,559 --> 00:58:12,880
down you talked about dust management um

1395
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:15,000
are you seeing more issues with

1396
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:18,519
microbials and stuff or things you know

1397
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:21,358
from the soil ending up on the buds as

1398
00:58:18,519 --> 00:58:25,400
you go to the lower levels from that top

1399
00:58:21,358 --> 00:58:27,480
level not not so much I mean we during

1400
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:29,039
the transplant planning there's

1401
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:31,000
definitely an amount of soil that gets

1402
00:58:29,039 --> 00:58:32,960
stirred up and we see that just on like

1403
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,358
the filters on the HVAC equipment you

1404
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:35,960
know usually we wait until we do the

1405
00:58:34,358 --> 00:58:37,838
transplant then we change all the

1406
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:38,720
filters because just from that one day

1407
00:58:37,838 --> 00:58:40,838
of

1408
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:42,838
transplanting there's so much dust

1409
00:58:40,838 --> 00:58:45,358
that's created that the filters just get

1410
00:58:42,838 --> 00:58:47,480
dirty from one day like that but then

1411
00:58:45,358 --> 00:58:49,119
once the plants are in place and they're

1412
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:51,400
starting to get watered in we don't

1413
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:54,240
really see much more problems as far as

1414
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:56,318
dust management we do after the plants

1415
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:58,439
are in place for a week or two do a full

1416
00:58:56,318 --> 00:59:00,159
cleaning of the benches with the plants

1417
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:01,720
in place so we can eliminate all that

1418
00:59:00,159 --> 00:59:03,838
dust and that can include wiping down

1419
00:59:01,719 --> 00:59:06,159
the lights and the crossbars and

1420
00:59:03,838 --> 00:59:09,318
everything and I like to do that early

1421
00:59:06,159 --> 00:59:11,159
in flour so that you're not moving

1422
00:59:09,318 --> 00:59:13,440
microbes around once the flow is

1423
00:59:11,159 --> 00:59:15,399
developed but once that initial cleaning

1424
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:17,400
is done which you know we like to have

1425
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:19,240
that occur by the third week of flower

1426
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:22,680
then we haven't really seen too many

1427
00:59:19,239 --> 00:59:25,000
problems with dust or microbes coming

1428
00:59:22,679 --> 00:59:27,838
from the soil I don't use any sort of

1429
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:29,599
mulch I'm not a big fan of mulch because

1430
00:59:27,838 --> 00:59:32,318
I like indoors because I I mean I Love

1431
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:35,680
It Outdoors but indoors um I think it

1432
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:39,119
can host problems you know like fungus

1433
00:59:35,679 --> 00:59:41,679
Nets and different things and I like to

1434
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:43,880
be able to see that dry back and have

1435
00:59:41,679 --> 00:59:45,558
that top layer of the soil dry out

1436
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:47,720
enough so again that we can control

1437
00:59:45,559 --> 00:59:50,839
things like fungus Nets plus we also do

1438
00:59:47,719 --> 00:59:53,919
the top dress and we do applications of

1439
00:59:50,838 --> 00:59:56,599
like strul lip schmidtis that Predator

1440
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:58,920
might in the soil to combat things like

1441
00:59:56,599 --> 01:00:01,318
thrips and fungus Nets so I like to have

1442
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:04,000
the top layer of the soil unmulched but

1443
01:00:01,318 --> 01:00:06,000
it does become challenging like when you

1444
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:08,798
harvest the plants especially if they're

1445
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:10,318
really Long Tall cultivars you know

1446
01:00:08,798 --> 01:00:12,159
trying to cut down the plants and making

1447
01:00:10,318 --> 01:00:15,279
sure none of the flower drags into the

1448
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:17,199
soil but what we do and I mean and again

1449
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:18,960
I think we have the luxury of being able

1450
01:00:17,199 --> 01:00:21,439
to pay a lot of attention to these

1451
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:24,519
plants individually because we are a

1452
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:27,400
smaller grow is we anytime a bud touches

1453
01:00:24,519 --> 01:00:29,960
the soil that goes into a fresh frozen

1454
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:33,000
batch and doesn't get sold as flour so

1455
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:34,679
we just eliminate the risk by if we know

1456
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:37,239
bud is touching soil it just it just

1457
01:00:34,679 --> 01:00:39,038
doesn't get tested for a pan you're

1458
01:00:37,239 --> 01:00:40,558
doing some foler applications too that I

1459
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:41,799
assume would sort of rinse the plants a

1460
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:44,240
little bit too of any dust that might

1461
01:00:41,798 --> 01:00:47,079
have got on them at

1462
01:00:44,239 --> 01:00:49,358
transplant yeah so foler applications

1463
01:00:47,079 --> 01:00:52,400
are interesting because

1464
01:00:49,358 --> 01:00:55,440
um outdoor farming for vegetables I did

1465
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:59,680
a lot of foler feeds foler microbial

1466
01:00:55,440 --> 01:01:02,119
products for disease prevention and um

1467
01:00:59,679 --> 01:01:04,199
of course you're dealing with rain

1468
01:01:02,119 --> 01:01:08,760
washing those Products off and I think a

1469
01:01:04,199 --> 01:01:11,480
lot of the product mix rates are

1470
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:13,680
designed sort of for outdoor agriculture

1471
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:17,079
so they

1472
01:01:13,679 --> 01:01:19,358
may I I I don't know you know how people

1473
01:01:17,079 --> 01:01:21,000
are just are making the mix rates that

1474
01:01:19,358 --> 01:01:23,358
work for these companies pesticide

1475
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:25,559
companies but my suspicion is that that

1476
01:01:23,358 --> 01:01:27,519
that's taken into account how long that

1477
01:01:25,559 --> 01:01:29,480
product will actually stay on the leaves

1478
01:01:27,519 --> 01:01:32,119
until it'll need to be reapplied and

1479
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:34,519
that rain do things like that are a

1480
01:01:32,119 --> 01:01:36,798
factor in how long it persist in the on

1481
01:01:34,519 --> 01:01:38,639
the plant um indoors of course when you

1482
01:01:36,798 --> 01:01:40,239
spray something on a plant it's going to

1483
01:01:38,639 --> 01:01:42,440
stay there you know you're not going to

1484
01:01:40,239 --> 01:01:46,199
wash it off there's no rain um there's

1485
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:47,679
no do so you do have to be careful with

1486
01:01:46,199 --> 01:01:50,719
what you're spraying on the plants

1487
01:01:47,679 --> 01:01:52,598
particularly in flower um because that

1488
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:54,679
might persist a lot longer and I did

1489
01:01:52,599 --> 01:01:58,160
learn a little bit the hard way with one

1490
01:01:54,679 --> 01:01:59,838
particular product when um I tank mixed

1491
01:01:58,159 --> 01:02:03,118
it with another one and it kind of

1492
01:01:59,838 --> 01:02:06,239
created a population explosion so I like

1493
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:09,000
the product SE salot from bioworks um

1494
01:02:06,239 --> 01:02:11,159
basilla subus I think is a great tool

1495
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:13,318
for disease prevention whether it's CE

1496
01:02:11,159 --> 01:02:15,278
or serinate or there's a host of

1497
01:02:13,318 --> 01:02:18,000
products obviously that use basilla

1498
01:02:15,278 --> 01:02:21,519
subtilus as the active ingredient and

1499
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:25,400
I've used quite a bit of that in um

1500
01:02:21,519 --> 01:02:26,920
indoor agriculture as a powdery mildew

1501
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:28,559
prevent

1502
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:31,760
um

1503
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:34,760
and we are tested for total aerobic

1504
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:38,000
count in Ohio which a lot of states are

1505
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:42,520
not like Michigan for example is not um

1506
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:44,400
and so I primarily use it in veg but did

1507
01:02:42,519 --> 01:02:47,119
use it in the beginning of flour in in

1508
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:50,160
Ohio there's a spray band after day 21

1509
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:52,240
of flour so you can't compliantly use

1510
01:02:50,159 --> 01:02:53,598
most products after day 21 there's a

1511
01:02:52,239 --> 01:02:55,838
couple products that are on the list

1512
01:02:53,599 --> 01:02:57,798
that you can use after day 21 which

1513
01:02:55,838 --> 01:02:59,318
which I think are regalia which I don't

1514
01:02:57,798 --> 01:03:01,000
know how you would use that once the bud

1515
01:02:59,318 --> 01:03:04,798
is formed because it would stay in the

1516
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:07,838
bud um and you can use things like I

1517
01:03:04,798 --> 01:03:10,639
think zerol and there might be one other

1518
01:03:07,838 --> 01:03:12,078
kind of cannabis specific product maybe

1519
01:03:10,639 --> 01:03:13,879
it's like a citric acid product or

1520
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:16,680
something like that that you can use

1521
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:18,519
toward the after day 21 but we've always

1522
01:03:16,679 --> 01:03:22,480
just done all of our sprays prior to day

1523
01:03:18,519 --> 01:03:24,079
21 which is how the compliance um was

1524
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:26,838
initially established then there was

1525
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:28,519
some lobbying for certain from certain

1526
01:03:26,838 --> 01:03:30,880
Growers to use a couple things after

1527
01:03:28,519 --> 01:03:35,639
this spray band so we've never we never

1528
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:38,160
spray after day 21 as a practice um so

1529
01:03:35,639 --> 01:03:41,038
when I was applying these microbial

1530
01:03:38,159 --> 01:03:43,798
products prior to day 21 I never had an

1531
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:46,839
issue with the plants the flower then

1532
01:03:43,798 --> 01:03:50,038
failing for total aerobic until a few

1533
01:03:46,838 --> 01:03:54,679
Cycles ago when we suddenly started to

1534
01:03:50,039 --> 01:03:57,240
see a much higher um aerobic bacteria

1535
01:03:54,679 --> 01:04:00,078
count ticking up on a lot of our dry

1536
01:03:57,239 --> 01:04:01,519
flow samples and what I had been using

1537
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:05,559
and I actually found it was very very

1538
01:04:01,519 --> 01:04:09,960
effective is I was tank mixing ferticell

1539
01:04:05,559 --> 01:04:12,559
Explorer with CE and by Tank mixing

1540
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:14,798
those I was essentially my thought was

1541
01:04:12,559 --> 01:04:16,680
first of all every time you do a ful

1542
01:04:14,798 --> 01:04:18,880
year spray it takes a substantial amount

1543
01:04:16,679 --> 01:04:21,078
of Labor and there's an REI and so you

1544
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:23,358
can only pack so many of those into a

1545
01:04:21,079 --> 01:04:26,480
cycle if you need your employees working

1546
01:04:23,358 --> 01:04:28,400
in that room and

1547
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:30,039
I in the beginning did no folar

1548
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:33,000
applications on the plants because of

1549
01:04:30,039 --> 01:04:34,599
just my fear of failing for something

1550
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:37,039
that you're spraying on the plants of

1551
01:04:34,599 --> 01:04:39,559
course so the first few years I did no

1552
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:41,119
foler applications at all then I started

1553
01:04:39,559 --> 01:04:45,000
using a little bit of the ferticell

1554
01:04:41,119 --> 01:04:47,920
Explorer which is soy protein hydrate um

1555
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:50,239
as you know like a boost to increase our

1556
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:52,798
yields a bit and give it a quick

1557
01:04:50,239 --> 01:04:56,519
bioavailable nitrogen as a foler

1558
01:04:52,798 --> 01:04:59,038
application but I was also using CE as a

1559
01:04:56,519 --> 01:05:00,559
you know biofungicide essentially and

1560
01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:04,480
then I thought well why don't I just

1561
01:05:00,559 --> 01:05:08,680
tank mix them and this way we can save

1562
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:11,400
one spray and have less REI and in doing

1563
01:05:08,679 --> 01:05:13,879
so I found that the and this is just

1564
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:15,160
Theory essentially but I think I feel

1565
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:18,278
pretty confident that this is what's

1566
01:05:15,159 --> 01:05:20,199
been going on is it was making the CE

1567
01:05:18,278 --> 01:05:21,599
the bacteria and the ceas live much

1568
01:05:20,199 --> 01:05:23,960
longer kind of go through like a

1569
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:27,359
population explosion and so I think what

1570
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:30,760
was potentially happening was by feeding

1571
01:05:27,358 --> 01:05:32,639
the bacteria like this nitrogen and also

1572
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:34,760
the nitrogen potentially being somewhat

1573
01:05:32,639 --> 01:05:37,440
sticky it was making like a sticker

1574
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:40,079
effect and we were seeing the aerobic

1575
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:42,599
counts go way way up once we tank mix

1576
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:44,798
those two products together it also was

1577
01:05:42,599 --> 01:05:46,880
very effective at controlling Pottery

1578
01:05:44,798 --> 01:05:48,440
mildew so we had previously had some

1579
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:49,838
pottery mildew in the rooms we were

1580
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:51,639
worried it was going to persist into the

1581
01:05:49,838 --> 01:05:54,759
next cycle and then we started tank

1582
01:05:51,639 --> 01:05:55,719
mixing those products it was gone and I

1583
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:59,278
mean it was like gone through the the

1584
01:05:55,719 --> 01:06:01,358
whole facility and never came back but

1585
01:05:59,278 --> 01:06:03,599
the risk is that when you're using a

1586
01:06:01,358 --> 01:06:05,838
live product that's like a basilla

1587
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:08,160
subtilus you could fail your total

1588
01:06:05,838 --> 01:06:11,880
aerobic count for something that is

1589
01:06:08,159 --> 01:06:14,399
essentially a beneficial microb and so

1590
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:18,519
you have to be very careful with folur

1591
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:21,960
because changing the mix rate or

1592
01:06:18,519 --> 01:06:23,759
changing if you're tank mixing things um

1593
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:25,880
of course you it can have unintended

1594
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:28,119
consequences and they can be beneficial

1595
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:31,440
to the health of the plant but then can

1596
01:06:28,119 --> 01:06:32,920
lead to a potential fail if you're not

1597
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:35,480
really staying on top of your test

1598
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:37,240
results and watching Trends and so once

1599
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:39,519
we started seeing that Trend we're like

1600
01:06:37,239 --> 01:06:42,439
okay this might be too much of a good

1601
01:06:39,519 --> 01:06:45,480
thing and now we need to go back to

1602
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:48,119
eliminating that or not applying them

1603
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:52,039
together so folur are always tricky and

1604
01:06:48,119 --> 01:06:54,599
I I'm just of the um philosophy of with

1605
01:06:52,039 --> 01:06:57,559
indoor production you want to be very

1606
01:06:54,599 --> 01:06:59,359
careful about how many you apply and at

1607
01:06:57,559 --> 01:07:01,960
what rates because they can persist on

1608
01:06:59,358 --> 01:07:03,639
the flour and there's no rain to wash

1609
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:06,400
them off unless you're coming back and

1610
01:07:03,639 --> 01:07:09,879
doing a water spray and removing them

1611
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:11,680
but then that creates more of a risk of

1612
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:13,240
plant disease because you're wetting the

1613
01:07:11,679 --> 01:07:15,078
plants again you know so just like in

1614
01:07:13,239 --> 01:07:16,479
vegetable production outside you want to

1615
01:07:15,079 --> 01:07:19,039
be careful about how much you wet the

1616
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:21,119
leaves and so I'm not a big fan of

1617
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:22,599
wetting leaves indoors unless of course

1618
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:23,960
you have really good air flow and you

1619
01:07:22,599 --> 01:07:26,960
know the plants are going to dry very

1620
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:26,960
quickly

1621
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:32,160
yeah I that's a really interesting

1622
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:35,278
anecdote and experience and I appreciate

1623
01:07:32,159 --> 01:07:36,759
you sharing that um I want to change

1624
01:07:35,278 --> 01:07:38,639
topics just for the sake of time because

1625
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:40,440
we've already been talking for a while

1626
01:07:38,639 --> 01:07:42,159
uh and I wanted to get one more question

1627
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:44,679
in because I know people would love to

1628
01:07:42,159 --> 01:07:46,000
hear the answer this so what is your

1629
01:07:44,679 --> 01:07:48,038
thought process around this so I know

1630
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:50,639
you don't reuse the soil because we we

1631
01:07:48,039 --> 01:07:52,599
talked about this can you explain um

1632
01:07:50,639 --> 01:07:55,879
your your reasoning behind this and why

1633
01:07:52,599 --> 01:07:57,680
that that's the your policy at Galen is

1634
01:07:55,880 --> 01:08:00,559
so I mean there's definitely been a lot

1635
01:07:57,679 --> 01:08:03,118
of push back from ownership to reuse the

1636
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:06,640
soil which I completely understand

1637
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:10,720
because the cost of buying new soil is

1638
01:08:06,639 --> 01:08:13,278
substantial um one reason though well

1639
01:08:10,719 --> 01:08:16,158
let's let's start here I am definitely a

1640
01:08:13,278 --> 01:08:18,798
proponent of reusing soil I like to

1641
01:08:16,158 --> 01:08:21,079
reuse my own soil at home all the time

1642
01:08:18,798 --> 01:08:22,960
for my garden plants my potted plants

1643
01:08:21,079 --> 01:08:25,960
flowers all these sort of things and I

1644
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:29,319
think that if you have the right system

1645
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:33,079
in place to properly reimen your soil

1646
01:08:29,319 --> 01:08:35,560
and store it properly so that you can

1647
01:08:33,079 --> 01:08:36,920
reuse it probably makes the most sense

1648
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:38,960
if you have the equipment and the

1649
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:40,679
infrastructure to be able to do that and

1650
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:42,480
the footprint that we're on we don't

1651
01:08:40,679 --> 01:08:45,640
even have enough space to park our cars

1652
01:08:42,479 --> 01:08:48,519
let alone re amend soil and store it

1653
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:53,039
outdoors and so you know we're right in

1654
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:54,560
downtown akan and we're very tight spot

1655
01:08:53,039 --> 01:08:56,399
there that we just don't have the

1656
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:57,960
infrastructure so realistically if we

1657
01:08:56,399 --> 01:09:00,399
were to reuse soil it would have to get

1658
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:03,600
hauled somewhere else re amended and

1659
01:09:00,399 --> 01:09:06,639
then sent back to us which I don't know

1660
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:09,039
if that would offset the cost very much

1661
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:11,560
um but as far as reusing a soil in the

1662
01:09:09,039 --> 01:09:13,920
same pot I mean just not possible in a

1663
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:15,759
10 gallon I mean by the end of the cycle

1664
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:18,399
these plants are all Roots I mean

1665
01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:23,000
there's really not a whole lot of soil

1666
01:09:18,399 --> 01:09:26,719
left but um what I have done to kind of

1667
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:30,238
find The Best of Both Worlds there is um

1668
01:09:26,719 --> 01:09:32,198
first before galenus established their

1669
01:09:30,238 --> 01:09:34,119
Michigan facility which has now been up

1670
01:09:32,198 --> 01:09:36,119
and running for three years I was

1671
01:09:34,119 --> 01:09:38,119
donating all that soil to a community

1672
01:09:36,119 --> 01:09:40,759
garden group called let's grow akan and

1673
01:09:38,119 --> 01:09:44,000
they were gladly bringing a truck every

1674
01:09:40,759 --> 01:09:45,279
month to fill up with all the spent soil

1675
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:47,798
and take that out to their Community

1676
01:09:45,279 --> 01:09:49,600
Gardens and use it to build their beds

1677
01:09:47,798 --> 01:09:51,960
um so that went on for about a year and

1678
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:54,320
a half then once the galenus Michigan

1679
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:56,560
grow was in effect I talked with our

1680
01:09:54,319 --> 01:09:58,880
compliance agents made sure that it was

1681
01:09:56,560 --> 01:10:00,800
okay that we could ship root the you

1682
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:03,000
know chop the plants down and ship the

1683
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:06,360
root ball and the soil to our Michigan

1684
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:08,520
grow and that has been great in the

1685
01:10:06,359 --> 01:10:10,559
sense that we put it directly into the

1686
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:14,000
field and we've taken a field of Seven

1687
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:16,400
Acres that was almost pure clay and

1688
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:18,560
really dramatically improved it by

1689
01:10:16,399 --> 01:10:21,639
adding these hundreds of yards of soil

1690
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:24,320
quarterly to the outdoor beds so it does

1691
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:27,400
get reused it only gets reused in the

1692
01:10:24,319 --> 01:10:30,039
other facility outdoor doors um the

1693
01:10:27,399 --> 01:10:34,559
other reason that I'm just hesitant to

1694
01:10:30,039 --> 01:10:37,920
reuse soil indoors is because I really

1695
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:40,039
with such a a short cycle I really need

1696
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:42,000
things to be I don't want to say perfect

1697
01:10:40,039 --> 01:10:44,960
because not every batch of soil is

1698
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:47,800
exactly the same but I need it to be as

1699
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:49,920
optimized as possible coming in so that

1700
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:51,560
there's just no downtime you know so

1701
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:54,199
that the plants have everything they

1702
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:58,239
need as far as soil structure nutrient

1703
01:10:54,198 --> 01:11:01,759
level all that as close to perfect as it

1704
01:10:58,238 --> 01:11:03,718
can be each cycle so there's not a sday

1705
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:05,719
period of time where I'm figuring out

1706
01:11:03,719 --> 01:11:07,279
why the plant isn't performing how I

1707
01:11:05,719 --> 01:11:09,399
expected it to you know it's such a

1708
01:11:07,279 --> 01:11:12,238
compressed cycle that it's just really

1709
01:11:09,399 --> 01:11:16,000
important for things to start as perfect

1710
01:11:12,238 --> 01:11:17,919
as possible in my opinion and so um I'm

1711
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:20,439
glad that we have this outlet that we

1712
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:23,920
can send the soil and it can be used

1713
01:11:20,439 --> 01:11:25,879
Outdoors um I think that working with a

1714
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:27,760
community garden group or working with

1715
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:31,760
another Farm to take that soil and

1716
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:35,520
repurpose it is a total excellent waist

1717
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:37,760
stream management um process because it

1718
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:40,000
still has a lot of value it just doesn't

1719
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:44,159
have the value that I need it for to

1720
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:47,079
grow a crop in this you know system that

1721
01:11:44,158 --> 01:11:48,519
I need to produce a certain yield each

1722
01:11:47,079 --> 01:11:50,559
and every time and a certain quality

1723
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:52,960
each and every

1724
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:55,239
time great yeah so it sounds like it's a

1725
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:56,840
risk risk management as well as aace

1726
01:11:55,238 --> 01:11:59,638
space limitation issue for you

1727
01:11:56,840 --> 01:12:01,319
definitely that I think that's you know

1728
01:11:59,639 --> 01:12:03,279
I think that's great that you able to

1729
01:12:01,319 --> 01:12:04,519
kind of explain the thought process

1730
01:12:03,279 --> 01:12:07,399
behind it because I knew people would

1731
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:09,840
ask so thank you for sharing that yeah I

1732
01:12:07,399 --> 01:12:11,960
I just wanted to mention too um one I I

1733
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:15,239
kind of call it my secret weapon but I

1734
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:17,600
do add I do a lot with vermac composting

1735
01:12:15,238 --> 01:12:19,479
at the grow and again that was something

1736
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:22,639
that was a little bit difficult to bring

1737
01:12:19,479 --> 01:12:24,319
into production um in the facility so

1738
01:12:22,639 --> 01:12:26,840
I've now set it up outside of the

1739
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:28,759
facility because of the just the bugs

1740
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:31,079
and stuff you know that you get

1741
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:33,760
obviously when you have like some really

1742
01:12:31,079 --> 01:12:35,960
vibrant worm bins um but now that we've

1743
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:39,480
established these outdoor worm bins

1744
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:41,560
bringing in the vermac compost um using

1745
01:12:39,479 --> 01:12:44,039
that in like an extract on a weekly

1746
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:46,800
basis or even bi-weekly basis in the veg

1747
01:12:44,039 --> 01:12:50,920
cycle has made like a dramatic

1748
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:52,719
improvement in our plant health and I

1749
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:54,600
found a review which maybe you could put

1750
01:12:52,719 --> 01:12:56,198
up on your page that I've been I've been

1751
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:58,440
even like caring it around with me for

1752
01:12:56,198 --> 01:13:00,479
the past six or eight months because I

1753
01:12:58,439 --> 01:13:02,039
keep kind of looking back and forth at

1754
01:13:00,479 --> 01:13:03,839
it when I'm at work and thinking about

1755
01:13:02,039 --> 01:13:06,519
why is this working so good why are

1756
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:08,520
these worm castings that I make here why

1757
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:11,360
are they so effective and it's something

1758
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:13,040
that I I was taught as when I first

1759
01:13:11,359 --> 01:13:15,238
started farming for Great Lakes Brewing

1760
01:13:13,039 --> 01:13:18,479
Company by another person who was a big

1761
01:13:15,238 --> 01:13:20,439
proponent of um worm farming but I've

1762
01:13:18,479 --> 01:13:24,039
always used it in my vegetable

1763
01:13:20,439 --> 01:13:25,960
production models in my home grow and

1764
01:13:24,039 --> 01:13:28,519
everything and I found that it's really

1765
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:30,760
not that difficult to create your own

1766
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:33,760
worm castings and use them in an indoor

1767
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:35,760
commercial application um it doesn't

1768
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:38,960
take a lot you know so they're really

1769
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:42,320
packed with nutrients and enzymes and

1770
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:45,158
microbes and you can multiply that out

1771
01:13:42,319 --> 01:13:46,960
in an extract and hit a thousand plants

1772
01:13:45,158 --> 01:13:49,519
with them and really get a lot of bang

1773
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:51,119
for your buck with your own worm

1774
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:53,360
castings I've tried package worm

1775
01:13:51,119 --> 01:13:55,279
castings prepackaged worm castings I

1776
01:13:53,359 --> 01:13:58,000
just don't find them to be as live or

1777
01:13:55,279 --> 01:14:00,279
effective as what I find when I make my

1778
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:03,800
own worm castings and I think that it's

1779
01:14:00,279 --> 01:14:06,840
just a really undeveloped tool still for

1780
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:10,679
commercial Growers to really revamp

1781
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:15,319
their microbial activities of their

1782
01:14:10,679 --> 01:14:17,520
soils and also just basically provide

1783
01:14:15,319 --> 01:14:19,079
more bioavailable nutrients and have

1784
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:20,120
like you know like the humic substances

1785
01:14:19,079 --> 01:14:22,679
and all the different things that come

1786
01:14:20,119 --> 01:14:25,639
from worm castings packaged right in

1787
01:14:22,679 --> 01:14:27,158
there so that you're breaking down the

1788
01:14:25,639 --> 01:14:28,840
nutrients that are in the soil more

1789
01:14:27,158 --> 01:14:31,719
quickly and providing them in like a

1790
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:35,039
plant available format much more quickly

1791
01:14:31,719 --> 01:14:37,840
and I I just see incredible difference

1792
01:14:35,039 --> 01:14:41,880
even especially in the veg cycle where

1793
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:43,719
we'll apply a worm casting um extract on

1794
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:45,920
Friday and it's like the plants have

1795
01:14:43,719 --> 01:14:48,079
like doubled in size on Monday it's just

1796
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:50,480
it's just really unbelievable all the

1797
01:14:48,079 --> 01:14:52,519
benefits that Verma compost has with

1798
01:14:50,479 --> 01:14:55,119
cannabis it's I think they're meant

1799
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:57,520
meant to be for sure

1800
01:14:55,119 --> 01:14:59,760
yeah I'll share the link to the to the

1801
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:02,440
paper uh on the podcast page for people

1802
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:05,480
that are interested and uh just really

1803
01:15:02,439 --> 01:15:06,839
quickly what is your um bedding that

1804
01:15:05,479 --> 01:15:10,238
you're using and what are you feeding

1805
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:13,920
your worms just so the worms are just

1806
01:15:10,238 --> 01:15:15,559
getting all food scraps and I have my

1807
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:17,440
employees all that are interested in

1808
01:15:15,560 --> 01:15:19,800
bringing in their food scraps take home

1809
01:15:17,439 --> 01:15:22,719
a three gallon bucket once a week and

1810
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:24,719
they bring it back on Tuesdays full of

1811
01:15:22,719 --> 01:15:25,600
compost and we feed that directly to the

1812
01:15:24,719 --> 01:15:27,880
worm

1813
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:29,440
I do also use a lot of the like when you

1814
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:32,079
buy an Amazon package and you get that

1815
01:15:29,439 --> 01:15:34,759
brown paper that's the packing material

1816
01:15:32,079 --> 01:15:36,880
you know as a as a uh bigger operation

1817
01:15:34,760 --> 01:15:39,079
we get a lot of Amazon packages and so

1818
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:41,480
we get a lot of that brown packing paper

1819
01:15:39,079 --> 01:15:43,760
and so I like using that um and then I

1820
01:15:41,479 --> 01:15:45,039
just tell my employees that bring back

1821
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:47,480
their food scraps you know it's

1822
01:15:45,039 --> 01:15:49,359
everything pre-plate nothing post plate

1823
01:15:47,479 --> 01:15:51,039
so we don't have like salad dressings

1824
01:15:49,359 --> 01:15:52,519
and things like that involved so it's

1825
01:15:51,039 --> 01:15:55,760
just your

1826
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:58,840
pre-plate um vegetable trimmings

1827
01:15:55,760 --> 01:16:00,800
eggshells uh coffee grounds coffee

1828
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:03,520
filters any sort of fruits and

1829
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:06,400
vegetables without a super concentration

1830
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:08,159
of sometimes like I think it's it's good

1831
01:16:06,399 --> 01:16:10,319
to just have a good mix like not all

1832
01:16:08,158 --> 01:16:12,479
onions or not all lemons or things like

1833
01:16:10,319 --> 01:16:14,479
that so you just don't swing your pH too

1834
01:16:12,479 --> 01:16:17,359
much in your worm bin but overall it's

1835
01:16:14,479 --> 01:16:19,238
just it's just food scraps and brown

1836
01:16:17,359 --> 01:16:23,479
carbon type papers

1837
01:16:19,238 --> 01:16:26,839
newspapers um Brown packing paper and no

1838
01:16:23,479 --> 01:16:29,718
soil just straight food scraps I have

1839
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:31,679
four large bins now I like to make my

1840
01:16:29,719 --> 01:16:34,119
bins so that the worms can go into the

1841
01:16:31,679 --> 01:16:36,039
ground when it gets really cold outside

1842
01:16:34,119 --> 01:16:38,039
so I use hardware cloth underneath the

1843
01:16:36,039 --> 01:16:39,920
bins and cut big round holes in the

1844
01:16:38,039 --> 01:16:41,679
bottom of the bins that way they can

1845
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:43,399
just migrate into the soil if it gets

1846
01:16:41,679 --> 01:16:46,319
too cold you're not killing your worms

1847
01:16:43,399 --> 01:16:47,719
and like a real deep freeze and I found

1848
01:16:46,319 --> 01:16:49,079
just from my own personal experience

1849
01:16:47,719 --> 01:16:51,840
I've had one of these bins in my

1850
01:16:49,079 --> 01:16:53,279
backyard that most of the time they stay

1851
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:56,360
through the whole winter as long as you

1852
01:16:53,279 --> 01:16:59,279
keep feed feeding them but if not they

1853
01:16:56,359 --> 01:17:01,519
repopulate again in the spring and I

1854
01:16:59,279 --> 01:17:03,359
just manage them so that you know I

1855
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:05,080
always have old castings toward the back

1856
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:06,839
of the bin and feeding in the fresh food

1857
01:17:05,079 --> 01:17:08,479
at the front of the bin so that when we

1858
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:10,199
do pull the castings there's not a ton

1859
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:12,039
of worms left in them but if there are

1860
01:17:10,198 --> 01:17:13,799
we do put them in the pots you know

1861
01:17:12,039 --> 01:17:15,600
because they will make their way back

1862
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:17,520
out into the world and they do live

1863
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:19,600
through the whole cycle but we try not

1864
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:22,440
to put too many of them many of them in

1865
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:24,480
the pots so it's primarily just worm

1866
01:17:22,439 --> 01:17:28,000
castings put into like a large compost

1867
01:17:24,479 --> 01:17:32,319
tea bag bag soaked in 40 gallons of

1868
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:33,760
water and kind of massaging the the bag

1869
01:17:32,319 --> 01:17:35,279
so that you're getting all the extract

1870
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:37,639
into the water and then watering that

1871
01:17:35,279 --> 01:17:40,238
into the plants once or twice a week

1872
01:17:37,639 --> 01:17:42,440
through veg into like week one of flow

1873
01:17:40,238 --> 01:17:44,039
if if there's the time for it but

1874
01:17:42,439 --> 01:17:46,079
especially in the veg cycle I feel like

1875
01:17:44,039 --> 01:17:48,479
it's just like a total inoculant that

1876
01:17:46,079 --> 01:17:52,679
then you're creating like a biodiversity

1877
01:17:48,479 --> 01:17:54,479
there that starts the whole cycle of

1878
01:17:52,679 --> 01:17:56,719
beneficial growth for the plant and I

1879
01:17:54,479 --> 01:17:58,319
mean it in that review there's even one

1880
01:17:56,719 --> 01:18:00,800
study that was done on cannabis and

1881
01:17:58,319 --> 01:18:04,559
vermac compost that showed that even if

1882
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:08,159
you soaked seed in vermac compost

1883
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:09,960
extract that they saw greater yield down

1884
01:18:08,158 --> 01:18:12,000
uh the road with the Cannabis just from

1885
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:14,439
Simply soaking the seed so I think on

1886
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:16,079
the inoculation side there's really a

1887
01:18:14,439 --> 01:18:19,719
lot that we still haven't learned about

1888
01:18:16,079 --> 01:18:22,439
how beneficial this can actually be for

1889
01:18:19,719 --> 01:18:24,520
cannabis yeah a few thoughts on this so

1890
01:18:22,439 --> 01:18:27,439
uh and again I will the article will be

1891
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:30,159
aailable on the podcast page um vermac

1892
01:18:27,439 --> 01:18:31,960
compost is incredible the way that worms

1893
01:18:30,158 --> 01:18:33,599
are able to take and translocate

1894
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:36,800
nutrients into more plant available

1895
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:40,360
forms um increase biological diversity

1896
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:42,279
and nutrient cycling in soils um they

1897
01:18:40,359 --> 01:18:46,198
have a ton of a ton of incredible

1898
01:18:42,279 --> 01:18:48,800
benefits uh the things that I think of

1899
01:18:46,198 --> 01:18:51,158
also though with um this is when we talk

1900
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:52,800
about consistency and we talk about

1901
01:18:51,158 --> 01:18:55,399
compost or Verma compost I just want to

1902
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:57,199
remind listeners that um

1903
01:18:55,399 --> 01:18:58,759
that's not we're not all applying the

1904
01:18:57,198 --> 01:19:00,000
same thing so the vermac compost Us in

1905
01:18:58,760 --> 01:19:02,320
these studies is probably different than

1906
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:03,840
your vermac compost so I think triing

1907
01:19:02,319 --> 01:19:05,039
this is really important and seeing what

1908
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:06,560
results you're getting obviously your

1909
01:19:05,039 --> 01:19:09,840
mix is working really well in your

1910
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:11,360
facility um and I think in general it's

1911
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:15,000
it's much harder to screw up Verma

1912
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:15,960
compost then it is compost but um yeah

1913
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,679
that's just something I want to throw

1914
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:20,039
out there because with with compost te

1915
01:19:17,679 --> 01:19:22,480
for example people take research on that

1916
01:19:20,039 --> 01:19:25,198
and try and extrapolate results and

1917
01:19:22,479 --> 01:19:28,198
every tea is different just even even

1918
01:19:25,198 --> 01:19:30,000
more so than when making an extract so I

1919
01:19:28,198 --> 01:19:31,960
just want to mention that and I think

1920
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:34,399
the freshness is really important too

1921
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:35,880
sorry but I think oh no no yeah well I

1922
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:38,759
think there's something to that I think

1923
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:41,560
you could maybe achieve if you were to

1924
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:44,400
use packaged or commercial uh Verma

1925
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:46,320
compost to you know get it to the right

1926
01:19:44,399 --> 01:19:48,119
moisture level again maybe add some food

1927
01:19:46,319 --> 01:19:50,279
sources to it to reinvigorate the

1928
01:19:48,119 --> 01:19:52,519
microbes you could maybe get back to the

1929
01:19:50,279 --> 01:19:54,359
same level of what you're achieving um

1930
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:56,639
or at least closer to it based on what

1931
01:19:54,359 --> 01:19:58,439
you're sharing there for sure um the

1932
01:19:56,639 --> 01:20:00,159
only other thing I want to mention and

1933
01:19:58,439 --> 01:20:05,359
I've been hearing more and more about is

1934
01:20:00,158 --> 01:20:08,279
this idea of um pfas or or past being in

1935
01:20:05,359 --> 01:20:10,799
cardboard and so I've moved away using

1936
01:20:08,279 --> 01:20:12,960
it for Sheet mulching and I do wonder if

1937
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:15,079
it if some of it could and again I don't

1938
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:17,439
know how this is broken down by worms or

1939
01:20:15,079 --> 01:20:21,920
by things but I've moved away from using

1940
01:20:17,439 --> 01:20:24,439
it as bedding to in in in worm bins for

1941
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:26,239
that reason but again this is some this

1942
01:20:24,439 --> 01:20:28,839
is a really new thing we're still

1943
01:20:26,238 --> 01:20:30,519
learning about it we're we don't even

1944
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:31,719
have available testing for it in most

1945
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:34,199
cases and it's certainly not being

1946
01:20:31,719 --> 01:20:36,399
tested for in the cannabus industry but

1947
01:20:34,198 --> 01:20:38,839
um I I don't know it seems like with

1948
01:20:36,399 --> 01:20:41,359
microplastics and beef acid everything

1949
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:43,199
definitely I I get it's it's funny I

1950
01:20:41,359 --> 01:20:45,158
know and and and it's with so many

1951
01:20:43,198 --> 01:20:46,759
things you know because everything has

1952
01:20:45,158 --> 01:20:49,279
some amount of heavy metals and

1953
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:51,199
everything has some amount of of

1954
01:20:49,279 --> 01:20:53,359
plastics and things like that that you

1955
01:20:51,198 --> 01:20:55,799
know you really there's nothing that's

1956
01:20:53,359 --> 01:20:58,519
pure and nothing that's truly clean but

1957
01:20:55,800 --> 01:21:00,679
I think that as this review is pointing

1958
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:03,400
out there's there's an incredible amount

1959
01:21:00,679 --> 01:21:06,158
of remediation that these microbes that

1960
01:21:03,399 --> 01:21:08,399
are either in the worm's gut or that

1961
01:21:06,158 --> 01:21:11,158
kind of Co coexist in a symbiotic

1962
01:21:08,399 --> 01:21:13,960
relationship with worms have an effect

1963
01:21:11,158 --> 01:21:15,920
of being able to biodegrade even things

1964
01:21:13,960 --> 01:21:17,840
like these types of chemicals that we're

1965
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:19,319
finding from Plastics I I believe in

1966
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:21,319
that study it did even point something

1967
01:21:19,319 --> 01:21:24,960
out about Pest and I think there's a lot

1968
01:21:21,319 --> 01:21:27,439
of um a lot of real value to the the

1969
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:30,239
sort of remediation factor that vermac

1970
01:21:27,439 --> 01:21:32,799
compost provides that could you know

1971
01:21:30,238 --> 01:21:34,839
even potentially remediate things that

1972
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:36,880
are in the soil prior to adding the

1973
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:40,159
vermac compost such as heavy metals you

1974
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:43,079
know and so I think that um it's quite

1975
01:21:40,158 --> 01:21:47,559
an interesting compound that vermac

1976
01:21:43,079 --> 01:21:49,920
compost creates and I like I said using

1977
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:51,800
it fresh I think makes a big difference

1978
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:54,880
because all of these enzymes and

1979
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:57,560
different um microbial all this microb

1980
01:21:54,880 --> 01:22:01,639
activity is just is still so vibrant and

1981
01:21:57,560 --> 01:22:04,159
diverse and I think that it's really

1982
01:22:01,639 --> 01:22:06,719
kind of a new frontier of Agriculture

1983
01:22:04,158 --> 01:22:08,759
and it's interesting because in indoor

1984
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:10,840
agriculture it's somewhat more

1985
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:13,079
applicable you know in the field of

1986
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:16,279
course and I did a lot of sheet sheet um

1987
01:22:13,079 --> 01:22:17,960
composting in my field with spent grains

1988
01:22:16,279 --> 01:22:20,039
from the brewery process which is a

1989
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:21,399
great warm food by the way spent grain

1990
01:22:20,039 --> 01:22:22,719
and they love that would come up and

1991
01:22:21,399 --> 01:22:24,839
feed on it you could really build your

1992
01:22:22,719 --> 01:22:26,760
worm populations with spent grain but I

1993
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:29,079
did a lot of sheet composting using

1994
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:32,480
cardboard and things like that for

1995
01:22:29,079 --> 01:22:34,519
mulches and um you can obviously

1996
01:22:32,479 --> 01:22:37,519
encourage large worm populations and

1997
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:38,840
maybe there's some degree of of toxic

1998
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:41,360
compounds and some of these things that

1999
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:44,039
we're using that could negatively

2000
01:22:41,359 --> 01:22:47,198
contribute to your soil Health but um in

2001
01:22:44,039 --> 01:22:49,600
indoor applications it's difficult to

2002
01:22:47,198 --> 01:22:51,359
find something that you can make in sort

2003
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:53,679
of a small amount that doesn't take a

2004
01:22:51,359 --> 01:22:55,559
lot of work but you can spread it out

2005
01:22:53,679 --> 01:22:57,719
and get the benefit to all the plants in

2006
01:22:55,560 --> 01:23:00,719
the form of an inoculant and I just

2007
01:22:57,719 --> 01:23:02,800
really feel like vermac composting is

2008
01:23:00,719 --> 01:23:04,760
one of those sort of special things that

2009
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:06,719
you can actually instead of just buying

2010
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:09,880
you know your inputs you can create your

2011
01:23:06,719 --> 01:23:11,840
own live input in a very simplified

2012
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:13,520
manner that doesn't take very much work

2013
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:15,360
and it's actually quite engaging to the

2014
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:17,840
employees to be able to bring in their

2015
01:23:15,359 --> 01:23:19,839
compost and see it broken down by worms

2016
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:22,199
and go back to contributing to the plant

2017
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:24,679
Health it's actually really stimulated

2018
01:23:22,198 --> 01:23:27,158
some people to start composting at home

2019
01:23:24,679 --> 01:23:30,000
who were not composting previously and

2020
01:23:27,158 --> 01:23:31,920
so um it's something that's small but

2021
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:34,560
that you can multiply out on a fairly

2022
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:36,319
large scale and provide like a really

2023
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:39,320
substantial amount of benefit to your

2024
01:23:36,319 --> 01:23:41,279
plants um through a very simple and

2025
01:23:39,319 --> 01:23:44,359
small sort of system that doesn't take

2026
01:23:41,279 --> 01:23:47,079
very much work so for me it was one way

2027
01:23:44,359 --> 01:23:50,880
of bringing sort of that outdoor

2028
01:23:47,079 --> 01:23:54,158
regenerative agricultural World indoors

2029
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:56,239
in a system that so far at least I

2030
01:23:54,158 --> 01:23:58,759
haven't hav't seen any negatives in the

2031
01:23:56,238 --> 01:24:02,119
sense of higher heavy metal loads on my

2032
01:23:58,760 --> 01:24:04,440
flower or you know a microbe that might

2033
01:24:02,119 --> 01:24:07,158
be problematic so I think there's like

2034
01:24:04,439 --> 01:24:09,479
some degree of balance that these

2035
01:24:07,158 --> 01:24:12,638
microbes create that are working you

2036
01:24:09,479 --> 01:24:14,519
know like in harmony to balance the

2037
01:24:12,639 --> 01:24:17,079
negative pathogens and there's there's a

2038
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:19,520
lot of detail in that um review too

2039
01:24:17,079 --> 01:24:22,119
about the pathogen suppressing benefits

2040
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:24,840
of vermac compost to even be able to you

2041
01:24:22,119 --> 01:24:26,840
know like negate things like Fusion and

2042
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:29,800
and plant diseases that are very serious

2043
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:32,639
for cannabis that could be potentially

2044
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:35,279
offset or prevented by using vermac

2045
01:24:32,639 --> 01:24:38,039
compost so a lot of interesting stuff a

2046
01:24:35,279 --> 01:24:40,960
lot of interesting uses for

2047
01:24:38,039 --> 01:24:42,439
cannabis yeah absolutely I Verma compost

2048
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:44,840
is amazing there's a lot of different

2049
01:24:42,439 --> 01:24:46,519
ways we can use it in our Gardens and I

2050
01:24:44,840 --> 01:24:48,560
I highly recommend that people

2051
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:51,719
definitely set up their own worm bent

2052
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:53,080
yeah know that's great advice thanks

2053
01:24:51,719 --> 01:24:55,480
well thank you so much for your time

2054
01:24:53,079 --> 01:24:56,880
today I really app it I know there's a

2055
01:24:55,479 --> 01:24:59,198
lot more we can talk about we may have

2056
01:24:56,880 --> 01:25:01,719
to schedule another chat sometime in the

2057
01:24:59,198 --> 01:25:03,879
near future well it was really fun I

2058
01:25:01,719 --> 01:25:05,560
appreciate you having me Tad honestly

2059
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:08,039
when I launched into the Cannabis

2060
01:25:05,560 --> 01:25:11,159
industry like almost six years ago your

2061
01:25:08,039 --> 01:25:13,760
podcast gave me a ton of knowledge and

2062
01:25:11,158 --> 01:25:16,039
confidence to be able to do the things

2063
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:18,199
that I do now so I think the

2064
01:25:16,039 --> 01:25:21,000
collaboration that you provide to the

2065
01:25:18,198 --> 01:25:23,000
industry is I it just can't be valued

2066
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:24,520
enough there's still unfortunately a lot

2067
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:26,639
of people that are very tight lipped

2068
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:28,480
about what they do and what techniques

2069
01:25:26,639 --> 01:25:30,800
are working for them or not working for

2070
01:25:28,479 --> 01:25:33,198
them and it holds back the industry as a

2071
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:34,920
whole um in vegetable production there

2072
01:25:33,198 --> 01:25:36,879
was much more collaboration much more

2073
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:40,000
sharing of information and when I

2074
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:42,679
stepped into cannabis I felt like closed

2075
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:44,800
off to other farmers and your podcast

2076
01:25:42,679 --> 01:25:46,158
really um it's very exciting for me to

2077
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:48,880
be here because it's kind of come full

2078
01:25:46,158 --> 01:25:50,638
circle that it was so beneficial for me

2079
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:52,159
to hear these voices and I've networked

2080
01:25:50,639 --> 01:25:56,079
with a lot of people that you've had on

2081
01:25:52,158 --> 01:25:58,238
the podcast now and created long lasting

2082
01:25:56,079 --> 01:26:00,519
relationships with people specifically

2083
01:25:58,238 --> 01:26:02,559
from hearing them here so I appreciate

2084
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:06,600
what you do that's great I love that

2085
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:08,920
that's great yeah well again thank you

2086
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:10,320
so much and uh I hope we can stay in

2087
01:26:08,920 --> 01:26:11,399
touch because I think I think you're

2088
01:26:10,319 --> 01:26:14,479
totally right the more we can

2089
01:26:11,399 --> 01:26:16,920
collaborate in this industry uh the more

2090
01:26:14,479 --> 01:26:18,799
transparency we have the the better off

2091
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:20,520
we all are and especially in promoting

2092
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:22,639
this side of the industry this this

2093
01:26:20,520 --> 01:26:25,480
concept of you know regenerative

2094
01:26:22,639 --> 01:26:28,039
agriculture and uh you know more

2095
01:26:25,479 --> 01:26:30,638
sustainable cultivation and Organics and

2096
01:26:28,039 --> 01:26:32,600
things like that so absolutely I see it

2097
01:26:30,639 --> 01:26:34,880
in the in the Craft brewery industry all

2098
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:36,480
the time and my husband being a brewer

2099
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:38,199
he's even said to me like you know all

2100
01:26:36,479 --> 01:26:40,839
these Brewers come from other breweries

2101
01:26:38,198 --> 01:26:42,599
all the time we open open the doors and

2102
01:26:40,840 --> 01:26:44,440
and we greet them with open arms and we

2103
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:46,800
share knowledge and share products and

2104
01:26:44,439 --> 01:26:48,839
it's part of what makes craft brewing so

2105
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:51,560
special and I think it's it's finally

2106
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:53,159
kind of coming full circle um in Ohio

2107
01:26:51,560 --> 01:26:55,440
where there is a lot more collaboration

2108
01:26:53,158 --> 01:26:57,279
now and industrywide I I hope to see it

2109
01:26:55,439 --> 01:26:58,638
just get better and better with the

2110
01:26:57,279 --> 01:27:02,198
education and the knowledge and the

2111
01:26:58,639 --> 01:27:02,199
sharing so I think we're on the right

2112
01:27:03,039 --> 01:27:06,800
track all right
