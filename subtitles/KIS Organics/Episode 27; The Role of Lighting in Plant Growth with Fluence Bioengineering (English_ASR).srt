00:00:14,929 --> 00:00:18,600
welcome to the cannabis cultivation and

3
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,240
science podcast

4
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,699
I'm your host tad hussy of KISS organics

5
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:25,379
this is the podcast where we discuss the

6
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:27,420
cutting edge of organic growing from a

7
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:29,189
science-based perspective and drawn top

8
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,170
experts from around the industry to

9
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:32,278
share their wisdom and knowledge you

10
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:34,770
know it's about time that I did a

11
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,420
podcast focus just on lighting this is

12
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:38,070
not a topic that I'm all that strong on

13
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,780
so it was great to sit down with some

14
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:42,119
experts in the field and get to ask some

15
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,160
questions to learn more my guests this

16
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:46,890
week are Travis Williams and Travis

17
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:48,718
Higginbotham yes - Travis's so it's a

18
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,128
little tricky to tell them apart but

19
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,808
between the two of them we get to hear

20
00:00:50,128 --> 00:00:54,420
about very different aspects of the

21
00:00:51,808 --> 00:00:56,009
lighting industry Travis Williams is the

22
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,929
director of brand marketing and fluence

23
00:00:56,009 --> 00:01:00,119
bioengineering he is passionate about

24
00:00:57,929 --> 00:01:02,460
clean energy sustainability and

25
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:04,319
controlled environment agriculture his

26
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,879
job allows him to help growers navigate

27
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,649
the challenging and complex world of

28
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:08,989
horticultural lighting to realize

29
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,368
improvements in crop production

30
00:01:08,989 --> 00:01:14,429
sustainability and profits through LED

31
00:01:11,368 --> 00:01:16,438
technology Travis Higginbotham is the

32
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:18,689
new director of cultivation support for

33
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:19,709
fluency prior to working influence he

34
00:01:18,688 --> 00:01:21,449
worked at a state-of-the-art

35
00:01:19,709 --> 00:01:23,548
environmentally controlled greenhouse

36
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,900
covering 50 acres where he was the head

37
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:27,150
of research and development

38
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,770
they grew annual and perennial crops for

39
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:31,409
big-box retailers supplying the

40
00:01:28,769 --> 00:01:34,259
Northeast United States his focus was on

41
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:36,509
rearing beneficial insects IPM protocols

42
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:38,549
disease testing and trialing new

43
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:40,140
genetics from around the world he

44
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:42,360
recently received his master's in

45
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,280
horticulture from Virginia Tech where he

46
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:46,500
did some work around LED research in

47
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,320
regards to sole source supplemental and

48
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,420
photo periodic lighting this resulted in

49
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:53,279
equipping irrigation booms with lights

50
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,259
for photo periodic flowering

51
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,599
applications to a controlled environment

52
00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:00,090
where he propagated over 1.2 million

53
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:02,218
perennials from stage 3 tissue culture

54
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:05,070
per year he also has a Bachelors of

55
00:02:02,218 --> 00:02:07,048
Science from Clemson University in this

56
00:02:05,069 --> 00:02:08,459
podcast we go over a bit of the history

57
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:10,439
of lighting as it relates to growing

58
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:12,599
plants as well as the future of lighting

59
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:15,449
and what exciting research is currently

60
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:16,799
done in the industry all right hey guys

61
00:02:15,449 --> 00:02:18,899
I really want to thank you today for

62
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,330
coming out and chatting with me about

63
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:24,599
lighting well thank you for having us

64
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:25,110
yep Thank You Pat yeah so I think I get

65
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:26,370
started

66
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:28,590
finding out a little bit about your

67
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:30,689
background now we have two Travis's here

68
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:32,759
so maybe Travis Williams you can tell us

69
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:35,490
a little bit more about how you came to

70
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:41,579
the role that you have now yeah yeah

71
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:44,790
gladly so I spent about 13 years in high

72
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:46,950
tech marketing the last three of those

73
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:49,469
years have been with fluence and then

74
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:51,689
the decade before that was across

75
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:54,359
different industries and both high tech

76
00:02:51,689 --> 00:02:58,280
and green tech everything from embedded

77
00:02:54,360 --> 00:03:01,860
systems to alternative fuels all b2b

78
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:03,180
companies large and small with

79
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,190
accordance assist on efficiency and

80
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:07,439
really moving the world towards a more

81
00:03:05,189 --> 00:03:09,539
sustainable efficient future with all

82
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:10,829
kinds of different technologies and then

83
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:12,959
about three years ago I started to see

84
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:16,550
the convergence of technology and

85
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:18,960
horticulture with vertical farming and

86
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:20,910
different technologies that were coming

87
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,920
online and that's really what spurred my

88
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:24,990
interest in looking at how to how to

89
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:26,639
take technology and make it very

90
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:30,300
applicable to our agriculture industry

91
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:32,250
and our food supply chain and so I

92
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:35,730
joined fluence about three years ago

93
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:37,710
when it was a BML horticulture small

94
00:03:35,729 --> 00:03:40,590
small company back then about there was

95
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:43,560
about 10 of us and it's been a pretty

96
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:46,229
wild ride ever since quite quite a

97
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,300
different industry and the horticulture

98
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:50,699
lighting space than the industries of

99
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:52,950
the custom - those were very large

100
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:55,799
established industries with standards

101
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:58,679
and protocols and this has been kind of

102
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:00,240
like the Wild West so it's it's been

103
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,379
great to see it evolve even over the

104
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,790
last three years and I look forward to

105
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:08,370
seeing where it goes over there over the

106
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:10,259
next decade or so very cool and now the

107
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:12,420
other Travis came recommended me by

108
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:13,919
Suzanne Wainwright Evans the bug lady

109
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:17,009
she said if you want to talk to someone

110
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:18,329
about lighting she was she had she had

111
00:04:17,009 --> 00:04:19,889
met you and said that you've just been

112
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:22,019
hired by fluence which worked out really

113
00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:24,300
well since I'd already been talking

114
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:25,740
about having someone from fluence on can

115
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,240
you talk briefly about what your

116
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:30,850
background is

117
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:33,129
sure it would be happy to so the past

118
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:35,200
five years I've worked in the ornamental

119
00:04:33,129 --> 00:04:37,810
market so like annuals perennials and

120
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,399
flowering crops and what I did there is

121
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:41,740
I worked for a commercial greenhouse in

122
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:44,500
Virginia and I directed their research

123
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:48,460
and development so we did everything

124
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:51,790
from rearing of microorganisms for bio

125
00:04:48,459 --> 00:04:53,519
controls to using light in multiple

126
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:56,980
environments controlled environments

127
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:59,919
supplemental I'm using it on you know

128
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:04,120
different machinery for photo period and

129
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:06,689
flowering to introducing new products to

130
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,620
market new genetics new varieties

131
00:05:06,689 --> 00:05:11,740
trialing them in the greenhouse in the

132
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:14,019
landscape so I wore many hats let's just

133
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:18,639
say in that regard to to what my role

134
00:05:14,019 --> 00:05:20,680
was they're very cool I I'm new to

135
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,719
lighting this isn't my area of expertise

136
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:25,180
by any means so I may ask some really

137
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:28,810
dumb questions I learned a lot at photo

138
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:31,480
X this past year in terms of lighting

139
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:33,250
but just for listeners who aren't as

140
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:35,470
experienced with lighting can we go over

141
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:37,000
some of this the basic terminology that

142
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:38,580
people should know when it comes to

143
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,459
understanding horticultural lighting

144
00:05:38,579 --> 00:05:44,079
yeah yeah absolutely and and yeah I

145
00:05:42,459 --> 00:05:46,750
think this is probably the foundation

146
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:48,579
where everything starts and it's um it's

147
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:52,000
widely overlooked and it's widely I

148
00:05:48,579 --> 00:05:54,250
think misunderstood in this industry so

149
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,430
most industries you look at people when

150
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:59,228
they're evaluating something and they're

151
00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:02,319
looking at maybe making a big purchase

152
00:05:59,228 --> 00:06:03,849
or changing something in their in our

153
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,199
factory they physically know the

154
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:07,540
terminology and they know the metrics

155
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,149
that they're using what I've found in

156
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:11,860
this industry is that lighting is

157
00:06:09,149 --> 00:06:13,599
largely misunderstood and largely

158
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:16,449
unknown and so people have been making

159
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:19,450
purchase decisions cultivation decisions

160
00:06:16,449 --> 00:06:22,360
but without really understanding the key

161
00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:24,129
requirements and so education is a large

162
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,350
part of what we do and I'll kind of go

163
00:06:24,129 --> 00:06:28,509
over maybe about five key terms that I

164
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:30,040
think it's if some growers could

165
00:06:28,509 --> 00:06:32,168
understand these five things it'll not

166
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:34,140
only make them you know better in the

167
00:06:32,168 --> 00:06:36,310
garden but then when it comes time to

168
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:37,839
actually making a purchase decision you

169
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:40,180
know they it can be an educated one so

170
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:42,659
the first one I'll start off with is

171
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:44,709
called par PA are it's an acronym for

172
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:46,900
photosynthetically active radiation and

173
00:06:44,709 --> 00:06:48,668
that really defines the spectrum of

174
00:06:46,899 --> 00:06:51,038
light that plant to use for

175
00:06:48,668 --> 00:06:53,709
photosynthesis from 400 to 700

176
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:56,288
nanometers so if you look at light light

177
00:06:53,709 --> 00:06:58,149
is electromagnetic radiation it's

178
00:06:56,288 --> 00:07:02,319
everything from gamma rays to radio

179
00:06:58,149 --> 00:07:04,899
waves and par is a very narrow band kind

180
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:07,240
of kind of in the middle it also aligns

181
00:07:04,899 --> 00:07:09,189
with the visual spectrum so plants and

182
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:11,530
humans both use the same spectrum of

183
00:07:09,189 --> 00:07:14,139
light and use a completely different

184
00:07:11,529 --> 00:07:16,659
than plants and we actually perceive it

185
00:07:14,139 --> 00:07:18,538
differently so where our eyes or you

186
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:23,560
know really skewed towards the green

187
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:25,719
portion of the spectrum plants use 400

188
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,910
to 700 nanometers almost equally but but

189
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:30,550
differently and so when you're when

190
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:33,400
you're looking at light the quality of

191
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:35,829
light really has an impact on plant

192
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:37,839
growth in development so you know par is

193
00:07:35,829 --> 00:07:40,180
a type of spectrum so I'm sure you know

194
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:43,299
a lot of people refer to spectrum and

195
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:45,220
spectrum absolutely has an impact on you

196
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:48,728
know plant growth and development so

197
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:50,710
whether something is heavy in red heavy

198
00:07:48,728 --> 00:07:53,589
and blue heavy in green have been orange

199
00:07:50,709 --> 00:07:55,269
whether it includes UV or far red it

200
00:07:53,589 --> 00:07:58,569
allows really have an impact on plant

201
00:07:55,269 --> 00:08:00,399
growth and development so that's par

202
00:07:58,569 --> 00:08:02,439
that's the that's the quality of light

203
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:04,779
that you're looking at and then you have

204
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:08,889
the the intensity of light and that's

205
00:08:04,779 --> 00:08:11,978
defined as PPF another acronym stands

206
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:14,860
for photosynthetic photon flux and that

207
00:08:11,978 --> 00:08:16,899
is the amount of light within the PAR

208
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:19,538
region that is emitted by a light

209
00:08:16,899 --> 00:08:22,079
fixture so the total amount of photons

210
00:08:19,538 --> 00:08:24,430
that are emitted between 400 nanometers

211
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:27,939
that will give you the the PPF of a

212
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:30,879
light fixture then then the next step

213
00:08:27,939 --> 00:08:32,370
there is to add the the density to that

214
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,509
so you get ppfd

215
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:36,190
and that's going to help a bro or really

216
00:08:34,509 --> 00:08:38,528
know how much intensity is being

217
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:40,959
delivered to their crop so that's um

218
00:08:38,528 --> 00:08:42,969
that's measured in microns per square

219
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:45,609
meter per second and that's going to

220
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:47,470
tell you the light intensity at any

221
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:48,700
given point in time in your crop and you

222
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:51,610
can measure that with a quantum sensor

223
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,990
you can also get lighting designs we

224
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:53,750
provide lighting design federal gives

225
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:56,139
growers

226
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:58,610
of what they're going to be receiving

227
00:08:56,139 --> 00:09:01,069
the other the other measurement that's

228
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:04,460
important is wattage and I know that's a

229
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:06,440
that's a pretty sticky topic that we'll

230
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,820
probably get into later but you know

231
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:11,030
what it is really the measurement of

232
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:14,210
electricity input it's how much power a

233
00:09:11,029 --> 00:09:17,839
light fixture is consuming measured in

234
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:19,160
watts a one Joule per second so you know

235
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:22,430
wattage doesn't tell you anything about

236
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:23,899
how how powerful or how high-performing

237
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:26,120
a fixture is in terms of light output

238
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:27,379
really it's just a matter of you know

239
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,909
what is your electric bill going to be

240
00:09:27,379 --> 00:09:30,740
at the end of the day how many amps are

241
00:09:28,909 --> 00:09:32,629
you going to be consuming for a light

242
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:34,509
fixture so it's definitely a critical

243
00:09:32,629 --> 00:09:36,980
requirement in knowing from that regard

244
00:09:34,509 --> 00:09:38,960
but in terms of plant growth it's not

245
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:41,450
going to tell you anything and then the

246
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:44,570
final one is efficacy that's measured in

247
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:46,160
Michael Moore for jewel and and I use

248
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:47,390
the analogy of miles per gallon you know

249
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:50,360
it's really going to tell you how how

250
00:09:47,389 --> 00:09:52,189
efficient a fixture is so if you're

251
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:54,980
trying to determine what the difference

252
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:56,270
is between you know a two lighting

253
00:09:54,980 --> 00:10:00,170
systems from different manufacturers

254
00:09:56,269 --> 00:10:01,579
that maybe both consume 500 watts but

255
00:10:00,169 --> 00:10:02,629
they have different claims you really

256
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,980
want to look at the efficacy of that

257
00:10:02,629 --> 00:10:06,070
fixture and understand you know how

258
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:10,009
efficient is that fixture at converting

259
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:11,870
electrons into photons so just so I'd

260
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:16,299
make sure I understand all these terms

261
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:18,769
correctly myself yeah when we talk about

262
00:10:16,299 --> 00:10:21,259
ppfd you're talking about light

263
00:10:18,769 --> 00:10:22,819
intensity so how much photons and the

264
00:10:21,259 --> 00:10:24,980
density of those photons or Haiti are

265
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:28,790
going to be actually hitting your canopy

266
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:30,800
or your your plant down below and when

267
00:10:28,789 --> 00:10:32,480
the correct when you talk about par

268
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:35,059
you're looking at spectrum like when I

269
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:38,300
walk into a hydro shop and see you know

270
00:10:35,059 --> 00:10:40,039
a [ __ ] deluxe bulb or an analog bulb on

271
00:10:38,299 --> 00:10:41,120
the shelf and they have those charts on

272
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:44,088
the back with the red and the green

273
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:48,080
spikes that's your power level in terms

274
00:10:44,089 --> 00:10:51,080
of the spectrum that you're getting am I

275
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:52,820
saying yeah to degree you are you have

276
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:54,710
you have ppfd down now when it comes to

277
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:57,410
par in spectrum it gets it gets a little

278
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:59,600
more complicated because within par you

279
00:10:57,409 --> 00:11:02,779
can have different allocation of the

280
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:05,269
percentage of light you can have for

281
00:11:02,779 --> 00:11:07,370
example a grower could have a thousand

282
00:11:05,269 --> 00:11:09,500
ppfd

283
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:12,230
on one section of their canopy and they

284
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:13,720
can have a thousand ppfd on another but

285
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:15,980
they can have two completely different

286
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:18,529
spectrums of lights so maybe one is

287
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:21,769
influenced in this a broad spectrum it's

288
00:11:18,529 --> 00:11:22,850
more of a white light for the eye and

289
00:11:21,769 --> 00:11:24,319
then another one could be kind of that

290
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:26,480
magenta color that I think is more

291
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,820
typical of what people think of one I

292
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,560
think about 80 fixtures so the the the

293
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:33,830
light intensity the ppfd could be the

294
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:35,029
same but how how that's being generated

295
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:36,980
in terms of the spectrum could be

296
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:40,579
completely different so one might be 80%

297
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:41,899
red and 20% blue and then that's going

298
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:43,370
to have an impact on the plane

299
00:11:41,899 --> 00:11:45,730
development in terms of the allocation

300
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:48,889
of the spectrum looking that intensity

301
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:50,269
okay that makes sense and then watch

302
00:11:48,889 --> 00:11:52,220
just like you said how much electricity

303
00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:54,980
you're using it doesn't really tell you

304
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:56,690
how efficient that light is so what part

305
00:11:54,980 --> 00:12:00,500
of that process is I understand it is

306
00:11:56,690 --> 00:12:03,680
your ballast is going to be generating

307
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:05,840
some level of heat or putting off energy

308
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:09,500
and other forms other than photons which

309
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:12,230
is really not what we want in most cases

310
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:14,269
as I understand it so that the more

311
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:16,009
efficient light is the more of that

312
00:12:14,269 --> 00:12:21,379
electricity is being translated directly

313
00:12:16,009 --> 00:12:23,960
into photons is that correct yeah that's

314
00:12:21,379 --> 00:12:27,379
correct I mean in a perfect world you

315
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:29,060
would have one electron coming coming

316
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:32,750
out of the wall off of the grid and

317
00:12:29,059 --> 00:12:33,349
being transferred and converted into one

318
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:36,440
Photon

319
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:38,779
right the one the quantum of electricity

320
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:41,660
one the quantum of light but you know

321
00:12:38,779 --> 00:12:43,069
that would be impossible to do so you're

322
00:12:41,659 --> 00:12:45,949
going to have efficiency losses along

323
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:48,260
the way in those efficiency losses take

324
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:50,780
shape and all kinds of manners right

325
00:12:48,259 --> 00:12:53,240
some some efficiencies are lost in heat

326
00:12:50,779 --> 00:12:55,939
through thermal management some losses

327
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:57,230
are on the on the circuit board and then

328
00:12:55,940 --> 00:13:00,440
you have a matter of you know how a

329
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:02,659
fixture is designed to cool itself and

330
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:05,150
some fixtures have active cooling

331
00:13:02,659 --> 00:13:07,100
systems with fans and those fans require

332
00:13:05,149 --> 00:13:09,620
electricity to run right so you're going

333
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:11,750
to have you're going to have efficiency

334
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:13,970
losses there so at the end the day when

335
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:15,860
you're looking at efficiency the goal is

336
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:18,340
to have as as high of efficiency as

337
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:20,450
possible so that you can reduce the loss

338
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,970
and then like that makes me think

339
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:23,009
another

340
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:26,060
doctor would then be how uniform those

341
00:13:23,009 --> 00:13:31,050
photons are being sent to create a

342
00:13:26,059 --> 00:13:33,809
canopy or a stamp down below the light

343
00:13:31,049 --> 00:13:35,338
fixture itself I was gonna say

344
00:13:33,809 --> 00:13:37,378
unfortunate as a podcast so I don't have

345
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:40,949
any visuals you know when you start

346
00:13:37,379 --> 00:13:42,990
talking about uniformity a visual is

347
00:13:40,948 --> 00:13:44,878
really helpful for people to see what

348
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:46,980
that would look like but you're

349
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:50,100
absolutely right I mean and this comes

350
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:52,379
back to why I think horticultural

351
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:54,449
lighting has such a bad reputation and

352
00:13:52,379 --> 00:13:56,159
that you can you can see how complicated

353
00:13:54,448 --> 00:13:58,349
this all can get and then you can see

354
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:02,639
how you can really play with numbers and

355
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:04,350
play with things to to trick customers

356
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,240
or consumers into thinking they're

357
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:10,230
getting something that they're actually

358
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:12,778
not where if you took a really small

359
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:18,930
bright light fixture over you know let's

360
00:14:12,778 --> 00:14:21,318
say a four by four and you were able to

361
00:14:18,929 --> 00:14:23,489
get you know let's say a thousand ppfd

362
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:25,528
well you're going to be targeting that

363
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:28,589
over say one square foot right in the

364
00:14:25,528 --> 00:14:29,909
middle but your average across the the

365
00:14:28,589 --> 00:14:31,379
canopy is going to be the same as if you

366
00:14:29,909 --> 00:14:33,509
distributed that light nice and uniform

367
00:14:31,379 --> 00:14:35,220
and we all know a nice uniform canopy

368
00:14:33,509 --> 00:14:37,379
it's going to UM it's going to produce

369
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:40,709
better results for for a lot of

370
00:14:37,379 --> 00:14:42,778
different reason could you give a little

371
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:45,208
bit of a history in terms of sort of

372
00:14:42,778 --> 00:14:47,578
where lighting is where it started and

373
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:49,438
sort of where we are now in terms of

374
00:14:47,578 --> 00:14:55,948
these different technologies like metal

375
00:14:49,438 --> 00:14:58,610
halides CMH LED HPS yeah yeah and you

376
00:14:55,948 --> 00:15:00,719
know the history of lighting for growing

377
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:04,558
relatively corresponds to the history of

378
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:06,389
lighting in general so if you kind of

379
00:15:04,558 --> 00:15:07,980
look back at the history of lighting I

380
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:09,688
think in a larger time scale it's

381
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:12,449
relatively new technology I mean

382
00:15:09,688 --> 00:15:15,328
incandescent light was really formed

383
00:15:12,448 --> 00:15:17,008
around the early 1900s that's and what's

384
00:15:15,328 --> 00:15:18,599
scary is if you look at that you know I

385
00:15:17,009 --> 00:15:20,068
remember growing up it was the same

386
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,899
light bulbs that that we used in our

387
00:15:20,068 --> 00:15:24,808
house until you know pretty recently

388
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:27,480
that's gonna really inefficient

389
00:15:24,808 --> 00:15:29,909
technology and then you move to

390
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:31,649
fluorescent lighting which is still very

391
00:15:29,909 --> 00:15:33,299
much used in the in the growing industry

392
00:15:31,649 --> 00:15:35,629
today and that was developed in the

393
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:35,629
1930s

394
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:42,269
again the undies were all developed for

395
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:45,270
industrial applications high pressure

396
00:15:42,269 --> 00:15:48,029
sodium in the 70s and 80s and that was

397
00:15:45,269 --> 00:15:51,360
designed for street lamps mineral halide

398
00:15:48,029 --> 00:15:54,179
in the 60s same thing automotives

399
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,860
streets industrial uses obviously

400
00:15:54,179 --> 00:15:57,719
different spectrum each PS you know has

401
00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:00,710
that orange glow to it metal halide has

402
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:03,420
that that crisp cool white look to it

403
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:05,670
and then LEDs started to come around in

404
00:16:03,419 --> 00:16:08,669
the in the 60s as well in the visible

405
00:16:05,669 --> 00:16:12,870
spectrum as semiconductors at large

406
00:16:08,669 --> 00:16:14,779
started to proliferate and and become

407
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:17,460
more integrated in computers and so

408
00:16:14,779 --> 00:16:20,879
along that way I think if you look at

409
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:23,310
the history of of lighting in in

410
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:25,169
agriculture you know I think we all have

411
00:16:23,309 --> 00:16:27,689
to give obtunded credit to the cannabis

412
00:16:25,169 --> 00:16:33,360
industry where for for helping advance

413
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:37,260
that and and really help set some of the

414
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:40,680
the operating procedures and and what

415
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:42,029
what what we're using today we're given

416
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:44,939
the legislation of cannabis and how

417
00:16:42,029 --> 00:16:47,100
growers weren't able to you know plow a

418
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:49,140
field and put it out in the open they

419
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:51,090
weren't they weren't able to you know

420
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:54,029
build a greenhouse that everybody could

421
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:56,550
see they were forced into warehouses

422
00:16:54,029 --> 00:16:58,589
they were forced into garages and in

423
00:16:56,549 --> 00:17:02,189
closets and well there's no sunlight

424
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:05,150
there right so you had to rely on social

425
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:08,150
source lighting and high pressure sodium

426
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:10,380
was a great technology for that it was

427
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:12,990
extremely bright extremely high

428
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:16,170
performance the efficacy the energy

429
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:18,959
efficiency was phenomenal at the time

430
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:20,640
you know fluorescent fixtures were below

431
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,890
1 micromolar per Joule and then all of a

432
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,620
sudden high pressure sodium was getting

433
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:28,170
up to 1.7 in fact high pressure sodium

434
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:29,759
was the most energy-efficient highest

435
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:32,430
efficacy lighting system until just a

436
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:35,690
few years ago everybody thinks that LEDs

437
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:38,519
are just intrinsically energy efficient

438
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:40,380
and obviously over the last few years

439
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:42,450
we've made tons of advancements and so

440
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:45,150
it's not even really close anymore but

441
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:47,309
that's been a very recent development so

442
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:48,570
you can kind of track the history of

443
00:17:47,309 --> 00:17:50,819
general lighting too

444
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:52,980
the history of groaning and one of the

445
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:54,329
one of the things that you know most

446
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,559
people kind of ask well what's the

447
00:17:54,329 --> 00:17:57,000
difference between and grow light and

448
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:59,250
I'm a regular light that you would use

449
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,319
in your house and until recently with

450
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:04,500
with LEDs the answer was nothing right

451
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:07,439
people would take the same HPS lamp that

452
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:10,230
was used in a street lamp or a parking

453
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,240
garage they'd put it in a in a warehouse

454
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:15,269
I mean can grow plants with it

455
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:17,880
LEDs now give us the flexibility to

456
00:18:15,269 --> 00:18:21,150
design custom custom light intensities

457
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:23,490
custom spectrum for plant growth and so

458
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:26,220
it's no longer taking something that was

459
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:28,559
built for a highway and then having to

460
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:30,569
tailor all of your other procedures

461
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:32,039
around that light to make it ideal you

462
00:18:30,569 --> 00:18:35,970
know changing your irrigation your

463
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:37,950
fertigation nutrient schedule optimizing

464
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:39,960
your HVAC around something that was

465
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:42,240
never designed specifically for our

466
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:44,579
plans and now we can take light and

467
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,799
specifically design it for a plant and

468
00:18:44,579 --> 00:18:49,799
so it's no longer kind of that limiting

469
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:53,460
threshold when I was first starting to

470
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:57,269
grow I the sin of the industry standard

471
00:18:53,460 --> 00:19:00,329
was metal halide for veg and HPS for

472
00:18:57,269 --> 00:19:03,539
flower and then these so-called new

473
00:19:00,329 --> 00:19:05,250
technologies would show up like Ellie

474
00:19:03,539 --> 00:19:07,200
sees is something I'm seeing a lot of

475
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:10,349
these days that people are recommending

476
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:13,740
are using and double-ended fixtures with

477
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:15,119
HP S is a relatively new idea as well

478
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:17,240
can you just touch a little bit on what

479
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:19,109
some of the differences are between

480
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:24,000
between these and a little bit more

481
00:19:19,109 --> 00:19:26,159
detail for listeners yeah so LEC is a

482
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,119
marketing term that ceramic metal halide

483
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:32,130
companies used as LED started to become

484
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:34,739
a little bit more popular which i think

485
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:38,310
is you know from their perspective kind

486
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:40,440
of smart right so you had LEDs coming

487
00:19:38,309 --> 00:19:43,799
online which everybody associated LEDs

488
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:45,000
with new and I tech and innovative a lot

489
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:46,769
of other people associate them with a

490
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,839
lot of other words right as well in

491
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:51,329
terms of underperforming high costs all

492
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:53,220
of that but at the end of the day LED

493
00:19:51,329 --> 00:19:56,339
was associated with something kind of

494
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:58,650
new and cutting-edge and so to associate

495
00:19:56,339 --> 00:19:59,699
certain McMinn halide with the same you

496
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:02,340
know they just started coming out with

497
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:03,419
LEC so the

498
00:20:02,339 --> 00:20:08,009
that's kind of where you get that name

499
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:09,720
from and then double-ended HPS from from

500
00:20:08,009 --> 00:20:11,099
a growing perspective the the advantage

501
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:14,190
there is really all around energy

502
00:20:11,099 --> 00:20:16,339
efficiency and higher performance you

503
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:19,230
know so you're moving from single ended

504
00:20:16,339 --> 00:20:21,599
to double ended where it changed the

505
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:23,400
cultivation technique quite a bit when

506
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:26,069
you start to increase efficiencies and

507
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:29,580
you're able to get higher light output

508
00:20:26,069 --> 00:20:31,079
you went from hoods where the single

509
00:20:29,579 --> 00:20:32,699
ended might have been much closer to the

510
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:36,178
canopy to get a higher light intensity

511
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:37,590
so you had air-cooled hoods and then you

512
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:40,919
were able to move the double ended up

513
00:20:37,589 --> 00:20:42,959
higher than the ceiling you could remove

514
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:45,509
some of the different HVAC requirements

515
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:48,480
so it did change it changed the

516
00:20:45,509 --> 00:20:50,069
landscape quite a bit when they

517
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,169
introduced double ended and then when

518
00:20:50,069 --> 00:20:54,720
you look at you know why why growers

519
00:20:52,169 --> 00:20:57,960
were typically using metal halide for

520
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:02,100
veg and HPS for bloom you know that was

521
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:04,079
based on I think I'm not gonna call it

522
00:21:02,099 --> 00:21:05,730
rudimentary research but research at the

523
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:09,298
time that was really looking at spectrum

524
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:11,339
and so there was a lot of people at the

525
00:21:09,298 --> 00:21:14,509
time associated you know more blue

526
00:21:11,339 --> 00:21:17,308
content a little more compact plants and

527
00:21:14,509 --> 00:21:19,470
metal halide has more blue content than

528
00:21:17,308 --> 00:21:21,178
HPS and then more red and far red

529
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:22,440
content with flower development and so

530
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:26,038
that's where you started to see the use

531
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:28,500
of those two now with with more research

532
00:21:26,038 --> 00:21:30,690
and and the ability to fine tune

533
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:33,808
spectrum with all these I mean down to

534
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:36,000
the nanometer we can do research that

535
00:21:33,808 --> 00:21:38,639
we've never been able to do before to

536
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,319
really look at you know is how truthful

537
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,659
is it that that do we makes a more

538
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:45,359
compact plant and we've done research

539
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:48,510
before where we've actually grown

540
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:51,319
cannabis under various spectral light

541
00:21:48,509 --> 00:21:54,089
and I think we ran one that was about

542
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:57,058
five different samples of different

543
00:21:54,089 --> 00:22:00,148
spectra of light and the plant that

544
00:21:57,058 --> 00:22:02,428
actually was veg that was the had the

545
00:22:00,148 --> 00:22:04,319
longest internode spacing it stretched

546
00:22:02,429 --> 00:22:06,899
the most was the plant that was actually

547
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:08,009
grown under blue light and so then you

548
00:22:06,898 --> 00:22:11,069
have to start to look at his entourage

549
00:22:08,009 --> 00:22:14,308
aspect of spectrum and how how does blue

550
00:22:11,069 --> 00:22:15,839
light integrate with the other spectrum

551
00:22:14,308 --> 00:22:17,339
of light to get what we see

552
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:18,928
a more compact plan so it's not just

553
00:22:17,339 --> 00:22:21,480
what we think of as more blue light

554
00:22:18,929 --> 00:22:23,220
because you take blue light and isolate

555
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:26,099
it and it does the opposite of what you

556
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:29,159
think you would do so is sunlight still

557
00:22:26,099 --> 00:22:31,949
the king in this arena I hear everyone

558
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:35,100
say that nothing beats the Sun and I

559
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:36,690
could see where if we're taking lighting

560
00:22:35,099 --> 00:22:38,490
technologies that are not designed for

561
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:40,679
agriculture for growing plants and just

562
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:43,710
using them to grow plants that might be

563
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:45,269
the case but without getting you know

564
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:47,850
too far into different spectrums

565
00:22:45,269 --> 00:22:50,788
how does sunlight compare because I know

566
00:22:47,849 --> 00:22:53,369
your light for example is a white light

567
00:22:50,788 --> 00:22:55,500
you know CMH or LEC since they're the

568
00:22:53,369 --> 00:22:58,678
same thing they're they're more of a

569
00:22:55,500 --> 00:23:03,390
white light as well is that sort of full

570
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:05,548
spectrum or you know rather than going

571
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:08,640
with these you know more orange red

572
00:23:05,548 --> 00:23:10,079
colors or blue green or purple like the

573
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:14,009
magenta color you mentioned with with

574
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:18,389
LEDs what's the what's the comparison

575
00:23:14,009 --> 00:23:21,329
between all of this I guess I will try

576
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:22,799
to be succinct in answering this so if I

577
00:23:21,329 --> 00:23:25,349
go too long to stop me because it's a

578
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:27,269
fascinating topic and I think this is

579
00:23:25,349 --> 00:23:28,939
really where you start talking about

580
00:23:27,269 --> 00:23:32,220
spectrum and optimization

581
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:35,730
we're just getting started not only just

582
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:36,899
you know we fluence we as a species are

583
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:38,940
just getting started to really

584
00:23:36,898 --> 00:23:41,548
understand how plants use light and how

585
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:43,288
we can use light as a tool to elicit

586
00:23:41,548 --> 00:23:45,269
certain responses out of plants and so

587
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:50,429
you know to answer your question is the

588
00:23:45,269 --> 00:23:52,288
Sun still King I don't know you at the

589
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:54,330
end of the day we've had customers that

590
00:23:52,288 --> 00:23:56,069
have traditionally grown crops outdoors

591
00:23:54,329 --> 00:23:58,139
or in a greenhouse using sunlight

592
00:23:56,069 --> 00:23:59,609
they've moved to our systems and they

593
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:03,538
say it's the most flavorful crop they've

594
00:23:59,609 --> 00:24:06,109
ever grown what the Sun does is you know

595
00:24:03,538 --> 00:24:08,339
it provides everything right it provides

596
00:24:06,109 --> 00:24:10,740
every spectrum of light that a plant

597
00:24:08,339 --> 00:24:12,298
could want some of it is good and some

598
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:15,140
of it is harmful you know when you start

599
00:24:12,298 --> 00:24:17,398
looking at ultraviolet light for example

600
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:20,159
ultraviolet has some very compelling

601
00:24:17,398 --> 00:24:21,959
tendencies to elicit positive responses

602
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,850
and plans but it can also be very

603
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,620
damaging it's a stressor and stresses

604
00:24:23,849 --> 00:24:27,418
the plant and so if you're stressing a

605
00:24:25,619 --> 00:24:29,308
plant at a time when you want to be

606
00:24:27,419 --> 00:24:30,509
maximizing its growth

607
00:24:29,308 --> 00:24:32,308
that's going to be a negative response

608
00:24:30,509 --> 00:24:35,220
that you're going to want to avoid after

609
00:24:32,308 --> 00:24:37,349
providing for red light at the at the

610
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:38,548
wrong time the crops development cycle

611
00:24:37,349 --> 00:24:40,528
again it could be it could be

612
00:24:38,548 --> 00:24:42,509
detrimental so I think what we really

613
00:24:40,528 --> 00:24:44,099
need to do is take you know take the

614
00:24:42,509 --> 00:24:45,329
grower and say what are your goals you

615
00:24:44,099 --> 00:24:47,998
know what are you trying to accomplish

616
00:24:45,329 --> 00:24:49,408
with this crop and then take light and

617
00:24:47,999 --> 00:24:51,450
use that as a tool to help them

618
00:24:49,409 --> 00:24:54,629
accomplish it it's it's not a

619
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:56,759
one-size-fits-all approach it's we're

620
00:24:54,628 --> 00:24:59,189
working with universities and we ran

621
00:24:56,759 --> 00:25:01,190
research with the University of

622
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:03,600
Tennessee looking at phytonutrients and

623
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:06,210
looking at different compounds and how

624
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:07,558
can we how can we take these critical

625
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:11,909
compounds that can be used in

626
00:25:07,558 --> 00:25:15,599
pharmacology that that natively can only

627
00:25:11,909 --> 00:25:17,039
be you know maybe 0.3% of of a crop and

628
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:20,009
I think the crop earlier study was bill

629
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:22,499
looking at a compound for to help people

630
00:25:20,009 --> 00:25:24,599
with vision and it natively was you know

631
00:25:22,499 --> 00:25:26,460
very small doses plant but how could we

632
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:28,528
use widen so we looked at various social

633
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:31,048
source spectrum going from really

634
00:25:28,528 --> 00:25:34,528
looking at the difference between 400

635
00:25:31,048 --> 00:25:36,960
nanometers and 405 nanometers and 420

636
00:25:34,528 --> 00:25:41,339
nanometers I mean the differences

637
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:43,829
between these are are in comprehensively

638
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:46,288
small but when you look at the results

639
00:25:43,829 --> 00:25:47,939
of what that does to a plant and how

640
00:25:46,288 --> 00:25:50,368
that affects the chemical compositions

641
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:51,960
of these plants it's quite dramatic the

642
00:25:50,368 --> 00:25:55,308
most interesting thing that we saw was

643
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:57,509
that you can you can use light to

644
00:25:55,308 --> 00:25:58,999
increase the chemical composition of the

645
00:25:57,509 --> 00:26:00,868
plant target those specific

646
00:25:58,999 --> 00:26:04,860
photoreceptors that are responsible for

647
00:26:00,868 --> 00:26:06,868
that development and increase increase

648
00:26:04,859 --> 00:26:09,388
the percentage of that compound but it

649
00:26:06,868 --> 00:26:12,240
came at a cost of yield so the plants

650
00:26:09,388 --> 00:26:13,528
biomass overall was lower in so that's

651
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,569
that's where I come back and I have to

652
00:26:13,528 --> 00:26:18,118
say what is your goal as a grower all

653
00:26:15,569 --> 00:26:21,089
right maybe we can use light to increase

654
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:23,069
THC content or CBD content but is that

655
00:26:21,089 --> 00:26:25,079
gonna come at a cost of overall yield

656
00:26:23,069 --> 00:26:26,668
and as companies are moving more towards

657
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:28,259
extracts and they're starting to isolate

658
00:26:26,669 --> 00:26:30,210
these compounds and identify really what

659
00:26:28,259 --> 00:26:34,618
they're targeting the answer might be

660
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:35,788
yes or no so again very early stages I

661
00:26:34,618 --> 00:26:37,709
think the most fascinating thing is

662
00:26:35,788 --> 00:26:40,109
right now we're creating these tools

663
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:42,000
that are going to give researchers the

664
00:26:40,109 --> 00:26:43,199
ability to conduct research that they've

665
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,450
never been able to do

666
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:48,569
were in fact when I joined fluence 30

667
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:49,950
years ago we still had a lot of research

668
00:26:48,569 --> 00:26:52,548
partners in academia that we're using

669
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:55,250
theatrical stage lighting filters over

670
00:26:52,548 --> 00:26:58,950
HPS to conduct this type of research

671
00:26:55,250 --> 00:27:01,038
which is not exactly as precise as you

672
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:03,750
would like it to be

673
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:06,778
Wow so I've always been a soil person

674
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:11,038
and I've always turned to soil as a way

675
00:27:06,778 --> 00:27:13,440
of improving or affecting you know

676
00:27:11,038 --> 00:27:16,528
terpene expression the odors and flavors

677
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:20,220
of my crop through manipulating minerals

678
00:27:16,528 --> 00:27:21,990
or the biological aspects of a soil but

679
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:23,970
as I understand it and from seeing some

680
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:26,970
of your research at photo X and other

681
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:28,980
places essentially lighting spectrum and

682
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:32,850
lighting intensity can have an effect as

683
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:36,298
well on how a plant expresses not just

684
00:27:32,849 --> 00:27:39,168
its growth but also it's it's different

685
00:27:36,298 --> 00:27:41,158
phytonutrients as well is that correct

686
00:27:39,169 --> 00:27:44,700
that's absolutely correct and I might

687
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:45,840
let the other Travis chime in here too

688
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,399
you know I'll just kind of tee it up

689
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:50,250
with with you look at the role of

690
00:27:47,398 --> 00:27:54,000
lighting in plants it's there's really

691
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:56,099
two main aspects that that light impacts

692
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,929
that it's ones in growth and one is in

693
00:27:56,099 --> 00:27:59,788
development and if you kind of take a

694
00:27:57,929 --> 00:28:01,490
step back and say what is what is light

695
00:27:59,788 --> 00:28:04,109
you know what are we talking about here

696
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:06,269
light has a duality nature to it it's

697
00:28:04,109 --> 00:28:08,638
really two things it's an energy and

698
00:28:06,269 --> 00:28:10,349
it's a particle and so if you look at

699
00:28:08,638 --> 00:28:12,119
the energy of the plan and its impact

700
00:28:10,349 --> 00:28:13,589
that it has on growth that's that's

701
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:15,178
really where intensity comes into play

702
00:28:13,589 --> 00:28:16,109
so then if you look at the particle and

703
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:18,809
that's really going to be the wavelength

704
00:28:16,109 --> 00:28:22,048
of light that goes back to the spectrum

705
00:28:18,808 --> 00:28:24,678
of light plants have hundreds of

706
00:28:22,048 --> 00:28:26,638
photoreceptors a lot of them are unknown

707
00:28:24,679 --> 00:28:28,409
and those photoreceptors are all

708
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:30,388
responsible for different things within

709
00:28:28,409 --> 00:28:32,730
that plant so you might have a

710
00:28:30,388 --> 00:28:37,740
photoreceptor that's that's designed to

711
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:39,298
take in say 460 nanometers 370

712
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:40,888
nanometers whatever that might be

713
00:28:39,298 --> 00:28:42,778
and then that's going to trigger that

714
00:28:40,888 --> 00:28:45,178
plant to do something particular with

715
00:28:42,778 --> 00:28:47,308
that with that wavelength of light we

716
00:28:45,179 --> 00:28:49,470
we've been fascinated with chlorophyll

717
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:50,970
you know if you look at chlorophyll a

718
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:52,950
and B all right those are probably the

719
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:55,019
two most popular pigments and

720
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:57,659
photoreceptors of a plan they're largely

721
00:28:55,019 --> 00:28:59,548
responsible for photosynthesis

722
00:28:57,659 --> 00:29:01,259
and they both align with red and blue

723
00:28:59,548 --> 00:29:03,720
wavelengths of light so that's where you

724
00:29:01,259 --> 00:29:06,149
see this uprising of magenta and pink

725
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:07,500
lighting the problem is we need when you

726
00:29:06,148 --> 00:29:09,479
solely isolate those photoreceptors

727
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:11,659
you're neglecting hundreds of other

728
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:16,470
photoreceptors that are responsible for

729
00:29:11,659 --> 00:29:20,039
nutrition flavor structural development

730
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:21,569
so going back to your question you know

731
00:29:20,038 --> 00:29:23,548
looking at an intern odo spacing of a

732
00:29:21,569 --> 00:29:25,259
plant and everything else you can you

733
00:29:23,548 --> 00:29:27,898
can absolutely optimize that with light

734
00:29:25,259 --> 00:29:29,548
and it's pretty fascinating so it's kind

735
00:29:27,898 --> 00:29:31,378
of like you know you're a soil guy right

736
00:29:29,548 --> 00:29:33,388
until you're asking is the Sun the best

737
00:29:31,378 --> 00:29:34,740
source of light it's kind of like

738
00:29:33,388 --> 00:29:36,418
looking at soils like well if you went

739
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:38,278
out and you know dug a hole and some

740
00:29:36,419 --> 00:29:39,600
really rich fertile ground even if it

741
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:41,849
wasn't say in Salinas Valley or

742
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:43,678
something is that going to be the best

743
00:29:41,849 --> 00:29:47,719
soil for a plant or could you optimize

744
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:47,720
it in a way to get a better response

745
00:29:48,589 --> 00:29:54,569
yeah so one of the things about the Sun

746
00:29:51,298 --> 00:29:57,450
as I understand it is over the course of

747
00:29:54,569 --> 00:30:00,089
the summer the the Sun spectrum changes

748
00:29:57,450 --> 00:30:03,840
slightly and people have made the

749
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:05,878
argument that plants a plant for example

750
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:08,638
like look if we're talking cannabis in

751
00:30:05,878 --> 00:30:10,798
this case it may be you know half a post

752
00:30:08,638 --> 00:30:13,888
solstice solstice as it starts to flower

753
00:30:10,798 --> 00:30:16,048
and that lighting spectrum I believe is

754
00:30:13,888 --> 00:30:20,158
in the Sun is going towards more of a

755
00:30:16,048 --> 00:30:22,440
red spectrum that because the cannabis

756
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:25,620
plant or you know all annual flowering

757
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:27,450
plants would be used to this slight slow

758
00:30:25,619 --> 00:30:30,239
change in spectrum that the sunlight

759
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:32,538
gives that's our baseline for optimal

760
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:36,628
and then they try and recreate this with

761
00:30:32,538 --> 00:30:38,220
lighting technology is there any is

762
00:30:36,628 --> 00:30:42,658
there any foundation or research to

763
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:44,690
support any of that that's if I can come

764
00:30:42,659 --> 00:30:47,309
in now yeah that's a good question um

765
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:48,990
yeah it's it's interesting cuz you can

766
00:30:47,308 --> 00:30:50,878
you know you can track the plant back to

767
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:53,388
its native habitat right try to draw

768
00:30:50,878 --> 00:30:55,949
conclusions based on where it originated

769
00:30:53,388 --> 00:30:58,109
to try to figure out how best to make it

770
00:30:55,950 --> 00:31:00,808
flower do whatever you you know if you

771
00:30:58,109 --> 00:31:01,979
would like it to do but at the end of

772
00:31:00,808 --> 00:31:03,658
the day you know there's that there

773
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:05,579
there's other environmental factors

774
00:31:03,659 --> 00:31:11,190
obviously at play aside from just light

775
00:31:05,579 --> 00:31:14,138
so for some annual crops you can Trump

776
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:16,690
the photoperiod response for flowering

777
00:31:14,138 --> 00:31:19,928
with temperature right so for example

778
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:21,909
like with um with garden mums they're

779
00:31:19,929 --> 00:31:23,889
also a short-day crop similar to

780
00:31:21,909 --> 00:31:26,739
cannabis so they flower under short days

781
00:31:23,888 --> 00:31:28,358
and you welcome under long days but

782
00:31:26,739 --> 00:31:30,909
let's say that you're growing them in a

783
00:31:28,358 --> 00:31:32,769
late summer and the days start to

784
00:31:30,909 --> 00:31:34,600
shorten and you would think flower

785
00:31:32,769 --> 00:31:37,358
initiation would go on but you have a

786
00:31:34,599 --> 00:31:39,579
very hot late summer that heat will

787
00:31:37,358 --> 00:31:41,769
delay your flowering no matter to light

788
00:31:39,579 --> 00:31:43,839
quality no matter the duration of the

789
00:31:41,769 --> 00:31:47,528
day the temperature is automatically

790
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:50,558
trumped your hour initiation the same

791
00:31:47,528 --> 00:31:54,099
can go in relation to light intensity

792
00:31:50,558 --> 00:31:55,450
and photo period so when a short day no

793
00:31:54,099 --> 00:31:57,969
matter the spectrum is supposed to

794
00:31:55,450 --> 00:32:01,090
trigger flowering if you have excessive

795
00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:02,829
light levels but a short day the light

796
00:32:01,089 --> 00:32:05,589
level could trump the response you're

797
00:32:02,829 --> 00:32:07,749
looking for from a short day so I think

798
00:32:05,589 --> 00:32:09,128
there's there's so many other ways to

799
00:32:07,749 --> 00:32:11,200
come at it they're just taking

800
00:32:09,128 --> 00:32:13,230
assumptions perhaps on where it's native

801
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,700
to that makes sense

802
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:18,009
yeah and that brought up a couple other

803
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:19,419
questions so one I just want to

804
00:32:18,009 --> 00:32:21,190
highlight when you say photo period

805
00:32:19,419 --> 00:32:22,450
that's a new term that we haven't talked

806
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:23,950
about yet you're talking about the

807
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:26,970
amount of the amount of time that the

808
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:29,139
plant is receiving light is that correct

809
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:30,819
exactly so I'll compliment on what

810
00:32:29,138 --> 00:32:32,469
Travis said on some of the basic terms

811
00:32:30,819 --> 00:32:34,538
and so when you think about light he

812
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:37,239
mentions you have three things to think

813
00:32:34,538 --> 00:32:39,849
about you have duration like quality the

814
00:32:37,239 --> 00:32:42,190
spectrum and then intensity so when

815
00:32:39,849 --> 00:32:43,808
we're talking about duration this is the

816
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:45,820
amount of time that the light is

817
00:32:43,808 --> 00:32:47,079
actually in contact with the plant right

818
00:32:45,819 --> 00:32:48,700
so the amount of time the plan is

819
00:32:47,079 --> 00:32:53,230
exposed to the light is a term called

820
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:55,450
photo period and photo period is key in

821
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:56,858
multiple physiological processes but one

822
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:58,960
of the main ones specifically for

823
00:32:56,858 --> 00:33:02,319
cannabis obviously is vegetative growth

824
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:03,340
of bulking branching and then flowering

825
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:06,089
growth so yes

826
00:33:03,339 --> 00:33:08,648
photo period is just duration of light I

827
00:33:06,089 --> 00:33:10,689
brought up a couple other questions that

828
00:33:08,648 --> 00:33:13,538
I've had for years and wanting to know

829
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:16,389
the answer to so what is optimal in

830
00:33:13,538 --> 00:33:17,829
terms of vegetative growth

831
00:33:16,388 --> 00:33:19,898
I hear people some people say that

832
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:21,069
plants need a dark cycle I hear other

833
00:33:19,898 --> 00:33:23,069
people and I read an article recently

834
00:33:21,069 --> 00:33:26,220
that showed the benefits

835
00:33:23,069 --> 00:33:29,039
24-hour light cycle have you seen any

836
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:32,549
research on optimal levels I even saw a

837
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:34,889
really crazy 13 hour flowering charter

838
00:33:32,549 --> 00:33:36,839
14 hour I can't remember correctly that

839
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:38,960
someone set up or where Lighting's going

840
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:42,539
on for two hours and off for an hour

841
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:44,490
always of supposedly maximizing the

842
00:33:42,539 --> 00:33:45,899
amount of light that the plant can take

843
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:49,650
in over a given

844
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:51,750
I think it's D Li daily lighting or

845
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:53,100
what's the term exactly for the amount

846
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:56,099
of light a plant can take up over a

847
00:33:53,099 --> 00:33:59,099
given period of time

848
00:33:56,099 --> 00:34:00,959
sure it's called a D Li so a daily light

849
00:33:59,099 --> 00:34:02,849
integral and so this is the amount of

850
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:06,990
light accumulated during a 24 hour

851
00:34:02,849 --> 00:34:09,150
period and so to go to your question is

852
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:12,599
there a specific sweet spot for let's

853
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:16,050
say vegetative growth I would say there

854
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:18,360
there's not yet you can optimize your

855
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:21,000
environment to be working 24 hours a day

856
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:22,559
but it's not just due to the photo

857
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,809
period and it's not just due to light

858
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:28,460
quality and light intensity all of these

859
00:34:24,809 --> 00:34:32,190
other environmental factors such as co2

860
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:34,980
humidity soil and root temperature leaf

861
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:38,400
temperature air flow you know

862
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:39,869
transpiration ready nutrients all of

863
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:43,730
these all of these are going to fall

864
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:46,079
into play in combination or even

865
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:49,199
complimenting your light levels in your

866
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:51,480
photo period so the fun thing I see

867
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:53,129
coming from a greenhouse background now

868
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:55,320
that we're able to focus in on

869
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:57,660
controlled environments we have the

870
00:34:55,320 --> 00:35:00,240
ability to have precision over every

871
00:34:57,659 --> 00:35:03,210
single environmental factor and with

872
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:06,269
that we're going to find multiple ways

873
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:08,010
to achieve the same thing because like I

874
00:35:06,269 --> 00:35:10,050
said with flowering temperature can

875
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:13,590
manipulate flowering sometimes just as

876
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:15,950
much as photo period so I think there's

877
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:19,590
many different ways to go about it

878
00:35:15,949 --> 00:35:24,480
but in regard to just basic flowering

879
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:27,180
physiology a long day for cannabis does

880
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:29,219
help with bulking getting you that that

881
00:35:27,179 --> 00:35:32,099
carbohydrate buildup in order to you

882
00:35:29,219 --> 00:35:35,339
know burst out flowers once it's started

883
00:35:32,099 --> 00:35:36,599
flat our initiation under short days so

884
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:37,019
but I think that's something not only

885
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:38,250
can

886
00:35:37,019 --> 00:35:40,320
an abyss but also controlled

887
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:42,510
environments with you know flowering

888
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,039
crops vegetables we're gonna find

889
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:46,290
multiple ways with all of these

890
00:35:44,039 --> 00:35:51,389
environmental attributes to get to

891
00:35:46,289 --> 00:35:53,789
similar goals in sad if I could chime in

892
00:35:51,389 --> 00:35:58,409
on this too because I think what Travis

893
00:35:53,789 --> 00:36:00,690
is hitting on is you know kind of we're

894
00:35:58,409 --> 00:36:02,549
hitting we're moving into this kind of

895
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:04,019
new world of crop production with

896
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:05,730
controlled environment agriculture and

897
00:36:04,019 --> 00:36:07,550
you can look at things from a business

898
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:10,199
standpoint from a commercial standpoint

899
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:12,570
and you look at all the different ways

900
00:36:10,199 --> 00:36:14,429
that you can do something so you know

901
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:16,860
whether you're using temperature to

902
00:36:14,429 --> 00:36:19,739
control stem elongation or you're using

903
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:21,840
light you know you really want to look

904
00:36:19,739 --> 00:36:23,909
at what's the most economical way to do

905
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:26,039
that which one is going to have the

906
00:36:23,909 --> 00:36:29,460
lowest operating cost if they must have

907
00:36:26,039 --> 00:36:31,259
come both accomplish the same thing and

908
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:33,240
if you look at if you look at lighting

909
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:36,420
and you were talking about you know the

910
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:39,119
period of darkness and the spectrum of

911
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:41,010
light that's where we're we're currently

912
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:46,469
underway with a lot of research looking

913
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:48,150
at can you achieve a DLI that is as far

914
00:36:46,469 --> 00:36:51,149
as we know say optimal for cannabis they

915
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:53,849
say you can achieve a 35 DOI for

916
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:57,150
cannabis if you could achieve that in a

917
00:36:53,849 --> 00:37:02,159
eight-hour period versus a 12-hour

918
00:36:57,150 --> 00:37:04,139
period could you then have a longer dark

919
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:05,339
cycle where maybe your HVAC isn't

920
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:08,369
running as hard or maybe you're using

921
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:10,440
peak grid energy less so you're paying

922
00:37:08,369 --> 00:37:13,349
less for that energy while you're still

923
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:15,450
accomplishing the same yield that you

924
00:37:13,349 --> 00:37:16,739
would otherwise and I think that's where

925
00:37:15,449 --> 00:37:18,029
things are going to be fascinating from

926
00:37:16,739 --> 00:37:20,039
a business perspective least our copter

927
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:22,530
optimized operations and look at how we

928
00:37:20,039 --> 00:37:25,380
can use these these techniques and then

929
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:26,519
when it comes to spectrum as well

930
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:28,260
you know there's a lot of research

931
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:30,150
looking at the phytochrome photo

932
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:31,680
equilibrium and the read too far read

933
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:33,930
ratio and what impact that has on

934
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:36,210
flowering can you trick a plant because

935
00:37:33,929 --> 00:37:39,149
the the photo period isn't actually

936
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:40,530
controlled by the amount of day that the

937
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:42,660
plant receives it's controlled by the

938
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:44,760
amount of darkness that ever sees it so

939
00:37:42,659 --> 00:37:47,969
can you actually you know maybe run your

940
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:49,500
lights and flower for 18 hours and trick

941
00:37:47,969 --> 00:37:50,359
your plant into thinking that it had

942
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,340
that

943
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:54,590
night cycle so that you can maximize

944
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:56,570
yield I think that's where things will

945
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:58,850
get quite fascinating

946
00:37:56,570 --> 00:38:04,160
now you guys presented some far-red

947
00:37:58,849 --> 00:38:06,230
research last year at the conference can

948
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:08,599
you just touch a little bit on how some

949
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:10,789
of these lighting you know more unique

950
00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:13,309
lighting spectrums that are more

951
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:15,340
specialized and some of the effects that

952
00:38:13,309 --> 00:38:17,690
they're those are having on plant growth

953
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:19,280
hmm Travis I don't know if you have

954
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:20,570
anything that you'd want to talk about

955
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:24,110
I'm trying to think of anything that I

956
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:27,559
could that I could share right now well

957
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:30,769
I I will say that before I worked with

958
00:38:27,559 --> 00:38:32,539
fluence or started working at fluence I

959
00:38:30,769 --> 00:38:35,000
worked with them on a project using

960
00:38:32,539 --> 00:38:37,550
different different read too far read

961
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:41,780
ratios for flowering of multiple you

962
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:43,820
know perennial generous and what what we

963
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:47,900
did learn is that you know as Travis

964
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:49,370
State each plant has you know within

965
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:51,050
within the understanding of how plants

966
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:53,989
take in light they have something called

967
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:56,269
a photo equilibrium and cytochrome and

968
00:38:53,989 --> 00:38:59,419
all these photoreceptors and so certain

969
00:38:56,269 --> 00:39:00,650
photo receptors you know perceive a lot

970
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:02,990
of these wavelengths that trigger

971
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:05,900
flowering or trigger certain growth

972
00:39:02,989 --> 00:39:07,639
attributes that we're looking for and so

973
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:09,950
if I could just say anything on it is

974
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:13,489
you know the more precise we get on some

975
00:39:09,949 --> 00:39:15,139
of these Sol you know I guess you could

976
00:39:13,489 --> 00:39:17,269
just say pigments that were applying on

977
00:39:15,139 --> 00:39:19,579
the plants we're going to have just

978
00:39:17,269 --> 00:39:21,500
precise growth attributes that we'll be

979
00:39:19,579 --> 00:39:23,299
able to trigger during different

980
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:25,699
different stages of production if

981
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:27,530
anything we're learning that and also in

982
00:39:25,699 --> 00:39:30,439
regard to let's say you know leafy

983
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:32,570
greens and herbs and we could learn from

984
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:35,809
this industry but they're they're using

985
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:38,019
you know different different like

986
00:39:35,809 --> 00:39:41,179
quality so let's say red or blue light

987
00:39:38,019 --> 00:39:43,820
towards the end of production to enhance

988
00:39:41,179 --> 00:39:46,879
certain phytonutrients or even using UV

989
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:48,830
like we stated before to provoke certain

990
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:51,230
compounds that are desirable but you

991
00:39:48,829 --> 00:39:53,509
don't grow with that spectrum the whole

992
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:56,570
time during production you just apply it

993
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:59,810
for a two-hour period every day for the

994
00:39:56,570 --> 00:40:01,070
last week of production so I know that I

995
00:39:59,809 --> 00:40:04,130
know our research team is working on

996
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:05,840
some things in that regard but you know

997
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:08,390
all these industries are linked so one

998
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:10,039
thing we learn they're all plants how

999
00:40:08,389 --> 00:40:13,699
can they how can we bring it all

1000
00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:16,219
together at the end so you know although

1001
00:40:13,699 --> 00:40:19,250
bond that with what's specific to

1002
00:40:16,219 --> 00:40:22,159
cannabis I think exactly what what

1003
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:24,409
Travis descended with is we can learn a

1004
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:27,199
lot from different crops and apply those

1005
00:40:24,409 --> 00:40:30,489
same techniques across the across the

1006
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:32,809
different species and but even within

1007
00:40:30,489 --> 00:40:37,279
within the same family so if you look at

1008
00:40:32,809 --> 00:40:39,559
cannabis we're an AUV trial with three

1009
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:42,620
different strains of cannabis and each

1010
00:40:39,559 --> 00:40:45,500
one reacted differently one we were able

1011
00:40:42,619 --> 00:40:48,139
to increase the THC content with with UV

1012
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:49,849
light one it didn't really seem to have

1013
00:40:48,139 --> 00:40:54,019
an impact and one it had a detrimental

1014
00:40:49,849 --> 00:40:56,210
impact and so from you know going back

1015
00:40:54,019 --> 00:40:59,090
from a marketing perspective right now

1016
00:40:56,210 --> 00:41:01,940
fluid sells UV light but you will not

1017
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:04,880
see us advertising these is like a THC

1018
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:06,980
booster or anything like that because it

1019
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:09,200
depends on your genetics it also depends

1020
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:11,719
on how you use that light and so we

1021
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:13,969
still have so much to learn before we

1022
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:15,859
can start to advise on how to use some

1023
00:41:13,969 --> 00:41:19,099
of these tailored tailored spectra to a

1024
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:20,329
list of those specific results so

1025
00:41:19,099 --> 00:41:24,219
essentially what I'm getting from this

1026
00:41:20,329 --> 00:41:28,309
is that these really specific spectrums

1027
00:41:24,219 --> 00:41:30,439
can have a have an impact or a fairly

1028
00:41:28,309 --> 00:41:33,170
dramatic impact on the health and growth

1029
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:35,510
of a plant but the research just hasn't

1030
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:40,610
been established enough to really make

1031
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:42,320
any broad assertions about about that

1032
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:45,860
sort of thing at this point does that

1033
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:47,390
sound right it does it doesn't if you

1034
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:48,920
think about how some of these studies

1035
00:41:47,389 --> 00:41:51,079
are conducted whether they're you know

1036
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:53,059
with with certain lighting vendors or

1037
00:41:51,079 --> 00:41:54,829
they're with the university let's say

1038
00:41:53,059 --> 00:41:56,659
that you have you know you have a study

1039
00:41:54,829 --> 00:41:59,779
underway in your trialing a certain

1040
00:41:56,659 --> 00:42:01,639
spectrum with the same variety but you

1041
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:03,320
have other set points like I said before

1042
00:42:01,639 --> 00:42:04,849
of these other environmental factors

1043
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:08,150
that in a commercial setting could be

1044
00:42:04,849 --> 00:42:09,860
completely different so even though you

1045
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:11,389
learn something from the study in regard

1046
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:13,430
to the light spectrum you also need a

1047
00:42:11,389 --> 00:42:14,750
trial different conditions in regard to

1048
00:42:13,429 --> 00:42:16,909
all of these other environmental

1049
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:18,519
conditions to make sure that it could be

1050
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:20,449
a consistent result

1051
00:42:18,519 --> 00:42:22,309
yeah they're so they're just basically

1052
00:42:20,449 --> 00:42:23,929
hasn't been enough replication of any of

1053
00:42:22,309 --> 00:42:25,519
these studies to really draw any good

1054
00:42:23,929 --> 00:42:28,269
conclusions because like you mentioned

1055
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:31,789
there's so many variables involved that

1056
00:42:28,269 --> 00:42:33,500
it's just really hard to know how how it

1057
00:42:31,789 --> 00:42:34,849
will go or how plants will respond under

1058
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:36,409
slightly different environmental

1059
00:42:34,849 --> 00:42:41,659
conditions other than just the lighting

1060
00:42:36,409 --> 00:42:45,170
spectrum yep yep and I think I think

1061
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:47,000
something that that benefits growers is

1062
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:49,300
to have you know in the horticulture

1063
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,679
space what is called grower trials and

1064
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:54,289
this is where let's say a grower would

1065
00:42:51,679 --> 00:42:56,809
work with us and we could set up a trial

1066
00:42:54,289 --> 00:42:59,210
specific to their environment their

1067
00:42:56,809 --> 00:43:00,889
needs and then be able to let's say

1068
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:02,809
recommend something specifically for

1069
00:43:00,889 --> 00:43:03,679
their goal because everyone else is

1070
00:43:02,809 --> 00:43:05,929
going to have a completely different

1071
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:08,719
environment and now that we can tweak

1072
00:43:05,929 --> 00:43:10,239
every single one of these factors that

1073
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:12,439
how you truly optimize

1074
00:43:10,239 --> 00:43:13,789
that's really cool I love that you guys

1075
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:15,530
are doing that because I think that's

1076
00:43:13,789 --> 00:43:17,659
really what's lacking right now in this

1077
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:20,890
industry is we're seeing a lot of claims

1078
00:43:17,659 --> 00:43:23,869
but not a lot of people doing controlled

1079
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:25,699
research - they can we can actually

1080
00:43:23,869 --> 00:43:27,190
start drawing conclusions from so I'm

1081
00:43:25,699 --> 00:43:30,799
glad that you guys are adding to that

1082
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:33,380
overall body of knowledge that's great

1083
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:35,090
one thing you brought up that I wanted

1084
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:39,860
to it kind of brought up a question and

1085
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:43,309
me was as you know plant stress is is

1086
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:45,200
not necessarily always a bad thing you

1087
00:43:43,309 --> 00:43:47,420
know you'll have that grower who always

1088
00:43:45,199 --> 00:43:50,779
had the crop that got neglected or got

1089
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:53,380
pests or something happened and it ends

1090
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:57,230
up being their highest highest highest

1091
00:43:53,380 --> 00:44:00,860
yielding and or you know highest THC

1092
00:43:57,230 --> 00:44:03,500
crop that they've grown and I know in

1093
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:05,690
Italy I read a really cool article about

1094
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:08,030
how the farmers would flood their tomato

1095
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:09,800
fields with salt water at a certain

1096
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:13,180
period during that plant's growth as a

1097
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:15,530
way of stressing the plant creating a

1098
00:44:13,179 --> 00:44:18,529
you know forcing it to put its energy

1099
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:21,730
into its fruiting and so that tomato had

1100
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:24,620
you know better flavor in it for example

1101
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:27,980
have you seen any ways or research

1102
00:44:24,619 --> 00:44:30,469
around lighting and plant stress in in

1103
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:31,400
terms of optimization or ways that we

1104
00:44:30,469 --> 00:44:35,568
can maybe util

1105
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:39,980
is lighting as a way of improving you

1106
00:44:35,568 --> 00:44:41,690
know bud quality or our flowers I'll

1107
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:43,759
speak a little to this because I did

1108
00:44:41,690 --> 00:44:47,420
work work with you know plant stress in

1109
00:44:43,759 --> 00:44:48,858
general for part of my thesis but it's

1110
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:52,159
interesting you know in regard to

1111
00:44:48,858 --> 00:44:54,858
flowering or fruiting you know when a

1112
00:44:52,159 --> 00:44:56,538
plant is under stress it's going to take

1113
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:58,429
whatever energy it has and just

1114
00:44:56,539 --> 00:45:00,049
reproduce you know it's kind of like the

1115
00:44:58,429 --> 00:45:01,940
last resort if it's going to die it

1116
00:45:00,048 --> 00:45:04,068
might as well just reproduce right so

1117
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:06,409
you can induce flowering through stress

1118
00:45:04,068 --> 00:45:10,579
and stress yes can be through lighting

1119
00:45:06,409 --> 00:45:12,230
and be you know either from I would

1120
00:45:10,579 --> 00:45:13,849
believe like quality and also light

1121
00:45:12,230 --> 00:45:16,068
intensity combined you could have

1122
00:45:13,849 --> 00:45:19,670
different stressors there but you can

1123
00:45:16,068 --> 00:45:22,038
also have you know certain responses

1124
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:25,700
that also have different advantages to

1125
00:45:22,039 --> 00:45:29,710
them so like if you were to give a plant

1126
00:45:25,699 --> 00:45:33,710
let's just say an exposure of a harsh UV

1127
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:35,420
wavelengths you could produce a certain

1128
00:45:33,710 --> 00:45:37,460
compound in the plant that attract

1129
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:39,710
attracts predator insects and I know

1130
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:41,559
there's been work done at Kansas State

1131
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:44,199
Marquardt to this or that you give a

1132
00:45:41,559 --> 00:45:47,210
certain dose or high-intensity light

1133
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:49,818
pulse and you can provoke certain

1134
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:52,608
compounds in the root zone to be

1135
00:45:49,818 --> 00:45:55,429
resistant to pathogen you know entrance

1136
00:45:52,608 --> 00:45:57,170
into the soil so I don't know

1137
00:45:55,429 --> 00:45:58,848
specifically and Travis you may be able

1138
00:45:57,170 --> 00:46:02,720
to speak to this better than me but I

1139
00:45:58,849 --> 00:46:08,630
think plant stress has a place it's just

1140
00:46:02,719 --> 00:46:09,798
on how how do we approach it yeah Travis

1141
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:13,309
did you want to add anything else to

1142
00:46:09,798 --> 00:46:14,538
that other Travis no I think I just

1143
00:46:13,309 --> 00:46:16,309
figured that self of what I was saying

1144
00:46:14,539 --> 00:46:17,989
around around UV light in that

1145
00:46:16,309 --> 00:46:20,720
absolutely you can use light as a

1146
00:46:17,989 --> 00:46:23,630
stressor and like you said stress has

1147
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:26,209
its place in terms of benefits for crops

1148
00:46:23,630 --> 00:46:29,269
it's just really when it comes to

1149
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:31,099
lighting we don't know and we can't

1150
00:46:29,268 --> 00:46:35,838
prescribe when that optimal time will be

1151
00:46:31,099 --> 00:46:37,278
so you know do we want to use it maybe

1152
00:46:35,838 --> 00:46:39,048
say during the Scotto period at night

1153
00:46:37,278 --> 00:46:41,449
and then watch the plant with some UV

1154
00:46:39,048 --> 00:46:43,818
light or do we want to do it during the

1155
00:46:41,449 --> 00:46:45,139
main flowering stage those are all the

1156
00:46:43,818 --> 00:46:47,449
research projects that

1157
00:46:45,139 --> 00:46:50,960
to take place and it's genetics specific

1158
00:46:47,449 --> 00:46:52,939
its environment specific we've ran more

1159
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,710
trials than I can count where

1160
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:57,528
unfortunately the data comes back

1161
00:46:54,710 --> 00:47:00,048
inconclusive because we will be running

1162
00:46:57,528 --> 00:47:02,449
say a UV trial to determine if we can

1163
00:47:00,048 --> 00:47:05,719
use UV light to you know increase the

1164
00:47:02,449 --> 00:47:07,608
quality of cannabis and then halfway

1165
00:47:05,719 --> 00:47:09,980
through the study you know the grower

1166
00:47:07,608 --> 00:47:12,318
will have an HVAC problem and so for

1167
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:15,170
three days of that cycle their

1168
00:47:12,318 --> 00:47:18,079
temperature or their or their diff or

1169
00:47:15,170 --> 00:47:19,338
their RH is is completely out of sync

1170
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:22,190
and so the results come back and you say

1171
00:47:19,338 --> 00:47:24,440
well are those results accurate or was

1172
00:47:22,190 --> 00:47:27,309
that a result of different environmental

1173
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:29,420
conditions and you know get cannabis

1174
00:47:27,309 --> 00:47:31,849
flowering alone is you know a couple

1175
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:34,579
months and then you have to add in the

1176
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:38,059
time to cure the plant test the plant

1177
00:47:34,579 --> 00:47:39,470
and so each of these trials takes a few

1178
00:47:38,059 --> 00:47:41,869
months it takes about three or four

1179
00:47:39,469 --> 00:47:46,759
months and so if one you have one thing

1180
00:47:41,869 --> 00:47:48,410
to go out of step which typically do in

1181
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:50,089
a commercial growing environment you

1182
00:47:48,409 --> 00:47:52,278
have to start all over so unfortunately

1183
00:47:50,088 --> 00:47:56,119
the the research process takes takes

1184
00:47:52,278 --> 00:47:58,909
quite a while yeah I'm excited though to

1185
00:47:56,119 --> 00:48:00,829
see where where this all takes us in

1186
00:47:58,909 --> 00:48:02,328
terms of plant stress because you are

1187
00:48:00,829 --> 00:48:03,170
opening up the door to for more

1188
00:48:02,329 --> 00:48:06,380
pathogens

1189
00:48:03,170 --> 00:48:09,380
poor poor growth or potentially less

1190
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:10,818
yield depending on like other Travis

1191
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:13,039
mentioned the types of stress or the

1192
00:48:10,818 --> 00:48:14,778
amount of stress it's it's like you're

1193
00:48:13,039 --> 00:48:16,549
towing this thin line that you don't

1194
00:48:14,778 --> 00:48:19,009
really know what's gonna set it off

1195
00:48:16,548 --> 00:48:21,079
either one way or another but I've never

1196
00:48:19,009 --> 00:48:24,440
heard of being able to give lighting

1197
00:48:21,079 --> 00:48:26,450
spectrum and actually affect the ability

1198
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:28,789
of a plant to attract certain insects or

1199
00:48:26,449 --> 00:48:30,259
repel other pathogens I would I would

1200
00:48:28,789 --> 00:48:33,859
love to learn more about that well guys

1201
00:48:30,259 --> 00:48:35,929
learn more yeah and you know you hear me

1202
00:48:33,858 --> 00:48:37,068
talk about this it reminds me of you

1203
00:48:35,929 --> 00:48:39,679
know I'm not just looking at it as a

1204
00:48:37,068 --> 00:48:41,329
stressor but as a beneficiary outside of

1205
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:43,338
outside of plant growth or development

1206
00:48:41,329 --> 00:48:44,450
we did a trial at the University of

1207
00:48:43,338 --> 00:48:46,518
Florida

1208
00:48:44,449 --> 00:48:50,028
basil downy mildew is probably the

1209
00:48:46,518 --> 00:48:53,899
number one issue with basil crop growers

1210
00:48:50,028 --> 00:48:55,639
and go use different techniques to help

1211
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:58,579
prevent it and and keep it at bay

1212
00:48:55,639 --> 00:49:00,559
I think sulphur is is one of the most

1213
00:48:58,579 --> 00:49:02,170
prominent but we actually looked at

1214
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:06,460
using different spectra of light and

1215
00:49:02,170 --> 00:49:09,139
concluded that we can use specific red

1216
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:11,000
wavelength of light to suppress basal

1217
00:49:09,139 --> 00:49:13,009
down you know that and so when you start

1218
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:15,289
looking at using light outside of just a

1219
00:49:13,010 --> 00:49:17,330
tool for photosynthesis or photo

1220
00:49:15,289 --> 00:49:20,599
morphogenesis we start looking at as a

1221
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:22,460
part of your your IPM strategy then you

1222
00:49:20,599 --> 00:49:26,329
start to you know can start to look at

1223
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:27,530
using light in a multitude of ways are

1224
00:49:26,329 --> 00:49:29,569
you guys working with anyone that's

1225
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:31,640
using it right now for suppression of

1226
00:49:29,570 --> 00:49:36,320
powdery mildew or botrytis with cannabis

1227
00:49:31,639 --> 00:49:38,480
I know I did prior work for Kim

1228
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:41,330
influenced using blue light in reference

1229
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:43,820
to making fungus sports for tea late so

1230
00:49:41,329 --> 00:49:46,549
in certain cases some some spectrums

1231
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:49,010
actually enhance you know spore spore

1232
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:50,720
count in certain fungi which is which is

1233
00:49:49,010 --> 00:49:54,050
not a good thing and then also we did

1234
00:49:50,719 --> 00:49:56,509
work on using UVC to kill botrytis on

1235
00:49:54,050 --> 00:49:59,570
contact with certain Harmon goes is just

1236
00:49:56,510 --> 00:50:01,850
pulses but I think that research if

1237
00:49:59,570 --> 00:50:03,700
anything it's it's just now really

1238
00:50:01,849 --> 00:50:06,949
starting to be part of the conversation

1239
00:50:03,699 --> 00:50:08,480
market cultivation okay okay that's

1240
00:50:06,949 --> 00:50:09,799
really exciting I can't wait to hear

1241
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:13,309
what you guys come up with in the next

1242
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:15,200
few years so that's great I wanted to

1243
00:50:13,309 --> 00:50:17,059
get back to some of these questions I

1244
00:50:15,199 --> 00:50:19,279
had I'd written out before our talk that

1245
00:50:17,059 --> 00:50:23,059
we're sort of sort of basic but really

1246
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:25,460
captured some of my questions from back

1247
00:50:23,059 --> 00:50:27,799
in the day and one of them was that I

1248
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:30,079
always thought that LEDs in general were

1249
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:34,360
too expensive and they seemed to produce

1250
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:37,130
poor yields and I noticed more and more

1251
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:38,960
improvements in the LED you know

1252
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:40,730
lighting arena and that technology I

1253
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:43,789
know when it first came out I always

1254
00:50:40,730 --> 00:50:45,650
said it was it just wasn't there yet do

1255
00:50:43,789 --> 00:50:47,449
you guys feel like we're there yet it

1256
00:50:45,650 --> 00:50:49,730
seems like we are can you just talk a

1257
00:50:47,449 --> 00:50:53,509
little bit about where we're at with

1258
00:50:49,730 --> 00:50:59,059
LEDs yeah so you're right they were too

1259
00:50:53,510 --> 00:51:01,430
expensive they didn't perform and you

1260
00:50:59,059 --> 00:51:05,929
know unfortunately it's created this

1261
00:51:01,429 --> 00:51:09,879
this negative impression for LED

1262
00:51:05,929 --> 00:51:12,559
technology in the horticulture space and

1263
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:15,530
I mentioned you know or

1264
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:18,380
not talking about my background I joined

1265
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:20,930
fluence I left a fortune 500 company

1266
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:23,930
where being in the marketing department

1267
00:51:20,929 --> 00:51:25,399
at a fortune 500 company it doesn't

1268
00:51:23,929 --> 00:51:27,500
matter who your bosses or what your

1269
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:30,079
title was you reported to the legal team

1270
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:31,760
you know everything that you that you

1271
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:33,920
put on paper everything that you said

1272
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:36,200
had to be run through legal and if there

1273
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:38,780
was even one iota of some kind of claim

1274
00:51:36,199 --> 00:51:42,009
it had to be substantiated and proven

1275
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:44,450
right so that we don't get sued in the

1276
00:51:42,010 --> 00:51:46,790
in the horticulture and lighting space

1277
00:51:44,449 --> 00:51:48,589
there was nothing there was none of that

1278
00:51:46,789 --> 00:51:50,420
I joined and I did a competitive

1279
00:51:48,590 --> 00:51:52,190
analysis and I was appalled at the

1280
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:53,900
claims that these other lighting

1281
00:51:52,190 --> 00:51:56,750
companies were making that were

1282
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:58,099
completely unsubstantiated now they we

1283
00:51:56,750 --> 00:51:59,809
have competitors that would just

1284
00:51:58,099 --> 00:52:01,909
literally put like guaranteed higher

1285
00:51:59,809 --> 00:52:04,549
yields and it's like okay well

1286
00:52:01,909 --> 00:52:05,960
guaranteed or what and if you give your

1287
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:07,280
light to somebody that doesn't know the

1288
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:10,400
first thing about growing how are you

1289
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:12,530
going to guarantee that our yield you

1290
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:14,539
know everybody I think was the the

1291
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:16,880
highest performing LED or the highest

1292
00:52:14,539 --> 00:52:19,130
performing light everybody would you

1293
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:20,420
know you'd have a 300 watt LED system

1294
00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:22,930
that would outperform a thousand watt

1295
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:27,139
HPS and it was just it was appalling

1296
00:52:22,929 --> 00:52:28,969
then I told my boss Nick the CEO of the

1297
00:52:27,139 --> 00:52:30,199
company will never do that you know

1298
00:52:28,969 --> 00:52:32,869
we'll never do that we have to build

1299
00:52:30,199 --> 00:52:35,239
credibility let's take a different

1300
00:52:32,869 --> 00:52:38,179
approach and so it's been it's been an

1301
00:52:35,239 --> 00:52:41,469
uphill battle kind of going against the

1302
00:52:38,179 --> 00:52:44,569
headwind that led manufacturers created

1303
00:52:41,469 --> 00:52:47,329
probably going back to maybe five five

1304
00:52:44,570 --> 00:52:49,309
years ago or so where they would come in

1305
00:52:47,329 --> 00:52:51,699
and they would the technology was not

1306
00:52:49,309 --> 00:52:53,869
there the LEDs themselves were not

1307
00:52:51,699 --> 00:52:57,019
efficient enough they weren't powerful

1308
00:52:53,869 --> 00:52:58,609
enough the packages and then the people

1309
00:52:57,019 --> 00:53:01,820
that were building these quote-unquote

1310
00:52:58,610 --> 00:53:04,039
grow lights they a lot of them did not

1311
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:06,800
know the ins and outs of horticulture

1312
00:53:04,039 --> 00:53:10,059
and so nowhere on their labels would you

1313
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:12,410
see the PPF would you see the efficacy

1314
00:53:10,059 --> 00:53:14,599
would you see par maps that would show

1315
00:53:12,409 --> 00:53:16,670
you the light uniformity that they were

1316
00:53:14,599 --> 00:53:19,610
getting until you had buyers that were

1317
00:53:16,670 --> 00:53:21,710
buying things based off of claims and

1318
00:53:19,610 --> 00:53:25,700
hearsay in marketing that was that was

1319
00:53:21,710 --> 00:53:26,480
false I think the industry has become

1320
00:53:25,699 --> 00:53:29,599
much more

1321
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:32,719
educated people are you know lighting is

1322
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:34,639
continuing to evolve the commercial

1323
00:53:32,719 --> 00:53:38,419
horticulture industry is continuing to

1324
00:53:34,639 --> 00:53:41,480
evolve and so you're seeing I think more

1325
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:43,550
respectful horticultural lighting

1326
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:45,440
companies come out that are trying to do

1327
00:53:43,550 --> 00:53:48,470
things the right way and at the same

1328
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:51,230
time the growing community is becoming

1329
00:53:48,469 --> 00:53:53,899
more educated which is only putting

1330
00:53:51,230 --> 00:53:55,880
pressure on on lighting companies to to

1331
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:57,740
adapt to that and you're starting to see

1332
00:53:55,880 --> 00:54:01,160
more standards being being implemented

1333
00:53:57,739 --> 00:54:03,250
the the DLC the design light consortium

1334
00:54:01,159 --> 00:54:05,529
who typically have helped to build

1335
00:54:03,250 --> 00:54:07,880
standards and regulations in the

1336
00:54:05,530 --> 00:54:11,869
industrial space so that when you go to

1337
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:14,420
buy a light for your home that you can

1338
00:54:11,869 --> 00:54:16,579
look on that box and it has all of the

1339
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:18,608
critical specifications listed so you

1340
00:54:16,579 --> 00:54:20,869
know what you're buying they're now

1341
00:54:18,608 --> 00:54:21,590
working in the horticulture space and

1342
00:54:20,869 --> 00:54:25,070
they'll be coming out with a

1343
00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:26,809
specification that will help bring you

1344
00:54:25,070 --> 00:54:28,460
know more clarity to the growing

1345
00:54:26,809 --> 00:54:30,699
community so you'll have these standards

1346
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:34,039
and in the lighting companies need to

1347
00:54:30,699 --> 00:54:36,500
start playing by the rules and it's not

1348
00:54:34,039 --> 00:54:38,090
going to be perfect when it starts you

1349
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:41,150
know they're still going back to how

1350
00:54:38,090 --> 00:54:42,710
much is unknown it's there there will be

1351
00:54:41,150 --> 00:54:45,470
standards put in place that may hinder

1352
00:54:42,710 --> 00:54:47,480
growth if you kind of look at the pace

1353
00:54:45,469 --> 00:54:49,549
of innovation in the automotive or the

1354
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:51,550
aerospace industry that is slow it's an

1355
00:54:49,550 --> 00:54:53,810
it's it goes at about a snail's pace

1356
00:54:51,550 --> 00:54:55,960
because of all the regulations and

1357
00:54:53,809 --> 00:54:58,400
standards that they have to conform to

1358
00:54:55,960 --> 00:55:00,800
so on one hand it's good because you

1359
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:02,480
have a very high safety rating because

1360
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:04,280
you're not just throwing in unproven

1361
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:06,108
components on the other hand you know

1362
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:08,240
the adoption of innovation is pre-k's

1363
00:55:06,108 --> 00:55:10,639
well and so I think horticulture

1364
00:55:08,239 --> 00:55:12,319
lighting has been kind of unregulated

1365
00:55:10,639 --> 00:55:13,730
just running loose and wild and it's

1366
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:16,130
come at a detriment and the cost to the

1367
00:55:13,730 --> 00:55:18,079
growing community so getting some kind

1368
00:55:16,130 --> 00:55:20,660
of standards in place will will help us

1369
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:22,429
so I hope that answer your question in

1370
00:55:20,659 --> 00:55:24,379
terms of the history and you know about

1371
00:55:22,429 --> 00:55:26,118
why we got here and ended to answer your

1372
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:28,700
question absolutely we're here know you

1373
00:55:26,119 --> 00:55:31,789
know the the costs are continuing to go

1374
00:55:28,699 --> 00:55:33,858
down as tunnel Edie's continue to

1375
00:55:31,789 --> 00:55:37,070
proliferate in the underlying technology

1376
00:55:33,858 --> 00:55:40,329
behind them continues to proliferate and

1377
00:55:37,070 --> 00:55:43,990
then as you know companies like Bruins

1378
00:55:40,329 --> 00:55:45,579
start to become larger and we grow you

1379
00:55:43,989 --> 00:55:47,289
know the commodity of scale only helps

1380
00:55:45,579 --> 00:55:49,989
us reduce our pricing that we pass on to

1381
00:55:47,289 --> 00:55:52,630
customers and and I'd be remiss if I

1382
00:55:49,989 --> 00:55:55,269
didn't really acknowledge the the

1383
00:55:52,630 --> 00:55:58,450
cannabis industry for for fueling that

1384
00:55:55,269 --> 00:56:02,230
growth you know the food production

1385
00:55:58,449 --> 00:56:04,629
industry right now is is they don't have

1386
00:56:02,230 --> 00:56:08,289
the margins that cannabis has they don't

1387
00:56:04,630 --> 00:56:11,230
have the flexibility to take risks and

1388
00:56:08,289 --> 00:56:13,000
adopt new technology that cannabis has

1389
00:56:11,230 --> 00:56:15,460
because if they fail you know that could

1390
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,719
be bankruptcy for them whereas the

1391
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:18,490
cannabis industry you know I think

1392
00:56:16,719 --> 00:56:21,819
natively is risk takers more

1393
00:56:18,489 --> 00:56:25,659
entrepreneurs and they are helping to

1394
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:27,250
adopt new AG tech that as those as those

1395
00:56:25,659 --> 00:56:28,750
technologies are proven as those

1396
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:30,699
companies scale and grow and they're

1397
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:32,409
able to reduce their pricing then the

1398
00:56:30,699 --> 00:56:35,139
food industry can look at it and say

1399
00:56:32,409 --> 00:56:37,029
okay that seems to be proven that seems

1400
00:56:35,139 --> 00:56:38,920
to be working and oh now the pricing is

1401
00:56:37,030 --> 00:56:41,860
dropping because these technologies are

1402
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:44,559
being adopted on a more wide scale right

1403
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:46,420
which ultimately if we can help the food

1404
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:49,110
industry become more sustainable and

1405
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:51,130
more efficient everybody wins

1406
00:56:49,110 --> 00:56:53,320
yeah I agree with everything he just

1407
00:56:51,130 --> 00:56:56,110
said I think that's wonderful I will say

1408
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:59,789
that here in Washington and Oregon we're

1409
00:56:56,110 --> 00:57:02,200
seeing such a we're at a point now where

1410
00:56:59,789 --> 00:57:04,869
so much cannabis has been produced

1411
00:57:02,199 --> 00:57:06,460
relative to what's being consumed or

1412
00:57:04,869 --> 00:57:07,929
purchased that a lot of growers are

1413
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:10,900
struggling and they're having a look to

1414
00:57:07,929 --> 00:57:12,309
look at ways at improving efficiency not

1415
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:14,700
just from a lighting perspective but

1416
00:57:12,309 --> 00:57:17,019
from an overall business perspective and

1417
00:57:14,699 --> 00:57:19,779
here's where I think LEDs really shine

1418
00:57:17,019 --> 00:57:22,179
though there is still a higher cost of

1419
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:25,269
entry it appears than say a double-ended

1420
00:57:22,179 --> 00:57:28,149
HPS what's and correct me if i'm wrong

1421
00:57:25,269 --> 00:57:32,320
seems to be the closest equivalent to a

1422
00:57:28,150 --> 00:57:35,200
well-made LED light but you more than

1423
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:37,240
make that up in terms of the amount of

1424
00:57:35,199 --> 00:57:39,009
electricity and efficiency that you're

1425
00:57:37,239 --> 00:57:41,189
getting out of the LED fixture over the

1426
00:57:39,010 --> 00:57:44,080
life of that fixture is that correct

1427
00:57:41,190 --> 00:57:46,059
yeah and I will I will not hide from the

1428
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:48,519
from the price of our pictures in fact

1429
00:57:46,059 --> 00:57:50,529
you know fluence is very open about the

1430
00:57:48,519 --> 00:57:53,730
pricing we don't we don't play games we

1431
00:57:50,530 --> 00:57:53,730
have standard pricing and

1432
00:57:53,989 --> 00:57:57,699
our fixtures on day one are absolutely

1433
00:57:55,670 --> 00:58:02,329
more expensive than high pressure sodium

1434
00:57:57,699 --> 00:58:04,669
the the onus is on us as a company to

1435
00:58:02,329 --> 00:58:08,480
make sure that our customers can get a

1436
00:58:04,670 --> 00:58:10,309
quick payback on these systems so it

1437
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:12,679
cost me these are these are high-tech

1438
00:58:10,309 --> 00:58:14,210
systems right these are new technology

1439
00:58:12,679 --> 00:58:17,389
high-tech systems they cost more to

1440
00:58:14,210 --> 00:58:20,240
build the amount of people that go into

1441
00:58:17,389 --> 00:58:23,299
the research and the support behind them

1442
00:58:20,239 --> 00:58:25,549
costs more to support these and so the

1443
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:28,280
price is higher but we look at from a

1444
00:58:25,550 --> 00:58:29,990
business standpoint energy efficiency

1445
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:31,760
and lowering your utility bill are

1446
00:58:29,989 --> 00:58:35,689
absolutely you know something to look at

1447
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:38,000
and consider the maintenance cost is

1448
00:58:35,690 --> 00:58:41,230
something to consider those are all

1449
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:44,088
secondary to helping our customers

1450
00:58:41,230 --> 00:58:47,809
improve revenue you know looking at can

1451
00:58:44,088 --> 00:58:50,329
we help you increase your yield can we

1452
00:58:47,809 --> 00:58:52,329
help you increase your quality can you

1453
00:58:50,329 --> 00:58:54,858
help you maintain a better shelf-life or

1454
00:58:52,329 --> 00:58:57,380
consistency so that your forecasting is

1455
00:58:54,858 --> 00:58:59,509
better so that your your shrink is

1456
00:58:57,380 --> 00:59:02,000
reduced you have about you have less

1457
00:58:59,510 --> 00:59:04,640
loss crop loss we take in all of these

1458
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:07,039
factors and we don't tell the customer

1459
00:59:04,639 --> 00:59:08,690
hey you're going to get 10% more yield

1460
00:59:07,039 --> 00:59:10,338
you're gonna get 5% more years you're

1461
00:59:08,690 --> 00:59:11,480
didn't get 20% we we don't tell them

1462
00:59:10,338 --> 00:59:13,639
that they're going to reduce their

1463
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:15,639
shrink which hopefully Travis you can

1464
00:59:13,639 --> 00:59:18,379
you can talk about that as well from

1465
00:59:15,639 --> 00:59:20,088
this past company we don't tell them

1466
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:22,130
that what we do is we try to show them

1467
00:59:20,088 --> 00:59:23,929
that that is all possible and then we

1468
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:25,970
allow them to say you know what I think

1469
00:59:23,929 --> 00:59:28,669
you're right if I can get you know say

1470
00:59:25,969 --> 00:59:30,289
10% more light or 20% more light and I

1471
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:32,180
can get these other factors I can reduce

1472
00:59:30,289 --> 00:59:34,279
my HVAC cost they plug it in the model

1473
00:59:32,179 --> 00:59:37,639
and they do a payback analysis and and

1474
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:39,619
if we can't be efficient at providing a

1475
00:59:37,639 --> 00:59:40,909
payback within a time frame that is

1476
00:59:39,619 --> 00:59:42,650
suitable for our customers and we need

1477
00:59:40,909 --> 00:59:44,509
to go back and we need to adjust it but

1478
00:59:42,650 --> 00:59:46,519
I think if you look at the adoption of

1479
00:59:44,510 --> 00:59:47,869
fluence and the if you just look at the

1480
00:59:46,519 --> 00:59:50,630
ones in the adoption of the cannabis

1481
00:59:47,869 --> 00:59:52,099
industry both from home growers you know

1482
00:59:50,630 --> 00:59:54,320
hobbyists at home that are using one

1483
00:59:52,099 --> 00:59:56,838
light to the world's largest growers

1484
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:58,460
that are using thousands of lights it's

1485
00:59:56,838 --> 01:00:02,119
clear that it makes sense for for

1486
00:59:58,460 --> 01:00:03,710
everybody large and small yeah you know

1487
01:00:02,119 --> 01:00:05,900
it's funny I was joking around when we

1488
01:00:03,710 --> 01:00:06,929
first started this podcast and I was

1489
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:08,430
interviewing some

1490
01:00:06,929 --> 01:00:10,108
the people that I know in the canvas

1491
01:00:08,429 --> 01:00:13,108
industry that I consider to be

1492
01:00:10,108 --> 01:00:16,079
influencers like my buddy Jaya Palmer

1493
01:00:13,108 --> 01:00:19,650
David Bernard Peron uppity God

1494
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:22,079
Nelson Linsley with poetry plants and I

1495
01:00:19,650 --> 01:00:24,300
told her I'm like guys I don't want this

1496
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:26,579
to turn into affluence podcast because

1497
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:29,519
we keep talking about their name when we

1498
01:00:26,579 --> 01:00:30,869
talk about lighting just because you

1499
01:00:29,519 --> 01:00:33,059
know what you guys are doing is very

1500
01:00:30,869 --> 01:00:36,030
innovative and you are doing a lot of

1501
01:00:33,059 --> 01:00:38,639
research to support the industry and I

1502
01:00:36,030 --> 01:00:40,050
think that's that's amazing I don't want

1503
01:00:38,639 --> 01:00:41,549
it there I don't want to sound like

1504
01:00:40,050 --> 01:00:43,800
there aren't other companies lighting

1505
01:00:41,550 --> 01:00:45,539
companies out there doing good good

1506
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:47,490
things too in the industry and I think

1507
01:00:45,539 --> 01:00:49,259
that's important to highlight and I

1508
01:00:47,489 --> 01:00:52,079
think people just need to really do

1509
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:53,640
their research and you've kind of given

1510
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:57,150
us some tools here today with this

1511
01:00:53,639 --> 01:00:59,179
terminology and other other information

1512
01:00:57,150 --> 01:01:02,639
in terms of how to evaluate a light or a

1513
01:00:59,179 --> 01:01:04,500
lighting system but in your eyes what

1514
01:01:02,639 --> 01:01:08,219
what separates fluids from some of these

1515
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:12,389
other lighting companies out there I'll

1516
01:01:08,219 --> 01:01:14,098
speak to that one so when I was on the

1517
01:01:12,389 --> 01:01:17,250
other side so I guess you could consider

1518
01:01:14,099 --> 01:01:19,050
me a buyer one thing that I did really

1519
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:20,579
appreciate about fluency even though at

1520
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:23,880
the same time I was trying multiple

1521
01:01:20,579 --> 01:01:26,159
other other lighting technologies for

1522
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:27,960
one you know when it comes to a grower

1523
01:01:26,159 --> 01:01:28,799
that's making a large investment and you

1524
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:30,659
know going through all of these

1525
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:32,250
decisions and building a new new

1526
01:01:30,659 --> 01:01:34,500
controlled environment or green house or

1527
01:01:32,250 --> 01:01:37,260
whatever it may be when you have

1528
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:39,719
somebody who can help you from from the

1529
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:41,099
start not just in regard to lighting but

1530
01:01:39,719 --> 01:01:42,809
every other thing that you need to think

1531
01:01:41,099 --> 01:01:45,180
about in regard to photo biology and

1532
01:01:42,809 --> 01:01:49,108
plant physiology fluence was extremely

1533
01:01:45,179 --> 01:01:51,659
helpful and from that side of it I came

1534
01:01:49,108 --> 01:01:52,170
to respect fluence and hits why why I'm

1535
01:01:51,659 --> 01:01:54,269
here

1536
01:01:52,170 --> 01:01:56,280
as their director of cultivation support

1537
01:01:54,269 --> 01:01:58,588
now they care enough to have a whole

1538
01:01:56,280 --> 01:02:01,320
division that is meant to help the

1539
01:01:58,588 --> 01:02:03,889
grower learn how to maximize these

1540
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:06,630
technologies while at the same time

1541
01:02:03,889 --> 01:02:08,368
appreciating and also learning about all

1542
01:02:06,630 --> 01:02:11,390
the other factors that influence plant

1543
01:02:08,369 --> 01:02:15,660
growth so to me that's of high value

1544
01:02:11,389 --> 01:02:18,088
with fluent you know I'll just take you

1545
01:02:15,659 --> 01:02:19,500
back on on that and kind of reiterate

1546
01:02:18,088 --> 01:02:20,400
you know really I think the intimacy

1547
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:22,940
with our customers

1548
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:25,559
and in our research partners in parallel

1549
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:27,990
kind of having a vision that goes beyond

1550
01:02:25,559 --> 01:02:29,309
just having the best product you know if

1551
01:02:27,989 --> 01:02:30,929
you look at our products in terms of

1552
01:02:29,309 --> 01:02:33,960
their specifications they're world-class

1553
01:02:30,929 --> 01:02:36,449
they're great but that's that's short

1554
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:37,860
term right so being able to work with

1555
01:02:36,449 --> 01:02:39,389
our customers understand the ins and

1556
01:02:37,860 --> 01:02:41,430
outs of their business what are their

1557
01:02:39,389 --> 01:02:44,339
goals you know how do they succeed and

1558
01:02:41,429 --> 01:02:47,699
how can we help them succeed you know

1559
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:49,590
keeps us focused on moving forward and

1560
01:02:47,699 --> 01:02:50,939
not being complacent saying okay great

1561
01:02:49,590 --> 01:02:51,750
you know we just created a light that

1562
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:55,380
that works

1563
01:02:51,750 --> 01:02:57,769
now let's know it's on them so you know

1564
01:02:55,380 --> 01:03:02,610
customer success has been from day one

1565
01:02:57,769 --> 01:03:04,259
our key focus you know what got me

1566
01:03:02,610 --> 01:03:07,260
excited about your company was the fact

1567
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:09,990
that I heard that a large commercial

1568
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:12,450
basil grower was using your using your

1569
01:03:09,989 --> 01:03:14,399
lights the fact that someone outside of

1570
01:03:12,449 --> 01:03:15,899
the cannabis industry and that you guys

1571
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:21,960
were working with people in agriculture

1572
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:24,180
was able to be profitable using using

1573
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:25,889
your lighting technology I think is huge

1574
01:03:24,179 --> 01:03:27,809
you don't see that with a lot of

1575
01:03:25,889 --> 01:03:29,909
companies and the fact that you're doing

1576
01:03:27,809 --> 01:03:31,320
all this research with you know Cornell

1577
01:03:29,909 --> 01:03:34,710
and some of these other research

1578
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:37,980
universities that are known for Ag is

1579
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:40,619
really what sold me on your company yeah

1580
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:42,119
that Dedham that's key you know all

1581
01:03:40,619 --> 01:03:44,730
these plants are connected whether we're

1582
01:03:42,119 --> 01:03:48,059
talking about basil cannabis petunias

1583
01:03:44,730 --> 01:03:50,369
you know a lot of a lot of what we learn

1584
01:03:48,059 --> 01:03:52,079
from one can be applied to the other so

1585
01:03:50,369 --> 01:03:54,329
we find about you in learning from

1586
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:56,579
multiple life Goods industries instead

1587
01:03:54,329 --> 01:03:58,259
of just focusing on one where let's say

1588
01:03:56,579 --> 01:04:03,569
in some cases it could be limited on

1589
01:03:58,260 --> 01:04:05,760
what we learn yeah yeah and I would I'd

1590
01:04:03,570 --> 01:04:07,860
be remiss if I didn't talk about a study

1591
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:09,270
that we're doing right now with dr.

1592
01:04:07,860 --> 01:04:12,870
Bruce Bugbee at Utah State University

1593
01:04:09,269 --> 01:04:14,400
he's a meeting plant physiologist and I

1594
01:04:12,869 --> 01:04:16,859
kind of talk about you know how much we

1595
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:18,599
don't know right now and you know we

1596
01:04:16,860 --> 01:04:20,340
define par going back to the very

1597
01:04:18,599 --> 01:04:22,829
beginning of our conversation is 400 to

1598
01:04:20,340 --> 01:04:24,539
700 nanometers and the study we're doing

1599
01:04:22,829 --> 01:04:28,079
right now is to debunk that we're

1600
01:04:24,539 --> 01:04:30,360
actively looking to say is this true is

1601
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:32,340
this knowledge that we are building on

1602
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:33,900
true or or is there room for improvement

1603
01:04:32,340 --> 01:04:35,850
and so

1604
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:38,070
by working with the growers and as the

1605
01:04:35,849 --> 01:04:40,230
commercial horticulture industry rapidly

1606
01:04:38,070 --> 01:04:43,650
evolved due to disruptions in technology

1607
01:04:40,230 --> 01:04:45,329
and growing populations at the same time

1608
01:04:43,650 --> 01:04:47,400
giving these researchers tools to

1609
01:04:45,329 --> 01:04:51,059
continue to you know give us the

1610
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:53,460
knowledge to make them more efficient is

1611
01:04:51,059 --> 01:04:57,119
going to be I think radically changing

1612
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:58,619
how people grow plants in the future I I

1613
01:04:57,119 --> 01:05:00,119
don't want to extend this podcast too

1614
01:04:58,619 --> 01:05:03,029
much longer because I've taken so much

1615
01:05:00,119 --> 01:05:05,190
of your day already but I did I did have

1616
01:05:03,030 --> 01:05:08,160
a question in terms of it made me think

1617
01:05:05,190 --> 01:05:09,599
of plant myths associated lighting so

1618
01:05:08,159 --> 01:05:15,239
one of the like we talked a little bit

1619
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:17,420
about optimal veg photo periods and you

1620
01:05:15,239 --> 01:05:20,579
guys didn't give me like an exact

1621
01:05:17,420 --> 01:05:22,950
general recommendation but you kind of

1622
01:05:20,579 --> 01:05:25,349
explained why I'm wondering in terms of

1623
01:05:22,949 --> 01:05:27,509
like those green headlamps do plants see

1624
01:05:25,349 --> 01:05:29,789
that green light I've always heard that

1625
01:05:27,510 --> 01:05:31,710
they don't but does that have the pencil

1626
01:05:29,789 --> 01:05:33,420
potential to affect the health of your

1627
01:05:31,710 --> 01:05:38,039
crop people are using green lights to go

1628
01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:41,099
in during a dark cycle um no I would say

1629
01:05:38,039 --> 01:05:44,039
there's not I've not heard of that being

1630
01:05:41,099 --> 01:05:48,170
beneficial at all and and to me there

1631
01:05:44,039 --> 01:05:50,190
there is there is detrimental yeah that

1632
01:05:48,170 --> 01:05:51,750
anything you could possibly be

1633
01:05:50,190 --> 01:05:53,789
disturbing the photo period by having

1634
01:05:51,750 --> 01:05:55,260
any light on at all depending on your

1635
01:05:53,789 --> 01:05:57,090
other factors you know even though we

1636
01:05:55,260 --> 01:05:59,370
say photo periods triggered by far red

1637
01:05:57,090 --> 01:06:01,050
or red even if you have some other light

1638
01:05:59,369 --> 01:06:03,779
if it's at a certain intensity you could

1639
01:06:01,050 --> 01:06:06,450
still trigger a photo period response so

1640
01:06:03,780 --> 01:06:08,190
if you if you have a dark period you

1641
01:06:06,449 --> 01:06:10,049
know and like like Travis said you know

1642
01:06:08,190 --> 01:06:12,420
a lot of plants responses are due to

1643
01:06:10,050 --> 01:06:14,850
having the dark period as their

1644
01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:17,159
photoreceptor key I certainly would not

1645
01:06:14,849 --> 01:06:20,549
have any other lights in on during the

1646
01:06:17,159 --> 01:06:23,129
dark period yeah that if you if you look

1647
01:06:20,550 --> 01:06:24,750
at why people use green lights if they

1648
01:06:23,130 --> 01:06:26,430
have to go into a room when the lights

1649
01:06:24,750 --> 01:06:27,809
are all that comes from that

1650
01:06:26,429 --> 01:06:31,469
misconception that plants don't use

1651
01:06:27,809 --> 01:06:34,199
green light you know and so yeah it

1652
01:06:31,469 --> 01:06:35,819
that's where it comes from that's why

1653
01:06:34,199 --> 01:06:39,539
people choose green it's probably the

1654
01:06:35,820 --> 01:06:40,920
least disruptive but it's still much

1655
01:06:39,539 --> 01:06:42,480
other said it still would have an impact

1656
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:44,210
especially given the duration and

1657
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:45,869
intensity that you go in there with so

1658
01:06:44,210 --> 01:06:47,670
obviously I don't think people are

1659
01:06:45,869 --> 01:06:49,079
seeing any death

1660
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:51,559
when they go in there with their little

1661
01:06:49,079 --> 01:06:53,340
headlamps but if you were to turn on

1662
01:06:51,559 --> 01:06:55,170
high-intensity green lamps in there

1663
01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:57,750
during the and this little period you

1664
01:06:55,170 --> 01:06:59,220
absolutely would see an impact so that

1665
01:06:57,750 --> 01:07:02,489
just kind of made me wonder are there

1666
01:06:59,219 --> 01:07:04,379
any other sort of like lighting myths or

1667
01:07:02,489 --> 01:07:06,000
sort of established things in the

1668
01:07:04,380 --> 01:07:11,010
industry that you guys have found to

1669
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:12,750
just not be very accurate well I would

1670
01:07:11,010 --> 01:07:15,810
use this time to simply say watts per

1671
01:07:12,750 --> 01:07:18,389
square foot I know that's not like total

1672
01:07:15,809 --> 01:07:20,039
biology related but using watts per

1673
01:07:18,389 --> 01:07:24,809
square foot to try to determine you know

1674
01:07:20,039 --> 01:07:29,119
how much how much light you needed not

1675
01:07:24,809 --> 01:07:32,309
accurate so so what should we be using

1676
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:34,679
ppfd okay

1677
01:07:32,309 --> 01:07:36,989
one other question that reminded me of

1678
01:07:34,679 --> 01:07:38,579
was when I first started looking at

1679
01:07:36,989 --> 01:07:40,500
lights people were using the term lumens

1680
01:07:38,579 --> 01:07:44,159
but that's not something you guys have

1681
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:46,010
mentioned once in this talk can you can

1682
01:07:44,159 --> 01:07:48,179
you touch on that real quickly

1683
01:07:46,010 --> 01:07:48,720
Travis I'll mention one thing here so

1684
01:07:48,179 --> 01:07:50,549
that it

1685
01:07:48,719 --> 01:07:52,109
there's many terms out there also

1686
01:07:50,550 --> 01:07:55,350
depending on where you are in the world

1687
01:07:52,110 --> 01:07:57,510
on how you how you refer to to light in

1688
01:07:55,349 --> 01:07:59,009
general and so let's say in early in the

1689
01:07:57,510 --> 01:08:00,870
horticultural industry there they were

1690
01:07:59,010 --> 01:08:03,150
fertilized foot candles right and this

1691
01:08:00,869 --> 01:08:04,859
was based on what you could see you know

1692
01:08:03,150 --> 01:08:06,300
so you made your judgment based on what

1693
01:08:04,860 --> 01:08:08,220
you could visually see and what we've

1694
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:10,380
learned with LEDs is we can trust what

1695
01:08:08,219 --> 01:08:12,059
we what we see we have to trust in the

1696
01:08:10,380 --> 01:08:14,670
technology now because it's surpassed

1697
01:08:12,059 --> 01:08:17,250
our our ability to just perceive exactly

1698
01:08:14,670 --> 01:08:19,829
what's going on so some of these units

1699
01:08:17,250 --> 01:08:21,630
of measure in some ways are I don't know

1700
01:08:19,829 --> 01:08:23,789
if you could call them legacy units of

1701
01:08:21,630 --> 01:08:26,489
measure but we we've surpassed them with

1702
01:08:23,789 --> 01:08:29,750
our understanding so we now use ppfd and

1703
01:08:26,489 --> 01:08:33,090
micromoles you know as a common cohesive

1704
01:08:29,750 --> 01:08:35,819
understanding of light or light

1705
01:08:33,090 --> 01:08:39,150
specifically for biological processes

1706
01:08:35,819 --> 01:08:40,889
and plants yep except yeah so we all

1707
01:08:39,149 --> 01:08:42,569
need to be on the same page instead of

1708
01:08:40,890 --> 01:08:44,660
terminology is what you're saying so

1709
01:08:42,569 --> 01:08:48,269
that we can compare apples to apples

1710
01:08:44,659 --> 01:08:50,220
exactly that and making sure we're using

1711
01:08:48,270 --> 01:08:53,010
the right the right terminology for the

1712
01:08:50,220 --> 01:08:55,460
right application so light is used for

1713
01:08:53,010 --> 01:08:59,100
many things and if you're trying to

1714
01:08:55,460 --> 01:09:01,679
determine you know what lighting is best

1715
01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:04,949
for your plants but you're using

1716
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:07,139
human-based metrics for vision things

1717
01:09:04,948 --> 01:09:09,928
will be will not go well and you could

1718
01:09:07,139 --> 01:09:12,389
just take if you take a ceramic metal

1719
01:09:09,929 --> 01:09:16,679
halide fixture that has a really cool

1720
01:09:12,389 --> 01:09:19,079
white visual appeal to it and then you

1721
01:09:16,679 --> 01:09:21,838
take say our spectrum which has a very

1722
01:09:19,079 --> 01:09:23,880
similar similar look to the human eye

1723
01:09:21,838 --> 01:09:27,600
they look very similar now if you look

1724
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:29,039
at them on a spectral radiometer in

1725
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:31,588
terms of how planes perceive them

1726
01:09:29,039 --> 01:09:32,729
they're dramatically different so it's

1727
01:09:31,588 --> 01:09:35,698
just making sure that you're using the

1728
01:09:32,729 --> 01:09:38,968
right metrics based on the the

1729
01:09:35,698 --> 01:09:41,548
appropriate application that's a really

1730
01:09:38,969 --> 01:09:42,750
good point because you're right they do

1731
01:09:41,548 --> 01:09:44,130
look very similar to me and I don't

1732
01:09:42,750 --> 01:09:48,000
always think about the fact that there's

1733
01:09:44,130 --> 01:09:50,420
a lot going on that I can't see so I

1734
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:53,520
guess where I would kind of wanted to

1735
01:09:50,420 --> 01:09:56,609
finish up this podcast with and maybe

1736
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:59,190
other Travis I could we can talk again

1737
01:09:56,609 --> 01:10:00,839
about some of your background in terms

1738
01:09:59,189 --> 01:10:02,309
of environmental controls I'd love to

1739
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:03,510
have you back on to talk more about that

1740
01:10:02,310 --> 01:10:05,730
because I know you're a wealth of

1741
01:10:03,510 --> 01:10:07,139
knowledge there but where do where do

1742
01:10:05,729 --> 01:10:09,359
you guys see the future of lighting

1743
01:10:07,139 --> 01:10:10,289
headed I know we've touched on some of

1744
01:10:09,359 --> 01:10:13,079
these different things that are

1745
01:10:10,289 --> 01:10:14,698
obviously that we're not there yet on

1746
01:10:13,079 --> 01:10:19,319
but is there anything else in terms of

1747
01:10:14,698 --> 01:10:20,669
where we're going with lighting well me

1748
01:10:19,319 --> 01:10:23,880
and Travis have actually spoken about

1749
01:10:20,670 --> 01:10:26,190
this a few times and so my understanding

1750
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:28,289
especially after coming to fluence now

1751
01:10:26,189 --> 01:10:30,419
is the next step with you know with

1752
01:10:28,289 --> 01:10:34,859
light in general for plant applications

1753
01:10:30,420 --> 01:10:37,319
is to have you know kind of intelligent

1754
01:10:34,859 --> 01:10:38,609
lighting systems right so so every

1755
01:10:37,319 --> 01:10:42,139
single one of your factors are all

1756
01:10:38,609 --> 01:10:44,189
controlled together and cohesively

1757
01:10:42,139 --> 01:10:48,270
Travis I'll let you elaborate more on

1758
01:10:44,189 --> 01:10:49,349
that topic yeah I think um you know you

1759
01:10:48,270 --> 01:10:50,969
got you have to look at the future I

1760
01:10:49,350 --> 01:10:53,250
think I look at it in two different ways

1761
01:10:50,969 --> 01:10:54,658
kind of the immediate future

1762
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:56,670
you know maybe within the next five

1763
01:10:54,658 --> 01:10:59,460
years and then the quote-unquote distant

1764
01:10:56,670 --> 01:11:02,489
future you know five 15 years from now

1765
01:10:59,460 --> 01:11:05,069
which will probably become much quicker

1766
01:11:02,488 --> 01:11:06,839
than any of us expect but if you look at

1767
01:11:05,069 --> 01:11:10,408
the immediate future it's definitely

1768
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:14,909
going to be about continued efficiencies

1769
01:11:10,408 --> 01:11:17,279
in the in the platform lower costs you

1770
01:11:14,909 --> 01:11:19,979
increase performance really fine-tuning

1771
01:11:17,279 --> 01:11:22,829
spectrum as we unlock more research and

1772
01:11:19,979 --> 01:11:26,759
and getting the the pieces of the puzzle

1773
01:11:22,829 --> 01:11:29,010
built for intelligence so when you look

1774
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:32,010
at you know the Internet of Things and

1775
01:11:29,010 --> 01:11:34,140
you look at connectivity and you look at

1776
01:11:32,010 --> 01:11:35,760
Big Data you look at everything that

1777
01:11:34,140 --> 01:11:39,110
we're doing and are personalized with

1778
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:42,659
computing and smart homes a networking

1779
01:11:39,109 --> 01:11:44,759
bringing that into the garden to make

1780
01:11:42,659 --> 01:11:47,639
things more efficient I think will be

1781
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:50,039
here relatively soon and then you can

1782
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:51,270
start to automate the garden you can

1783
01:11:50,039 --> 01:11:53,970
start to bring a level of intelligence

1784
01:11:51,270 --> 01:11:56,790
and sophistication to it that we we've

1785
01:11:53,970 --> 01:12:00,210
never had before in our food supply

1786
01:11:56,789 --> 01:12:01,800
chain and and so the other Travis and I

1787
01:12:00,210 --> 01:12:03,720
were talking about this a couple weeks

1788
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:05,640
ago especially as it relates to his role

1789
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:07,470
which is you know fluence right now is

1790
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:09,060
taking very much an educational approach

1791
01:12:07,470 --> 01:12:11,100
really trying to educate our customers

1792
01:12:09,060 --> 01:12:13,620
on photo biology and horticulture

1793
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:14,970
lighting and educating our customers

1794
01:12:13,619 --> 01:12:16,979
across the spectrum I mean that's

1795
01:12:14,970 --> 01:12:19,079
Travis's job is to help out with all

1796
01:12:16,979 --> 01:12:21,599
these other factors outside of lighting

1797
01:12:19,079 --> 01:12:23,789
the interplay of lighting and I think

1798
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:26,280
soon you know our role is going to shift

1799
01:12:23,789 --> 01:12:28,619
from and I think academia and the

1800
01:12:26,279 --> 01:12:30,809
industry large will shift from educating

1801
01:12:28,619 --> 01:12:33,420
growers on you know how to how to spec

1802
01:12:30,810 --> 01:12:36,600
botrytis how to detect a nitrogen

1803
01:12:33,420 --> 01:12:39,720
deficiency to how to manage a robot that

1804
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:41,579
does that how to program a system that

1805
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:43,530
can detect that and then maintain those

1806
01:12:41,579 --> 01:12:45,600
systems so you're gonna see a whole

1807
01:12:43,529 --> 01:12:48,359
shift and lighting will definitely be a

1808
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:50,430
component of that an integral component

1809
01:12:48,359 --> 01:12:53,759
of that as more intelligence that's

1810
01:12:50,430 --> 01:12:55,200
brought to the department that's

1811
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:57,600
