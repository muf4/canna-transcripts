welcome to the Cannabis cultivation and

5
00:00:19,618 --> 00:00:23,820
science podcast I'm your host Tad Hussey

6
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:25,679
of Kiss Organics this is the podcast

7
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,300
where we discuss The Cutting Edge of

8
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:29,518
growing from a science-based perspective

9
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,960
and drawing top experts from around the

10
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:33,179
industry to share their wisdom and

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,520
knowledge my guest this week is Michael

12
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:37,920
brownbridge Michael is a biological

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,899
program manager with bioworks in this

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,579
role he provides technical support for

15
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:43,259
the company's catalog of disease

16
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:45,058
management products and their

17
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:47,878
utilization in integrated plant health

18
00:00:45,058 --> 00:00:49,919
programs prior to joining bioworks in

19
00:00:47,878 --> 00:00:51,899
2019 he was fortunate enough to have

20
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,640
traveled the world flying his craft with

21
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:56,100
research and Outreach positions in

22
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,960
Israel Kenya the United States New

23
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,760
Zealand and Canada putting new

24
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,280
biological control tools and knowledge

25
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:04,319
into the hands of Growers now on to the

26
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,820
show

27
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,739
hey Michael thanks for coming on the

28
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:10,079
show today

29
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:12,839
oh it's a pleasure Todd I'm glad I was

30
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:14,280
finally able to make it to have a chat

31
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,100
with you

32
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,299
you know me too I I kept saying I

33
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:20,699
thought we'd recorded this podcast

34
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:22,259
together because we've talked so much

35
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:26,159
um so I'm really grateful for you coming

36
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:27,780
on the show and uh I wanted to start off

37
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,640
kind of just taking a little bit

38
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,978
different angle and and getting since

39
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,879
you are a pathologist well sorry let me

40
00:01:31,978 --> 00:01:34,679
back up why don't you tell me a little

41
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:37,859
bit about yourself

42
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,240
all right I'll I'm a I'm a recent

43
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:42,180
pathologist

44
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:46,679
um truth be told Tad um I spend a lot of

45
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:49,920
my career actually working on the insect

46
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:52,079
control side of crop management and

47
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,420
transitioned into

48
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:56,519
pathology because

49
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,560
one of the you know I firmly believe

50
00:01:56,519 --> 00:02:01,438
that when you're doing Crop Production

51
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,060
you you cannot look at just one thing in

52
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:05,459
isolation you've got to look at the

53
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:08,098
whole crop and if you have pest issues

54
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:10,019
why do you have pest issues and

55
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:13,199
um do pest issues lead to disease issues

56
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:15,780
and so an understanding of the whole so

57
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:19,098
um as my career progressed it became

58
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:22,199
less just focused on insects and more on

59
00:02:19,098 --> 00:02:25,619
the crop taking an integrated approach

60
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:27,899
to crop management rather than Pest

61
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:29,640
Management or disease management and and

62
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,739
then more recently

63
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:35,419
um as my responsibilities have shifted

64
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:39,539
I've taken a more active role in

65
00:02:35,419 --> 00:02:42,119
Plant Pathology and use of Biologicals

66
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:43,799
to control plant pathogens or manage

67
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,060
plant pathogens is probably a better way

68
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:49,439
to put it

69
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:54,000
so a bit of a jack of all trades and

70
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:54,000
dangerous in a lot of things but

71
00:02:54,598 --> 00:02:58,619
um yeah I've I've really enjoyed getting

72
00:02:56,818 --> 00:03:01,919
deeper and deeper into the Plant

73
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:04,200
Pathology world it was not something I

74
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:06,238
thought I might do originally but it's

75
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:09,060
been a fantastic Journey

76
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:12,140
um and I'm enjoying it tremendously

77
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:15,120
yeah so so given your background

78
00:03:12,139 --> 00:03:17,339
how do you approach a cultivation space

79
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,680
and let's just use an indoor cultivation

80
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:21,719
space for this example

81
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,340
um how do you approach that from a from

82
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:25,859
a pathologist perspective and how does

83
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:27,900
that differ say from like a grower or an

84
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:29,459
entomologist

85
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,459
yeah

86
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,459
um

87
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:37,680
I think any time

88
00:03:34,378 --> 00:03:39,479
you enter a space it's it's always very

89
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:43,080
tempting to

90
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:44,878
hone in on something specific

91
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:49,200
I think you have to take a couple of

92
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:51,719
moments really to just appreciate the

93
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:53,518
environment

94
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:57,060
and I mean environment in the broadest

95
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:59,879
sense there that you're walking into

96
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:02,098
um understanding you know what's going

97
00:03:59,878 --> 00:04:04,739
on what sort of heating lighting

98
00:04:02,098 --> 00:04:06,298
ventilation systems do you have what

99
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:08,099
sort of watering systems do you have

100
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:11,040
what sort of watching regime do you have

101
00:04:08,098 --> 00:04:11,759
how do you water the plants

102
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:13,798
um

103
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:15,840
how tightly packed are the plants

104
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:19,739
there's a there's a lot going on in a

105
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:22,139
crop at any given time and you know

106
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:25,439
plant diseases

107
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:29,120
typically don't just appear because they

108
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:32,879
feel like it you know there's there's uh

109
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:35,699
circumstances that result in that

110
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:37,560
disease manifesting itself on a plant

111
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:40,020
so you

112
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:42,839
sometimes can tell based on the disease

113
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:44,698
but oftentimes

114
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:46,560
say it's it's the environmental

115
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:49,500
conditions it's too humid there's not

116
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,780
enough air movement to keep that air dry

117
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:55,459
or the leaves dry that that sort of

118
00:04:51,779 --> 00:04:58,258
predisposed plants to certain diseases

119
00:04:55,459 --> 00:05:00,899
is the medium over watered if it's over

120
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:03,360
watered over watered again that can

121
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:06,179
predispose the plant to certain diseases

122
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,580
how are the plants being fed so I think

123
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:12,360
you know if I boil it down to a sentence

124
00:05:08,579 --> 00:05:14,159
it's it's coming into a into a room and

125
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:17,100
then appreciating

126
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:20,160
how that plant is being grown first and

127
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:21,780
foremost and then saying okay let's go

128
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,699
have a look what are your problems

129
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:26,159
here's why I think it may be happening

130
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:28,319
and here's how I think here are some

131
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,620
steps that I think will be will will

132
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:30,620
help

133
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:36,959
so you're essentially trying to

134
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:39,360
identify all of the different variables

135
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:41,638
that go into this plant's growing

136
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,080
conditions or or overall health it

137
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:45,600
sounds like

138
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:47,698
um yeah pretty much anything yeah just

139
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,560
to say all the variables I think that

140
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:52,560
would be a little much a little too much

141
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:54,240
but certainly the the key variables you

142
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,879
know I'm sure

143
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,978
you and many of your listeners are

144
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:01,319
familiar with the good old disease

145
00:05:58,978 --> 00:06:04,560
triangle you know where

146
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:07,259
there are basically three three primary

147
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,839
things which control whether

148
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:11,580
um a disease will take on your repair on

149
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:15,299
your plants

150
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:16,859
um or not one of them is environment an

151
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:21,418
environment again in the broadest sense

152
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:24,900
the other one is that the disease has to

153
00:06:21,418 --> 00:06:26,939
be present that inoculum the infection

154
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:29,638
the Infectious part of that disease has

155
00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:32,100
to be present at high enough levels to

156
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:35,519
be able to infect a plant and so you you

157
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:37,259
need virulent inoculum in inside that

158
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:38,698
inside that room that Greenhouse

159
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:40,379
Wherever You Are

160
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:43,080
and certainly you have to have a

161
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:46,199
susceptible plant and there's a lot of

162
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:48,659
factors will affect

163
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:50,280
all of those variables

164
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:51,900
you know environment what does

165
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:54,779
environment mean if you have in relative

166
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:58,138
humidity we can manage relative humidity

167
00:06:54,779 --> 00:07:00,239
we can manage that through good air

168
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:01,500
exchange good air movement between the

169
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,360
plants let's say so you don't get

170
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,939
localized humidity

171
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,699
we can manage

172
00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:11,100
um the crop to a degree

173
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:13,919
in terms of which varieties we choose to

174
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:16,259
go I know that in in cannabis you know

175
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:17,818
varieties are normally you know the

176
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:20,400
varieties that have grown are driven

177
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:23,039
more by market than than my choice for

178
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:25,859
say a variety which is more tolerant to

179
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:27,360
certain diseases or not but how else can

180
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:29,939
we affect the plant and its

181
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,160
susceptibility genetics is one thing but

182
00:07:29,939 --> 00:07:33,240
the second part is really how you grow

183
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,939
that plant

184
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:39,060
so yes you know how you grow it do you

185
00:07:35,939 --> 00:07:41,459
as I mentioned earlier over watering

186
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:43,860
underwatering too much of certain

187
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:47,459
fertilizers too little fertilizers Etc

188
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:48,538
how you grow that plant matters so it

189
00:07:47,459 --> 00:07:50,939
can

190
00:07:48,538 --> 00:07:52,680
make that plant more or less susceptible

191
00:07:50,939 --> 00:07:55,259
to the disease

192
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:58,319
and then the third thing you know do we

193
00:07:55,259 --> 00:08:00,000
have sufficient infectious inoculum in

194
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,699
the plant that can be influenced Again

195
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,519
by so many things by

196
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:08,580
people can bring that inoculum into the

197
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:10,439
greenhouse or the grow room it can be

198
00:08:08,579 --> 00:08:12,659
there in the media it can come in on the

199
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:15,360
plants so there are a whole lot of

200
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:18,180
variables underneath each variable but

201
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:21,240
having a good sense of that I think

202
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:22,379
makes you realize perhaps where to

203
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,840
invest

204
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:26,939
your time and energy in terms of being

205
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:29,698
able to prevent a disease or to

206
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:32,879
successfully control it so I think it is

207
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:34,740
important to take account of as many of

208
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:37,979
those variables as you can on you know

209
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:40,259
clearly we can't do everything but we do

210
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:42,719
we we can I think have a have a good

211
00:08:40,259 --> 00:08:44,639
sense of what goes on and be behave a

212
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:47,760
little bit like um

213
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:49,679
detectives to a degree to figure out of

214
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:52,439
of all of these variables which are the

215
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:56,219
most likely and and those things can

216
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:58,800
then help you narrow down sometimes as

217
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:01,500
to what disease it is some diseases are

218
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:03,778
pretty self-evident particularly some of

219
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:06,720
the foliar diseases that are prevalent

220
00:09:03,778 --> 00:09:08,820
in in cannabis but some of the below

221
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,620
ground diseases you know good luck but

222
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:14,240
we do understand

223
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:16,860
certain conditions which will which will

224
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:20,039
make it easier for those diseases to

225
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:22,200
occur let's say so yeah it's it's I

226
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:23,759
think understanding a little bit

227
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:28,200
um

228
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:31,019
what drives disease occurrence

229
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,879
helps and I think it would having that

230
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:35,700
again understanding you know the old

231
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:37,019
saying understand thine enemy if you

232
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,300
understand your enemy you can understand

233
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:41,700
how to

234
00:09:39,299 --> 00:09:44,579
um prevent that Enemy by understanding

235
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:47,700
what what specific conditions really

236
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:49,800
promote uh its incidents so it's

237
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:52,860
important it's important to take to take

238
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:54,299
that type of approach so even with pest

239
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:57,120
you know there's a relationship between

240
00:09:54,299 --> 00:10:00,958
all of those all of those um

241
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:04,259
plant environment and and pest

242
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:06,119
uh incidents too so again understanding

243
00:10:04,259 --> 00:10:09,319
the crop first is is probably one of the

244
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,320
most important things you can do

245
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:14,580
so assuming that we do have an issue a

246
00:10:13,139 --> 00:10:18,620
plant issue

247
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:21,959
um I would guess the next step would be

248
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:23,220
proper identification of that of that

249
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:26,939
disease

250
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:30,060
it's it's important to have diseases

251
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:31,620
identified correctly because that can

252
00:10:30,059 --> 00:10:34,379
actually determine

253
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:36,480
how you go about

254
00:10:34,379 --> 00:10:39,179
controlling

255
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,300
or preventing that disease

256
00:10:39,179 --> 00:10:41,299
um

257
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:47,540
so for a disease like powdery mildew it

258
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:50,278
it has quite characteristic symptoms

259
00:10:47,539 --> 00:10:52,679
although you wouldn't necessarily be

260
00:10:50,278 --> 00:10:54,778
able to identify the species

261
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:57,299
um you know there's powdery mildew

262
00:10:54,778 --> 00:10:59,639
itself is not one fungal species it's a

263
00:10:57,299 --> 00:11:02,099
it's a collection of fungal species that

264
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:04,860
have very similar symptoms on different

265
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:07,620
host plants but in cannabis you know

266
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:09,600
those white fluffy growths on the on the

267
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:11,220
foliage that's pretty likely to be

268
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,980
powdery mildew

269
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:14,940
when you get down below ground

270
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:17,820
um

271
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:19,740
there are several diseases which can

272
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:22,620
infect the roots and subsequently sort

273
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:24,659
of move up through the uh through the

274
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:26,459
through the the vascular system of the

275
00:11:24,659 --> 00:11:29,179
plant so

276
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:32,359
actually determining which of those

277
00:11:29,179 --> 00:11:35,278
killed the plant or made the plant sick

278
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:38,879
is not always easy because they look

279
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:42,240
very similar and sometimes

280
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:44,278
one disease can predispose that plant to

281
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,919
infection by another disease and it's

282
00:11:44,278 --> 00:11:48,659
that second disease which actually kills

283
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:50,939
the plant or renders it you know very

284
00:11:48,659 --> 00:11:52,799
very sick so it is important to get

285
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:54,959
proper diagnosis so you can understand

286
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:55,799
how to

287
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:59,578
um

288
00:11:55,799 --> 00:12:02,578
what steps to take against that disease

289
00:11:59,578 --> 00:12:05,219
preliminary diagnoses may tell you some

290
00:12:02,578 --> 00:12:06,719
very basic steps like if you can just

291
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:09,240
take the plant out because you're not

292
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,680
going to be able to save it you know but

293
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,440
but I think it's important to get a

294
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:16,819
diagnosis at some point in the proceding

295
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:20,579
as well because it it can also help

296
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:24,120
identify the source of that infection

297
00:12:20,578 --> 00:12:26,719
for example we know that you know a lot

298
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:31,139
of diseases can be

299
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:34,019
can't come into a grow via infected

300
00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:34,919
clones let's say

301
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:36,778
um

302
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:40,019
but you can't really prove that if you

303
00:12:36,778 --> 00:12:41,539
don't test or do a disease test to begin

304
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:45,539
with let's say

305
00:12:41,539 --> 00:12:48,299
sometimes disease comes in on certain

306
00:12:45,539 --> 00:12:51,299
media you don't know that unless you

307
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:53,039
test your media or you test your uh test

308
00:12:51,299 --> 00:12:56,819
your test your plant for a specific

309
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:57,919
disease so it's kind of a key piece of

310
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:00,420
the puzzle

311
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:03,120
not only from a treatment perspective

312
00:13:00,419 --> 00:13:05,578
but looking ahead to the Future Okay

313
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,259
where did it come in how did it come in

314
00:13:05,578 --> 00:13:09,299
and then how can I prevent that

315
00:13:07,259 --> 00:13:12,600
happening again in the future so yeah

316
00:13:09,299 --> 00:13:14,039
it's an important step

317
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,740
foreign

318
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:19,639
so how prevalent are a lot of these

319
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:21,200
plant diseases like you know pythium

320
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:24,539
fusarium

321
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:26,519
powdery mildew like is it I realize we

322
00:13:24,539 --> 00:13:29,399
can reduce

323
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:31,259
uh pathogen pressure but is it really

324
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:33,539
possible to keep those things completely

325
00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:36,480
out of a facility and so is it more

326
00:13:33,539 --> 00:13:38,879
about managing thresholds or having a

327
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,560
healthy hot less stressed plant or or

328
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:41,879
how do you I guess how do you approach

329
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:44,638
that

330
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:46,919
yeah I think you hit the the two Nails

331
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:49,139
let's stay on the head there

332
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:52,259
um yes I think a lot of these diseases

333
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:53,879
are often present whether we like it or

334
00:13:52,259 --> 00:13:56,578
not

335
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:57,720
um so it comes down to how how do you

336
00:13:56,578 --> 00:14:01,379
keep

337
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:04,139
numbers low because diseases like pests

338
00:14:01,379 --> 00:14:06,600
you know plants can tolerate

339
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:08,820
low levels of disease or maybe it's the

340
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,860
levels of disease that are present are

341
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:13,320
not high enough to actually infect the

342
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:15,240
plant because the plant will will be

343
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:18,000
able to withstand a certain a certain

344
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:20,639
level of Challenge from a disease

345
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,100
um I think that's where maintaining a

346
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,560
healthy plant is absolutely essential

347
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:27,000
you know

348
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:30,119
growing the plant not forcing the plant

349
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:33,440
too much making sure it has what it

350
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:36,899
needs when it needs it rather than

351
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,940
trying to sort of force feed it or

352
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:41,820
grow it in a swamp when it should be

353
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:43,980
grown dry or dryer things like that you

354
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:46,379
want that plant to be as healthy as

355
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:49,379
healthy as possible I think it's also

356
00:14:46,379 --> 00:14:51,240
important to to take very seriously you

357
00:14:49,379 --> 00:14:54,240
know before you even start growing the

358
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:56,419
plant is we we oftentimes when we talk

359
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,720
we say you know sanitation first

360
00:14:56,419 --> 00:15:02,338
sanitation is so so important

361
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,480
by way of

362
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:06,199
um

363
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:10,199
the area you're growing the plant in

364
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:13,979
making sure that's clean sanitation by

365
00:15:10,198 --> 00:15:15,719
how say workers come in and work in a

366
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:17,759
certain space

367
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:20,959
if

368
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:23,879
you have an area where there's a known

369
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:26,399
degree of infection let's say or pests

370
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:28,379
for that matter then don't go there

371
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,000
first go there last go into the clean

372
00:15:28,379 --> 00:15:31,639
rooms where the crops are still clean

373
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,559
first for example

374
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:36,320
understanding your water is your water

375
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:39,419
clean is your water

376
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:41,399
full of disease

377
00:15:39,419 --> 00:15:43,559
because of where you're pulling that

378
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:45,659
water supply from have you had water

379
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:46,619
tested so there's a lot of steps can be

380
00:15:45,659 --> 00:15:48,958
taken

381
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:51,120
right from the get-go to ensure you're

382
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:52,679
growing that plant in the best and

383
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,519
cleanest environment that you can make

384
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:55,799
it

385
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:58,440
and then it comes to sort of knowing the

386
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:59,759
plant material not just buying uh

387
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,540
necessarily the cheapest or what's

388
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:06,419
available but but I think having a good

389
00:16:02,539 --> 00:16:09,120
trusted supply for uh safety buying in

390
00:16:06,419 --> 00:16:12,599
clones rather than doing them yourself

391
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:15,179
um I I see a lot of benefits to

392
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:17,220
growing plants or at least mother plants

393
00:16:15,179 --> 00:16:19,559
from say tissue cultured material

394
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:22,339
because you know there's a there's a

395
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:24,838
very high degree of certainty that those

396
00:16:22,339 --> 00:16:28,620
tissue culture plantlets are going to be

397
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:29,880
free of disease period so

398
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:32,698
um

399
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:34,578
again using disease-free stock as your

400
00:16:32,698 --> 00:16:36,958
starting point is going to eliminate

401
00:16:34,578 --> 00:16:41,039
potential Ingress of a lot of pathogens

402
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:43,679
to these areas but you know we live in a

403
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:46,219
world which is got a lot of microbes

404
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:49,919
floating around in the air in the soil

405
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:52,860
that they are there so it's up to us to

406
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:55,319
to try our best to eliminate them as

407
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:57,120
best as we can from a grow room and

408
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,860
create a growing environment which

409
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:02,039
favors the plant

410
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:04,078
as much as possible and provides the

411
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:07,199
plant with what it needs to grow

412
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:10,259
healthily and robustly and and you know

413
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:13,019
it's just like us the the

414
00:17:10,259 --> 00:17:14,279
better we eat the better we sleep

415
00:17:13,019 --> 00:17:16,318
um

416
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:18,418
and look after ourselves the more likely

417
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:22,019
we are to be able to

418
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:24,660
resist certain infections

419
00:17:22,019 --> 00:17:26,639
um or at least we recover faster from

420
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:30,540
those infections if they occur but

421
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:32,340
generally speaking I would say say um we

422
00:17:30,539 --> 00:17:34,619
can tolerate a certain level of

423
00:17:32,339 --> 00:17:36,599
infection without falling down and

424
00:17:34,619 --> 00:17:37,759
that's a good place to be if we had to

425
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:40,379
take

426
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:43,160
certain steps to mitigate that disease

427
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:45,600
and use you know control products to

428
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:47,000
basically knock back

429
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:49,980
um

430
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,079
the disease pressure to knock back

431
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:54,058
inoculum levels and prevent it spreading

432
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:56,639
sort of from one crop one plant to

433
00:17:54,058 --> 00:18:00,240
another so yeah there's a there's a lot

434
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,980
we can do to to equip plants

435
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,960
um very very well to be able to resist

436
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:05,880
diseases too so

437
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,919
it's an interesting area it's an

438
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:10,440
interesting area

439
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:13,559
yeah yeah and I know there's testing

440
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:16,798
available like we offer testing for

441
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:19,379
you know viruses like oblating thyroid

442
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:20,879
and you know Alfalfa cucumber tobacco

443
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:24,120
Mosaic those sorts of things I know

444
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:26,280
those testing tests kits exist but for

445
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:30,000
the average grower where do we find out

446
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:32,639
if our plant has pythium or fusarium for

447
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,819
example or some of these other

448
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:38,759
um fairly common common diseases I don't

449
00:18:35,819 --> 00:18:40,918
know if pathology labs are there any

450
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:43,259
resources that are widely available

451
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:46,520
across the United States

452
00:18:43,259 --> 00:18:49,859
I I think there are

453
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:51,900
it used to be that University extension

454
00:18:49,859 --> 00:18:54,839
systems would be able to

455
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:56,519
provide those surface Services often for

456
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:58,980
a fee but they would provide those

457
00:18:56,519 --> 00:19:02,940
identification services

458
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:04,319
with the sort of sorry go ahead oh no I

459
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:06,120
just realized I asked the Canadian where

460
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:08,339
do I find pathology labs in the United

461
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:11,159
States so I realize it's probably not

462
00:19:08,339 --> 00:19:12,779
there that's all right no no no we we

463
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,120
have the same issues here Tad I mean

464
00:19:12,779 --> 00:19:16,980
it's I think it's a North American

465
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:18,659
challenge sometimes being able to find a

466
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:22,679
Testing Lab

467
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:24,600
um if you live in a state which has an

468
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:27,419
agricultural you know Most states have a

469
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:30,359
have an agricultural uh or a land grant

470
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:31,919
University which has

471
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:34,798
um some

472
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:36,600
um degree of extension services attached

473
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:39,418
to it that would be the best place to

474
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:41,639
start but I think increasingly and I'll

475
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:43,740
I'll speak for I live in Ontario in

476
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:47,160
Canada and you know and there are at

477
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:51,319
least three testing Labs that I know of

478
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:51,320
um where I could send plant material

479
00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:56,000
um it's all done for a fee it's a

480
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:59,058
fee-based service but there are those

481
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:02,700
diagnostic facilities that exist

482
00:19:59,058 --> 00:20:04,798
I suspect but I don't know for a fact

483
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:09,240
that there should be those diagnostic

484
00:20:04,798 --> 00:20:11,339
labs in the US as well within it not

485
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:13,980
necessarily within every state but

486
00:20:11,339 --> 00:20:16,678
somewhere within a sort of certain area

487
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:18,419
if we to Cluster all these states in the

488
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:19,980
Pacific Northwest let's just say for

489
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:22,400
example I'm sure there's a commercial

490
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:25,798
Testing Lab where you can send material

491
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,820
for testing and get a definitive answer

492
00:20:25,798 --> 00:20:29,460
on

493
00:20:26,819 --> 00:20:31,500
on what's infecting your your plant

494
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:33,058
within a within a reasonable amount of

495
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:35,160
time

496
00:20:33,058 --> 00:20:38,160
um switching crops for a second you know

497
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:40,620
I know a lot of um vegetable growers in

498
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:43,500
Ontario will will actually send samples

499
00:20:40,619 --> 00:20:44,219
over to the Netherlands for testing

500
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,980
um

501
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:49,679
that's a whole you know that's a whole

502
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:51,419
different undertaking but uh if there's

503
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,100
nothing available in your state that I

504
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:55,620
would say you know cast a wider net and

505
00:20:53,099 --> 00:20:58,699
and just see which testing Labs may be

506
00:20:55,619 --> 00:20:58,699
accessible to you

507
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:05,280
so assuming we're talking about

508
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:07,980
some sort of vascular root disease like

509
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:11,220
pythium or fusarium getting back to

510
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:14,220
those two how different is your is your

511
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:16,319
treatment approach for

512
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:17,400
those two diseases

513
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:20,220
um

514
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:22,259
is the plant a goner at that point since

515
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:24,058
they are vascular diseases is it better

516
00:21:22,259 --> 00:21:26,160
to just remove it and then are there

517
00:21:24,058 --> 00:21:28,379
ways to treat the soil so I realized

518
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:31,019
those a few different questions

519
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:33,240
yeah I would say once once you've got

520
00:21:31,019 --> 00:21:35,279
the disease in the vascular system and

521
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:37,079
you know you've you've probably seen the

522
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:40,019
classic pictures of plants where if you

523
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:41,519
if you sort of slice along the stem of

524
00:21:40,019 --> 00:21:43,319
the plant it's starting to go Brown

525
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:46,440
inside that's pretty good indication

526
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:49,798
that the disease has developed up

527
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:52,919
through that vascular system it's

528
00:21:49,798 --> 00:21:54,538
probably not worth investing a whole lot

529
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:57,360
of time and resources trying to save

530
00:21:54,538 --> 00:21:59,759
that plant it's it is cheaper probably

531
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:02,099
to just get rid of that you you do two

532
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:03,839
things in doing that one it's it's

533
00:22:02,099 --> 00:22:04,879
removed as a headache for you to try and

534
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:08,038
look after

535
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:10,440
and and the chances like I say of

536
00:22:08,038 --> 00:22:14,038
actually getting anything out of it are

537
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:16,140
very very low at that point and secondly

538
00:22:14,038 --> 00:22:18,359
you know the longer you keep that or

539
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:20,220
plant around the higher the likelihood

540
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:22,859
that it can serve as a source of

541
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:25,440
infection for the plants in the in the

542
00:22:22,859 --> 00:22:29,339
near vicinity

543
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:32,759
um best thing to do is is not wait until

544
00:22:29,339 --> 00:22:34,859
you see plants that are infected I would

545
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:37,460
say is to

546
00:22:34,859 --> 00:22:41,519
again know your enemy do you have

547
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:44,759
sources of infection is you know by

548
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:47,400
Water by clones by soil what are the

549
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:50,220
what are the risks posed by all of those

550
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:51,780
things in terms of is there a a

551
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:53,579
likelihood that there may be some

552
00:22:51,779 --> 00:22:56,240
infection there that you're dealing with

553
00:22:53,579 --> 00:22:58,678
or do we just go ahead and assume that

554
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,359
you know I'm working in an environment

555
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:02,640
it's highly likely that at some point

556
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:05,459
there will be disease present

557
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:08,640
when we're talking cannabis particularly

558
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:10,079
we it's not a crop where we have really

559
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:13,080
any

560
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:16,199
uh real Curative products available to

561
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:18,599
us that like in um if you if you use a

562
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:20,940
comparison be say outdoor agriculture

563
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:21,779
you know where there's a lot of

564
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:23,840
um

565
00:23:21,779 --> 00:23:27,178
synthetic chemistries

566
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:29,819
or synthetic products available where

567
00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:32,038
you can see a problem you can spray it

568
00:23:29,819 --> 00:23:34,259
with with chemistry and that takes care

569
00:23:32,038 --> 00:23:37,460
of the problem we're in the prevention

570
00:23:34,259 --> 00:23:40,440
game because we have access to

571
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:43,019
materials that really rely on us

572
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:45,960
preventing the disease issues happening

573
00:23:43,019 --> 00:23:48,058
preventing infection taking hold that

574
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:50,759
plant and protecting the plant against

575
00:23:48,058 --> 00:23:54,538
disease as best we can and this you know

576
00:23:50,759 --> 00:23:57,960
there's a number of products that can do

577
00:23:54,538 --> 00:23:59,819
that and they're best used in a in a

578
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:02,460
production system you know we we kind of

579
00:23:59,819 --> 00:24:04,740
touched on best cultural practices for

580
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:07,440
the crop so if you've got good cultural

581
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:09,179
practices in place your

582
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:12,960
your plant's going to be better equipped

583
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:15,720
to sort of handle itself and and deal

584
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:17,279
with with any any disease challenges but

585
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:20,038
that's the situation you want you want a

586
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:22,740
healthy plant that we can then layer on

587
00:24:20,038 --> 00:24:25,859
top of that some of these biological

588
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:29,579
materials to to further mitigate the

589
00:24:25,859 --> 00:24:32,038
risk or eliminate the risk of diseases

590
00:24:29,579 --> 00:24:33,839
getting into the plant so we really are

591
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:36,720
we're playing a preventative game here

592
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:38,959
by how how we approach disease

593
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,960
management

594
00:24:39,538 --> 00:24:46,440
and so what are some of the tools

595
00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:48,419
in the Gardner's arsenal when we

596
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:50,580
you know I think we may be have to deal

597
00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:52,980
with some of these things

598
00:24:50,579 --> 00:24:54,899
yeah if I start with the soil it's

599
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:56,400
probably a good place to start

600
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:58,440
um

601
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,740
there are various

602
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:05,220
um microbial

603
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:07,159
biophungicides based on uh fungi like

604
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:10,380
trichoderma

605
00:25:07,159 --> 00:25:13,080
or bacteria and there's you know various

606
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:15,240
bacillus species which which can be

607
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:18,000
really used effectively both the

608
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,720
trichoderma and the bacillus species

609
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,819
um

610
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:26,700
work extremely well in terms of

611
00:25:23,819 --> 00:25:29,220
preventative control agents the bacillus

612
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:31,200
sometimes certainly on if you're using

613
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:33,720
for Folia diseases they have a little

614
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:36,179
bit of a Curative property just based on

615
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:38,220
the nature of those products but again

616
00:25:36,179 --> 00:25:39,840
we're ideally talking a preventative

617
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:42,360
game here

618
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:45,959
um so you know bacterial

619
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:48,058
fungal products would would be would be

620
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:52,140
those of choice for me

621
00:25:48,058 --> 00:25:53,940
um in in that uh prevention game I know

622
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:56,000
there are other

623
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:56,000
um

624
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:02,519
streptomyces let's say products which I

625
00:26:00,298 --> 00:26:06,240
think are registered in in some states

626
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:09,058
for use same type of scenario as

627
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:12,120
applying those early in that in that

628
00:26:09,058 --> 00:26:14,519
cropping cycle so they can work as to

629
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:17,819
prevent diseases I should back up a

630
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:20,400
couple of steps Ted and and and

631
00:26:17,819 --> 00:26:22,519
talk about the growing medium itself I

632
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:26,340
mean we we've frequently just talk about

633
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:30,179
dirt or you know potting mixes but

634
00:26:26,339 --> 00:26:33,240
though having a healthy microbial biota

635
00:26:30,179 --> 00:26:35,580
in there as well is is an important part

636
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:38,940
of of I would say crop health so

637
00:26:35,579 --> 00:26:41,158
whatever we can do to promote good

638
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:45,240
microbes versus bad is going to go a

639
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:46,559
long way to help that plant flourish in

640
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,980
that environment because there's a lot

641
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:51,720
of you know plants and microbes have had

642
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:54,058
associations for thousands and well

643
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:56,519
since the beginning I guess

644
00:26:54,058 --> 00:26:59,099
um just like we really could not survive

645
00:26:56,519 --> 00:27:01,379
without microbes so the plants really

646
00:26:59,099 --> 00:27:04,079
can't survive without those microbes

647
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:06,240
either they form a very close

648
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:08,278
associations with them

649
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,980
um certain different microbes have

650
00:27:08,278 --> 00:27:13,019
different functions in soils some are

651
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:14,099
very good some microbes not so good so

652
00:27:13,019 --> 00:27:16,019
we want to

653
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:18,778
try and shift the balance of the soil

654
00:27:16,019 --> 00:27:20,460
and um and I'm in no way shape or form

655
00:27:18,778 --> 00:27:22,200
an expert on this you would be much

656
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:25,620
better positioned to talk about this

657
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:27,720
than I would but I I firmly believe in

658
00:27:25,619 --> 00:27:29,759
you know healthy soils are part of the

659
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:32,700
solution as well

660
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:34,759
um the reason we go then to what are

661
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:39,480
some of the control products we can use

662
00:27:34,759 --> 00:27:41,220
is that you know at a certain point you

663
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:43,798
can do everything correct culturally but

664
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:47,339
the disease pressures are

665
00:27:43,798 --> 00:27:50,639
higher than those cultural practices can

666
00:27:47,339 --> 00:27:52,439
can necessarily prevent that disease

667
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:55,080
taking hold and that's where we're then

668
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:57,120
bringing these additional beneficial

669
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:59,240
microbes to

670
00:27:57,119 --> 00:28:02,099
work within that system

671
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:04,019
to further prevent the disease and and

672
00:28:02,099 --> 00:28:05,759
these are microbes which have been

673
00:28:04,019 --> 00:28:07,519
specifically

674
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:11,720
selected

675
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:15,298
because of their disease

676
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:16,740
suppressive properties let's say so you

677
00:28:15,298 --> 00:28:18,960
know that you know by introducing them

678
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:21,298
they they will perform that that

679
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,819
function

680
00:28:21,298 --> 00:28:25,500
um so that's that's that's a very high

681
00:28:23,819 --> 00:28:26,939
level looking at the soil go ahead you

682
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:29,339
had a question

683
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:31,200
yeah yeah and that that sort of is my

684
00:28:29,339 --> 00:28:31,918
question it is very high level

685
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,159
um

686
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:37,200
when we when you say trichoderma

687
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:40,860
or bacillus like you're acknowledging

688
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:45,360
that that's a a pretty wide range of

689
00:28:40,859 --> 00:28:47,339
actual species and efficacy and then now

690
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:50,158
when we talk about marketing and

691
00:28:47,339 --> 00:28:52,980
products it gets even more confusing and

692
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:55,140
then you add in shelf life and

693
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:57,419
um all these other things and Spore

694
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:59,940
counts where it's I think it's really

695
00:28:57,419 --> 00:29:01,440
hard for the for the cultivator or the

696
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:03,058
end user to really know what's best

697
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,679
because I can go online and find a paper

698
00:29:03,058 --> 00:29:08,099
around your credit trichoderma is

699
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:09,720
suppressing you know various pathogens

700
00:29:08,099 --> 00:29:11,278
but yeah how do I know that the product

701
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:13,558
that I'm buying is going to have any

702
00:29:11,278 --> 00:29:15,900
efficacy whatsoever or what is even the

703
00:29:13,558 --> 00:29:18,538
best product for what I'm dealing with

704
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:21,059
yeah it's a that's a that's a great

705
00:29:18,538 --> 00:29:23,519
great question and how long have we got

706
00:29:21,058 --> 00:29:27,000
we could talk about it for quite a while

707
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:28,918
and be honest you know I I did very high

708
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,898
level just saying trichoderma and just

709
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:33,419
saying bacillus just saying streptomyces

710
00:29:30,898 --> 00:29:36,058
doesn't really mean anything

711
00:29:33,419 --> 00:29:38,159
um I'll pick on trichoderma but you

712
00:29:36,058 --> 00:29:40,379
could say pretty much equally the same

713
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:44,340
for bacillus trichoderma is one of the

714
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:46,620
most widely distributed organisms

715
00:29:44,339 --> 00:29:49,259
throughout the world you know you can

716
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:52,918
find trichoderma fungi in pretty well

717
00:29:49,259 --> 00:29:54,379
every every environment you look for it

718
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:56,880
um

719
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:58,860
they perform different functions

720
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,140
different trichoderma species do

721
00:29:58,859 --> 00:30:03,719
different things so just saying I have a

722
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:06,720
trichoderma does not necessarily mean

723
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:10,919
you have a trichoderma that can suppress

724
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:13,500
a disease similarly simply saying I have

725
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:15,000
a bacillus does not necessarily mean you

726
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,980
have a strain of bacillus or

727
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,240
streptomyces if we're talking bacteria

728
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:23,519
that is capable of suppressing diseases

729
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:26,339
some bacilli perform other functions in

730
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:29,879
the environment as do trichoderma some

731
00:30:26,339 --> 00:30:32,819
workers you know decomposers or they can

732
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:35,880
work together with plants they don't

733
00:30:32,819 --> 00:30:38,700
actually do any Disease Control but they

734
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:41,539
will perhaps solubilize certain certain

735
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:44,399
elements in the soil or pre-digest

736
00:30:41,538 --> 00:30:46,558
organic matter and then make the

737
00:30:44,398 --> 00:30:49,079
products the breakdown products are then

738
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:50,700
made available to the plants so

739
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:54,000
different organisms have different

740
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:56,460
functions inside that whole biota that

741
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,319
we call a living soil if you would like

742
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:59,460
to call it that

743
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:03,418
um

744
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:07,140
if we get to you know what do I look for

745
00:31:03,419 --> 00:31:09,120
now in a Disease Control product I I

746
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:10,740
firmly believe you know

747
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:14,000
that

748
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:17,278
products per se that are

749
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:20,419
registered and that can be registered

750
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:20,419
with the EPA

751
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:26,819
registered with the pmra in Canada

752
00:31:23,898 --> 00:31:27,658
those products have to go through a lot

753
00:31:26,819 --> 00:31:32,460
of

754
00:31:27,659 --> 00:31:36,059
testing and in order to be considered as

755
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:37,679
bio pesticides because if if you make

756
00:31:36,058 --> 00:31:40,798
any

757
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:43,559
disease management claims on a label you

758
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:46,798
it has to be a registered product and in

759
00:31:43,558 --> 00:31:47,579
order to get registered there is a lot

760
00:31:46,798 --> 00:31:48,440
of

761
00:31:47,579 --> 00:31:52,699
um

762
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:55,380
prerequisites in terms of filing a

763
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:58,019
portfolio of data on the safety and

764
00:31:55,380 --> 00:32:01,080
efficacy of those those particular

765
00:31:58,019 --> 00:32:03,179
microbes to the respective regulatory

766
00:32:01,079 --> 00:32:05,220
authorities

767
00:32:03,179 --> 00:32:09,659
so

768
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:12,259
choosing a registered product is I think

769
00:32:09,659 --> 00:32:15,059
one way of

770
00:32:12,259 --> 00:32:17,579
safeguarding you know your investment to

771
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:21,000
some degree that you know what's in that

772
00:32:17,579 --> 00:32:23,579
product it has had to have been tested

773
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:26,819
you know that what is written on the

774
00:32:23,579 --> 00:32:31,199
side of the the bag it says contains

775
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:33,658
1 times 10 to the 7 cfus per gram or 1

776
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,380
times 10 to the 9 per gram whatever it

777
00:32:33,659 --> 00:32:37,140
is

778
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:39,000
if it's a registered product you have to

779
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:41,100
conform to what is written on the label

780
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,519
so that's a guarantee what is written on

781
00:32:41,099 --> 00:32:47,219
the label as a manufacturer the

782
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:49,980
manufacturer has to guarantee that what

783
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:52,740
is in that bag

784
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:56,278
contains what it says it contains on the

785
00:32:52,740 --> 00:33:00,298
label and that means product Purity so

786
00:32:56,278 --> 00:33:03,720
if it said you know contains 1 times 10

787
00:33:00,298 --> 00:33:05,298
to the 7 cfus trichoderma heart CNM at

788
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:08,759
least per gram

789
00:33:05,298 --> 00:33:11,819
that's what it contains and it also

790
00:33:08,759 --> 00:33:15,839
guarantees that there's a a minimal

791
00:33:11,819 --> 00:33:18,298
amount of other microbes in that bag and

792
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:20,778
there are very strict guidelines from

793
00:33:18,298 --> 00:33:23,759
both the EPA and the pmra around

794
00:33:20,778 --> 00:33:26,460
acceptable levels of contaminants and

795
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:28,019
it's very very low so in order to get a

796
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:30,899
product registered you have to go

797
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:32,339
through a lot or or jump across a lot of

798
00:33:30,898 --> 00:33:35,038
hurdles go through a lot of Hoops

799
00:33:32,339 --> 00:33:37,019
however you want to word it in order to

800
00:33:35,038 --> 00:33:40,019
get that product registered but then

801
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:41,940
what it does as I said it sort of is a

802
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:44,399
guarantee for the purchaser of that

803
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:47,220
product that it contains what it says it

804
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:50,038
does and it will do the job that it that

805
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:55,440
is stated on the label unfortunately

806
00:33:50,038 --> 00:33:58,940
there's a lot of unregistered products

807
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,940
which are sold

808
00:33:59,278 --> 00:34:05,579
um

809
00:34:00,259 --> 00:34:06,599
as or plant growth enhancers or

810
00:34:05,579 --> 00:34:08,219
um

811
00:34:06,599 --> 00:34:10,858
I don't know plant growth enhances the

812
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:14,398
best one I can think of right now

813
00:34:10,858 --> 00:34:17,779
that may or may not contain the microbes

814
00:34:14,398 --> 00:34:20,699
that it says on the sheet or may contain

815
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:22,560
significantly fewer microbes that it

816
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:24,178
says in in the literature that you might

817
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:25,799
accompany the product

818
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:28,800
so

819
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:31,019
just because it a package says it

820
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:33,599
contains a product doesn't mean it's

821
00:34:31,019 --> 00:34:35,219
actually living it doesn't mean it's

822
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:39,059
actually contains spores of that product

823
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:40,699
at all and tests that I know you're

824
00:34:39,059 --> 00:34:43,259
you're familiar with some of the work

825
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:45,598
that that I've been involved in

826
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:48,659
previously is looking at some of these

827
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:50,820
sort of unregistered materials and it's

828
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:53,579
quite scary actually what you find

829
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:56,039
inside them it's also quite scary the

830
00:34:53,579 --> 00:34:57,838
flip side that it says it contains you

831
00:34:56,039 --> 00:35:00,239
know

832
00:34:57,838 --> 00:35:01,440
um 10 to the 7 of a specific fungus

833
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:04,019
let's say and it actually doesn't

834
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:06,300
contain anything that's living inside it

835
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:08,820
at all so you you think you're on a good

836
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:10,680
thing it contains trichoderma that's

837
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:13,380
good right no I understand that there's

838
00:35:10,679 --> 00:35:15,179
a there is a there is a reason why

839
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:17,099
certain strains have been commercialized

840
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:19,858
and it's not just any old trichoderma or

841
00:35:17,099 --> 00:35:21,660
bacillus or streptomyces that goes into

842
00:35:19,858 --> 00:35:24,059
a commercial product they have to have

843
00:35:21,659 --> 00:35:27,598
met certain performance standards they

844
00:35:24,059 --> 00:35:30,838
have to have men met certain production

845
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:34,920
standards in terms of uh producing that

846
00:35:30,838 --> 00:35:36,599
consistent level of the microbe that

847
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,858
goes into that product The Jug of the

848
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:39,838
bag

849
00:35:37,858 --> 00:35:42,900
um and there's a certain safety

850
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:44,599
associated with that product as well it

851
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:47,820
I've I've

852
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:49,320
seen examine products and some of the

853
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:51,780
organisms that come out of them are

854
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:55,140
actually things like aspergillus

855
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:58,500
penicillium now certain aspergillus can

856
00:35:55,139 --> 00:36:00,118
be very that human pathogens you really

857
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:02,338
don't want to be spraying that into your

858
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:04,920
crop when you specially when you're

859
00:36:02,338 --> 00:36:06,358
talking a crop like like cannabis you

860
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,320
know if you think I'm I'm doing a good

861
00:36:06,358 --> 00:36:09,420
thing here

862
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:12,000
and you're spraying on penicillium or

863
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:12,838
aspergillus I mean that's a that's a

864
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,440
real

865
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:15,299
um

866
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,400
you're setting yourself up for failure

867
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:20,400
when when that when those those flowers

868
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:21,838
go for the sort of total yield uh yeast

869
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,460
and mold counts you know because you're

870
00:36:21,838 --> 00:36:25,380
just putting

871
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:27,720
um spoilage microbes contaminant

872
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:29,220
microbes out in the crops so

873
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:31,319
I told you it'd probably take a good

874
00:36:29,219 --> 00:36:34,139
hour to talk this one properly through

875
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:36,720
but there are risks associated with just

876
00:36:34,139 --> 00:36:39,000
buying any product so it really is

877
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:41,098
inherent upon the

878
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,380
buyer to do a little bit of homework

879
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:45,660
around the product and make sure what

880
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:49,200
you're buying has has

881
00:36:45,659 --> 00:36:51,659
is registered as a good track record and

882
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:53,159
if in doubt you know if somebody knocks

883
00:36:51,659 --> 00:36:55,440
on your door says hey I've got this best

884
00:36:53,159 --> 00:36:58,259
thing in some unmarked bags out here you

885
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:01,440
want to try it always always ask to see

886
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:02,760
some data sort of supporting

887
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,920
um

888
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:06,660
supporting the sort of the claims that

889
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:08,760
are being made on the label or by the

890
00:37:06,659 --> 00:37:11,399
person selling that product

891
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:13,140
um and that oftentimes sorts out the

892
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,639
good the good from the bad or the wheat

893
00:37:13,139 --> 00:37:17,338
from the chaff depending on how you want

894
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:21,900
to you want to phrase it but uh

895
00:37:17,338 --> 00:37:22,799
um it is hard to navigate sometimes and

896
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:25,559
um

897
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:27,660
it really is inherent upon the

898
00:37:25,559 --> 00:37:29,940
individual I think to do a little bit of

899
00:37:27,659 --> 00:37:31,440
uh do a little bit of checking and if in

900
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:33,599
doubt you know call the companies and

901
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:36,980
ask for the ask ask for some of these

902
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:36,980
details we've just discussed

903
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:41,579
yeah I know this was a pretty Hot Topic

904
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:42,900
at the latest biosolutions conference

905
00:37:41,579 --> 00:37:43,740
because

906
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:45,960
um

907
00:37:43,739 --> 00:37:48,379
as the industry is trying to gain

908
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:51,059
legitimacy for

909
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:53,880
biofungicides for biostimulants all of

910
00:37:51,059 --> 00:37:55,920
you know using microbes commercially in

911
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:58,320
agriculture you have all these products

912
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:01,619
out there that are essentially either

913
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:04,380
ineffective or making wrong claims or

914
00:38:01,619 --> 00:38:06,119
skirting registration and that are you

915
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:09,300
know painting a bad name for the

916
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:11,880
industry and correct me if I'm wrong I

917
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:14,240
believe uh Suzanne got a sample from one

918
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:16,858
of the largest uh

919
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:18,838
companies in my part of the living soil

920
00:38:16,858 --> 00:38:21,179
portion industry I think it was Bavaria

921
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:24,358
and you you tested it and found it

922
00:38:21,179 --> 00:38:26,219
didn't contain enough spores to have any

923
00:38:24,358 --> 00:38:27,659
efficacy is that

924
00:38:26,219 --> 00:38:30,358
does that sound right that's absolutely

925
00:38:27,659 --> 00:38:32,460
correct yeah and another sample we

926
00:38:30,358 --> 00:38:35,098
actually found no living Bavaria in the

927
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:37,980
product at all and with

928
00:38:35,099 --> 00:38:40,500
pretty particular about how we how we

929
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:42,059
ran these tests as well and you know you

930
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:44,639
run a test once

931
00:38:42,059 --> 00:38:46,619
and nothing shows up you you always

932
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:49,078
doubt the results so you make sure you

933
00:38:46,619 --> 00:38:51,900
run it again and then run it a third

934
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:54,119
time just to just to triple check the

935
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:56,400
validity of the data that you get so

936
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:58,700
yeah it wasn't just a fluke

937
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:01,200
um it was true so yeah I mean these are

938
00:38:58,699 --> 00:39:03,239
Suzanne found the sample we we did the

939
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:05,639
testing for her and found nothing in it

940
00:39:03,239 --> 00:39:07,078
oh nothing in it of value let's put it

941
00:39:05,639 --> 00:39:09,539
that way

942
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:11,039
yeah yeah that's crazy and then

943
00:39:09,539 --> 00:39:12,719
um but yeah if you went on the reviews

944
00:39:11,039 --> 00:39:14,940
for that product on the product page

945
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:16,500
you'd see positive reviews and you'd see

946
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:18,599
on Instagram a lot of reviews that are

947
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:20,219
positive but yet the efficacy isn't

948
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:21,599
there so that's I think that's amazing

949
00:39:20,219 --> 00:39:24,000
and that's where we have to separate out

950
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:25,980
actual like science and data from

951
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,838
marketing

952
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:30,599
um you also I had heard found another

953
00:39:27,838 --> 00:39:32,639
product that had on their label and I

954
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:34,440
believe it was bavari again levels so

955
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:37,199
high that it wasn't

956
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:40,200
it wasn't physically physiologically

957
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:43,739
possible to have that sort of volume

958
00:39:40,199 --> 00:39:45,899
in yeah or sport count and of all in the

959
00:39:43,739 --> 00:39:49,439
amount of volume I'm saying that's right

960
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:51,300
it was a it was a it was a mix of

961
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,980
microbes and if if it contained

962
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:54,780
everything that it said on the label you

963
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:57,059
could not fit all of those spores into a

964
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:59,780
gram it was just physically impossible

965
00:39:57,059 --> 00:40:03,659
but but again the claim was there

966
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:06,780
and we indeed tested it and I think the

967
00:40:03,659 --> 00:40:10,019
claim was there's something like a

968
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:13,859
10 billion or 100 billion scores per per

969
00:40:10,019 --> 00:40:16,380
gram I think it was and we we

970
00:40:13,858 --> 00:40:18,539
got some samples plated them did the

971
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:21,900
counts and then you do the math and

972
00:40:18,539 --> 00:40:26,000
there was you know something like a

973
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:27,619
10 000 times less lower level of

974
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,780
organisms

975
00:40:27,619 --> 00:40:32,400
the only things that we could get out of

976
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:36,119
it were

977
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:38,639
um bacteria so presumably a bacillus we

978
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:40,858
found no no fungi in the in the product

979
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:42,598
at all I mean you know we we throw

980
00:40:40,858 --> 00:40:44,940
things the word we throw words around

981
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:47,099
like penicillium and fusarium and we

982
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:48,900
think they're all bad in actual fat

983
00:40:47,099 --> 00:40:51,359
that's not the case you know

984
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:54,900
um just to clarify this or or get it on

985
00:40:51,358 --> 00:40:57,719
the record I'd say you know 95 percent

986
00:40:54,900 --> 00:41:00,480
of the uh penicillium and fusarium

987
00:40:57,719 --> 00:41:04,338
strains you find in in a typical soil

988
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:08,039
sample are actually very very beneficial

989
00:41:04,338 --> 00:41:10,338
and in fact some I know some some

990
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:12,480
penicillium strains have have been

991
00:41:10,338 --> 00:41:15,358
commercialized because they actually

992
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:17,280
solubilize soil nutrients very very

993
00:41:15,358 --> 00:41:19,799
efficiently and can make them more

994
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:22,260
available to the plant so

995
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:23,880
um again it's just just saying

996
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:25,980
penicillium or fusarium doesn't doesn't

997
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:27,900
hold a lot and this kind of gets back to

998
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:30,780
an earlier question that it's important

999
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:33,660
to know the species because some species

1000
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:36,119
even though it has that genus fusarium

1001
00:41:33,659 --> 00:41:38,338
or penicillium the actual species can be

1002
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:40,440
totally harmless so

1003
00:41:38,338 --> 00:41:43,980
um but again back back to this question

1004
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:46,619
yeah I mean it's ridiculous what people

1005
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:51,240
put on the side of a side of a label

1006
00:41:46,619 --> 00:41:54,300
sometimes and and I I question why

1007
00:41:51,239 --> 00:41:56,459
put so many organisms in there because

1008
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:57,980
many of the organisms do exactly the

1009
00:41:56,460 --> 00:42:01,019
same thing

1010
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:04,260
many of those organisms live in exactly

1011
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:06,239
the same niches either or on the plant

1012
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:07,579
route or close to the plant root or in

1013
00:42:06,239 --> 00:42:10,259
the soil

1014
00:42:07,579 --> 00:42:13,619
they don't all

1015
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:16,079
colonize at the same time at the same

1016
00:42:13,619 --> 00:42:19,619
rate so you know all soils are different

1017
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:21,720
soils are very dynamic they will evolve

1018
00:42:19,619 --> 00:42:24,300
through the life of a crop so what's

1019
00:42:21,719 --> 00:42:26,459
what microbe is predominant today may

1020
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:28,440
not be the predominant microbe tomorrow

1021
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,980
so

1022
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:32,400
um

1023
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:34,199
I don't know I I sometimes question the

1024
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:36,960
value of putting you know 20 different

1025
00:42:34,199 --> 00:42:38,819
microbes in a mix unless they're just

1026
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,559
trying to cover all the bases I I I

1027
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:42,180
don't know

1028
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:43,259
um and especially as you know some of

1029
00:42:42,179 --> 00:42:45,480
the

1030
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:47,520
functions that those microbes have will

1031
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,780
only really happen if those microbes

1032
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:51,358
establish

1033
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:53,280
and form a an association at a certain

1034
00:42:51,358 --> 00:42:56,219
level and by certain level I mean the

1035
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:58,079
microbial population size has to be at a

1036
00:42:56,219 --> 00:43:01,379
certain level to actually do any good so

1037
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:03,720
yeah it's a it's a very gray area I 100

1038
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:05,760
agree with you there are some excellent

1039
00:43:03,719 --> 00:43:08,338
products out there microbial products

1040
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:10,319
out there really really excellent there

1041
00:43:08,338 --> 00:43:12,659
are some excellent biostimulants out

1042
00:43:10,318 --> 00:43:14,460
there but for every good one you have I

1043
00:43:12,659 --> 00:43:16,199
would say there's probably

1044
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:18,539
two or three

1045
00:43:16,199 --> 00:43:21,059
dubious ones

1046
00:43:18,539 --> 00:43:24,019
um which which sound great but don't

1047
00:43:21,059 --> 00:43:24,019
actually do a whole lot

1048
00:43:24,539 --> 00:43:28,739
yeah and when you say registered I want

1049
00:43:27,059 --> 00:43:32,338
to just make sure people realize that's

1050
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:34,139
EPA registration not State registration

1051
00:43:32,338 --> 00:43:36,380
um there's a big difference there in

1052
00:43:34,139 --> 00:43:36,379
terms

1053
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:42,839
yeah I was gonna say if I wanted to

1054
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:45,119
register a product in Washington state

1055
00:43:42,838 --> 00:43:46,858
or Oregon or California for example

1056
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:50,280
that's very easy process I don't have to

1057
00:43:46,858 --> 00:43:52,318
show any efficacy especially you know I

1058
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:55,079
don't know if 25b applies to microbes

1059
00:43:52,318 --> 00:43:56,699
I'd have to check on it well it yes it's

1060
00:43:55,079 --> 00:43:57,900
a little more complex than that most of

1061
00:43:56,699 --> 00:44:00,598
the states

1062
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:04,019
will only register products if they have

1063
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:05,039
EPA registration now this is products

1064
00:44:04,019 --> 00:44:08,519
making

1065
00:44:05,039 --> 00:44:11,219
pesticide claims hmm

1066
00:44:08,519 --> 00:44:13,920
okay but if you don't make any claims

1067
00:44:11,219 --> 00:44:16,739
around it then you're okay if you don't

1068
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:18,300
make any claims you can probably go in

1069
00:44:16,739 --> 00:44:21,659
and you still have to get State

1070
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:24,180
registration yeah 25 B's are a great

1071
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:27,139
example I think and that

1072
00:44:24,179 --> 00:44:29,960
people look at 25 bees as as

1073
00:44:27,139 --> 00:44:34,259
unregistered products well they're not

1074
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:37,619
they are actually EPA approved because

1075
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:40,260
the EPA says we're categorizing this as

1076
00:44:37,619 --> 00:44:43,980
a 25 B Because based on the information

1077
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:46,040
we have we don't think it poses any any

1078
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:50,280
risk to the environment

1079
00:44:46,039 --> 00:44:54,019
or to human animal or plant Health

1080
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:57,300
therefore you do not need to go through

1081
00:44:54,019 --> 00:45:00,239
a lot of the EPA regulatory requirements

1082
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:03,480
to you to get that product approved for

1083
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:05,578
use so it's categorized as 25b which is

1084
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:08,280
an EPA categorization

1085
00:45:05,579 --> 00:45:09,960
now those still have to be registered at

1086
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:12,300
the state level so there is a certain

1087
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:14,220
level of responsibility and

1088
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:16,500
accountability in order to get that

1089
00:45:14,219 --> 00:45:17,578
product approved for use at the state

1090
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:20,159
level

1091
00:45:17,579 --> 00:45:23,039
cannabis then typically has an

1092
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:24,838
additional layer of requirements to go

1093
00:45:23,039 --> 00:45:28,380
through to get products approved for use

1094
00:45:24,838 --> 00:45:30,779
on cannabis so it is a process

1095
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:32,880
and and that process will differ

1096
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:35,579
depending on as you rightly said the

1097
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:38,099
claims that are being made on on the

1098
00:45:35,579 --> 00:45:39,780
material you know if if you're not

1099
00:45:38,099 --> 00:45:42,300
claiming any um

1100
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:44,780
pest or disease management not making

1101
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:47,400
any pest or disease management claims

1102
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:50,160
then but you're registering it for the

1103
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:53,180
plant benefit claims then it's it's a

1104
00:45:50,159 --> 00:45:53,179
different process altogether

1105
00:45:53,219 --> 00:45:57,959
yeah and I get emails all the time time

1106
00:45:55,260 --> 00:46:00,240
from uh Chinese companies that are

1107
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:01,858
selling various species of bacillus and

1108
00:46:00,239 --> 00:46:04,078
trichoderma and all of this like I could

1109
00:46:01,858 --> 00:46:08,699
I could very easily today

1110
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:11,460
go online make a mix and sell it without

1111
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:13,559
having any efficacy data showing that

1112
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:14,940
one that's actually what I'm saying is

1113
00:46:13,559 --> 00:46:17,818
in the product is in the product or two

1114
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:19,019
that it even works but it that's what I

1115
00:46:17,818 --> 00:46:20,818
think a lot of companies do

1116
00:46:19,019 --> 00:46:23,338
unfortunately

1117
00:46:20,818 --> 00:46:24,900
yeah you're absolutely right and I you

1118
00:46:23,338 --> 00:46:26,880
know this was another

1119
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:29,099
product that Suzanne

1120
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:31,200
um found and it was being sold I think

1121
00:46:29,099 --> 00:46:33,059
on

1122
00:46:31,199 --> 00:46:35,279
Etsy or something like that or you know

1123
00:46:33,059 --> 00:46:38,338
you can get these products on Amazon and

1124
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:41,579
Etsy and goodness knows where else

1125
00:46:38,338 --> 00:46:44,960
um she sent us a sample it was it was

1126
00:46:41,579 --> 00:46:47,280
supposedly a a meter Museum product now

1127
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:51,960
materism is

1128
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:53,940
typically a Associated as a with insects

1129
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:55,079
it's a it's an insect control fungus and

1130
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:56,639
there's again there's some great

1131
00:46:55,079 --> 00:46:58,380
products out there

1132
00:46:56,639 --> 00:46:59,420
but

1133
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:03,440
um

1134
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:07,500
these barrels of materism I think it was

1135
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:11,099
anisopley was apparently coming in and

1136
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:13,260
very cheap very cheap sold in from China

1137
00:47:11,099 --> 00:47:14,280
um we got a sample and again it was one

1138
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:16,440
of those

1139
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:19,980
products we tested there was absolutely

1140
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:23,880
no no living matterism in the product

1141
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:25,260
or in that in that material I I hesitate

1142
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:27,420
to use the word product because it

1143
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:29,400
really wasn't

1144
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:32,940
and you have to think as well there's a

1145
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:33,900
lot more goes into a bag of product than

1146
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:37,139
just

1147
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:39,720
spores there's a whole lot of

1148
00:47:37,139 --> 00:47:42,179
stabilization which keep those spores

1149
00:47:39,719 --> 00:47:43,679
alive over time that's kind of relates

1150
00:47:42,179 --> 00:47:46,199
to your earlier question about shelf

1151
00:47:43,679 --> 00:47:48,500
life so the way in which those spores

1152
00:47:46,199 --> 00:47:51,960
are preserved and formulated

1153
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:53,460
affects how stable they are and and how

1154
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:55,920
long they will remain alive and

1155
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:57,358
therefore effective when you when you

1156
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:58,920
store them either in the fridge or at

1157
00:47:57,358 --> 00:48:01,338
room temperature

1158
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:04,800
any formulation

1159
00:48:01,338 --> 00:48:07,679
back up on that one formulations often

1160
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:09,060
as well contain additional materials

1161
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:13,199
which help

1162
00:48:09,059 --> 00:48:15,420
the grower then put that material if

1163
00:48:13,199 --> 00:48:17,460
it's a microbial putting it into the

1164
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:18,960
spray tank or into the into this where

1165
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:21,000
however the whatever they're using

1166
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:23,099
whatever equipment they're using it

1167
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:26,400
helps that process of of getting those

1168
00:48:23,099 --> 00:48:29,099
spores into suspension and then it helps

1169
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:31,380
them stay in suspension and it helps

1170
00:48:29,099 --> 00:48:33,599
that product when it actually gets onto

1171
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:35,960
the leaf or targets the pest it'll help

1172
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:38,640
it work better and remain

1173
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:41,099
effective for longer in that environment

1174
00:48:38,639 --> 00:48:43,019
so there's a lot more to a product than

1175
00:48:41,099 --> 00:48:44,280
just say getting a bag full of spores

1176
00:48:43,019 --> 00:48:46,159
from somewhere

1177
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:50,280
um

1178
00:48:46,159 --> 00:48:52,799
again that's why registered registered

1179
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:55,800
products have have made the investment

1180
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:58,500
in in coming up with a formulation that

1181
00:48:55,800 --> 00:49:00,839
is stable that will preserve the

1182
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:04,079
viability of those microbes and and will

1183
00:49:00,838 --> 00:49:06,739
help uh at the application end in terms

1184
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:10,740
of preparation and application and and

1185
00:49:06,739 --> 00:49:12,779
oftentimes improve efficacy as well so

1186
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:14,699
yeah there's a lot there's a lot we

1187
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:15,839
could talk about in this whole area for

1188
00:49:14,699 --> 00:49:17,639
sure

1189
00:49:15,838 --> 00:49:19,559
well and I would just add you know that

1190
00:49:17,639 --> 00:49:21,838
they're going to be clean to or cleaner

1191
00:49:19,559 --> 00:49:23,818
in terms of heavy metal contaminants and

1192
00:49:21,838 --> 00:49:26,460
things like that that could also

1193
00:49:23,818 --> 00:49:30,239
cause issues especially in Kansas well

1194
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:32,159
yeah yeah and we have to conform to uh

1195
00:49:30,239 --> 00:49:34,739
again that's one of the requirements of

1196
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:37,379
any registered products that you you I

1197
00:49:34,739 --> 00:49:39,299
mentioned the contaminants I was kind of

1198
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:41,579
referring to microbial contaminants but

1199
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:43,740
it but it also applies to

1200
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:49,680
um heavy metals as well you know you

1201
00:49:43,739 --> 00:49:52,979
have to fall under EPA prescribed levels

1202
00:49:49,679 --> 00:49:55,019
of any heavy metals in any product so

1203
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:57,240
that's also another guarantee that

1204
00:49:55,019 --> 00:49:58,980
around heavy metals if it's coming from

1205
00:49:57,239 --> 00:50:01,919
offshore and they're making claims on it

1206
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:04,519
number one it's actually illegal to use

1207
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:07,680
it because it's not registered

1208
00:50:04,519 --> 00:50:10,619
and number two you have no idea what you

1209
00:50:07,679 --> 00:50:12,598
buy you really don't

1210
00:50:10,619 --> 00:50:14,039
yeah the problem with that though is

1211
00:50:12,599 --> 00:50:16,200
like um

1212
00:50:14,039 --> 00:50:18,599
unfortunately there's a lot of companies

1213
00:50:16,199 --> 00:50:21,118
again a lot of the companies that I that

1214
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:22,500
do quite well and sell you know millions

1215
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:24,420
of dollars worth of product every year

1216
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:26,760
that have not gone through the step of

1217
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:29,579
registering their product and you know I

1218
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:30,660
do I do blame them but I also kind of

1219
00:50:29,579 --> 00:50:33,180
blame

1220
00:50:30,659 --> 00:50:35,039
this one the states were making it so

1221
00:50:33,179 --> 00:50:38,639
difficult to have to register in 50

1222
00:50:35,039 --> 00:50:39,779
states is frankly stupid I think um we

1223
00:50:38,639 --> 00:50:42,179
should have some sort of federal

1224
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:43,319
registration but

1225
00:50:42,179 --> 00:50:45,059
um there's there's no really

1226
00:50:43,318 --> 00:50:45,960
accountability like in the state of

1227
00:50:45,059 --> 00:50:47,759
Oregon

1228
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:50,579
you know you have companies that will

1229
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:51,839
continually not register or their

1230
00:50:50,579 --> 00:50:54,660
products don't contain what they claim

1231
00:50:51,838 --> 00:50:56,759
they do and they might pay 150 fine or a

1232
00:50:54,659 --> 00:50:58,739
thousand dollar fine well yeah you know

1233
00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:01,440
if you're doing 10 million dollars in

1234
00:50:58,739 --> 00:51:04,519
that state do you really care like it's

1235
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:07,740
not the financial incentive is not there

1236
00:51:04,519 --> 00:51:09,539
uh I think to discourage or eliminate a

1237
00:51:07,739 --> 00:51:12,000
lot of these a lot of these products

1238
00:51:09,539 --> 00:51:14,099
either because like on my side you know

1239
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,500
in the living soil industry one of my

1240
00:51:14,099 --> 00:51:18,180
one of my biggest competitors has done

1241
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:19,980
gone by without registering for years

1242
00:51:18,179 --> 00:51:21,719
and is now just starting to register

1243
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:22,800
their products even though they've known

1244
00:51:21,719 --> 00:51:25,078
that this is something that you're

1245
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:27,599
supposed to do there's no incentive to

1246
00:51:25,079 --> 00:51:29,220
do it because it costs money it requires

1247
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:30,440
more regulation

1248
00:51:29,219 --> 00:51:34,019
um

1249
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:37,858
it's yeah it's a frustrating topic for

1250
00:51:34,019 --> 00:51:40,679
me it is I I couldn't agree more with

1251
00:51:37,858 --> 00:51:42,900
you it is it is frustrating but and and

1252
00:51:40,679 --> 00:51:45,000
yeah if it's cheaper to pay the fine

1253
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:46,858
then actually pay the registration costs

1254
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,300
not just the registration costs but you

1255
00:51:46,858 --> 00:51:50,519
have to have data

1256
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:55,318
you know which is a cost

1257
00:51:50,519 --> 00:51:58,619
um and time so yeah frustrating but uh

1258
00:51:55,318 --> 00:52:01,858
I I tend to think that or I would like

1259
00:51:58,619 --> 00:52:05,099
to think in an Ideal World

1260
00:52:01,858 --> 00:52:08,039
um registration means something

1261
00:52:05,099 --> 00:52:11,099
um we need to get a little bit smarter

1262
00:52:08,039 --> 00:52:13,679
perhaps about the processes required to

1263
00:52:11,099 --> 00:52:16,859
register a product and having one

1264
00:52:13,679 --> 00:52:19,139
Federal registration would be ideal you

1265
00:52:16,858 --> 00:52:21,739
know it would save a heck of a lot of

1266
00:52:19,139 --> 00:52:26,480
time and time and energy

1267
00:52:21,739 --> 00:52:29,039
and you know I I think again it

1268
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:30,719
you know registered products it can be

1269
00:52:29,039 --> 00:52:32,159
registered and still not work because

1270
00:52:30,719 --> 00:52:34,500
there are a whole lot of other factors

1271
00:52:32,159 --> 00:52:37,440
around making a product work effectively

1272
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:40,079
when you apply it but but at least you

1273
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:41,760
know what you're buying is what it says

1274
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:43,859
it is and has a good chance of doing

1275
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:46,440
what it what it says it will do what it

1276
00:52:43,858 --> 00:52:49,440
says or what the what the the vendor

1277
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:52,519
promises it will do so

1278
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:55,980
um I'd like to think it was

1279
00:52:52,519 --> 00:52:57,838
again it's incumbent upon people to to

1280
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:59,519
really

1281
00:52:57,838 --> 00:53:01,500
take a look at what they're buying and

1282
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:03,719
are you are you getting value for money

1283
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:05,940
there are you getting are you sure the

1284
00:53:03,719 --> 00:53:07,259
product's doing what what it what it

1285
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:09,659
what is

1286
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:11,460
said on the label or advertising

1287
00:53:09,659 --> 00:53:14,219
literature is it doing what it says it

1288
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:16,440
does and how do you know that

1289
00:53:14,219 --> 00:53:18,118
I I

1290
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:20,700
it's always an interesting com

1291
00:53:18,119 --> 00:53:22,619
conversation to have with how do you

1292
00:53:20,699 --> 00:53:26,159
know the products worked

1293
00:53:22,619 --> 00:53:27,720
uh because things look Greener okay is

1294
00:53:26,159 --> 00:53:30,358
that a true measure

1295
00:53:27,719 --> 00:53:34,139
and I just I'm being somewhat flippant

1296
00:53:30,358 --> 00:53:36,299
there but I think having a a good idea

1297
00:53:34,139 --> 00:53:38,578
in your own mind

1298
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:40,740
um what does success look like if I use

1299
00:53:38,579 --> 00:53:43,260
this product

1300
00:53:40,739 --> 00:53:45,959
what am I what do I want this product to

1301
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:49,680
do number one and how will I be able to

1302
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:52,858
measure that to sort of say

1303
00:53:49,679 --> 00:53:55,019
pretty done uh equivocally that that the

1304
00:53:52,858 --> 00:53:56,880
product's done you know what I wanted it

1305
00:53:55,019 --> 00:53:59,539
to do so

1306
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:02,940
it's not always easy to do either yeah

1307
00:53:59,539 --> 00:54:05,219
it isn't and and on the flip side like I

1308
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:06,000
I at this conference that we were both

1309
00:54:05,219 --> 00:54:08,039
at

1310
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,780
um there were companies you know

1311
00:54:08,039 --> 00:54:12,480
including bioworks it's like I have this

1312
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:14,280
product it's coming you know and you're

1313
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:15,900
not talking about a matter of days and

1314
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:18,059
weeks it's it's more on the scale of

1315
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:19,858
months a year because or years because

1316
00:54:18,059 --> 00:54:21,720
of the amount of research that has to go

1317
00:54:19,858 --> 00:54:23,279
into it and then not just that research

1318
00:54:21,719 --> 00:54:25,078
but then

1319
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:27,000
um you know the registration process in

1320
00:54:25,079 --> 00:54:28,440
all these states so even once you have

1321
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,358
the data there's still that waiting

1322
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:31,740
period and that that to me is one of the

1323
00:54:30,358 --> 00:54:34,019
most frustrating things about the

1324
00:54:31,739 --> 00:54:35,879
regulatory process is that you know

1325
00:54:34,019 --> 00:54:38,159
you've got it you've got this product

1326
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:40,318
that you have a solution

1327
00:54:38,159 --> 00:54:43,259
um and you just can't get it out there

1328
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:44,940
but I still I'm fully supportive of

1329
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:46,800
Regulation

1330
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:49,019
um you know for me I almost equate it to

1331
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:50,280
like the pharmaceutical industry like

1332
00:54:49,019 --> 00:54:53,579
you're not going to go get your

1333
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:56,220
antibiotics from the the farmer's market

1334
00:54:53,579 --> 00:54:57,480
or the guy in the alley if you want them

1335
00:54:56,219 --> 00:54:58,858
to act know that they're actually going

1336
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:00,539
to work you know right like you go to

1337
00:54:58,858 --> 00:55:02,039
the doctor absolutely and that's the

1338
00:55:00,539 --> 00:55:04,139
difference absolutely that's literally

1339
00:55:02,039 --> 00:55:05,338
the difference it's that extreme almost

1340
00:55:04,139 --> 00:55:07,739
between

1341
00:55:05,338 --> 00:55:09,058
regulated products and the unregulated

1342
00:55:07,739 --> 00:55:11,279
products

1343
00:55:09,059 --> 00:55:13,079
yeah yeah I couldn't agree more and it

1344
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:15,180
you know

1345
00:55:13,079 --> 00:55:17,640
putting my company hat on now I mean it

1346
00:55:15,179 --> 00:55:19,818
is very frust frustrating at times the

1347
00:55:17,639 --> 00:55:23,039
amount of time it does take from

1348
00:55:19,818 --> 00:55:26,699
submission of a registration package to

1349
00:55:23,039 --> 00:55:27,358
actual approval you know it does take

1350
00:55:26,699 --> 00:55:29,578
um

1351
00:55:27,358 --> 00:55:31,739
months to years for that to happen and

1352
00:55:29,579 --> 00:55:33,539
it's a shame we we haven't figured out

1353
00:55:31,739 --> 00:55:37,519
to make things move along faster there

1354
00:55:33,539 --> 00:55:37,519
but oh well

1355
00:55:38,599 --> 00:55:42,660
to go through the same system

1356
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:45,300
unfortunately

1357
00:55:42,659 --> 00:55:47,399
yeah no I appreciate that I had one last

1358
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:50,300
thing I kind of wanted to touch on

1359
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:53,639
um you and I started this conversation

1360
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:55,140
uh in Reno at the conference talking

1361
00:55:53,639 --> 00:55:58,980
about

1362
00:55:55,139 --> 00:56:01,618
and it's a complex topic this idea of in

1363
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:04,858
soils or you know in my case with living

1364
00:56:01,619 --> 00:56:07,740
soils so soilless media that we're

1365
00:56:04,858 --> 00:56:11,159
reusing and treating like soils we have

1366
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:13,578
we have this microbial Consortium

1367
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:18,000
that's constantly

1368
00:56:13,579 --> 00:56:19,740
co-evolving with our cannabis plants and

1369
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,719
changing

1370
00:56:19,739 --> 00:56:23,879
um

1371
00:56:20,719 --> 00:56:26,338
uh what are your thoughts around how do

1372
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:28,079
we ever really fully understand this

1373
00:56:26,338 --> 00:56:30,239
process

1374
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:33,000
um or or can we ever really fully

1375
00:56:30,239 --> 00:56:35,519
quantify or understand it

1376
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:37,679
golly what a question

1377
00:56:35,519 --> 00:56:40,579
this is this is Nobel Prize stuff if we

1378
00:56:37,679 --> 00:56:43,699
answer this one Todd you know

1379
00:56:40,579 --> 00:56:43,700
I think

1380
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:52,159
for sure you know

1381
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:52,160
plants

1382
00:56:52,318 --> 00:56:57,058
don't stay the same of course throughout

1383
00:56:55,739 --> 00:57:01,500
their life and

1384
00:56:57,059 --> 00:57:04,019
at certain times of that plant growth

1385
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:06,800
those roots if we're talking about soil

1386
00:57:04,019 --> 00:57:10,519
specifically those roots will

1387
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:14,519
exude different compounds

1388
00:57:10,519 --> 00:57:16,440
and some of those compounds like sugars

1389
00:57:14,519 --> 00:57:17,239
favor

1390
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:20,760
um

1391
00:57:17,239 --> 00:57:23,939
Association of certain microbes

1392
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:26,819
certain sugars certain microbes

1393
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:28,980
um sometimes when plants are stressed

1394
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:32,338
for example they will put out different

1395
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:34,318
chemicals to try and recruit in other

1396
00:57:32,338 --> 00:57:36,119
microbes

1397
00:57:34,318 --> 00:57:38,099
at other times the plant's development

1398
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:40,858
you know as it gets older again those

1399
00:57:38,099 --> 00:57:42,900
those exudates will change slightly and

1400
00:57:40,858 --> 00:57:45,838
the microbial population in and around

1401
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:48,838
that soil will change slightly I think

1402
00:57:45,838 --> 00:57:50,400
if it's a true living soil as well you

1403
00:57:48,838 --> 00:57:53,818
have to understand that the soil itself

1404
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:55,619
is constantly changing let alone what's

1405
00:57:53,818 --> 00:57:57,420
going on with the plant but the soil

1406
00:57:55,619 --> 00:57:58,318
itself will be changing because there's

1407
00:57:57,420 --> 00:58:00,119
always

1408
00:57:58,318 --> 00:58:02,279
organic matter which is in different

1409
00:58:00,119 --> 00:58:03,720
states of Decay inside the soil and

1410
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:05,640
there's different successions of

1411
00:58:03,719 --> 00:58:07,939
microbes will come in and take advantage

1412
00:58:05,639 --> 00:58:10,199
of certain elements

1413
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:12,960
that are released from that organic

1414
00:58:10,199 --> 00:58:15,598
material over time so it is a constantly

1415
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:18,300
evolving and changing microbial

1416
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:20,519
landscape in there will we ever fully

1417
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:22,400
understand it good question but you know

1418
00:58:20,519 --> 00:58:25,079
I think

1419
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:27,838
we can

1420
00:58:25,079 --> 00:58:30,960
understand it to a point

1421
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:33,299
um and maybe's

1422
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:35,880
by having certain microbes in a certain

1423
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:38,460
place at a certain time God it's it's

1424
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:39,780
difficult to sort of say because the

1425
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:42,179
plant needs

1426
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:44,519
some microbes at some time other

1427
00:58:42,179 --> 00:58:46,858
microbes at other times how do we how do

1428
00:58:44,519 --> 00:58:49,199
we try and ensure that those microbes

1429
00:58:46,858 --> 00:58:51,598
are present as and when the plant needs

1430
00:58:49,199 --> 00:58:53,639
it so I haven't answered your question

1431
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:55,920
at all I've danced around it very very

1432
00:58:53,639 --> 00:58:57,659
neatly but I don't think there's an

1433
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:58,980
answer per se to it that I can come up

1434
00:58:57,659 --> 00:59:02,219
with I think

1435
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:04,199
we will over time develop a better

1436
00:59:02,219 --> 00:59:05,939
understanding of what goes on in the

1437
00:59:04,199 --> 00:59:08,219
soil and I think that's what

1438
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:10,260
some of these

1439
00:59:08,219 --> 00:59:13,259
studies I've done you know where they're

1440
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:15,000
using these wonderful micro arrays to

1441
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:16,160
identify

1442
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:21,059
different

1443
00:59:16,159 --> 00:59:22,078
microbes and the the level of their

1444
00:59:21,059 --> 00:59:24,119
um

1445
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:26,640
Presence at different times through the

1446
00:59:24,119 --> 00:59:29,400
plant's life I think the mistake would

1447
00:59:26,639 --> 00:59:31,500
be to take one sample and say look at

1448
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:34,619
all the microbes I've found and say

1449
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:37,559
that's it that's all the plant needs now

1450
00:59:34,619 --> 00:59:41,160
and forever I think we have to

1451
00:59:37,559 --> 00:59:43,680
understand that things change

1452
00:59:41,159 --> 00:59:46,440
and that microbial population will

1453
00:59:43,679 --> 00:59:48,000
change over time as well and be okay

1454
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:48,900
with that

1455
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,940
um

1456
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:52,740
but then by using some of the new tools

1457
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:54,119
that we have we can get a better

1458
00:59:52,739 --> 00:59:55,558
understanding if we have that

1459
00:59:54,119 --> 00:59:57,539
understanding and then maybe as we get

1460
00:59:55,559 --> 01:00:00,000
to a point

1461
00:59:57,539 --> 01:00:03,480
to sort of say well at this time the

1462
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:06,719
plant typically needs microbes you know

1463
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:09,240
X Y and Z or something like that

1464
01:00:06,719 --> 01:00:11,279
um let's make sure they're there or what

1465
01:00:09,239 --> 01:00:13,979
can we do to promote these microbes at

1466
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:16,798
this time and then change perhaps a feed

1467
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:19,318
in the soil to encourage other microbes

1468
01:00:16,798 --> 01:00:22,619
to be present at another time I think

1469
01:00:19,318 --> 01:00:24,960
it's incredibly complicated

1470
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:27,358
um but as as humans we we try and

1471
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:30,420
simplify it as best we can and come up

1472
01:00:27,358 --> 01:00:34,078
with a with a very sort of simple answer

1473
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:36,298
to a very complex solution so yeah I

1474
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:37,920
think it is complicated

1475
01:00:36,298 --> 01:00:39,079
again you could probably spend a

1476
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:42,180
lifetime

1477
01:00:39,079 --> 01:00:44,720
investigating that and uh still not have

1478
01:00:42,179 --> 01:00:44,719
the right answer

1479
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:50,519
yeah I find it absolutely fascinating

1480
01:00:48,179 --> 01:00:54,179
yeah beautiful question Todd beautiful

1481
01:00:50,519 --> 01:00:56,519
question thank you I mean I guess I

1482
01:00:54,179 --> 01:01:00,539
asked this in the context of

1483
01:00:56,519 --> 01:01:02,818
the idea that we have knowing that the

1484
01:01:00,539 --> 01:01:05,639
microbial life in soil is constantly

1485
01:01:02,818 --> 01:01:07,940
evolving constantly changing

1486
01:01:05,639 --> 01:01:10,558
um yeah hopefully selecting for

1487
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:13,079
microorganisms that are going to be more

1488
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:15,359
beneficial for the plant as that plant

1489
01:01:13,079 --> 01:01:18,960
is continually putting out exudates to

1490
01:01:15,358 --> 01:01:19,920
support those sets of microorganisms

1491
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:23,400
um

1492
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:28,380
I I guess for me it almost feels too

1493
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:29,700
derivative to try and a reductionist to

1494
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:30,298
try and make

1495
01:01:29,699 --> 01:01:32,699
um

1496
01:01:30,298 --> 01:01:35,639
any assumptions around

1497
01:01:32,699 --> 01:01:38,519
microbial life other than to say hey

1498
01:01:35,639 --> 01:01:40,259
we're dealing with this problem and we

1499
01:01:38,519 --> 01:01:42,838
know that these species

1500
01:01:40,260 --> 01:01:45,299
can there's research the point that you

1501
01:01:42,838 --> 01:01:47,880
know trichoderma battles these problems

1502
01:01:45,298 --> 01:01:49,318
or mycorrhizal fungi with this uptake

1503
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:50,880
yeah and so there's there's targeted

1504
01:01:49,318 --> 01:01:53,818
things I feel comfortable saying we can

1505
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:56,160
do but as a general rule looking at

1506
01:01:53,818 --> 01:01:59,338
you know fungal to bacteria ratios or

1507
01:01:56,159 --> 01:02:02,578
you know entire sets of organisms

1508
01:01:59,338 --> 01:02:04,798
um and that's where it feels like it

1509
01:02:02,579 --> 01:02:06,059
it's like the forest through the trees

1510
01:02:04,798 --> 01:02:08,519
almost

1511
01:02:06,059 --> 01:02:11,460
absolutely agree I mean I think you're

1512
01:02:08,519 --> 01:02:14,639
right there are certain key organisms we

1513
01:02:11,460 --> 01:02:16,740
can we can uh hone in on and I think

1514
01:02:14,639 --> 01:02:18,900
that to you to your reference there the

1515
01:02:16,739 --> 01:02:20,818
strike certain certain trichoderma

1516
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:22,798
species for Disease Control they will

1517
01:02:20,818 --> 01:02:26,880
also help you know help the plant let's

1518
01:02:22,798 --> 01:02:29,639
say uh mycorrhizae uh bacillus species

1519
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:30,358
we we know that they can they're pretty

1520
01:02:29,639 --> 01:02:34,858
um

1521
01:02:30,358 --> 01:02:37,139
tough organisms that will establish and

1522
01:02:34,858 --> 01:02:39,420
grow in a wide range of soil types a

1523
01:02:37,139 --> 01:02:41,279
wide range of pH values and a wide and

1524
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:43,858
the form associations with a wide range

1525
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:45,240
of crop species or plant species better

1526
01:02:43,858 --> 01:02:46,318
put

1527
01:02:45,239 --> 01:02:49,259
um

1528
01:02:46,318 --> 01:02:53,400
so I think those are again ones we can

1529
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:56,280
sort of look to and perhaps count on to

1530
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:59,519
bring in their their a game every single

1531
01:02:56,280 --> 01:03:01,200
time you you use them pretty well rather

1532
01:02:59,519 --> 01:03:02,579
than trying to get

1533
01:03:01,199 --> 01:03:04,558
um

1534
01:03:02,579 --> 01:03:06,599
understand what the heck's going on with

1535
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:08,220
that whole microbial ecology in the soil

1536
01:03:06,599 --> 01:03:10,318
and somehow

1537
01:03:08,219 --> 01:03:11,939
um control it you know I think I think

1538
01:03:10,318 --> 01:03:14,818
one of the things that just popped into

1539
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:17,039
my head as well is you know every single

1540
01:03:14,818 --> 01:03:18,779
organism we've talked about including

1541
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:19,679
plants

1542
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:22,019
um

1543
01:03:19,679 --> 01:03:24,960
The Beneficial ones especially need

1544
01:03:22,019 --> 01:03:27,719
oxygen so you know how else can you

1545
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:29,338
affect the microbial Community well it

1546
01:03:27,719 --> 01:03:32,459
depends on

1547
01:03:29,338 --> 01:03:33,380
how much water you put into a plant as

1548
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:35,880
well

1549
01:03:33,380 --> 01:03:38,338
will affect the plant will affect the

1550
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:39,119
microbial community and so there's a lot

1551
01:03:38,338 --> 01:03:40,858
of

1552
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:42,420
you know it goes back to what I was

1553
01:03:40,858 --> 01:03:45,000
touching on earlier you know what role

1554
01:03:42,420 --> 01:03:47,639
does environment play in all of these

1555
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:51,000
associations as well so that adds an

1556
01:03:47,639 --> 01:03:54,779
extra layer of complexity to to uh to

1557
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:55,619
any valuation or to any study but but I

1558
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:58,920
think

1559
01:03:55,619 --> 01:04:00,539
to sort of bring it down to simplify it

1560
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:03,659
somewhat and back to your point I think

1561
01:04:00,539 --> 01:04:04,500
yes there are certain key microbes we

1562
01:04:03,659 --> 01:04:08,179
know

1563
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:10,500
will perform well will consistently

1564
01:04:08,179 --> 01:04:14,219
establish and form those beneficial

1565
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:17,099
associations with plants and uh

1566
01:04:14,219 --> 01:04:18,179
those are things you know from a from a

1567
01:04:17,099 --> 01:04:20,400
perhaps from a disease management

1568
01:04:18,179 --> 01:04:22,019
perspective ones that we can we can

1569
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:23,700
pretty well hang our hats on and say we

1570
01:04:22,019 --> 01:04:26,059
know this works and here's the data to

1571
01:04:23,699 --> 01:04:26,058
show it

1572
01:04:26,639 --> 01:04:31,199
yeah okay so last question I'm going to

1573
01:04:29,338 --> 01:04:33,000
throw you a curveball here

1574
01:04:31,199 --> 01:04:36,389
um

1575
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:41,460
I've seen this for foreign

1576
01:04:36,389 --> 01:04:42,960
[Laughter]

1577
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:45,599
I'm trying to think how to phrase this

1578
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:48,119
so I see a lot of people on social media

1579
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:50,039
um or you know coming from the compost

1580
01:04:48,119 --> 01:04:51,960
tea industry where

1581
01:04:50,039 --> 01:04:54,900
when you add

1582
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:59,880
a food source let's say alfalfa meal or

1583
01:04:54,900 --> 01:05:02,099
uh oat flour you get uh

1584
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:04,640
you get a growth on the surface a sort

1585
01:05:02,099 --> 01:05:07,920
of a white fuzzy mold growth and people

1586
01:05:04,639 --> 01:05:10,558
show this as as it being beneficial or

1587
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:11,900
probiotic or a sign of good microbial

1588
01:05:10,559 --> 01:05:15,680
activity

1589
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:15,680
what are your thoughts on that

1590
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:21,599
I would say what is the fungus I

1591
01:05:19,559 --> 01:05:23,460
guarantee I can throw anything like that

1592
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:26,039
in my garden and within a matter of days

1593
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:28,619
it'll be white and fluffy too it doesn't

1594
01:05:26,039 --> 01:05:31,079
mean it's a beneficial fungus it just

1595
01:05:28,619 --> 01:05:33,298
means there's a fungus there which can

1596
01:05:31,079 --> 01:05:35,818
utilize that

1597
01:05:33,298 --> 01:05:37,440
whatever it is as a food source and

1598
01:05:35,818 --> 01:05:39,139
proliferates on it

1599
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:41,179
so

1600
01:05:39,139 --> 01:05:43,920
this measure

1601
01:05:41,179 --> 01:05:46,679
there's no evidence that it has any sort

1602
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:49,700
of plant or soil benefit it it could

1603
01:05:46,679 --> 01:05:52,259
very well be innocuous

1604
01:05:49,699 --> 01:05:54,539
could be totally innocuous you know the

1605
01:05:52,260 --> 01:05:56,880
soil is full of all sorts of

1606
01:05:54,539 --> 01:05:58,858
um microbes which just hang out there

1607
01:05:56,880 --> 01:06:01,380
you know they derive

1608
01:05:58,858 --> 01:06:03,298
food from a you know

1609
01:06:01,380 --> 01:06:05,519
a wide variety of sources a lot of them

1610
01:06:03,298 --> 01:06:08,639
are just decomposers you know

1611
01:06:05,519 --> 01:06:11,940
some of them may form associations with

1612
01:06:08,639 --> 01:06:13,078
plants others might form associations

1613
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:13,920
with

1614
01:06:13,079 --> 01:06:15,839
um

1615
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:18,659
arthropods which live in the soil you

1616
01:06:15,838 --> 01:06:20,818
know they just happen to be there and

1617
01:06:18,659 --> 01:06:22,739
um went for it to be ingested by an

1618
01:06:20,818 --> 01:06:24,779
arthropod and then they yeah I don't

1619
01:06:22,739 --> 01:06:27,419
know but yeah just to get something

1620
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:28,260
white and fluffy growing on

1621
01:06:27,420 --> 01:06:31,380
um

1622
01:06:28,260 --> 01:06:34,319
a Alfalfa powder or oatmeal powder

1623
01:06:31,380 --> 01:06:38,539
doesn't prove a darn thing

1624
01:06:34,318 --> 01:06:40,259
awesome thank you hopefully that will

1625
01:06:38,539 --> 01:06:42,000
make people think a little more

1626
01:06:40,260 --> 01:06:47,039
critically about some of these photos I

1627
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:47,940
see yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and you

1628
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:51,000
know

1629
01:06:47,940 --> 01:06:52,679
I'm not I I I know there's a lot of

1630
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:54,539
thought and passion put into a lot of

1631
01:06:52,679 --> 01:06:56,578
these things so I'm not doubting the the

1632
01:06:54,539 --> 01:06:58,980
good intent behind a lot of a lot of

1633
01:06:56,579 --> 01:07:00,660
these claims but I think we need to be a

1634
01:06:58,980 --> 01:07:02,579
little bit more

1635
01:07:00,659 --> 01:07:04,639
um

1636
01:07:02,579 --> 01:07:07,798
discerning

1637
01:07:04,639 --> 01:07:10,618
yeah or scientific and how we actually

1638
01:07:07,798 --> 01:07:13,019
say this is good this is bad or this is

1639
01:07:10,619 --> 01:07:14,818
a sign of something really good or or

1640
01:07:13,019 --> 01:07:16,739
whatever and Discerning is a good word

1641
01:07:14,818 --> 01:07:18,960
that just because it's white and flooded

1642
01:07:16,739 --> 01:07:21,239
fluffy doesn't make it a good thing you

1643
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:23,460
know botrytis can be white and fluffy as

1644
01:07:21,239 --> 01:07:25,739
confusarium be white and fluffy as can

1645
01:07:23,460 --> 01:07:27,539
penicillin be white and fluffy

1646
01:07:25,739 --> 01:07:29,959
um is that a good thing have we got good

1647
01:07:27,539 --> 01:07:32,339
or we got bad again

1648
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:35,699
it doesn't really answer the question

1649
01:07:32,338 --> 01:07:38,338
which is good you've got a fungus here

1650
01:07:35,699 --> 01:07:40,798
that's about all you can say what is it

1651
01:07:38,338 --> 01:07:42,900
I'd love to know what what that fungus

1652
01:07:40,798 --> 01:07:43,858
is so

1653
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:47,400
um

1654
01:07:43,858 --> 01:07:49,798
great Point thank you yeah yeah you're

1655
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:51,720
welcome you're welcome we'll continue

1656
01:07:49,798 --> 01:07:53,940
this conversation next time we meet Todd

1657
01:07:51,719 --> 01:07:56,279
I think it's a fascinating topic

1658
01:07:53,940 --> 01:07:58,380
absolutely thank you so much for your

1659
01:07:56,280 --> 01:08:01,880
time today and I I do look forward to

1660
01:07:58,380 --> 01:08:01,880
catching up with you again soon
