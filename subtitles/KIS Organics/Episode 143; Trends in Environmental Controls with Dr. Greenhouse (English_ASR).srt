indoors in green houses and in

44
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:50,959
facilities that would otherwise be

45
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:52,159
impossible or impractical to do so now

46
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:55,438
on to the

47
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:58,359
show to the show hey Tad thank you for

48
00:01:55,438 --> 00:02:00,679
having me yeah I'm really excited to

49
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:03,000
catch up again with you I I know it's

50
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:05,360
been a a little while since we last

51
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,439
chatted uh what have you been up

52
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:12,159
to well it's the new year um and you

53
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:14,878
know with every new year we think about

54
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:17,239
you know what what the year before

55
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:20,840
brought us or didn't bring us and what

56
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:23,120
we um hope the the next year will bring

57
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:27,479
so I've been thinking a lot about the

58
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:30,439
trends um in our industry uh in 2023 and

59
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:33,280
2024 and and looking ahead and and

60
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:36,598
trying to predict or you know consider

61
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:39,719
will some of those Trends continue into

62
00:02:36,598 --> 00:02:42,799
2025 um I recently posted a Blog about

63
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:45,000
my predictions uh today um my podcast

64
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,599
episode going into a little bit more

65
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,840
detail on my predictions and Trends um

66
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:53,639
it posted today um today is January

67
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:56,759
21st and you know we're just we're

68
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:59,359
looking ahead to you know looking

69
00:02:56,759 --> 00:03:01,359
forward to more Greenhouse projects I

70
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,280
think that's one of the biggest trends

71
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:07,040
that we have seen in the industry across

72
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:09,318
all the crops that we work with you know

73
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:13,318
growing indoors is really energy

74
00:03:09,318 --> 00:03:16,919
intensive and um you know the P

75
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:20,679
Piper is is asking to have their you

76
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:22,679
know their dues paid in in a sense and

77
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,599
it isn't always panning out it's not

78
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:28,200
necessarily a profitable business and so

79
00:03:24,598 --> 00:03:30,639
finding new ways to you know increase

80
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:32,598
the bottom line increase those margins

81
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:34,598
and actually first off just be

82
00:03:32,598 --> 00:03:37,679
profitable or at least Break Even which

83
00:03:34,598 --> 00:03:40,518
a lot of Growers haven't been able to do

84
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,480
um or it's been very marginal and so you

85
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:44,879
know there's only so much you can do to

86
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:46,759
increase your rate of growth and your

87
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:48,598
your yield and your output and so more

88
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:51,239
and more Growers and operators are

89
00:03:48,598 --> 00:03:56,119
looking at how do we cut costs um and

90
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:58,158
you know energy is you know 30 to 50% of

91
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:00,000
uh Growers cost uh depending on where

92
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:03,120
you are and depending on what your labor

93
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,079
situation is um and so you know we're

94
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,400
seeing a lot of that as well as you know

95
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:11,799
a lot of interest in Automation and AI

96
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:15,438
though what I will say is a major Gap in

97
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:17,478
the industry is is data um you know

98
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:20,560
people aren't necessarily collecting

99
00:04:17,478 --> 00:04:22,399
data or they might be monitoring with

100
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,040
you know some of the the monitoring

101
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:26,239
systems that are out there but it's not

102
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:29,720
actually being recorded or downloaded

103
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,840
anywhere so you know you're kind of like

104
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,320
kind of guessing I mean you have a feel

105
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:36,279
for it on a day-to-day basis but you

106
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:39,680
know that doesn't necessarily mean that

107
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:42,918
over you know the course of a of a full

108
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:46,038
you know Harvest cycle or a full year or

109
00:04:42,918 --> 00:04:49,120
or a season um you have more of a gut

110
00:04:46,038 --> 00:04:52,319
feeling than the data to support

111
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,959
decisionmaking so um you know we're

112
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:58,478
we're hoping and encouraging Growers to

113
00:04:54,959 --> 00:05:00,159
implement you know more robust systems

114
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:02,120
even again if it's not tied into

115
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,479
controls and it is still monitoring like

116
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:07,319
just get a monitoring system that

117
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:09,680
actually records that data so that we

118
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:13,360
can then even help you analyze that data

119
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:16,478
if you don't know how to do it um but

120
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,720
yeah it's uh you know 20125 is going to

121
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:20,240
be an interesting year 2023 and 24

122
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,080
already were I mean honestly the last

123
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,720
five or seven years were interesting

124
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:27,680
right I mean we had covid and then we

125
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:31,759
had inflation and supply chain issues

126
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:34,759
and I mean and 280e is drowning the

127
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,960
Cannabis industry and over Supply and

128
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:39,759
it's just like okay how do we sort of

129
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:41,959
course correct here so honestly that's

130
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:45,038
what I'm up to is just thinking about

131
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:47,038
the course the path you know forward and

132
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:50,560
how Dr Greenhouse can fit into the

133
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:53,079
success um of of Growers you know

134
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:56,240
production goals and profitability goals

135
00:05:53,079 --> 00:06:00,159
and you know work life balance and you

136
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:03,879
know all all of those things so um

137
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:07,680
I guess that's what I'm up to thinking a

138
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:10,240
lot that's great and for people who are

139
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,360
unfamiliar the podcast is called the

140
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:16,199
doctor is in and you can find it on all

141
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:20,199
major platforms uh Nadia's website is

142
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:23,280
drg greenhouse.com and she also I I use

143
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:26,360
this uh fairly regularly is your VPD

144
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:28,758
chart and your VPD app so there's an app

145
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,960
you can download from the App Store it's

146
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:33,360
free and you can put in your VPD and

147
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:36,519
it'll tell you where you land when you

148
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,919
enter your your um temperature and your

149
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:43,879
humidity um so a couple resources for

150
00:06:38,918 --> 00:06:47,038
folks now your area of expertise is

151
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:51,159
probably the area where I feel the least

152
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:52,598
competent because it's so complicated um

153
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,199
I have a I have a bunch of questions I

154
00:06:52,598 --> 00:06:59,199
want to cover today but let's just start

155
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:01,360
off with talking about um what are your

156
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:04,038
sort of initial considerations when you

157
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,120
walk into a new grow space like what

158
00:07:04,038 --> 00:07:07,959
goes through your head because I

159
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,560
realized like with the the variety of

160
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:13,878
ways that people are growing from you

161
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:17,160
know an indoor tent a 4x4 tent to a

162
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:19,120
garage to facilities indoors to green

163
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:23,199
houses and you see all different shapes

164
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:25,639
and sizes um and not even that just

165
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,720
different ways that fans are configured

166
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:29,598
and airflow in and out and sealed and

167
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,599
unsealed like this is a very complicated

168
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:33,199
topic what do you what do you think

169
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:36,038
about though when you walk into a new

170
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,598
space from an environmental perspective

171
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:40,680
yeah I I mean thank you for this

172
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:42,759
question I mean one trend of 2024 is

173
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:45,560
that I was visiting a lot of sites all

174
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:49,560
over the country um both green houses

175
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:53,598
and indoor to really help Growers and

176
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:55,800
operators improve the conditions of the

177
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:58,360
facility that they already have rather

178
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,400
than helping investors right figure out

179
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:02,400
where to spend their 20 or $30 million

180
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:05,158
we're like okay how can we spend a few

181
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:08,120
hundred, to improve the asset that we

182
00:08:05,158 --> 00:08:10,680
already have and one of the areas is

183
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:14,439
always climate control and you know the

184
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:17,598
the the two most challenging areas in

185
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:20,680
terms of managing the environment has

186
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:22,519
remained the same for 10 or 20 or 30

187
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:26,879
years I've been doing this for 26 years

188
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:28,478
now um is air flow and humidity control

189
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,280
it doesn't matter the facility it

190
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:34,319
doesn't matter the crop

191
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:36,240
um those are the two primary concerns uh

192
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,719
and I'm so happy that more and more

193
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,799
people are actually shifting away or

194
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,879
maybe they're figuring out the

195
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:44,000
dehumidification question and are asking

196
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:45,519
more and more about the airf flow

197
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,879
question I think I told you earlier I

198
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:50,080
was just at a mushroom conference and

199
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:55,120
talking about airflow mushroom Growers

200
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:57,000
are challenged with good airf flow um so

201
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:00,560
that is the first thing I look for quite

202
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,120
honestly is I am looking at your airflow

203
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:06,199
devices whether that's a duct whether

204
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,360
that's a poly tube whether it's a fanc

205
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:11,759
unit sitting in the corner of your grow

206
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:13,680
tent you know whether it's fans blowing

207
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:16,399
on your plants or not blowing on your

208
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:18,838
plants um that is always the first thing

209
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:21,799
that I'm looking for in fact I was made

210
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:24,320
fun of many years ago I'm I'm a both an

211
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:26,519
agricultural and a mechanical engineer

212
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:30,000
um and you know I've studied HVAC a long

213
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:33,759
time and I walk into any room and I am

214
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,759
looking up at where the diffusers are um

215
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:37,720
where the return registers are where the

216
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:40,200
equipment is um because I know that

217
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:44,040
that's going to affect how I feel down

218
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:45,879
here and the same is true with plants um

219
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:48,078
and so that's the first thing that my

220
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:51,000
eyeballs go to probably are the

221
00:09:48,078 --> 00:09:54,120
circulation fans do you have them where

222
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,440
are they positioned how many do you have

223
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,879
are they you know blowing in the right

224
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:01,040
direction are they fighting against each

225
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:03,720
other because they're pointing in 17

226
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:05,958
different directions that is not even an

227
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:08,759
exaggeration I've walked into some green

228
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:11,159
houses and indoor Farms where fans are

229
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:14,159
pointing in multiple directions not

230
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:16,958
working together and just I mean it's

231
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:18,600
chaos um and and so that's one of the

232
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:21,479
first things I'm looking for is how are

233
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:24,159
we moving air in this space and how are

234
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:26,600
we getting air into this space are we

235
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:29,399
using outside air or is it 100%

236
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:32,200
circulation is it overhead is it under

237
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:34,958
tables all of those things because

238
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:37,278
airflow is you know you can have the

239
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:39,919
right size HVAC equipment it can have

240
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:42,600
the right capacity of cooling and

241
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:44,958
dehumidification you know for an entire

242
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:50,440
grow space whether it's you know 500

243
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:51,159
square feet or five 5,000 square feet um

244
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,720
you

245
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:56,439
know you can have the right capacity but

246
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:59,399
if you cannot get it to where the plants

247
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:02,519
are um who cares right it's just going

248
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:05,200
to circulate on itself um and and it's

249
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:07,560
not going to do a lot of good so how do

250
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,879
we distribute that conditioned air to a

251
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:11,078
space so that's one of the first things

252
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:14,480
I'm looking for the other thing I I

253
00:11:11,078 --> 00:11:17,799
notice right away is the layout of the

254
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:20,480
room the plant density you know how tall

255
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:23,120
the plants are the different ages if you

256
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,320
have multiple stages of plants and you

257
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:28,759
know a lot of times right you you have a

258
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:30,600
one room or you know that is dedicated

259
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:33,679
right for the next eight weeks eight to

260
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:37,800
10 weeks of growing out say a a cannabis

261
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:40,719
flower plant um and uh and so all the

262
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:42,759
ages are the same but their morphology

263
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,399
is different right all the you might

264
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:46,039
have multiple strains in that room and

265
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,519
so you have short plants you have tall

266
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:51,078
plants you have medium plants right you

267
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:54,240
have more squat plants or you know more

268
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:57,519
narrow plants and you know

269
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:59,919
how how are those

270
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:02,519
plants uh configured

271
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:04,000
relative to each other you know I mean

272
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:06,120
there are some rooms I walk into and it

273
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,200
looks like a wave right because it's

274
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:10,879
like you have small plants next to tall

275
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:13,278
strains next to small cultivars next to

276
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:14,879
tall cultivars right and so it's just

277
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:17,039
kind of all over the place and when I

278
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:19,519
think about again airf flow I'm thinking

279
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:21,679
well are those tall plants

280
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:24,000
obstructing airf flow to get to the

281
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:26,359
shorter plants right or are the shorter

282
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,759
plants creating just like a Channel of

283
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:31,360
air in between the tall plants right

284
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:35,078
depending on on how it's going and so

285
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:38,000
you know I I look for uniformity also in

286
00:12:35,078 --> 00:12:42,319
crop morphology um and it doesn't have

287
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:46,720
to be uniform necessarily but it kind of

288
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:48,839
you know if if we can design a room both

289
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:52,040
the plants and the air distribution

290
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:54,079
system that works together as opposed to

291
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:56,399
in opposition of each other or

292
00:12:54,078 --> 00:12:59,239
obstructing each other um then you're

293
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,399
going to have more uniform conditions um

294
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,720
you know you're not going to have these

295
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,759
hot spots or or you know stagnant

296
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:08,440
corners of the room because air will be

297
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:10,159
able to move freely within that room so

298
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:12,079
those are kind of the first two things

299
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:14,919
of course I'm noticing if it's single

300
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:17,198
level double level right like sort of

301
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:20,198
what kind of crop style or or cropping

302
00:13:17,198 --> 00:13:22,439
system we have I don't pay as much

303
00:13:20,198 --> 00:13:24,879
attention to irrigation and the

304
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:27,160
substrate and cropping system it is

305
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:30,159
important um especially if you're

306
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:32,639
growing say in you know living soil you

307
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:36,639
might only be watering once every couple

308
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:39,240
of days um and so the the Dynamics of

309
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:41,399
water vapor and evaporation in that

310
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:45,159
space might be different than if you are

311
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:47,320
growing in rock wool or cocoa core with

312
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:49,439
drip irrigation right and and those

313
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:51,680
those systems are meant to drain and you

314
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,720
might be irrigating multiple times a day

315
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:57,479
and so we would expect a different

316
00:13:53,720 --> 00:14:00,000
evaporation profile in those rooms um

317
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:03,079
and so that is interesting uh and then

318
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,559
the other thing that I look for is is

319
00:14:03,078 --> 00:14:07,679
there water

320
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:09,479
everywhere and not necessarily because

321
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:12,439
of irrigation but because of

322
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:14,800
condensation and condensate collection a

323
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:18,120
lot of Growers have dehumidifiers in the

324
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:20,198
room or fan coil units in the room and

325
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:23,120
they are condensing right that water

326
00:14:20,198 --> 00:14:26,359
vapor um out of the air through the

327
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:30,360
dehumidification process and too many

328
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:32,639
times we see overflow of the drain pan

329
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,959
you know just spill water spilling over

330
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:39,360
onto the floor or into the corner of the

331
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:41,399
room um or we see you know that um you

332
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,839
know the the drain pipe off the

333
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:47,480
condensate isn't designed correctly uh

334
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:50,480
and so it's it's it's backing up and

335
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:52,759
clogging up the the drain pan or you

336
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:55,680
know the ability to drain to the to the

337
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:57,680
floor or whatever um and and why that's

338
00:14:55,679 --> 00:15:00,198
important to me I mean it's it's a lot

339
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:02,638
of things on an AG back perspective it

340
00:15:00,198 --> 00:15:04,719
means that I'm not

341
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:08,399
controlling the water balance in the

342
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:11,120
room as well as I want to be because

343
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:13,679
rather than removing that water vapor

344
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,278
from the room I'm now just reintroducing

345
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:17,479
it to a spot on the

346
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:19,958
floor right so now I have to re-

347
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:22,000
evaporate it that that takes extra work

348
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:23,799
to do that right like to re- evaporate

349
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,720
the same water over and over because

350
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:29,439
it's not leaving the building uh so to

351
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:32,399
speak um so that's one concern the

352
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:37,160
second concern is you know that is a

353
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:40,278
place where algae can grow bacteria can

354
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:43,318
grow mold can grow and so now it becomes

355
00:15:40,278 --> 00:15:45,600
a contamination risk for our Growers

356
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:48,919
right and for those plants that's not a

357
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:52,120
good thing and the third thing is a risk

358
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:53,599
to to people who are working in that

359
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,560
space right because now that becomes a

360
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,920
slipping Hazard not just on the water

361
00:15:55,559 --> 00:16:00,000
but now that slippery algae right I mean

362
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:02,958
I think a lot of of people have had that

363
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,240
experience um where you slip on that

364
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:07,599
that that green water and you know woo

365
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:11,318
kind of got to catch yourself as you

366
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:14,959
skate across um and so you know I I

367
00:16:11,318 --> 00:16:16,679
noticed water uh on the floor and on

368
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:18,359
surfaces um because that's what we're

369
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:21,039
trying to control through

370
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:23,159
dehumidification um and so when I walk

371
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:25,439
through a site a lot of times that's the

372
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:29,120
thing that I point at that the

373
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:31,279
maintenance guys come right away and fix

374
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:34,198
um and so honestly I really have fun

375
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:36,278
doing site visits and and and visiting

376
00:16:34,198 --> 00:16:39,359
facilities because there's always

377
00:16:36,278 --> 00:16:41,519
something to point out that can be fixed

378
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,199
right there on the spot you know Growers

379
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:46,839
kind of become blind um you know they're

380
00:16:44,198 --> 00:16:48,519
so fixed on the plants and on nutrient

381
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:50,160
recipes right like these are really

382
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:52,639
great things to be focused on that's

383
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:56,799
what they should be focused on um but

384
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:58,919
they you know become blind to the

385
00:16:56,799 --> 00:17:01,039
everyday things that are happening or

386
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:04,759
may not realize what the risk or what

387
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:06,399
the consequences are um and on and on

388
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:09,038
that note the last thing I'll just say

389
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:12,160
is is I look

390
00:17:09,038 --> 00:17:14,519
for where air is entering or leaving

391
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,480
where it shouldn't be um you know

392
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:20,359
whether it's a greenhouse or an indoor

393
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:23,240
facility you know sometimes we see that

394
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:26,279
the building the structure isn't sealed

395
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:29,120
well you know the the seal around

396
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:31,240
diffusers um or penetrations through a w

397
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:33,759
isn't sealed well and that's where heat

398
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:36,079
and humidity can come into your space

399
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:37,960
that's where heat and humidity can leave

400
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:40,798
your space in an

401
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:43,679
uncontrolled manner um and again that's

402
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:45,359
not great for you know for HVAC control

403
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,798
and what we're trying to achieve with

404
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:50,639
our heating cooling and dehumidification

405
00:17:47,798 --> 00:17:54,440
systems um but it's also an energy drain

406
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:56,200
on your facility because you know you're

407
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,919
if you're in Minnesota and you're

408
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:01,120
leaking out hot humid air right that

409
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:03,400
just more heat that you're going to have

410
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:06,639
to add into that Greenhouse um because

411
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:09,038
there's a hole in your wall um or if

412
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:11,559
you're in Arizona right hot dry air is

413
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:13,879
going to come in to one corner or one

414
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:18,038
you know spot in your room and you're

415
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:20,799
going to lose control of that room so um

416
00:18:18,038 --> 00:18:23,000
you know looking at the Integrity of the

417
00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:26,400
space looking at the space itself and

418
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:30,240
looking at all the air devices um it's a

419
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:32,600
lot I look I notice a lot of things

420
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,120
that's good that's good and I know you

421
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:37,038
you kind of already answered my next

422
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:38,759
question but uh was there anything you

423
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:42,279
can elaborate on in regards to the most

424
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:44,759
common mistakes you see in regards to

425
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:46,960
environmental control or air flow you

426
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:48,919
mentioned fans pointing in the same dire

427
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:52,679
or opposite directions kind of battling

428
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:54,759
each other um what are yeah what are

429
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:56,159
some other things that you see as just

430
00:18:54,759 --> 00:19:00,558
common grower

431
00:18:56,159 --> 00:19:03,480
mistakes on on on this topic

432
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:07,158
yeah I mean I think one of the most

433
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:09,839
common mistakes is not thinking about

434
00:19:07,159 --> 00:19:12,400
how the various pieces of equipment and

435
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:16,480
systems are going to interact with each

436
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:18,280
other right so you might have an air

437
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:21,679
conditioning unit sitting on the wall

438
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:23,319
over here you can see my hand over here

439
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,320
um and then you might have an

440
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:27,759
oscillating fan on the wall over here

441
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:29,558
and that oscillating fan is blowing

442
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:31,558
towards

443
00:19:29,558 --> 00:19:33,558
that uh that fan coil unit that air

444
00:19:31,558 --> 00:19:35,519
conditioning unit sitting on the wall

445
00:19:33,558 --> 00:19:38,000
well that air conditioning unit is

446
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:40,839
trying to blow air away from itself

447
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,839
right and and to the center of the room

448
00:19:40,839 --> 00:19:44,798
while that oscillating fan is trying to

449
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:47,359
blow air towards the center of the room

450
00:19:44,798 --> 00:19:50,119
in the opposite direction and now you

451
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:52,798
know you don't get good airflow or good

452
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:54,439
conditioning anywhere in the space right

453
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:57,599
like you might have good air flow near

454
00:19:54,440 --> 00:20:00,558
the fan but it's you know crappy

455
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:02,839
conditions and then away from the flan

456
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:05,200
where that fan coil unit is you might

457
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:07,279
have really cool dry air over on this

458
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:10,120
side of the room but it never makes it

459
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:12,319
to the opposite wall um and so you know

460
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:15,359
that's just kind of one example or where

461
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:17,759
your heaters are located in a greenhouse

462
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:20,319
you know if you have an HF fan pointing

463
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:22,279
at the heater you know the heat is just

464
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:25,200
going to blow right back on on top of

465
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:26,798
the heater rather than being carried

466
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,200
away from the heater and into the

467
00:20:26,798 --> 00:20:31,440
greenhouse and over the plants

468
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:34,000
that's probably the biggest thing that I

469
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:38,200
see is look you know can you move this

470
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:42,400
fan over here um or can you know we

471
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:45,558
can't can we ta change the direction of

472
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,919
of those fans um you know rather than

473
00:20:45,558 --> 00:20:48,720
blowing in that direction can they blow

474
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:51,840
in the opposite direction and turn it

475
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:54,360
around um that's one of the biggest

476
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:58,158
mistakes that I see is just not

477
00:20:54,359 --> 00:21:00,199
really paying attention or knowing how

478
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:03,240
to sort of

479
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:06,840
facilitate um conditioning the space

480
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:08,240
with the fans that you have for example

481
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:10,119
the other thing I mean you know I'm just

482
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:13,079
going to stick with fans for a

483
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:16,399
second one of the big sort of biggest

484
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:18,960
head slappers that I have oh man I'm

485
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:23,080
like allergic to something sorry my nose

486
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:24,880
is itching like crazy okay one of the

487
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:28,599
the biggest head slappers that I have

488
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:32,960
when I walk into rooms is when I see a

489
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:37,639
HF horizontal airf flow fans

490
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:40,600
um and vertical airflow fans or vaf fans

491
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:44,000
in the same space operating at the same

492
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:47,119
time so here you have these HF fans that

493
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:50,278
are trying to blow over the top of the

494
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:52,879
canopy um and then you have these VF

495
00:21:50,278 --> 00:21:55,640
fans that are trying to you know suck

496
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:59,360
air from the bottom of the canopy and

497
00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:00,799
kind of distribute it over the top

498
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:02,479
can I can I pause you first something

499
00:22:00,798 --> 00:22:03,960
with just some real quick definitions

500
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,000
for folks who may not be familiar with

501
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:09,000
this terminology so you're talking about

502
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,319
horizontal air fans or airf flow which

503
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,640
is where a fan that's your typical

504
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:16,200
oscillating fan that goes back and forth

505
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:18,360
or sitting there pushing air I guess

506
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:20,679
horizontally so it's really easily

507
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:24,918
defined and then a vertical air flow

508
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:26,480
those suck air up um is that is that the

509
00:22:24,919 --> 00:22:29,080
best way to describe them I'm picturing

510
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:31,679
kind of like a a a nuclear bomb

511
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:33,798
explosion that shape mushroom cloud

512
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:37,759
shape actually that's a really good

513
00:22:33,798 --> 00:22:40,079
analogy yeah okay okay yeah

514
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:41,679
um yeah all right so keep going sorry I

515
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:43,599
just for people who aren't familiar with

516
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:45,360
this it's confusing I know I didn't

517
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:48,558
understand it and I still don't fully

518
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:50,359
understand it so yeah and you know I'm

519
00:22:48,558 --> 00:22:52,480
glad you brought up oscillating fans as

520
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:58,119
part of sort of the HF horizontal

521
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:59,038
airflow fan Community um uh you know HF

522
00:22:58,119 --> 00:23:02,119
fan

523
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:05,519
yeah are really designed to to move air

524
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:08,038
horizontally and usually over the top of

525
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:10,079
the crop um you know so you see them

526
00:23:08,038 --> 00:23:13,519
sort of suspended from the trusses or

527
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:16,879
you see them hanging on the walls um and

528
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:19,440
and so yeah it's a horizontal uh motion

529
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:22,278
of air vertical air flow fans really

530
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:27,440
come in two Styles but the most common

531
00:23:22,278 --> 00:23:30,119
one that I see um are the ones that like

532
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:33,759
you describe kind of like mushroom cloud

533
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:35,199
they suck air from underneath them and

534
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:38,400
then as they go through the fan then

535
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:41,000
they blow air out the top of them and

536
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,759
over the top then sideways so in some

537
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,599
ways they act they have a an a

538
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:47,879
horizontal air flow a trajectory as they

539
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:50,639
leave and then that air then filters

540
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:52,720
down in and under the plant canopy and

541
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,759
then gets sucked back up so it kind of

542
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:59,558
creates like the circular motion around

543
00:23:55,759 --> 00:24:02,278
the canopy and so if you have have both

544
00:23:59,558 --> 00:24:05,240
fans that are blowing horizontally and

545
00:24:02,278 --> 00:24:07,038
fans that are blowing vertically what is

546
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:09,200
the direction of air flow you're going

547
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:12,759
to get in the

548
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:15,960
end it sounds chaotic to me and and this

549
00:24:12,759 --> 00:24:20,359
leads to another question so the main

550
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:22,200
reason that we don't want air crashing

551
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:23,639
into each other is is the main reason

552
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:26,480
just because you end up with

553
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:29,559
microclimates you just don't get good

554
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:33,159
homogeneity um absolutely that's a big

555
00:24:29,558 --> 00:24:34,960
big reason um yeah you you just get air

556
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:38,559
kind of banging into each other so you

557
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:41,399
get these erratic areas of of high

558
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:43,839
velocity and low velocity and no

559
00:24:41,398 --> 00:24:47,798
velocity um and so it's like creating

560
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:49,000
hot spots but of of air motion you know

561
00:24:47,798 --> 00:24:52,038
and then you might have air that's

562
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:56,038
moving upwards downwards sideways

563
00:24:52,038 --> 00:24:57,599
diagonally um and so predicting where

564
00:24:56,038 --> 00:24:59,558
those spots are going to be is really

565
00:24:57,599 --> 00:25:01,959
hard but also that's not the point right

566
00:24:59,558 --> 00:25:05,079
the point is to create homogeneity is to

567
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:06,679
create uniformity um in hopes that you

568
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:09,199
know your crop is all going to grow at

569
00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:11,038
the same rate and with the same quality

570
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,278
if now if you have you know a high

571
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:15,319
velocity area over here and a low

572
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:17,919
velocity over here those plants are

573
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:19,960
going to grow very differently um even

574
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:22,000
if the temperature and humidity was the

575
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:25,480
same um it's kind of like a windchill

576
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:28,679
factor right like you can be outside and

577
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:31,079
it's warm outside um but you you know if

578
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:32,679
the air is still right you're so much

579
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:35,278
more uncomfortable than if there's a

580
00:25:32,679 --> 00:25:38,559
breeze right or if it's windy and so it

581
00:25:35,278 --> 00:25:41,359
it helps to basically pull heat away

582
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:44,918
from our bodies when it's windy the same

583
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:48,278
idea is true um with circulation fans

584
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:50,799
and uh and plants is that if you have a

585
00:25:48,278 --> 00:25:54,839
high velocity then it's going to pull

586
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:56,599
more water vapor away from your plant um

587
00:25:54,839 --> 00:25:59,199
which is going to stress your plant

588
00:25:56,599 --> 00:26:02,798
potentially um and and require it to use

589
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:05,759
more water um to you know to deliver

590
00:26:02,798 --> 00:26:07,879
nutrients and to keep it you know Lush

591
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:11,759
basically um and then if you have an

592
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:13,760
area of stagnant um air flow then your

593
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:15,558
plant might not have Appo transpire

594
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:17,879
enough and then it doesn't move

595
00:26:15,558 --> 00:26:19,879
nutrients at all to the tips of the

596
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:21,159
plant and so you might see Leaf Tipp bur

597
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:23,799
and I know we've talked about that in

598
00:26:21,159 --> 00:26:25,240
the past Tad is is leaf tip bur and so

599
00:26:23,798 --> 00:26:27,079
you can see that under both conditions

600
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:29,038
really high velocity or really low

601
00:26:27,079 --> 00:26:30,278
velocity um

602
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:33,640
and so the goal is to get sort of a

603
00:26:30,278 --> 00:26:36,359
medium velocity everywhere um in the

604
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:38,320
space so that's one of the biggest

605
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:40,439
mistakes is when I see a combination of

606
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:42,558
fans you know I've seen oscillating fans

607
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:44,159
and vertical fans oscillating fans and

608
00:26:42,558 --> 00:26:47,119
then those horizontal fans that are kind

609
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:48,880
of you know position in a racetrack um

610
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:52,079
configuration and then I've seen all of

611
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:54,799
that with also under bench fans or you

612
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:56,398
know underbench air tubes and my

613
00:26:54,798 --> 00:26:58,960
question is always what are you trying

614
00:26:56,398 --> 00:27:02,079
to accomplish with with all of these

615
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:03,759
fans right and and the goal and and what

616
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:05,918
so many Growers say is we want to see

617
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:07,960
the plants

618
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:12,520
dance I don't

619
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:14,919
know where that term was coined but I

620
00:27:12,519 --> 00:27:17,319
don't necessarily want to see plants

621
00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:19,840
dance I want to see maybe a little bit

622
00:27:17,319 --> 00:27:22,200
of movement but if plants are dancing

623
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:24,000
then chances are your air velocity is

624
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:27,480
too high and you're going to stress the

625
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,200
plant okay oh my God T you know uh

626
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,599
what's interesting about this is as

627
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,278
you're saying this I want to go in my

628
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:35,038
girl room right this minute and change

629
00:27:32,278 --> 00:27:38,599
some things that I've done

630
00:27:35,038 --> 00:27:41,720
so I am doing glad that under I am doing

631
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:44,558
under canopy airflow at the moment

632
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:48,558
through a greenhouse convection tube uh

633
00:27:44,558 --> 00:27:50,278
and I have because my room is so my

634
00:27:48,558 --> 00:27:51,798
exterior air is so cold and I can't

635
00:27:50,278 --> 00:27:54,440
condition it well I don't have a lung

636
00:27:51,798 --> 00:27:56,398
room necessarily I'm trying to limit the

637
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:58,558
amount of air exchange that I have into

638
00:27:56,398 --> 00:28:01,278
that room so I'm supplementing CO2 and I

639
00:27:58,558 --> 00:28:03,480
do want to talk CO2 uh as well because I

640
00:28:01,278 --> 00:28:04,880
think that's an interesting thing um

641
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:08,480
that people don't

642
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:11,000
necessarily talk about enough so I I am

643
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:14,240
supplementing CO2 into the air tube

644
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:16,398
which then pushes it up um when it does

645
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:19,720
supplement uh and I'm about a thousand

646
00:28:16,398 --> 00:28:24,278
PPM CO2 just to throw out a number um

647
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:27,120
and uh my I really like the underair

648
00:28:24,278 --> 00:28:29,359
canopy um or under canopy air flow

649
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:32,759
because I'm getting getting a larger

650
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:34,678
volume of air moved for in um at

651
00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:39,398
probably I guess a lower velocity and

652
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:41,200
it's pushing the air up into the stamata

653
00:28:39,398 --> 00:28:44,439
so I'm getting CO2 delivered where I

654
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:46,278
want it uh which is great but then I

655
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:48,038
also have an oscillating fan that was

656
00:28:46,278 --> 00:28:50,278
above the canopy but now that the plants

657
00:28:48,038 --> 00:28:52,278
have grown I'm thinking about it it was

658
00:28:50,278 --> 00:28:55,200
hitting the canopy and I was seeing less

659
00:28:52,278 --> 00:28:57,278
growth on the side where the fan was so

660
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,000
I turned the fan off and now I'm

661
00:28:57,278 --> 00:29:01,319
thinking I need to take it down and put

662
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:04,359
a fan to get air circulation around the

663
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:06,000
room cuz I probably have stagnant air

664
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:08,759
everywhere else that the under canopy

665
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,519
air flow is not hitting um I know it's

666
00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:15,119
hard to describe these things uh without

667
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:17,519
a visual but I think these are the sort

668
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:19,479
of sort of things that you should be

669
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:22,919
thinking about as you're thinking about

670
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:24,360
your your grow space and I'm just trying

671
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:27,640
to think it out out loud as we're going

672
00:29:24,359 --> 00:29:29,359
through it yeah yeah yeah I mean I I

673
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:32,240
love it when Growers come up to me and

674
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:35,240
say Hey you know like I heard what your

675
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:38,240
recommendations were on air velocity and

676
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:41,240
I adjusted my fans you know to to hit

677
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:44,200
that range and it's so much better and

678
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:46,319
what I usually expect is that they're

679
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:48,798
saying that it's too low that you know

680
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:51,398
they had too low of a velocity but I

681
00:29:48,798 --> 00:29:53,960
think I've had more people tell me that

682
00:29:51,398 --> 00:29:56,879
they figured out that they had too high

683
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:59,159
of a velocity um and that once they turn

684
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:02,679
down the velocity of their fans or

685
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:04,000
removed some fans or reconfigured them

686
00:30:02,679 --> 00:30:06,519
you know so they weren't beating up

687
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,359
their plants that their yield just shot

688
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:12,159
through the roof right like their plants

689
00:30:08,359 --> 00:30:14,678
just thrived so much better by not you

690
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:16,919
know just knocking them over with wind

691
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:18,919
and you know when it comes to cannabis

692
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:22,679
the ultimate goal at least in the flower

693
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:25,720
room is to produce flowers when when we

694
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:29,159
have a high air speed what that does is

695
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:33,200
that triggers the plant to bulk

696
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:38,000
up and so it's going to put more of its

697
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:41,159
resources into increasing its stem

698
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:45,880
diameter and beefing up its you know

699
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:48,120
it's its stems and pedales and leaves to

700
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:50,399
withstand you know this high wind

701
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:52,518
velocity rather than putting those

702
00:30:50,398 --> 00:30:55,398
resources into the flower so we're

703
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:58,638
stealing from the plant um or from the

704
00:30:55,398 --> 00:31:01,678
flower production when we have these

705
00:30:58,638 --> 00:31:04,519
really high air velocities so you know

706
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:09,480
for all of you listening the the target

707
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:14,079
is 35 to 1 meter per second which is

708
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:15,679
about 200 to 350 feet per minute um as

709
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:18,278
soon as you start going over that I mean

710
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:20,960
it's not the end of the world but what

711
00:31:18,278 --> 00:31:23,759
we don't want to see is double that um

712
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:27,360
because your plants are just going

713
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:30,200
to you know be more vegetative than

714
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:32,959
being uh reproductive

715
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:35,240
generative now you shared a really

716
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:38,000
interesting Gem of knowledge on my

717
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:41,519
Instagram a couple years back in regards

718
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,240
to a photo I'd put up about a uh I was

719
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:44,919
doing these trivia questions where

720
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:47,720
people try and guess what's going on and

721
00:31:44,919 --> 00:31:51,320
and in this photo a fan had fallen over

722
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:53,880
and was just blasting this one area of

723
00:31:51,319 --> 00:31:56,879
the room and so these leaves were

724
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:59,840
damaged uh can you can you talk about

725
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:02,039
what was actually going on within the

726
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:04,038
plant and and evap transpiration because

727
00:32:02,038 --> 00:32:08,759
I thought that was so fascinating yeah

728
00:32:04,038 --> 00:32:11,759
sure um okay so when plants take up

729
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:15,079
nutrients usually with with every

730
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:17,720
nutrient except one it move they move by

731
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:20,678
osmosis so they go from an area of high

732
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:22,919
concentration at the root Zone um to low

733
00:32:20,679 --> 00:32:25,960
concentration which is you know within

734
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:28,519
the plant itself and so that's how most

735
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:30,639
of you know these

736
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:34,480
chemicals that's really what they are or

737
00:32:30,638 --> 00:32:38,319
molecules move through the plant the one

738
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:40,759
exception is calcium calcium does not

739
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:45,678
move through osmosis it actually gets

740
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:48,798
carried by water so um if if the water

741
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:52,320
moves too quickly through the plant

742
00:32:48,798 --> 00:32:55,839
because you have a high demand for vapo

743
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:58,759
transpiration um then that calcium will

744
00:32:55,839 --> 00:33:01,038
get left behind um and we get deposited

745
00:32:58,759 --> 00:33:04,158
to the ends of the plants to the the

746
00:33:01,038 --> 00:33:07,398
tips of the leaves if if Appo

747
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:10,120
transpiration is too slow then the water

748
00:33:07,398 --> 00:33:12,158
isn't moving fast enough to carry the

749
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:15,599
calcium to where it needs to be before

750
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:18,440
it becomes deficient so that so you can

751
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:21,918
see a phenomenon called Leaf tip burn

752
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:25,278
where the edges of your plants of of the

753
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:27,840
leaves on your plant get crispy right

754
00:33:25,278 --> 00:33:29,919
every grower has seen a crispy Leaf even

755
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:32,519
if you buy Lettuce H you know in a

756
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:34,960
clamshell for instance at the grocery

757
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:36,880
store you might see brown tips on the

758
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:39,440
leaves that's a Calcium deficiency it's

759
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:41,200
not rotted there's nothing you know

760
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,240
necessarily wrong with that plant it

761
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:47,960
just doesn't have calcium at the tips

762
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:49,880
and so it becomes crispy um and you know

763
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:51,679
that that was your trivia question was

764
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:54,039
you know what's happening to this plant

765
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:56,399
why am I seeing these you know Brown

766
00:33:54,038 --> 00:33:58,519
edges you know to the tips of the leaves

767
00:33:56,398 --> 00:34:00,439
and you know it kind of looks similar to

768
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:02,839
a nitrogen deficiency where you get

769
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:05,399
yellowing tips right and and other

770
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:08,000
nutrient deficiencies but it's that

771
00:34:05,398 --> 00:34:10,039
brown crispiness that we're looking for

772
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,079
if you can touch the tips of that plant

773
00:34:10,039 --> 00:34:15,440
and it kind of

774
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:17,000
crunches then that is leaf tip burn um

775
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,480
and that's a Calcium

776
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,039
deficiency and so let me just back up

777
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:23,440
for a second because I know I've used

778
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:26,918
the term evapo transpiration and maybe

779
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:31,079
not everybody knows what that is so a

780
00:34:26,918 --> 00:34:33,559
plant moves water and nutrients through

781
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:38,320
the process of transporation up from the

782
00:34:33,559 --> 00:34:43,679
roots and to the rest of the plant um

783
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:46,838
and so transpiration is literally um uh

784
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:50,240
that that motion that movement of water

785
00:34:46,838 --> 00:34:53,799
and nutrients up and through the plant

786
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:57,399
and what drives transpiration is this

787
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:58,160
term VPD or vapor pressure deficit which

788
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,440
we

789
00:34:58,159 --> 00:35:03,118
uh Tad mentioned we have an app so that

790
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:05,559
you can uh figure out what the right VPD

791
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:07,320
is or what your VPD conditions are based

792
00:35:05,559 --> 00:35:11,119
off of the temperature and humidity in

793
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:14,320
your room um and I like to call VPD the

794
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:19,280
pressure on a plant to transpire so the

795
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:21,519
drier it is in the space the more water

796
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:25,480
is going to want to move from the roots

797
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:27,759
and out into the air um and so when you

798
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:31,679
have a high VPD

799
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:34,079
that's a dry room or dry air and your

800
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:36,759
plants will transpire a lot more moving

801
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:39,680
water very quickly at a very Rapid Way

802
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:41,839
rate through the plant if you have a low

803
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:44,480
vapor pressure deficit that's usually a

804
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:47,880
high relative humidity then the pressure

805
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:50,199
on the plant to transpire is much lower

806
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:54,599
and so water and nutrients move much

807
00:35:50,199 --> 00:35:57,719
more slowly through the plant now if if

808
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:59,720
you for instance are only watering once

809
00:35:57,719 --> 00:36:01,719
every two or 3 days and you have a

810
00:35:59,719 --> 00:36:03,919
really high VPD which means a low

811
00:36:01,719 --> 00:36:07,078
relative humidity it's it's high and dry

812
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:09,480
I call it high VPD and dry uh room

813
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:13,079
condition then your plant is going to

814
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:15,920
use a lot more water to to push out into

815
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:18,400
the room and what you might notice is if

816
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:20,599
you have a really dry room that your

817
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:23,000
plant over time might actually start to

818
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:26,000
wilt because now there's not enough

819
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:29,039
water at the root Zone in order to

820
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,440
support the pressure on the plant to

821
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:34,639
transpire that water pull it up from the

822
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:36,599
soil into the roots through the plant

823
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:38,519
and out into the air and so you might

824
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:42,000
find that you need to water more

825
00:36:38,519 --> 00:36:44,318
frequently if you have a high VPD if the

826
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,400
relative humidity is really low and

827
00:36:44,318 --> 00:36:48,920
that's why you know what's one of the

828
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:51,760
things I love about transpiration is

829
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:55,680
that for non-woody plants like like

830
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:58,359
cannabis for example turer pressure is

831
00:36:55,679 --> 00:37:01,879
what actually holds the plant up and

832
00:36:58,358 --> 00:37:04,759
turg pressure is created by the movement

833
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:07,519
of water and by the water pressing

834
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:09,720
outwards on the cell walls and that's

835
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:11,480
what holds your plant up so if your

836
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:13,439
plant starts to wilt then that means you

837
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:17,599
don't have enough transpiration to

838
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:19,240
literally hold the plant up um and so

839
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:23,640
you know one of the ways that you can

840
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:25,879
actually conserve water is by lowering

841
00:37:23,639 --> 00:37:28,358
your vapor pressure deficit by

842
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:31,119
increasing your relative humidity

843
00:37:28,358 --> 00:37:32,920
your plant won't demand as much water

844
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:34,720
and guess what it also won't demand as

845
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:36,480
many nutrients so you're going to

846
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:39,399
conserve water and you're going to

847
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:42,880
reduce your nutrient load um or your

848
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:46,519
nutrient demand for the plant regardless

849
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:49,358
of what type of Growing System uh you're

850
00:37:46,519 --> 00:37:52,318
using uh and and you can train a plant

851
00:37:49,358 --> 00:37:55,559
very young even you know at this sort of

852
00:37:52,318 --> 00:37:58,318
small veg mini veg stage to be sort of

853
00:37:55,559 --> 00:38:01,039
drought resistant if if you start the

854
00:37:58,318 --> 00:38:03,960
plant with a high relative humidity it

855
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:05,559
will teach itself to conserve water and

856
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:08,599
then you can carry that through for the

857
00:38:05,559 --> 00:38:12,719
next two to three months um with that

858
00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:15,559
plant uh until you harvest it um and and

859
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:18,039
not require you know such a low relative

860
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:19,679
humidity I will say happily that one of

861
00:38:18,039 --> 00:38:22,960
the trends I have seen in the Cannabis

862
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:25,960
industry is a movement away from 75

863
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:27,920
degrees and 50% relative humidity as

864
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:29,519
people are switching to LED are

865
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,838
realizing there's not as much radiant

866
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:33,358
heat so they have to raise the

867
00:38:30,838 --> 00:38:35,519
temperature of the room and Growers are

868
00:38:33,358 --> 00:38:38,440
learning that maybe we don't need such a

869
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:40,719
dry condition um maybe we can raise that

870
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:44,440
relative humidity and they're seeing you

871
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:47,078
know increases right 50% 100% increases

872
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:50,200
in yield because they're allowing

873
00:38:47,079 --> 00:38:53,680
themselves to run a humidity closer to

874
00:38:50,199 --> 00:38:56,879
65 or 70% not a lot of Growers are doing

875
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:59,318
that but the ones that are um are

876
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:02,519
reaping the benefits I would

877
00:38:59,318 --> 00:39:03,960
say yeah yeah I am seeing more people

878
00:39:02,519 --> 00:39:06,679
running higher humidities and I think

879
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:11,000
it's great um yeah couple of thoughts

880
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:14,919
one is that uh what you were describing

881
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:17,039
in the uh Leaf scenario is that some

882
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:18,519
minerals will move through the xylm

883
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:20,759
which is where water moves and some

884
00:39:18,519 --> 00:39:23,800
minerals uh move uh predominantly

885
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:25,599
through the flum and uh minerals that

886
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,760
move through the xylem would have the

887
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:28,318
effect that you're describing so

888
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:31,040
potassium would be another one too with

889
00:39:28,318 --> 00:39:34,559
that leaf tip uh scenario that you

890
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:36,000
described um for people who are uh

891
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:37,838
familiar with the botany side of things

892
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,400
I just think that's really

893
00:39:37,838 --> 00:39:42,960
interesting uh I I just did a post on

894
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:46,599
root hairs talking about how root hair

895
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:48,519
death is really the reason that we see a

896
00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:49,760
limitation whether overwatering or

897
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:51,400
underwatering what we're doing is we're

898
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:54,960
killing rud hairs and that limits the

899
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:57,599
plant's ability to uptake water uptake

900
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:59,800
nutrients and so that can have yeah

901
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:01,838
Downstream effect similar to what you're

902
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:03,560
describing so there's a lot of things

903
00:40:01,838 --> 00:40:07,318
that can create the

904
00:40:03,559 --> 00:40:09,838
same uh visual symptoms from totally

905
00:40:07,318 --> 00:40:11,400
different environmental conditions and I

906
00:40:09,838 --> 00:40:13,960
think that's fascinating and the better

907
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:16,000
we understand the why behind that the

908
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:19,318
better we can be as Growers so I love

909
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,880
that you were able to share that um the

910
00:40:19,318 --> 00:40:23,279
the next question I have for you is

911
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,880
because you brought up turg pressure I

912
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:27,960
got absolutely

913
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:30,160
roasted uh a year or two ago because I

914
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:32,400
made a comment I was watching my plants

915
00:40:30,159 --> 00:40:34,440
and they were doing what people call

916
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:39,960
praying which is essentially let's call

917
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:42,079
it a 45 degree Leaf angle okay and I I

918
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:44,358
made the comment I was like this Leaf

919
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:46,720
angle to me looks to be like suboptimal

920
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:48,400
from a solar panel perspective we're

921
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:50,759
trying to get the most light from a

922
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:53,039
let's say a static light like indoors

923
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:55,000
and our leaves are at this angle it

924
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:57,000
seems to me like if they were flatter

925
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,599
they would get more light so why why is

926
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,920
the plant doing this and people were

927
00:40:58,599 --> 00:41:03,519
just like you're an idiot's turer

928
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:06,358
pressure and I okay yes I realized that

929
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:08,039
turer pressure is determining the leaf

930
00:41:06,358 --> 00:41:11,400
angle but why is the plant doing it

931
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:13,719
because I've seen very unhealthy plants

932
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:16,200
do this that were nutrient deficient

933
00:41:13,719 --> 00:41:19,000
that had less than optimal fertility or

934
00:41:16,199 --> 00:41:22,199
other conditions

935
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:25,119
um one of the hypothesis was that it was

936
00:41:22,199 --> 00:41:28,960
because the plant was trying to access

937
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:31,640
more CO2 because it was a a CO2 or maybe

938
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:33,159
it was a CO2 I think it was a CO2

939
00:41:31,639 --> 00:41:34,920
deficient

940
00:41:33,159 --> 00:41:37,759
environment

941
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:39,119
um but yeah you you're looking at me

942
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:41,280
like you may have some thoughts on this

943
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:43,599
so I I'm gonna shut up now and hear what

944
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:47,519
you have to say well those are all

945
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:51,079
interesting theories um the CO2 one is

946
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:56,920
actually very interesting but really

947
00:41:51,079 --> 00:41:58,800
it's to protect itself um from um you

948
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:00,720
mention mentioned you know maybe a

949
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,560
highlight condition and that's exactly

950
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:06,759
what it's doing is that if it is growing

951
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:09,639
in a stressful environment um where it's

952
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:11,599
maybe really dry or there is a nutrient

953
00:42:09,639 --> 00:42:15,519
deficiency what it's trying to do is

954
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:18,240
protect itself from collecting more Sun

955
00:42:15,519 --> 00:42:22,159
than it can use and then being photo

956
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:24,479
bleached right or um becoming even more

957
00:42:22,159 --> 00:42:26,318
nutrient deficient because it's trying

958
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,719
to keep up with the rate of

959
00:42:26,318 --> 00:42:31,159
photosynthesis

960
00:42:27,719 --> 00:42:34,399
that it could be doing um with the par

961
00:42:31,159 --> 00:42:37,679
that's available and so in that case if

962
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:39,680
you're growing if you have LED lights um

963
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:42,919
and you have dimming controls and I

964
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:44,598
would turn it down um so that the plants

965
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:47,280
don't burn themselves I mean there are

966
00:42:44,599 --> 00:42:48,680
some plants I'm actually curious about

967
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:51,160
some of the purpling Cannabis I don't

968
00:42:48,679 --> 00:42:53,318
know if anyone has tested this but you

969
00:42:51,159 --> 00:42:57,199
know like if you look at like red kale

970
00:42:53,318 --> 00:43:01,279
or red leaf lettuce um that red pigment

971
00:42:57,199 --> 00:43:04,759
is anthocyan and uh the sci scientific

972
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:07,000
Community um basically agrees that that

973
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:11,079
is the plant's own

974
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:15,159
sunscreen uh that that red pigment only

975
00:43:11,079 --> 00:43:18,760
gets activated when the plant is exposed

976
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:20,679
to ultraviolet light and so it produces

977
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:22,960
its own sunscreen it doesn't have to go

978
00:43:20,679 --> 00:43:26,519
out and buy some beach bomb or you know

979
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:28,440
some I don't know uh why can't I think

980
00:43:26,519 --> 00:43:31,800
it must be winter cuz I can't think of

981
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:35,400
any uh product names for uh

982
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:37,960
sunscreen yeah uh and so that's probably

983
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:42,838
what the plant is doing is protecting

984
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:46,159
itself from um overproducing right it

985
00:43:42,838 --> 00:43:48,000
from overc consuming itself um because

986
00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:49,719
what will happen kind of like what

987
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,199
happens with humans if we're nutrient

988
00:43:49,719 --> 00:43:54,399
deficiency deficient then we start

989
00:43:52,199 --> 00:43:58,039
pulling from our bones right we start

990
00:43:54,400 --> 00:44:00,880
pulling uh protein from our muscles and

991
00:43:58,039 --> 00:44:04,199
you know we deteriorate ourselves to

992
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:05,720
keep our vital organs going and so the

993
00:44:04,199 --> 00:44:07,879
same will be true for plants is that

994
00:44:05,719 --> 00:44:11,199
they're going to pull from wherever they

995
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:12,920
can to keep their basic functions going

996
00:44:11,199 --> 00:44:16,719
and that's just going to perpetuate the

997
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:18,400
cycle um and so what plants will do um

998
00:44:16,719 --> 00:44:19,879
in some cases is that they will pray

999
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:22,119
they will close their leaves so that

1000
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:23,960
they aren't exposed to so much sunlight

1001
00:44:22,119 --> 00:44:26,559
so that they're not sort of forced I

1002
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:28,519
guess um to photosynthesize I don't know

1003
00:44:26,559 --> 00:44:31,359
if they have another mechanism I'm sure

1004
00:44:28,519 --> 00:44:36,679
they do um to slow or stop the

1005
00:44:31,358 --> 00:44:36,679
photosynthesis process um

1006
00:44:56,039 --> 00:45:00,039
but for

1007
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:34,000
you're back there you are there you are

1008
00:45:32,358 --> 00:45:37,000
okay I didn't know what

1009
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,960
happened I kept talking I didn't I

1010
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:42,199
didn't notice you were looking at me

1011
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:42,199
slowly until I finished

1012
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:48,200
talking now you're back again okay do

1013
00:45:46,679 --> 00:45:50,078
you think you got that recorded what I

1014
00:45:48,199 --> 00:45:51,519
said I don't know because it is

1015
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:56,000
recording

1016
00:45:51,519 --> 00:45:57,679
locally so hopefully okay yeah if not

1017
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,358
then we'll come back praying plants

1018
00:45:57,679 --> 00:46:01,639
another time well I have other questions

1019
00:45:59,358 --> 00:46:02,880
about it actually so I'd like to

1020
00:46:01,639 --> 00:46:05,279
continue because I know we're going to

1021
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:07,640
get a lot of push back on what you said

1022
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:10,240
okay but you don't know what I said do

1023
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:11,719
you well you were well I caught some of

1024
00:46:10,239 --> 00:46:15,479
it so basically you were saying that it

1025
00:46:11,719 --> 00:46:17,679
was a plant response to limit light due

1026
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:20,199
to other environmental

1027
00:46:17,679 --> 00:46:22,239
stresses yeah basically so that it can

1028
00:46:20,199 --> 00:46:25,519
reduce or slow its

1029
00:46:22,239 --> 00:46:27,439
photosynthetic rate um and one of the

1030
00:46:25,519 --> 00:46:29,639
things I mentioned is that you know

1031
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:31,838
plants will kind of do what humans do

1032
00:46:29,639 --> 00:46:34,598
where you know humans if we're nutrient

1033
00:46:31,838 --> 00:46:38,239
deficient um we'll start pulling right

1034
00:46:34,599 --> 00:46:40,838
nutrients from our bones right calcium

1035
00:46:38,239 --> 00:46:42,519
from our bones protein and amino acids

1036
00:46:40,838 --> 00:46:44,639
from our muscles right and so our body

1037
00:46:42,519 --> 00:46:48,199
will start to deteriorate in order to

1038
00:46:44,639 --> 00:46:50,239
keep our basic organ functions working

1039
00:46:48,199 --> 00:46:53,279
right and so plants might do the same

1040
00:46:50,239 --> 00:46:55,679
right if they are you know really active

1041
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:58,119
and you know are photosynthesizing more

1042
00:46:55,679 --> 00:47:01,799
than they're in environment or their

1043
00:46:58,119 --> 00:47:04,200
nutrients or water can support them um

1044
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:06,440
then you know they would start pulling

1045
00:47:04,199 --> 00:47:09,558
um from various places to keep their

1046
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:11,960
basic functions going but plants have a

1047
00:47:09,559 --> 00:47:14,720
mechanism in order to protect themselves

1048
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:17,440
from that which is to you know close

1049
00:47:14,719 --> 00:47:20,118
their leaves so that they're not

1050
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:23,599
exposed um you know the chlorophyll is

1051
00:47:20,119 --> 00:47:25,440
not exposed to to photosynthetically

1052
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:28,640
active

1053
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:31,920
radiation okay that makes sense to me

1054
00:47:28,639 --> 00:47:35,199
except for to play Devil's Advocate we

1055
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:37,680
also see plants

1056
00:47:35,199 --> 00:47:40,558
pray um

1057
00:47:37,679 --> 00:47:42,440
typically when uh well at night they'll

1058
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:45,240
tend to droop and then they'll perk back

1059
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:47,880
up you know when the day starts uh so

1060
00:47:45,239 --> 00:47:49,679
that light level increase um or that

1061
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:52,559
transition from night to day we'll see

1062
00:47:49,679 --> 00:47:54,679
it or if we do certain nutrient

1063
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:57,359
applications or on really happy healthy

1064
00:47:54,679 --> 00:47:59,440
plants so for many Growers I would say

1065
00:47:57,358 --> 00:48:01,759
the standard of a healthy plant is when

1066
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:04,200
they do some sort of application or

1067
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:08,160
intervention and the plant leaves prey

1068
00:48:04,199 --> 00:48:12,078
um so I feel like there are multiple

1069
00:48:08,159 --> 00:48:14,598
variables or mechanisms that can cause

1070
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:16,559
this Leaf angle and some of them are

1071
00:48:14,599 --> 00:48:19,280
quite positive potentially and some of

1072
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:21,640
them may not be but that we can't

1073
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:23,880
necessarily use it as a diagnosis to say

1074
00:48:21,639 --> 00:48:27,000
this is a healthy plant or this is a

1075
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:30,200
unhealthy plant I don't think so yeah I

1076
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:33,719
mean I don't know that I would consider

1077
00:48:30,199 --> 00:48:38,279
a Praying plant healthy or

1078
00:48:33,719 --> 00:48:40,838
unhealthy um you know it might just be a

1079
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:43,800
protective mechanism that could just be

1080
00:48:40,838 --> 00:48:47,279
temporary that is doesn't necessarily

1081
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:49,079
indicate it is temporary yeah exactly

1082
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:51,680
that it doesn't necessarily indicate

1083
00:48:49,079 --> 00:48:54,200
that there is something um systemically

1084
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:58,039
wrong with the plant or or how you're

1085
00:48:54,199 --> 00:49:02,519
growing the plant um it also you

1086
00:48:58,039 --> 00:49:04,759
know could be that the plant is

1087
00:49:02,519 --> 00:49:07,960
protecting itself I mean I I'm just

1088
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:11,680
thinking about in California poppies

1089
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:14,318
like close at night and then open during

1090
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:16,598
the daytime and I think one of those

1091
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:20,279
mechanisms is to protect itself from

1092
00:49:16,599 --> 00:49:24,559
from frost um and from insects and from

1093
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:28,519
other you know uh environmental hazards

1094
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:30,760
um at night um when it's not active uh

1095
00:49:28,519 --> 00:49:33,079
so I could see that being you know

1096
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:35,760
something the other thing is you know if

1097
00:49:33,079 --> 00:49:37,599
if a plant is praying at night it could

1098
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:40,359
be a a

1099
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:43,599
respiration uh mechanism so you know

1100
00:49:40,358 --> 00:49:44,920
plants are respiring all the time and

1101
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:49,359
you know are only

1102
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:51,480
photosynthesizing during the day and so

1103
00:49:49,358 --> 00:49:53,639
photosynthesis exceeds the rate of

1104
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:56,719
respiration during the daytime hour so

1105
00:49:53,639 --> 00:49:58,440
we see you know um an an excess of

1106
00:49:56,719 --> 00:50:00,719
oxygen getting produced during the

1107
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:03,200
daytime but at night time we actually

1108
00:50:00,719 --> 00:50:06,118
you know see more carbon dioxide getting

1109
00:50:03,199 --> 00:50:07,439
let off um by the plant at night uh

1110
00:50:06,119 --> 00:50:09,400
which a lot of people are concerned

1111
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:11,639
about like oh my God my CO2 levels

1112
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:13,680
increased at night is that unhealthy for

1113
00:50:11,639 --> 00:50:16,358
the plant no there has been no

1114
00:50:13,679 --> 00:50:19,598
scientific research to say that high CO2

1115
00:50:16,358 --> 00:50:21,838
levels at night are bad for any any

1116
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:23,760
Horticultural crop so don't worry about

1117
00:50:21,838 --> 00:50:26,119
that and it's a natural process because

1118
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:29,839
plants are always producing CO2 they're

1119
00:50:26,119 --> 00:50:31,920
always resp spiring um and so it could

1120
00:50:29,838 --> 00:50:34,358
be that that shift from

1121
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:37,480
photosynthesis to respiration as being

1122
00:50:34,358 --> 00:50:40,318
the dominant process might also be

1123
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:43,480
affecting um the sort of preying

1124
00:50:40,318 --> 00:50:46,358
mechanism that plants do um even at

1125
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:49,719
night so also it could be a water

1126
00:50:46,358 --> 00:50:52,400
conservation uh mechanism uh you know I

1127
00:50:49,719 --> 00:50:55,279
mean yeah the ston are on the bottom of

1128
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:57,240
the plant so that might seem

1129
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:59,119
counterintuitive but again if we're

1130
00:50:57,239 --> 00:51:02,239
slowing the rate of

1131
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:05,680
photosynthesis um then the stata don't

1132
00:51:02,239 --> 00:51:08,519
have to work as hard uh and so you know

1133
00:51:05,679 --> 00:51:10,000
then they they might be more closed you

1134
00:51:08,519 --> 00:51:13,440
might think they're more open but they

1135
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:16,239
might be more closed um yeah I I like

1136
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:19,318
the theory of increasing access this the

1137
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:23,759
amount of access to CO2 maybe at that

1138
00:51:19,318 --> 00:51:25,279
angle for air flow purposes um but also

1139
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:27,880
other people said maybe it's an actually

1140
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:29,640
an increasing the amount of light that's

1141
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:31,838
able to penetrate into the canopy so

1142
00:51:29,639 --> 00:51:34,159
you're actually getting increased

1143
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:35,960
photosynthesis by having that leaf angle

1144
00:51:34,159 --> 00:51:38,679
because you're getting more light access

1145
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:40,079
to more canopy um I don't know it was

1146
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:42,598
interesting topic I just kind of wanted

1147
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:43,880
to hear what your plants are so smart

1148
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:46,880
we're still learning too and that's the

1149
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:48,960
fun thing about uh that I love about

1150
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:52,318
what we do is we're always learning new

1151
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:54,159
things um so I do have some other

1152
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:58,039
questions I know I kind of got off topic

1153
00:51:54,159 --> 00:52:02,039
there with that one um

1154
00:51:58,039 --> 00:52:04,759
let's talk a little bit about Energy

1155
00:52:02,039 --> 00:52:07,039
Solutions because one of the things I

1156
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:08,559
see and this is something that I am

1157
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:10,558
dealing with so I'll just give you a

1158
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:12,400
real world example as a way to kind of

1159
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:14,839
maybe bring it together for Growers so

1160
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:16,480
like you know I mentioned that I'm in a

1161
00:52:14,838 --> 00:52:18,920
room it's mostly sealed because I don't

1162
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:21,440
have a good lung lung room so if I'm

1163
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:23,280
bringing in air it's it's pretty cold

1164
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:26,119
air this time of year so I want to limit

1165
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:30,040
that but then I also want air exchange

1166
00:52:26,119 --> 00:52:32,160
and my room will get too hot so now I'm

1167
00:52:30,039 --> 00:52:35,558
evacuating my hot air to bring in cold

1168
00:52:32,159 --> 00:52:37,920
air but then I'm losing my CO2 that I've

1169
00:52:35,559 --> 00:52:40,760
generated with either from the plants or

1170
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:43,760
the soil or through artificial means so

1171
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:46,359
it's this dance of like how do I

1172
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:48,160
maintain the temperature and humidity

1173
00:52:46,358 --> 00:52:50,880
that I want in my room and the proper

1174
00:52:48,159 --> 00:52:54,960
air flow and the proper CO2 to match my

1175
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:56,960
light levels uh but at the same time um

1176
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:59,358
keep you know so I don't want to put

1177
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:01,000
for example my temperature is now too

1178
00:52:59,358 --> 00:53:02,920
high I don't want to have to put in an

1179
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:05,159
air conditioner which generates more

1180
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:07,318
energy just to lower the temperature

1181
00:53:05,159 --> 00:53:10,239
with the heat that I've intentionally

1182
00:53:07,318 --> 00:53:12,480
created um do you see this on a you know

1183
00:53:10,239 --> 00:53:14,399
on a larger scale say commercially where

1184
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:16,559
people end up uh essentially your

1185
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:19,039
equipment just fighting

1186
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:21,559
itself equipment is fighting itself all

1187
00:53:19,039 --> 00:53:25,239
the time whether it's CO2 versus Heating

1188
00:53:21,559 --> 00:53:27,640
and Cooling or it's cooling versus

1189
00:53:25,239 --> 00:53:28,959
dehumidification um or it's heating

1190
00:53:27,639 --> 00:53:32,358
versus

1191
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:34,318
dehumidification um I mean that it just

1192
00:53:32,358 --> 00:53:38,239
is kind of the nature of the Beast

1193
00:53:34,318 --> 00:53:41,558
because for one you know we're asking

1194
00:53:38,239 --> 00:53:45,479
equipment to

1195
00:53:41,559 --> 00:53:50,359
manage energy within the space which we

1196
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:52,880
call a load um that varies over time it

1197
00:53:50,358 --> 00:53:56,199
varies from hour to hour it varies from

1198
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:58,160
day to night it varies from week to week

1199
00:53:56,199 --> 00:53:59,439
right and so we're asking equipment to

1200
00:53:58,159 --> 00:54:03,279
do all this

1201
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:04,920
work and and find the right balance um

1202
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:09,480
so that we can hit our temperature

1203
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:13,519
humidity CO2 light everything targets um

1204
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:13,519
so you know on your specific

1205
00:54:14,599 --> 00:54:21,440
example when it comes to carbon

1206
00:54:17,239 --> 00:54:21,439
dioxide and conditioning a

1207
00:54:21,559 --> 00:54:28,519
space one trick that you can do is okay

1208
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:33,280
so let's say you have a it's a beautiful

1209
00:54:28,519 --> 00:54:35,960
day let's say it's like 65° outside and

1210
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:37,640
the relative humidity is like 30 or 40

1211
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:40,760
or

1212
00:54:37,639 --> 00:54:43,159
50% and you know inside you're trying to

1213
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:47,000
maintain it to be 80° and I don't know

1214
00:54:43,159 --> 00:54:50,279
65% relative humidity so you know that

1215
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:53,679
you can use that outside air to cool and

1216
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:55,599
dehumidify uh your space and so you're

1217
00:54:53,679 --> 00:54:57,239
like oh great I don't have to turn on an

1218
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:59,079
air conditioner I don't have to turn on

1219
00:54:57,239 --> 00:55:02,558
a dehumidifier I don't have to turn on a

1220
00:54:59,079 --> 00:55:05,760
heater and I can just ventilate this

1221
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:08,240
space but you're like but I also want to

1222
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:11,119
enrich this space with carbon dioxide to

1223
00:55:08,239 --> 00:55:13,719
hit you know a, or 1300 parts per

1224
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:15,720
million I'm just going to dump all that

1225
00:55:13,719 --> 00:55:19,719
CO2

1226
00:55:15,719 --> 00:55:19,719
outside right

1227
00:55:33,679 --> 00:55:38,480
trying to keep up with with how much

1228
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:42,039
happening is usually first thing in the

1229
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:47,000
morning so when when the lights turn

1230
00:55:42,039 --> 00:55:50,520
on and your plants wake up if you

1231
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:53,400
enrich that room with carbon dioxide for

1232
00:55:50,519 --> 00:55:56,358
that first hour or two before you need

1233
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:59,160
before the plants are transpiring really

1234
00:55:56,358 --> 00:56:03,078
hard before heat really builds up in

1235
00:55:59,159 --> 00:56:06,879
your Greenhouse or in your grow um then

1236
00:56:03,079 --> 00:56:09,640
you can still get a really big benefit

1237
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:14,280
from enriching that space with CO2 for

1238
00:56:09,639 --> 00:56:16,400
just 30 minutes to a couple of hours um

1239
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:18,400
in fact a lot of research with other

1240
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:21,280
Horticultural crops has shown that just

1241
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:24,318
by by enriching for the first hour

1242
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:26,960
before you vent has an increase in yield

1243
00:56:24,318 --> 00:56:30,159
for example Tomatoes of 10 to 15%

1244
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:33,240
% just for that that's a short period of

1245
00:56:30,159 --> 00:56:35,480
time and if you think about it it's it's

1246
00:56:33,239 --> 00:56:38,558
like your plants when they wake up are

1247
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:41,159
taking this big Breath Right like think

1248
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:43,079
about when you wake up right I know I

1249
00:56:41,159 --> 00:56:45,159
catch myself every morning it's like I

1250
00:56:43,079 --> 00:56:48,519
know that I'm awake when I take that

1251
00:56:45,159 --> 00:56:50,480
that big gulp of air in the morning I'm

1252
00:56:48,519 --> 00:56:52,440
like okay I'm awake I'm ready to go now

1253
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:53,960
that I've done that um and it's the same

1254
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:57,200
is true with your plants your plants are

1255
00:56:53,960 --> 00:57:00,039
going to use the most CO2

1256
00:56:57,199 --> 00:57:02,679
right when they're first kind of waking

1257
00:57:00,039 --> 00:57:05,599
up and then you could do the same at the

1258
00:57:02,679 --> 00:57:07,960
end of the day right um as maybe you're

1259
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:11,160
turning down your lights um and your

1260
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:13,079
plants are still photosynthesizing still

1261
00:57:11,159 --> 00:57:15,679
transpiring even after you turn the

1262
00:57:13,079 --> 00:57:19,160
lights off it takes about 30 minutes for

1263
00:57:15,679 --> 00:57:20,960
your plants to acclimate um after you

1264
00:57:19,159 --> 00:57:23,159
know the lights turn on or after the

1265
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:25,000
lights turn off and so you know stata

1266
00:57:23,159 --> 00:57:27,078
don't just instantaneously open and

1267
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:29,880
close it takes 15 to 30 minutes for them

1268
00:57:27,079 --> 00:57:31,440
to do that so you could even after you

1269
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:33,358
turn off the lights and there's still

1270
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:34,920
all that energy in the room and the

1271
00:57:33,358 --> 00:57:38,440
stomata are still

1272
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:40,960
open enrich with CO2 pump that room with

1273
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:44,079
carbon dioxide and get it into those

1274
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:45,920
those stomates um and a you know they're

1275
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:47,280
going to be slowing their photosynthetic

1276
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:50,358
process but you're going to be giving

1277
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:53,839
that CO2 to kind of boost give it a

1278
00:57:50,358 --> 00:57:55,880
boost um so so that's one recommendation

1279
00:57:53,838 --> 00:57:58,759
that we give to everyone is look before

1280
00:57:55,880 --> 00:58:01,079
you turn on those exhaust fans before

1281
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:04,319
you open that economizer or or let in

1282
00:58:01,079 --> 00:58:07,640
outside air enrich with CO2 but then

1283
00:58:04,318 --> 00:58:10,279
turn it off and you know unfortunately

1284
00:58:07,639 --> 00:58:12,798
our you know ambient CO2 levels are

1285
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:14,519
increasing all the time and so you're

1286
00:58:12,798 --> 00:58:18,318
still going to get a good you know

1287
00:58:14,519 --> 00:58:21,559
you're never going to deplete um uh your

1288
00:58:18,318 --> 00:58:23,920
room of carbon dioxide um if you're

1289
00:58:21,559 --> 00:58:25,880
using fresh air you're just going to be

1290
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:28,000
limited to whatever it is outside which

1291
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:29,280
right now is about 400 parts per million

1292
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:33,000
which is you

1293
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:35,519
know more than maybe we want it to be as

1294
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:37,239
humans yeah I want to uh I want to just

1295
00:58:35,519 --> 00:58:41,318
reiterate so you were saying that there

1296
00:58:37,239 --> 00:58:42,239
is research to support this idea of just

1297
00:58:41,318 --> 00:58:46,159
adding

1298
00:58:42,239 --> 00:58:48,118
CO2 for the first hour of the light

1299
00:58:46,159 --> 00:58:50,239
cycle and maybe again the first hour of

1300
00:58:48,119 --> 00:58:51,798
the dark cycle and seeing increases in

1301
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:53,639
tomatoes that's that's a big one right

1302
00:58:51,798 --> 00:58:56,599
there for people especially in green

1303
00:58:53,639 --> 00:58:58,239
houses or other environments um

1304
00:58:56,599 --> 00:59:00,039
one thing I would add if you are

1305
00:58:58,239 --> 00:59:03,759
bringing in outside air just a friendly

1306
00:59:00,039 --> 00:59:06,440
reminder to filter it um yes or use

1307
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:09,240
something to limit the intake of

1308
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:13,318
pathogens and insects I know you

1309
00:59:09,239 --> 00:59:15,798
recommend uh M filter uh versus a HEPA

1310
00:59:13,318 --> 00:59:19,279
filter do you want to just touch on that

1311
00:59:15,798 --> 00:59:23,798
really quick sure sure of course um so

1312
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:27,599
all you really need is a MV 11 filter to

1313
00:59:23,798 --> 00:59:29,239
filter out mold pores and everything

1314
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:30,519
bigger than that and so you know

1315
00:59:29,239 --> 00:59:36,078
everything bigger than that is going to

1316
00:59:30,519 --> 00:59:37,920
be pollen insects right dander dust um

1317
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:39,519
and so but really what you're probably

1318
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:42,200
most concerned about are insects and

1319
00:59:39,519 --> 00:59:44,920
mold spores and a Merv 11 filter is

1320
00:59:42,199 --> 00:59:47,358
plenty what we usually recommend for an

1321
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:49,798
air conditioning system is if you can

1322
00:59:47,358 --> 00:59:52,679
put two filters in series with each

1323
00:59:49,798 --> 00:59:55,038
other one right after the other a merate

1324
00:59:52,679 --> 00:59:56,879
filter um which will screen out the

1325
00:59:55,039 --> 01:00:00,160
insects and the Dust dust and the pollen

1326
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:02,838
and the big stuff um and then a MV 11 or

1327
01:00:00,159 --> 01:00:05,118
13 filter after that which can then

1328
01:00:02,838 --> 01:00:08,798
focus on filtering out the smaller stuff

1329
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:12,240
like the mold spores um and so that's

1330
01:00:08,798 --> 01:00:15,480
all you really need uh for your growth

1331
01:00:12,239 --> 01:00:19,000
space and and just to touch on why not

1332
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:23,519
HEPA filters HEPA filters are designed

1333
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:26,599
to filter out very small um particles so

1334
01:00:23,519 --> 01:00:31,280
viruses and bacteria are are good

1335
01:00:26,599 --> 01:00:35,599
examples of that and all plant viruses

1336
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:38,359
are Soil and Water born they are or or

1337
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:40,200
by surface uh they are not Airborne

1338
01:00:38,358 --> 01:00:43,480
they're spread by so if you are using a

1339
01:00:40,199 --> 01:00:46,598
HEPA filter thinking that you are

1340
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:48,480
filtering out viruses and bacteria

1341
01:00:46,599 --> 01:00:51,640
that's going to infect the surface of

1342
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:54,679
your plant you're not um you what you

1343
01:00:51,639 --> 01:00:59,159
are doing is maybe helping you know um

1344
01:00:54,679 --> 01:01:01,480
filter out virus is uh for your staff um

1345
01:00:59,159 --> 01:01:03,960
so the cold virus the corona viruses and

1346
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:06,599
flu viruses aren't circulating around

1347
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:08,280
but that's not going to help your plants

1348
01:01:06,599 --> 01:01:11,119
at all what's going to help your plants

1349
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:13,680
is having good water filtration um and

1350
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:16,039
good you know hygienic practices of of

1351
01:01:13,679 --> 01:01:18,239
cutting and pruning and and managing

1352
01:01:16,039 --> 01:01:18,240
your

1353
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:25,319
plants okay one last CO2 question for

1354
01:01:22,318 --> 01:01:26,440
the podcast um so for people that are

1355
01:01:25,318 --> 01:01:28,119
not

1356
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:30,720
supplementing

1357
01:01:28,119 --> 01:01:32,680
CO2 how much air exchange do we need cuz

1358
01:01:30,719 --> 01:01:34,679
I think of people who have for example a

1359
01:01:32,679 --> 01:01:36,399
grow tent and maybe that air is just

1360
01:01:34,679 --> 01:01:38,719
sitting in that grow tent and

1361
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:40,920
circulating and because they don't maybe

1362
01:01:38,719 --> 01:01:42,439
for Odor Control or just the way they

1363
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:44,280
have set up they don't have enough maybe

1364
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:47,960
they just have a passive air intake into

1365
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:50,200
the space um what sort of

1366
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:53,519
limitations like I know with my room if

1367
01:01:50,199 --> 01:01:56,919
I if I don't if I don't bring in air

1368
01:01:53,519 --> 01:01:58,440
I'll get down into the 300s for CO2 and

1369
01:01:56,920 --> 01:02:03,240
I have to assume when I'm down in those

1370
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:06,599
levels that my plant is struggling to uh

1371
01:02:03,239 --> 01:02:09,159
grow efficiently given the light levels

1372
01:02:06,599 --> 01:02:13,960
being at 900 a th000

1373
01:02:09,159 --> 01:02:16,199
ppfd um I'm not I'm not maximizing my

1374
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:18,679
growth potential there and coot too

1375
01:02:16,199 --> 01:02:22,199
would be the limiting factor so if we as

1376
01:02:18,679 --> 01:02:24,239
we move to you know a more sealed

1377
01:02:22,199 --> 01:02:27,239
environment how important is that

1378
01:02:24,239 --> 01:02:27,239
supplementation

1379
01:02:27,358 --> 01:02:35,960
yeah I mean wow there are this is a very

1380
01:02:32,159 --> 01:02:38,118
multi-pronged answer s okay no well it I

1381
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:40,199
mean it depends on so many factors you

1382
01:02:38,119 --> 01:02:42,240
know first off it depends on how many

1383
01:02:40,199 --> 01:02:44,759
plants you have right I mean do you have

1384
01:02:42,239 --> 01:02:48,719
one plant do you have a thousand plants

1385
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:51,160
right because that's going to affect how

1386
01:02:48,719 --> 01:02:55,000
much CO2 those plants are going to

1387
01:02:51,159 --> 01:02:56,318
sequester and use um and and so that's

1388
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:59,278
the first question this second question

1389
01:02:56,318 --> 01:03:01,000
is how old is your plant right a younger

1390
01:02:59,278 --> 01:03:04,798
plant is going to use less carbon

1391
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:08,239
dioxide than an older plant um and so

1392
01:03:04,798 --> 01:03:11,679
you know just those two factors alone

1393
01:03:08,239 --> 01:03:14,199
have a big impact on how much um CO2

1394
01:03:11,679 --> 01:03:17,318
enrichment you need or you know just

1395
01:03:14,199 --> 01:03:20,598
with the rate really of what the rate of

1396
01:03:17,318 --> 01:03:23,000
CO2 uptake is by the plant so you know

1397
01:03:20,599 --> 01:03:25,838
how much either you know ambient 400

1398
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:29,358
part per million air you need to add or

1399
01:03:25,838 --> 01:03:30,798
how much you know enrichment you need uh

1400
01:03:29,358 --> 01:03:34,119
what the rate of enrichment needs to be

1401
01:03:30,798 --> 01:03:35,519
to achieve say a th parts per million um

1402
01:03:34,119 --> 01:03:37,200
but then there's other factors right all

1403
01:03:35,519 --> 01:03:39,519
the environmental factors we're pushing

1404
01:03:37,199 --> 01:03:42,639
plants with high light levels we're

1405
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:46,159
pushing plants right with maybe higher

1406
01:03:42,639 --> 01:03:49,358
temperatures um and so those two factors

1407
01:03:46,159 --> 01:03:51,759
um light and temperature um affect the

1408
01:03:49,358 --> 01:03:53,440
rate of photosynthesis so if you have

1409
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:55,000
really high light and really high

1410
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:57,480
temperatures I say really high

1411
01:03:55,000 --> 01:04:01,358
temperatures Maybe that's 83 or 85

1412
01:03:57,480 --> 01:04:04,240
Degrees um and you have you know 1,500

1413
01:04:01,358 --> 01:04:06,159
ppfd um as your your light levels you're

1414
01:04:04,239 --> 01:04:11,118
going to be pushing those plants a lot

1415
01:04:06,159 --> 01:04:14,719
harder than if you're at 800 ppfd and 75

1416
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:17,480
degrees um you know set point so you

1417
01:04:14,719 --> 01:04:20,759
know the rate of CO2 uptake is going to

1418
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:23,880
depend on both the environmental factors

1419
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:27,119
and your plants uh so I can't really

1420
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:29,200
answer that um spefic specifically but

1421
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:30,519
you know it's a case- by case basis I

1422
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:34,399
guess I would say I don't really have a

1423
01:04:30,519 --> 01:04:37,838
good rule of thumb um except to say that

1424
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:40,200
usually if you assume one air change per

1425
01:04:37,838 --> 01:04:42,480
hour which is very low this is like

1426
01:04:40,199 --> 01:04:46,000
barely doing anything this is basically

1427
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:50,519
just having a a leaky room um that's

1428
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:54,920
usually enough um to manage uh or

1429
01:04:50,519 --> 01:04:57,440
maintain CO2 levels um you know for the

1430
01:04:54,920 --> 01:05:01,519
majority of plant growing environments

1431
01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:05,159
and so one AC has one air exchange of

1432
01:05:01,519 --> 01:05:06,880
between outside and inside air per hour

1433
01:05:05,159 --> 01:05:08,759
and so the way that you figure that out

1434
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:11,119
is you you know you measure the square

1435
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:14,520
footage of your space and then you

1436
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:17,440
multiply that by the height of the room

1437
01:05:14,519 --> 01:05:19,278
and that's your volume um and so you

1438
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:22,358
want one

1439
01:05:19,278 --> 01:05:25,358
volume to turn over with the outside air

1440
01:05:22,358 --> 01:05:28,119
replenish with outside air every hour

1441
01:05:25,358 --> 01:05:30,278
again so if you if you exchange one

1442
01:05:28,119 --> 01:05:34,000
volume of inside air with outside air

1443
01:05:30,278 --> 01:05:38,559
every hour that's usually enough to

1444
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:38,559
maintain you know ambient CO2

1445
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:43,440
levels

1446
01:05:40,519 --> 01:05:46,000
and okay this is my absolute last

1447
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:47,480
question so when I didn't know we were

1448
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:49,119
gonna talk so much about CO2 but I don't

1449
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:51,358
mind it's great yeah no and well this

1450
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:54,640
isn't about CO2 this is more just about

1451
01:05:51,358 --> 01:05:57,558
so if you were if if a company were to

1452
01:05:54,639 --> 01:05:59,519
reach out to you or facility what sort

1453
01:05:57,559 --> 01:06:01,200
of services do you offer around these

1454
01:05:59,519 --> 01:06:03,278
sorts of things so like what does that

1455
01:06:01,199 --> 01:06:05,278
process look like I and because I've

1456
01:06:03,278 --> 01:06:08,000
been in some some of these meetings with

1457
01:06:05,278 --> 01:06:09,920
you as just on the side listening in

1458
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:12,440
sort of a thing

1459
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:15,200
um what sort of services does Dr

1460
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:19,000
Greenhouse offer for facilities what's

1461
01:06:15,199 --> 01:06:20,879
the range yeah so you know again we are

1462
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:23,679
you know mechanical and agricultural

1463
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:25,920
Engineers so and that Focus really on

1464
01:06:23,679 --> 01:06:28,078
environmental control we don't do

1465
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:31,159
irrigation we don't do lighting there's

1466
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:33,278
a lot of you know other special spe

1467
01:06:31,159 --> 01:06:37,199
Specialists uh in those areas including

1468
01:06:33,278 --> 01:06:39,599
utad um and so you know we really focus

1469
01:06:37,199 --> 01:06:43,399
on the air on the aerial environment

1470
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:45,599
around the plant uh and So within that

1471
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:47,838
one thing that we do almost on every

1472
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:50,000
single project whether we're designing

1473
01:06:47,838 --> 01:06:53,038
it all the way through to get a building

1474
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:55,719
permit for your new facility or just

1475
01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:57,359
doing a peer review or a gut check of

1476
01:06:55,719 --> 01:07:00,358
equipment that you're thinking of

1477
01:06:57,358 --> 01:07:02,318
installing in your grow room uh is a

1478
01:07:00,358 --> 01:07:04,519
load calculation and so I mentioned

1479
01:07:02,318 --> 01:07:07,480
earlier we you know we call it you know

1480
01:07:04,519 --> 01:07:10,278
the energy that's in the room we call

1481
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:12,400
the load uh the cooling load the heating

1482
01:07:10,278 --> 01:07:16,318
load because that's what we're then

1483
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:19,920
going to remove or add back into the air

1484
01:07:16,318 --> 01:07:22,960
with our HVAC systems so the very first

1485
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:24,760
thing is we calculate how much heating

1486
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:26,240
cooling and dehumidification or

1487
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:28,480
humidification

1488
01:07:26,239 --> 01:07:30,798
you need based off of what you're

1489
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:33,000
growing what type of Lights you have

1490
01:07:30,798 --> 01:07:35,719
what your irrigation rates are you know

1491
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:37,798
all these sorts of variables um so that

1492
01:07:35,719 --> 01:07:40,318
then we can help you pick the right

1493
01:07:37,798 --> 01:07:42,719
equipment the right size equipment the

1494
01:07:40,318 --> 01:07:45,119
right type of equipment again if you've

1495
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:48,199
picked out you know a dehumidifier and

1496
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:50,640
maybe an air conditioner uh and you want

1497
01:07:48,199 --> 01:07:52,960
to make sure that you got the right size

1498
01:07:50,639 --> 01:07:55,118
um we can calculate what the right size

1499
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:57,519
will be and tell you yep you're on the

1500
01:07:55,119 --> 01:07:59,318
right track or uh you might want to you

1501
01:07:57,519 --> 01:08:00,159
know bump the size up a little bit

1502
01:07:59,318 --> 01:08:02,079
because it's not going to give you

1503
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:05,278
enough dehumidification at your

1504
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:07,039
conditions um you know or it's way

1505
01:08:05,278 --> 01:08:09,000
oversized uh because you know you

1506
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:10,400
weren't sure or the engineer wasn't sure

1507
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:12,599
because they've never done a grow room

1508
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:16,199
before and so you know you can save half

1509
01:08:12,599 --> 01:08:17,960
the price if you just you know get the

1510
01:08:16,198 --> 01:08:19,318
right size equipment which is not going

1511
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:20,520
to just help you with the first cost

1512
01:08:19,319 --> 01:08:21,719
it's going to help you with the

1513
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:24,199
operating cost because you're not going

1514
01:08:21,719 --> 01:08:27,039
to be running right bigger equipment

1515
01:08:24,198 --> 01:08:30,759
that has a a larger electrical or gas

1516
01:08:27,039 --> 01:08:33,759
load um or demand so you know that and

1517
01:08:30,759 --> 01:08:36,560
and we're we do that we do that level of

1518
01:08:33,759 --> 01:08:40,600
work for everything everyone from you

1519
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:46,359
know 500 square foot you know small

1520
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:50,640
grower to you know 50,000 100,000 square

1521
01:08:46,359 --> 01:08:52,199
foot uh you know fancy indoor facilities

1522
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:55,480
um and we've saved our clients probably

1523
01:08:52,198 --> 01:08:57,759
millions of dollars um just doing those

1524
01:08:55,479 --> 01:09:00,119
those two things uh beyond that we're

1525
01:08:57,759 --> 01:09:02,039
hired a lot to help with air flow and to

1526
01:09:00,119 --> 01:09:06,198
help with CO2 enrichment so we can

1527
01:09:02,039 --> 01:09:08,640
actually you know calculate how much CO2

1528
01:09:06,198 --> 01:09:10,759
your plants are going to use so that you

1529
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:13,159
know how much you need to then add if

1530
01:09:10,759 --> 01:09:16,600
you want to enrich the room with

1531
01:09:13,158 --> 01:09:18,439
CO2 um so we can get you dialed into

1532
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:20,759
that number as well so you don't have a

1533
01:09:18,439 --> 01:09:23,039
you know bigger tank outside than you

1534
01:09:20,759 --> 01:09:25,600
need or you know that those canisters

1535
01:09:23,039 --> 01:09:28,000
are going to be enough uh and then you

1536
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:31,279
know on airflow we've been called a lot

1537
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:35,119
more uh recently on helping with airflow

1538
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:38,799
design and improving the air flow

1539
01:09:35,119 --> 01:09:41,599
situation in indoor grows green houses

1540
01:09:38,798 --> 01:09:43,439
you know and you know if you are growing

1541
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:45,560
in multiple

1542
01:09:43,439 --> 01:09:48,238
levels which I'm sure a lot of your

1543
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:50,798
listeners are growing in two or three

1544
01:09:48,238 --> 01:09:54,158
levels whether that's for clone or veg

1545
01:09:50,798 --> 01:09:55,920
or flower you know I mean it gets really

1546
01:09:54,158 --> 01:09:57,839
complicated once you start working in

1547
01:09:55,920 --> 01:10:03,199
three dimensions how do we get air

1548
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:05,840
moving down below and up above and

1549
01:10:03,198 --> 01:10:08,319
through right I mean those are basically

1550
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:11,640
the the three variables that we're

1551
01:10:08,319 --> 01:10:15,279
trying to to manage with airf flow and

1552
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:17,880
you know there are some um prepackaged I

1553
01:10:15,279 --> 01:10:20,599
would say pre-fabricated systems out

1554
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:27,279
there for you know

1555
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:29,360
multi-level uh uh grow racks and

1556
01:10:27,279 --> 01:10:32,639
I wish they were engineered a little bit

1557
01:10:29,359 --> 01:10:35,000
better um and and so we've actually come

1558
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:37,800
through and and and helped Growers to

1559
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:40,719
improve on those systems um and we've

1560
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:42,520
also custom designed those systems you

1561
01:10:40,719 --> 01:10:44,039
know and and the thing about that you

1562
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:46,320
know like if you think about like you

1563
01:10:44,039 --> 01:10:50,198
might spend 20 or

1564
01:10:46,319 --> 01:10:52,759
$30,000 installing like an inra um air

1565
01:10:50,198 --> 01:10:55,319
distribution system

1566
01:10:52,760 --> 01:10:57,760
that you know was designed to make your

1567
01:10:55,319 --> 01:10:59,599
dance dance but they're only dancing in

1568
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:01,760
the middle they're not dancing at the

1569
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:06,039
ends because it wasn't

1570
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:07,679
really engineered I would say and so you

1571
01:11:06,039 --> 01:11:10,039
know like you think you're saving money

1572
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:13,760
because you're not hiring an engineer or

1573
01:11:10,039 --> 01:11:16,560
consultant like us to you know to to do

1574
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:18,880
the calculation and the analysis to tell

1575
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:21,560
you how much air flow you need to move

1576
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:24,440
from end to end to make sure that it's

1577
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:28,080
picking up the right condition of air at

1578
01:11:24,439 --> 01:11:30,479
the other end of the rack um to size the

1579
01:11:28,079 --> 01:11:34,559
ducks or that plenum that's running from

1580
01:11:30,479 --> 01:11:36,519
end to end um but in but again we save

1581
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:39,520
our clients a lot of money by doing that

1582
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:41,880
because we get it right the first time

1583
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:45,159
again it's not over engineered we know

1584
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:46,159
exactly the fan size the duck size and

1585
01:11:45,158 --> 01:11:49,279
we have

1586
01:11:46,158 --> 01:11:52,638
relationships with duct providers who

1587
01:11:49,279 --> 01:11:55,399
will design that duct to our

1588
01:11:52,639 --> 01:11:59,480
specification if we say we want an air

1589
01:11:55,399 --> 01:12:02,960
velocity at the plant level of 75 m/

1590
01:11:59,479 --> 01:12:05,439
second that's what we get from end to

1591
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:08,719
end and so you know you don't have to

1592
01:12:05,439 --> 01:12:10,198
hire a consultant later to fix something

1593
01:12:08,719 --> 01:12:14,079
that you thought you were saving money

1594
01:12:10,198 --> 01:12:18,079
on early um in the in the design and

1595
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:21,119
construction process and you

1596
01:12:18,079 --> 01:12:23,840
know I have a grower you know we have a

1597
01:12:21,119 --> 01:12:27,439
client that we did that it was a single

1598
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:30,360
level we specialty custom designed this

1599
01:12:27,439 --> 01:12:32,759
fabric duct system worked really closely

1600
01:12:30,359 --> 01:12:35,399
you know what angle do we want the the

1601
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:38,039
air to leave what velocity do we want to

1602
01:12:35,399 --> 01:12:41,238
achieve as the plants are growing from

1603
01:12:38,039 --> 01:12:45,479
small to big you know and can we hit all

1604
01:12:41,238 --> 01:12:47,638
angles um on that plant and when they

1605
01:12:45,479 --> 01:12:50,119
first started it up that's all they did

1606
01:12:47,639 --> 01:12:51,679
they just you know used the fabric ducks

1607
01:12:50,119 --> 01:12:54,439
and I walked through and like oh my god

1608
01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:56,119
it feels amazing in here just you know

1609
01:12:54,439 --> 01:12:58,279
when you walk into a room and it just

1610
01:12:56,119 --> 01:13:00,880
feels like butter like you just know it

1611
01:12:58,279 --> 01:13:03,719
feels right right you don't feel a wind

1612
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:05,600
tunnel you don't have air blowing on you

1613
01:13:03,719 --> 01:13:08,880
and then it's not like stagnant and

1614
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:10,600
weird over there it just felt so good

1615
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:13,920
and then they got a new grower and that

1616
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:16,360
new grower was like we need fans and

1617
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:19,600
they just installed fans and now the

1618
01:13:16,359 --> 01:13:22,759
room is in chaos because the fabric

1619
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:25,440
Ducks were designed to do what they were

1620
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:27,199
supposed to do and as soon as they inst

1621
01:13:25,439 --> 01:13:31,119
fans just like I was talking about the

1622
01:13:27,198 --> 01:13:34,000
vaf versus HF fans it created a

1623
01:13:31,119 --> 01:13:35,880
chaotic situation above the plants and

1624
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:38,359
so some plants got a lot of air other

1625
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:40,560
plants didn't get any air the fabric

1626
01:13:38,359 --> 01:13:42,039
ducts were just kind of you know that

1627
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:44,280
air was just getting kind of like

1628
01:13:42,039 --> 01:13:48,079
swirled around without ever hitting the

1629
01:13:44,279 --> 01:13:52,800
canopy you know and so I I

1630
01:13:48,079 --> 01:13:54,800
um asked them right I uh encouraged them

1631
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:58,079
look turn the fans off in one room and

1632
01:13:54,800 --> 01:14:01,079
see if it's any better and they did and

1633
01:13:58,079 --> 01:14:03,800
it was but it's really hard sometimes to

1634
01:14:01,079 --> 01:14:06,079
convince a grower who is used to doing

1635
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:08,800
one thing who didn't maybe have this

1636
01:14:06,079 --> 01:14:10,359
system right in in their previous grow

1637
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:12,719
so you can't really blame them because

1638
01:14:10,359 --> 01:14:14,920
they're not familiar with it they

1639
01:14:12,719 --> 01:14:16,760
weren't there when we designed it all

1640
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:19,119
together and so they're like hey this is

1641
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:21,000
missing right you you asked me like what

1642
01:14:19,119 --> 01:14:22,719
do I see when I walk into a grow room I

1643
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:25,198
bet that grower walked in was like what

1644
01:14:22,719 --> 01:14:27,600
the hell there's no fans in here how are

1645
01:14:25,198 --> 01:14:30,158
you moving air around right and they

1646
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:33,079
didn't ask right they just you know did

1647
01:14:30,158 --> 01:14:35,198
what they did and um and so now they had

1648
01:14:33,079 --> 01:14:37,639
to hire me back to fix the problem that

1649
01:14:35,198 --> 01:14:41,839
they didn't have in the first place uh

1650
01:14:37,639 --> 01:14:45,159
so um anyway you know we we want to help

1651
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:47,600
Growers get things done right the first

1652
01:14:45,158 --> 01:14:50,158
time uh you know like I said I've been

1653
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:53,360
going to a lot of facilities this last

1654
01:14:50,158 --> 01:14:55,679
year helping to um permanently fix

1655
01:14:53,359 --> 01:14:57,439
Band-Aids right cuz so many Growers have

1656
01:14:55,679 --> 01:15:00,639
put Band-Aids on top of Band-Aids we we

1657
01:14:57,439 --> 01:15:02,439
know that situation um or to invest in

1658
01:15:00,639 --> 01:15:06,079
the right control system or the right

1659
01:15:02,439 --> 01:15:08,638
fan system or or reinvest in air

1660
01:15:06,079 --> 01:15:10,840
conditioning because let's face it after

1661
01:15:08,639 --> 01:15:12,719
five or six or seven years like those

1662
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:15,360
units have reached their end of life as

1663
01:15:12,719 --> 01:15:20,399
we've pushed them to run every day

1664
01:15:15,359 --> 01:15:23,079
through snow and and you know humidity

1665
01:15:20,399 --> 01:15:25,319
uh and so you know we're being asked to

1666
01:15:23,079 --> 01:15:27,960
hey you know we had this air condition

1667
01:15:25,319 --> 01:15:30,158
system we are able to get through it

1668
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:32,679
wasn't great now we want you to come

1669
01:15:30,158 --> 01:15:35,158
back and give us the right thing as

1670
01:15:32,679 --> 01:15:37,960
we're considering replacing the old

1671
01:15:35,158 --> 01:15:40,799
equipment um and so you know if we can

1672
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:43,079
get into these facilities and help you

1673
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:44,560
earlier um the better it's going to be

1674
01:15:43,079 --> 01:15:46,000
for you in the end because you're not

1675
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:48,560
going to be banging your head against

1676
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:50,960
the wall like why isn't this working I

1677
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:52,880
don't have the support I you know my

1678
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:54,719
equipment is over cycling and I'm over

1679
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:56,440
and under shooting all the time right

1680
01:15:54,719 --> 01:15:58,319
I'm seeing these spikes in the morning

1681
01:15:56,439 --> 01:16:01,799
and spikes at night when I turn the

1682
01:15:58,319 --> 01:16:06,519
lights on and off um we can help you

1683
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:10,360
manage uh those those variables so that

1684
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:12,600
um it just makes your day easier I I

1685
01:16:10,359 --> 01:16:15,559
mean I hate it when I walk into a grow

1686
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:17,600
facility and that's what the Grower's

1687
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:19,920
job has become is just sitting in front

1688
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:21,719
of a computer screen watching the

1689
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:25,399
temperature and humidity levels

1690
01:16:21,719 --> 01:16:27,600
fluctuate in you know multiple rooms and

1691
01:16:25,399 --> 01:16:30,319
they're trying to like you know flip

1692
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:33,800
switches and turn dials you know whether

1693
01:16:30,319 --> 01:16:35,599
that's you know uh literally or

1694
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:38,719
figuratively at the at the computer

1695
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:40,760
screen or whatever um you know trying to

1696
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:44,399
manage it on almost like a minute by

1697
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:47,320
minute basis yeah that's maddening right

1698
01:16:44,399 --> 01:16:50,158
so um the equipment is out there the

1699
01:16:47,319 --> 01:16:51,920
control systems are out there to to do

1700
01:16:50,158 --> 01:16:55,279
the majority of that work for you so

1701
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:57,480
that you can focus on what it is you

1702
01:16:55,279 --> 01:16:59,000
want to be doing right which is playing

1703
01:16:57,479 --> 01:17:01,718
with nutrient recipes playing with

1704
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:03,800
lighting recipes trying new cultivars

1705
01:17:01,719 --> 01:17:06,840
and strains right like I mean the fun

1706
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:09,279
stuff about uh growing plants growing

1707
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:11,279
cannabis so yeah I I just want to say

1708
01:17:09,279 --> 01:17:14,399
really quickly like I found you over a

1709
01:17:11,279 --> 01:17:16,559
decade ago through canacon because the

1710
01:17:14,399 --> 01:17:19,119
the speaker that was the expert on HVAC

1711
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:21,000
came in and he was referencing you for

1712
01:17:19,119 --> 01:17:22,880
all the research that he was sharing so

1713
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:24,319
I was super excited to go to the source

1714
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:25,760
and meet you and I'm really just

1715
01:17:24,319 --> 01:17:27,238
grateful that you're willing to share

1716
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:30,560
some of the information that you have

1717
01:17:27,238 --> 01:17:33,079
with Growers and uh yeah I hope that we

1718
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:35,120
can catch up again soon but thank you so

01:17:41,719 --> 01:17:46,920
relevant and I know that you talk to a

1724
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:49,079
lot of Growers who have these questions

1725
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:51,600
