1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:06,110
[Music]

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,080
okay we're going to go ahead and install

3
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:11,879
our carrots into our bed here uh as you

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,400
can see now I've got the quick

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:17,359
disconnect coming from the water supply

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:21,039
a brake there and a brake here and our

7
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:22,720
end of line valve um that brake by the

8
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,080
way is totally up to you as far as where

9
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:27,239
you want to put them so that uh whole

10
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:28,799
piece of tubing will come as one piece

11
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:30,198
and then as you lay it out you'll simply

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,559
just cut with a pair of scissors where

13
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:35,079
you want to put your valves and your

14
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:36,079
carrots and uh and so on so first thing

15
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:39,280
we're going to do is we're going to grab

16
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:42,399
a carrot that's been soaking in some

17
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,558
fresh water for about an hour a little

18
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:47,679
bit longer than needed but I like to go

19
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:48,919
a little bit long so that's an hour and

20
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:52,519
what I'm going to do now you have the

21
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:56,359
water level right up to the top as it's

22
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:59,960
upright I'm going to go ahead and screw

23
00:00:56,359 --> 00:01:02,280
that on so it's thumb tight not crazy

24
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:05,280
EAS and then as you'll see it's got the

25
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:10,920
te you already need to go into your

26
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,920
supply line so plug that in

27
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:15,118
there make sure that's

28
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,799
clean the other

29
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:23,039
side and then we'll go ahead and shove

30
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:26,759
that in so you could just see the

31
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,759
top we'll grab other

32
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,840
carrot this one I've already put the C

33
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,719
on put it on

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,319
there make sure we're

35
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:44,959
clean and I like to run kind of Cy caddy

36
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:47,679
corner and opposite so then what we're

37
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:52,000
going to do is we're going

38
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:53,320
to dial this one down tighten it we'll

39
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,078
open this one

40
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:59,038
up and we're going to turn on our water

41
00:01:57,078 --> 00:02:01,839
and there you go the other thing to

42
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:03,799
remember is keep that that last valve

43
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,240
closed you make sure you get your good

44
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:08,039
water coming out of there now this is a

45
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:09,719
pressurized hookup um you might not see

46
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:12,439
this sort of stream coming out of

47
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:15,519
gravity but that's

48
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:17,639
okay I'm going to tighten this down and

49
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:20,640
do the hanging drip which I will show

50
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:23,958
you closeup of in a little

51
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:26,598
bit later on

52
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:31,759
so once we're dialed

53
00:02:26,598 --> 00:02:31,759
in we have our drip little B

54
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,599
more little bit

55
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:43,879
more there we go we'll do two quote

56
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,318
unquote clicks one two and then this one

57
00:02:43,878 --> 00:02:48,759
we'll just leave for

58
00:02:45,318 --> 00:02:51,759
there and then you have your little blue

59
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:55,079
mat caps and these are great because

60
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:58,519
they sit and snap

61
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:02,760
on and that way if anything gets bumped

62
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:05,799
you're good now the next step is going

63
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:07,479
to be to inst install your drip tape the

64
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:11,360
fitting you're going to be working with

65
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:14,280
is this 3 mm by drip tape adapter I'll

66
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:17,959
show you how to screw this on in

67
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:19,479
another video as well so this simply

68
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:21,000
just gets plugged

69
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:23,119
into

70
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,560
here and then you would route this

71
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,560
around whatever you're

72
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:34,159
planting and then if you've got a steak

73
00:03:32,598 --> 00:03:37,878
lying

74
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:40,280
around which we will make sure you do

75
00:03:37,878 --> 00:03:40,959
put one on the middle there and I like

76
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,919
to

77
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,080
throw one on the

78
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:47,280
end and that's kind of it we can do the

79
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,280
other

80
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,360
carrot this one go

81
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,680
here and then similarly just wrap kind

82
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:02,920
of equal and

83
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,920
opposite and that would be about

84
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:08,479
it so as you can kind of see you're

85
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,000
going to make sure that you've got your

86
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:13,078
edges covered and you've got a nice

87
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,799
middle line to have irrigation through

88
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:17,199
the middle of the bed but most of your

89
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,319
evapo transpiration is going to come

90
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,680
from The Edge which is why it's nice to

91
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:24,519
have those blue soak drip tapes making

92
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,519
sure that they're covered

93
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,478
there all right I want to show everybody

94
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,280
what I was talking about when we're

95
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:34,279
talking about dialing in your sensor or

96
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:35,879
your carrot cuz they kind of look like

97
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:38,519
carrots I'm at my desk there's no water

98
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:40,439
hooked up here but if you would imagine

99
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:43,319
unscrewing this to the point where you

100
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:45,319
can move this freely through there then

101
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:47,279
you'd have some water coming out there

102
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:48,839
pretty steadily so what we're going to

103
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:50,918
do when we're actually setting these up

104
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:55,000
is we'll hold this flat parallel to the

105
00:04:50,918 --> 00:04:56,560
ground and we'll tighten this valve down

106
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,879
until we have what we like to call that

107
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:02,160
hanging drip which is a drip coming out

108
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:06,439
of here about once every 1 to 3 seconds

109
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:08,160
once you have that you can use any you

110
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:10,719
know marker on the side of this cap this

111
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:14,840
fin is a really great one and then

112
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:17,080
you're going to tighten down this valve

113
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:18,839
to what I like to call clicks and a

114
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:20,359
click is there's basically these

115
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:22,119
triangles that surround the top of the

116
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,120
valve so we would tighten

117
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:27,560
one and

118
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:31,360
two and that's a neutral setting so then

119
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:34,759
we would take those cool caps

120
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,520
and those big gaps go around the hose

121
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:38,560
and that way if it gets

122
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:39,560
knocked nothing's going to adjust it

123
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,478
you're not going to flood or you're not

124
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,800
going to cut off irrigation so that's

125
00:05:41,478 --> 00:05:46,758
how to properly set for a neutral

126
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,079
setting your carrot now if you need to

127
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:50,520
make an

128
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:52,680
adjustment remember if you're going even

129
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:56,000
between half of these two triangles

130
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:59,199
these clicks that's a 25% adjustment

131
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,240
right there which is a lot so if you do

132
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,960
need to dial it up if it needs to be

133
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,478
wetter then you would back it off if it

134
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:07,519
needs to be drier you would tighten it

135
00:06:05,478 --> 00:06:10,439
down a little bit more I would recommend

136
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:13,639
not going more than half a click for any

137
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:15,120
one adjustment because if you do that's

138
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:18,560
you could get into some trouble as far

139
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:22,399
as uh over or under irrigating also make

140
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:24,598
sure that you leave enough time I'd say

141
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:26,638
at least a few days to see how these

142
00:06:24,598 --> 00:06:27,639
different adjustments you would make

143
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:31,918
would

144
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:31,918
work before you uh adjust

145
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:37,119
again all right I wanted to show you

146
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:40,439
guys how to hook up your end of line

147
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:43,199
flush valve um there's also a note here

148
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:46,319
that if you do get the pressure kit with

149
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:48,038
the pressure reducer then this collar is

150
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,520
the same on the pressure reducer as it

151
00:06:48,038 --> 00:06:52,519
is on the on the valve so to do that all

152
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:55,000
you do is to take this collar all the

153
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:58,399
way off it

154
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,560
unscrews thread that through

155
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:03,478
there and then that gets fitted on top

156
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,879
of that so that's nice and snug and then

157
00:07:03,478 --> 00:07:07,038
you just throw that back on tighten it

158
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:09,720
all the way

159
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:11,719
down and there you go now if you are

160
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,400
using this as your end of line valve

161
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,680
then nothing would go here but if you

162
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:17,519
needed to check your pressure or make

163
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,280
sure that you do have water flowing you

164
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:21,878
would just turn that going that way

165
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:24,079
water would flow through and then you'd

166
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:25,960
be able to check additionally if you

167
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:28,120
ever need to expand your system add

168
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:29,560
another container or two um all you

169
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:32,360
would need to do is do the same same

170
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:34,280
thing on this side I pull that off put

171
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,160
the other supply line on this end collar

172
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:38,719
it back on and then this valve would

173
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,360
just stay open and then you would let uh

174
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,120
you would irrigate any containers

175
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,120
Downstream from

176
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:51,158
here all right I'm going to show you

177
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:53,519
guys how to hook up any of your blue

178
00:07:51,158 --> 00:07:56,959
soak drip tape fittings this one here is

179
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:59,959
a 3 mm to drip tape adapter and then

180
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:01,399
this one here is your end plug which is

181
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:02,839
basically just the other end to make

182
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:05,399
sure water doesn't just come flowing out

183
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:06,719
of there but we'll use this one uh to

184
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:09,638
get that started you want to make sure

185
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,400
that this ring is all the way buted up

186
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:14,560
against where it was so you can't see

187
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:17,439
any of those threads so like that uh the

188
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:20,680
drip tape will have this kind of thin on

189
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:23,279
here the trick here is to fold that down

190
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:25,360
and you need to then throw that in but

191
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:28,198
this direction needs to be pointed needs

192
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,680
to be folded in the same direction that

193
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:32,800
you're threading your cap on otherwise

194
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,639
you'll get a leak so don't be too scared

195
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:36,240
to really clamp this one down so I'll

196
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:39,479
hold this and then I'll actually twist

197
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,038
this one so that's pretty tight and then

198
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:43,320
you also want to give it a good check so

199
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:45,319
I'm pulling on that pretty good it's not

200
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:47,800
going anywhere other end of the drip

201
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:50,000
tape would be the same just with this

202
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:52,120
plug make sure you're all the way up

203
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,480
against that side throw it on there fold

204
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,799
that flap in the same direction you're

205
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:58,200
twisting tighten her down give it a pull

206
00:08:55,799 --> 00:09:01,199
test and you're good to

207
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,200
go
