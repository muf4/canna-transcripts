00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:26,039
start with that anything you want to add

57
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:30,878
Suzanne well I am super excited too

58
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:34,399
because a Montana B Montana I uh I

59
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:37,159
always love going to Montana um also um

60
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:40,200
I've been out to collected elevation and

61
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:42,000
um they've always been super awesome so

62
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:45,399
um I think it's going to be a lot of fun

63
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,840
a lot of good education um I'm excited

64
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,519
to be giv the opportunity to actually

65
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:52,719
teach a workshop more interactive with

66
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:55,560
the Cannabis scowers because often times

67
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:57,639
I'm just doing a presentation but this I

68
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:01,000
want to be a bit more interactive that

69
00:02:57,639 --> 00:03:02,679
we're going to do on Friday so I think

70
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,519
it's it's going to be great and I'm

71
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:09,360
really looking forward to

72
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:13,039
it awesome awesome well as we dive into

73
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,200
this podcast I know uh there's a we're

74
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:16,560
kind of going to jump around a little

75
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:20,878
bit on topics one of the things I wanted

76
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:23,319
to touch on briefly because I in my

77
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:26,479
indoor garden this year I've never had

78
00:03:23,318 --> 00:03:28,079
an issue with um I've been calling them

79
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:32,359
isopods but we should probably touch on

80
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:36,560
that too these uh woodlouse roly poly

81
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:39,040
armadillo like creatures I'll let you

82
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:42,719
pronounce the scientific or the Latin

83
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:44,798
names um but because of the amount of

84
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:47,639
organic matter in my soil and I don't

85
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:50,920
use I I'm in raised beds and I'm not

86
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:54,559
using a cover crop or a mulch and we can

87
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:58,199
touch on that as well too but I posted

88
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:00,438
about them and I saw a whole list of

89
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:03,759
comments replying to them everything

90
00:04:00,438 --> 00:04:05,438
ranging from you need to feed them

91
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:06,878
separate from your plants so they don't

92
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:09,359
attack your plants but this seems to be

93
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:13,158
a problem that's pretty common among

94
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,920
living soil Growers from time to time uh

95
00:04:13,158 --> 00:04:16,680
typically the ones that I see having

96
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:19,439
this problem are ones that have mulches

97
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,560
or cover crops I don't see it as much

98
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:24,680
with people like myself who just have

99
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:28,079
bare soil and are not using those

100
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:29,879
practices but um yeah some of the

101
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:32,839
suggestions were everything from you

102
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:34,680
know squash or pumpkin or beer traps to

103
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:36,198
kind of Mast trap or collect them in one

104
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,680
spot or feed them separate from your

105
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:41,520
cannabis plants um other people are

106
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:43,519
putting sticky tape or wraps around the

107
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:46,319
stock of their plant is a way of keeping

108
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:50,159
the plant the insects from walking up

109
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:51,360
the plant or girdling the stem um so

110
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,160
we've seeing a bunch of different

111
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,879
suggestions around how to deal with them

112
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:59,280
one one of the suggestions was a pyganic

113
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:00,959
5.0 which is a pyin and I definitely

114
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:04,799
want to talk to you about

115
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:08,198
pyrin um what are your thoughts okay

116
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:11,240
well first of all they're not insects um

117
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:15,879
you know to be an insect you have as an

118
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:20,720
adult six pair of legs um um anteni

119
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:25,839
where if you look at this group which

120
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:27,440
they are a kind of isopod isopod incor

121
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:31,719
incomp

122
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:37,279
incorporates um a lot of of different

123
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:40,800
animals out there um but there are some

124
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:43,599
specific families that these I'm going

125
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,759
to call them generic rly py because

126
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,120
there are a lot of different Regional

127
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,199
names for them uh just like how some

128
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:53,840
people call lightning bugs and fireflies

129
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:55,280
different names um that it's the same

130
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:58,279
kind of thing that there's a lot of

131
00:05:55,279 --> 00:06:00,159
different names um you know woodlouse is

132
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:04,959
often used a little more I don't want to

133
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:07,120
say scientific um than Ry poly um but

134
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:09,359
they get their name Ry poly a bunch of

135
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,160
them because they can roll up and that's

136
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,479
the

137
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:18,280
group um that you have the armadilla

138
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:22,519
daier um which it makes sense because

139
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:25,879
they roll up like armadillos um and so

140
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:29,598
um that is

141
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:32,159
uh kind of where they rest and I I did

142
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:34,000
do a little checking cuz I am not a rly

143
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,000
pulley expert cuz you know I work more

144
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,839
with insects and mites and

145
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,160
nematodes um but it looks like none of

146
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:44,399
them are actually native uh to North

147
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,240
America and when I say if you look up

148
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:51,918
isopods of course there's native isopods

149
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:54,918
but um the genuses of the ones that

150
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:58,839
Growers are using or a lot of them that

151
00:06:54,918 --> 00:07:02,478
are found Outdoors are not native they

152
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:06,839
have been either a brought in

153
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:09,399
accidentally um with uh soil um from the

154
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:11,318
Mediterranean region from Europe um

155
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:16,439
other parts of the country or by people

156
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:18,520
buying them and then um them escaping or

157
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:22,079
people dumping out their soils when

158
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:23,839
they're done with a crop um you know

159
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:26,639
it's it's a tough thing because a lot of

160
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:30,000
them now have been here in North America

161
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:32,160
for you know quite a long time and so

162
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,839
they are kind of established in the

163
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,879
ecology so they are kind of indigenous

164
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:42,719
but they're not actually native but uh

165
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:47,199
you know I get real squirly about you

166
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:48,879
know moving animals around um without

167
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:52,560
the proper permits and without the

168
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:55,000
research that's been done proving that

169
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,720
it's okay to move them around because

170
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,879
historically a lot of mistakes have been

171
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:04,360
made um today to get perits from the

172
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:07,560
USDA is a multi-year very painful

173
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:09,038
process and pretty much from you know

174
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,399
the spectrum that I the side that I

175
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:13,878
worked on with the biological control

176
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:17,918
we're not getting anything new into the

177
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:21,240
US um unless it's it's a species that's

178
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:24,680
here already um that that's been well

179
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:27,759
documented here so um as far as

180
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:30,158
management goes I don't think anybody's

181
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:33,399
really surveyed to know exact

182
00:08:30,158 --> 00:08:36,080
which species are causing

183
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:39,479
problems um in them because I'm going to

184
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,519
guess it's not just one species of roly

185
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:43,038
poly out there because of people coming

186
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,679
from different regions and again I know

187
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:47,759
some people buy them and release them um

188
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:50,079
I've had numerous Growers contact me and

189
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:53,278
as as you mentioned there seems to be

190
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:55,040
that common denominator of of the heavy

191
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:56,679
mulching um because I think that

192
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:58,958
provides a perfect environment you know

193
00:08:56,679 --> 00:09:00,439
you go outside you whatever you pull up

194
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:03,919
your mul

195
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:08,160
um you can find rly pulley down under

196
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:10,599
there um um because they are they

197
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:12,519
basically are decomposers and you know

198
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:15,278
that's what mulch does on the bottom

199
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:20,078
it's it's it's decomposing between the

200
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:22,320
media um and uh the actual mulch layer

201
00:09:20,078 --> 00:09:24,120
itself and so I mean it does create a

202
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,000
perfect habitat but the problem is is

203
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,360
with anything too much of a good thing

204
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,919
is not a good thing um and the numbers

205
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,480
can get out of control

206
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:37,000
and I mean i' I've actually seen them um

207
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:39,920
beat on tomatoes um as well as cannabis

208
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,278
and as far as control honestly I mean I

209
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:43,360
hate to say it the Growers I've worked

210
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:46,759
up we've kind of ended up vacuuming a

211
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,639
lot out um I mean I kind of understand

212
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:52,639
the idea if you provide them an

213
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:54,679
alternate food source that they'll feed

214
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:56,720
on that and not so much your crop but

215
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:59,439
you that's a gamble because you don't

216
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,560
always know again what species with the

217
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,720
environment is and what they prefer on

218
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:05,599
and providing them a perfect habitat

219
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,639
with a lot of food for reproduction can

220
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,639
just really boost their numbers even

221
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:13,958
higher which could create a bigger

222
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:16,039
issue um if you're a homeg grower and

223
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:18,439
just have a few plants and you can put

224
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:23,360
sticky collars around the base of your

225
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:25,320
plants for for trapping that can work um

226
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,039
I will tell you that we've had when

227
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:30,839
people have used products like tangle

228
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:32,599
foot it creates a moisture layer and uh

229
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:34,600
we've seen where the plants has have

230
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:39,560
tried to grow roots out in that area and

231
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:41,639
it looks really weird um but also um

232
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:44,679
when you start getting into trapping

233
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:49,000
like that it's non- selective and you

234
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:53,239
can you know you can you can catch good

235
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:56,919
things as well as bad things um and you

236
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:58,600
know if you're relying on um you know

237
00:10:56,919 --> 00:11:00,319
predatory mites to be able to run up and

238
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,800
down the stocks your plans and things

239
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:07,079
like that you may end up trapping uh

240
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:11,759
some of your beneficials there um on

241
00:11:07,078 --> 00:11:14,278
it yes can I can I touch on something

242
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:15,759
so the way we're talking about these

243
00:11:14,278 --> 00:11:19,200
roly py right now is that they're

244
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:22,559
they're a pest and they do have uh they

245
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:25,680
are classified as a a pest of minor

246
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:26,479
importance by um you know some of these

247
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:29,799
uh

248
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:32,480
universities and such but really do have

249
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:33,879
a lot of benefits to soil health so I

250
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,039
want to acknowledge it in the healthy

251
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:39,720
ecosystem a lot of times you will find

252
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:41,039
them in you know proper quantities or

253
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,959
concentrations they're not out of

254
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:47,120
control and they do uh like you said

255
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:49,599
they do have a very a decomposing sort

256
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,639
of behavior where they'll eat dead plant

257
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,000
material shred it break it down further

258
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:56,959
which allows microbes to better access

259
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,879
the carbon and such in there so it it

260
00:11:56,958 --> 00:12:01,838
they will help mineralize soil and

261
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:04,600
mineral ize um organic matter so there

262
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,760
are some benefits to them um it's when

263
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,839
they get out of control in these indoor

264
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:10,480
systems I think that we have problems

265
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:13,920
like I I would

266
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:17,600
be I would be surprised to see a lot of

267
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:19,399
issues outdoors with these with with

268
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:23,519
roly police but maybe maybe it does

269
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:27,198
happen it does happen um also um where

270
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:30,360
you can in times of drought if you have

271
00:12:27,198 --> 00:12:32,559
again crops with water content in them

272
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:35,320
and they're looking for moisture to feed

273
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:37,799
on um that sometimes can drive some

274
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:43,000
unusual behaviors

275
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:46,078
um in nature when it's outside you have

276
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:49,519
predators of them to keep them in check

277
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:52,000
and this is again it's a numbers game

278
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,440
which you know everything it's it's it's

279
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,519
keeping numbers in check and this is

280
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,160
true with anything I mean like hey an

281
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,839
aspirin's great for a headache but if

282
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:59,719
you eat an entire bottle it's G to kill

283
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:03,279
you

284
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:05,399
um and so the same thing like with roly

285
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:09,838
poy to have the proper number around but

286
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:12,078
you're taking them out of their ecolog

287
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,519
that complete ecology and force them

288
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:16,278
into a very artificial ecology and I

289
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:18,278
think what's tough is people are trying

290
00:13:16,278 --> 00:13:21,320
to create Outdoors indoors but they're

291
00:13:18,278 --> 00:13:23,198
missing a lot of the key elements um

292
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:25,680
where you don't have the Predators you

293
00:13:23,198 --> 00:13:28,120
don't have frogs you don't have lizards

294
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:30,278
you don't have and I'm sure there are

295
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:33,879
some I guess they technically wouldn't

296
00:13:30,278 --> 00:13:35,399
be inop pathogens they would probably be

297
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:36,958
armadil

298
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:41,360
di

299
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:43,719
pathogens um that keep them in in check

300
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,399
um even flooding oh you know some of

301
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:49,240
them die because they've drowned or

302
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:51,198
drought and and the people are trying to

303
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,159
cherry-pick just a few things from the

304
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:54,359
ecology they think are going to be good

305
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:56,679
for their soil because we've been told

306
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:59,240
they're good for the soil but there's so

307
00:13:56,679 --> 00:14:02,519
many pieces of the puzzle we're missing

308
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:06,039
and so it it it the wheel doesn't run as

309
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:08,360
smoothly as it should um I you know I

310
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:11,278
often think about how important wind and

311
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:13,240
rain is for plants outdoors and when you

312
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:15,919
bring them inside you don't get that

313
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:18,120
natural every time it rains you know

314
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:20,519
kind of leeching the soil out and

315
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:22,440
washing the soil and adding that um

316
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:25,560
because you don't have that in an indoor

317
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:27,680
environment and I can appreciate and

318
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:29,919
understand the direction and what

319
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:33,758
Growers are trying to do

320
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:35,360
and I I get that I just think we need to

321
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:37,839
think bigger

322
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,399
about not just cherry-picking a few

323
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,279
things and throwing them in and being

324
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:43,679
like yeah now you know we're going to

325
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:46,559
have this you know healthy soil with

326
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:46,559
missing a lot of the

327
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:51,439
pieces yeah I I've talked about this

328
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:53,360
with other people on the show and I've

329
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,040
and on my social media this idea of

330
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,959
biomimicry that we're trying that people

331
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:59,679
are trying to create indoors

332
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:02,838
and it frankly it's a it's it's a lovely

333
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:05,479
idea that I resonates with me

334
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:08,440
emotionally but like you said ecology is

335
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:11,560
very complex biodiversity is so complex

336
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:13,519
so us adding in you know 10 more plants

337
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:16,119
in the form of cover crops into our

338
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:17,919
indoor garden does not suddenly create

339
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:20,078
an ecology that's going to match what we

340
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:21,639
would see outdoors and part of that like

341
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:24,559
you mentioned is we don't have the same

342
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:28,360
pathogens that are helping control some

343
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:32,000
of these you know insects or roly py or

344
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:33,759
other other biota that we have in our

345
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
soil so I think that's a really good

346
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:40,360
point that you brought up there um let's

347
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:43,000
talk about pyrans because I was trying

348
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:45,278
to remember in my head I'm thinking I

349
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,519
know they're dered from crysanthemum I

350
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:50,078
know that you don't like them therefore

351
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:53,440
I don't really or you don't usually

352
00:15:50,078 --> 00:15:57,399
recommend them you it it is I it's not I

353
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:59,519
and I have recommended them for the

354
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:02,240
right usage

355
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:05,720
and the thing is is I think with

356
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:10,318
cannabis because of their limited access

357
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:13,199
to pesticides for the legal Growers um I

358
00:16:10,318 --> 00:16:16,719
think pyrans just have been overused

359
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:20,559
because of lack of access or not not

360
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:25,759
access but the legality of using other

361
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:27,159
chemistries um and I I also think people

362
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:30,120
you know have this idea just because

363
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:34,159
something comes from a plant it's safe

364
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:38,159
um and we all should know better than

365
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:43,000
that so the so is the issue with

366
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:45,240
pyrin mostly uh overuse in the sense of

367
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,879
pest developing resistance to it or

368
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:50,079
there other potential risks or

369
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:52,360
non-target organism effects if you were

370
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:54,879
to use them for like say drenching the

371
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:58,959
soil because I did find one article

372
00:16:54,879 --> 00:17:01,879
talking about um isopods showing

373
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:04,720
avoidance behaviors to soil that was

374
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:07,599
contaminated with pyin versus a soil

375
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,439
that was not but um I wasn't able to

376
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:11,078
find anything directly saying that they

377
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:16,640
would

378
00:17:11,078 --> 00:17:18,000
kill uh daop Poots so as you mentioned

379
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:22,280
you know

380
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:24,798
pythons do come from um chrysanthemums

381
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:25,838
that's kind of how this all got started

382
00:17:24,798 --> 00:17:29,400
they

383
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:30,879
are basically they affect for ins their

384
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:34,440
nervous system this is where most of the

385
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:37,480
research has been done on insects um and

386
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:40,400
it's it affects their sodium channels

387
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:42,480
what affects their nerves so they lose I

388
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,840
mean if you watch an insect die after

389
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:48,400
exposure to pyrin you know they get kind

390
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:51,119
of Twitchy because their muscles just

391
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:55,720
kind of fire and then they just kind of

392
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:58,079
die now humans um you know discovered

393
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:00,558
this this is like such a cool thing and

394
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:02,678
at the time I mean it and you know I'm

395
00:18:00,558 --> 00:18:04,319
not going to knock pesticides I mean you

396
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:06,880
can argue that they've been completely

397
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:10,000
bad but also everybody enjoys having

398
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:13,080
cheap food today and you know a lot of

399
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
our cheap food system um has to do with

400
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:18,558
the development of pesticides and

401
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:21,558
allowing us to grow a lot of crops um

402
00:18:18,558 --> 00:18:25,359
but pyrans themselves growing enough

403
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:27,200
chrysanthemums to extract the pyrin out

404
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:31,199
is very expensive so that's why humans

405
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:33,080
developed synthetic py roids um and

406
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,120
those are the products you get in things

407
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:38,918
like

408
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:42,279
bifenthrin um which are used a lot for

409
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:46,159
Structural Pest Management um if you

410
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:48,000
live um or if you grow plants in the

411
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:50,520
Southeastern portion of the United

412
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,519
States Texas up towards I think we're

413
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:57,558
now hitting up to Virginia um and you're

414
00:18:53,519 --> 00:19:01,000
going to transport plants you have to

415
00:18:57,558 --> 00:19:03,000
incorporate um bifenthrin which is a or

416
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,759
one of the synthetic pyrethroids into

417
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:09,159
the media because synthetic pyrethroids

418
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:11,919
are really good

419
00:19:09,159 --> 00:19:14,159
repellants this and this keeps the fance

420
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,679
from going into the pots and it repels

421
00:19:14,159 --> 00:19:19,760
them out they do it in the Pacific

422
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:22,440
Northwest to keep weevils out of of

423
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:24,079
containerized plants too why they use it

424
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,880
a lot for Structural Pest Management

425
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:27,558
around windows and doors is because an

426
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,960
insect walks up and they're like Boop

427
00:19:27,558 --> 00:19:32,519
don't want to be either that and and it

428
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:35,679
repels them away so the this this the

429
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:39,798
pyin pyrethroids yes there's definite

430
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:42,798
repellency qualities to these

431
00:19:39,798 --> 00:19:47,038
chemistries but when humans developed

432
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:48,918
the synthetic pyth roid compounds and

433
00:19:47,038 --> 00:19:51,839
they started in all the homeowner

434
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:54,679
products Turf people used them nurseries

435
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:56,879
used them everybody used them resistance

436
00:19:54,679 --> 00:20:00,640
happened very quickly and so there's a

437
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:02,880
lot of resistance to to this group so

438
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,320
and this is something that it's very

439
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,039
important to understand with resistance

440
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:10,798
just because you've never used a

441
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:14,200
chemistry that doesn't mean the insects

442
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:17,759
or mites you have have not been exposed

443
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:20,919
to it so it's very possible for you to

444
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:23,798
get you know never have used a

445
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:27,520
pyrine and you spray it and it didn't

446
00:20:23,798 --> 00:20:30,279
work that's because the the insects you

447
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:32,000
have gotten um have a history of

448
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:33,759
exposure even though you haven't exposed

449
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,839
them one of the very famous problems

450
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:39,919
we've dealt with in the United States is

451
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:41,079
when we got um U bmia uh White fly here

452
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:44,759
in the United

453
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:47,240
States um and it was resistant to many

454
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:49,679
many chemistries and it wasn't because

455
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:51,759
of what was sprayed in the United States

456
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:54,000
um in Spain because they have large

457
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:55,440
Greenhouse systems there they had used

458
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,960
uh the synthetic

459
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:00,000
pyrethroids um I'm sorry sorry they used

460
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:02,120
the neonic noids very heavily and when

461
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:06,640
those white flies made it here from

462
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:08,918
Spain they were resistant um so the

463
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:12,200
resistance we have can come from other

464
00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:14,559
countries and other regions um but again

465
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:17,278
with the pyin

466
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:20,319
pyrethroids pyin are the natural pids

467
00:21:17,278 --> 00:21:22,400
are the synthetic version um they've

468
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:25,319
been cheap they've been used for decades

469
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:27,320
so there is so my concern one is

470
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:29,240
resistance and it's not something you

471
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:32,079
can just spray over and over and use

472
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:34,440
over and over in your facility um

473
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:35,918
because it it you would definitely will

474
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:37,640
develop resistance that's number one

475
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:41,520
number two they're definitely

476
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:42,960
non-selective um that it it doesn't you

477
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:45,720
know it's not like the chemistry is

478
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:48,319
Ascension being that would be like hey

479
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:50,480
you know might or hey aphid or hey

480
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:52,200
ladybug are you good or bad because I'm

481
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:55,440
only going to kill the bad one you know

482
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:58,080
it doesn't do that um they're very

483
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,360
non-selective um then my next concern is

484
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:01,480
persist

485
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:04,359
distance I've actually you know talked

486
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:07,480
to the researchers that um have worked a

487
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:09,359
lot with the natural pyre renss and they

488
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:11,038
talk about how quickly they break down

489
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:13,199
and I asked like under what conditions

490
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:16,400
and what they've looked at is outdoor

491
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:19,000
row crops you know in the sun in the

492
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:21,320
rain where it does break down quickly

493
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:24,278
when I started asking about well what if

494
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:26,759
it's you know indor grows and you don't

495
00:22:24,278 --> 00:22:29,599
there's no irrigation and it's sub

496
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:33,278
irrigation and there hasn't been it

497
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:35,918
seems like a lot of work on that um but

498
00:22:33,278 --> 00:22:39,400
I did uh get some information like when

499
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:42,799
it it's used in stored grains to keep

500
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:44,480
stored grain pests out in cooler

501
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:48,158
temperatures in the dark like that it

502
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:52,558
can persist for months um I do know

503
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:56,320
indoors in cannabis um we have done some

504
00:22:52,558 --> 00:22:58,879
Leaf tissue analysis where um pyrin were

505
00:22:56,319 --> 00:23:01,798
sprayed and we tested and even three

506
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,960
weeks out um there was still very low

507
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:07,519
but there were still detectable levels

508
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:07,519
of uh pyrin on the

509
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:15,519
foliage wow are there any health risks

510
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:19,119
or Reis associated with pyin or

511
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:22,240
pyrethroids absolutely um they all have

512
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:24,119
Reis because they are registered

513
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,960
pesticides and that's something that

514
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:29,558
concerns me um sometimes with the

515
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:32,400
Cannabis industry cuz um not all

516
00:23:29,558 --> 00:23:34,678
cannabis Growers carry um pesticide

517
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:37,440
licensing and I think to me what's

518
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:39,840
important about the pesticide licensing

519
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:43,798
is learning and understanding how to

520
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:47,079
read um pesticide labels understanding

521
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:49,440
Reis um post Harvest intervals what PPE

522
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:51,119
is required you know a lot of people are

523
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,519
like oh it's you know big government you

524
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:55,479
know trying to take control and blah

525
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:57,480
blah no they're trying to keep you from

526
00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:01,839
killing yourself because these are

527
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:04,240
pesticides I mean they they can kill you

528
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:06,399
um they can I mean that's what they're

529
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:09,278
designed to do they kill things and it's

530
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:11,880
again it's a dosage thing now if you're

531
00:24:09,278 --> 00:24:16,759
spraying pyrans you know is it going to

532
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:19,760
kill you no um but the thing that I

533
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:22,960
think about is the long-term lowd dose

534
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:25,278
Expos exposure of constant exposure to

535
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,919
these things if you're again outdoor in

536
00:24:25,278 --> 00:24:29,359
a rad crop environment where you've got

537
00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:30,880
rain sunlight microbial like to be so

538
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:34,839
many things are going

539
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:37,200
on things down when when you go into an

540
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:40,199
indoor grow environment which is not

541
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:44,360
like outdoor everything changes and I

542
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:46,558
don't think we fully understand how

543
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:49,398
chemistries break down in those

544
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:51,839
environments how they persist in those

545
00:24:49,398 --> 00:24:54,839
environments um it's just we just don't

546
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:56,678
know yet and I would not say not to use

547
00:24:54,839 --> 00:24:58,918
it if if it's something that was the

548
00:24:56,679 --> 00:25:02,120
right use you followed the labeled you

549
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:04,240
wore the right PPE you waited the proper

550
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:06,918
REI the re-entry and AAL before you

551
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:10,278
entered back in or your employees you

552
00:25:06,919 --> 00:25:14,200
know that's fine but I wouldn't just go

553
00:25:10,278 --> 00:25:14,200
using pesticides willy-nilly

554
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,960
you brought up two things that I think

555
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:21,839
are worth spending a little more time on

556
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,319
and and I didn't I wasn't aware that

557
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:25,678
makes a lot of sense about how things

558
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:27,119
would break down much slower indoors

559
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,798
than outdoors and how that might

560
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:32,158
increase exposure or even even

561
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:34,158
potentially contamination on the leaf

562
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:36,720
tissue itself of the final cannabis

563
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:38,320
product in this case but the two things

564
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:42,200
I wanted to talk a little bit more about

565
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:44,158
was REI which is return entry interval

566
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,919
and when we're we're talking about that

567
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:47,919
uh what that is it's on a pesticide

568
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:50,038
label telling you how long you need to

569
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:53,480
stay out of that space before you can go

570
00:25:50,038 --> 00:25:57,599
back into it without PPE um after

571
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:59,839
spraying uh pesticide is that correct Su

572
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:03,319
correct me if I yeah yeah yeah it's it's

573
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:05,879
the re it it's it it it and this is the

574
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:10,639
crazy thing

575
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:13,760
this you're given these Reis um and it's

576
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:16,120
for your employees to stay out this is

577
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:20,038
the one of the problems I have with this

578
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:21,519
rule is that it doesn't imply it doesn't

579
00:26:20,038 --> 00:26:23,919
apply to

580
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:26,558
non-employees so if you've got a garden

581
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:28,799
center and you want to come in and spray

582
00:26:26,558 --> 00:26:31,240
a product with like a 4hh hour

583
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:32,759
REI your employees can't go back to

584
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,880
those plants for 4 hours but your

585
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:38,519
customers

586
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:41,480
can so um yeah and that's I I that's

587
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:43,879
horrible I don't know I'm going to guess

588
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:47,079
you know there was probably some weird

589
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:48,960
lobbying or something because you know

590
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:50,798
for for the public and this is why

591
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,880
there's been some of that where you need

592
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:54,398
to put the law the signs on your Lawns

593
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,520
posting that this was sprayed with a

594
00:26:54,398 --> 00:26:58,319
chemistry kind of thing because I think

595
00:26:56,519 --> 00:27:01,398
people need need to be aware but that

596
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:02,480
that doesn't apply in all areas and

597
00:27:01,398 --> 00:27:04,879
sometimes that you know is something

598
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:08,278
that has to be

599
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:11,480
requested um that you know that you get

600
00:27:08,278 --> 00:27:13,558
notification um of of it every every

601
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:16,200
state is different on on that

602
00:27:13,558 --> 00:27:19,798
notifications for those outdoor

603
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:22,679
applications um but that or REI is very

604
00:27:19,798 --> 00:27:25,200
important because again that's that's

605
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:27,559
what the government has deemed is safe

606
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,880
for your employees to go back in now

607
00:27:27,558 --> 00:27:31,599
it's interesting

608
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:36,720
because in the United

609
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:41,000
States a lot of the newer stuff has 4our

610
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:46,798
Reis on it um older chemistries you'd

611
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:48,720
see uh Reis as long as 48 Hours um most

612
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:52,158
my most of my

613
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:54,558
ornamental Growers don't want anything

614
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:55,919
more than 4 hours 12 is really difficult

615
00:27:54,558 --> 00:27:58,960
because that means their employees can't

616
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:01,799
go into that facility for 12 hours

617
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:05,319
and um

618
00:28:01,798 --> 00:28:07,319
I I think with cannabis um because of

619
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:09,678
just the hands on

620
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:12,158
nature the way people grow I think

621
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:14,880
sometimes those Reis are overlooked and

622
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:17,799
I think it's from lack of understanding

623
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,799
um on the

624
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:24,918
label yeah I had reached out to you

625
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:29,440
because uh someone in a Reddit Forum had

626
00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:33,600
suggested a product at another you know

627
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:35,600
organic uh supplier and I wasn't

628
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:37,398
familiar with the product and someone

629
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:39,000
said oh just apply this and it'll fix

630
00:28:37,398 --> 00:28:40,398
your problem and I I want to make a a

631
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,798
video around this here so I don't want

632
00:28:40,398 --> 00:28:45,119
to give it all way on the podcast but

633
00:28:42,798 --> 00:28:47,839
essentially I sent it to you and you

634
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:52,759
said oh yeah this this has been around

635
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:54,879
forever uh but it has a 48h hour REI and

636
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:56,558
I guarantee I mean because these guys

637
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,200
sell stuff mostly to Hom Growers I

638
00:28:56,558 --> 00:28:59,960
guarantee most people either don't know

639
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:03,000
that or they're not waiting 2 days to go

640
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:06,759
look at their indoor plants again um no

641
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:08,480
hom grower I know of does that so uh you

642
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:10,398
know it's it's scary to me to think

643
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,079
about what people might be exposing

644
00:29:10,398 --> 00:29:14,158
themselves to

645
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:16,038
unintentionally uh and so yeah I look

646
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:18,039
forward to working with you on maybe

647
00:29:16,038 --> 00:29:20,038
clarifying some of these label terms in

648
00:29:18,038 --> 00:29:21,798
a you know a short series or something

649
00:29:20,038 --> 00:29:23,679
video series in the future yeah and I've

650
00:29:21,798 --> 00:29:25,158
got to go back and reread that label

651
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:28,320
because again I mean that product's been

652
00:29:25,159 --> 00:29:31,360
around for decades and it's just never

653
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:34,839
gain traction because the long long RI

654
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:38,558
but I it may require a respirator um for

655
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:40,959
application cuz a lot of um pesticides

656
00:29:38,558 --> 00:29:43,000
you need a a respirator and the

657
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,240
government now you need you need a a

658
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:49,519
respirator that's custom fit to your

659
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:51,359
face um so you don't get leaks in it and

660
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:53,159
um because it's all about keeping the

661
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:56,959
stuff out of your your lungs and and

662
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:59,559
your body and I don't know of any homeg

663
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:02,519
grower that is custom fitting

664
00:29:59,558 --> 00:30:04,440
respirators um the green houses and

665
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:05,720
stuff I work with they they have you

666
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,480
know checks where they check the

667
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:09,159
respirators to make sure they fit they

668
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:13,360
have training

669
00:30:09,159 --> 00:30:16,120
classes um on how to teach people how

670
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:18,678
to train to to check to make sure that

671
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:22,639
these respirators fit and everything and

672
00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:26,440
again this has kind of been a big driver

673
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:28,640
for more bio control because you don't

674
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:32,278
have these respirator requirements

675
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:33,679
and as more products get longer Reis

676
00:30:32,278 --> 00:30:35,960
even though again new products tend to

677
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:37,919
have shorter ones if you go up to Canada

678
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:40,240
Canada is just not even giving things

679
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,759
shorter than really 12-hour Reis anymore

680
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,679
just because they don't want anybody in

681
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:46,319
there for 12 hours after a products um

682
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:48,399
appli the United States is pretty

683
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:53,918
liberal and we have some pretty short

684
00:30:48,398 --> 00:30:56,518
Reis compared to um other countries um

685
00:30:53,919 --> 00:31:00,240
out there um

686
00:30:56,519 --> 00:31:03,399
but you know it's really important to

687
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:05,480
protect your lungs and yourself because

688
00:31:03,398 --> 00:31:07,839
again even though they come from plants

689
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:12,480
some of these are synthetic chemistries

690
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:12,480
I mean they are they are

691
00:31:12,798 --> 00:31:18,319
pesticides great and I just double

692
00:31:15,398 --> 00:31:22,918
checked on the US EPA website and on

693
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:25,278
this product and the um the REI is 48

694
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:28,480
hours now when I go to the website for

695
00:31:25,278 --> 00:31:30,919
the product it says oh it's uh food safe

696
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:33,720
insecticide mde that provides fast

697
00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:35,880
andure biochemical control for a wide

698
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:37,919
range of problem pest it's as safe as

699
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:42,159
soap it causes no skin irritation to

700
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:43,480
humans livestock or pets uh you know if

701
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:45,639
you get in your eyes just flush your

702
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:48,079
eyes with water it's it's like getting

703
00:31:45,638 --> 00:31:49,839
soap in your eye this is the faq's on

704
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:53,519
their website but when you go to the EPA

705
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:55,798
site a 48 hour hour REI is kind of scary

706
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:57,000
to me there's a there's a big disconnect

707
00:31:55,798 --> 00:31:58,278
between what they're putting on their

708
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,519
website and what looks it's like a

709
00:31:58,278 --> 00:32:04,359
totally safe organic EPA certified

710
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:07,079
product versus what's on their actual

711
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:09,719
label and and I will say sometimes when

712
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:13,319
products come to market for the first

713
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:15,759
time they might have an R High REI but

714
00:32:13,319 --> 00:32:18,000
then if the the product more research is

715
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:21,960
done they can come back and come back in

716
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:24,038
with a lower REI on it um that I have

717
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:27,480
seen that happen but again I've known

718
00:32:24,038 --> 00:32:29,759
about this product uh it's been 20

719
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:33,519
something years and if it's never been

720
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:36,240
lowered in 20 years it's I there's

721
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:39,159
something about it I don't know what it

722
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:42,638
is about the product because again if I

723
00:32:39,159 --> 00:32:45,720
can't no one I know will use a 48 hour

724
00:32:42,638 --> 00:32:46,918
product um no one and it's weird I

725
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,839
honestly I didn't even know this was

726
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:50,960
still on the market um I was kind of

727
00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:56,558
surprised when you contacted me that it

728
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:58,919
had it had resurfaced um again um but um

729
00:32:56,558 --> 00:33:01,079
the only place I could see a 48 hour REI

730
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:02,440
is outdoor row crops because you got the

731
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:03,960
tractor it will go out and spray it and

732
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,960
you don't have to worry about people

733
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:08,120
being out there working because those

734
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:10,558
crops will grow for weeks if not months

735
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:14,278
and nobody's out there but if you're in

736
00:33:10,558 --> 00:33:16,678
a a greenhouse a nursery a Canabis

737
00:33:14,278 --> 00:33:19,079
facility someone's going to be in there

738
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:22,038
in in more than 48 hours and just

739
00:33:19,079 --> 00:33:24,359
because we were talking about um pyrin

740
00:33:22,038 --> 00:33:26,278
um Panic which can be a very good

741
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:28,879
product um in the right situation that

742
00:33:26,278 --> 00:33:30,119
one does have a 12-hour I so if you are

743
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,919
going to use

744
00:33:30,119 --> 00:33:36,879
Panic you have a 12-hour re-entry

745
00:33:32,919 --> 00:33:40,799
interval um after applying it before you

746
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:44,480
your employees can you should be back in

747
00:33:40,798 --> 00:33:46,918
there great so the other thing I want to

748
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:49,519
touch on that you had brought up was

749
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:52,679
essentially non-target organism effects

750
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:54,720
so this idea that when we apply any for

751
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:56,320
any pesticide anything side that kills

752
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:59,679
something that it's just going to kill

753
00:33:56,319 --> 00:34:03,079
our Target Pest and not other beneficial

754
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:04,440
or innocuous organisms in our systems is

755
00:34:03,079 --> 00:34:08,199
is flawed

756
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:10,800
so like for an example one recently was

757
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:12,759
uh I saw people using mustard meal for

758
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:15,919
example to mustard seed meal to kill

759
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:18,040
fungus Nets and I started looking into

760
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:20,838
it yes it will kill fungus Nets but it's

761
00:34:18,039 --> 00:34:22,800
also going to kill other organisms that

762
00:34:20,838 --> 00:34:27,398
may recycle nutrients that have other

763
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:29,480
benefits in your soil as well uh so I

764
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:32,159
kind of want to just touch

765
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:34,320
on non-target organism effects now there

766
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:36,200
are some things that are very targeted

767
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:38,879
that we can use too I think of like

768
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:40,638
Bavaria for example in this regard as

769
00:34:38,878 --> 00:34:44,000
being a little bit more targeted than

770
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:46,000
say you know some of these

771
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:49,039
broadcasted things like mustard meal but

772
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:54,838
what what are your thoughts so and and

773
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:58,519
this is this is a challenge in a way um

774
00:34:54,838 --> 00:35:00,239
for people that want to be

775
00:34:58,519 --> 00:35:03,199
sustainable and care about the

776
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:05,598
environment because the newer synthetic

777
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:08,759
pesticides that are coming to the market

778
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:12,680
um uh saltan is a very good example from

779
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:15,800
BASF it is very targeted it only kills a

780
00:35:12,679 --> 00:35:17,319
few species of spider mites spiderm

781
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:19,280
mites are a family it doesn't do

782
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:22,838
anything for broad mites it doesn't do

783
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:27,880
anything for russet mites it it it it's

784
00:35:22,838 --> 00:35:32,480
the way it works is very targeted so it

785
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:35,519
is one of these newer chemistries that

786
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:37,800
we can use over top of predatory mites

787
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:39,440
and has no impact on the predatory mites

788
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:41,320
I mean other than the water washing

789
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,800
action if you were going to spray but if

790
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:45,440
you were to spray a leaf put the

791
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:47,519
predatory mites pimus cucuma sski they

792
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:51,079
all just can go on and live their happy

793
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:53,599
lives um just like again the broad mites

794
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:56,039
would because it doesn't affect them it

795
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:58,240
it the the the chemical companies are

796
00:35:56,039 --> 00:36:00,480
really dialing

797
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:03,318
very specific targets there's like

798
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:06,079
Endeavor is another synthetic chemistry

799
00:36:03,318 --> 00:36:09,800
and it affects the mouth

800
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:11,000
Parts on um white flies and aphids

801
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:14,400
because their mouth parts are kind of

802
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:16,760
like turkey baster bulbs you know

803
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:19,000
simplifi oversimplifying but it stops

804
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:21,839
that muscle from being able to work so

805
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:27,280
they can't feed so again it's very

806
00:36:21,838 --> 00:36:32,358
targeted on those groups things that are

807
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:36,079
that that are more from nature the

808
00:36:32,358 --> 00:36:38,358
pyin Soaps and oils even they are non-

809
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:41,800
selective and they will just come in and

810
00:36:38,358 --> 00:36:46,279
kill everything um Bavaria even though

811
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:49,880
it can be more targeted um so Bavaria

812
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:51,920
basana is is a fungus um we consider an

813
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:53,960
inop pathogen because it does kill

814
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:57,159
insects but if you start looking at

815
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:59,119
labels you'll see there's numbers or

816
00:36:57,159 --> 00:37:01,000
letters after them because we have

817
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:03,039
different strains just like with

818
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:06,838
cannabis there is with these fungi and

819
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:08,960
the different strains can affect

820
00:37:06,838 --> 00:37:12,880
different pests differently and

821
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:15,880
different insects differently um and

822
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:19,119
even though bavar basana GHA is the most

823
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:21,640
common found one will not kill

824
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:23,440
everything when you apply it it will

825
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:24,719
kill some of your beneficials like it

826
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:27,960
will kill

827
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:30,279
orius but it's considered much safer

828
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:32,119
with predatory mites as long as use the

829
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:33,319
wettable powder formulation and this is

830
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:34,358
really getting into the deep into the

831
00:37:33,318 --> 00:37:36,559
pool because then you have to start

832
00:37:34,358 --> 00:37:39,119
looking at formulations and how they

833
00:37:36,559 --> 00:37:43,400
affect things but generally stuff that's

834
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:45,240
approved for organic farming is is

835
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:49,358
they're non- selective they kill good

836
00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:52,759
and bad where when you're looking at

837
00:37:49,358 --> 00:37:54,799
sustainability and being very targeted

838
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:58,560
and killing specific pests some of the

839
00:37:54,800 --> 00:38:02,760
newer pesticides actually

840
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:05,960
um are going to they're better for your

841
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:08,319
bio programs and to preserve your

842
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:10,318
ecology now most of these what I

843
00:38:08,318 --> 00:38:12,800
consider designer pesticides cannot be

844
00:38:10,318 --> 00:38:15,159
used in cannabis but they are being used

845
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:18,119
in ornamental and vegetable production

846
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:21,960
because we can keep our beneficials

847
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:27,680
going come in Target with these products

848
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:30,318
um but yeah sadly um again pyrethroids

849
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:34,358
um or pyren the natural ones are

850
00:38:30,318 --> 00:38:38,079
non-selective and they will wipe out um

851
00:38:34,358 --> 00:38:41,519
the beneficials that you do have um the

852
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:44,280
BTS which have been around for decades

853
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:46,960
now uh BT stands for basilis

854
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:49,519
thuringensis and same thing with that we

855
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:56,039
have multiple species there's Israeli

856
00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:58,079
insus there's zi uh there's um uh garia

857
00:38:56,039 --> 00:39:00,159
and each of these

858
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:04,480
is very targeted for groups the Israeli

859
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:07,440
insis is very targeted on flies and

860
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:09,639
that's what we um have commonly used for

861
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:12,639
fungus net management and it's something

862
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:14,719
that we can use to Target fungus Nets

863
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:17,279
that can work fine in conjunction with

864
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:21,439
beneficial nematodes soild dwelling

865
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:27,760
predatory mites and things like that um

866
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:31,318
where uh the chawi uh cawi um is used

867
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:33,520
for Caterpillar management but just like

868
00:39:31,318 --> 00:39:36,159
everything else you use it too much and

869
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:36,920
there are resistance issues with it so I

870
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:39,920
mean

871
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:43,200
if you know it's it's this fine line

872
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:44,880
because I love beneficial insects I mean

873
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:49,399
that's no big secret I've committed my

874
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:51,838
whole life to this but sometimes um it's

875
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:54,240
these these synthetic targeted

876
00:39:51,838 --> 00:39:58,400
pesticides are actually are I think from

877
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:59,759
a sustainability option um a targeted

878
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,280
Choice than going in with a

879
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:05,119
broadspectrum

880
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:06,960
pyin that's going to kill everything but

881
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:08,200
sometimes you're okay with killing

882
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,000
everything because you need to do a

883
00:40:08,199 --> 00:40:12,519
reset you just want to kill everything

884
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,880
and get back in pretty

885
00:40:12,519 --> 00:40:17,000
fast yeah so something like that where

886
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,519
you go and knock it's called a knockdown

887
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,838
spray or essentially trying to get

888
00:40:18,519 --> 00:40:23,400
levels back down to a point where you

889
00:40:20,838 --> 00:40:25,719
could come back in with beneficials or

890
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:28,039
something that's a little bit gentler so

891
00:40:25,719 --> 00:40:30,318
if you notice if let's say for example

892
00:40:28,039 --> 00:40:31,800
you weren't scouting in your indoor

893
00:40:30,318 --> 00:40:33,719
space and all of a sudden you realize

894
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:35,880
you have spidermites and they've gotten

895
00:40:33,719 --> 00:40:38,598
out of control you may want to come in

896
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:40,400
and do and we're not too far into flower

897
00:40:38,599 --> 00:40:42,519
I have to set all these different

898
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,400
parameters uh then you could come in

899
00:40:42,519 --> 00:40:47,119
with a knockdown spray and essentially

900
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:49,639
suffocate or kill a lot of them and then

901
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:52,519
follow that up with a beneficial

902
00:40:49,639 --> 00:40:54,440
application of the right beneficials to

903
00:40:52,519 --> 00:40:55,679
um potentially deal with all the little

904
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:58,480
ones that you weren't get and then move

905
00:40:55,679 --> 00:41:02,159
forward with your with your crop cycle

906
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:04,880
yep exactly it it's it's um yeah just

907
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:08,440
doing that knockdown spray

908
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:09,680
because it is very difficult today and

909
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:13,720
I'm sure there's going to be push back

910
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:16,799
when I say this to manage pest just with

911
00:41:13,719 --> 00:41:18,919
spray programs um because you don't get

912
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:21,480
the spray coverage

913
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:23,000
and if you're doing just a spray program

914
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:24,599
obviously it has to be done regularly

915
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:28,719
but you're just keeping your numbers in

916
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:31,519
in check um with that um but even with

917
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:33,118
that if you use the same mode of action

918
00:41:31,519 --> 00:41:35,280
repeatedly with there are a few

919
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:39,160
exceptions typically we don't see

920
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:43,760
resistance issues with soaps oils or um

921
00:41:39,159 --> 00:41:47,920
Bavaria basana um things like that um

922
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:49,440
but again uh pyren BTS if they you're

923
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,880
constantly using those you definitely

924
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:54,480
will develop resistance to repeatedly

925
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:56,000
using those and then your program can

926
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,240
get out of check your problems get out

927
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,719
of control then you want to come and do

928
00:41:57,239 --> 00:42:00,099
knockdown spray but your product's not

929
00:41:58,719 --> 00:42:07,480
working

930
00:42:00,099 --> 00:42:10,480
