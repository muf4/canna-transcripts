1
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:05,560
all right so I'm at one of the big box

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,599
stores today and I always like to look

3
00:00:05,559 --> 00:00:10,960
at plants and I'm doing that and these

4
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:13,400
are showing a classic nitrogen

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,719
deficiency they're yellowing from the

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:18,839
bottom up they have pale green growth

7
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:20,719
and at this point I think it's probably

8
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:22,879
I don't know the how these plants are

9
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:24,839
match one they're they're a little dry

10
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:26,160
right now uh but my guess is when they

11
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:27,800
are watered they're probably over

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,079
watered and they may have leeched the

13
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,960
nutrients out or they just might have

14
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:33,399
ran out of nutrients pot it's a pretty

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,200
small pot so what I would want to do in

16
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:38,600
a case like this is apply something like

17
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,559
a fish hydrolate um compost tea or

18
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,320
compost extract even some Le shap from

19
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:43,919
your compost bin which would all be

20
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,960
organic options to get nutrients in

21
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,679
there right away and get some available

22
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:51,039
nitrogen I wouldn't

23
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:52,519
do something like fish meal or fish bow

24
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,359
meals just going take too long all those

25
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,399
dry

26
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:58,280
AMS and here's some larger ones and you

27
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,239
can see here these These Are A much

28
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,759
darker green and they actually have

29
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:03,919
release fertilizer and there little

30
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:05,599
green dots that's probably the

31
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,280
difference why these look good and these

32
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:09,239
are also not organic so they're able to

33
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,719
do that um if anything I think these are

34
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:13,039
maybe a little heavy in nitrogen but you

35
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:15,640
can't really see that um color coming

36
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:19,840
through it slightly downward facing

37
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:23,118
leaves um is usually a side that too

38
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:27,560
much nitrogen and they're very dark

39
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:27,560
green aware other
