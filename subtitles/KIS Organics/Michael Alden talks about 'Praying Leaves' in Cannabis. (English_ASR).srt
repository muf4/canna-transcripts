1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,600
uh something I was thinking about the

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:06,160
other day I posted this on social media

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,000
I got a wide variety of responses and I

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:11,080
wanted to hear your thoughts about

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,320
cannabis leaves praying are you familiar

6
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,519
with what I'm talking about when I say

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:18,519
that it's this uh sort of 45 degree

8
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:20,839
angle Leaf angle that you get and this

9
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:23,439
has always been associated with a very

10
00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:27,118
happy plant you know you're getting good

11
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:29,560
uh turity in the in the stem apparently

12
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:30,640
um what are your thoughts on this

13
00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:32,199
because

14
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,719
one of the thoughts I was had as I was

15
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,160
in my room looking at this and that the

16
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:37,800
plants were getting way too much light

17
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:40,119
at the time and they weren't perfectly

18
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:41,839
happy in my opinion but yet they were

19
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:45,199
doing this praying motion I'm like this

20
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:47,800
is this is a less than optimal angle for

21
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:51,559
for receiving photons too versus you

22
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:52,718
know having them be completely flat um I

23
00:00:51,558 --> 00:00:57,198
don't know what are your thoughts about

24
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:58,960
it yeah so um forgetting the term is but

25
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:01,039
to me that would be because there's not

26
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,640
enough air flow um and so what the plant

27
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:06,478
is doing is it's trying to uh raise up

28
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:09,000
or expose more so the the bottom surface

29
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:11,799
of the leaf to get those stamata exposed

30
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,079
and get more air flow and eliminate some

31
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:17,400
of that um the the humidity that's

32
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:20,078
sticking right around the the stamata um

33
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,000
and so yeah I I would think that it's

34
00:01:20,078 --> 00:01:24,118
it's caused by not enough air flow going

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,239
through the facility or another way to

36
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:28,879
think about is the the VPD isn't high

37
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:30,239
enough um either too much humidity or

38
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:31,679
you know what what have you but

39
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:33,118
basically the plant's not transpiring

40
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,720
enough it wants to raise the leaves

41
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:36,759
expose the stamata more so to the air

42
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:40,560
flow to help drive a higher

43
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:40,560
transpiration gradient
